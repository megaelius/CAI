In explaining the physical origin of the jet composition of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), a more general
picture, i.e. the hybrid jet model (introduced another magnetization parameter $\sigma_{0}$
on the basis of the traditional fireball model), has been well studied in \cite{2015ApJ...801..103G}.
However, it still has not yet been applied to a large GRB sample. Here, we first employ the "top-down"
approach of \cite{2015ApJ...801..103G} to diagnose the photosphere properties at the central
engine to see how the hybrid model can account for the observed data as well, through applying a {\it
Fermi} GRB sample (8 bursts) with the detected photosphere component, as presented in \cite{2019ApJS..245....7L}.
We infer all physical parameters of a hybrid problem with three typical values of the radius of the
jet base ($r_{0}$ = 10$^{7}$ cm, 10$^{8}$ cm, and 10$^{9}$ cm). We find that the dimensionless entropy
for all the bursts shows $\eta\gg$ 1 while the derived (1+$\sigma_{0}$) for five bursts (GRB 081224,
GRB 110721A, GRB 090719, GRB 100707, and GRB 100724) is larger than unity, indicating that in addition
to a hot fireball component, another cold Poynting-flux component may also play an important role.
Our analysis also shows that a few time bins for all $r_{0}$ in GRB 081224 and GRB 110721A, the magnetization
parameter at $\sim$ 10$^{15}$cm (1+$\sigma_{\rm r15}$) is greater than unity, which implies that
internal-collision-induced magnetic reconnection and turbulence (ICMART) may be the mechanism
to power the non-thermal emission, rather than internal shocks. We conclude that a majority of bursts
(probably all) can be well explained by the hybrid jet problem.
