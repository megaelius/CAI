We perform a comprehensive study of the stellar population properties of quiescent galaxies as
a function of size and stellar mass to constrain the physical mechanism governing the stellar mass
assembly and the likely evolutive scenarios that explain their growth in size. After selecting
all the quiescent galaxies from the ALHAMBRA survey by the dust-corrected stellar mass$-$colour
diagram, we built a shared sample of $\sim850$ quiescent galaxies with reliable sizes from the HST.
The stellar population properties were retrieved using the SED-fitting code MUFFIT with various
sets of composite stellar population models. Age, formation epoch, metallicity, and extinction
were studied on the stellar mass$-$size plane as function of size through a Monte Carlo approach.
This accounted for uncertainties and degeneracy effects amongst stellar population properties.
The stellar population properties of quiescent galaxies and their stellar mass and size since $z\sim1$
are correlated. At fixed stellar mass, the more compact the quiescent galaxy, the older and richer
in metals it is ($1$Gyr and $0.1$dex, respectively). In addition, more compact galaxies may present
slight lower extinctions than their more extended counterparts at the same stellar mass ($<0.1$
mag). By means of studying constant regions of stellar population properties across the stellar
mass$-$size plane, we obtained empirical relations to constrain the physical mechanism that governs
the stellar mass assembly of the form $M_\star \propto r_\mathrm{c}^\alpha$, where $\alpha$ amounts
to $0.50-0.55 \pm 0.09$. There are indications that support the idea that the velocity dispersion
is tightly correlated with the stellar content of galaxies. The mechanisms driving the evolution
of stellar populations can therefore be partly linked to the dynamical properties of galaxies,
along with their gravitational potential.
