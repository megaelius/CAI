Rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized proto-neutron stars ("millisecond proto-magnetars")
are candidate central engines of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRB), superluminous supernovae
(SLSNe), and binary neutron star mergers. Magnetar birth may be accompanied by the fall-back of
stellar debris, lasting for seconds or longer following the explosion. Accretion alters the magnetar
evolution by (1) providing an additional source of rotational energy (or a potential sink, if the
propeller mechanism operates); (2) enhancing the spin-down luminosity above the dipole rate by
compressing the magnetosphere and expanding the polar cap region of open magnetic field lines;
(3) supplying an additional accretion-powered neutrino luminosity that sustains the wind baryon-loading,
even after the magnetar's internal neutrino luminosity has subsided. The more complex evolution
of the jet power and magnetization of an accreting magnetar more readily accounts for the high 56Ni
yields GRB SNe and irregular time evolution of some GRB light curves (e.g.~bursts with precursors
followed by a long quiescent interval before the main emission episode). Additional baryon-loading
from accretion-powered neutrino irradiation of the magnetar polar cap lengthens the timeframe
over which the jet magnetization is in the requisite range sigma ~< 1e3 for efficient gamma-ray emission,
thereby accommodating GRBs with ultra-long durations. Though accretion does not significantly
raise the maximum energy budget from the limit of <~ few 1e52 ergs for an isolated magnetar, it greatly
expands the range of magnetic field strengths and birth spin periods capable of powering GRB jets,
reducing the differences between the magnetar properties normally invoked to explain GRBs versus
SLSNe.
