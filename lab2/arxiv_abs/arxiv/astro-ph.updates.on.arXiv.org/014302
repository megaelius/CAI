We investigate the environmental dependence of the stellar populations of galaxies in SDSS DR7.
Echoing earlier works, we find that satellites are both more metal-rich (<0.1 dex) and older (<2
Gyr) than centrals of the same stellar mass. However, after separating star-forming, green valley
and passive galaxies, we find that the true environmental dependence of both stellar metallicity
(<0.03 dex) and age (<0.5 Gyr) is in fact much weaker. We show that the strong environmental effects
found when galaxies are not differentiated result from a combination of selection effects brought
about by the environmental dependence of the quenched fraction of galaxies, and thus we strongly
advocate for the separation of star-forming, green valley and passive galaxies when the environmental
dependence of galaxy properties are investigated. We also study further environmental trends
separately for both central and satellite galaxies. We find that star-forming galaxies show no
environmental effects, neither for centrals nor for satellites. In contrast, the stellar metallicities
of passive and green valley satellites increase weakly with increasing halo mass, increasing local
overdensity and decreasing projected distance from their central; this effect is interpreted
in terms of moderate environmental starvation (`strangulation') contributing to the quenching
of satellite galaxies. Finally, we find a unique feature in the stellar mass--stellar metallicity
relation for passive centrals, where galaxies in more massive haloes have larger stellar mass at
constant stellar metallicity; this effect is interpreted in terms of dry merging of passive central
galaxies and/or progenitor bias.
