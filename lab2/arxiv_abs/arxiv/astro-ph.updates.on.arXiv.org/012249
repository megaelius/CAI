Archival Vilnius CCD photometric observations are presented for the heavily reddened star cluster
Melotte 105, resulting in colour-magnitude diagrams and spectral class estimates. There is considerable
lack of agreement between studies for reddening, age, and distance for this cluster explaining
why the archival data are being made available by this paper. The derived reddening E(B-V =0.34 +/-
0.04 mag and the distance V-M =12.9 +/- 0.3 mag directly from the Vilnius photometry. The Gaia Data
Release 2 (DR2) and Vilnius photometric data of the cluster were used to estimate the structural
parameters of the cluster, probability of stellar membership in the cluster, the distance modulus
and the cluster age. Lack of $Y$ band observations prevented determination of metal abundance.
The values of the colour excess and distance module are determined by two different methods (i.e.,
Q and Zero Age Main Sequence, or ZAMS, methods). A distance modulus of 12.85 +/- 0.07 mag was derived
by ZAMS fitting, in good agreement with the above estimate. ZAMS fitting indicates a reddening of
0.403 +/- 0.02 mag, within two sigma of the estimate above. The cluster's metallicity and age are
estimated to be 0.24 dex and 240 +/-25 Myr, respectively. The derived mass function is in good agreement
with the Salpeter slope. The cluster space velocity components (U, V, W) were determined as (-3.90
+/- 3.34, -13.76 +/- 5.69, +3.45 +/- 0.41) km/s. Perigalactic and apogalactic distances were obtained
as R_{p} = 6.85 and R_{a} = 7.44 kpc respectively. The maximum vertical distance from the Galactic
plane was calculated as Z_{max} = 84 pc and the eccentricity of the orbit was determined as e = 0.042.
