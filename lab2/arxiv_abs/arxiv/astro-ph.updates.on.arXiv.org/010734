With the recent increase in precision of our cosmological datasets, measurements of $\Lambda$CDM
model parameter provided by high- and low-redshift observations started to be in tension, i.e.,
the obtained values of such parameters were shown to be significantly different in a statistical
sense. In~this work we tackle the tension on the value of the Hubble parameter, $H_0$, and the weighted
amplitude of matter fluctuations, $S_8$, obtained from local or low-redshift measurements and
from cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. We combine the main approaches previously
used in the literature by extending the cosmological model and accounting for extra systematic
uncertainties. With such analysis we aim at exploring non standard cosmological models, implying
deviation from a cosmological constant driven acceleration of the Universe expansion, in the presence
of additional uncertainties in measurements. In more detail, we reconstruct the Dark Energy equation
of state as a function of redshift, while we study the impact of type-Ia supernovae (SNIa) redshift-dependent
astrophysical systematic effects on these tensions. We consider a SNIa intrinsic luminosity dependence
on redshift due to the star formation rate in its environment, or the metallicity of the progenitor.
We find that the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions can be significantly alleviated, or~even removed, if we
account for varying Dark Energy for SNIa and CMB data. However, the tensions remain when we add baryon
acoustic oscillations (BAO) data into the analysis, even after the addition of extra SNIa systematic
uncertainties. This points towards the need of either new physics beyond late-time Dark Energy,
or other unaccounted systematic effects (particulary in BAO measurements), to fully solve the
present tensions.
