In analyses of rare-events, regardless of the domain of application, class-imbalance issue is
intrinsic. Although the challenges are known to data experts, their explicit impact on the analytic
and the decisions made based on the findings are often overlooked. This is in particular prevalent
in interdisciplinary research where the theoretical aspects are sometimes overshadowed by the
challenges of the application. To show-case these undesirable impacts, we conduct a series of experiments
on a recently created benchmark data, named Space Weather ANalytics for Solar Flares (SWAN-SF).
This is a multivariate time series dataset of magnetic parameters of active regions. As a remedy
for the imbalance issue, we study the impact of data manipulation (undersampling and oversampling)
and model manipulation (using class weights). Furthermore, we bring to focus the auto-correlation
of time series that is inherited from the use of sliding window for monitoring flares' history. Temporal
coherence, as we call this phenomenon, invalidates the randomness assumption, thus impacting
all sampling practices including different cross-validation techniques. We illustrate how failing
to notice this concept could give an artificial boost in the forecast performance and result in misleading
findings. Throughout this study we utilized Support Vector Machine as a classifier, and True Skill
Statistics as a verification metric for comparison of experiments. We conclude our work by specifying
the correct practice in each case, and we hope that this study could benefit researchers in other
domains where time series of rare events are of interest.
