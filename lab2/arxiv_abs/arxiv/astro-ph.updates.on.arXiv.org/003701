Eccentricity is an important orbital parameter. Understanding its effect on planetary climate
and habitability is critical for us to search for a habitable world beyond our solar system. The orbital
configurations of M-dwarf planets are always tidally-locked at resonance states, which are quite
different from those around Sun-like stars. M-dwarf planets need to be investigated separately.
Here we use a comprehensive three-dimensional atmospheric general circulation model to systematically
investigate how eccentricity influences climate and habitability of M-dwarf exoplanets. The
simulation results show that (1) the seasonal climatic cycles of such planets are very weak even
for e = 0.4. It is unlikely that an aqua planet falls out of a habitable zone during its orbit. (2) The
annual global mean surface temperature significantly increases with increased eccentricity,
due to the decrease of the cloud albedo. Both the runaway greenhouse inner edge and moist greenhouse
inner edge shift outward. (3) Planets in an eccentric orbit can be captured in other spin-orbit resonance
states which lead to different climate patterns, namely eyeball pattern and striped-ball pattern.The
striped-ball pattern has evidently higher surface temperatures due to the reduced planetary albedo.
Near the outer edge, planets with p = 1.0 and 2.0 are more resistant to the snowball state due to more
locally-concentrated stellar fluxes. Thus, planets with integer spin-orbit resonance numbers
have wider habitable zones than those with half-integer spin-orbit resonance states. Above all,
as a comparison to circular orbit, eccentricity shrinks the width of the habitable zone.
