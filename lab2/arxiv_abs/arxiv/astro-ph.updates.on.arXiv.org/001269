We present the results from Suzaku observations of the hottest Abell galaxy cluster A2163 at $z=0.2$.
To study the physics of gas heating in cluster mergers, we investigated hard X-ray emission from
the merging cluster A2163, which hosts the brightest synchrotron radio halo. We analyzed hard X-ray
spectra accumulated from two-pointed Suzaku observations. Non-thermal hard X-ray emission should
result from the inverse Compton (IC) scattering of relativistic electrons by the CMB photons. To
measure this emission, the dominant thermal emission in the hard X-ray band must be modeled in detail.
To this end, we analyzed the combined broad-band X-ray data of A2163 collected by Suzaku and XMM-Newton,
assuming single- and multi-temperature models for thermal emission and the power-law model for
non-thermal emission. From the Suzaku data, we detected significant hard X-ray emission from A2163
in the 12-60 keV band at the $28\sigma$ level (or at the $5.5\sigma$ level if a systematic error is
considered). The Suzaku HXD spectrum alone is consistent with the single-T thermal model of gas
temperature $kT=14$ keV. From the XMM data, we constructed a multi-T model including a very hot ($kT=18$
keV) component in the NE region. Incorporating the multi-T and the power-law models into a two-component
model with a radio-band photon index, the 12-60 keV energy flux of non-thermal emission is constrained
within $5.3 \pm 0.9 (\pm 3.8)\times 10^{-12}~{\rm erg\, s^{-1} cm^{-2}}$. The 90% upper limit of
detected IC emission is marginal ($< 1.2\times 10^{-11}~{\rm erg\, s^{-1} cm^{-2}}$ in the
12-60 keV). The estimated magnetic field in A2163 is $B > 0.098~{\rm \mu G}$. While the present
results represent a three-fold increase in the accuracy of the broad band spectral model of A2163,
more sensitive hard X-ray observations are needed to decisively test for the presence of hard X-ray
emission due to IC emission.
