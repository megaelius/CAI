We present a detailed analysis of the extended structure detected around the young and close-by
Herbig Ae/Be star RCrA. This is a young triple system with an intermediate mass central binary whose
separation is of the order of a few tens of the radii of the individual components, and an M-star companion
at about 30 au. Our aim is to understand the nature of the extended structure by means of combining
integral-field and high-resolution spectroscopy. We conducted the analysis based on FEROS archival
optical spectroscopy data and adaptive optics images and integral-field spectra obtained with
SINFONI and SPHERE at the VLT. The observations reveal a complex extended structure that is composed
of at least two components: a non-uniform wide cavity whose walls are detected in continuum emission
up to 400~au, and a collimated wiggling-jet detected in the emission lines of Helium and Hydrogen.
Moreover, the presence of [FeII] emission projected close to the cavity walls suggests the presence
of a slower moving wind, most likely a disk wind. The multiple components of the optical forbidden
lines also indicate the presence of a high-velocity jet co-existing with a slow wind. We constructed
a geometrical model of the collimated jet flowing within the cavity using intensity and velocity
maps, finding that its wiggling is consistent with the orbital period of the central binary. The
cavity and the jet do not share the same position angle, suggesting that the jet is itself experiencing
a precession motion possibly due to the wide M-dwarf companion. We propose a scenario that closely
agrees with the general expectation of a magneto-centrifugal-launched jet. These results build
upon the extensive studies already conducted on RCrA.
