We present a detailed near-infrared chemical abundance analysis of 10 red giant members of the Galactic
open cluster NGC 752. High-resolution (R$\simeq$45000) near-infrared spectral data were gathered
with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrograph (IGRINS), providing simultaneous coverage
of the complete H and K bands. We derived the abundances of H-burning (C, N, O), $\alpha$ (Mg, Si, S,
Ca), light odd-Z (Na, Al, P, K), Fe-group (Sc, Ti, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni) and neutron-capture (Ce, Nd, Yb)
elements. We report the abundances of S, P, K, Ce, and Yb in NGC 752 for the first time. Our analysis
yields solar metallicity and solar abundance ratios for almost all of the elements heavier than
the CNO group in NGC 752. O and N abundances were measured from a number of OH and CN features in the $H$
band, and C abundances were determined mainly from CO molecular lines in the K band. High excitation
\ion{C}{i} lines present in both near-infrared and optical spectra were also included in the C abundance
determinations. Carbon isotopic ratios were derived from the R-branch band heads of first overtone
(2-0) and (3$-$1) $^{12}$CO and (2-0) $^{13}$CO lines near 23440 \AA and (3-1) $^{13}$CO lines at
about 23730 \AA. The CNO abundances and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios are all consistent with our giants
having completed "first dredge-up" envelope mixing of CN-cyle products. We independently assessed
NGC 752 stellar membership from Gaia astrometry, leading to a new color-magnitude diagram for this
cluster. Applications of Victoria isochrones and MESA models to these data yield an updated NGC
752 cluster age (1.52 Gyr) and evolutionary stage indications for the program stars. The photometric
evidence and spectroscopic light element abundances all suggest that the most, perhaps all of the
program stars are members of the helium-burning red clump in this cluster.
