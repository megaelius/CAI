Fundamental stellar properties, such as mass, radius, and age, can be inferred using asteroseismology.
Cool stars with convective envelopes have turbulent motions that can stochastically drive and
damp pulsations. The properties of the oscillation frequency power spectrum can be tied to mass
and radius through solar-scaled asteroseismic relations. Stellar properties derived using these
scaling relations need verification over a range of metallicities. Because the age and mass of halo
stars are well-constrained by astrophysical priors, they provide an independent, empirical check
on asteroseismic mass estimates in the low-metallicity regime. We identify nine metal-poor red
giants (including six stars that are kinematically associated with the halo) from a sample observed
by both the Kepler space telescope and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III APOGEE spectroscopic survey.
We compare masses inferred using asteroseismology to those expected for halo and thick-disk stars.
Although our sample is small, standard scaling relations, combined with asteroseismic parameters
from the APOKASC Catalog, produce masses that are systematically higher (<{\Delta}M>=0.17+/-0.05
Msun) than astrophysical expectations. The magnitude of the mass discrepancy is reduced by known
theoretical corrections to the measured large frequency separation scaling relationship. Using
alternative methods for measuring asteroseismic parameters induces systematic shifts at the
0.04 Msun level. We also compare published asteroseismic analyses with scaling relationship masses
to examine the impact of using the frequency of maximum power as a constraint. Upcoming APOKASC observations
will provide a larger sample of ~100 metal-poor stars, important for detailed asteroseismic characterization
of Galactic stellar populations.
