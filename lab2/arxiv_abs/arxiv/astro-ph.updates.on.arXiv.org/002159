Dark-matter haloes are supposed to form at the positions of maxima in the initial matter density
field. The gravitational-shear field's ellipticity and prolaticity that serve as input for the
ellipsoidal-collapse model, however, are derived from a distribution that does not take the additional
maximum constraint into account. In this article, I quantify the variations of the most probable
and the expected values of the ellipticity and the prolaticity when considering this additional
constraint as well as the implications for the ellipsoidal-collapse model. Based on the statistics
of Gaussian random fields, it is possible to set up a joint distribution for the eigenvalues of the
gravitational-shear tensor and the matter density that incorporates the maximum constraint by
invoking a vanishing first derivative and a negative definite second derivative of the density
field into the calculation. In the density range relevant for cosmological structure formation,
both the most probable and the expected value of the ellipticity calculated from the standard distribution
used in the literature are about $3-8$ per cent higher compared to the ones calculated under the additional
assumption of a density maximum. Additionally, the analogous quantities for the prolaticity do
not vanish but acquire slightly positive values in the range of $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$. For large
overdensities, the predictions from both distributions converge. The values for $\delta_\mathrm{c}$
and $\Delta_\mathrm{v}$ derived from the ellipsoidal-collapse model using the standard distribution
for the initial ellipticity and prolaticity are up to $4$ and $6$ per cent higher, respectively,
than those obtained taking the additional maximum constraint into account in the range of $10^{13}$
to $10^{15}~h^{-1}~M_\odot$ in mass and $0$ to $2$ in redshift.
