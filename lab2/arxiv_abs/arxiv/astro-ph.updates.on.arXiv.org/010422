We present a clean, magnitude-limited (IRAC1 or WISE1 $\leq$ 15.0 mag) multiwavelength source
catalog for the SMC with 45,466 targets in total, with the purpose of building an anchor for future
studies, especially for the massive star populations at low-metallicity. The catalog contains
data in 50 different bands including 21 optical and 29 infrared bands, ranging from the ultraviolet
to the far-infrared. Additionally, radial velocities and spectral classifications were collected
from the literature, as well as infrared and optical variability statistics were retrieved from
different projects. The catalog was essentially built upon a $1''$ crossmatching and a $3''$ deblending
between the SEIP source list and Gaia DR2 photometric data. Further constraints on the proper motions
and parallaxes from Gaia DR2 allowed us to remove the foreground contamination. We estimated that
about 99.5\% of the targets in our catalog were most likely genuine members of the SMC. By using the
evolutionary tracks and synthetic photometry from MIST and the theoretical $\rm J-K_S$ color cuts,
we identified 1,405 RSG, 217 YSG and 1,369 BSG candidates in the SMC in five different CMDs, where
attention should also be paid to the incompleteness of our sample. We ranked the candidates based
on the intersection of different CMDs. A comparison between the models and observational data shows
that the lower limit of initial mass for the RSGs population may be as low as 7 or even 6 $M_{\odot}$
and the RSG is well separated from the AGB population even at faint magnitude, making RSGs a unique
population connecting the evolved massive and intermediate stars, since stars with initial mass
around 6 to 8 $M_{\odot}$ are thought to go through a second dredge-up to become AGBs. We encourage
the interested reader to further exploit the potential of our catalog.
