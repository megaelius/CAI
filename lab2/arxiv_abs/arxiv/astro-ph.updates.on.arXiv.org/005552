Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) waves are large-scale propagating disturbances observed in the solar
corona, frequently associated with coronal mass ejections and flares. They appear as faint, extended
structures propagating from a source region across the structured solar corona. Since their discovery,
over two hundred papers discussing their properties, causes and physical nature have been published.
However, despite this their fundamental properties and the physics of their interactions with
other solar phenomena are still not understood. To further the understanding of EUV waves, we have
constructed the Automated Wave Analysis and REduction (AWARE) algorithm for the measurement of
EUV waves. AWARE is implemented in two stages. In the first stage, we use a new type of running difference
image, the running difference persistence image, which enables the efficient isolation of propagating,
brightening wavefronts as they propagate across the corona. In the second stage, AWARE detects
the presence of a wavefront, and measures the distance, velocity and acceleration of that wavefront
across the Sun. The fit of propagation models to the wave progress isolated in the first stage is achieved
using the Random Sample and Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. AWARE is tested against simulations
of EUV wave propagation, and is applied to measure EUV waves in observational data from the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA). We also comment on unavoidable systematic errors that bias the estimation
of wavefront velocity and acceleration. In addition, the full AWARE software suite comes with a
package that creates simulations of waves propagating across the disk from arbitrary starting
points.
