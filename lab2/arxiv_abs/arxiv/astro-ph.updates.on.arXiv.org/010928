As an introduction of a kinematic survey of Magellanic Cloud (MC) star clusters, we report on the
dynamical masses and mass-to-light ($M/L$) ratios of NGC 419 (SMC) and NGC 1846 (LMC). We have obtained
more than one hundred high-resolution stellar spectra in and around each cluster using the multi-object
spectrograph M2FS on the $Magellan$/Clay Telescope. Line-of-sight velocities and positions
of the stars observed in each cluster were used as input to an expectation-maximization algorithm
used to estimate cluster membership probabilities, resulting in samples of 46 and 52 likely members
($P_{M}\geq 50$%) in NGC 419 and NGC 1846, respectively. This process employed single-mass King
models constrained by the structural parameters of the clusters and provided self-consistent
dynamical mass estimates for both clusters. Our best-fit results show that NGC 419 has a projected
central velocity dispersion of $2.44^{+0.37}_{-0.21}\ {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, corresponding to
a total mass of $7.6^{+2.5}_{-1.3}\times10^4\ {\rm M}_{\odot}$ and $V$-band $M/L$ ratio of $0.22^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$
in solar units. For NGC 1846, the corresponding results are $2.04^{+0.28}_{-0.24}\ {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$,
$5.4^{+1.5}_{-1.4}\times10^4\ {\rm M}_{\odot}$ and $0.32^{+0.11}_{-0.11}$. The mean metallicities
of NGC 419 and NGC 1846 are found to be $\rm [Fe/H]=-0.84\pm0.19$ and $-0.70\pm0.08$, respectively,
based on the spectra of likely cluster members. We find marginal statistical evidence of rotation
in both clusters, though in neither cluster does rotation alter our mass estimates significantly.
We critically compare our findings with those of previous kinematic studies of these two clusters
in order to evaluate the consistency of our observational results and analytic tools.
