Multiply-imaged quasars and AGNs observed in the mid-infrared (MIR) range are commonly assumed
to be unaffected by the microlensing produced by the stars in their lensing galaxy. In this paper,
we investigate the validity domain of this assumption. Indeed, that premise disregards microlensing
of the accretion disc in the MIR range, and does not account for recent progress in our knowledge of
the dusty torus. To simulate microlensing, we first built a simplified image of the quasar composed
of an accretion disc, and of a larger ring-like torus. The mock quasars are then microlensed using
an inverse ray-shooting code. We simulated the wavelength and size dependence of microlensing
for different lensed image types and fraction of compact objects projected in the lens. This allows
us to derive magnification probabilities as a function of wavelength, as well as to calculate the
microlensing-induced deformation of the spectral energy distribution of the lensed images. We
find that microlensing variations as large as 0.1 mag are very common at 11 microns (observer-frame).
The main signal comes from microlensing of the accretion disc, which may be significant even when
the fraction of flux from the disc is as small as 5 % of the total flux. We also show that the torus of sources
with Lbol <~ 10^45 erg/s is expected to be noticeably microlensed. Microlensing may thus be used
to get insight into the rest near-infrared inner structure of AGNs. Finally, we investigate whether
microlensing in the mid-infrared can alter the so-called Rcusp relation that links the fluxes of
the lensed images triplet produced when the source lies close to a cusp macro-caustic. This relation
is commonly used to identify massive (dark-matter) substructures in lensing galaxies. We find
that significant deviations from Rcusp may be expected, which means that microlensing can explain
part of the flux ratio problem.
