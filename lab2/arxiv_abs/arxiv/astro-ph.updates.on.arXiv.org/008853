Recent observations have found a valley in the size distribution of close-in super-Earths that
is interpreted as a signpost that close-in super-Earths are mostly rocky in composition. However,
new models predict that planetesimals should first form at the water ice line such that close-in
planets are expected to have a significant water ice component. Here we investigate the water contents
of super-Earths by studying the interplay between pebble accretion, planet migration and disc
evolution. Planets' compositions are determined by their position relative to different condensation
fronts (ice lines) throughout their growth. Migration plays a key role. Assuming that planetesimals
start at or exterior to the water ice line ($r>r_{\rm H_2O}$), inward migration causes planets to
leave the source region of icy pebbles and therefore to have lower final water contents than in discs
with either outward migration or no migration. The water ice line itself moves inward as the disc
evolves, and delivers water as it sweeps across planets that formed dry. The relative speed and direction
of planet migration and inward drift of the water ice line is thus central in determining planets'
water contents. If planet formation starts at the water ice line, this implies that hot close-in
super-Earths (r<0.3 AU) with water contents of a few percent are a signpost of inward planet migration
during the early gas phase. Hot super-Earths with larger water ice contents on the other hand, experienced
outward migration at the water ice line and only migrated inwards after their formation was complete
either because they become too massive to be contained in the region of outward migration or in chains
of resonant planets. Measuring the water ice content of hot super-Earths may thus constrain their
migration history.
