The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) is under construction to measure the expansion
history of the universe using the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) technique. The spectra of 35
million galaxies and quasars over $14000 \,\text{deg}^2$ will be measured during the life of the
experiment. A new prime focus corrector for the KPNO Mayall telescope will deliver light to 5000
robotically positioned optic fibres. The fibres in turn feed ten broadband spectrographs. Proper
alignment of focal plate structure, mainly consisting of a focal plate ring (FPR) and ten focal plate
petals (FPP), is crucial in ensuring minimal loss of light in the focal plane. A coordinate measurement
machine (CMM) metrology-based approach to alignment requires comprehensive characterisation
of critical dimensions of the petals and the ring, all of which were 100% inspected. The metrology
data not only served for quality assurance (QA), but also, with careful modelling of geometric transformations,
informed the initial choice of integration accessories such as gauge blocks, pads, and shims. The
integrated focal plate structure was inspected again on a CMM, and each petal was adjusted according
to the updated focal plate metrology data until all datums were extremely close to nominal positions
and optical throughput nearly reached the theoretically best possible value. This paper presents
our metrology and alignment methodology and complete results for twelve official DESI petals.
The as-aligned, total RMS optical throughput for 6168 positioner holes of twelve production petals
was indirectly measured to be $99.88 \pm 0.12 \%$, well above the 99.5% project requirement. The
successful alignment fully demonstrated the wealth of data, reproducibility, and micron-level
precision made available by our CMM metrology-based approach.
