One of the best ways to improve our understanding of the stellar activity-induced signal in radial
velocity (RV) measurements is through simultaneous high-precision photometric and RV observations.
This is of prime importance to mitigate the RV signal induced by stellar activity and therefore unveil
the presence of low-mass exoplanets. The K2 Campaign 7 and 8 field-of-views were located in the southern
hemisphere, and provided a unique opportunity to gather unprecedented simultaneous high precision
photometric observation with K2 and high-precision RV measurements with the HARPS spectrograph
to study the relationship between photometric variability and RV jitter. We observed nine stars
with different levels of activity; from quiet to very active. We probe the presence of any meaningful
relation between measured RV jitter and the simultaneous photometric variation, and also other
activity indicators (e.g. BIS, FWHM, $logR'_{HK}$, and F8), by evaluating the strength and significance
of the correlation between RVs and each indicator. We found that for the case of very active stars,
strong and significant correlations exist between almost all the observables and measured RVs;
however, for lower activity levels the correlations become random. Except for the F8 which its strong
correlation with RV jitter persists over a wide range of stellar activity level, and thus our result
suggests that F8 might be a powerful proxy for activity induced RV jitter. Moreover, we examine the
capability of two state-of-the-art modeling techniques, namely the FF' method and SOAP2.0, in
accurately predicting the RV jitter amplitude using the simultaneous photometric observation.
We found that for the very active stars both techniques can reasonably well predict the amplitude
of the RV jitter, however, at lower activity levels the FF' method underpredicts the RV jitter amplitude.
