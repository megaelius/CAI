We present a joint shear-and-magnification weak-lensing analysis of a sample of 16 X-ray-regular
and 4 high-magnification galaxy clusters at 0.19<z<0.69 selected from the Cluster Lensing
And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). Our analysis uses wide-field multi-color imaging, taken
primarily with Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope. From a stacked shear-only analysis of the X-ray-selected
subsample, we detect the ensemble-averaged lensing signal with a total signal-to-noise ratio
of ~25 in the radial range of 200 to 3500kpc/h. The stacked tangential-shear signal is well described
by a family of standard density profiles predicted for dark-matter-dominated halos in gravitational
equilibrium, namely the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), truncated variants of NFW, and Einasto models.
For the NFW model, we measure a mean concentration of $c_{200c}=4.01^{+0.35}_{-0.32}$ at $M_{200c}=1.34^{+0.10}_{-0.09}
10^{15}M_{\odot}$. We show this is in excellent agreement with Lambda cold-dark-matter (LCDM)
predictions when the CLASH X-ray selection function and projection effects are taken into account.
The best-fit Einasto shape parameter is $\alpha_E=0.191^{+0.071}_{-0.068}$, which is consistent
with the NFW-equivalent Einasto parameter of $\sim 0.18$. We reconstruct projected mass density
profiles of all CLASH clusters from a joint likelihood analysis of shear-and-magnification data,
and measure cluster masses at several characteristic radii. We also derive an ensemble-averaged
total projected mass profile of the X-ray-selected subsample by stacking their individual mass
profiles. The stacked total mass profile, constrained by the shear+magnification data, is shown
to be consistent with our shear-based halo-model predictions including the effects of surrounding
large-scale structure as a two-halo term, establishing further consistency in the context of the
LCDM model.
