The collapsar model was proposed to explain the long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), while the
short GRBs are associated with the mergers of compact objects. In the first case, mainly the energetics
of the events is consistent with the proposed progenitor models, while the duration, time variability,
as well as the afterglow emission may shed some light on the detailed properties of the collapsing
massive stars. In the latter case, the recent discovery of the binary neutron star (NS-NS) merger
in the gravitational wave observation made by LIGO (GW170817), and the detection of associated
electromagnetic counterparts, for the first time gave a direct proof of the NS-NS merger being a
progenitor of a short GRB. In general, all GRBs are believed to be powered by accretion through a rotationally
supported torus, or by fast rotation of a compact object. For long ones, the rotation of the progenitor
star is a key property in order to support accretion over relatively long activity periods, and also
to sustain the rotation of the black hole itself. The latter is responsible for ejection of the relativistic
jets, which are powered due to the extraction of the BH rotational energy, mitigated by the accretion
torus and magnetic fields. The jets must break through the stellar envelope though, which poses
a question on the efficiency of this process. Similar mechanisms of powering the jet ejection may
act in short GRBs, which in this case may freely propagate through the interstellar medium. The power
of the jets launched from the rotating black hole is at first associated mostly with the magnetic
Poynting flux, and then at large distances it is transferred to the kinetic and finally radiative
energy of the expanding shells.
