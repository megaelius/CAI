We present the first spectroscopic confirmation of an ultra-massive galaxy at redshift z>3
using data from Keck-NIRSPEC, VLT-Xshooter, and GTC-Osiris. We detect strong [OIII] and Ly$\alpha$
emission, and weak [OII], CIV, and HeII, placing C1-23152 at a spectroscopic redshift of $z_{spec}$=3.351.
The modeling of the emission-line corrected spectral energy distribution results in a best-fit
stellar mass of $M_{*}=3.1^{+0.6}_{-0.7}\times10^{11} M_{\odot}$, a star-formation rate of
<7 $M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$, and negligible dust extinction. The stars appear to have formed in a
short intense burst ~300-500 Myr prior to the observation epoch, setting the formation redshift
of this galaxy at z~4.1. From the analysis of the line ratios and widths, and the observed flux at 24$\mu$m,
we confirm the presence of a luminous hidden active galactic nucleus (AGN), with bolometric luminosity
of ~$10^{46}erg s^{-1}$. Potential contamination to the observed SED from the AGN continuum is
constrained, placing a lower limit on the stellar mass of $2\times10^{11} M_{\odot}$. HST/WFC3
$H_{160}$ and ACS $I_{814}$ images are modeled, resulting in an effective radius of $r_{e}$~1 kpc
in the $H_{160}$ band and a Sersic index n~4.4. This object may be a prototype of the progenitors of
local most massive elliptical galaxies in the first 2 Gyr of cosmic history, having formed most of
its stars at z>4 in a highly dissipative, intense, and short burst of star formation. C1-23152
is completing its transition to a post-starburst phase while hosting a powerful AGN, potentially
responsible for the quenching of the star formation activity.
