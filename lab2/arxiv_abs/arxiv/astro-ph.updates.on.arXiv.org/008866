GEMS is an IRAM 30m Large Program whose aim is determining the elemental depletions and the ionization
fraction in a set of prototypical star-forming regions. This paper presents the first results from
the prototypical dark cloud TMC 1. Extensive millimeter observations have been carried out with
the IRAM 30m telescope (3mm and 2mm) and the 40m Yebes telescope (1.3cm and 7mm) to determine the fractional
abundances of CO, HCO+, HCN, CS, SO, HCS+, and N2H+ in three cuts which intersect the dense filament
at the well-known positions TMC 1-CP, TMC 1-NH3, and TMC 1-C, covering a visual extinction range
from Av~3 to ~20mag. Two phases with differentiated chemistry can be distinguished: i) the translucent
envelope with molecular hydrogen densities of (1-5)x10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$; and ii) the dense phase,
located at Av>10mag, with molecular hydrogen densities >10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$. Observations and modeling
show that the gas phase abundances of C and O progressively decrease along the C+/C/CO transition
zone where C/H~8x10$^{-5}$ and C/O~0.8-1, until the beginning of the dense phase at Av~10 mag. This
is consistent with the grain temperatures being below the CO evaporation temperature in this region.
In the case of sulfur, a strong depletion should occur before the translucent phase where we estimate
a S/H~(0.4 - 2.2) x10$^{-6}$, an abundance ~7-40 times lower than the solar value. A second strong
depletion must be present during the formation of the thick icy mantles to achieve the values of S/H
measured in the dense cold cores (S/H~8x10$^{-8}$). Based on our chemical modeling, we constrain
the value of $\zeta_{\rm H_2}$ to ~(0.5 - 1.8) x10$^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$ in the translucent cloud.
