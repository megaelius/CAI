We measure the bivariate luminosity function (BLF) of galaxy pairs and use it to probe and characterize
the galaxy-galaxy interaction between pair members. The galaxy pair sample is selected from the
main galaxy sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey and supplied with a significant number of redshifts
from the LAMOST spectral and GAMA surveys. We find the BLFs depend on the projected distance $d_{\text{p}}$
between pair members. At large separation $d_{\text{p}} > 150 h^{-1}\ \text{kpc}$, the BLF degenerates
into a luminosity function (LF) of single galaxies, indicating few interactions between pair members.
At $100 h^{-1}\ \text{kpc} \leq d_{\text{p}} \leq 150 h^{-1}\ \text{kpc}$, the BLF starts to show
the correlation between pair members, in the sense that the shape of the conditional luminosity
function (CLF) of one member galaxy starts to depend on the luminosity of the other member galaxy.
Specifically, the CLF with a brighter companion has a steeper faint-end slope, which becomes even
more significant at $50 h^{-1}\ \text{kpc} \leq d_{\text{p}} \leq 100 h^{-1}\ \text{kpc}$. This
behavior is consistent with the scenario, \textit{and also is the observational evidence}, that
dynamic friction drives massive major merger pairs to merge more quickly. At close distance $d_{\text{p}}
\leq 50 h^{-1}\ \text{kpc}$, besides the merging time-scale effect, the BLF also shows an overall
brightening of $\Delta M_r \geq 0.04$ mag, which reveals the enhanced star formation of the close-pair
phase. By combining another statistical conclusion that the star formation rate of late-type galaxies
in close pairs is enhanced at a level of about 40\%, we further conclude that the average starburst
time-scale of close pairs is as long as 0.4 Gyr.
