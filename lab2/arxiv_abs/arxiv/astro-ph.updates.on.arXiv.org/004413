Hydrostatic equilibrium (HSE), where the thermal pressure gradient balances the force of gravity,
is tested across a range of simulated EAGLE haloes from Milky Way L* haloes (M_200~10^12 Msol) to
cluster scales. Clusters (M_200>=10^14 Msol) reproduce previous results with thermal pressure
responsible for ~90% of the support against gravity, but this fraction drops for group-sized haloes
(M_200~10^13 Msol) and is even lower (40-70%) for L* haloes between 0.1-0.3 R_200. Energy from feedback
grows relative to the binding energy of a halo toward lower mass resulting in greater deviations
from HSE. Tangential motions comprise the largest deviation from HSE in L* haloes indicating that
the hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) has significant sub- centrifugal rotation and angular momentum
spin parameters 2-3x higher than the dark matter spin parameters. Thermal feedback can buoyantly
rise to the outer CGM of M_200<10^12 Msol haloes, both moving baryons beyond R_200 and feeding uncorrelated
tangential motions. The resulting hot halo density and rotation profiles show promising agreement
with X-ray observations of the inner Milky Way halo, and we discuss future observational prospects
to detect spinning hot haloes around other galaxies. Acceleration and radial streaming motions
also comprise significant deviations from HSE, especially net outward accelerations seen in L*
and group haloes indicating active feedback. Black hole feedback acts in a preventative manner
during the later growth of group haloes, applying significant accelerations via shocks that do
not feed tangential motions. We argue that HSE is a poor assumption for the CGM, especially in the
inner regions, and rotating baryonic hot haloes are a critical consideration for analytic models
of the CGM.
