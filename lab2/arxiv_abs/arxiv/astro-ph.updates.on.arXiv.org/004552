Methanol is formed via surface reactions on icy dust grains. Methanol is also detected in the gas-phase
at temperatures below its thermal desorption temperature and at levels higher than can be explained
by pure gas-phase chemistry. The process that controls the transition from solid state to gas-phase
methanol in cold environments is not understood. The goal of this work is to investigate whether
thermal CO desorption provides an indirect pathway for methanol to co-desorb at low temperatures.
Mixed CH$_{3}$OH:CO/CH$_{4}$ ices were heated under UHV (ultra-high vacuum) conditions and ice
contents are traced using RAIRS (reflection absorption IR spectroscopy), while desorbing species
were detected mass spectrometrically. An updated gas-grain chemical network was used to test the
impact of the results of these experiments. The physical model used is applicable for TW Hya, a protoplanetary
disk in which cold gas-phase methanol has recently been detected. Methanol release together with
thermal CO desorption is found to be an ineffective process in the experiments, resulting in an upper
limit of $\leq$ 7.3 $\times$ 10$^{-7}$ CH3OH molecules per CO molecule over all ice mixtures considered.
Chemical modelling based on the upper limits shows that co-desorption rates as low as 10$^{-6}$
CH$_{3}$OH molecules per CO molecule are high enough to release substantial amounts of methanol
to the gas-phase at and around the location of the CO thermal desorption front in a protoplanetary
disk. The impact of thermal co-desorption of CH3OH with CO as a grain-gas bridge mechanism is compared
with that of UV induced photodesorption and chemisorption.
