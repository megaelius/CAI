We study the geometric and physical foundations of Finsler gravity theories with metric compatible
connections defined on tangent bundles, or (pseudo) Riemannian manifolds). There are analyzed
alternatives to Einstein gravity (including theories with broken local Lorentz invariance) and
shown how general relativity and modifications can be equivalently re-formulated in Finsler like
variables. We focus on prospects in modern cosmology and Finsler acceleration of Universe. All
known formalisms are outlined - anholonomic frames with associated nonlinear connection structure,
the geometry of the Levi-Civita and Finsler type connections, all defined by the same metric structure,
Einstein equations in standard form and/or with nonholonomic/ Finsler variables - and the following
topics are discussed: motivation for Finsler gravity; generalized principles of equivalence
and covariance; fundamental geometric/ physical structures; field equations and nonholonomic
constraints; equivalence with other models of gravity and viability criteria. Einstein-Finsler
gravity theories are elaborated following almost the same principles as in the general relativity
theory but extended to Finsler metrics and connections. Gravity models with anisotropy can be defined
on (co) tangent bundles or on nonholonomic pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. In the second case, Finsler
geometries can be modelled as exact solutions in Einstein gravity. Finally, some examples of generic
off-diagonal metrics and generalized connections, defining anisotropic cosmological Einstein-Finsler
spaces are analyzed; certain criteria for Finsler accelerating evolution are analyzed.
