Binaries in double-lined spectroscopic systems provide a homogeneous set of stars. Differences
of parameters, such as age or initial conditions, which otherwise would have strong impact on the
stellar evolution, can be neglected. The observed differences are determined by the difference
in stellar mass between the two components. The mass ratio can be determined with much higher accuracy
than the actual stellar mass. In this work, we aim to study the eccentric binary system KIC9163796,
whose two components are very close in mass and both are low-luminosity red-giant stars from four
years of Kepler space photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy with Hermes. Mass and radius
of the primary were determined through asteroseismology to be 1.39+/-0.06 Mo and 5.35+/-0.09 Ro,
resp. From spectral disentangling the mass ratio was found to be 1.015+/-0.005 and that the secondary
is ~600K hotter than the primary. Evolutionary models place both components, in the early and advanced
stage of the first dredge-up event on the red-giant branch. From theoretical models of the primary,
we derived the internal rotational gradient. From a grid of models, the measured difference in lithium
abundance is compared with theoretical predictions. The surface rotation of the primary is determined
from the Kepler light curve and resembles the orbital period within 10 days. The radial rotational
gradient between the surface and core is found to be 6.9+2.0/-1.0. The agreement between the surface
rotation with the seismic result indicates that the full convective envelope is rotating quasi-rigidly.
The models of the lithium abundance are compatible with a rigid rotation in the radiative zone during
the main sequence. Because of the many constraints offered by oscillating stars in binary systems,
such objects are important test beds of stellar evolution.
