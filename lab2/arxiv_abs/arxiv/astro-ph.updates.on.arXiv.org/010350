This paper constraints dynamic dark energy equation of state (EoS) parameters using the type Ia
supernovae from Union 2.1 dataset. The paper also discusses the dependency of dynamic dark energy
EoS parameters on the chosen or assumed value of the Hubble Constant. To understand the correlation
between the Hubble Constant values and measured dynamic dark energy EoS parameters, we used recent
surveys being done through various techniques such as cosmic microwave background studies, gravitational
waves, baryonic acoustic oscillations and standard candles to set values for different Hubble
Constant values as fixed parameters with CPL and WCDM models. Then we applied trust region reflective
(TRF) and dog leg (dogbox) algorithms to fit dark energy density parameter and dynamic dark energy
EoS parameters. We found a significant negative correlation between the fixed Hubble Constant
parameter and measured EoS parameter, w0. Then we used two best fit Hubble Constant values (70 and
69.18474) km $s^{-1}$ $Mpc^{-1}$ based on Chi-square test to test more dark energy EoS parameters
like: JBP, BA, PADE-I, PADE-II, and LH4 models and compared the results with $\Lambda$-CDM with
constant $w_{de}$=-1, WCDM and CPL models. We conclude that flat $\Lambda$-CDM and WCDM models
clearly provide best results while using the BIC criteria as it severely penalizes the use of extra
parameters. However, the dependency of EoS parameters on Hubble Constant value and the increasing
tension in the measurement of Hubble Constant values using different techniques warrants further
investigation into looking for optimal dynamic dark energy EoS models to optimally model the relation
between the expansion rate and evolution of dark energy in our universe.
