We present a sample of 33 Balmer Break Galaxies (BBGs) selected as dropouts in the deepest HST/F160W
images of the two CANDELS/GOODS fields (i.e., $H\gtrsim27.3$ mag) but relatively bright in Spitzer/IRAC
($[3.6],[4.5]<24.5$ mag). Half of these BBGs are newly identified. BBGs are, on average, massive
($\langle \log(\rm{M}/\rm{M}_\odot) \rangle=10.7^{10.9}_{10.3}$) high redshift ($\langle
z\rangle=4.8^{5.1}_{4.4}$) galaxies with red colors ($\langle H-[3.6]\rangle= 3.3^{3.9}_{2.6}$
mag) and relatively high dust obscurations ($\langle \rm{A(V)}\rangle=1.9^{2.0}_{1.4}$ mag).
The SEDs of the bulk of the sample (65%) indicate the presence of prominent optical emission lines
boosting the IRAC fluxes and contributing to the red colors. Approximately 20% of the BBGs are very
dusty ($\rm{A(V)}\sim2.5$ mag) starbursts with strong mid-to-far infrared detections and extreme
star formation rates ($\rm{SFR}>10^{3}\,\rm{M}_\odot/yr$). The rest of BBGs, 15%, shows slightly
suppressed SFRs and mass-weighted ages older than 500 Myr, which indicates that they are either
post-starbursts or quiescent galaxies. Only 2 galaxies are X-ray detected AGN, but we cannot discard
the presence of obscured AGN in the rest of sources. Our sample of BBGs accounts for 7% of the total
number density of $\log(\rm{M}/\rm{M}_\odot) >10$ galaxies at $z>3$, but it is a significant contributor
(30%) to the general population of $\log(\rm{M}/\rm{M}_\odot)>11$ galaxies at $4<z<6$ and, more
remarkably, to the population of red massive galaxies in the same redshift interval, accounting
for 35% of this population. Finally, our results point out that one of every ten massive $\log(\rm{M}/\rm{M}_\odot)>11$
galaxies in the local Universe was assembled in the first 1.5 Gyr after the Big Bang.
