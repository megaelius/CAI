The High-Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS) has detected diffuse TeV emission correlated with
the distribution of molecular gas along the Galactic Ridge at the Galactic Center. Diffuse, non-thermal
emission is also seen by the Fermi large area telescope (Fermi-LAT) in the GeV range and by radio telescopes
in the GHz range. Additionally, there is a distinct, spherically symmetric excess of gamma rays
seen by Fermi-LAT in the GeV range. A cosmic ray flare, occurring in the Galactic Center, $10^4$ years
ago has been proposed to explain the TeV Galactic Ridge (Aharonian et al. 2006). An alternative,
steady-state model explaining all three data sets (TeV, GeV, and radio) invokes purely leptonic
processes (Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2013). We show that the flare model from the Galactic Center also provides
an acceptable fit to the GeV and radio data, provided the diffusion coefficient is energy independent.
However, if Kolmogorov-type turbulence is assumed for the diffusion coefficient, we find that
two flares are needed, one for the TeV data (occurring approximately $ 10^4 $ years ago) and an older
one for the GeV data (approximately $10^5$ years old). We find that the flare models we investigate
do not fit the spherically symmetric GeV excess as well as the usual generalized Navarro-Frenk-White
spatial profile, but are better suited to explaining the Galactic Ridge. We also show that predominantly
hadronic steady-state models are able to explain all three data sets. Additionally, we investigate
how the flare and steady-state models may be distinguished with future gamma-ray data looking for
a spatial dependence of the gamma-ray spectral index.
