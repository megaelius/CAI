The existence of $\approx$10^9 Msun supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the first billion
year of the universe has stimulated numerous ideas for the prompt formation and rapid growth of BHs
in the early universe. Here we review ways in which the seeds of massive BHs may have first assembled,
how they may have subsequently grown as massive as $\approx$10^9 Msun, and how multi-messenger
observations could distinguish between different SMBH assembly scenarios. We conclude the following:
(1) The ultra-rare $\approx$10^9 Msun SMBHs represent only the tip of the iceberg. Early BHs likely
fill a continuum from stellar-mass (approx. 10 Msun) to the super-massive ($\approx$10^9 Msun)
regime, reflecting a range of initial masses and growth histories. (2) Stellar-mass BHs were likely
left behind by the first generation of stars at redshifts as high as z=30, but their initial growth
was typically stunted due to the shallow potential wells of their host galaxies. (3) Conditions
in some larger, metal-poor galaxies soon became conducive to the rapid formation and growth of massive
`seed' holes, via gas accretion and by mergers in dense stellar clusters. (4) BH masses depend on
the environment (such as the number and properties of nearby radiation sources and the local baryonic
streaming velocity), and on the metal enrichment and assembly history of the host galaxy. (5) Distinguishing
between assembly mechanisms will be difficult, but a combination of observations by LISA (probing
massive BH growth via mergers) and by deep multi-wavelength electromagnetic observations (probing
growth via gas accretion) is particularly promising.
