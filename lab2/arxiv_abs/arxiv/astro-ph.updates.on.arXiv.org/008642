Recent Juno observations have suggested that the heavy elements in Jupiter could be diluted throughout
a large fraction of its gaseous envelope, providing a stabilising compositional gradient over
an extended region of the planet. This could trigger layered semi-convection, which, in the context
of giant planets more generally, may explain Saturn's luminosity excess and play a role in causing
the abnormally large radii of some hot Jupiters. In giant planet interiors, it could take the form
of density staircases, which are convective layers separated by thin stably stratified interfaces.
In addition, the efficiency of tidal dissipation is known to depend strongly on the planetary internal
structure. We aim to study the resulting tidal dissipation when internal waves are excited in a region
of layered semi-convection by tidal gravitational forcing due to other bodies (such as moons in
giant planet systems, or stars in hot Jupiter systems). We adopt a local Cartesian model with a background
layered density profile subjected to an imposed tidal forcing, and we compute the viscous and thermal
dissipation rates numerically. We find that the rates of tidal dissipation can be enhanced in a region
of layered semi-convection compared to a uniformly convective medium, where the latter corresponds
with the usual assumption adopted in giant planet interior models. In particular, a region of layered
semi-convection possesses a richer set of resonances, allowing enhanced dissipation for a wider
range of tidal frequencies. The details of these results significantly depend on the structural
properties of the layered semi-convective regions. Layered semi-convection could contribute
towards explaining the high tidal dissipation rates observed in Jupiter and Saturn, which have
not yet been fully explained by theory. Further work is required to explore the efficiency of this
mechanism in global models.
