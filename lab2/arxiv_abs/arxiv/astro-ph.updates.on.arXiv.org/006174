The Hapke model has been widely used to describe the photometrical behavior of planetary surface
through the Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), but the uncertainties
about retrieved parameters has been difficult to handle so far. A recent study proposed to estimate
the uncertainties using a Bayesian approach (Schmidt et al., Icarus 2015). In the present article,
we first propose an improved numerical implementation to speed up the uncertainties estimation.
Then, we conduct two synthetic studies about photometric measurements in order to analyze the influence
of observation geometry: First, we introduce the concept of "efficiency" of a set of geometries
to sample the photometric behavior. A set of angular sampling elements (noted as geometry) is efficient
if the retrieved Hapke parameters are close to the expected ones. We compared different geometries
and found that the principal plane with high incidence is the most efficient geometry among the tested
ones. In particular, such geometries are better than poorly sampled full BRDF. Second, we test the
analysis scheme of a collection of photometric data acquired from various locations in order to
answer the question: are these locations photometrically homogeneous or not? For instance, this
question arises when combining data from an entire planetary body, where each spatial position
is sampled at a single geometry. We tested the ability of the Bayesian method to decipher two situations,
in the presence of noise: (i) a photometrically homogeneous surface (all observations with the
same photometric behavior), or (ii) an heterogeneous surface with two distinct photometrical
properties (half observations with photometric behavior 1, other half with photometric behavior
2). We show that the naive interpretation of the results provided by Bayesian method is not able to
solve this problem.
