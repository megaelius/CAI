We consider the standard problem of observational astronomy, i.e. the observations of light emission
from a distant region of spacetime in general relativity. The goal is to describe the changes between
the measurements of the light performed by a sample of observers slightly displaced with respect
to each other and moving with different 4-velocities and 4-accelerations. In our approach, all
results of observations can be expressed as functions of the kinematic variables, describing the
motions of the observers and the emitting bodies with respect to their local inertial frames, and
four linear bilocal geodesic operators, describing the influence of the spacetime geometry on
light propagation. The operators are functionals of the curvature tensor along the line of sight.
The results are based on the assumption that the regions of emissions and observations are sufficiently
small so that the spacetime curvature effects are negligible within each of them, although they
are significant for the light propagation between them. The new formulation provides a uniform
approach to optical phenomena in curved spacetimes and, as an application, we discuss the problem
of a fully relativistic definition of the parallax and position drifts (or proper motions). We then
use the results to construct combinations of observables which are completely insensitive to the
motion of both the observer and the emitter. These combinations by construction probe the spacetime
geometry between the observation and emission regions and in our formalism we may express them as
functionals of the Riemann tensor along the line of sight. For short distances one of these combinations
depends only on the matter content along the line of sight. This opens up the possibility to measure
the matter content of a spacetime in a tomography-like manner irrespective of the peculiar motions
of the emitter and the observer.
