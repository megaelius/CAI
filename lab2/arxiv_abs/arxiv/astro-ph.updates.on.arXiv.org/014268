In contrast to massless spinning particles, scalars are not heavily constrained by unitarity and
locality. Off-shell, no gauge symmetries are required to write down manifestly local theories,
while on-shell consistent factorisation is trivial. Instead a useful classification scheme for
scalars is based on the symmetries they can non-linearly realise. Motivated by the breaking of Lorentz
boosts in cosmology, in this paper we classify the possible symmetries of a shift-symmetric scalar
that is assumed to non-linearly realise Lorentz boosts as, for example, in the EFT of inflation.
Our classification method is algebraic; guided by the coset construction and inverse Higgs constraints.
We rediscover some known phonon theories within the superfluid and galileid classes, and discover
a new galileid theory which we call the $\textit{extended galileid}$. Generic galileids correspond
to the broken phase of galileon scalar EFTs and our extended galileids correspond to special subsets
where each galileon coupling is fixed by an additional symmetry. We discuss the broken phase of theories
that also admit a perturbation theory around Poincar\'{e} invariant vacua and we show that the so-called
exceptional EFTs, the DBI scalar and special galileon, do not admit such a broken phase. Concentrating
on DBI we provide a detailed account of this showing that the scattering amplitudes are secretly
Poincar\'{e} invariant when the theory is expanded around the superfluid background used in the
EFT of inflation. We point out that DBI is an exception to the common lore that the residue of the total
energy pole of cosmological correlators is proportional to the amplitude. We also discuss the inevitability
of poles in $2 \rightarrow 2$ scattering amplitudes when boost are spontaneously broken meaning
that such theories do not admit Adler zeros and generalisations even in the presence of a shift symmetry.
