As we begin to discover rocky planets in the habitable zone of nearby stars with missions like TESS
and CHEOPS, we will need quick advancements on instrumentation and observational techniques that
will enable us to answer key science questions, such as What are the atmospheric characteristics
of habitable zone rocky planets? How common are Earth-like biosignatures in rocky planets?} How
similar or dissimilar are those planets to Earth? Over the next decade we expect to have discovered
several Earth-analog candidates, but we will not have the tools to study the atmospheres of all of
them in detail. Ground-based ELTs can identify biosignatures in the spectra of these candidate
exo-Earths and understand how the planets' atmospheres compare to the Earth at different epochs.
Transit spectroscopy, high-resolution spectroscopy, and reflected-light direct imaging on
ELTs can identify multiple biosignatures for habitable zone, rocky planets around M stars at optical
to near-infrared wavelengths. Thermal infrared direct imaging can detect habitable zone, rocky
planets around AFGK stars, identifying ozone and motivating reflected-light follow-up observations
with NASA missions like HabEx/LUVOIR. Therefore, we recommend that the Astro2020 Decadal Survey
Committee support: (1) the search for Earth-like biosignatures on rocky planets around nearby
stars as a key science case; (2) the construction over the next decade of ground-based Extremely
Large Telecopes (ELTs), which will provide the large aperture and spatial resolution necessary
to start revealing the atmospheres of Earth-analogues around nearby stars; (3) the development
of instrumentation that optimizes the detection of biosignatures; and (4) the generation of accurate
line lists for potential biosignature gases, which are needed as model templates to detect those
molecules.
