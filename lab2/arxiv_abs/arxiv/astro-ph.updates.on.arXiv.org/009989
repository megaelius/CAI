We investigate the scattering of strahl electrons by micro-instabilities as a mechanism for creating
the electron halo in the solar wind. We develop a mathematical framework for the description of electron-driven
micro-instabilities and discuss the associated physical mechanisms. We find that an instability
of the oblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler (FM/W) mode is the best candidate for a micro-instability
that scatters strahl electrons into the halo. We derive approximate analytical expressions for
its instability threshold and confirm their accuracy through comparison with numerical solutions
to the hot-plasma dispersion relation. We find that the strahl-driven oblique FM/W instability
creates copious FM/W waves under low-$\beta_{\mathrm c}$ conditions when $U_{0\mathrm s}\gtrsim
3w_{\mathrm c}$, where $\beta_{\mathrm c}$ is the ratio of the core electrons' thermal pressure
to the magnetic pressure, $U_{0\mathrm s}$ is the strahl speed, and $w_{\mathrm c}$ is the thermal
speed of the core. These waves have a propagation angle of about $60^{\circ}$ with respect to the
background magnetic field and a frequency of about half the local electron gyro-frequency. We also
derive an analytical expression for the strahl-driven oblique FM/W instability for $\beta_{\mathrm
c}$ values approaching unity. The comparison of our theory results with data from the \emph{Wind}
spacecraft confirms the relevance of the oblique FM/W instability for the solar wind. We show that
the whistler heat-flux, ion-acoustic heat-flux, kinetic-Alfv\'en-wave heat-flux, and electrostatic
electron-beam instabilities cannot fulfill the requirements for self-induced scattering of
strahl electrons into the halo. We make predictions for the electron strahl close to the Sun, which
will be testable against measurements from \emph{Parker Solar Probe} and \emph{Solar Orbiter}.
