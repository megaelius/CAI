Recent results obtained with gamma-ray satellites have established supernova remnants as accelerators
of GeV hadronic cosmic rays. In such processes, CRs accelerated in SNR shocks interact with particles
from gas clouds in their surrounding. In particular, the rich medium in which core-collapse SNRs
explode provides a large target density to boost hadronic gamma-rays. SNR G39.2-0.3 is one of the
brightest SNR in infrared wavelengths, and its broad multi-wavelength coverage allows detailed
modeling of its radiation from radio to high energies. We reanalyzed the Fermi-LAT data on this region
and compare it with new radio observations from the MWISP survey. The modeling of the spectral energy
distribution from radio to GeV energies favors an hadronic origin of the gamma-ray emission and
constrains the SNR magnetic field to be at least ~100 uG. Despite the large magnetic field, the present
acceleration of protons seems to be limited to ~10 GeV, which points to a drastic slow down of the shock
velocity due to the dense wall traced by the CO observations, surrounding the remnant. Further investigation
of the gamma-ray spectral shape points to a dynamically old remnant subjected to severe escape of
CRs and a decrease of acceleration efficiency. The low-energy peak of the gamma-ray spectrum also
suggests that that the composition of accelerated particles might be enriched by heavy nuclei which
is certainly expected for a core-collapse SNR. Alternatively, the contribution of the compressed
pre-existing Galactic cosmic rays is discussed, which is, however, found to not likely be the dominant
process for gamma-ray production.
