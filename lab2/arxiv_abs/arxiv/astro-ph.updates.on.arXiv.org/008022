The Disk Substructures at High Angular Resolution Project (DSHARP) provides a large sample of protoplanetary
disks having substructures which could be induced by young forming planets. To explore the properties
of planets that may be responsible for these substructures, we systematically carry out a grid of
2-D hydrodynamical simulations including both gas and dust components. We present the resulting
gas structures, including the relationship between the planet mass and 1) the gaseous gap depth/width,
and 2) the sub/super-Keplerian motion across the gap. We then compute dust continuum intensity
maps at the frequency of the DSHARP observations. We provide the relationship between the planet
mass and 1) the depth/width of the gaps at millimeter intensity maps, 2) the gap edge ellipticity
and asymmetry, and 3) the position of secondary gaps induced by the planet. With these relationships,
we lay out the procedure to constrain the planet mass using gap properties, and study the potential
planets in the DSHARP disks. We highlight the excellent agreement between observations and simulations
for AS 209 and the detectability of the young Solar System analog. Finally, under the assumption
that the detected gaps are induced by young planets, we characterize the young planet population
in the planet mass-semimajor axis diagram. We find that the occurrence rate for $>$ 5 $M_J$ planets
beyond 5-10 au is consistent with direct imaging constraints. Disk substructures allow us probe
a wide-orbit planet population (Neptune to Jupiter mass planets beyond 10 au) that is not accessible
to other planet searching techniques.
