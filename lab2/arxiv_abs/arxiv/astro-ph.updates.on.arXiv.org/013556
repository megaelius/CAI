Growing protoplanets experience a number of impacts during the accretion stage. A large impactor
hits the surface of a protoplanet and produces a magma ocean, where the impactor's iron emulsifies
and experiences metal-silicate equilibration with the mantle of the protoplanet while it descends
towards the base of the magma ocean. This process repeatedly occurs and determines the chemical
compositions of both mantle and core. The partitioning is controlled by parameters such as the equilibration
pressure and temperature, which are often associated with or assumed to be proportional to the pressure
and temperature at the base of the magma ocean. The pressure and temperature depend on both the depth
and shape of a magma ocean because a spatially confined magma ocean, namely, a melt pool, can have
a larger equilibrium pressure than a radially uniform (global) magma ocean even if their melt volumes
are the same. Here, we develop scaling laws for (1) the total internal energy gain due to an impact,
and (2) the heat distribution within the mantle based on more than 100 smoothed particle hydrodynamic
(SPH) simulations. We use Legendre polynomials to describe these scaling laws and determine their
coefficients by linear regression, minimizing the error between our model and SPH simulations.
The input parameters are the impact angle, total mass, impact velocity, and impactor-to-total
mass ratio. We find that the internal energy gain by a large impact is well characterized by the summation
of the kinetic energy and accretional potential energy release as a function of the impact angle.
We determine that the equilibrium pressure at the base of a melt pool can be higher (by $10-50 \%$)
than those obtained from conventional radially-uniform global magma ocean models. These melt
scaling laws are publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/mikinakajima/MeltScalingLaw).
