We perform a stacking analysis of {\it Planck}, {\it AKARI}, Infrared Astronomical Satellite ($IRAS$),
Wide-field Infrared Survey Eplorer ($WISE$), and {\it Herschel} images of the largest number of
(candidate) protoclusters at $z\sim3.8$ selected from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic
Program (HSC-SSP). Stacking the images of the $179$ candidate protoclusters, the combined infrared
(IR) emission of the protocluster galaxies in the observed $12-850~\mu$m wavelength range is successfully
detected with $>5\sigma$ significance (at $Planck$). This is the first time that the average IR
spectral energy distribution (SED) of a protocluster has been constrained at $z\sim4$. The observed
IR SEDs of the protoclusters exhibit significant excess emission in the mid-IR compared to that
expected from typical star-forming galaxies (SFGs). They are reproduced well using SED models
of intense starburst galaxies with warm/hot dust heated by young stars, or by a population of active
galactic nuclei (AGN)/SFG composites. For the pure star-forming model, a total IR (from 8 to 1000
$\mu$m) luminosity of $19.3_{-4.2}^{+0.6}\times10^{13}~L_{\odot}$ and a star formation rate
(SFR) of $16.3_{-7.8}^{+1.0}\times10^3~M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ are found whereas for the AGN/SFG
composite model, $5.1_{-2.5}^{+2.5}\times10^{13}~L_{\odot}$ and $2.1^{+6.3}_{-1.7}\times10^3~M_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$ are found. Uncertainty remaining in the total SFRs; however, the IR luminosities of the
most massive protoclusters are likely to continue increasing up to $z\sim4$. Meanwhile, no significant
IR flux excess is observed around optically selected QSOs at similar redshifts, which confirms
previous results. Our results suggest that the $z\sim4$ protoclusters trace dense, intensely
star-forming environments that may also host obscured AGNs missed by the selection in the optical.
