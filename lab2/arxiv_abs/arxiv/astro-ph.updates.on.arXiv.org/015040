M16, the Eagle Nebula, is an outstanding \HII \ region which exhibits extensive high-mass star formation
and hosts remarkable "pillars". We herein obtained new $^{12}$CO $J=$1-0 data for the region observed
with NANTEN2, which were combined with the $^{12}$CO $J=$1-0 data obtained using FUGIN survey.
These observations revealed that a giant molecular cloud (GMC) of $\sim 1.3 \times 10^5$ \Msun \
is associated with M16, which is elongated by over 30 pc and is perpendicular to the galactic plane,
at a distance of 1.8 kpc. This GMC can be divided into the northern (N) cloud, the eastern (E) filament,
the southeast (SE) cloud, the southeast (SE) filament, and the southern (S) cloud. We also found
two velocity components (blue and red shifted component) in the N cloud. The blue-shifted component
shows a ring-like structure, as well as the red-shifted component coincides with the intensity
depression of the ring-like structure. The position-velocity diagram of the components showed
a V-shaped velocity feature. The spatial and velocity structures of the cloud indicated that two
different velocity components collided with each other at a relative velocity of 11.6 \kms. The
timescale of the collision was estimated to be $\sim 4 \times 10^5$ yr. The collision event reasonably
explains the formation of the O9V star ALS15348, as well as the shape of the Spitzer bubble N19. A similar
velocity structure was found in the SE cloud, which is associated with the O7.5V star HD168504. In
addition, the complementary distributions of the two velocity components found in the entire GMC
suggested that the collision event occurred globally. On the basis of the above results, we herein
propose a hypothesis that the collision between the two components occurred sequentially over
the last several $10^{6}$ yr and triggered the formation of O-type stars in the NGC6611 cluster.
