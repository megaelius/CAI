Aims: We explore the capabilities of CARMENES for characterizing hot-Jupiter atmospheres by targeting
multiple water bands, in particular, those at 1.15 and 1.4 $\mu$m. Hubble Space Telescope observations
suggest that this wavelength region is relevant for distinguishing between hazy/cloudy and clear
atmospheres. Methods: We observed one transit of the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b with CARMENES. Telluric
and stellar absorption lines were removed using Sysrem, which performs a principal component analysis
including proper error propagation. The residual spectra were analysed for water absorption with
cross-correlation techniques using synthetic atmospheric absorption models. Results: We report
a cross-correlation peak at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 6.6, revealing the presence of water
in the transmission spectrum of HD 189733 b. The absorption signal appeared slightly blueshifted
at -3.9 $\pm$ 1.3 kms$^{-1}$. We measured the individual cross-correlation signals of the water
bands at 1.15 and 1.4 $\mu$m, finding cross-correlation peaks at SNRs of 4.9 and 4.4, respectively.
The 1.4 $\mu$m feature is consistent with that observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Conclusions:
The water bands studied in this work have been mainly observed in a handful of planets from space.
The ability of also detecting them individually from the ground at higher spectral resolution can
provide insightful information to constrain the properties of exoplanet atmospheres. Although
the current multiband detections can not yet constrain atmospheric haze models for HD 189733 b,
future observations at higher signal-to-noise ratio could provide an alternative way to achieve
this aim.
