The hot plasma in galaxy clusters is expected to be heated to high temperatures through shocks and
adiabatic compression. The thermodynamical properties of the gas encode information on the processes
leading to the thermalization of the gas in the cluster's potential well as well as non-gravitational
processes such as gas cooling, AGN feedback and kinetic energy. In this work we present the radial
profiles of the thermodynamic properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) out to the virial radius
for a sample of 12 galaxy clusters selected from the Planck all-sky survey. We determine the universal
profiles of gas density, temperature, pressure, and entropy over more than two decades in radius.
We exploit jointly X-ray information from XMM and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich constraints from Planck
to recover thermodynamic properties out to 2 R500. We provide average functional forms for the radial
dependence of the main quantities and quantify the slope and intrinsic scatter of the population
as a function of radius. We find that gas density and pressure profiles steepen steadily with radius,
in excellent agreement with previous observational results. Entropy profiles beyond R500 closely
follow the predictions for the gravitational collapse of structures. The scatter in all thermodynamical
quantities reaches a minimum in the range [0.2-0.8] R500 and increases outwards. Somewhat surprisingly,
we find that pressure is substantially more scattered than temperature and density. Our results
indicate that once accreting substructures are properly excised, the properties of the ICM beyond
the cooling region R > 0.3 R500) follow remarkably well the predictions of simple gravitational
collapse and require little non-gravitational corrections.
