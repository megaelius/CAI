The CO(J=3-2) emission from the CSE of the binary S-type AGB star W Aql has been observed at subarcsecond
resolution using ALMA. The aim of this paper is to investigate the wind properties of the AGB star
and to analyse how the known companion has shaped the CSE. The average mass-loss rate during the creation
of the detected CSE is estimated through modelling, using the ALMA brightness distribution and
previously published single-dish measurements as observational constraints. The ALMA observations
are presented and compared to the results from a 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) binary
interaction model with the same properties as the W Aql system and with two different orbital eccentricities.
Three-dimensional radiative transfer modelling is performed and the response of the interferometer
is modelled and discussed. The estimated average mass-loss rate of W~Aql agrees with previous results.
The size of the emitting region is consistent with photodissociation models. The CO(J=3-2) emission
is dominated by a smooth component overlayed with two weak arc patterns with different separations.
The larger pattern is predicted by the binary interaction model with separations of 10" and therefore
likely due to the known companion. It is consistent with a binary orbit with low eccentricity. The
smaller separation pattern is asymmetric and coincides with the dust distribution, but the separation
timescale (200 yrs) is not consistent with any known process of the system. The separation of the
known companions of the system is large enough to not have a very strong effect on the circumstellar
morphology. The density contrast across the envelope of a binary with an even larger separation
will not be easily detectable, even with ALMA, unless the orbit is strongly asymmetric or the AGB
star has a much larger mass-loss rate.
