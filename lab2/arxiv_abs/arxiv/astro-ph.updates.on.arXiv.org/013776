Data-driven methods play an increasingly important role in the field of astrophysics. In the context
of large spectroscopic surveys of stars, data-driven methods are key in deducing physical parameters
for millions of spectra in a short time. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) enable us to connect
observables (e.g., spectra, stellar magnitudes) to physical properties (atmospheric parameters,
chemical abundances, or labels in general). We trained a CNN, adopting stellar atmospheric parameters
and chemical abundances from APOGEE DR16 (resolution R~22500) data as training set labels. As input
we used parts of the intermediate-resolution RAVE DR6 spectra (R~7500) overlapping with the APOGEE
DR16 data as well as broad-band ALL_WISE and 2MASS photometry together with Gaia DR2 photometry
and parallaxes. We derived precise atmospheric parameters Teff, log(g), [M/H] and chemical abundances
of [Fe/H], [alpha/M], [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [Ni/Fe] for 420165 RAVE spectra. The precision
typically amounts to 60K in Teff, 0.06 in log(g), and 0.02-0.04 dex for individual chemical abundances.
Incorporating photometry and astrometry as additional constraints substantially improves the
results in terms of accuracy and precision of the derived labels, as long as we operate in parts of
the parameter space that is well covered by the training sample. Scientific validation confirms
the robustness of the CNN results. We provide a catalog of CNN-trained atmospheric parameters and
abundances along with their uncertainties for 420165 stars in the RAVE survey. CNN-based methods
provide a powerful way to combine spectroscopic, photometric, and astrometric data, without applying
any priors in the form of stellar evolutionary models. The developed procedure can extend the scientific
output of RAVE spectra beyond DR6 to on-going and planned surveys such as Gaia RVS and 4MOST.
