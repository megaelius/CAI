We simulate the propagation of cosmic rays at ultra-high energies, $\gtrsim 10^{18}$ eV, in models
of extragalactic magnetic fields in constrained simulations of the local Universe. We use constrained
initial conditions with the cosmological magnetohydrodynamics code {\sc ENZO}. The resulting
models of the distribution of magnetic fields in the local Universe are used in the \crpropa code
to simulate the propagation of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. We investigate the impact of six different
magneto-genesis scenarios, both primordial and astrophysical, on the propagation of cosmic rays
over cosmological distances. Moreover, we study the influence of different source distributions
around the Milky Way. Our study shows that different scenarios of magneto-genesis do not have a large
impact on the anisotropy measurements of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. However, at high energies
above the GZK-limit, there is anisotropy caused by the distribution of nearby sources, independent
of the magnetic field model. This provides a chance to identify cosmic ray sources with future full-sky
measurements and high number statistics at the highest energies. Finally, we compare our results
to the dipole signal measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory. All our source models and magnetic
field models could reproduce the observed dipole amplitude with a pure iron injection composition.
Our results indicate that the dipole is observed due to clustering of secondary nuclei in direction
of nearby sources of heavy nuclei. A light injection composition is disfavoured by the non-observation
of anisotropy at energies of $4-8 \rm\ EeV$.
