Periodic flares of maser emission are thought to be induced either by variations of the seed photon
flux in young binary systems or the pump rate regulated by stellar and accretion luminosities. We
seek to study the variability of four maser transitions of three different species in G107.298+5.639
to constrain the dominant mechanism of periodic flares. Light curves of the 6.7 GHz methanol and
22.2 GHz water vapour maser were obtained with the Torun 32m radio telescope over 39 and 34 cycles,
respectively. The target was also monitored at the 1.6 GHz hydroxyl transitions with the Nan\c{c}ay
radio telescope over 13 cycles. All these maser lines were imaged using VLBI arrays. The study confirms
alternating flares of the methanol and water masers with a period of 34.4d and reveals the synchronised
behaviour of the methanol and hydroxyl masers in this source. The observed spatial distribution
of the methanol maser cloudlets and the measured time delays of the flares of individual features
imply a ring-like structure of radius 240au and thickness 30au. Internal proper motions indicate
that the velocity of methanol cloudlets is dominated by a disc-wind component of about 5km/s. The
methanol emission detected during only one VLBI observation is located in a region about 550au from
a central star, which also exhibits OH maser flares. The erratic appearance of methanol features
can be related to a powering object of relatively low luminosity which, during some variability
cycles, can excite molecules only in the nearest part of the disc. A careful analysis of the maser
and infrared light curves reveal a strong correlation between the 6.7 GHz line and the infrared flux
densities supporting a radiative pumping of the maser. The synchronised behaviour of the hydroxyl
and methanol transitions indicates a common pumping mechanism for the periodic flares of G107.298+5.639.
