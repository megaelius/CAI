In classical analyses of $\gamma$-ray data from IACTs, such as H.E.S.S., aperture photometry,
or photon counting, is applied in a (typically circular) region of interest (RoI) encompassing
the source. A key element in the analysis is to estimate the amount of background in the RoI due to residual
cosmic ray-induced air showers in the data. Various standard background estimation techniques
have been developed in the last decades, most of them rely on a measurement of the background from
source-free regions within the observed field of view. However, in particular in the Galactic plane,
source analysis and background estimation are hampered by the large number of, sometimes overlapping,
$\gamma$-ray sources and large-scale diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission. For complicated fields
of view, a three-dimensional (3D) likelihood analysis shows the potential to be superior to classical
analysis. In this analysis technique, a spectromorphological model, consisting of one or multiple
source components and a background component, is fitted to the data, resulting in a complete spectral
and spatial description of the field of view. For the application to IACT data, the major challenge
of such an approach is the construction of a robust background model. In this work, we apply the 3D
likelihood analysis to various test data recently made public by H.E.S.S., using the open analysis
frameworks ctools and Gammapy. First, we show that, when using these tools in a classical analysis
approach and comparing to the proprietary H.E.S.S. analysis framework, virtually identical high-level
analysis results are obtained. We then describe the construction of a generic background model
from data of H.E.S.S. observations, and demonstrate that a 3D likelihood analysis using this background
model yields high-level analysis results that are highly compatible with those obtained from the
classical analyses. (abridged)
