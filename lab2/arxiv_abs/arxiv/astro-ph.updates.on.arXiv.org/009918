We studied the correlation between brightness and polarization variations in 3C~279 at different
wavelengths, over time intervals long enough to cover the time lags due to opacity effects. We used
these correlations together with VLBI images to constrain the radio and high energy source position.We
made 7 mm radio continuum and $R$-band polarimetric observations of 3C~279 between 2009 and 2014.
The radio observations were performed at the Itapetinga Radio Observatory, while the polarimetric
data were obtained at Pico dos Dias Observatory, both in Brazil. We compared our observations with
the $\gamma$-ray Fermi/LAT and $R$-band SMARTS light curves. We found a good correlation between
7~mm and $R$-band light curves, with a delay of $170 \pm 30$ days in radio, but no correlation with
the $\gamma$ rays. However, a group of several $\gamma$-ray flares in April 2011 could be associated
with the start of the 7 mm strong activity observed at the end of 2011.We also detected an increase
in $R$-band polarization degree and rotation of the polarization angle simultaneous with these
flares. Contemporaneous VLBI images at the same radio frequency show two new strong components
close to the core, ejected in directions very different from that of the jet.The good correlation
between radio and $R$-band variability suggests that their origin is synchrotron radiation. The
lack of correlation with $\gamma$-rays produced by the Inverse Compton process on some occasions
could be due to the lack of low energy photons in the jet direction or to absorption of the high energy
photons by the broad line region clouds. The variability of the polarization parameters during
flares can be easily explained by the combination of the jet polarization parameters and those of
newly formed jet components.
