Galactic outflows play a major role in the evolution of galaxies, but the underlying physical processes
are poorly understood. This is mainly because we have little information about the outflow structure,
especially on large scales. In this paper, we probe the structure of galactic outflows in low-$z$
starburst by using a combination of ultra-violet spectroscopy and imaging of the fluorescence
emission lines (associated with transitions to excited fine-structure levels) and spectroscopy
of the corresponding strongly blue-shifted resonance absorption lines. We find that in the majority
of cases the observed fluorescence emission lines are much weaker and narrower than the absorption
lines, originating in the star-forming interstellar medium and/or the slowest-moving part of
the inner outflow. In a minority of cases, the outflowing absorbing material does make a significant
contribution to the fluorescence emission. These latter systems are characterized by both strong
Ly$\alpha$ emission lines and weak low-ionization absorption lines (both known to be empirical
signs of Lyman-continuum leakage). We argue that the observed weakness of emission from the outflow
seen in the majority of cases is due to the missing emission arising on scales larger than those encompassed
by the aperture of the {\it{Hubble Space Telescope}}. This implies shallow radial density profiles
in these outflows, and suggests that most of the observed absorbing material must be created/injected
at radii much larger than that of the starburst. This has important implications for our understanding
of both the physics of galactic outflows and for our estimation of their principal properties.
