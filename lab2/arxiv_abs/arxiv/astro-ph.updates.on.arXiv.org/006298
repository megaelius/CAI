Long gamma-ray bursts are produced during the dramatic deaths of massive stars with very short lifetimes,
meaning that they explode close to the birth place of their progenitors. During a short period they
become the most luminous objects observable in the Universe, being perfect beacons to study high-redshift
star-forming regions. To use the afterglow of GRB\,161023A at a redshift $z=2.710$ as a background
source to study the environment of the explosion and the intervening systems along its line-of-sight.
r the first time, we complement UV/Optical/NIR spectroscopy with millimetre spectroscopy using
ALMA, which allows us to probe the molecular content of the host galaxy. The X-shooter spectrum shows
a plethora of absorption features including fine-structure and metastable transitions of Fe,
Ni, Si, C and O. We present photometry ranging from 43 s to over 500 days after the burst. We infer a host-galaxy
metallicity of [Zn/H] $=-1.11\pm0.07$, which corrected for dust depletion results in [X/H] $=-0.94\pm0.08$.
We do not detect molecular features in the ALMA data, but we derive limits on the molecular content
of $log(N_{CO}/cm^{-2})<15.7$ and $log(N_{HCO+}/cm^{-2})<13.2$, which are consistent with
those that we obtain from the optical spectra, $log(N_{H_2}/cm^{-2})<15.2$ and $log(N_{CO}/cm^{-2})<14.5$.
Within the host galaxy we detect three velocity systems through UV/Optical/NIR absorption spectroscopy,
all with levels that were excited by the GRB afterglow. We determine the distance from these systems
to the GRB to be in the range between 0.7 and 1.0 kpc. The sight-line to GRB 161023A shows 9 independent
intervening systems, most of them with multiple components. (Abridged)
