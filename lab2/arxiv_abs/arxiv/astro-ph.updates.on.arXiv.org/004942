We performed sub-parsec ($\sim$ 0.014 pc) scale simulations of cloud-cloud collisions of two idealized
turbulent molecular clouds (MCs) with different masses in the range of $0.76 - 2.67 \times 10^4$M$_{\odot}$
and with collision speeds of 5 $-$ 30 km/s. Those parameters are larger than Takahira, Tasker and
Habe (2014) (paper I) in which the colliding system showed a partial gaseous arc morphology that
supports the NANTEN observations of objects indicated to be colliding MCs by numerical simulations.
Gas clumps with density greater than $10^{-20}$ g cm$^{-3}$ were identified as pre-stellar cores
and tracked through the simulation to investigate the effect of mass of colliding clouds and collision
speeds on the resulting core population. Our results demonstrate that smaller cloud property is
more important for results of cloud cloud collisions. The mass function of formed cores can be approximated
by a power law relation with index $\gamma$ = -1.6 in slower cloud cloud collisions ($v \sim 5 $ km/s),
in good agreement with observation of MCs. A faster relative velocity increases the number of cores
formed in the early stage of collisions and shortens gas accretion phase of cores in the shocked region,
leading to suppression of core growth. The bending point appears in the high mass part of the core
mass function and the bending point mass decreases with increasing of the collision velocity for
the same combination of colliding clouds. The high mass part of the core mass function than the bending
point mass can be approximated by a power law with $\gamma$ = -2.3 that is very similar to the power
index of the massive part of the observed initial stellar mass function. We discuss implication
of our results for the massive star formation in our Galaxy.
