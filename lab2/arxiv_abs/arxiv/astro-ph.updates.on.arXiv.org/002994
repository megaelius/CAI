The distribution of elements in galaxies provides a wealth of information about their production
sites and their subsequent mixing into the interstellar medium. Here we investigate the distribution
of elements within stars in the IllustrisTNG simulations. In particular, we analyze the abundance
ratios of magnesium and europium in Milky Way-like galaxies from the TNG100 simulation (stellar
masses ${\log} (M_\star / {\rm M}_\odot) \sim 9.7 - 11.2$). As abundances of magnesium and europium
for individual stars in the Milky Way are observed across a variety of spatial locations and metallicities,
comparison with the stellar abundances in our more than $850$ Milky Way-like galaxies provides
stringent constraints on our chemical evolutionary methods. To this end we use the magnesium to
iron ratio as a proxy for the effects of our SNII and SNIa metal return prescription, and a means to
compare our simulated abundances to a wide variety of galactic observations. The europium to iron
ratio tracks the rare ejecta from neutron star -- neutron star mergers, the assumed primary site
of europium production in our models, which in turn is a sensitive probe of the effects of metal diffusion
within the gas in our simulations. We find that europium abundances in Milky Way-like galaxies show
no correlation with assembly history, present day galactic properties, and average galactic stellar
population age. In general, we reproduce the europium to iron spread at low metallicities observed
in the Milky Way, with the level of enhancement being sensitive to gas properties during redshifts
$z \approx 2-4$. We show that while the overall normalization of [Eu/Fe] is susceptible to resolution
and post-processing assumptions, the relatively large spread of [Eu/Fe] at low [Fe/H] when compared
to that at high [Fe/H] is very robust.
