We elaborate the model of accretion disks of young stars with the fossil large-scale magnetic field
in the frame of Shakura and Sunyaev approximation. Equations of the MHD model include Shakura and
Sunyaev equations, induction equation and equations of ionization balance. Magnetic field is
determined taking into account ohmic diffusion, magnetic ambipolar diffusion and buoyancy. Ionization
fraction is calculated considering ionization by cosmic rays and X-rays, thermal ionization,
radiative recombinations and recombinations on the dust grains. Analytical solution and numerical
investigations show that the magnetic field is coupled to the gas in the case of radiative recombinations.
Magnetic field is quasi-azimuthal close to accretion disk inner boundary and quasi-radial in the
outer regions. Magnetic field is quasi-poloidal in the dusty "dead" zones with low ionization degree,
where ohmic diffusion is efficient. Magnetic ambipolar diffusion reduces vertical magnetic field
in 10 times comparing to the frozen-in field in this region. Magnetic field is quasi-azimuthal close
to the outer boundary of accretion disks for standard ionization rates and dust grain size a_d=0.1
micrometers. In the case of large dust grains (a_d > 0.1 micrometers) or enhanced ionization
rates, the magnetic field is quasi-radial in the outer regions. It is shown that the inner boundary
of dusty "dead" zone is placed at r=(0.1-0.6) AU for accretion disks of stars with M=(0.5-2) M_{\odot}.
Outer boundary of "dead" zone is placed at r=(3-21) AU and it is determined by magnetic ambipolar
diffusion. Mass of solid material in the "dead" zone is more than 3 M_{\oplus} for stars with M \geq
1 M_{\odot}.
