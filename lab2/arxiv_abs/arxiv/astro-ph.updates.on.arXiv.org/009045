Changing-look quasars are a newly-discovered class of luminous active galactic nuclei that undergo
rapid ($\lesssim$10 year) transitions between Type 1 and Type 1.9/2, with an associated change
in their continuum emission. We characterize the host galaxies of four faded changing-look quasars
using broadband optical imaging. We use \textit{gri} images obtained with the Gemini Multi Object
Spectrograph (GMOS) on Gemini North to characterize the surface brightness profiles of the quasar
hosts and search for [O III] $\lambda4959,\lambda5007$ emission from spatially extended regions,
or voorwerpjes, with the goal of using them to examine past luminosity history. Although we do not
detect, voorwerpjes surrounding the four quasar host galaxies, we take advantage of the dim nuclear
emission to characterize the colors and morphologies of the host galaxies. Three of the four galaxies
show morphological evidence of merger activity or tidal features in their residuals. The three
galaxies which are not highly distorted are fit with a single S\'ersic profile to characterize their
overall surface brightness profiles. The single-S\'ersic fits give intermediate S\'ersic indices
between the $n=1$ of disk galaxies and the $n=4$ of ellipticals. On a color-magnitude diagram, our
changing-look quasar host galaxies reside in the blue cloud, with other AGN host galaxies and star-forming
galaxies. On a color-S\'ersic index diagram the changing-look quasar hosts reside with other AGN
hosts in the "green valley". Our analysis suggests that the hosts of changing-look quasars are predominantly
disrupted or merging galaxies that resemble AGN hosts, rather than inactive galaxies.
