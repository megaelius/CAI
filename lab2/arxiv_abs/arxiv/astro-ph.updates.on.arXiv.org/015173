New observations of the quasar HE0515$-$4414 have been made using the HARPS spectrograph on the
ESO 3.6m telescope, aided by the Laser Frequency Comb (LFC). We present three important advances
for $\alpha$ measurements in quasar absorption spectra from these observations. Firstly, the
data have been wavelength calibrated using LFC and ThAr methods. The LFC wavelength calibration
residuals are six times smaller than when using the standard ThAr calibration. We give a direct comparison
between $\alpha$ measurements made using the two methods. Secondly, spectral modelling was performed
using Artificial Intelligence (fully automated, all human bias eliminated), including a temperature
parameter for each absorption component. Thirdly, in contrast to previous work, additional model
parameters were assigned to measure $\alpha$ for each individual absorption component. The increase
in statistical uncertainty from the larger number of model parameters is small and the method allows
a substantial advantage; outliers that would otherwise contribute a significant systematic,
possibly corrupting the entire measurement, are identified and removed, permitting a more robust
overall result. The $z_{abs} = 1.15$ absorption system along the HE0515$-$4414 sightline yields
40 new $\alpha$ measurements. We constrain spatial fluctuations in $\alpha$ to be $\Delta\alpha/\alpha
\leq 9 \times 10^{-5}$ on scales $\approx 20\;{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$, corresponding to $\approx25\;$kpc
if the $z_{abs} = 1.15$ system arises in a $1\;$Mpc cluster. Collectively, the 40 measurements yield
$\Delta\alpha/\alpha=-0.27\pm2.41\times10^{-6}$, consistent with no variation.
