We present light curves and spectra of the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-18pg / AT 2018dyb
spanning a period of seven months. The event shows a plethora of strong emission lines, including
the Balmer series, He II, He I and metal lines of O III $\lambda$3760 and N III $\lambda\lambda$ 4100
and 4640. The latter lines are consistent with originating from the Bowen fluorescence mechanism.
By analyzing literature spectra of past events, we conclude that these lines are common in TDEs.
The spectral diversity of optical TDEs is thus larger than previously thought and includes N-rich
besides H- and He-rich events. We study how the spectral lines evolve with time, by means of their
width, relative strength and velocity offsets. The velocity width of the lines starts at ~ 12,000
km s$^{-1}$ and decreases with time. The ratio of H$\alpha$ to H$\beta$ remains close to three, while
the ratio of He II over N III increases with time. The same is true for ASASSN-14li, which has a very
similar spectrum to AT 2018dyb but its lines are narrower by a factor of $>$2. High-resolution spectroscopy
at maximum light does not reveal any narrow features that can be attributed to the TDE. By fitting
the light curves of AT 2018dyb we estimate a mass of $4^{+5}_{-2}\times 10^6 M_{\odot}$ for the black
hole and of $0.7^{+4}_{-0.6} M_{\odot}$ for the disrupted star. The detection of strong Bowen lines
in the optical spectrum is an indirect proof for extreme ultraviolet and (re-processed) X-ray radiation
and favors an accretion origin for the TDE optical luminosity. A model where photons escape after
multiple scatterings through a super-Eddington thick disk and its optically-thick wind, viewed
at an angle close to the disk plane, is consistent with the observations. (Abridged)
