A fundamental bimodality of galaxies in the local Universe is apparent in many of the features used
to describe them. Multiple sub-populations exist within this framework, each representing galaxies
following distinct evolutionary pathways. Accurately identifying and characterising these
sub-populations requires that a large number of galaxy features be analysed simultaneously. Future
galaxy surveys such as LSST and Euclid will yield data volumes for which traditional approaches
to galaxy classification will become unfeasible. To address this, we apply a robust $k$-means unsupervised
clustering method to feature data derived from a sample of 7338 local-Universe galaxies selected
from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. This allows us to partition our sample into $k$ clusters
without the need for training on pre-labelled data, facilitating a full census of our high dimensionality
feature space and guarding against stochastic effects. We find that the local galaxy population
natively splits into $2$, $3$, $5$ and a maximum of $6$ sub-populations, with each corresponding
to a distinct ongoing evolutionary mechanism. Notably, the impact of the local environment appears
strongly linked with the evolution of low-mass ($M_{*} < 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$) galaxies, with
more massive systems appearing to evolve more passively from the blue cloud onto the red sequence.
With a typical run time of $\sim3$ minutes per value of $k$ for our galaxy sample, we show how $k$-means
unsupervised clustering is an ideal tool for future analysis of large extragalactic datasets,
being scalable, adaptable, and providing crucial insight into the fundamental properties of the
local galaxy population.
