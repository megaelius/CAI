The study of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) has motivated the development of sensitive low
temperature detectors scalable to form large arrays. Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) satisfy
the requirements for CMB spectrum, anisotropy and polarization measurements. They are intrinsically
multiplexable, fast, robust and compact, and do not require complex microfabrication steps. The
principle of operation of a KID is based on the electrical properties of superconducting films.
Incoming mm-wave radiation, incident on a superconducting film, breaks Cooper pairs and changes
the relative number density of the paired and unpaired charge carriers, inducing a change in the
electrical properties of the superconductor. In a superconducting film shaped as a high-Q microwave
resonator, the incoming radiation intensity induces changes in the resonant frequency and quality
factor, $Q$, of the KID. This technology has been already demonstrated in the field for ground-based
instrumentation, and represents a viable solution for the next generation of sensitive large-format
mm-wave cameras. Nonetheless, space-borne applications of KIDs still need to be proven in representative
conditions. We designed, fabricated, and characterized four arrays of horn-coupled, lumped element
kinetic inductance detectors (LEKIDs), optimized to work in the spectral bands of the balloon-borne
OLIMPO experiment. OLIMPO is a 2.6m aperture telescope, aimed at spectroscopic measurements of
the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. OLIMPO will also validate the LEKID technology in a representative
space environment. The corrected focal plane is filled with diffraction limited horn-coupled
KID arrays, with 19, 37, 23, 41 active pixels respectively at 150, 250, 350, and 460GHz.
