The recent discovery of TeV emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) by the MAGIC and H.E.S.S. Cherenkov
telescopes confirmed that emission from these transients can extend to very high energies. The
TeV energy domain reaches the most sensitive band of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). This newly
anticipated, improved sensitivity will enhance the prospects of gravitational-wave follow-up
observations by CTA to probe particle acceleration and high-energy emission from binary black
hole and neutron star mergers, and stellar core-collapse events. Here we discuss the implications
of TeV emission on the most promising strategies of choice for the gravitational-wave follow-up
effort for CTA and Cherenkov telescopes more broadly. We find that TeV emission (i) may allow more
than an hour of delay between the gravitational-wave event and the start of CTA observations; (ii)
enables the use of CTA's small size telescopes that have the largest fields of view. We characterize
the number of pointings needed to find a counterpart. (iii) We compute the annual follow-up time
requirements and find that prioritization will be needed. (iv) Even a few telescopes could detect
sufficiently nearby counterparts, raising the possibility of adding a handful of small-size or
medium-size telescopes to the network at diverse geographic locations taking into account the
positions of CTA and the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network. (v) The continued operation of VERITAS/H.E.S.S./MAGIC
would be a useful compliment to CTA's follow-up capabilities by increasing the sky area that can
be rapidly covered, especially for directions above and 'below' the United States in which the present
network of gravitational-wave detectors is more sensitive.
