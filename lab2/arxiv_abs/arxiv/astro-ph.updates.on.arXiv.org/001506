We present a comparison of the molecular gas properties in the outflow vs. in the ambient medium of
the local prototype radio-loud and ultraluminous-infrared galaxy 4C12.50 (IRAS13451+1232),
using new data from the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer and 30m telescope, and the Herschel space
telescope. Previous H_2 (0-0) S(1) and S(2) observations with the Spitzer space telescope had indicated
that the warm (~400K) molecular gas in 4C12.50 is made up of a 1.4(+-0.2)x10^8 M_sun ambient reservoir
and a 5.2(+-1.7)x10^7 M_sun outflow. The new CO(1-0) data cube indicates that the corresponding
cold (25K) H_2 gas mass is 1.0(+-0.1)x10^10 M_sun for the ambient medium and <1.3x10^8 M_sun
for the outflow, when using a CO-intensity-to-H_2-mass conversion factor alpha of 0.8 M_sun /(K
km/s pc^2). The combined mass outflow rate is high, 230-800 M_sun/yr, but the amount of gas that could
escape the galaxy is low. A potential inflow of gas from a 3.3(+-0.3)x10^8 M_sun tidal tail could
moderate any mass loss. The mass ratio of warm-to-cold molecular gas is >= 30 times higher in the
outflow than in the ambient medium, indicating that a non-negligible fraction of the accelerated
gas is heated to temperatures at which star formation is inefficient. This conclusion is robust
against the use of different alpha factor values, and/or different warm gas tracers (H_2 vs. H_2
plus CO): with the CO-probed gas mass being at least 40 times lower at 400K than at 25K, the total warm-to-cold
mass ratio is always lower in the ambient gas than in the entrained gas. Heating of the molecular gas
could facilitate the detection of new outflows in distant galaxies by enhancing their emission
in intermediate rotational number CO lines.
