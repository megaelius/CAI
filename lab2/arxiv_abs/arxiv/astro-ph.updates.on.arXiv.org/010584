The gravitational wave and electromagnetic signatures connected to the merger of two neutron stars
allow us to test the nature of matter at supranuclear densities. Since the Equation of State governing
the interior of neutron stars is only loosely constrained, there is even the possibility that strange
quark matter exists inside the core of neutron stars. We investigate how strange quark matter cores
affect the binary neutron star coalescence by performing numerical relativity simulations. Interestingly,
the strong phase transition can cause a reduction of the convergence order of the numerical schemes
to first order if the numerical resolution is not high enough. Therefore, an additional challenge
is added in producing high-quality gravitational wave templates for Equation of States with a strong
phase transition. Focusing on one particular configuration of an equal mass configuration consistent
with GW170817, we compute and discuss the associated gravitational wave signal and some of the electromagnetic
counterparts connected to the merger of the two stars. We find that existing waveform approximants
employed for the analysis of GW170817 allow describing this kind of systems within the numerical
uncertainties, which, however, are several times larger than for pure hadronic Equation of States,
which means that even higher resolutions have been employed for an accurate gravitational wave
model comparison. We also show that for the chosen Equation of State, quasi-universal relations
describing the gravitational wave emission after the moment of merger seem to hold and that the electromagnetic
signatures connected to our chosen setup would not be bright enough to explain the kilonova associated
to GW170817.
