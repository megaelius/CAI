The analysis of photometric time series in the context of transiting planet surveys suffers from
the presence of stellar signals, often dubbed "stellar noise". These signals, caused by stellar
oscillations and granulation, can usually be disregarded for main-sequence stars, as the stellar
contributions average out when phase-folding the light curve. For evolved stars, however, the
amplitudes of such signals are larger and the timescales similar to the transit duration of short-period
planets, requiring that they be modeled alongside the transit. With the promise of TESS delivering
on the order of $\sim\!10^5$ light curves for stars along the red-giant branch, there is a need for
a method capable of describing the "stellar noise" while simultaneously modelling an exoplanet's
transit. In this work, a Gaussian Process regression framework is used to model stellar light curves
and the method validated by applying it to TESS-like artificial data. Furthermore, the method is
used to characterize the stellar oscillations and granulation of a sample of well-studied \textit{Kepler}
low-luminosity red-giant branch stars. The parameters determined are compared to equivalent
ones obtained by modelling the power spectrum of the light curve. Results show that the method presented
is capable of describing the stellar signals in the time domain and can also return an accurate and
precise measurement of $\nu_\text{max}$, i.e., the frequency of maximum oscillation amplitude.
Preliminary results show that using the method in transit modelling improves the precision and
accuracy of the ratio between the planetary and stellar radius, $R_p/R_\star$. The method's implementation
is publicly available.
