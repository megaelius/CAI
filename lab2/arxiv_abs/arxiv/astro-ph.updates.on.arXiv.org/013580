Wave propagation in magnetically structured atmospheres is a thoroughly studied, yet practically
inexhaustible well of investigations in the field of solar magneto-seismology. A simple but powerful
example is the examination of wave behaviour in a magnetic slab. Our previous study (Zs\'amberger,
Allcock and Erd\'elyi, Astrophys. J., 853, p. 136, 2018) used an analytical approach to derive the
general dispersion relation for magneto-acoustic waves in a magnetic slab of homogeneous plasma,
which was enclosed in an asymmetric magnetic environment. In the present study, we focus on the analysis
of wave propagation in various limiting cases applicable to solar and space plasma or astrophysics.
The thin- and wide-slab approximations, as well as the limits of low and high plasma-beta values
are considered. Utilising the fact that in a weakly asymmetric slab, the dispersion relation can
be decoupled, the behaviour of quasi-sausage and quasi-kink modes is studied in further analytical
and numerical detail, and their avoided crossings are described. The results highlight how the
asymmetry influences the wave properties, e.g. the phase speed of eigenmodes, depending on the
ratios of external-to-internal densities and magnetic fields on the two sides. Notably, the phase
speeds of surface modes will converge to different values for quasi-sausage and quasi-kink modes
in the wide-slab limit, and cut-off frequencies are introduced with respect to both surface and
body modes, in thin as well as wide slabs, beyond which the solutions become leaky. These obtained
properties of MHD wave behaviour could be measured with suitable high-resolution instruments
in the future.
