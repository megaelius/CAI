Cross-correlations between the galaxy number density in a lensing source sample and that in an overlapping
spectroscopic sample can in principle be used to calibrate the lensing source redshift distribution.
In this paper, we study in detail to what extent this cross-correlation method can mitigate loss
of cosmological information in upcoming weak lensing surveys (combined with a CMB prior) due to
lack of knowledge of the source distribution. We consider a scenario where photometric redshifts
are available, and find that, unless the photometric redshift distribution p(z_{ph}|z) is calibrated
very accurately a priori (bias and scatter known to ~0.002 for, e.g., EUCLID), the additional constraint
on p(z_{ph}|z) from the cross correlation technique to a large extent restores the cosmological
information originally lost due to the uncertainty in dn/dz(z). Considering only the gain in photo-z
accuracy and not the additional cosmological information, enhancements of the dark energy figure
of merit of up to a factor of 3 (23) can be achieved for a SuMIRe (Subaru Measurement of Images and Redshifts,
the combination of the Hyper Suprime Cam lensing survey and the Prime Focus Spectrograph redshift
survey)-like (EUCLID-like) combination of lensing and redshift surveys. However, the success
of the method is strongly sensitive to our knowledge of the galaxy bias evolution in the source sample.
If this bias is modeled by a free parameter in each of a large number of redshift bins, we find that a
prior of order 0.01 is needed on b_i \sqrt{\Delta z} in each redshift slice (where \Delta z is the bin
width and b_i the value of the galaxy bias in the i-th source bin) to optimize the gains from the cross-correlation
method (i.e. to approach the cosmology constraints attainable if the bias were known exactly).[abridged]
