Cosmological data can be used to search for---and characterize---light particles in the standard
model, if these populate our Universe. In addition to the well-known effect of these light relics
in the background cosmology, usually parametrized through a change in the effective number $N_{\rm
eff}$ of neutrino species, these particles can become nonrelativistic at later times, affecting
the growth of matter fluctuations due to their thermal velocities. An extensively studied example
is that of massive neutrinos, which are known to produce a suppression in the matter power spectrum
due to their free streaming. Galaxies, as biased traces of matter fluctuations, can therefore provide
us with a wealth of information about both known and unknown degrees of freedom in the standard model.
To harness this information, however, the galaxy bias has to be determined in the presence of massive
relics, which is expected to vary with scale. Here we present the code RelicFast, which efficiently
computes the scale-dependent bias induced by relics of different masses, spins, and temperatures,
through spherical collapse and the peak-background split. Using this code, we find that, in general,
the bias induced by light relics partially compensates the suppression of power, and should be accounted
for in any search for relics with galaxy data. In particular, for the case of neutrinos, we find that
both the normal and inverted hierarchies present a percent-level step in the Lagrangian bias, with
a size scaling linearly with the neutrino-mass sum, in agreement with recent simulations. RelicFast
can compute halo bias in under a second, allowing for this effect to be properly included for different
cosmologies, and light relics, at little computational cost.
