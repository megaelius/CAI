We identify multi-wavelength counterparts to 1,147 submillimeter sources from the S2COSMOS SCUBA-2
survey of the COSMOS field by employing a recently developed radio$+$machine-learning method
trained on a large sample of ALMA-identified submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), including 260 SMGs
identified in the AS2COSMOS pilot survey. In total, we identify 1,222 optical/near-infrared(NIR)/radio
counterparts to the 897 S2COSMOS submillimeter sources with S$_{850}$>1.6mJy, yielding an overall
identification rate of ($78\pm9$)%. We find that ($22\pm5$)% of S2COSMOS sources have multiple
identified counterparts. We estimate that roughly 27% of these multiple counterparts within the
same SCUBA-2 error circles very likely arise from physically associated galaxies rather than line-of-sight
projections by chance. The photometric redshift of our radio$+$machine-learning identified
SMGs ranges from z=0.2 to 5.7 and peaks at $z=2.3\pm0.1$. The AGN fraction of our sample is ($19\pm4$)%,
which is consistent with that of ALMA SMGs in the literature. Comparing with radio/NIR-detected
field galaxy population in the COSMOS field, our radio+machine-learning identified counterparts
of SMGs have the highest star-formation rates and stellar masses. These characteristics suggest
that our identified counterparts of S2COSMOS sources are a representative sample of SMGs at z<3.
We employ our machine-learning technique to the whole COSMOS field and identified 6,877 potential
SMGs, most of which are expected to have submillimeter emission fainter than the confusion limit
of our S2COSMOS surveys (S$_{850}$<1.5mJy). We study the clustering properties of SMGs based on
this statistically large sample, finding that they reside in high-mass dark matter halos ($(1.2\pm0.3)\times10^{13}\,h^{-1}\,\rm
M_{\odot}$), which suggests that SMGs may be the progenitors of massive ellipticals we see in the
local Universe.
