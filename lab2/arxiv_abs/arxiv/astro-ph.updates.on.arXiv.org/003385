Reliable extraction of cosmological information from clustering measurements of galaxy surveys
requires estimation of the error covariance matrices of observables. The accuracy of covariance
matrices is limited by our ability to generate sufficiently large number of independent mock catalogs
that can describe the physics of galaxy clustering across a wide range of scales. Furthermore, galaxy
mock catalogs are required to study systematics in galaxy surveys and to test analysis tools. In
this investigation, we present a fast and accurate approach for generation of mock catalogs for
the upcoming galaxy surveys. Our method relies on low-resolution approximate gravity solvers
to simulate the large scale dark matter field, which we then populate with halos according to a flexible
nonlinear and stochastic bias model. In particular, we extend the \textsc{patchy} code with an
efficient particle mesh algorithm to simulate the dark matter field (the \textsc{FastPM} code),
and with a robust MCMC method relying on the \textsc{emcee} code for constraining the parameters
of the bias model. Using the halos in the BigMultiDark high-resolution $N$-body simulation as a
reference catalog, we demonstrate that our technique can model the bivariate probability distribution
function (counts-in-cells), power spectrum, and bispectrum of halos in the reference catalog.
Specifically, we show that the new ingredients permit us to reach percentage accuracy in the power
spectrum up to $k\sim 0.4\; \,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ (within 5\% up to $k\sim 0.6\; \,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$)
with accurate bispectra improving previous results based on Lagrangian perturbation theory.
