We explore the properties of galaxies on the outskirts of clusters and their dependence on recent
dynamical history in order to understand the real impact that the cluster core has on the evolution
of galaxies. We analyse the properties of more than 1000 galaxies brighter than $M_{^{0.1}r}$=-19.6
on the outskirts of 90 clusters ($1<r/r_{vir}<2$) in the redshift range $0.05<z<0.10$.
Using the line of sight velocity, we selected high and low velocity subsamples. Theoretical predictions
indicate that a significant fraction of the first subsample should be backsplash galaxies, that
is, objects that have already orbited near the cluster centre. A significant proportion of the sample
of high relative velocity HV galaxies seems to be composed of infalling objects. Our results suggest
that, at fixed stellar mass, late type galaxies in the low velocity LV sample are systematically
older, redder and have formed fewer stars during the last 3 Gyrs than galaxies in the HV sample. This
result is consistent with models that assume that the central regions of clusters are effective
in quenching the star formation by means of processes such as ram pressure stripping or strangulation.
At fixed stellar mass, LV galaxies show some evidence of having higher surface brightness and smaller
size than HV galaxies. These results are consistent with the scenario where galaxies that have orbited
the central regions of clusters are more likely to suffer tidal effects, producing loss of mass as
well as a redistribution of matter towards more compact configurations. Finally, we found a higher
fraction of ET galaxies in the LV sample, supporting the idea that the central region of clusters
of galaxies may contribute to the transformation of morphological types towards earlier types.
