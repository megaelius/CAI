In this paper, we motivate the use of galaxy clustering measurements using photometric redshift
information, including a contribution from flux magnification, as a probe of cosmology. We present
cosmological forecasts when clustering data alone is used, and when clustering is combined with
a cosmic shear analysis. We consider two types of clustering analysis: firstly, clustering with
only redshift auto-correlations in tomographic redshift bins; secondly, using all available
redshift bin correlations. Finally, we consider how inferred cosmological parameters may be biased
using each analysis when flux magnification is neglected. Results are presented for a Stage III
ground-based survey, and a Stage IV space-based survey modelled with photometric redshift errors,
and values for the slope of the luminosity function inferred from CFHTLenS catalogues. We find that
combining clustering information with shear can improve constraints on cosmological parameters,
giving an improvement to a Dark Energy Task Force-like figure of merit by a factor of 1.33 when only
auto-correlations in redshift are used for the clustering analysis, rising to 1.52 when cross-correlations
in redshift are also included. The addition of galaxy-galaxy lensing gives further improvement,
with increases in figure of merit by a factor of 2.82 and 3.7 for each type of clustering analysis respectively.
The presence of flux magnification in a clustering analysis does not significantly affect the precision
of cosmological constraints when combined with cosmic shear and galaxy-galaxy lensing. However
if magnification is neglected, inferred cosmological parameter values are biased, with biases
in some cosmological parameters larger than statistical errors. (Abridged)
