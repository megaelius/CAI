Galaxy halos appear to be missing a large fraction of their baryons, most probably hiding in the circumgalactic
medium (CGM), a diffuse component within the dark matter halo that extends far from the inner regions
of the galaxies. A powerful tool to study the CGM gas is offered by absorption lines in the spectra
of background quasars. Here, we present optical (MUSE) and mm (ALMA) observations of the field of
the quasar Q1130-1449 which includes a log [N(H I)/cm^-2]=21.71+/-0.07 absorber at z=0.313. Ground-based
VLT/MUSE 3D spectroscopy shows 11 galaxies at the redshift of the absorber down to a limiting SFR>0.01
M_sun yr^-1 (covering emission lines of [OII], Hbeta, [OIII], [NII] and Halpha), 7 of which are new
discoveries. In particular, we report a new emitter with a smaller impact parameter to the quasar
line-of-sight (b=10.6 kpc) than the galaxies detected so far. Three of the objects are also detected
in CO(1-0) in our ALMA observations indicating long depletion timescales for the molecular gas
and kinematics consistent with the ionised gas. We infer from dedicated numerical cosmological
RAMSES zoom-in simulations that the physical properties of these objects qualitatively resemble
a small group environment, possibly part of a filamentary structure. Based on metallicity and velocity
arguments, we conclude that the neutral gas traced in absorption is only partly related to these
emitting galaxies while a larger fraction is likely the signature of gas with surface brightness
almost four orders of magnitude fainter that current detection limits. Together, these findings
challenge a picture where strong-HI quasar absorbers are associated with a single bright galaxy
and favour a scenario where the HI gas probed in absorption is related to far more complex galaxy structures.
