The aim of this work is to improve the modelling of ion populations in higher density, lower temperature
astrophysical plasmas, of the type commonly found in lower solar and stellar atmospheres. Ion population
models for these regions frequently employ the coronal approximation, which assumes conditions
more suitable to the upper solar atmosphere, where high temperatures and lower densities prevail.
Using the coronal approximation for modelling the solar transition region gives theoretical lines
intensities for the Li-like and Na-like isoelectronic sequences which can be factors of 2-5 times
lower than observed. The works of Burgess & Summers (1969) and Nussbaumer & Storey (1975) showed
the important part ions in excited levels play when included in the modelling. Their models, however,
used approximations for the atomic rates to determine the ion balance. Presented here is the first
stage in updating these earlier models of carbon by using rates from up-to-date atomic calculations
and more recent photo-ionising radiances for the quiet Sun. Where such atomic rates are not readily
available, in the case of electron-impact direct ionisation and excitation--auto-ionisation,
new calculations have been made and compared to theoretical and experimental studies. The effects
each atomic process has on the ion populations as density changes is demonstrated, and final results
from the modelling are compared to the earlier works. Lastly, the new results for ion populations
are used to predict line intensities for the solar transition region in the quiet Sun, and these are
compared with predictions from coronal-approximation modelling and with observations. Significant
improvements in the predicted line intensities are seen in comparison to those obtained from zero-density
modelling of carbon.
