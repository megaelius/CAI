Asteroseismology of white dwarf (WD) stars is a powerful tool that allows to reveal the hidden chemical
structure of WD and infer details about their evolution by comparing the observed periods with those
obtained from stellar models. A recent asteroseismological study has reproduced the period spectrum
of the helium rich pulsating WD KIC 08626021 with an unprecedented precision. The chemical structure
derived from that analysis is notably different from that expected for a WD according to currently
accepted formation channels, thus posing a challenge to the theory of stellar evolution. We explore
the relevant micro- and macro-physics processes acting during the formation and evolution of KIC
08626021 that could lead to a chemical structure similar to that found through asteroseismology.
We quantify to which extent is necessary to modify the physical processes that shapes the chemical
structure, in order to reproduce the most important features of the asteroseismic model. We model
the previous evolution of KIC 08626021 by exploring specific changes in the 12C+alpha reaction
rate, screening processes, microscopic diffusion, as well as convective boundary mixing during
core-He burning. We find that, in order to reproduce the core chemical profile derived for KIC 0862602,
the 12C+alpha nuclear reaction rate has to be increased by a factor of $\sim$ 10 during the helium-core
burning, and reduced by a factor of $\sim$ 1000 during the following helium-shell burning, as compared
with the standard predictions for this rate. In addition, the main chemical structures derived
for KIC 0862602 cannot be reconciled with our present knowledge of white dwarf formation. We find
that within our current understanding of white dwarf formation and evolution, it is difficult to
reproduce the most important asteroseismologically-derived features of the chemical structure
of KIC 08626021.
