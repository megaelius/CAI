Jupiter Trojans are are characterized by dark photometric colors, high inclinations and an asymmetry
in number of bodies between the two swarms. Different models have been proposed to explain the high
inclination of the Trojans and to interpret their relation with the TNOs, but none of them can also
satisfactorily explain the asymmetry ratio. Recently it has been found that the asymmetry can arise
if Jupiter has migrated inwards by at least a few au during its growth. The asymmetry and the dark colors
of the Trojans are natural outcomes of this model, but simulations with massless unperturbed disc
particles led to a flat distribution of the Trojan inclinations and a final total mass that was 3-4
orders of magnitude larger than the current one. In our work, we investigate the possible origin
of the peculiar inclination distribution of the Trojans in the scenario where Jupiter migrates
inwards. We analyze different possibilities: (a) the secular evolution of an initially flat Trojan
population, (b) the presence of planetary embryos among the Trojans and (c) capture of the Trojans
from a pre-stirred planetesimal population. We find that the secular evolution of the Trojans and
Saturn do not affect the Trojan inclinations appreciably, nor is there any significant mass depletion.
Embryos embedded in the swarms, in contrast, can stir the Trojan inclinations and can also deplete
the swarms efficiently, but it turns out that it is very difficult to get rid of all of the massive bodies.
We propose that the disc where Jupiter's core was forming was already excited by the presence of other
embryos competing in Jupiter's core's feeding zone. We show that the trapped Trojans preserve their
high inclination through the gas phase of the disc and that Saturn's perturbations are more effective
on highly inclined Trojans, leading to a lower capture efficiency and to a substantial depletion
of the swarms.
