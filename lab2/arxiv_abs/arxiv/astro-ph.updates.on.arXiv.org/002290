In principle, the most straightforward method of estimating the Hubble constant relies on time
delays between mirage images of strongly-lensed sources. It is a puzzle, then, that the values of
H$_0$ obtained with this method span a range from $\sim 50 - 100$ km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$. Quasars
monitored to measure these time delays, are multi-component objects. The variability may arise
from different components of the quasar or may even originate from a jet. Misidentifying a variable
emitting region in a jet with emission from the core region may introduce an error in the Hubble constant
derived from a time delay. Here, we investigate the complex structure of sources as the underlying
physical explanation of the wide spread in values of the Hubble constant based on gravitational
lensing. Our Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the potentially large impact of the position
of the variable emitting region on H$_0$ determination. The derived value of the Hubble constant
is very sensitive to the offset between the center of the emission and the center of the variable emitting
region. Based on these simulations, we propose using the value of H$_0$ known from other techniques
to spatially resolve the origin of the variable emission once the time delay is measured. We advocate
this method particularly for gamma-ray astronomy, where the angular resolution of detectors reaches
approximately 0.1 degree; lensed blazars offer the only route for identify the origin of gamma-ray
flares. Large future samples of gravitationally lensed sources identified with Euclid, SKA, and
LSST will enable a statistical determination of H$_0$. The method should also provide new insights
into the structure of the sources and their cosmic evolution at different energies.
