Theory and observations indicate that the distribution of stars along the horizontal branch of
Galactic globular clusters mainly depends on the metal content. However, the existence of globular
clusters with similar metal content and absolute age but different horizontal branch morphologies,
suggests the presence of another parameter affecting the star distribution along the branch. To
investigate the variation of the horizontal branch morphology in Galactic globular clusters,
we define a new photometric horizontal branch morphology index, overcoming some of the limitations
and degeneracies affecting similar indices available in the literature. We took advantage of a
sample of 64 Galactic globular clusters, with both space-based imaging data and homogeneous ground
based photometric catalogues in five different bands ($U$,$B$,$V$, $R$, $I$). The new index, $\tau_{HB}$,
is defined as the ratio between the areas subtended by the cumulative number distribution in magnitude
($I$) and in colour ($V-I$) of all stars along the horizontal branch. This new index shows a linear
trend over the entire range in metallicity (-2.35 $\leq$ [Fe/H] $\leq$ -0.12) covered by our Galactic
globular cluster sample. We found a linear relation between $\tau_{HB}$ and absolute cluster ages.
We also found a quadratic anti-correlation with [Fe/H], becoming linear when we eliminate the age
effect on $\tau_{HB}$ values. Moreover, we identified a subsample of eight clusters which are peculiar
according to their $\tau_{HB}$ values. These clusters have bluer horizontal branch morphology
when compared to typical ones of similar metallicity. These findings allow us to define them as the
"second parameter" clusters in the sample. A comparison with synthetic horizontal branch models
suggests that they cannot be entirely explained with a spread in helium content.
