I use distance- and mass-limited subsamples of the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies
(S4G) to investigate how the presence of bars in spiral galaxies depends on mass, colour, and gas
content and whether large, SDSS-based investigations of bar frequencies agree with local data.
Bar frequency reaches a maximum of $\approx 0.70$ at $M_{\star} \sim 10^{9.7} M_{\odot}$, declining
to both lower and higher masses. It is roughly constant over a wide range of colours ($g - r \approx
0.1$-0.8) and atomic gas fractions ($\log (M_{HI} / M_{\star}) \approx -2.5$ to 1). Bars are thus
as common in blue, gas-rich galaxies are they are in red, gas-poor galaxies. This is in sharp contrast
to many SDSS-based studies of $z \sim 0.01$-0.1 galaxies, which report f_bar increasing strongly
to higher masses (from $M_{\star} \sim 10^{10}$ to $10^{11} M_{\odot}$), redder colours, and lower
gas fractions. The contradiction can be explained if SDSS-based studies preferentially miss bars
in, and underestimate the bar fraction for, lower-mass (bluer, gas-rich) galaxies due to poor spatial
resolution and the correlation between bar size and stellar mass. Simulations of SDSS-style observations
using the S4G galaxies as a parent sample, and assuming that bars below a threshold angular size of
twice the PSF FWHM cannot be identified, successfully reproduce typical SDSS f_bar trends for stellar
mass and gas mass ratio. Similar considerations may affect high-redshift studies, especially
if bars grow in length over cosmic time; simulations suggest that high-redshift bar fractions may
thus be systematically underestimated.
