MHD waves are ubiquitous in the solar corona where the highly structured magnetic fields provide
efficient wave guides for their propagation. While MHD waves have been observed originating from
lower layers of the solar atmosphere, recent studies have shown that some can be generated in-situ
by the collision of dense counter propagating flows. In this theoretical study, we analyse the mechanism
that triggers the propagation of kink and sausage modes in the solar corona, following the collision
of counter-propagating flows and how the properties of the flows affect the properties of the generated
waves. In order to study in detail such a mechanism we run a series of ideal 2D and 3D MHD simulations
where we vary the properties of the counter-propagating flows and by means of a simple technique
to estimate the amplitudes of the kink and sausage modes, we investigate their role on the generation
and propagation of the MHD waves. We find that the amplitude of the waves is largely dependent on the
kinetic energy of the flows and that the onset of kink or sausage modes depends on the asymmetries
between the colliding blobs. Moreover, the initial wavelength of the MHD waves is associated with
the magnetic configuration resulting from the collision of the flows. We also find that genuine
3D systems respond with smaller wave amplitudes. In this study, we present a parameter space description
of the mechanism that leads to the generation of MHD waves from the collision of flows in the corona.
Future observations of these waves can be used to understand the properties of the plasma and magnetic
field of the solar corona.
