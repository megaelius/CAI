We present the measured Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) flux from 474 optically-selected MaxBCG clusters
that fall within the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Equatorial survey region. The ACT Equatorial
region used in this analysis covers 510 square degrees and overlaps Stripe 82 of the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey. We also present the measured SZ flux stacked on 52 X-ray-selected MCXC clusters that
fall within the ACT Equatorial region and an ACT Southern survey region covering 455 square degrees.
We find that the measured SZ flux from the X-ray-selected clusters is consistent with expectations.
However, we find that the measured SZ flux from the optically-selected clusters is both significantly
lower than expectations and lower than the recovered SZ flux measured by the Planck satellite. Since
we find a lower recovered SZ signal than Planck, we investigate the possibility that there is a significant
offset between the optically-selected brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and the SZ centers, to
which ACT is more sensitive due to its finer resolution. Such offsets can arise due to either an intrinsic
physical separation between the BCG and the center of the gas concentration or from misidentification
of the cluster BCG. We find that the entire discrepancy for both ACT and Planck can be explained by
assuming that the BCGs are offset from the SZ maxima with a uniform random distribution between 0
and 1.5 Mpc. Such large offsets between gas peaks and BCGs for optically-selected cluster samples
seem unlikely given that we find the physical separation between BCGs and X-ray peaks for an X-ray-selected
subsample of MaxBCG clusters to have a much narrower distribution that peaks within 0.2 Mpc. It is
possible that other effects are lowering the ACT and Planck signals by the same amount, with offsets
between BCGs and SZ peaks explaining the remaining difference between measurements. (Abridged)
