The effects of rotation on stellar evolution are particularly important at low metallicity, when
mass loss by stellar winds diminishes and the surface enrichment due to rotational mixing becomes
relatively more pronounced than at high metallicities. Here we investigate the impact of rotation
and metallicity on stellar evolution. Using a similar physics as in our previous large grids of models
at Z=0.002 and Z=0.014, we compute stellar evolution models with the Geneva code for rotating and
nonrotating stars with initial masses (Mini) between 1.7 and 120 Msun and Z=0.0004 (1/35 solar).
This is comparable to the metallicities of the most metal poor galaxies observed so far, such as I
Zw 18. Concerning massive stars, both rotating and nonrotating models spend most of their core-helium
burning phase with an effective temperature higher than 8000 K. Stars become red supergiants only
at the end of their lifetimes, and few RSGs are expected. Our models predict very few to no classical
Wolf-Rayet stars as a results of weak stellar winds at low metallicity. The most massive stars end
their lifetimes as luminous blue supergiants or luminous blue variables, a feature that is not predicted
by models with higher metallicities. Interestingly, due to the behavior of the intermediate convective
zone, the mass domain of stars producing pair-instability supernovae is smaller at Z=0.0004 than
at Z=0.002. We find that during the main sequence phase, the ratio between nitrogen and carbon abundances
(N/C) remains unchanged for nonrotating models. However, N/C increases by factors of 10-20 in rotating
models at the end of the MS. Cepheids coming from stars with Mini > 4-6 Msun are beyond the core helium
burning phase and spend little time in the instability strip. Since they would evolve towards cooler
effective temperatures, these Cepheids should show an increase of the pulsation period as a function
of age.
