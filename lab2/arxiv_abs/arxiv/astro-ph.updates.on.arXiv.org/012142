Population studies of the extragalactic objects are a major part of the universe large-scale structure
study. Apart from radio, infrared, and visible wavelength bands, observations and further identification
of extragalactic objects such as galaxies, quasars, blazers, liners, and active star burst regions
are also conducted in the X-ray and gamma bands. In this paper we make identification and cross-correlate
of the infrared and X-ray observational data, build a distribution of a selected sample sources
by types and attempted to analyze types of the extragalactic objects at distances up to z = 0.1 using
observational data of relevant space observatories. Data from a leading X-ray space observatory
XMM-Newton were used to compile the largest catalog of X-ray sources. Current version of XMM SSC
(Serendipitous Source Catalog) contains more than half a million sources. In our previous works
we selected and analyzed a sample of 5021 X-ray galaxies observed by XMM-Newton. Identification
and classification of these sources is essential next step of the study. In this study we used infrared
apparent magnitudes from WISE catalog of AGN candidates. In 2010 space telescope WISE performed
full sky survey in four infrared bands and detected 747 million sources. WISE catalog of AGN candidates
amounts 4 million of possible extragalactic sources. We built infrared color-color diagram for
our sample of X-ray galaxies and assessed their types using WISE telescope data. In this study we
also analyzed large scale structure of the universe (distances up to z=0.1). This analysis revealed
Coma galaxy cluster and SDSS Sloan Great Wall. In the further studies we are planning to investigate
the distribution of different types of X-ray galaxies within the large-scale structures of the
Universe.
