Thanks to the recent wide-area photometric surveys, the number of star cluster candidates have
risen exponentially in the last few years. Most detections, however, are based only on the presence
of an overdensity of stars in a given region, or an overdensity of variable stars, regardless of their
distance. As candidates, their detection has not been dynamically confirmed. Therefore, it is
currently unknown how many, and which ones, of the published candidates, are true clusters, and
which ones are chance alignments. We present a method to detect and confirm star clusters based on
the spatial distribution, coherence in motion and appearance on the color-magnitude diagram.
We explain and apply it to one new star cluster, and several candidate star clusters published in
the literature. The presented method is based on data from the Second Data Release of Gaia complemented
with data from the VISTA Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea survey for the innermost bulge regions.
It consists of a nearest neighbors algorithm applied simultaneously over spatial coordinates,
star color, and proper motions, in order to detect groups of stars that are close in the sky, move coherently
and define narrow sequences in the color-magnitude diagram, such as a young main sequence or a red
giant branch. When tested in the bulge area ($-10<\ell\ {\rm (deg)}<+10$; $-10<b\ {\rm (deg)}<+10$)
the method successfully recovered several known young and old star clusters. We report here the
detection of one new, likely old star cluster, while deferring the others to a forthcoming paper.
Additionally, the code has been applied to the position of 93 candidate star clusters published
in the literature. As a result, only two of them are confirmed as coherently moving groups of stars
at their nominal positions.
