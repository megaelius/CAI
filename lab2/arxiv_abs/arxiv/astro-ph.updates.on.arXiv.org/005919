We develop a dynamical theory for the origin of nuclear rings in barred galaxies. In analogy with
the standard theory of accretion discs, our theory is based on shear viscous forces among nested
annuli of gas. However, the fact that gas follows non circular orbits in an external barred potential
has profound consequences: instead of driving all the gas to the centre, viscosity creates a trapping
region where it is energetically favourable to form a stable ring which does not spread despite dissipation.
Our theory allows us to approximately predict the size of the ring given the underlying gravitational
potential. The size of the ring is loosely related to the location of the Inner Lindblad Resonance,
but the predicted location is more accurate and is also valid for strongly barred potentials. By
comparing analytical predictions with the results of hydrodynamical simulations, we find that
our theory provides a viable mechanism for ring formation if the effective sound speed of the gas
is low (cs<1km/s), but that nuclear spirals/shocks created by pressure destroy the ring when the
sound speed is high (cs<10km/s). We conclude that whether this mechanism for ring formation is relevant
for real galaxies ultimately depends on the effective equation of state of the ISM. Promising confirmation
comes from simulations in which the ISM is modelled using state-of-the-art cooling functions coupled
to live chemical networks, but more tests are needed regarding the role of turbulence driven by stellar
feedback. If the mechanism is relevant in real galaxies, it could provide a powerful tool to constrain
the gravitational potential, in particular the bar pattern speed.
