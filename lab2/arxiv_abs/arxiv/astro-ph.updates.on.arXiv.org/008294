Planetary migration is a major challenge for planet formation theories. The speed of Type I migration
is proportional to the mass of a protoplanet, while the final decade of growth of a pebble-accreting
planetary core takes place at a rate that scales with the mass to the two-thirds power. This results
in planetary growth tracks (i.e., the evolution of a protoplanet's mass versus its distance from
the star) that become increasingly horizontal (migration-dominated) with rising mass of the protoplanet.
It has been shown recently that the migration torque on a protoplanet is reduced proportional to
the relative height of the gas gap carved by the growing planet. Here we show from 1-D simulations
of planet-disc interaction that the mass at which a planet carves a 50% gap is approximately 2.3 times
the pebble isolation mass. Our measurements of the pebble isolation mass from 1-D simulations match
published 3-D results relatively well, except at very low viscosities where the 3-D pebble isolation
mass is significantly higher, possibly due to gap edge instabilities not captured in 1-D. The pebble
isolation mass demarks the transition from pebble accretion to gas accretion. Gas accretion to
form gas-giant planets therefore takes place over a few astronomical units of migration after reaching
first the pebble isolation mass and, shortly after, the 50% gap mass. Our results demonstrate how
planetary growth can outperform migration, both during core accretion and during gas accretion,
even when the Stokes number of the pebbles is small, St~0.01, and the pebble-to-gas flux ratio in
the protoplanetary disc is in the nominal range of 0.01-0.02. We find that planetary growth is very
rapid in the first million years of the protoplanetary disc and that the probability for forming
gas-giant planets increases with the initial size of the protoplanetary disc and with decreasing
turbulent diffusion.
