We investigate a possible correlation between the solid surface density $\Sigma$ of the minimum-mass
extrasolar nebulae (MMEN) and the host star mass $M_\star$ and metallicity [Fe/H]. Leveraging
on the precise host star properties from the California-{\it Kepler}-Survey (CKS), we found that
$\Sigma=$ 50^{+33}_{-20} \rm{~g~cm}^{-2} $(a/1AU)^{-1.75\pm0.07}$ $(M_\star/M_\odot)^{1.04\pm0.22}$
$10^{0.22\pm0.05{\rm [Fe/H]}}$ for {\it Kepler}-like systems (1-4$R_\oplus$; $a<$1AU). The
strong $M_\star$ dependence is reminiscent of previous dust continuum results that the solid disk
mass scales with $M_\star$. The weaker [Fe/H] dependence shows that sub-Neptune planets, unlike
giant planets, form readily in lower-metallicity environment. The innermost region ($a<$ 0.1AU)
of a MMEN maintains a smooth profile despite a steep decline of planet occurrence rate: a result that
favors the truncation of disks by co-rotating magnetospheres with a range of rotation periods,
rather than the sublimation of dusts. The $\Sigma$ of {\it Kepler} multi-transiting systems shows
a much stronger correlation with $M_\star$ and [Fe/H] than singles. This suggests that the dynamically
hot evolution that produced single systems also partially removed the memory of formation in disks.
Radial-velocity planets yielded a MMEN very similar to CKS planets; transit-timing-variation
planets' postulated convergent migration history is supported by their poorly constrained MMEN.
We found that lower-mass stars have a higher efficiency of forming/retaining planets: for sun-like
stars about 20\% of the solid mass within $\sim$1AU are converted/preserved as sub-Neptunes, compared
to 70\% for late-K-early-M stars. This may be due to the lower binary fraction, lower giant-planet
occurrence or the longer disk lifetime of lower-mass stars.
