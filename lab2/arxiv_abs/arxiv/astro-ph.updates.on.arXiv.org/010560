We develop forecast models of daily probability of major flares (M- and X-class) based on empirical
relationships between photospheric magnetic parameters and daily flaring rates from May 2010
to April 2018. In this study, we consider ten magnetic parameters characterizing size, distribution,
and non-potentiality of vector magnetic fields from Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) X-ray
flare data. The magnetic parameters are classified into three types: the total unsigned parameters,
the total signed parameters, and the mean parameters. We divide the data into two sets chronologically:
70% for training and 30% for testing. The empirical relationships between the parameters and flaring
rates are used to predict flare occurrence probabilities for a given magnetic parameter value.
Major results of this study are as follows. First, major flare occurrence rates are well correlated
with ten parameters having correlation coefficients above 0.85. Second, logarithmic values of
flaring rates are well approximated by linear equations. Third, the total unsigned and signed parameters
achieved better performance for predicting flares than the mean parameters in terms of verification
measures of probabilistic and converted binary forecasts. We conclude that the total quantity
of non-potentiality of magnetic fields is crucial for flare forecasting among the magnetic parameters
considered in this study. When this model is applied for operational use, this model can be used using
the data of 21:00 TAI with a slight underestimation of 2 - 6.3%.
