We investigate various phenomenological schemes for the rapid generation of 3D mock galaxy catalogues
with a given power spectrum and bispectrum. We apply the fast bispectrum estimator \MODALLSS{}
to these mock galaxy catalogues and compare to $N$-body simulation data analysed with the halo-finder
\texttt{ROCKSTAR} (our benchmark data). We propose an assembly bias model for populating parent
halos with subhalos by using a joint lognormal-Gaussian probability distribution for the subhalo
occupation number and the halo concentration. This prescription enabled us to recover the benchmark
power spectrum from $N$-body simulations to within 1\% and the bispectrum to within 4\% across the
entire range of scales of the simulation. A small further boost adding an extra galaxy to all parent
halos above the mass threshold $M>2\times10^{14}\,h^{-1} M_\odot$ obtained a better than 1\%
fit to both power spectrum and bispectrum in the range $K/3<1.1\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, where $K=k_1+k_2+k_3$.
This statistical model should be applicable to fast dark matter codes, allowing rapid generation
of mock catalogues which simultaneously reproduce the halo power spectrum and bispectrum obtained
from $N$-body simulations. We also investigate alternative schemes using the Halo Occupation
Distribution (HOD) which depend only on halo mass, but these yield results deficient in both the
power spectrum (2\%) and the bispectrum (>4\%) at $k,K/3 \approx 0.2\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, with
poor scaling for the latter. Efforts to match the power spectrum by modifying the standard four-parameter
HOD model result in overboosting the bispectrum (with a 10\% excess). We also characterise the effect
of changing the halo profile on the power spectrum and bispectrum.
