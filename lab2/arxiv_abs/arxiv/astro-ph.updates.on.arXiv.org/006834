We present proper motion measurements of Bo\"{o}tes III, an enigmatic stellar satellite of the
Milky Way, utilizing data from the second data release of the Gaia mission. By selecting 15 radial
velocity confirmed members of Bo\"{o}tes III, along with a likely RR Lyrae member in the vicinity,
we measure an error weighted mean proper motion of $(\mu_{\alpha} \cos{\delta}, \mu_\delta) =
(-1.14, -0.98)\pm(0.18, 0.20)$ mas/yr. We select and present further stars that may be Bo\"{o}tes
III members based on their combined proper motion and position in the color magnitude diagram. We
caution against assigning membership to stars that are not confirmed spectroscopically, as we
demonstrate that there are contaminating stars from the disrupting globular cluster NGC 5466 in
the vicinity of the main body of Bo\"{o}tes III, but we note that our results are consistent with previous
Bo\"{o}tes III proper motion estimates that did not include spectroscopic members. Based on the
measured proper motion and other known properties of Bo\"{o}tes III, we derive its Galactocentric
velocity and compute its orbit given canonical Milky Way potentials with halo masses of both 0.8$\times$10$^{12}$
M$_{\odot}$ and 1.6$\times$10$^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$. These orbits robustly show that Bo\"{o}tes
III passed within $\sim$12 kpc of the Galactic center on an eccentric orbit roughly 140 Myr ago. Additionally,
the proper motion of Bo\"{o}tes III is in excellent agreement with predictions for the retrograde
motion of the coincident Styx stellar stream. Given this, along with the small pericenter and metallicity
spread of Bo\"{o}tes III itself, we suggest that it is a disrupting dwarf galaxy giving rise to the
Styx stellar stream.
