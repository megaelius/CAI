Observations of mixed modes in evolved low-mass stars enable us to probe the properties of not only
the outer envelope of these stars, but also their deep layers. Among the seismic parameters associated
with mixed modes, the gravity offset, denoted with $\varepsilon_{\rm g}$, is expected to reveal
information on the boundaries of the inner buoyancy resonant cavity. This parameter was recently
measured for hundreds of stars observed by the Kepler satellite and its value was shown to change
during the evolution on the red giant branch. In this article, we theoretically investigate the
reasons for such a variation in terms of structure properties. Using available asymptotic analyses
and a simple model of the Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a and Lamb frequencies, we derived an analytical expression
of $\varepsilon_{\rm g}$ for dipolar modes and compared its predictions to observations. First,
we show that the asymptotic value of $\varepsilon_{\rm g}$ well agrees with the mean value observed
at the beginning of the ascent of the red giant branch, which results from the high density contrast
between the helium core and the base of the convective envelope. Second, we demonstrate that the
predicted value also explains the sharp decrease in $\varepsilon_{\rm g}$ observed for the more
luminous red giant stars of the sample. This rapid drop turns out to occur just before the luminosity
bump and result from the kink of the Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency near the upper turning point
associated with the buoyancy cavity as stars evolve and this latter becomes close to the base of the
convective envelope.The observed variation in $\varepsilon_{\rm g}$ and its link with the internal
properties on the red giant branch are now globally understood. This motivates further analyses
of the potential of this parameter as a seismic diagnosis of the region located between the helium
core and the convective envelope.
