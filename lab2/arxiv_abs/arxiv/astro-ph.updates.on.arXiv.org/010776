We use Gaia DR2 astrometric and line-of-sight velocity information combined with two sets of distances
obtained with a Bayesian inference method to study the 3D velocity distribution in the Milky Way
disc. We search for variations in all Galactocentric cylindrical velocity components ($V_{\phi}$,
$V_R$ and $V_z$) with Galactic radius, azimuth, and distance from the disc mid-plane. We confirm
recent work showing that bulk vertical motions in the $R\text{-}z$ plane are consistent with a combination
of breathing and bending modes. In the $x\text{-}y$ plane, we show that, although the amplitudes
change, the structure produced by these modes is mostly invariant as a function of distance from
the plane. Comparing to two different Galactic disc models, we demonstrate that the observed patterns
can drastically change in short time intervals, showing the complexity of understanding the origin
of vertical perturbations. A strong radial $V_R$ gradient was identified in the inner disc, transitioning
smoothly from $16$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ at an azimuth of $30^\circ<\phi<45^\circ$ ahead of the
Sun-Galactic centre line, to $-16$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ at an azimuth of $-45^\circ<\phi<-30^\circ$
lagging the solar azimuth. We use a simulation with no significant recent mergers to show that exactly
the opposite trend is expected from a barred potential, but overestimated distances can flip this
trend to match the data. Alternatively, using an $N$-body simulation of the Sagittarius dwarf-Milky
Way interaction, we demonstrate that a major recent perturbation is necessary to reproduce the
observations. Such an impact may have strongly perturbed the existing bar or even triggered its
formation in the last $1\text{-}2$ Gyr.
