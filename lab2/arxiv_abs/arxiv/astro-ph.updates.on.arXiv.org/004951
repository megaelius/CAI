Chameleon and symmetron theories serve as archetypal models for how light scalar fields can couple
to matter with gravitational strength or greater, yet evade the stringent constraints from classical
tests of gravity on Earth and in the Solar System. In this work, we investigate how a precision measurement
of the electron magnetic moment places meaningful constraints on both chameleons and symmetrons.
Two effects are identified: First, virtual chameleons and symmetrons run in loops to generate quantum
corrections to the intrinsic value of the magnetic moment; a common process widely considered in
the literature for many beyond-the-Standard-Model scenarios. A second effect, however, is unique
to scalar fields that exhibit screening. A scalar bubble-like profile forms inside the experimental
vacuum chamber and exerts a fifth force on the electron, leading to a systematic shift in the experimental
measurement. In quantifying this latter effect, we present a novel approach that combines analytic
arguments and a small number of numerical simulations to solve for the bubble-like profile quickly
for a large range of model parameters. Taken together, both effects yield interesting constraints
in complementary regions of parameter space. While the constraints we obtain for the chameleon
are largely uncompetitive with those in the existing literature, this still represents the tightest
constraint achievable yet from an experiment not originally designed to search for fifth forces.
We break more ground with the symmetron, for which our results exclude a large and previously unexplored
region of parameter space. Central to this achievement are the quantum correction terms, which
are able to constrain symmetrons with masses in the range $\mu \in [10^{-3.88},10^8]\,\text{eV}$,
whereas other experiments have hitherto only been sensitive to one or two orders of magnitude at
a time. [Abridged]
