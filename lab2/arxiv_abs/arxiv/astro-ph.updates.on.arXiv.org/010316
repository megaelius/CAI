The origin of the multi-band activities (outbursts/flares) of blazars is still a heavily debated
topic. Shock and magnetic reconnection have long been considered as possible triggers for the multi-band
activities. In this paper, we present an exploration of the origin of multi-band activities for
a high-redshift (z =1.8385) FSRQ PKS 1502+106. Utilizing multi-band data from radio to $\gamma$-ray
and optical polarization observations, we investigate two dramatic activities in detail: a $\gamma$-ray
dominated outburst in 2015 and an optical dominated outburst in 2017. Our main results are as follows.
(I) A fast $\gamma$-ray flare with a flux-doubling time-scale as short as 1-hr in 2015 is discovered.
Based on the variability time-scale, the physical parameters of the flaring region (e.g, minimum
Doppler factor, emission region size, etc.) are constrained. At the peak of the flare, the $\gamma$-ray
spectrum hardens to $\Gamma_{\gamma} = 1.82\pm0.04$ and exhibits an obvious curvature/break
characteristic that is caused by the typical "cooling break". Modelings of multi-band SEDs reveal
a very hard electronic energy spectrum with the electronic spectral index of $1.07\pm0.53$. This
result suggests that this fast $\gamma$-ray flare may be triggered by magnetic reconnection. (II)
During the outburst in 2017, the optical polarization degree and optical fluxes show a very tight
correlation. By analyzing Stokes parameters of polarization observations, our results show that
this outburst could be triggered by a transverse shock with a compression ratio of $\eta> 2.2$, and
the magnetic field intensity of the shock emission region is about $0.032$ G.
