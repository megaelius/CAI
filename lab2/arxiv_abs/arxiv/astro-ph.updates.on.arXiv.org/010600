Understanding disk dissipation is essential for studying how planets form. Disk gaps and holes,
which almost correspond to dust-free regions, are inferred from infrared observations of T Tauri
stars (TTS), indicating the existence of a transitional phase between thick accreting disks and
debris disks. Transition disks are usually referred to as candidates for newly formed planets.
We searched for transition disk candidates belonging to NGC 2264. We characterized accretion,
disk, and stellar properties of transition disk candidates and compared them to systems with a full
disk and diskless stars We modeled the spectral energy distribution (SED) of a sample of 401 TTS,
with Hyperion SED fitting code using photometric data from the U band to the MIPS band. We used the
SED modeling to distinguish transition disk candidates, full disk systems, and diskless stars.
We classified $52\%$ of the sample as full disk systems, $41\%$ as diskless stars, and $7\%$ of the
systems as transition disk candidates, among which seven systems are new transition disk candidates
belonging to the NGC 2264 cluster. The sample of transition disk candidates present dust in the inner
disk similar to anemic disks, according to the $\alpha_{IRAC}$ classification, which shows that
anemic disk systems can be candidate transition disks. We show that the presence of a dust hole in
the inner disk does not stop the accretion process since $82\%$ of transition disk candidates accrete
and show $H\alpha$, UV excess, and mass accretion rates at the same level as full disk systems. We
estimate the inner hole sizes, ranging from 0.1 to $78AU$, for the sample of transition disk candidates.
In only $18\%$ of the transition disk candidates, the hole size could be explained by X-ray photoevaporation
from stellar radiation.
