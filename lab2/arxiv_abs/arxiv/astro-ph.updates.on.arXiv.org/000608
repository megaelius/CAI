When a star comes within a critical distance to a supermassive black hole (SMBH), immense tidal forces
can remove a significant fraction of the star's mass, resulting in a stream of debris that falls back
onto the black hole and powers a luminous flare. In this paper, we perform two hydrodynamical simulations
of the disruption of a main-sequence star by a SMBH to characterize the evolution of the debris stream
after a tidal disruption. We demonstrate that this debris stream is confined by self-gravity in
the two directions perpendicular to the original direction of the star's travel, restricting its
width and height to be only a factor of a few larger than its original size. As a consequence, the stream
has a negligible surface area and makes almost no contribution to either the continuum or line emission.
We propose that any observed emission lines are not the result of photoionization in the unbound
debris, but are produced in the region above and below the forming elliptical accretion disk, the
same region in which the broad-line region is expected to be produced in steadily-accreting active
galactic nuclei. As each line within a broad-line region is observationally linked to a particular
location in the accretion disk, we suggest that the absence of a line indicates that the accretion
disk does not yet extend to the distance required to produce that line. This model can be used to understand
the spectral properties of the tidal disruption event PS1-10jh, for which HeII lines are observed,
but the Balmer series and HeI are not. Using a maximum likelihood analysis, we go on to show that a partial
disruption of a main-sequence star of near-solar composition can reproduce this event. [abridged]
