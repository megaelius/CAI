Coherent searches for persistent gravitational radiation from nonpulsating neutron stars in
young supernova remnants (SNRs) are computationally challenging because of rapid stellar braking.
We describe a practical, semi-coherent alternative to such searches based on a hidden Markov model
(HMM) tracking scheme, solved by the Viterbi algorithm, combined with a maximum likelihood matched
filter, the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic. The scheme is well suited to analyzing data from advanced
detectors like the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO).
It searches all the available data in a given observing run by incoherently combining the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic
outputs from coherent segments of duration $T_{\rm drift}$, increasing the total observation
time $T_{\rm obs}$ from days to $\sim$1 yr with fixed computing cost. One implementation tracks
the signal frequency and its first time derivative, improving the sensitivity from a $T_{\rm drift}$-restricted
coherent search by a factor $\sim (T_{\rm obs}/T_{\rm drift})^{1/4}$ and reducing the computing
cost by a factor $\sim (T_{\rm obs}/T_{\rm drift})^3$ compared to a fully coherent search over $T_{\rm
obs}$. A second implementation, tracking signal frequency alone, is less sensitive (the 95% confidence
strain sensitivity $h_0^{95\%}$ increases by a factor of $\lesssim 2$) than the first for targets
younger than $\sim 5$ kyr. It is faster than the first implementation by a factor $\sim {f_0}_{\rm
max}T_{\rm drift}^2$, where ${f_0}_{\rm max}$ is the maximum search frequency. Both implementations
are expected to reach $h_0^{95\%} \approx 5\times 10^{-26}$ with $T_{\rm obs}=1$ yr at Advanced
LIGO's design sensitivity. The second implementation can also readily track stochastic timing
noise intrinsic to the neutron star.
