In this paper we probe the hot, post-shock gas component of quasar-driven winds through the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. Combining datasets from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, the
$\textit{Herschel}$ Space Observatory, and the Very Large Array, we measure average spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) of 109,829 optically-selected, radio quiet quasars from 1.4~GHz
to 3000~GHz in six redshift bins between $0.3<z<3.5$. We model the emission components in the radio
and far-infrared, plus a spectral distortion from the tSZ effect. At $z>1.91$, we measure the tSZ
effect at $3.8\sigma$ significance with an amplitude corresponding to a total thermal energy of
$3.1\times10^{60}$ ergs. If this energy is due to virialized gas, then our measurement implies
quasar host halo masses are $\sim6\times10^{12}~h^{-1}$M$_\odot$. Alternatively, if the host
dark matter halo masses are $\sim2\times10^{12}~h^{-1}$M$_\odot$ as some measurements suggest,
then we measure a $>$90 per cent excess in the thermal energy over that expected due to virialization.
If the measured SZ effect is primarily due to hot bubbles from quasar-driven winds, we find that $(5^{+1.2}_{-1.3}$)
per cent of the quasar bolometric luminosity couples to the intergalactic medium over a fiducial
quasar lifetime of 100 Myr. An additional source of tSZ may be correlated structure, and further
work is required to separate the contributions. At $z\leq1.91$, we detect emission at 95 and 148~GHz
that is in excess of thermal dust and optically thin synchrotron emission. We investigate potential
sources of this excess emission, finding that CO line emission and an additional optically thick
synchrotron component are the most viable candidates.
