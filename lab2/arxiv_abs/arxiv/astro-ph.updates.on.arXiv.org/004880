Hot subdwarfs (sdO/Bs) are the helium-burning cores of red giants, which lost almost all of their
hydrogen envelopes. This mass loss is often triggered by common envelope interactions with close
stellar or even substellar companions. Cool companions like late-type stars or brown dwarfs are
detectable via characteristic light curve variations like reflection effects and often also eclipses.
To search for such objects we obtained multi-band light curves of 26 close sdO/B binary candidates
from the MUCHFUSS project with the BUSCA instrument. We discovered a new eclipsing reflection effect
system ($P=0.168938$~d) with a low-mass M dwarf companion ($0.116 M_{\rm \odot}$). Three more
reflection effect binaries found in the course of the campaign were already published, two of them
are eclipsing systems, in one system only showing the reflection effect but no eclipses the sdB primary
is found to be pulsating. Amongst the targets without reflection effect a new long-period sdB pulsator
was discovered and irregular light variations were found in two sdO stars. The found light variations
allowed us to constrain the fraction of reflection effect binaries and the substellar companion
fraction around sdB stars. The minimum fraction of reflection effect systems amongst the close
sdB binaries might be greater than 15\% and the fraction of close substellar companions in sdB binaries
might be as high as $8.0\%$. This would result in a close substellar companion fraction to sdB stars
of about 3\%. This fraction is much higher than the fraction of brown dwarfs around possible progenitor
systems, which are solar-type stars with substellar companions around 1 AU, as well as close binary
white dwarfs with brown dwarf companions. This might be a hint that common envelope interactions
with substellar objects are preferentially followed by a hot subdwarf phase.
