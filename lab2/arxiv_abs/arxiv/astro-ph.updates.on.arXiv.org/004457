We report the detection of the pulsed signal of the radio-quiet magnetar-like pulsar PSR J1846-0258
in the high-energy \gr-ray data of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi LAT). We produced phase-coherent
timing models exploiting RXTE PCA and Swift XRT monitoring data for the post- (magnetar-like) outburst
period from 2007 August 28 to 2016 September 4, with independent verification using INTEGRAL ISGRI
and Fermi GBM data. Phase-folding barycentric arrival times of selected Fermi LAT events from PSR
J1846-0258, resulted in a 4.2 sigma detection (30--100 MeV) of a broad pulse consistent in shape
and aligned in phase with the profiles that we measured with Swift XRT (2.5--10 keV), INTEGRAL ISGRI
(20--150 keV) and Fermi GBM (20--300 keV). The pulsed flux (30--100 MeV) is (3.91 +/- 0.97)E-9 photons/(cm^2
s MeV). Declining significances of the INTEGRAL ISGRI 20--150 keV pulse profiles suggest fading
of the pulsed hard X-ray emission during the post-outburst epochs. We revisited with greatly improved
statistics the timing and spectral characteristics of PSR B1509-58 as measured with the Fermi LAT.
The broad-band pulsed emission spectra (from 2 keV up to GeV energies) of PSR J1846-0258 and PSR B1509-58
can be accurately described with similarly curved shapes, with maximum luminosities at 3.5 +/-
1.1 MeV (PSR J1846-0258) and 2.23 +/- 0.11 MeV (PSR B1509-58). We discuss possible explanations
for observational differences between Fermi LAT detected pulsars that reach maximum luminosities
at GeV energies, like the second magnetar-like pulsar PSR J1119-6127, and pulsars with maximum
luminosities at MeV energies, which might be due to geometric differences rather than exotic physics
in high-B fields.
