Sun-like and low-mass stars possess high temperature coronae and lose mass in the form of stellar
winds, driven by thermal pressure and complex magnetohydrodynamic processes. These magnetized
outflows probably do not significantly affect the star's structural evolution on the Main Sequence,
but they brake the stellar rotation by removing angular momentum, a mechanism known as magnetic
braking. Previous studies have shown how the braking torque depends on magnetic field strength
and geometry, stellar mass and radius, mass-loss rate, and the rotation rate of the star, assuming
a fixed coronal temperature. For this study we explore how different coronal temperatures can influence
the stellar torque. We employ 2.5D, axisymmetric, magnetohydrodynamic simulations, computed
with the PLUTO code, to obtain steady-state wind solutions from rotating stars with dipolar magnetic
fields. Our parameter study includes 30 simulations with variations in coronal temperature and
surface-magnetic-field strength. We consider a Parker-like (i.e. thermal-pressure-driven)
wind, and therefore coronal temperature is the key parameter determining the velocity and acceleration
profile of the flow. Since the mass loss rates for these types of stars are not well constrained, we
determine how torque scales for a vast range of stellar mass loss rates. Hotter winds lead to a faster
acceleration, and we show that (for a given magnetic field strength and mass-loss rate) a hotter
outflow leads to a weaker torque on the star. We derive new predictive torque formulae for each temperature,
which quantifies this effect over a range of possible wind acceleration profiles.
