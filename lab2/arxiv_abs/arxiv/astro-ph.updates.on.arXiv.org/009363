In clustered environments, stellar encounters can liberate planets from their host stars via close
encounters. Although the detection probability of planets suggests that the planet population
in open clusters resembles that in the field, only a few dozen planet-hosting stars have been discovered
in open clusters. We explore the survival rates of planets against stellar encounters in open clusters
similar to the Pleiades, Hyades, and Praesepe and embedded clusters. We performed a series of N-body
simulations of high-density and low-density open clusters, open clusters that grow via mergers
of subclusters, and embedded clusters. We semi-analytically calculated the survival rate of planets
in star clusters up to 1Gyr using relative velocities, masses, and impact parameters of intruding
stars. Less than 1.5% of close-in planets within 1 AU and at most 7% of planets with 1-10 AU are ejected
by stellar encounters in clustered environments after the dynamical evolution of star clusters.
If a planet population from 0.01-100 AU in an open cluster initially follows the probability distribution
function of exoplanets with semi-major axis ($a_p$) between 0.03-3 AU in the field discovered by
RV surveys, the PDF of surviving planets beyond ~10 AU in open clusters can be slightly modified to
$\propto a_p^{-0.76}$. The production rate of free-floating planets (FFPs) per star is 0.0096-0.18,
where we have assumed that all the stars initially have one giant planet with a mass of 1--13 MJ in a
circular orbit. The expected frequency of FFPs is compatible with the upper limit on that of FFPs
indicated by recent microlensing surveys. Our survival rates of planets in open clusters suggest
that planets within 10 AU around FGKM-type stars are rich in relatively-young (<~10-100 Myr for
open clusters and ~1-10 Myr for embedded clusters), less massive open clusters, which are promising
targets for planet searches.
