(Abridged) In General Relativity, the shadow cast by a black hole has a size that depends very weakly
on its spin or the orientation of the observer. The half opening angle of the shadow is always equal
to 5+-0.2 GM/Dc^2, where M is the mass of the black hole and D is its distance from the Earth. Therefore,
measuring the size of the shadow of a black hole of known mass-to-distance ratio and verifying whether
it is within the 4% predicted range constitutes a null hypothesis test of GR. We show that Sgr A* is
the optimal target for performing this test with the Event Horizon Telescope. We use the results
of monitoring of stellar orbits to show that the ratio M/D for Sgr A* is already known to an accuracy
of ~6%. We investigate our prior knowledge of the scattering screen towards Sgr A, the effects of
which will need to be corrected for in order for the black-hole shadow to appear sharp against the
background emission. We argue that, even though the properties of the scattering ellipse at longer
wavelengths are known to within ~3-20%, extrapolating them down to the 1.3 mm EHT requires further
theoretical work and a model for the wavelength dependence of the axis ratio and position angle in
the presence of anisotropic turbulence. Finally, we employ recent GRMHD simulations of the accretion
flow around Sgr A* to investigate the visibility and sharpness of the black-hole shadow, which will
determine the accuracy at which the GR test can be performed. We explore an edge detection scheme
and a pattern matching algorithm based on the Hough/Radon transform and demonstrate that the shadow
of the black hole at 1.3 mm can be localized, in principle, to within ~9%. All these results suggest
that our prior knowledge of the properties of the black hole, of the scattering broadening in the
interstellar medium, and of the accretion flow can only limit this GR test with EHT observations
of Sgr A* to <10%.
