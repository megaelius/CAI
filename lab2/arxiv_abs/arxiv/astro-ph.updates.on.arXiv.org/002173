We present a phenomenological modification of the standard perturbation theory prediction for
the bispectrum in redshift space that allow us to extend the model to mildly non-linear scales over
a wide range of redshifts, $z\leq1.5$. We test the regime of validity of this new approach with dark
matter particles and haloes with two different $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies, both consistent with
current data. We find that we can describe the bispectrum of dark matter particles with $\sim5\%$
accuracy for $k_i\lesssim0.10\,h/{\rm Mpc}$ at $z=0$, for $k_i\lesssim0.15\,h/{\rm Mpc}$ at
$z=0.5$, for $k_i\lesssim0.17\,h/{\rm Mpc}$ at $z=1.0$ and for $k_i\lesssim0.20\,h/{\rm Mpc}$
at $z=1.5$. We apply this new formula to recover the bias parameters, logarithmic growth rate $f$
and $\sigma_8$, by combining the redshift space power spectrum monopole and quadrupole with the
bispectrum monopole for both dark matter particles and haloes. We find that the combination of these
three statistics can break the degeneracy between $b_1$, $f$ and $\sigma_8$. For dark matter particles
the new model can be used to recover $f$ and $\sigma_8$ with $\sim1\%$ systematic accuracy. For dark
matter haloes we find that $f$ and $\sigma_8$ present larger systematic shifts, $\sim10\%$. The
systematic offsets arise because of limitations in the modelling of the interplay between bias
and redshift space distortions, and represent a limitation as the statistical errors of forthcoming
surveys reach this level. Conveniently, we find that these residual systematics are mitigated
for combinations of parameters. In particular, the quantity $f\sigma_8$ is still recovered with
$\sim1\%$ accuracy. The improvement on the modeling of the bispectrum presented in this paper will
be useful for extracting information from current and future galaxy surveys.
