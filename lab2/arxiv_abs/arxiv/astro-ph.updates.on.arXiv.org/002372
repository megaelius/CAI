The detection and atmospheric characterization of super-Earths is one of the major frontiers of
exoplanetary science. Currently, extensive efforts are underway to detect molecules, particularly
H2O, in super-Earth atmospheres. In the present work, we develop a systematic set of strategies
to identify and observe potentially H2O-rich super-Earths that provide the best prospects for
characterizing their atmospheres using existing instruments. Firstly, we provide analytic prescriptions
and discuss factors that need to be taken into account while planning and interpreting observations
of super-Earth radii and spectra. We discuss how observations in different spectral bandpasses
constrain different atmospheric properties of a super-Earth, including radius and temperature
of the planetary surface as well as the mean molecular mass, the chemical composition and thermal
profile of the atmosphere. In particular, we caution that radii measured in certain bandpasses
can induce biases in the interpretation of the interior compositions. Secondly, we investigate
the detectability of H2O-rich super-Earth atmospheres using the HST WFC3 spectrograph as a function
of the planetary properties and stellar brightness. We find that highly irradiated super-Earths
orbiting bright stars, such as 55 Cancri e, present better candidates for atmospheric characterization
compared to cooler planets such as GJ 1214b even if the latter orbit lower-mass stars. Besides being
better candidates for both transmission and emission spectroscopy, hotter planets offer higher
likelihood of cloud-free atmospheres which aid tremendously in the observation and interpretation
of spectra. Finally, we present case studies of two super-Earths, GJ 1214b and 55 Cancri e, using
available data and models of their interiors and atmospheres.
