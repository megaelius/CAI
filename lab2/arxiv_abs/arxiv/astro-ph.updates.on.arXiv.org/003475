We analyze the early X-Ray Flares in the GRB "flare-plateau-afterglow" (FPA) phase observed by
Swift-XRT. The FPA occurs only in one of the seven GRB subclasses: the Binary-driven Hypernovae
(BdHNe). This subclass consists of long GRBs with a carbon-oxygen core and a neutron star (NS) binary
companion as progenitors. The hypercritical accretion of the supernova (SN) ejecta on the NS can
lead to the gravitational collapse of the NS into a black hole. Consequently, a GRB emission with
isotropic energy $E_{iso}\gtrsim10^{52}$ erg, as well as the associated GeV emission and FPA phase,
are observable. Previous works had shown that Gamma-ray Spikes in the prompt emission occur at $\sim
10^{15}$-$10^{17}$ cm with Lorentz factor $\Gamma\sim10^{2}$-$10^{3}$. By a novel data analysis
we show that the time of occurrence, duration, luminosity and total energy of the X-ray Flares correlate
with $E_{iso}$. Crucial is the observation of a thermal emission in the X-ray Flares that we show
occurs at radii $\sim10^{12}$ cm with $\Gamma\lesssim 4$. These model independent observations
cannot be met by the "collapsar" model, postulating synchrotron and inverse Compton from a single
ultra relativistic jetted emission extending from the prompt to the late afterglow and GeV emission
phases. We show that in BdHNe a collision between the GRB and the SN ejecta occurs at $\simeq10^{10}$
cm reaching transparency at $\sim10^{12}$ cm with $\Gamma\lesssim4$. The agreement between the
thermal emission observations and these theoretically derived values validate our model and open
the possibility of testing each BdHN episode with the corresponding Lorentz $\Gamma$ factor.
