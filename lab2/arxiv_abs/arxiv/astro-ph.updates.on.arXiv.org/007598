The matter environment of galaxies is connected to the physics of galaxy formation and evolution.
Utilising galaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing as a direct probe, we map out the distribution of correlated
surface mass-density around galaxy pairs for different lens separations in the Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). We compare, for the first time, these so-called excess mass
maps to predictions provided by a recent semi-analytic model, which is implanted within the dark-matter
Millennium Simulation. We analyse galaxies with stellar masses between $10^9-10^{11}\,{\rm
M}_\odot$ in two photometric redshift bins, for lens redshifts $z\lesssim0.6$, focusing on pairs
inside groups and clusters. To allow us a better interpretation of the maps, we discuss the impact
of chance pairs, i.e., galaxy pairs that appear close to each other in projection only. Our tests
with synthetic data demonstrate that the patterns observed in the maps are essentially produced
by correlated pairs that are close in redshift ($\Delta z\lesssim5\times10^{-3}$). We also verify
the excellent accuracy of the map estimators. In an application to the galaxy samples in the CFHTLenS,
we obtain a $3\sigma-6\sigma$ significant detection of the excess mass and an overall good agreement
with the galaxy model predictions. There are, however, a few localised spots in the maps where the
observational data disagrees with the model predictions on a $\approx3.5\sigma$ confidence level.
Although we have no strong indications for systematic errors in the maps, this disagreement may
be related to the residual B-mode pattern observed in the average of all maps. Alternatively, misaligned
galaxy pairs inside dark matter halos or lensing by a misaligned distribution of the intra-cluster
gas might also cause the unanticipated bulge in the distribution of the excess mass between lens
pairs.
