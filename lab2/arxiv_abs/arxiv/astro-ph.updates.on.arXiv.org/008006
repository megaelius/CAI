The Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) is already revolutionising our understanding
of the Universe. However, ALMA is not yet equipped with all of its originally planned receiver bands,
which will allow it to observe over the full range of frequencies from 35-950 GHz accessible through
the Earth's atmosphere. In particular Band 2 (67-90 GHz) has not yet been approved for construction.
Recent technological developments in cryogenic monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC)
high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) amplifier and orthomode transducer (OMT) design provide
an opportunity to extend the originally planned on-sky bandwidth, combining ALMA Bands 2 and 3 into
one receiver cartridge covering 67-116 GHz. The IF band definition for the ALMA project took place
two decades ago, when 8 GHz of on-sky bandwidth per polarisation channel was an ambitious goal. The
new receiver design we present here allows the opportunity to expand ALMA's wideband capabilities,
anticipating future upgrades across the entire observatory. Expanding ALMA's instantaneous
bandwidth is a high priority, and provides a number of observational advantages, including lower
noise in continuum observations, the ability to probe larger portions of an astronomical spectrum
for, e.g., widely spaced molecular transitions, and the ability to scan efficiently in frequency
space to perform surveys where the redshift or chemical complexity of the object is not known a priori.
Wider IF bandwidth also reduces uncertainties in calibration and continuum subtraction that might
otherwise compromise science objectives. Here we provide an overview of the component development
and overall design for this wideband 67-116 GHz cryogenic receiver cartridge, designed to operate
from the Band 2 receiver cartridge slot in the current ALMA front end receiver cryostat.
