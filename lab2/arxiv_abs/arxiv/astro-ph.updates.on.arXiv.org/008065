A spectroscopic analysis of stellar spectra can be carried out using different approaches; different
methods, line lists, atomic parameters, solar abundances etc. The resulting atmospheric parameters
from these choices can vary beyond quoted uncertainties in the literature. Here we characterize
these differences by systematically comparing some of the commonly adopted ingredients; line
lists, equivalent width measurements and atomic parameters. High resolution and high signal-to-noise
spectroscopic data of one helium-core-burning red giant star in each of the three open clusters,
NGC6819, M67 and NGC188 have been obtained with the FIES spectrograph at the Nordic Optical Telescope.
The M67 target has been used to benchmark the analysis, as it is a well studied cluster with asteroseismic
data from the K2 mission. For the other two clusters we have obtained higher quality data than previously
analyzed, which allows us to establish their chemical composition more securely. Using a line by
line analysis, we tested several different combinations of line lists and programs to measure equivalent
widths of absorption lines to characterize systematic differences within the same spectroscopic
method. The obtained parameters for the benchmark star in M67 vary up to ~170 K in T_eff, ~0.4 dex in
log g and ~0.25 dex in [Fe/H] between the tested setups. Using the combination of equivalent width
measurement program and line list that best reproduce the inferred log g from asteroseismology,
we determined the atmospheric parameters for the three stars and securely established the chemical
composition of NGC6819 to be ~solar, [Fe/H]=-0.02+-0.01 dex. We have highlighted the significantly
different results obtained with different combinations of line lists, programs and atomic parameters,
which emphasize the importance of benchmark stars studied with several different methods to anchor
spectroscopic analyses.
