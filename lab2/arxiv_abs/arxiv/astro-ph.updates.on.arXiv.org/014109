Stellar variability is driven by a multitude of internal physical processes that depend on fundamental
stellar properties. These properties are our bridge to reconciling stellar observations with
stellar physics, and for understanding the distribution of stellar populations within the context
of galaxy formation. Numerous ongoing and upcoming missions are charting brightness fluctuations
of stars over time, which encode information about physical processes such as rotation period,
evolutionary state (such as effective temperature and surface gravity), and mass (via asteroseismic
parameters). Here, we explore how well we can predict these stellar properties, across different
evolutionary states, using only photometric time series data. To do this, we implement a convolutional
neural network, and with data-driven modeling we predict stellar properties from light curves
of various baselines and cadences. Based on a single quarter of \textit{Kepler} data, we recover
stellar properties, including surface gravity for red giant stars (with an uncertainty of $\lesssim$
0.06 dex), and rotation period for main sequence stars (with an uncertainty of $\lesssim$ 5.2 days,
and unbiased from $\approx$5 to 40 days). Shortening the \textit{Kepler} data to a 27-day TESS-like
baseline, we recover stellar properties with a small decrease in precision, $\sim$0.07 dex for
log $g$ and $\sim$5.5 days for $P_{\rm rot}$, unbiased from $\approx$5 to 35 days. Our flexible data-driven
approach leverages the full information content of the data, requires minimal feature engineering,
and can be generalized to other surveys and datasets. This has the potential to provide stellar property
estimates for many millions of stars in current and future surveys.
