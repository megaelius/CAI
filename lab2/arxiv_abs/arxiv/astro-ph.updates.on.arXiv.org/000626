We study fundamental properties of steady, spherically symmetric, isothermal galactic outflow
in appropriate gravitational potential models. We aim at constructing a universal scale free theory
not only for galactic winds, but also for winds from clusters/groups of galaxies. In particular,
we consider effects of mass-density distribution on the formation of transonic galactic outflows
under several models of the density distribution profile predicted by cosmological simulations
of structure formation based on the cold dark matter (CDM) scenario. In this study, we have clarified
that there exists two types of transonic solutions: outflows from the central region and from distant
region with a finite radius, depending upon the density distribution of the system. The system with
sufficiently steep density gradient at the center is allowed to have the transonic outflows from
the center. The resultant criterion intriguingly indicates that the density gradient at the center
must be steeper than that of the prediction of conventional CDM model including Navarro, Frenk &
White (1997) and Moore et al. (1999). This result suggests that an additional steeper density distribution
originated by baryonic systems such as the stellar component and/or the central massive black hole
is required to realize transonic outflow from the central region. On the other hand, we predict the
outflow, which is started at the outskirts of the galactic center and is slowly-accelerated without
any drastic energy injection like starburst events. These transonic outflows may contribute secularly
to the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium.
