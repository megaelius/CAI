Most stars form in a clustered environment. Both single and binary stars will sometimes encounter
planetary systems in such crowded environments. Encounter rates for binaries may be larger than
for single stars, even for binary fractions as low as 10-20 per cent. In this work, we investigate
scatterings between a Sun-Jupiter pair and both binary and single stars as in young clusters. We
first perform a set of simulations of encounters involving wide ranges of binaries and single stars,
finding that wider binaries have larger cross sections for the planet's ejection. Secondly, we
consider such scatterings in a realistic population, drawing parameters for the binaries and single
stars from the observed population. The scattering outcomes are diverse, including ejection,
capture/exchange and collision. The binaries are more effective than single stars by a factor of
several or more in causing the planet's ejection and collision. Hence, in a cluster, as long as the
binary fraction is larger than about 10 per cent, the binaries will dominate the scatterings in terms
of these two outcomes. For an open cluster of a stellar density 50 pc$^{-3}$, a lifetime 100 Myr and
a binary fraction 0.5, we estimate that of the order of 1 per cent of the Jupiters are ejected, 0.1 per
cent collide with a star, 0.1 per cent change ownership and 10 per cent of the Sun-Jupiter pairs acquire
a stellar companion during scatterings. These companions are typically 1000s of au distant and
in half of the cases (so 5 per cent of all Sun-Jupiter pairs), they can excite the planet's orbit through
Kozai--Lidov mechanism before stripped by later encounters. Our result suggests that the Solar
System may have once had a companion in its birth cluster.
