High contrast imaging enables the determination of orbital parameters for substellar companions
(planets, brown dwarfs) from the observed relative astrometry and the estimation of model and age-dependent
masses from their observed magnitudes or spectra. Combining astrometric positions with radial
velocity gives direct constraints on the orbit and on the dynamical masses of companions. A brown
dwarf was discovered with the VLT/SPHERE instrument in 2017, which orbits at $\sim$ 11 au around
HD 206893. Its mass was estimated between 12 and 50 $M_{Jup}$ from evolutionary models and its photometry.
However, given the significant uncertainty on the age of the system and the peculiar spectrophotometric
properties of the companion, this mass is not well constrained. We aim at constraining the orbit
and dynamical mass of HD 206893 B. We combined radial velocity data obtained with HARPS spectra and
astrometric data obtained with the high contrast imaging VLT/SPHERE and VLT/NaCo instruments,
with a time baseline less than three years. We then combined those data with astrometry data obtained
by Hipparcos and Gaia with a time baseline of 24 years. We used a MCMC approach to estimate the orbital
parameters and dynamical mass of the brown dwarf from those data. We infer a period between 21 and
33{\deg} and an inclination in the range 20-41{\deg} from pole-on from HD 206893 B relative astrometry.
The RV data show a significant RV drift over 1.6 yrs. We show that HD 206893 B cannot be the source of
this observed RV drift as it would lead to a dynamical mass inconsistent with its photometry and spectra
and with Hipparcos and Gaia data. An additional inner (semimajor axis in the range 1.4-2.6 au) and
massive ($\sim$ 15 $M_{Jup}$) companion is needed to explain the RV drift, which is compatible with
the available astrometric data of the star, as well as with the VLT/SPHERE and VLT/NaCo nondetection.
