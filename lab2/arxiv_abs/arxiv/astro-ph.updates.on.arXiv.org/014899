Observations of ultra-hot Jupiters indicate the existence of thermal inversion in their atmospheres
with day-side temperatures greater than 2200 K. Various physical mechanisms such as non-local
thermal equilibrium, cloud formation, disequilibrium chemistry, ionisation, hydrodynamic
waves and associated energy, have been omitted in previous spectral retrievals while they play
an important role on the thermal structure of their upper atmospheres.We aim at exploring the atmospheric
properties of WASP-19b to understand its largely featureless thermal spectra using a state-of-the-art
atmosphere code that includes a detailed treatment of the most important physical and chemical
processes at play in such atmospheres.We used the one-dimensional line-by-line radiative transfer
code PHOENIX in its spherical symmetry configuration including the BT-Settl cloud model and C/O
disequilibrium chemistry to analyse the observed thermal spectrum of WASP-19b. Results. We find
evidence for a thermal inversion in the day-side atmosphere of the highly irradiated ultra-hot
Jupiter WASP-19b with Teq ~ 2700 K. At these high temperatures we find that H2O dissociates thermally
at pressure below 10^-2 bar. The inverted temperature-pressure profiles of WASP-19b show the evidence
of CO emission features at 4.5 micron in its secondary eclipse spectra.We find that the atmosphere
ofWASP-19b is thermally inverted.We infer that the thermal inversion is due to the strong impinging
radiation. We show that H2O is partially dissociated in the upper atmosphere above about tau = 10^-2,
but is still a significant contributor to the infrared-opacity, dominated by CO. The high-temperature
and low-density conditions cause H2O to have a flatter opacity profile than in non-irradiated brown
dwarfs.Altogether these factors makes H2O more difficult to identify in WASP-19b.
