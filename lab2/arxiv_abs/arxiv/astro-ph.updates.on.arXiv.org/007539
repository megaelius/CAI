We present the results of the largest $L^{\prime}$ ($3.8~\mu$m) direct imaging survey for exoplanets
to date, the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) Exozodi Exoplanet Common Hunt (LEECH).
We observed 98 stars with spectral types from B to M. Cool planets emit a larger share of their flux
in $L^{\prime}$ compared to shorter wavelengths, affording LEECH an advantage in detecting low-mass,
old, and cold-start giant planets. We emphasize proximity over youth in our target selection, probing
smaller physical separations than other direct imaging surveys. For FGK stars LEECH outperforms
many previous studies, placing tighter constraints on the hot-start planet occurrence frequency
interior to $\sim20$ AU. For less luminous, cold-start planets, LEECH provides the best constraints
on giant-planet frequency interior to $\sim20$ AU around FGK stars. Direct imaging survey results
depend sensitively on both the choice of evolutionary model (e.g., hot or cold-start) and assumptions
(explicit or implicit) about the shape of the underlying planet distribution, in particular its
radial extent. Artificially low limits on the planet occurrence frequency can be derived when the
shape of the planet distribution is assumed to extend to very large separations, well beyond typical
protoplanetary dust-disk radii ($\lesssim50$ AU), and when hot-start models are used exclusively.
We place a conservative upper limit on the planet occurrence frequency using cold-start models
and planetary population distributions that do not extend beyond typical protoplanetary dust-disk
radii. We find that $\lesssim90\%$ of FGK systems can host a 7 to 10 $M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ planet from
5 to 50 AU. This limit leaves open the possibility that planets in this range are common.
