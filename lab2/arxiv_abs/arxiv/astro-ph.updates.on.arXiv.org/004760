We present early laboratory simulations and extensive on-sky tests validating of the performance
of a shaped pupil coronagraph (SPC) behind an extreme-AO corrected beam of the Subaru Coronagraphic
Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) system. In tests with the SCExAO internal source/wavefront error
simulator, the normalized intensity profile for the SPC degrades more slowly than for the Lyot coronagraph
as low-order aberrations reduce the Strehl ratio from extremely high values (S.R. $\sim$ 0.93--0.99)
to those characteristic of current ground-based extreme AO systems (S.R. $\sim$ 0.74--0.93) and
then slightly lower values down to S.R. $\sim$ 0.57. On-sky SCExAO data taken with the SPC and other
coronagraphs for brown dwarf/planet-hosting stars HD 1160 and HR 8799 provide further evidence
for the SPC's robustness to low-order aberrations. From H-band Strehl ratios of 80% to 70%, the Lyot
coronagraph's performance vs. that of the SPC may degrade even faster on sky than is seen in our internal
source simulations. The 5-$\sigma$ contrast also degrades faster (by a factor of two) for the Lyot
than the SPC. The SPC we use was designed as a technology demonstrator only, with a contrast floor,
throughput, and outer working angle poorly matched for SCExAO's current AO performance and poorly
tuned for imaging the HR 8799 planets. Nevertheless, we detect HR 8799 cde with SCExAO/CHARIS using
the SPC in broadband mode, where the S/N for planet e is within 30% of that obtained using the vortex
coronagraph. The shaped-pupil coronagraph is a promising design demonstrated to be robust in the
presence of low-order aberrations and may be well-suited for future ground and space-based direct
imaging observations, especially those focused on follow-up exoplanet characterization and
technology demonstration of deep contrast within well-defined regions of the image plane.
