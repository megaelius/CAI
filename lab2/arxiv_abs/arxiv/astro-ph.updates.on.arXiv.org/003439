Abridged: ATLASGAL is an unbiased 870 micron submillimetre survey of the inner Galactic plane.
It provides a large and systematic inventory of all massive, dense clumps in the Galaxy (>1000 Msun)
and includes representative samples of all embedded stages of high-mass star formation. Here we
present the first detailed census of the properties (velocities, distances, luminosities and
masses) and spatial distribution of a complete sample of ~8000 dense clumps located in the Galactic
disk. We derive highly reliable velocities and distances to ~97% of the sample and use mid- and far-infrared
survey data to develop an evolutionary classification scheme that we apply to the whole sample.
Comparing the evolutionary subsamples reveals trends for increasing dust temperatures, luminosities
and line-widths as a function of evolution indicating that the feedback from the embedded proto-clusters
is having a significant impact on the structure and dynamics of their natal clumps. We find 88\,per\,cent
are already associated with star formation at some level. We also find the clump mass to be independent
of evolution suggesting that the clumps form with the majority of their mass in-situ. We estimate
the statistical lifetime of the quiescent stage to be ~5 x 10^4 yr for clump masses ~1000 Msun decreasing
to ~1 x 10^4 yr for clump masses >10000 Msun. We find a strong correlation between the fraction of clumps
associated with massive stars and peak column density. The fraction is initially small at low column
densities but reaching 100\,per\,cent for column densities above 10^{23} cm^{-2}; there are no
clumps with column density clumps above this value that are not already associated with massive
star formation. All of the evidence is consistent with a dynamic view of star formation wherein the
clumps form rapidly and are initially very unstable so that star formation quickly ensues.
