We estimate total mass ($M_{500}$), intracluster medium (ICM) mass ($M_{\mathrm{ICM}}$) and
stellar mass ($M_{\star}$) in a Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) selected sample of 91 galaxy clusters
with masses $M_{500}\gtrsim2.5\times10^{14}M_{\odot}$ and redshift $0.2 < z < 1.25$ from the
2500 deg$^2$ South Pole Telescope SPT-SZ survey. The total masses $M_{500}$ are estimated from
the SZE observable, the ICM masses $M_{\mathrm{ICM}}$ are obtained from the analysis of $Chandra$
X-ray observations, and the stellar masses $M_{\star}$ are derived by fitting spectral energy
distribution templates to Dark Energy Survey (DES) $griz$ optical photometry and $WISE$ or $Spitzer$
near-infrared photometry. We study trends in the stellar mass, the ICM mass, the total baryonic
mass and the cold baryonic fraction with cluster mass and redshift. We find significant departures
from self-similarity in the mass scaling for all quantities, while the redshift trends are all statistically
consistent with zero, indicating that the baryon content of clusters at fixed mass has changed remarkably
little over the past $\approx9$ Gyr. We compare our results to the mean baryon fraction (and the stellar
mass fraction) in the field, finding that these values lie above (below) those in cluster virial
regions in all but the most massive clusters at low redshift. Using a simple model of the matter assembly
of clusters from infalling groups with lower masses and from infalling material from the low density
environment or field surrounding the parent halos, we show that the measured mass trends without
strong redshift trends in the stellar mass scaling relation could be explained by a mass and redshift
dependent fractional contribution from field material. Similar analyses of the ICM and baryon
mass scaling relations provide evidence for the so-called "missing baryons" outside cluster virial
regions.
