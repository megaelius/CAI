Long-duration, spectrally-soft Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are associated with Type Ic Core Collapse
(CC) Supernovae (SNe), and thus arise from the death of massive stars. In the collapsar model, the
jet launched by the central engine must bore its way out of the progenitor star before it can produce
a GRB. Most of these jets do not break out, and are instead "choked" inside the star, as the central-engine
activity time, $t_{\rm e}$, is not long enough. Modelling the long-soft GRB duration distribution
assuming a power-law distribution for their central-engine activity times, $\propto t_{\rm e}^{-\alpha}$
for $t_{\rm e}>t_{\rm b}$, we find a steep distribution ($\alpha\sim4$) and a typical GRB jet breakout
time of $t_{\rm b}\sim 60\text{ s}$ in the star's frame. The latter suggests the presence of a low-density,
extended envelope surrounding the progenitor star, similar to that previously inferred for low-luminosity
GRBs. Extrapolating the range of validity of this power law below what is directly observable, to
$t_{\rm e}<t_{\rm b}$, by only a factor of $\sim$4-5 produces enough events to account for all Type
Ib/c SNe. Such extrapolation is necessary to avoid fine-tuning the distribution of central engine
activity times with the breakout time, which are presumably unrelated. We speculate that central
engines launching relativistic jets may operate in all Type Ib/c SNe. In this case, the existence
of a common central engine would imply that (i) the jet may significantly contribute to the energy
of the SN; (ii) various observational signatures, like the asphericity of the explosion, could
be directly related to jet's interaction with the star.
