I describe a heuristic model where MOND dynamics emerge in a universe viewed as a nearly spherical
brane embedded in a higher-dimensional flat space. The brane, described by $\xi(\Omega)$, is of
density $\sigma$ ($\xi$ and $\Omega$ are the radial and angular coordinates in the embedding space).
The brane and matter -- confined to the brane and of density $\rho(\Omega)\ll\sigma$ -- are coupled
to a potential $\varepsilon(\xi)$. I restrict myself to shallow perturbations, $\xi(\Omega)=\ell_0+\zeta(\Omega)$,
$|\zeta|\ll\ell_0$. A balanced brane implies $\hat a_0\equiv\varepsilon'(\ell_0)\sim T/\sigma\ell_0$,
$T$ is the brane tension, yielding for the velocity of small brane perturbations $c^2\sim T/\sigma\sim
\ell_0\hat a_0$. But, $\hat a_0$ plays the role of the MOND acceleration constant in local gravitational
dynamics; so $\hat a_0\sim c^2/\ell_0$. What we, in the brane, perceive as the gravitational potential
is $\phi\equiv\varepsilon[\xi(\Omega)]\approx \phi_0+\hat a_0\zeta$. Aspects of MOND that
may emerge naturally as geometrical properties are: a. The special role of acceleration in MOND,
and why it is an acceleration, $a_0$, that marks the transition from the standard dynamics much above
$a_0$ to scale-invariant dynamics much below $a_0$. b. The intriguing connection of $a_0$ with
cosmology. c. The Newtonian limit corresponds to local departure $|\zeta|\ll\ell_0$; i.e., $\phi-\phi_0\sim
a_0\zeta\ll a_0\ell_0\sim c^2$ - whereas relativity enters when $|\zeta|\not\ll\ell_0$. The
model also opens new vistas for extension, e.g., it points to possible dependence of $a_0$ on $\phi$,
and to $a_0$ losing its status and meaning altogether in the relativistic regime. Nonlocal effects
that appear in the model dynamically might help solve the `old' cosmological-constant problem.
I discuss possible connections with the nearly-de-Sitter nature of our Universe. (Abridged.)
