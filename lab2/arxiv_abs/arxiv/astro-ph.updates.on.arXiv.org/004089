Observationally, supernovae (SNe) are divided into subclasses pertaining to their distinct characteristics.
This diversity reflects the diversity in the progenitor stars. It is not entirely clear how different
evolutionary paths leading massive stars to become a SN are governed by fundamental parameters
such as progenitor initial mass and metallicity. This paper places constraints on progenitor initial
mass and metallicity in distinct core-collapse SN subclasses, through a study of the parent stellar
populations at the explosion sites. Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) of 83 nearby SN explosion
sites with a median distance of 18 Mpc has been collected and analysed, enabling detection and spectral
extraction of the parent stellar population of SN progenitors. From the parent stellar population
spectrum, the initial mass and metallicity of the coeval progenitor are derived by means of comparison
to simple stellar population models and strong-line methods. Additionally, near-infrared IFS
was employed to characterise the star formation history at the explosion sites. No significant
metallicity differences are observed among distinct SN types. The typical progenitor mass is found
to be highest for SN Ic, followed by type Ib, then types IIb and II. SN IIn is the least associated with
young stellar populations and thus massive progenitors. However, statistically significant
differences in progenitor initial mass are observed only when comparing SNe IIn with other subclasses.
Stripped-envelope SN progenitors with initial mass estimate lower than 25~$M_\odot$ are found;
these are thought to be the result of binary progenitors. Confirming previous studies, these results
support the notion that core-collapse SN progenitors cannot arise from single-star channel only,
and both single and binary channels are at play in the production of core-collapse SNe. [ABRIDGED]
