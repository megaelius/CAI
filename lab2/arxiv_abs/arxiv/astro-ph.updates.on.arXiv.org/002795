To assess the effects of the cluster environment on the different components of the interstellar
medium, we analyse the FIR-submm properties of a sample of star-forming dwarf (SFD) galaxies detected
by the Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey (HeViCS). We determine dust masses and dust temperatures by
fitting a modified black body (MBB) function to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Stellar
and gas masses, star formation rates (SFRs), and metallicities are obtained from the analysis of
a set of ancillary data. Dust is detected in 49 out of 140 optically identified dwarfs covered by the
HeViCS field; considering only dwarfs brighter than $m_B$ = 18 mag, this gives a detection rate of
43%. After evaluating different emissivity indices, we find that the FIR-submm SEDs are best-fit
by $\beta$=1.5, with a median dust temperature $T_d$ = 22.4 K. Assuming $\beta$=1.5, 67% of the 23
galaxies detected in all five Herschel bands show emission at 500 $\mu$m in excess of the MBB model.
The excess is inversely correlated with SFR and stellar masses. To study the variations in the global
properties of our sample due to environmental effects, we compare the Virgo SFDs to other Herschel
surveys, such as KINGFISH, the Dwarf Galaxy Survey (DGS), and the HeViCS bright galaxy catalogue
(BGC). We explore the relations between stellar mass and HI fraction, specific SFR, dust fraction,
gas-to-dust ratio over a wide range of stellar masses. Highly HI-deficient Virgo dwarf galaxies
are mostly characterised by quenched star formation activity and lower dust fractions giving hints
for dust stripping in cluster dwarfs. However, we find that the fraction of dust removed has to be
less than that of the HI component. Since the Virgo SFDs are likely to be crossing the cluster for the
first time, a longer timescale might be necessary to strip the more centrally concentrated dust
distribution.
