We consider torsional Alfven waves which may be excited in Jupiter's metallic hydrogen region.
The axisymmetric zonal flow fluctuations have previously been examined for incompressible fluids
in the context of Earth's liquid iron core. Integrated theoretical models for the deep-seated Jovian
dynamo, implementing radial changes of density and electrical conductivity from the molecular
hydrogen envelope, have reproduced its strong, dipolar magnetic field. Adopting these models,
we find anelastic torsional waves which travel in cylindrical radius on timescales of several years,
or longer, in the metallic region. Being excited by the convection that is vigorous in the outer layers
of the dynamo region, they can propagate both inwards and outwards and be reflected at a magnetic
tangent cylinder, enabling a standing wave, or 'oscillation'. Identifying reflections in data
could determine the depth of the tangent cylinder and hence the equatorial radius of the metallic
region. Also, this may distinguish the Jovian torsional waves from those in Earth's core, where
observational evidence has suggested waves mainly travelling outwards from the rotation axis.
These waves can transport angular momentum and possibly give rise to variations in Jupiter's rotation
period of magnitude no greater than tens milliseconds. In addition those internal disturbances
may be revealed above the metallic region as changes in the zonal flow, with an amplitude of about
one tenth of that of the steady zonal jets. The Juno's gravity measurements have indicated that the
zonal flows visible at Jupiter's surface penetrate down to a depth of a few thousands of kilometres,
so torsional waves in the interior could imprint themselves as surface flow variations.
