The spectrum of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows can be studied with color indices. Here we present
a large comprehensive catalogue of 70 GRBs with multi-wavelength optical transient data on which
we perform a systematic study to find the temporal evolution of color indices. We categorize them
into two samples based on how well the color indices are evaluated. The Golden sample includes 25
bursts mostly observed by GROND, and the Silver sample includes 45 bursts observed by other telescopes.
For the Golden sample, we find that 95\% of the color indices do not vary over time. However, the color
indices do vary during short periods in most bursts. The observed variations are consistent with
effects of (i) the cooling frequency crossing the studied energy bands in a wind medium (43\%) and
in a constant density medium (30\%), (ii) early dust extinction (12\%), (iii) transition from reverse
shock to forward shock emission (5\%), or (iv) an emergent supernova emission (10\%). We also study
the evolutionary properties of the mean color indices for different emission episodes. We find
that 86\% of the color indices in the 70 bursts show constancy between consecutive ones. The color
index variations occur mainly during the late GRB-SN bump, the flare and early reversed-shock emission
components. We further perform a statistical analysis of various observational properties and
model parameters (spectral index $\beta_{o}^{\rm CI}$, electron spectral indices $p^{\rm CI}$,
etc.) using color indices. Overall, we conclude that $\sim$ 90\% of colors are constant in time and
can be accounted for by the simplest external forward shock model, while the varying color indices
call for more detailed modeling.
