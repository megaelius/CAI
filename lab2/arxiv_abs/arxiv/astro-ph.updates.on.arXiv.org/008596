We report molecular line observations of the massive protostellar source G339.88-1.26 with the
Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array. The observations reveal a highly collimated SiO
jet extending from the 1.3 mm continuum source, which connects to a slightly wider but still highly
collimated CO outflow. Rotational features perpendicular to the outflow axis are detected in various
molecular emissions, including SiO, SO2, H2S, CH3OH, and H2CO emissions. Based on their spatial
distributions and kinematics, we find that they trace different parts of the envelope-disk system.
The SiO emission traces the disk and inner envelope in addition to the jet. The CH3OH and H2CO emissions
mostly trace the infalling-rotating envelope, and are enhanced around the transition region between
envelope and disk, i.e., the centrifugal barrier. The SO2 and H2S emissions are enhanced around
the centrifugal barrier, and also trace the outer part of the disk. Envelope kinematics are consistent
with rotating-infalling motion, while those of the disk are consistent with Keplerian rotation.
The radius and velocity of the centrifugal barrier are estimated to be about 530 au and 6 km/s, leading
to a central mass of about 11 solar masses, consistent with estimates based on spectral energy distribution
fitting. These results indicate that an ordered transition from an infalling-rotating envelope
to a Keplerian disk through a centrifugal barrier, accompanied by changes of types of molecular
line emissions, is a valid description of this massive protostellar source. This implies that at
least some massive stars form in a similar way as low-mass stars via Core Accretion.
