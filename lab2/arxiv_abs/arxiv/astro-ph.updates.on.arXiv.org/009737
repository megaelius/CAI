The purpose of this work is to present an extensive grid of dynamical atmosphere and wind models for
M-type AGB stars, covering a wide range of relevant stellar parameters. We used the DARWIN code,
which includes frequency-dependent radiation-hydrodynamics and a time-dependent description
of dust condensation and evaporation, to simulate the dynamical atmosphere. The wind-driving
mechanism is photon scattering on submicron-sized Mg$_2$SiO$_4$ grains. The grid consists of
$\sim4000$ models, with luminosities from $L_\star=890\,{\mathrm{L}}_\odot$ to $L_\star=40000\,{\mathrm{L}}_\odot$
and effective temperatures from 2200K to 3400K. For the first time different current stellar masses
are explored with M-type DARWIN models, ranging from 0.75M$_\odot$ to 3M$_\odot$. The modelling
results are radial atmospheric structures, dynamical properties such as mass-loss rates and wind
velocities, and dust properties (e.g. grain sizes, dust-to-gas ratios, and degree of condensed
Si). We find that the mass-loss rates of the models correlate strongly with luminosity. They also
correlate with the ratio $L_*/M_*$: increasing $L_*/M_*$ by an order of magnitude increases the
mass-loss rates by about three orders of magnitude, which may naturally create a superwind regime
in evolution models. There is, however, no discernible trend of mass-loss rate with effective temperature,
in contrast to what is found for C-type AGB stars. We also find that the mass-loss rates level off at
luminosities higher than $\sim14000\,{\mathrm{L}}_\odot$, and consequently at pulsation periods
longer than $\sim800$ days. The final grain radii range from 0.25 micron to 0.6 micron. The amount
of condensed Si is typically between 10% and 40%, with gas-to-dust mass ratios between 500 and 4000.
