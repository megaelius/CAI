The thermodynamic relation between pressure and density (i.e.~the equation of state) of cold supranuclear
matter is critical in describing neutron stars, yet it remains one of the largest uncertainties
in nuclear physics. The extraction of tidal deformabilities from the gravitational waves emitted
in the coalescence of neutron star binaries, such as GW170817, is a promising tool to probe this thermodynamic
relation. Equation-of-state insensitive relations between symmetric and antisymmetric combinations
of individual tidal deformabilities, the so-called "binary Love relations", have proven important
to infer the radius of neutron stars, and thus constrain the equation of state, from such gravitational
waves. A similar set of relations between the moment of inertia, the tidal deformability, the quadrupole
moment, and the compactness of neutron stars, the so-called `I-Love-Q' and `C-Love' relations,
allow for future tests of General Relativity in the extreme gravity regime. But even the most insensitive
of such relations still presents some degree of equation-of-state variability that could introduce
systematic uncertainties in parameter extraction and in model selection. We here reduce this variability
by more than 50% by imposing a prior on the allowed set of equations of state, derived from the posteriors
generated from the analysis of GW170817. The resulting increase in insensitivity reduces systematic
uncertainties in the extraction of the tidal deformability from future gravitational wave observations,
although statistical uncertainties currently dominate the error budget, and will continue to
do so until the era of Voyager-class detectors.
