Jets and outflows are ubiquitous in the process of formation of stars since outflow is intimately
associated with accretion. Free-free (thermal) radio continuum emission is associated with these
jets. This emission is relatively weak and compact, and sensitive radio interferometers are required
to study it. Observations in the cm range are most useful to trace the base of the ionized jets, close
to the central protostar, where optical or near-IR imaging is made difficult by the high extinction
present. Radio recombination lines in jets (in combination with proper motions) should provide
their 3D kinematics at very small scale. Future instruments such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA)
and the Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) will be crucial to perform this kind of sensitive
observations. Thermal jets are associated with both high and low mass protostars and possibly even
with substellar objects. The ionizing mechanism of these radio jets appears to be related to shocks
in the associated outflows, as suggested by the observed correlation between the cm luminosity
and the outflow momentum rate. Some protostellar jets show indications of non-thermal emission
in their lobes. Linearly polarized synchrotron emission has been found in the jet of HH 80-81, allowing
one to map the jet magnetic field, a key ingredient to determine the collimation and ejection mechanisms.
As only a fraction of the emission is polarized, very sensitive observations such as those that will
be feasible with the interferometers previously mentioned are required to perform studies in a
large sample of sources. Jets are present in many kinds of astrophysical scenarios. Characterizing
radio jets in young stars, where thermal emission allows one to determine their physical conditions,
would also be useful in understanding acceleration and collimation mechanisms in all kinds of astrophysical
jets.
