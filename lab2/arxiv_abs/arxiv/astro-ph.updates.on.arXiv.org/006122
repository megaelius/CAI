The very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission reported from a number of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe)
is naturally explained by the inverse Compton scattering of multi-TeV electrons. However, the
physical dimensions of some gamma-ray-emitting PWNe significantly exceed the scales anticipated
by the standard hydrodynamical paradigm of PWN formation. The most "disturbing" case in this regard
is HESS J1825-137, which extends to distances $r\approx70\rm\,pc$ from the central pulsar PSR
J1826-1334. If the gamma-ray emission is indeed produced inside the PWN, but not by electrons that
escaped the nebula and diffuse in the interstellar medium (ISM), the formation of such an anomalously
extended plerion could be realized, in a diluted environment with the hydrogen number density $n_{ism}\le10^{-2}\rm\,cm^{-3}$.
In this paper, we explore an alternative scenario assuming that the pulsar responsible for the formation
of the nebula initially had a very short rotation period. In this case, the sizes of both the PWN and
the surrounding supernova remnant depend on the initial pulsar period, the braking index, and the
ISM density. To check the feasibility of this scenario, we study the parameter space that would reproduce
the size of HESS J1825-137. We show that this demand can be achieved if the braking index is small,
$n\leq2$ and the pulsar birth period is short, $P_{\rm b}\simeq1\rm\,ms$. This scenario can reproduce
the wind termination position, which is expected at $R_{ts}\simeq0.03\rm\,pc$, only in a dense
environment with $n_{ism}\geq\rm1\,cm^{-3}$. The requirement of the dense surrounding gas is
supported by the presence of molecular clouds found in the source vicinity.
