Context. Solar gravity modes (g modes) are buoyancy waves trapped in the solar radiative zone that
have been very difficult to detect at the surface. Solar g modes would complement solar pressure
modes (p modes) in probing the central regions of the Sun, for example the core rotation rate. Aims.
A detection of g modes using changes in the large frequency separation of p modes has recently been
reported. However, it is unclear how p and g modes interact. The aim of this study is to evaluate to
what extent g modes can perturb the frequencies of p modes. Methods. We computed the first-order
perturbation to global p-mode frequencies due to a flow field and perturbations to solar structure
caused by a g mode. We focused on long-period g modes and assumed that the g-mode perturbations are
constant in time. The surface amplitude of g modes is assumed to be $1$ mm s$^{-1}$, which is close
to the observational limit. Results. Gravity modes do perturb p-mode frequencies to first order
if the harmonic degree of the g mode is even and if its azimuthal order is zero. The effect is extremely
small. For dipole and quadrupole p modes, all frequency shifts are smaller than $0.1$ nHz, or $2\times10^{-8}$
in relative numbers. This is because the relative perturbation to solar structure quantities caused
by a g mode of realistic amplitude is of the order of $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-5}$. We find that structural
changes dominate over advection. Surprisingly, the interaction of g and p modes takes place to a
large part near the surface, where p modes spend most of their propagation times and g modes generate
the largest relative changes to solar structure. Conclusions. It appears to be impossible to detect
g modes solely through their signature in p-mode frequency shifts. Whether g modes leave a detectable
signature in p-mode travel times under a given observational setup remains an open question.
