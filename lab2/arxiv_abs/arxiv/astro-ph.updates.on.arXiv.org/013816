In the near future, extremely-large ground-based telescopes may conduct some of the first searches
for life beyond the solar system. High-spectral resolution observations of reflected light from
nearby exoplanetary atmospheres could be used to search for the biosignature oxygen. However,
while Earth's abundant O$_2$is photosynthetic, early ocean loss may also produce high atmospheric
O$_2$ via water vapor photolysis and subsequent hydrogen escape. To explore how to use spectra to
discriminate between these two oxygen sources, we generate high-resolution line-by-line synthetic
spectra of both a habitable Earth-like, and post-ocean-loss Proxima Centauri b. We examine the
strength and profile of four bands of O$_2$ from 0.63 to 1.27 $\mu$m, and quantify their relative
detectability. We find that 10 bar O$_2$ post-ocean-loss atmospheres have strong suppression
of oxygen bands, and especially the 1.27$\mu$m band. This suppression is due to additional strong,
broad O$_2$-O$_2$ collisionally-induced absorption (CIA) generated in these more massive O$_2$atmospheres,
which is not present for the smaller amounts of oxygen generated by photosynthesis. Consequently,
any detection of the 1.27$\mu$m band in reflected light indicates lower Earth-like O$_2$ levels,
which suggests a likely photosynthetic origin. However, the 0.69 $\mu$m O$_2$ band is relatively
unaffected by O$_2$-O$_2$ CIA, and the presence of an ocean-loss high-O$_2$ atmosphere could be
inferred via detection of a strong 0.69 $\mu$m O$_2$ band, and a weaker or undetected 1.27 $\mu$m
band. These results provide a strategy for observing and interpreting O$_2$ in exoplanet atmospheres,
that could be considered by future ground-based telescopes.
