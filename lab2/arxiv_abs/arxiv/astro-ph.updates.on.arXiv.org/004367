The X-ray narrow emission line region (NELR) of the archetypal Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC\,5548 has been
interpreted as a single-phase photoionized plasma that is absorbed by some of the warm absorber
components. This scenario requires those overlaying warm absorber components to have larger distance
(to the central engine) than the X-ray NELR, which is not fully consistent with the distance estimates
found in the literature. Therefore, we reanalyze the high-resolution spectra obtained in 2013--2014
with the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) aboard \textit{XMM}-Newton to provide an alternative
interpretation of the X-ray narrow emission features. We find that the X-ray narrow emission features
in NGC\,5548 can be described by a two-phase photoionized plasma with different ionization parameters
($\log \xi=1.3$ and $0.1$) and kinematics ($v_{\rm out}=-50$ and $-400~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$), and
no further absorption by the warm absorber components. The X-ray and optical NELR might be the same
multi-phase photoionized plasma. Both X-ray and optical NELR have comparable distances, asymmetric
line profiles, and the underlying photoionized plasma is turbulent and compact in size. The X-ray
NELR is not the counterpart of the UV/X-ray absorber outside the line of sight because their distances
and kinematics are not consistent. In addition, X-ray broad emission features that we find in the
spectrum can be accounted for by a third photoionized emission component. The RGS spectrum obtained
in 2016 is analyzed as well, where the luminosity of most prominent emission lines (the \ion{O}{vii}
forbidden line and \ion{O}{viii} Ly$\alpha$ line) are the same (at a 1 $\sigma$ confidence level)
as in 2013--2014.
