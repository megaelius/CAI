The Sun's spectrum varies with center-to-limb distance. This variation is governed by the underlying
temperature-density structure of the solar atmosphere. To explore the spectrally resolved center-to-limb
variation (CLV) we make use of two spectral atlases recorded with the Fourier transform spectrometer
(FTS) at the McMath-Pierce facility at Kitt Peak. One spectral atlas obtained 10 arcsec inside the
solar limb was recorded in 1978-79 as part of the first survey of the Second Solar Spectrum, while
the other atlas is the well used reference NSO/Kitt Peak FTS atlas for the disk center. Both atlases
represent fully resolved spectra without any spectral stray light. We then construct an atlas of
the limb/disk-center ratio between the two spectra over the wavelength range 4084-9950 \AA. This
ratio spectrum, which expresses the CLV amplitude relative to the continuum, is as richly structured
as the intensity spectrum itself, but the line profiles differ greatly in both shape and amplitude.
It is as if we are dealing with a new, unfamiliar spectrum of the Sun, distinctly different from both
the intensity spectrum (which we here refer to with the acronym SS1) and the linear polarization
of the Second Solar Spectrum (for which we use acronym SS2). In analogy we refer to the new ratio spectrum
as SS3. While there is hardly any resemblance between SS3 and SS2, we are able to identify a non-linear
mapping that can translate SS1 to SS3 in the case of weak to medium-strong spectral lines that are
mainly formed in LTE (being directly coupled to the local temperature-density structure). This
non-linear mapping is successfully modeled in terms of two free parameters that are found to vary
approximately linearly over the entire wavelength range covered. These parameters and the various
SS3 line profiles provide a novel, rich set of observational constraints on model atmospheres.
