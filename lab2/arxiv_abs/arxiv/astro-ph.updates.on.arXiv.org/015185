The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) is an extended gamma-ray source in the central region of the Galaxy
found in Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) data. One of the leading explanations for the GCE
is an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the Galactic bulge. Due to differing
star formation histories it is expected that the MSPs in the Galactic bulge are older and therefore
dimmer than those in the Galactic disk. Additionally, correlations between the spectral parameters
of the MSPs and the spin-down rate of the corresponding neutron stars have been observed. This implies
that the bulge MSPs may be spectrally different from the disk MSPs. We perform detailed modelling
of the MSPs from formation until observation. Although we confirm the correlations, we do not find
they are sufficiently large to significantly differentiate the spectra of the bulge MSPs and disk
MSPs when the uncertainties are accounted for. Our results demonstrate that the population of MSPs
that can explain the gamma-ray signal from the resolved MSPs in the Galactic disk and the unresolved
MSPs in the boxy bulge and nuclear bulge can consistently be described as arising from a common evolutionary
trajectory for some subset of astrophysical sources common to all these different environments.
We do not require that there is anything unusual about inner Galaxy MSPs to explain the GCE. Additionally,
we use a more accurate geometry for the distribution of bulge MSPs. We find that the elongated boxy
bulge morphology means that some the bulge MSPs are closer to us and so easier to resolve. We identify
three resolved MSPs that have significant probabilities of belonging to the bulge population.
