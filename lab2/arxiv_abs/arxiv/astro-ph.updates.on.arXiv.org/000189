(Abridged) AVOCADO aims at establishing firm conclusions on the formation and evolution of dwarf
galaxies by constructing and analysing a homogeneous, multiwavelength dataset for a statistically
significant sample of approximately 6500 nearby dwarfs (M_i > -18 mag). We present the sample
selection criteria and describe the suite of analysis tools, some of them developed in the framework
of the Virtual Observatory. We make use of optical spectra and UV-to-NIR imaging of the dwarf sample
to derive SFRs, stellar masses, ages and metallicities - which are further supplemented with structural
parameters that are used to classify them morphologically. This dataset, coupled with a detailed
characterisation of each dwarf's environment, allows for a fully comprehensive investigation
of their origins and to track the potential evolutionary paths between the different dwarf types.
We characterise the local environment of all dwarfs in our sample, paying special attention to trends
with current star formation activity. We find that virtually all quiescent dwarfs are located in
the vicinity (projected distances < 1.5 Mpc) of L* companions, consistent with recent results.
While star-forming dwarfs are preferentially found at separations of the order of 1 Mpc, there appears
to be a tail towards low separations (<100 kpc) in the distribution of projected distances. We
speculate that, modulo projection effects, this probably represents a genuine population of late-type
dwarfs caught upon first infall about their host and before environmental quenching has fully operated.
In this context, these results suggest that internal mechanisms -such as gas exhaustion via star
formation or feedback effects- are not sufficient to completely cease the star formation activity
in dwarf galaxies, and that becoming the satellite of a massive central galaxy appears to be a necessary
condition to create a quiescent dwarf.
