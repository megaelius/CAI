We derive infrared and radio flux densities of all ~1000 known Galactic HII regions in the Galactic
longitude range 17.5 < l < 65 degree. Our sample comes from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer
(WISE) catalog of Galactic \hii regions \citep{anderson2014}. We compute flux densities at six
wavelengths in the infrared (GLIMPSE 8 microns, WISE 12 microns and 22 microns, MIPSGAL 24 microns,
and Hi-GAL 70 microns and 160 microns) and two in the radio (MAGPIS 20 cm and VGPS 21 cm). All HII region
infrared flux densities are strongly correlated with their ~20 cm flux densities. All HII regions
used here, regardless of physical size or Galactocentric radius, have similar infrared to radio
flux density ratios and similar infrared colors, although the smallest regions ($r<1\,$pc), have
slightly elevated IR to radio ratios. The colors $\log_{10}(F_{24 micron}/F_{12 micron}) \ge
0$ and $\log_{10}(F_{70 micron}/F_{12 micron}) \ge 1.2$, and $\log_{10}(F_{24 micron}/F_{12
micron}) \ge 0$ and $\log_{10}(F_{160 micron}/F_{70 micron}) \le 0.67$ reliably select HII regions,
independent of size. The infrared colors of ~22$\%$ of HII regions, spanning a large range of physical
sizes, satisfy the IRAS color criteria of \citet{wood1989} for HII regions, after adjusting the
criteria to the wavelengths used here. Since these color criteria are commonly thought to select
only ultra-compact HII regions, this result indicates that the true ultra-compact HII region population
is uncertain. Comparing with a sample of IR color indices from star-forming galaxies, HII regions
show higher $\log_{10}(F_{70 micron}/F_{12 micron})$ ratios. We find a weak trend of decreasing
infrared to ~20 cm flux density ratios with increasing $R_{gal}$, in agreement with previous extragalactic
results, possibly indicating a decreased dust abundance in the outer Galaxy.
