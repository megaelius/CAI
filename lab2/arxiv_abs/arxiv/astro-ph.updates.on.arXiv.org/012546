Methanol ice is embedded in interstellar ice mantles present in dense molecular clouds. We aim to
measure the sputtering efficiencies starting from different ice mantles of varying compositions
experimentally, in order to evaluate their potential impact on astrochemical models. The sputtering
yields of complex organic molecules is of particular interest, since few mechanisms are efficient
enough to induce a significant feedback to the gas phase. We irradiated methanol and carbon dioxide
ice mixtures of varying ratios with swift heavy ions in the electronic sputtering regime. We monitored
the evolution of the infrared spectra and the species released to the gas phase with a mass spectrometer.
Methanol and 13C-methanol isotopologue were used to remove any ambiguity on the measured irradiation
products. The sputtering of methanol embedded in carbon dioxide ice is an efficient process leading
to the ejection of intact methanol in the gas phase. We establish that when methanol is embedded in
a carbon-dioxide-rich mantle exposed to cosmic rays, a significant fraction is sputtered as intact
molecules. The sputtered fraction follows the time-dependent bulk composition of the ice mantle,
the latter evolving with time due to the radiolysis-induced evolution of the bulk. If methanol is
embedded in a carbon dioxide ice matrix, as the analyses of the spectral shape of the CO2 bending mode
observations in some lines of sight suggest, the overall methanol sputtering yield is higher than
if embedded in a water ice mantle. The sputtering is increased by a factor close to the dominant ice
matrix sputtering yield, which is about six times higher for pure carbon dioxide ice when compared
to water ice. These experiments are further constraining the cosmic-ray-induced ice mantle sputtering
mechanisms important role in the gas-phase release of complex organic molecules from the interstellar
solid phase.
