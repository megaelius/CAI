The $\gamma$-ray flare of PKS 1222+216, observed in June 2010, is interpreted as an outcome of jet
dynamics at recollimation zone. We obtained the $\gamma$-ray light-curves in three different
energy bands, namely, 100--300 MeV, 300 MeV--1 GeV and 1--3 GeV from observations by the \emph{Fermi}
Large Area Telescope (LAT). We also use the \emph{Swift}--XRT flux from 0.3--10 keV obtained from
archival data. We supplement these with the 0.07--0.4 TeV observations with MAGIC telescope, available
in the literature. The detection of source at very high energy (VHE, $E>100$ GeV) with a differential
photon spectral index of $2.7\pm0.3$ and the rapid variability associated with it suggests that
the emission arises from a compact region located beyond the broad line emitting region. The plausible
$\gamma$-ray emission mechanism can then be inverse Compton scattering of IR photons from obscuring
torus. Further, the decay time of LAT flare cannot be explained by considering simple radiative
loss mechanisms. Hence, to interpret the LAT light curves, we develop a model where the broadband
emission originates from a compact region, arising plausibly from the compression of jet matter
at the recollimation zone. The flare is then expressed as an outcome of jet deceleration probably
associated with this focusing effect. The parameters of the model are further constrained by reproducing
the broadband spectral energy distribution of the source obtained during the flare episode. Our
study suggests that the particle energy density exceeds magnetic energy density by a large factor
which in turn may cause rapid expansion of the emission region. However, near equipartition can
be achieved towards the end of LAT flare during which the compact emission region would have expanded
to the size of jet cross-section.
