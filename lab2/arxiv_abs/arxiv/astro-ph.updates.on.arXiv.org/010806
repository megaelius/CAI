The analysis of the wavelength-dependent albedo of exoplanets represents a direct way to provide
insight of their atmospheric composition and to constrain theoretical planetary atmosphere modelling.
Wavelength-dependent albedo can be inferred from the exoplanet's reflected light of the host star,
but this is not a trivial task. In fact, the planetary signal may be several orders of magnitude lower
($10^{-4}$ or below) than the flux of the host star, thus making its extraction very challenging.
Successful detection of the planetary signature of 51~Peg\,b has been recently obtained by using
cross-correlation function (CCF) or autocorrelation function (ACF) techniques. In this paper
we present an alternative method based on the use of Independent Component Analysis (ICA). In comparison
to the above-mentioned techniques, the main advantages of ICA are that the extraction is \textit{"blind"}
i.e. it does not require any \textit{a priori} knowledge of the underlying signals, and that our
method allows us not only to detect the planet signal but also to estimate its wavelength dependence.
To show and quantify the effectiveness of our method we successfully applied it to both simulated
data and real data of an eclipsing binary star system. Eventually, when applied to real 51~Peg~+~51~Peg\,b
data, our method extracts the signal of 51~Peg but we could not soundly detect the reflected spectrum
of 51~Peg\,b mainly due to the insufficient $SNR$ of the input composite spectra. Nevertheless,
our results show that with "ad-hoc" scheduled observations an ICA approach will be, in perspective,
a very valid tool for studying exoplanetary atmospheres.
