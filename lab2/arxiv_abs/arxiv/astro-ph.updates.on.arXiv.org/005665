We present thermal phase curve measurements for the hot Jupiter WASP-103b observed with Hubble/WFC3
and Spitzer/IRAC. The phase curves have large amplitudes and negligible hotspot offsets, indicative
of poor heat redistribution to the nightside. We fit the phase variation with a range of climate maps
and find that a spherical harmonics model generally provides the best fit. The phase-resolved spectra
are consistent with blackbodies in the WFC3 bandpass, with brightness temperatures ranging from
$1880\pm40$ K on the nightside to $2930 \pm 40$ K on the dayside. The dayside spectrum has a significantly
higher brightness temperature in the Spitzer bands, likely due to CO emission and a thermal inversion.
The inversion is not present on the nightside. We retrieved the atmospheric composition and found
the composition is moderately metal-enriched ($\mathrm{[M/H]} = 23^{+29}_{-13}\times$ solar)
and the carbon-to-oxygen ratio is below 0.9 at $3\,\sigma$ confidence. In contrast to cooler hot
Jupiters, we do not detect spectral features from water, which we attribute to partial H$_2$O dissociation.
We compare the phase curves to 3D general circulation models and find magnetic drag effects are needed
to match the data. We also compare the WASP-103b spectra to brown dwarfs and young directly imaged
companions and find these objects have significantly larger water features, indicating that surface
gravity and irradiation environment play an important role in shaping the spectra of hot Jupiters.
These results highlight the 3D structure of exoplanet atmospheres and illustrate the importance
of phase curve observations for understanding their complex chemistry and physics.
