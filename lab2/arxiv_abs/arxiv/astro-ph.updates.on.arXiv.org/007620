We present the reconstruction of hydrostatic mass profiles in 13 X-ray luminous galaxy clusters
that have been mapped in their X-ray and SZ signal out to $R_{200}$ for the XMM-Newton Cluster Outskirts
Project (X-COP). Using profiles of the gas temperature, density and pressure that have been spatially
resolved out to (median value) 0.9 $R_{500}$, 1.8 $R_{500}$, and 2.3 $R_{500}$, respectively,
we are able to recover the hydrostatic gravitating mass profile with several methods and using different
mass models. The hydrostatic masses are recovered with a relative (statistical) median error of
3% at $R_{500}$ and 6% at $R_{200}$. By using several different methods to solve the equation of the
hydrostatic equilibrium, we evaluate some of the systematic uncertainties to be of the order of
5% at both $R_{500}$ and $R_{200}$. A Navarro-Frenk-White profile provides the best-fit in nine
cases out of 13, with the remaining four cases that do not show a statistically significant tension
with it. The distribution of the mass concentration follows the correlations with the total mass
predicted from numerical simulations with a scatter of 0.18 dex, with an intrinsic scatter on the
hydrostatic masses of 0.15 dex. We compare them with the estimates of the total gravitational mass
obtained through X-ray scaling relations applied to $Y_X$, gas fraction and $Y_{SZ}$, and from
weak lensing and galaxy dynamics techniques, and measure a substantial agreement with the results
from scaling laws, from WL at both $R_{500}$ and $R_{200}$ (with differences below 15%), from cluster
velocity dispersions, but a significant tension with the caustic masses that tend to underestimate
the hydrostatic masses by 40% at $R_{200}$. We also compare these measurements with predictions
from alternative models to the Cold Dark Matter, like the "Emergent Gravity" and MOND scenarios.
