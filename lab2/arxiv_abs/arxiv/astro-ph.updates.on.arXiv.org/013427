"Ly$\alpha$ nebulae" are giant ($\sim$100 kpc), glowing gas clouds in the distant universe. The
origin of their extended Ly$\alpha$ emission remains a mystery. Some models posit that Ly$\alpha$
emission is produced when the cloud is photoionized by UV emission from embedded or nearby sources,
while others suggest that the Ly$\alpha$ photons originate from an embedded galaxy or AGN and are
then resonantly scattered by the cloud. At least in the latter scenario, the observed Ly$\alpha$
emission will be polarized. To test these possibilities, we are conducting imaging polarimetric
observations of seven Ly$\alpha$ nebulae. Here we present our results for LABd05, a cloud at $z$
= 2.656 with an obscured, embedded AGN to the northeast of the peak of Ly$\alpha$ emission. We detect
significant polarization. The highest polarization fractions $P$ are $\sim$10-20% at $\sim$20-40
kpc southeast of the Ly$\alpha$ peak, away from the AGN. The lowest $P$, including upper-limits,
are $\sim$5% and lie between the Ly$\alpha$ peak and AGN. In other words, the polarization map is
lopsided, with $P$ increasing from the Ly$\alpha$ peak to the southeast. The measured polarization
angles $\theta$ are oriented northeast, roughly perpendicular to the $P$ gradient. This unique
polarization pattern suggests that 1) the spatially-offset AGN is photoionizing nearby gas and
2) escaping Ly$\alpha$ photons are scattered by the nebula at larger radii and into our sightline,
producing tangentially-oriented, radially-increasing polarization away from the photoionized
region. Finally we conclude that the interplay between the gas density and ionization profiles
produces the observed central peak in the Ly$\alpha$ emission. This also implies that the structure
of LABd05 is more complex than assumed by current theoretical spherical or cylindrical models.
