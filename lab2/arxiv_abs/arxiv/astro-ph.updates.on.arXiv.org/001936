We quantify to what extent tidal erosion of globular clusters (GCs) has contributed to the observed
u-shaped relation between GC specific frequencies S_N and host galaxy luminosity M_V. We used our
MUESLI code to calculate GC survival rates for typical early-type galaxy potentials covering a
wide range of observed galaxy properties. We do this for isotropic and radially anisotropic GC velocity
distributions. We find that the calculated GC survival fraction, f_s, depends linearly on the logarithm
of the 3D mass density, rho_3D, within the galaxy's half light radius, with f_s proportional to (rho_3D)^(-0.17).
For a given galaxy, survival rates are lower for radially anisotropic configurations than for the
isotropic GC cases. We apply these relations to a literature sample of 219 early-type galaxies from
Harris et al. (2013) in the range M_V=[-24.5:-15.5] mag. The expected GC survival fraction ranges
from ~50% for the most massive galaxies with the largest radii to ~10% for the most compact galaxies.
We find that intermediate luminosity galaxies M_V=[-20.5:-17.5] mag have the strongest expected
GC erosion. Within the considered literature sample, the predicted GC survival fraction therefore
defines a u-shaped relation with M_V, similar to the relation between specific frequency S_N and
M_V. As a consequence, the u-shape of S_N vs. M_V gets erased almost entirely when correcting the
S_N values for the effect of GC erosion. We conclude that tidal erosion is an important contributor
to the u-shaped relation between GC specific frequency and host galaxy luminosity. It must be taken
into account when inferring primordial star cluster formation efficiencies from observations
of GC systems in the nearby universe.
