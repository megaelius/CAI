Atmospheric haze is the leading candidate for the flattening of expolanetary spectra, as it's also
an important source of opacity in the atmospheres of solar system planets, satellites, and comets.
Exoplanetary transmission spectra, which carry information about how the planetary atmospheres
become opaque to stellar light in transit, show broad featureless absorption in the region of wavelengths
corresponding to spectral lines of sodium, potassium and water. We develop a detailed atomistic
model, describing interactions of atomic or molecular radiators with dust and atmospheric haze
particulates. This model incorporates a realistic structure of haze particulates from small nano-size
seed particles up to sub-micron irregularly shaped aggregates, accounting for both pairwise collisions
between the radiator and haze perturbers, and quasi-static mean field shift of levels in haze environments.
This formalism can explain large flattening of absorption and emission spectra in haze atmospheres
and shows how the radiator - haze particle interaction affects the absorption spectral shape in
the wings of spectral lines and near their centers. The theory can account for nearly all realistic
structure, size and chemical composition of haze particulates and predict their influence on absorption
and emission spectra in hazy environments. We illustrate the utility of the method by computing
shift and broadening of the emission spectra of the sodium D line in an argon haze. The simplicity,
elegance and generality of the proposed model should make it amenable to a broad community of users
in astrophysics and chemistry.
