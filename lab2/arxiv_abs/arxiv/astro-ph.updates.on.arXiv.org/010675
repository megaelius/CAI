Stars stripped of their envelopes from interaction with a binary companion emit a significant fraction
of their radiation as ionizing photons. They are potentially important stellar sources of ionizing
radiation, however, they are still often neglected in spectral synthesis simulations or simulations
of stellar feedback. We modeled the radiative contribution from stripped stars by using detailed
evolutionary and spectral models. We estimated their impact on the integrated spectra and specifically
on the emission rates of HI-, HeI-, and HeII-ionizing photons from stellar populations. We find
that stripped stars have the largest impact on the ionizing spectrum of a population in which star
formation halted several Myr ago. In such stellar populations, stripped stars dominate the emission
of ionizing photons, mimicking a younger stellar population in which massive stars are still present.
Our models also suggest that stripped stars have harder ionizing spectra than massive stars. The
additional ionizing radiation affects observable properties that are related to the ionizing
emission from stellar populations. In co-eval stellar populations, the ionizing radiation from
stripped stars increases the ionization parameter and the production efficiency of HI-ionizing
photons. They also cause high values for these parameters for about ten times longer than what is
predicted for massive stars. The hard ionizing radiation from stripped stars likely introduces
a characteristic ionization structure of the nebula, which leads to the emission of highly ionized
elements such as O$^{2+}$ and C$^{3+}$. We, therefore, expect that the presence of stripped stars
affects the location in the BPT diagram and the diagnostic ratio of OIII to OII nebular emission lines.
Our models are publicly available through CDS database and on the Starburst99 website.
