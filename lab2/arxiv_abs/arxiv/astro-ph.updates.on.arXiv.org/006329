We use spatially resolved two-dimensional stellar velocity maps over a $107"\times 107"$ field
of view to investigate the kinematic features of 90 early-type galaxies above stellar mass $10^{11.5}M_\odot$
in the MASSIVE survey. We measure the misalignment angle $\Psi$ between the kinematic and photometric
axes and identify local features such as velocity twists and kinematically distinct components.
We find 46% of the sample to be well aligned ($\Psi < 15^{\circ}$), 33% misaligned, and 21% without
detectable rotation (non-rotators). Only 24% of the sample are fast rotators, the majority of which
(91%) are aligned, whereas 57% of the slow rotators are misaligned with a nearly flat distribution
of $\Psi$ from $15^{\circ}$ to $90^{\circ}$. 11 galaxies have $\Psi \gtrsim 60^{\circ}$ and thus
exhibit minor-axis ("prolate") rotation in which the rotation is preferentially around the photometric
major axis. Kinematic misalignments occur more frequently for lower galaxy spin or denser galaxy
environments. Using the observed misalignment and ellipticity distributions, we infer the intrinsic
shape distribution of our sample and find that MASSIVE slow rotators are consistent with being mildly
triaxial, with mean axis ratios of $b/a=0.88$ and $c/a=0.65$. In terms of local kinematic features,
51% of the sample exhibit kinematic twists of larger than $20^{\circ}$, and 2 galaxies have kinematically
distinct components. The frequency of misalignment and the broad distribution of $\Psi$ reported
here suggest that the most massive early-type galaxies are mildly triaxial, and that formation
processes resulting in kinematically misaligned slow rotators such as gas-poor mergers occur
frequently in this mass range.
