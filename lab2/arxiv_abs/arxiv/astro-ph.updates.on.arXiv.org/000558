The presence of gaseous giant planets whose orbits lie in extreme proximity to their host stars ("hot
Jupiters"), can largely be accounted for by planetary migration, associated with viscous evolution
of proto-planetary nebulae. Recently, observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect during
planetary transits have revealed that a considerable fraction of detected hot Jupiters reside
on orbits that are misaligned with respect to the spin-axes of their host stars. This observational
fact has cast significant doubts on the importance of disk-driven migration as a mechanism for production
of hot Jupiters, thereby reestablishing the origins of close-in planetary orbits as an open question.
Here we show that misaligned orbits can be a natural consequence of disk migration. Our argument
rests on an enhanced abundance of binary stellar companions in star formation environments, whose
orbital plane is uncorrelated with the spin axes of the individual stars. We analyze the dynamical
evolution of idealized proto-planetary disks under perturbations from massive distant bodies
and demonstrate that the resulting gravitational torques act to misalign the orbital planes of
the disks relative to the spin poles of their host stars. As a result, we predict that in the absence
of strong disk-host star angular momentum coupling or sufficient dissipation that acts to realign
the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbits, the fraction of planetary systems (including systems
of hot Neptunes and Super-Earths), whose angular momentum vectors are misaligned with respect
to their host-stars should be commensurate with the rate of primordial stellar multiplicity.
