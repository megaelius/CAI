Over the past two decades, the most commonly adopted explanation for high and hard X-ray emission
in resolved quasar jets has been inverse Compton upscattering of the Cosmic Microwave Background
(IC/CMB), which requires jets which remain highly relativistic on 10-1000 kpc scales. In more recent
years various lines of observational evidence, including gamma-ray upper limits, have disfavored
this explanation in favor of a synchrotron origin. While the IC/CMB model generally predicts a high
level of gamma-ray emission, it has never been detected. Here we report the detection of a low-state
Fermi/LAT gamma-ray spectrum associated with two jetted AGN which is consistent with the predictions
of the IC/CMB model for their X-ray emission. We have used archival multiwavelength observations
to make precise predictions for the expected minimum flux in the GeV band, assuming that the X-ray
emission from the kpc-scale jet is entirely due to the IC/CMB process. In both sources -- OJ 287 and
PKS 1510-089 -- the minimum-detected gamma-ray flux level agrees with predictions. Both sources
exhibit extreme superluminal proper motions relative to their jet power, which argues for the well-aligned
jets required by the IC/CMB model. In the case of PKS~1510-089, it cannot be ruled out that the minimum
gamma-ray flux level is due to a low state of the variable core which only matches the IC/CMB prediction
by chance. Continued long-term monitoring with the Fermi/LAT could settle this issue by detecting
a plateau signature in the recombined light-curve which would clearly signal the presence of a non-variable
emission component.
