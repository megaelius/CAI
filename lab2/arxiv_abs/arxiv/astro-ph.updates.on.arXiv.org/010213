Using the Continuum HAloes in Nearby Galaxies - an EVLA Survey (CHANG-ES) radio continuum data from
the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in two frequency bands (C-band, L-band), we analyzed the
radio properties, including polarization and the transport processes of the CR electrons (CREs),
in the edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 4013. Supplementary LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) data at 150MHz
are used to study the low-frequency properties of this galaxy and X-ray (Chandra, XMM-Newton) data
are used to investigate the central region. The central point source dominates the radio continuum
in both CHANG-ES bands, but no clear AGN classification is possible at this time. The scale height
analysis shows that Gaussian fits, with halo scale heights of 1.2 kpc in C-band, 2.0 kpc in L-band,
and 3.1 kpc at 150 MHz, better represent the intensity profiles than do exponential fits. The radio
continuum halo of NGC 4013 in C-band is rather small, while the low-frequency LOFAR data reveal a
large halo. The polarization data reveal plane-parallel, regular magnetic fields within the entire
disk and vertical halo components out to heights of about 6 kpc indicating the presence of an axisymmetric
field having a radial component pointing outwards. The mean magnetic field strength of the disk
of NGC 4013 of 6.6 $\mu$G (using the revised equipartition formula) is rather small. The interaction
and the low star formation rate (SFR) across the disk of NGC 4013 probably influence the appearance
of its radio continuum. Several observable quantities give consistent evidence that the CR transport
in the halo of NGC 4013 is diffusive: the frequency dependence of the synchrotron scale height, the
disk/halo flux density ratio, the vertical profile of the synchrotron spectral index, the small
propagation speed measured modeled with spinnaker, and the low temperature of the X-ray emitting
hot gas.
