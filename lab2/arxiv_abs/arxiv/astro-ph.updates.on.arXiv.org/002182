Here we report on Swift and Suzaku observations near the end of an outburst from the black hole transient
4U 1630-47 and Chandra observations when the source was in quiescence. 4U 1630-47 made a transition
from a soft state to the hard state ~50 d after the main outburst ended. During this unusual delay,
the flux continued to drop, and one Swift measurement found the source with a soft spectrum at a 2-10
keV luminosity of L = 1.07e35 erg/s for an estimated distance of 10 kpc. While such transients usually
make a transition to the hard state at L/Ledd = 0.3-3%, where Ledd is the Eddington luminosity, the
4U 1630-47 spectrum remained soft at L/Ledd = 0.008/M10% (as measured in the 2-10 keV band), where
M10 is the mass of the black hole in units of 10 solar masses. An estimate of the luminosity in the broader
0.5-200 keV bandpass gives L/Ledd = 0.03/M10%, which is still an order of magnitude lower than typical.
We also measured an exponential decay of the X-ray flux in the hard state with an e-folding time of
3.39+/-0.06 d, which is much less than previous measurements of 12-15 d during decays by 4U 1630-47
in the soft state. With the ~100 ks Suzaku observation, we do not see evidence for a reflection component,
and the 90% confidence limits on the equivalent width of a narrow iron Kalpha emission line are <40
eV for a narrow line and <100 eV for a line of any width, which is consistent with a change of geometry
(either a truncated accretion disk or a change in the location of the hard X-ray source) in the hard
state. Finally, we report a 0.5-8 keV luminosity upper limit of <2e32 erg/s in quiescence, which
is the lowest value measured for 4U 1630-47 to date.
