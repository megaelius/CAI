SS 433 is a binary system containing a supergiant star that is overflowing its Roche lobe with matter
accreting onto a compact object (either a black hole or neutron star). Two jets of ionized matter
with a bulk velocity of $\sim0.26c$ extend from the binary, perpendicular to the line of sight, and
terminate inside W50, a supernova remnant that is being distorted by the jets. SS 433 differs from
other microquasars in that the accretion is believed to be super-Eddington, and the luminosity
of the system is $\sim10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The lobes of W50 in which the jets terminate, about 40
pc from the central source, are expected to accelerate charged particles, and indeed radio and X-ray
emission consistent with electron synchrotron emission in a magnetic field have been observed.
At higher energies (>100 GeV), the particle fluxes of $\gamma$ rays from X-ray hotspots around SS
433 have been reported as flux upper limits. In this energy regime, it has been unclear whether the
emission is dominated by electrons that are interacting with photons from the cosmic microwave
background through inverse-Compton scattering or by protons interacting with the ambient gas.
Here we report TeV $\gamma$-ray observations of the SS 433/W50 system where the lobes are spatially
resolved. The TeV emission is localized to structures in the lobes, far from the center of the system
where the jets are formed. We have measured photon energies of at least 25 TeV, and these are certainly
not Doppler boosted, because of the viewing geometry. We conclude that the emission from radio to
TeV energies is consistent with a single population of electrons with energies extending to at least
hundreds of TeV in a magnetic field of $\sim16$~micro-Gauss.
