We present a sample of supernovae Type IIn (SNe IIn) from the untargeted, magnitude-limited surveys
of the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and its successor, iPTF. SNe IIn found and followed by the
PTF/iPTF were used to select a sample of 42 events with useful constraints on the rise times as well
as with available post-peak photometry. The SNe were discovered in 2009-2016 and have at least one
low-resolution classification spectrum, as well as photometry from the P48 and P60 telescopes
at Palomar Observatory. We study the light-curve properties of these SNe IIn using spline fits (for
the peak and the declining portion) and template matching (for the rising portion). We find that
the typical rise times are divided into fast and slow risers as $20\pm8$ d and $50\pm15$ d, respectively.
The decline rates could possibly be divided into two groups, but this division has weak statistical
significance. We find no significant correlation between the peak luminosity of SNe IIn and their
rise times, but the more luminous SNe IIn are generally found to be more durable and the slowly rising
SNe IIn are generally found to be slowly declining. The SNe in our sample were hosted by galaxies of
absolute magnitude $-22 \lesssim M_g \lesssim -13$ mag. The K-corrections at light-curve peak
of the SNe in our sample are found to be within 0.2 mag for the observer's frame $r$-band, for SNe IIn
at redshifts $z < 0.25$. Applying K-corrections and including also ostensibly ``superluminous''
SNe IIn, we find that the peak magnitudes are $M_{\rm peak}^{r} = -19.18\pm1.32$ mag. We conclude
that the occurrence of conspicuous light-curve bumps in SNe IIn, such as in iPTF13z, is limited to
$1.4^{+14.6}_{-1.0} \%$ of the SNe IIn. We also investigate a possible subtype of SNe IIn with a fast
rise to a $\gtrsim 50$ d plateau followed by a slow, linear decline.
