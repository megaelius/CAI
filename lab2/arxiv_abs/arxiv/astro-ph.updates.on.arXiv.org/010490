Clustering properties and peculiar velocities of halos in large-scale structure carry a wealth
of cosmological information over a wide range of scales from linear to nonlinear scales. We use halo
catalogs in a suite of high-resolution $N$-body simulations to construct mock catalogs of galaxies
that resemble the SDSS-like luminous early-type galaxies at three redshift bins in the range $0.15\le
z\le 0.7$. To do this we include 10 nuisance parameters to model variations in halo-galaxy connections
for each redshift bin; the halo occupation distribution, and the spatial and velocity distributions
of galaxies in the host halos. We evaluate the Fisher information matrix for the redshift-space
power spectrum of SDSS-like galaxies using different sets of the mock catalogs that are generated
from changes in each of model parameters; cosmological parameters ($\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm
m}$), the halo-galaxy connection parameters, and the cosmological distances ($D_{\rm A}$ and
$H$ parameters at each redshift bin) for modeling an apparent geometrical distortion of the redshift-space
power spectrum (the Alcock-Paczynski effect). We show that combining the monopole and quadrupole
power spectra of galaxies allows for accurate estimations of the cosmological parameters and the
cosmological distances, even after marginalization over the halo-galaxy parameters, by lifting
the parameter degeneracies that are otherwise inevitable if either of the two spectra alone is used.
When including the galaxy power spectrum information up to $k=0.3\,h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$, we find about
factor of 6 gain in the cosmological information content of ($\sigma_8,\Omega_{\rm m},D_{\rm
A}$'s and $H$'s) compared to $k=0.2\,h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$.
