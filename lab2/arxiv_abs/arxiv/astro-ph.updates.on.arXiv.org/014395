In high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), an accreting compact object orbits a high mass star which loses
mass through a dense and inhomogeneous wind. Using the compact object as an X-ray backlight, the
time variability of the absorbing column density in the wind can be exploited in order to shed light
on the micro-structure of the wind and obtain unbiased stellar mass loss rates for high mass stars.
We explore the impact of clumpiness on the variability of the column density with a simplified wind
model. In particular, we focus on the standard deviation of the column density and the characteristic
duration of enhanced absorption episodes, and compare them with analytical predictions based
on the porosity length. We identified the favorable systems and orbital phases to determine the
wind micro-structure. The coherence time scale of the column density is shown to be the self-crossing
time of a clump in front of the compact object. We provide a recipe to get accurate measurements of
the size and of the mass of the clumps, purely based on the observable time variability of the column
density. The coherence time scale grants direct access to the size of the clumps while their mass
can be deduced separately from the amplitude of the variability. If it is due to unaccreted passing-by
clumps, the high column density variations in some HMXBs requires high mass clumps to reproduce
the observed peak-to-peak amplitude and coherence time scales. These clump properties are hardly
compatible with the ones derived from first principles. Alternatively, other components could
contribute to the variability of the column density: larger orbital scale structures produced
by a mechanism still to be identified, or a dense environment in the immediate vicinity of the accretor
such as an accretion disk, an outflow or a spherical shell around the magnetosphere of the accreting
neutron star.
