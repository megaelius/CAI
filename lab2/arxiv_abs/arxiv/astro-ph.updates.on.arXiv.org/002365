Past observations of QSO host galaxies at z >6 have found cold gas and star formation on compact
scales of a few kiloparsecs. We present new high sensitivity IRAM PdBI follow-up observations of
the [CII] 158micron emission line and FIR continuum in the host galaxy of SDSS J1148+5152, a luminous
QSO at redshift 6.4189. We find that a large fraction of the gas traced by [CII] is at high velocities,
up to ~1400 km/s relative to the systemic velocity, confirming the presence of a major quasar-driven
outflow indicated by previous observations. The outflow has a complex morphology and reaches a
maximum projected radius of ~30 kpc. The extreme spatial extent of the outflow allows us, for the
first time in an external galaxy, to estimate mass-loss rate, kinetic power and momentum rate of
the outflow as a function of the projected distance from the nucleus and the dynamical time-scale.
These trends reveal multiple outflow events during the past 100 Myr, although the bulk of the mass,
energy and momentum appear to have been released more recently, within the past ~20 Myr. Surprisingly,
we discover that also the quiescent gas at systemic velocity is extremely extended. More specifically,
we find that, while 30% of the [CII] within v\in(-200, 200) km/s traces a compact component that is
not resolved by our observations, 70% of the [CII] emission in this velocity range is extended, with
a projected FWHM size of 17.4+-1.4 kpc. We detect FIR continuum emission associated with both the
compact and the extended [CII] components, although the extended FIR emission has a FWHM of 11+-2
kpc, thus smaller than the extended [CII] source. Overall, our results indicate that the cold gas
traced by [CII] is distributed up to r~30 kpc. A large fraction of extended [CII] is likely associated
with star formation on large scales, but the [CII] source extends well beyond the FIR continuum.
