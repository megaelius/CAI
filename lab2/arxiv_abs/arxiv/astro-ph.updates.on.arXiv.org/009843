We use the SPHINX suite of high-resolution cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations
to study how spatially and temporally inhomogeneous reionization impacts the baryonic content
of dwarf galaxies and cosmic filaments. The SPHINX simulations simultaneously capture the large-scale
process of reionization, model the escape of ionising radiation from thousands of galaxies, and
resolve haloes well below the atomic cooling threshold. This makes them an ideal tool for examining
how reionization impacts star formation and the gas content of dwarf galaxies. We compare simulations
with and without stellar radiation to isolate the effects of radiation feedback from that of supernova,
cosmic expansion, and numerical resolution. We find that the gas content of cosmic filaments can
be reduced by more than 80% following reionization. The gas inflow rates into haloes with $M_{vir}\lesssim10^8M_{\odot}$
are strongly affected and are reduced by more than an order of magnitude compared to the simulation
without reionization. A significant increase in gas outflow rates is found for halo masses $M_{vir}\lesssim7\times10^7M_{\odot}$.
Our simulations show that inflow suppression (i.e. starvation), rather than photoevaporation,
is the dominant mechanism by which the baryonic content of high-redshift dwarf galaxies is regulated.
At fixed redshift and halo mass, there is a large scatter in the halo baryon fractions that is entirely
dictated by the timing of reionization in the local region surrounding a halo. Finally, although
the gas content of high-redshift dwarf galaxies is significantly impacted by reionization, we
find that most haloes with $M_{vir}\lesssim10^8M_{\odot}$ can remain self-shielded and form
stars long after reionization, until their local gas reservoir is depleted, suggesting that local
group dwarf galaxies do not necessarily exhibit star formation histories that peak prior to $z=6$.
