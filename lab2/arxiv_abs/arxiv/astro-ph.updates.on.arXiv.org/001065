We present an overview of a 90-orbit Hubble Space Telescope treasury program to obtain near ultraviolet
imaging of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field using the Wide Field Camera 3 UVIS detector with the F225W,
F275W, and F336W filters. This survey is designed to: (i) Investigate the episode of peak star formation
activity in galaxies at 1<z<2.5; (ii) Probe the evolution of massive galaxies by resolving
sub-galactic units (clumps); (iii) Examine the escape fraction of ionizing radiation from galaxies
at z~2-3; (iv) Greatly improve the reliability of photometric redshift estimates; and (v) Measure
the star formation rate efficiency of neutral atomic-dominated hydrogen gas at z~1-3. In this overview
paper, we describe the survey details and data reduction challenges, including both the necessity
of specialized calibrations and the effects of charge transfer inefficiency. We provide a stark
demonstration of the effects of charge transfer inefficiency on resultant data products, which
when uncorrected, result in uncertain photometry, elongation of morphology in the readout direction,
and loss of faint sources far from the readout. We agree with the STScI recommendation that future
UVIS observations that require very sensitive measurements use the instrument's capability to
add background light through a "post-flash". Preliminary results on number counts of UV-selected
galaxies and morphology of galaxies at z~1 are presented. We find that the number density of UV dropouts
at redshifts 1.7, 2.1, and 2.7 is largely consistent with the number predicted by published luminosity
functions. We also confirm that the image mosaics have sufficient sensitivity and resolution to
support the analysis of the evolution of star-forming clumps, reaching 28-29th magnitude depth
at 5 sigma in a 0.2 arcsecond radius aperture depending on filter and observing epoch.
