Donald Lynden-Bell's many contributions to astrophysics encompass general relativity, galactic
dynamics, telescope design and observational astronomy. In the 1960s, his papers on stellar dynamics
led to fundamental insights into the equilibria of elliptical galaxies, the growth of spiral patterns
in disc galaxies and the stability of differentially rotating, self-gravitating flows. Donald
introduced the ideas of `violent relaxation' and `the gravothermal catastrophe' in pioneering
work on the thermodynamics of galaxies and negative heat capacities. He shared the inaugural Kavli
Prize in Astrophysics in 2008 for his contributions to our understanding of quasars. His prediction
that dead quasars or supermassive black holes may reside in the nuclei of nearby galaxies has been
confirmed by multiple pieces of independent evidence. His work on accretion discs led to new insights
into their workings, as well as the realisation that the infrared excess in T Tauri stars was caused
by protostellar discs around these young stars. He introduced the influential idea of monolithic
collapse of a gas cloud as a formation mechanism for the Milky Way Galaxy. As this gave way to modern
ideas of merging and accretion as drivers of galaxy formation, Donald was the first to realise the
importance of tidal streams as measures of the past history and present day gravity field of the Galaxy.
Though primarily a theorist, Donald participated in one of the first observational programs to
measure the large-scale streaming of nearby galaxies. This led to the discovery of the `Great Attractor'.
The depth and versatility of his contributions mark Donald out as one of the most influential and
pre-eminent astronomers of his day.
