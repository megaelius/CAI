Disk galaxies can exchange angular momentum and baryons with their host dark matter (DM) halos.
These halos possess internal spin, `lambda', which is insignificant rotationally but does affect
interactions between the baryonic and DM components. While statistics of prograde and retrograde
spinning halos in galaxies is not available at present, the existence of such halos is important
for galaxy evolution. In the previous works, we analyzed dynamical and secular evolution of stellar
bars in prograde spinning halos and the DM response to the bar perturbation, and found that it is modified
by the resonant interactions between the bar and the DM halo orbits. In the present work, we follow
the evolution of stellar bars in retrograde halos. We find, that this evolution differs substantially
from evolution in rigid unresponsive halos, discussed in the literature. First, we confirm that
the bar instability is delayed progressively along the retrograde `lambda' sequence. Second,
the bar evolution in the retrograde halos differs also from that in the prograde halos, in that the
bars continue to grow substantially over the simulation time of 10 Gyr. The DM response is also substantially
weaker compared to this response in the prograde halos. Third, using orbital spectral analysis
of the DM orbital structure, we find a phenomenon we call the orbit reversal --- when retrograde DM
orbits interact with the stellar bar, reverse their streaming and precession, and become prograde.
This process dominates the inner halo region adjacent to the bar and allows these orbits to be trapped
by the bar, thus increasing efficiency of angular momentum transfer by the Inner Lindblad Resonance.
We demonstrate this reversal process explicitly in a number of examples.
