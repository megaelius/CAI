The infrared source known as Orion n was detected in 1980 with observations made with the 3.8-m United
Kingdom Infrared Telescope. About two decades later, sensitive observations made with the Very
Large Array revealed the presence of a mJy double radio source apparently coincident in position
with the infrared source n. The radio source was assumed to be the counterpart of the infrared source.
However, over the years it has been concluded that the radio source shows large proper motions to
the south while the infrared source n is stationary. Here we reanalyze the proper motions of the radio
source adding both older and newer VLA observations than previously used. We confirm the proper
motions of the radio source that at present no longer coincides positionally with the infrared source.
The solution to this problem is, most probably, that the infrared source n and the radio source are
not the same object: the infrared source is a stationary object in the region while the radio counterpart
is moving as a result of the explosion that took place in this region some 500 years ago and that expelled
large amounts of molecular gas as well as several compact sources. Considering the paper where it
was first reported, we refer to this double radio source as Orion MR. In addition, we use these new
observations to fully confirm the large proper motions of the sources IRc23 and Zapata 11. Together
with sources BN, I, Orion MR, and x, there are at least six compact sources that recede from a point
in common in Orion BN/KL. However, IRc23 is peculiar in that its ejection age appears to be only $\sim$300
years. The relatively large number of sources rules out as a possible mechanism the classic three-body
scenario since then only two escaping bodies are expected: a tight binary plus the third star involved
in the encounter.
