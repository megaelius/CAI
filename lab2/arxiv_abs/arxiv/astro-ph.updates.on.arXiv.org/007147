We implemented non-solar-scaled opacities in a simultaneous derivation of fundamental parameters
and abundances. We carried out a high-precision stellar parameters and abundance determination
by applying non-solar-scaled opacities and model atmospheres. Our sample is composed by 20 stars
including main-sequence and evolved objects. Opacities for an arbitrary composition and vmicro
were calculated through the Opacity Sampling method. We obtained a small difference in stellar
parameters derived with non-solar-scaled opacities compared to classical solar-scaled models.
The differences in Teff, log g and [Fe/H] amount up to 26 K, 0.05 dex and 0.020 dex for the stars in our
sample. These differences could be considered as the first estimation of the error due to the use
of classical solar-scaled opacities to derive stellar parameters with solar-type and evolved
stars. Some chemical species could also show an individual variation higher than those of the [Fe/H]
(up to 0.03 dex) and varying from one specie to another, obtaining a chemical pattern difference
between both methods. This means that condensation temperature Tc trends could also present a variation.
We include an example showing that using non-solar-scaled opacities, the classical solution cannot
always verify the excitation and ionization balance conditions required for a model atmosphere.
We consider that the use of the non-solar-scaled opacities is not mandatory in every statistical
study with large samples of stars. However, for those high-precision works whose results depend
on the mutual comparison of different chemical species (such as Tc trends), we consider that it is
worthwhile its application. To date, this is probably one of the more precise spectroscopic methods
of stellar parameters derivation [abridged].
