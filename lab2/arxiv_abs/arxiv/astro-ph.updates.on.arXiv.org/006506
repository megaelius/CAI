The ratio of penumbral to umbral area of sunspots is an important topic for solar and geophysical
studies. Hathaway (Solar Physics, 286, 347, 2013) found a curious behaviour in this parameter for
small sunspot groups (areas smaller than 100 millionths of solar hemisphere, msh) using records
from Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO). Hathaway showed that penumbra-umbra ratio decreased
smoothly from more than 7 in 1905 to lower than 3 by 1930 and then increased to almost 8 in 1961. Thus,
Hathaway proposed the existence of a secular variation in the penumbra-umbra area ratio. In order
to confirm that secular variation, we employ data of the sunspot catalogue published by the Coimbra
Astronomical Observatory (COI) for the period 1929-1941. Our results disagree with the penumbra-umbra
ratio found by Hathaway for that period. However, the behaviour of this ratio for large (areas greater
or equal than 100 msh) and small groups registered in COI during 1929-1941 is similar to data available
from RGO for the periods 1874-1914 and 1950-1976. Nevertheless, while the average values and time
evolution of the ratio in large groups is similar to the ratio for small groups according to Coimbra
data (1929-1941) it is not analogous for RGO data for the same period. We also found that the behaviour
of the penumbra-umbra area ratio for smaller groups in both observatories is significantly different.
The main difference between the area measurements made in Coimbra and RGO is associated with the
umbra measurements. We would like to stress that the two observatories used different methods of
observation and while in COI both methodology and instruments did not change during the study period,
some changes were carried out in RGO that could have affected measurements of umbra and penumbra.
These facts illustrate the importance of the careful recovery of past solar data.
