To illustrate the potential of GDR2, we provide a first look at the kinematics of the Milky Way disc,
within a radius of several kiloparsecs around the Sun. We benefit for the first time from a sample
of 6.4 million F-G-K stars with full 6D phase-space coordinates, precise parallaxes, and precise
Galactic cylindrical velocities . From this sample, we extracted a sub-sample of 3.2 million giant
stars to map the velocity field of the Galactic disc from $\sim$5~kpc to $\sim$13~kpc from the Galactic
centre and up to 2~kpc above and below the plane. We also study the distribution of 0.3 million solar
neighbourhood stars ($r < 200$~pc), with median velocity uncertainties of 0.4~km/s, in velocity
space and use the full sample to examine how the over-densities evolve in more distant regions. GDR2
allows us to draw 3D maps of the Galactocentric median velocities and velocity dispersions with
unprecedented accuracy, precision, and spatial resolution. The maps show the complexity and richness
of the velocity field of the galactic disc. We observe streaming motions in all the components of
the velocities as well as patterns in the velocity dispersions. For example, we confirm the previously
reported negative and positive galactocentric radial velocity gradients in the inner and outer
disc, respectively. Here, we see them as part of a non-axisymmetric kinematic oscillation, and
we map its azimuthal and vertical behaviour. We also witness a new global arrangement of stars in
the velocity plane of the solar neighbourhood and in distant regions in which stars are organised
in thin substructures with the shape of circular arches that are oriented approximately along the
horizontal direction in the $U-V$ plane. Moreover, in distant regions, we see variations in the
velocity substructures more clearly than ever before, in particular, variations in the velocity
of the Hercules stream. (abridged)
