In this work we present a new hybrid method to simulate the thermal effects of the reionization in
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The method improves upon the standard approach used
in simulations of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and galaxy formation without a significant increase
of the computational cost allowing for efficient exploration of the parameter space. The method
uses a small set of phenomenological input parameters and combines a semi-numerical reionization
model to solve for the topology of reionization and an approximate model of how reionization heats
the IGM, with the massively parallel \texttt{Nyx} hydrodynamics code, specifically designed
to solve for the structure of diffuse IGM gas. We have produced several large-scale high resolution
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations ($2048^3$, $L_{\rm box} = 40$ Mpc/h) with different
instantaneous and inhomogeneous HI reionization models that use this new methodology. We study
the IGM thermal properties of these models and find that large scale temperature fluctuations extend
well beyond the end of reionization. Analyzing the 1D flux power spectrum of these models, we find
up to $\sim 50\%$ differences in the large scale properties (low modes, $k\lesssim0.01$ s/km) of
the post-reionization power spectrum due to the thermal fluctuations. We show that these differences
could allow one to distinguish between different reionization scenarios already with existing
Ly$\alpha$ forest measurements. Finally, we explore the differences in the small-scale cutoff
of the power spectrum and we find that, for the same heat input, models show very good agreement provided
that the reionization redshift of the instantaneous reionization model happens at the midpoint
of the inhomogeneous model.
