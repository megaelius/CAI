We discuss constraints on cosmic reionisation and their implications on a cosmic SFR density $\rho_\mathrm{SFR}$
model; we study the influence of key-parameters such as the clumping factor of ionised hydrogen
in the intergalactic medium (IGM) $C_{H_{II}}$ and the fraction of ionising photons escaping star-forming
galaxies to reionise the IGM $f_\mathrm{esc}$. Our analysis uses SFR history data coming from luminosity
functions, assuming that star-forming galaxies were sufficient to lead the reionisation process
at high redshift. We add two other sets of constraints: measurements of the IGM ionised fraction
and the most recent result from Planck Satellite about the integrated Thomson optical depth of the
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) $\tau_\mathrm{Planck}$. We also consider various possibilities
for the evolution of these two parameters with redshift, and confront them with observational data
cited above. We conclude that, if the model of a constant clumping factor is chosen, the fiducial
value of $3$ often used in papers is consistent with observations; even if a redshift-dependent
model is considered, the resulting optical depth is strongly correlated to $C_{H_{II}}$ mean value
at $z>7$, an additional argument in favour of the use of a constant clumping factor. Besides, the
escape fraction is related to too many astrophysical parameters to allow us to use a complete and
fully satisfactory model. A constant value with redshift seems again to be the most likely expression:
considering it as a fit parameter, we get from the maximum likelihood (ML) model $f_\mathrm{esc}=0.24\pm0.08$;
with a redshift-dependent model, we find an almost constant evolution, slightly increasing with
$z$, around $f_\mathrm{esc}=0.23$. Last, our analysis shows that a reionisation beginning as
early as $z\geq14$ and persisting until $z\sim6$ is a likely storyline.
