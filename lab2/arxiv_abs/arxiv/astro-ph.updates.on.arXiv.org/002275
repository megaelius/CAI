The majority of binary stars do not eclipse. Current searches for transiting circumbinary planets
concentrate on eclipsing binaries, and are therefore restricted to a small fraction of potential
hosts. We investigate the concept of finding planets transiting non-eclipsing binaries, whose
geometry would require mutually inclined planes. Using an N-body code we explore how the number
and sequence of transits vary as functions of observing time and orbital parameters. The concept
is then generalised thanks to a suite of simulated circumbinary systems. Binaries are constructed
from RV surveys of the solar neighbourhood. They are then populated with orbiting gas giants, drawn
from a range of distributions. The binary population is shown to be compatible with the Kepler eclipsing
binary catalogue, indicating that the properties of binaries may be as universal as the initial
mass function. These synthetic systems produce transiting circumbinary planets occurring on
both eclipsing and non-eclipsing binaries. Simulated planets transiting eclipsing binaries
are compared with published Kepler detections. We obtain 1) that planets transiting non-eclipsing
binaries probably exist in the Kepler data, 2) that observational biases alone cannot account for
the observed over-density of circumbinary planets near the stability limit, implying a physical
pile-up, and 3) that the distributions of gas giants orbiting single and binary stars are likely
different. Estimating the frequency of circumbinary planets is degenerate with the spread in mutual
inclination. Only a minimum occurrence rate can be produced, which we find to be compatible with
9%. Searching for inclined circumbinary planets may significantly increase the population of
known objects and will test our conclusions. Their existence, or absence, will reveal the true occurrence
rate and help develop circumbinary planet formation theories.
