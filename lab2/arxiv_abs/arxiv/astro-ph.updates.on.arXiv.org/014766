We search for strongly lensed and multiply imaged gravitational wave signals in the second observing
run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo (O2). We exploit a new source of information, the so-called
Morse phase, which further mitigates the search background and constrains viable lenses. The best
candidate we find is consistent with a strongly lensed signal from a massive binary black hole (BBH)
merger, with three detected images consisting of the previously catalogued events GW170104 and
GW170814, and a subthreshold trigger, GWC170620. Given the number of BBH events detected so far,
we estimate an overall false alarm probability $\sim 10^{-4}$ for the observed high degree of parameter
coincidence between the three events. On the flip side, we measure the Morse phase differences which
suggest a complex and atypical lens system, with at least five images including a magnified image
at a local maximum of the Fermat potential. The low prior probability for multiple lensed images
and the amount of fine tuning required in the lens model reduce the credibility of the lensing hypothesis.
The long time delays between lensed images point toward a galaxy cluster lens with an internal velocity
dispersion $\sigma \sim 650\,{\rm km/s}$, and the observed strain amplitudes imply a likely range
$0.4 < z \lesssim 0.7$ for the source redshift. We provide an error ellipse of $\sim 16\,{\rm deg}^2$
for the sky location of the source together with additional specific constraints on the lens-host
system, and encourage follow-up efforts to confirm or rule out any viable lens. If this is indeed
a lensed event, successfully pinpointing the system would offer a unique opportunity to identify
the host galaxy of a BBH merger, and even localize the source within it.
