Stellar activity is the main limitation to the detection of Earth-twins using the RV technique.
Despite many efforts in trying to mitigate the effect of stellar activity using empirical and statistical
techniques, it seems that we are facing an obstacle that will be extremely difficult to overcome
using current techniques. In this paper, we investigate a novel approach to derive precise RVs considering
the wealth of information present in high-resolution spectra. This new method consists in building
a master spectrum from all observations and measure the RVs of each spectral line in a spectrum relative
to it. When analysing several spectra, the final product is the RVs of each line as a function of time.
We demonstrate on three stars intensively observed with HARPS that our new method gives RVs that
are extremely similar to the ones derived from the HARPS data reduction software. Our new approach
to derive RVs demonstrates that the non-stability of daily HARPS wavelength solution induces night-to-night
RV offsets with an standard deviation of 0.4 m/s, and we propose a solution to correct for this systematic.
Finally, and this is probably the most astrophysically relevant result of this paper, we demonstrate
that some spectral lines are strongly affected by stellar activity while others are not. By measuring
the RVs on two carefully selected subsample of spectral lines, we demonstrate that we can boost by
a factor of 2 or mitigate by a factor of 1.6 the red noise induced by stellar activity in the 2010 RVs
of Alpha Cen B. By measuring the RVs of each spectral line, we are able to reach the same RV precision
as other approved techniques. In addition, this new approach allows to demonstrate that each line
is differently affected by stellar activity. Preliminary results show that studying in details
the behaviour of each spectral line is probably the key to overcome stellar activity.
