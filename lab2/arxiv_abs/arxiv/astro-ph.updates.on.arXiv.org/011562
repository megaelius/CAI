We review and discuss insights on ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities that can play
a role in destabilizing solar coronal flux rope structures. For single flux ropes, failed or actual
eruptions may result from internal or external kink evolutions, or from torus unstable configurations.
We highlight recent findings from 3D magnetic field reconstructions and simulations where kink
and torus instabilities play a prominent role. For interacting current systems, we critically
discuss different routes to coronal dynamics and global eruptions, due to current channel coalescence
or to tilt-kink scenarios. These scenarios involve the presence of two nearby current channels
and are clearly distinct from the popular kink or torus instability. Since the solar corona is pervaded
with myriads of magnetic loops -- creating interacting flux ropes typified by parallel or antiparallel
current channels as exemplified in various recent observational studies -- coalescence or tilt-kink
evolutions must be very common for destabilizing adjacent flux rope systems. Since they also evolve
on ideal MHD timescales, they may well drive many sympathetic eruptions witnessed in the solar corona.
Moreover, they necessarily lead to thin current sheets that are liable to reconnection. We review
findings from 2D and 3D MHD simulations for tilt and coalescence evolutions, as well as on particle
acceleration aspects derived from computed charged particle motions in tilt-kink disruptions
and coalescing flux ropes. The latter were recently studied in two-way coupled kinetic-fluid models,
where the complete phase-space information of reconnection is incorporated.
