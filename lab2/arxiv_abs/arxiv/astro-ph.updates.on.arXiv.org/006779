The NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission will discover thousands of candidate
transiting exoplanets. Due to the mission configuration, 74% of the area to be observed by TESS will
only have an observational baseline of 27 days. For planets with orbital periods longer than 13.5
days, TESS can only capture one or two transits, which means the true ephemerides will be difficult
to determine from TESS data alone. Follow-up observations candidates to efficiently confirm and
characterize them will require precise ephemerides. We explore the value of using existing ground-based
wide-field photometric surveys to constrain the ephemerides of the TESS single-transit candidates.
The Kilodegree Extremely Little Transit (KELT) survey has a long observation baseline (up to eight
years) and monitors fields that largely overlap with the TESS footprint, and also observes stars
of similar brightness. We insert simulated TESS-detected single transits into KELT light curves,
and evaluate how well their orbital periods can be recovered. We find that KELT photometry can be
used to confirm ephemerides with high accuracy for planets of Saturn size or larger with orbital
periods as long as a year, and therefore span a wide range of planet equilibrium temperatures. The
resulting periods and ephemerides of the signals can then be used by follow-up teams, whether part
of the TESS mission or community-organized TESS follow-up, to plan and coordinate follow-up observations
to confirm candidates as planets, eclipsing binaries, or other false positives, as well as to conduct
detailed transit observations with facilities like JWST or HST.
