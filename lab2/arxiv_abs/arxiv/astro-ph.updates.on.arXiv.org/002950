After numerous astronomical and experimental searches, the precise particle nature of dark matter
is still unknown. The standard Weakly Interacting Massive Particle(WIMP) dark matter, despite
successfully explaining the large-scale features of the universe, has long-standing small-scale
issues. The spectral distortion in the Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB) caused by Silk damping
in the pre-recombination era allows one to access information on a range of small scales $0.3 \, {\rm
Mpc} < k < 10^4 \, \rm Mpc^{-1}$, whose dynamics can be precisely described using linear theory. In
this paper, we investigate the possibility of using the Silk damping induced CMB spectral distortion
as a probe of the small-scale power. We consider four suggested alternative dark matter candidates---Warm
Dark Matter (WDM), Late Forming Dark Matter, Ultra Light Axion dark matter and Charged Decaying
Dark Matter; the matter power in all these models deviate significantly from the $\Lambda$CDM model
at small scales. We compute the spectral distortion of CMB for these alternative models and compare
our results with the $\Lambda$CDM model. We show that the main impact of alternative models is to
alter the sub-horizon evolution of the Newtonian potential which affects the late-time behaviour
of spectral distortion of CMB. The $y$-parameter diminishes by a few percent as compared to the $\Lambda$CDM
model for a range of parameters of these models: LFDM for formation redshift $z_f = 10^5$ (7\%); WDM
for mass $m_{\rm wdm} = 1 \, \rm keV$ (2\%); CHDM for decay redshift $z_{\rm decay} = 10^5$ (5\%); ULA
for mass $m_a = 10^{-24} \, \rm eV$ (3\%). We also briefly discuss the detectability of this deviation
in light of the upcoming CMB experiment PIXIE, which might have the sensitivity to detect this signal
from the pre-recombination phase.
