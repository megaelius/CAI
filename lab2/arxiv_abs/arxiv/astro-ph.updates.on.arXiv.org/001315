Recent determination of the distance to HDE 226868/Cyg X-1 binary system (Reid et al., 2011) and
more precise determination of the effective temperature of HDE 226868 (Caballero- Nieves et al.,
2009) permit a more accurate estimate of the masses of both components. Using up to date evolutionary
models, I obtain a mass range of between 25 to 35 Msun for the mass of the supergiant and between 13 to
23 Msun for the mass of the black hole. Accepting more liberal estimates of uncertainties in both
the distance and the effective temperature, one may extend these ranges to 21 to 35 Msun and 10 to 23
Msun for both masses, respectively. The most likely values within these ranges are, respectively,
27 Msun and 16 Msun. The obtained mass of black hole agrees with the value 15 +- 1 Msun suggested by Orosz
et al. (2011). However, the value suggested by them for the mass of the supergiant of 19 +- 2 Msun should
not be used as such a star violates the mass-luminosity relation for the the massive core hydrogen
burning stars. This consideration was not incorporated into the iterative process of Orosz et al.
To resolve this violation I consider the possibility that the hydrogen content of HDE 222268 might
be lowered as a result of the mass transfer and the induced fast rotation of the mass gainer. I analyzed
the evolutionary effects of such situation and found that, while important, they do not invalidate
the conclusions listed above. If, as a result of the rotation induced mixing, the present hydrogen
content of HDE 226868 is equal about 0.6 (as suggested by some observational data), then its present
mass may be somewhat lower: about 24 Msun rather than about 27 Msun.
