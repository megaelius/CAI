We analyse the physical properties of a large, homogeneously selected sample of ALMA-located sub-mm
galaxies (SMGs) detected in the SCUBA-2 CLS 850-$\mu$m map of the UKIDSS/UDS field. This survey,
AS2UDS, identified 707 SMGs across the ~1 sq.deg. field, including ~17 per cent which are undetected
in the optical/near-infrared to $K$>~25.7 mag. We interpret the UV-to-radio data using a physically
motivated model, MAGPHYS and determine a median photometric redshift of z=2.61+-0.08, with a 68th
percentile range of z=1.8-3.4 and just ~6 per cent at z>4. The redshift distribution is well fit by
a model combining evolution of the gas fraction in halos with the growth of halo mass past a threshold
of ~4x10$^{12}$M$_\odot$, thus SMGs may represent the highly efficient collapse of gas-rich massive
halos. Our survey provides a sample of the most massive, dusty galaxies at z>~1, with median dust
and stellar masses of $M_d$=(6.8+-0.3)x10$^{8}$M$_\odot$ (thus, gas masses of ~10$^{11}$M$_\odot$)
and $M_\ast=$(1.26+-0.05)x10$^{11}$M$_\odot$. These galaxies have gas fractions of $f_{gas}=$0.41+-0.02
with depletion timescales of ~150Myr. The gas mass function evolution at high masses is consistent
with constraints at lower masses from blind CO-surveys, with an increase to z~2-3 and then a decline
at higher redshifts. The space density and masses of SMGs suggests that almost all galaxies with
$M_\ast$>~2x10$^{11}$M$_\odot$ have passed through an SMG-like phase. We find no evolution in
dust temperature at a constant far-infrared luminosity across z~1.5-4. We show that SMGs appear
to behave as simple homologous systems in the far-infrared, having properties consistent with
a centrally illuminated starburst. Our study provides strong support for an evolutionary link
between the active, gas-rich SMG population at z>1 and the formation of massive, bulge-dominated
galaxies across the history of the Universe.
