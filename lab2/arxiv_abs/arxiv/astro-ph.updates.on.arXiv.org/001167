We use high--quality, multi-band observations of Swift GRB120404A, from gamma-ray to radio frequencies,
together with the new hydrodynamics code of van Eerten et al. (2012) to test the standard synchrotron
shock model. The evolution of the radio and optical afterglow, with its prominent optical rebrightening
at t_rest 260-2600 s, is remarkably well modelled by a decelerating jet viewed close to the jet edge,
combined with some early re-energization of the shock. We thus constrain the geometry of the jet
with half-opening and viewing angles of 23 and 21 deg respectively and suggest that wide jets viewed
off-axis are more common in GRBs than previously thought. We also derive the fireball microphysics
parameters epsilon_B=2.4e-4 and epsilon_e=9.3e-2 and a circumburst density of n=240 cm^-3. The
ability to self-consistently model the microphysics parameters and jet geometry in this way offers
an alternative to trying to identify elusive canonical jet breaks at late times. The mismatch between
the observed and model-predicted X-ray fluxes is explained by the local rather than the global cooling
approximation in the synchrotron radiation model, constraining the microphysics of particle
acceleration taking place in a relativistic shock and, in turn, emphasising the need for a more realistic
treatment of cooling in future developments of theoretical models. Finally, our interpretation
of the optical peak as due to the passage of the forward shock synchrotron frequency highlights the
importance of high quality multi-band data to prevent some optical peaks from being erroneously
attributed to the onset of fireball deceleration.
