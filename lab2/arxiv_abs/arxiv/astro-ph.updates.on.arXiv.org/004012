We present reverberation mapping results from the first year of combined spectroscopic and photometric
observations of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project. We successfully recover
reverberation time delays between the $g+i$-band emission and the broad H$\beta$ emission line
for a total of 44 quasars, and for the broad H$\alpha$ emission line in 18 quasars. Time delays are
computed using the JAVELIN and CREAM software and the traditional interpolated cross-correlation
function (ICCF): Using well defined criteria, we report measurements of 32 H$\beta$ and 13 H$\alpha$
lags with JAVELIN, 42 H$\beta$ and 17 H$\alpha$ lags with CREAM, and 16 H$\beta$ and 8 H$\alpha$ lags
with the ICCF. Lag values are generally consistent among the three methods, though we typically
measure smaller uncertainties with JAVELIN and CREAM than with the ICCF, given the more physically
motivated light curve interpolation and more robust statistical modeling of the former two methods.
The median redshift of our H$\beta$-detected sample of quasars is 0.53, significantly higher than
that of the previous reverberation-mapping sample. We find that in most objects, the time delay
of the H$\alpha$ emission is consistent with or slightly longer than that of H$\beta$. We measure
black hole masses using our measured time delays and line widths for these quasars. These black hole
mass measurements are mostly consistent with expectations based on the local M-sigma relationship,
and are also consistent with single-epoch black hole mass measurements. This work increases the
current sample size of reverberation-mapped active galaxies by about two-thirds and represents
the first large sample of reverberation mapping observations beyond the local universe (z < 0.3).
