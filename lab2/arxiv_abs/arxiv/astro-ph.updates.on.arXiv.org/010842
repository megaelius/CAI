We examine the connection between the properties of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the quenching
and morphological evolution of central galaxies in the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG simulations. The
simulations yield very different median CGM mass fractions, $f_{\rm CGM}$, as a function of halo
mass, $M_{200}$, with low-mass haloes being significantly more gas-rich in IllustrisTNG than
in EAGLE. Nonetheless, in both cases scatter in $f_{\rm CGM}$ at fixed $M_{200}$ is strongly correlated
with the specific star formation rate and the kinematic morphology of central galaxies. The correlations
are strongest for $\sim L^\star$ galaxies, corresponding to the mass scale at which expulsive AGN
feedback becomes efficient. This feedback elevates the CGM cooling time, preventing gas from accreting
onto the galaxy to fuel star formation, and thus establishing a preference for quenched, spheroidal
galaxies to be hosted by haloes with low $f_{\rm CGM}$ for their mass. In both simulations, $f_{\rm
CGM}$ correlates negatively with the host halo's intrinsic concentration, and hence with its binding
energy and formation redshift, primarily because early halo formation fosters the rapid early
growth of the central black hole (BH). This leads to a lower $f_{\rm CGM}$ at fixed $M_{200}$ in EAGLE
because the BH reaches high accretion rates sooner, whilst in IllustrisTNG it occurs because the
central BH reaches the mass threshold at which AGN feedback is assumed to switch from thermal to kinetic
injection earlier. Despite these differences, there is consensus from these state-of-the-art
simulations that the expulsion of efficiently-cooling gas from the CGM is a crucial step in the quenching
and morphological evolution of central galaxies.
