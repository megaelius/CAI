The aim of this study is to constrain the dynamics, structure and feeding of the compact nucleous
of NGC4418, and to reveal the nature of the main hidden power source: starburst or AGN. We obtained
high spatial resolution observations of NGC4418 at 1.4 and 5 GHz with MERLIN, and at 230 and 270 GHz
with the SMA very extended configuration. We use the continuum morphology and flux density to estimate
the size of the emitting region, the star formation rate and the dust temperature. Emission lines
are used to study the kinematics through position-velocity diagrams. Molecular emission is studied
with population diagrams and by fitting an LTE synthetic spectrum. We detect bright 1mm line emission
from CO, HC3N, HNC and C34S, and 1.4 GHz absorption from HI. The CO 2-1 emission and HI absorption can
be fit by two velocity components at 2090 and 2180 km s-1. We detect vibrationally excited HC3N and
HNC, with Tvib 300K. Molecular excitation is consistent with a layered temperature structure,
with three main components at 80, 160 and 300 K. For the hot component we estimate a source size of less
than 5 pc. The nuclear molecular gas surface density of 1e4 Msun pc-2 is extremely high, and similar
to that found in the ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) Arp220. Our observations confirm the
the presence of a molecular and atomic in-flow, previously suggested by Herschel observations,
which is feeding the activity in the center of NGC4418. Molecular excitation confirms the presence
of a very compact, hot dusty core. If a starburst is responsible for the observed IR flux, this has
to be at least as extreme as the one in Arp220, with an age of 3-10 Myr and a star formation rate >10
Msun yr-1. If an AGN is present, it must be extremely Compton-thick.
