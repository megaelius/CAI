The existence of strange quark stars has been proposed many years ago. More recently, the possible
co-existence of a first family composed of "normal" neutron stars with a second family of strange
quark stars has been proposed as a solution of problems related to the maximum mass and to the minimal
radius of these compact stellar objects. In this paper we study the mass distribution of compact
objects formed in binary systems and the relative fractions of quark and neutron stars in different
subpopulations. We incorporate the strange quark star formation model provided by the two-families
scenario and we perform a large-scale population synthesis study in order to obtain the population
characteristics. In our model, below a critical gravitational mass $M_\mathrm{max}^H- \Delta
M$ only normal (hadron) neutron stars exist. Then in the mass range $(M_\mathrm{max}^H- \Delta
M) \leqslant M \leqslant M_\mathrm{max}^H$ strange quark stars and neutron stars coexist. Finally,
above $M_\mathrm{max}^H$ all compact objects are strange quark stars. We argue that $M_\mathrm{max}^H$
is in the range $\sim 1.5-1.6 M_\odot$. According to our results, the main channel for strange quark
star formation in binary systems is accretion from a secondary companion on a neutron star.This
opens the possibility of having explosive GRB-like phenomena not related to supernovae and not
due to the merger of two neutron stars. The enhancement in the number of compact objects in the co-existence
mass range $(M_\mathrm{max}^H- \Delta M) \leqslant M \leqslant M_\mathrm{max}^H$ is not very
pronounced. The number of double strange quark star's systems is rather small with only a tiny fraction
which merge within a Hubble time. This drastically limits the flux of strangelets produced by the
merger, which turns out to be compatible with all limits stemming from Earth and lunar experiments.
