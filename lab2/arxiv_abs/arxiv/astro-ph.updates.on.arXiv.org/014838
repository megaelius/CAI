We review the importance of recent UV observations of solar system targets and discuss the need for
further measurements, instrumentation and laboratory work in the coming decade. In the past decade,
numerous important advances have been made in solar system science using ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopic
techniques. Formerly used nearly exclusively for studies of giant planet atmospheres, planetary
exospheres and cometary emissions, UV imaging spectroscopy has recently been more widely applied.
The geyser-like plume at Saturn's moon Enceladus was discovered in part as a result of UV stellar
occultation observations, and this technique was used to characterize the plume and jets during
the entire Cassini mission. Evidence for a similar style of activity has been found at Jupiter's
moon Europa using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV emission and absorption imaging. At other moons
and small bodies throughout the solar system, UV spectroscopy has been utilized to search for activity,
probe surface composition, and delineate space weathering effects; UV photometric studies have
been used to uncover regolith structure. Insights from UV imaging spectroscopy of solar system
surfaces have been gained largely in the last 1-2 decades, including studies of surface composition,
space weathering effects (e.g. radiolytic products) and volatiles on asteroids (e.g. [2][39][48][76][84]),
the Moon (e.g. [30][46][49]), comet nuclei (e.g. [85]) and icy satellites (e.g. [38][41-44][45][47][65]).
The UV is sensitive to some species, minor contaminants and grain sizes often not detected in other
spectral regimes. In the coming decade, HST observations will likely come to an end. New infrastructure
to bolster future UV studies is critically needed. These needs include both developmental work
to help improve future UV observations and laboratory work to help interpret spacecraft data. UV
instrumentation will be a critical tool on missions to a variety of targets in the coming decade,
especially for the rapidly expanding application of UV reflectance investigations of atmosphereless
bodies.
