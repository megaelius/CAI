This work is aimed towards facilitating the interpretation of cloudiness, effective temperatures
and rotational velocities of brown dwarfs (BDs) from their polarization measurements. An envelope
of scatterers like free-electrons, atoms/molecules, or haze/clouds affects the Stokes-vector
of radiation emitted by an oblate body. Due to high rotation rates, BDs are often considerably oblate.
We present a conics-based radiative transfer (RT) scheme for computing the disc-resolved and disc-integrated
polarized emission of an oblate body like a BD or extrasolar giant planet (EGP) bearing homogenous
or patchy clouds. We theoretically examine the photo-polarimetric sensitivity to the scattering
properties of the BD atmosphere, like cloud optical thickness and grain-size, concurrently with
BD properties, like oblateness and inclination. We present a detailed examination of gravitational
darkening (GD), revealing that it significantly amplifies disc-integrated polarization. GD
imparts a temperature-dependence to the polarization, increasing with decreasing temperature.
Photopolarimetric observations are sensitive to oblateness and inclination, with the degree-of-polarization
(DoP) increasing in response to both, a potentially useful property for assessing the spatial orientation
of the BD. Examination of BD cloud properties shows a blueward shift in near-infrared (NIR) colors
for increasing droplet size in optically thick clouds --- interesting in view of the observed relative
NIR brightening in the J-band for L/T transition BDs. For large cloud grains, the polarization decreases
sharply, while the transmitted intensity shows a steady increase, thereby reducing the DoP. BD
polarization is thus a potential indicator not only of the presence of clouds but also provides information
on cloud grain size.
