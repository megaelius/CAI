Rotation measure (RM) synthesis is a widely used polarization processing algorithm for reconstructing
polarized structures along the line of sight. Performing RM synthesis on large datasets produced
by telescopes like LOFAR can be computationally intensive as the computational cost is proportional
to the product of the number of input frequency channels, the number of output Faraday depth values
to be evaluated and the number of lines of sight present in the data cube. The required computational
cost is likely to get worse due to the planned large area sky surveys with telescopes like the Low Frequency
Array (LOFAR), the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), and eventually the Square Kilometre Array
(SKA). The massively parallel General Purpose Graphical Processing Units (GPGPUs) can be used
to execute some of the computationally intensive astronomical image processing algorithms including
RM synthesis. In this paper, we present a GPU-accelerated code, called cuFFS or CUDA-accelerated
Fast Faraday Synthesis, to perform Faraday rotation measure synthesis. Compared to a fast single-threaded
and vectorized CPU implementation, depending on the structure and format of the data cubes, our
code achieves an increase in speed of up to two orders of magnitude. During testing, we noticed that
the disk I/O when using the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) data format is a major bottleneck
and to reduce the time spent on disk I/O, our code supports the faster HDFITS format in addition to
the standard FITS format. The code is written in C with GPU-acceleration achieved using Nvidia's
CUDA parallel computing platform. The code is available at https://github.com/sarrvesh/cuFFS.
