While graphical records of astronomical/meteorological events before telescopic observations
are of particular interest, they have frequently undergone multiple copying and may have been modified
from the original. Here, we analyze a graphical record of the cross-sign of 806 CE in the Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle, which has been considered one of the earliest datable halo drawings in British records,
whereas another cross-sign in 776 CE has been associated with the aurora. However, philological
studies have revealed the later 806 event is derived from Continental annals. Here, records and
drawings for the 806 event have been philologically traced back to mid-9th Century Continental
manuscripts and the probable observational site identified as the area of Sens in northern France.
The possible lunar halos at that time have been comprehensively examined by numerical ray tracing.
Combined with calculations of twilight sky brightness, they identify a visibility window supporting
monastic observation. Cruciform halos are shown to be fainter and rarer than brighter and more commonplace
lunar halos. Physically credible cloud ice crystal variations can reproduce all the manuscript
renditions. The manuscript records prove less than desirable detail but what is presented is fully
consistent with a lunar halo interpretation. Finally, the possible societal impacts of such celestial
events have been mentioned in the context of contemporary coins in Anglo-Saxon England and the Carolingian
Empire. These analyses show that we need to trace their provenance back as far as possible, to best
reconstruct the original event, even if graphical records are available for given astronomical/meteorological
events.
