Following the discovery of the T8 subdwarf WISEJ200520.38+542433.9 (Wolf 1130C), with common
proper motion to a binary (Wolf 1130AB) consisting of an M subdwarf and a white dwarf, we set out to
learn more about the old binary in the system. We find that the A and B components of Wolf 1130 are tidally
locked, which is revealed by the coherence of more than a year of V band photometry phase folded to
the derived orbital period of 0.4967 days. Forty new high-resolution, near-infrared spectra obtained
with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) provide radial velocities and a projected
rotational velocity (v sin i) of 14.7 +/- 0.7 km/s for the M subdwarf. In tandem with a Gaia parallax-derived
radius and verified tidal-locking, we calculate an inclination of i=29 +/- 2 degrees. From the single-lined
orbital solution and the inclination we derive an absolute mass for the unseen primary (1.24+0.19-0.15
Msun). Its non-detection between 0.2 and 2.5 microns implies that it is an old (>3.7 Gyr) and cool
(Teff<7000K) ONe white dwarf. This is the first ultramassive white dwarf within 25pc. The evolution
of Wolf 1130AB into a cataclysmic variable is inevitable, making it a potential Type Ia supernova
progenitor. The formation of a triple system with a primary mass >100 times the tertiary mass and
the survival of the system through the common-envelope phase, where ~80% of the system mass was lost,
is remarkable. Our analysis of Wolf 1130 allows us to infer its formation and evolutionary history,
which has unique implications for understanding low-mass star and brown dwarf formation around
intermediate mass stars.
