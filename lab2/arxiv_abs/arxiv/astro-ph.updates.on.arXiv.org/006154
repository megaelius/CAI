Line-of-sight kinematic studies indicate that many Galactic globular clusters have a significant
degree of internal rotation. However, three-dimensional kinematics from a combination of proper
motions and line-of-sight velocities are needed to unveil the role of angular momentum in the formation
and evolution of these old stellar systems. Here we present the first quantitative study of internal
rotation on the plane-of-the-sky for a large sample of globular clusters using proper motions from
Gaia DR2. We detect signatures of rotation in the tangential component of proper motions for 11 out
of 51 clusters at a $>$3-sigma confidence level, confirming the detection reported in Gaia Collaboration
et al. 2018 for 8 clusters. Moreover, we construct the two-dimensional rotation maps and proper
motion rotation curves, and we assess the relevance of rotation with respect to random motions ($V/\sigma\sim0.08-0.53$).
We find evidence of a correlation between the degree of internal rotation and relaxation time, highlighting
the importance of long-term dynamical evolution in shaping the clusters current properties. This
is a strong indication that angular momentum must have played a fundamental role in the earliest
phases of cluster formation. Finally, exploiting the spatial information of the rotation maps
and a comparison with line-of-sight data, we provide an estimate of the inclination of the rotation
axis for a subset of 8 clusters. Our work demonstrates the potential of Gaia data for internal kinematic
studies of globular clusters and provides the first step to reconstruct their intrinsic three-dimensional
structure.
