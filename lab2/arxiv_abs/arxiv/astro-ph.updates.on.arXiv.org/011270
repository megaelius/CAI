Line-intensity mapping of the 21cm line is a powerful probe of large scale structure at z<6, tracing
large-scale structure via neutral hydrogen content that is found within galaxies. In principle,
it enables cost-efficient surveys of the matter distribution up to z~6, unlocking orders of magnitude
more modes for observational cosmology. Canada has been a traditional leader in this field, having
led the first detections of the cosmological 21cm signal via cross-correlations with optical galaxy
surveys and having constructed the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). The
field is now entering a new era where data is abundant, allowing studies in how to overcome systematics
to be tackled in an empirical, head-on fashion. In the next few years, this will produce the first
detection of the 21cm auto power spectrum, which will pave the way towards a large suite of scientific
possibilities. These potentially include precision measurements on the dark energy equation
of state and other LCDM parameters, constraints on how HI mass traces dark matter, a detection of
neutrino effects on large-scale structure, and the use of 21cm lensing to further constrain cosmology.
To turn these promising directions into reality, we recommend a sustained program of investment
in 21cm cosmology, starting with funding for the Canadian Hydrogen Observatory and Radio transient
Detector (CHORD), followed by small-scale development efforts targeting next-generation hardware
and sustained support for theory and technical staff support. Additionally, Canada should invest
in complementary line-intensity mapping efforts (such as with CO or [CII] lines) and maintain participation
in next-generation international efforts such as the Packed Ultra-wideband Mapping Array (PUMA)
and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).
