A star's UV emission can greatly affect the atmospheric chemistry and physical properties of closely
orbiting planets with the potential for severe mass loss. In particular, the Lyman-alpha emission
line at 1216 Angstroms, which dominates the far-ultraviolet spectrum, is a major source of photodissociation
of important atmospheric molecules such as water and methane. The intrinsic flux of Lyman-alpha,
however, cannot be directly measured due to the absorption of neutral hydrogen in the interstellar
medium and contamination by geocoronal emission. To date, reconstruction of the intrinsic Lyman-alpha
line based on Hubble Space Telescope spectra has been accomplished for 46 FGKM nearby stars, 28 of
which have also been observed by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX). Our investigation provides
a correlation between published intrinsic Lyman-alpha and GALEX far- and near-ultraviolet chromospheric
fluxes for K and M stars. The negative correlations between the ratio of the Lyman-alpha to the GALEX
fluxes reveal how the relative strength of Lyman-alpha compared to the broadband fluxes weakens
as the FUV and NUV excess flux increase. We also correlate GALEX fluxes with the strong near-ultraviolet
Mg II h+k spectral emission lines formed at lower chromospheric temperatures than Lyman-alpha.
The reported correlations provide estimates of intrinsic Lyman-alpha and Mg II fluxes for the thousands
of K and M stars in the archived GALEX all-sky surveys. These will constrain new stellar upper-atmosphere
models for cool stars and provide realistic inputs to models describing exoplanetary photochemistry
and atmospheric evolution in the absence of ultraviolet spectroscopy.
