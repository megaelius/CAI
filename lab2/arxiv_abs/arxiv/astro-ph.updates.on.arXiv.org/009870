Exoplanet properties crucially depend on their host stars' parameters. In case the exoplanet host
star shows pulsations, asteroseismology can be used for an improved description of the stellar
parameters. We aim to revisit the pulsational properties of beta Pic and identify its pulsation
modes from normalised amplitudes in five different passbands. We also investigate the potential
presence of a magnetic field. We conduct a frequency analysis using three seasons of BRITE-Constellation
observations in the BRITE blue and red filters, the ~620-day long bRing light curve and the nearly
8-year long SMEI photometric time series. We calculate normalised amplitudes using all passbands
including previously published values obtained from ASTEP observations. We investigate the magnetic
properties of beta Pic using spectropolarimetric observations conducted with the HARPSpol instrument.
Using 2D rotating models, we fit the normalised amplitudes and frequencies through Monte Carlo
Markov Chains. We identify 15 pulsation frequencies in the range from 34 to 55c/d, where two display
clear amplitude variability. We use the normalised amplitudes in up to five passbands to identify
the modes as three l = 1, six l = 2 and six l = 3 modes. beta Pic is shown to be non-magnetic with an upper
limit of the possible undetected dipolar field of 300G. Multiple fits to the frequencies and normalised
amplitudes are obtained including one with a near equator-on inclination for beta Pic, which corresponds
to our expectations based on the orbital inclination of beta Pic b and the orientation of the circumstellar
disk. This solution leads to a rotation rate of 27% of the Keplerian break-up velocity, a radius of
1.497+-0.025Rsun, and a mass of 1.797+-0.035Msun. The ~2% errors in radius and mass do not account
for uncertainties in the models and a potentially erroneous mode-identification.
