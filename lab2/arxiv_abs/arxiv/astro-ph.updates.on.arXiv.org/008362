Gigaparsec scale alignments of the quasar optical polarization vectors have been proven to be robust
against a scenario of contamination by the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM). This claim has been
established by means of optical polarization measurements of the starlight surrounding the lines
of sight of the 355 quasars for which reliable optical polarization measurements are available.
In this paper, we take advantage of the full-sky and high quality polarization data released by the
\textit{Planck} satellite to provide an independent, complementary, and up-to-date estimation
of the contamination level of the quasar optical polarization data by the Galactic dust. Our analysis
reveals signatures of Galactic dust contamination at the two sigma level for about 30 per cent of
the quasar optical polarization data sample. The remaining 70 per cent of the lines of sight do not
show Galactic dust contamination above the two sigma level, suggesting low to negligible contamination
of the quasar optical polarization signal. We further found arguments suggesting that Galactic
thermal dust cannot fully account for the reported quasar optical polarization alignments. Based
on the measurements of the ratio of the polarized intensity of the dust in the submillimeter to the
degree of linear polarization of the quasar in the optical, we provide a new and independent quality
criteria to apply to the quasar optical polarization sample. We argue that, unless correction is
applied, such a criterion should be imposed on the data for future investigations in the framework
of the cosmological-scale correlations of quasar optical polarization vector orientations that
still could compete with the isotropic principle of the cosmological paradigm.
