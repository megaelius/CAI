The acoustic peaks in the angular power spectrum of cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature
and polarization anisotropies play an important role as a probe of the nature of new relativistic
particles contributing to the radiation density in the early universe, parametrized by $\Delta
N_{eff}$. The amplitude and phase of the acoustic oscillations provide information about whether
the extra species are free-streaming particles, like neutrinos, or tightly-coupled, like the
photons, during eras probed by the CMB. On the other hand, some extensions of the Standard Model produce
new relativistic particles that decouple from their own non-gravitational interactions after
neutrinos, but prior to photons. We study the signature of new relativistic species that decouple
during this intermediate epoch. We argue that the decoupling species will cause a scale-dependent
change in the amplitude and phase shift of the acoustic oscillations, different from the usual constant
shifts on small scales. For intermediate decoupling times, the phase and amplitude shifts depend
not only on $\Delta N_{eff}$ but the redshift $z_{dec,X}$ at which the new species decoupled. For
$\Delta N_{eff} >0.334$, a Stage IV CMB experiment could determine $N_{eff}$ at the percent level
and $z_{dec,X}$ at the $\sim 10\%$ level. For smaller values, $\Delta N_{eff}\sim 0.1$, constraints
on $z_{dec,X}$ weaken but remain $\sim 20-50\%$ for $z_{dec,X} \sim \mathcal{O}(10^3-10^4)$.
As an application, we study the contributions to $\Delta N_{eff}$ and determine the $z_{dec,X}$
values for simple implementations of the so-called $N$naturalness model.
