Aims. We investigate the transfer of energy between a standing kink mode and azimuthal Alfven waves
within an expanding flux tube. We consider the process of resonant absorption in a loop with a non-uniform
Alfven frequency profile but in the absence of a radial density gradient. Methods. Using the MHD
code, Lare3d, we model an oscillating magnetic flux tube that expands radially with height. An initially
straight loop structure with a magnetic field enhancement is relaxed towards a force-free state
before a standing kink mode is introduced. Results. We demonstrate that the transverse gradient
in Alfven frequency required for the existence of resonant field lines can be associated with the
expansion of a high field-strength flux tube from concentrated flux patches. This allows for the
conversion of energy between wave modes even in the absence of the density profile typically assumed
in wave heating models. As with standing modes in straight flux tubes, small scales are dominated
by the vorticity at the loop apex and by currents at the foot points. The azimuthal wave exhibits the
structure of the expanded flux tube and is therefore associated with smaller length scales close
to the foot points of the flux tube. Conclusions. Resonant absorption can proceed throughout the
corona, even in the absence of dense loop structures. The flux tube and MHD waves considered are difficult
to observe and our model highlights how estimating hidden wave power within the solar atmosphere
can be problematic. We highlight that, for standing modes, the global properties of field lines
are important for resonant absorption and coronal conditions at a single altitude will not fully
determine the nature of MHD resonances. We provide a new model in partial response to the criticism
that wave heating models cannot self-consistently generate or sustain the density profile upon
which they typically rely.
