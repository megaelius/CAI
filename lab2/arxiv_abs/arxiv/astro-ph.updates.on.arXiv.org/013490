Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) are excellent laboratories to study galaxy evolution in dense
Mpc-scale environments. We have observed in CO(1-0), CO(2-1), CO(3-2), or CO(4-3), with the IRAM-30m,
18 BCGs at $z\sim0.2-0.9$ that are drawn from the CLASH survey. Our sample includes RX1532, which
is our primary target, being among the BCGs with the highest star formation rate (SFR$\gtrsim100~M_\odot$/yr)
in the CLASH sample. We unambiguously detected both CO(1-0) and CO(3-2) in RX1532, yielding a large
reservoir of molecular gas, $M_{H_2}=(8.7\pm1.1)\times10^{10}~M_\odot$, and a high level of
excitation $r_{31}=0.75\pm0.12$. A morphological analysis of the HST I-band image of RX1532 reveals
the presence of clumpy substructures both within and outside the half-light radius $r_e=(11.6\pm0.3)$
kpc, similarly to those found independently both in ultraviolet and in H$_\alpha$ in previous work.
We tentatively detected CO(1-0) or CO(2-1) in four other BCGs, with molecular gas reservoirs in
the range $M_{H_2}=2\times10^{10-11} M_\odot$. For the remaining 13 BCGs we set robust upper limits
of $M_{H_2}/M_\star\lesssim0.1$, which are among the lowest molecular gas to stellar mass ratios
found for distant ellipticals and BCGs. By comparison with distant cluster galaxies observed in
CO our study shows that RX1532 ($M_{H_2}/M_\star = 0.40\pm0.05$) belongs to the rare population
of star forming and gas-rich BCGs in the distant universe. By using available X-ray based estimates
of the central intra-cluster medium entropy, we show that the detection of large reservoirs of molecular
gas $M_{H_2}\gtrsim10^{10}~M_\odot$ in distant BCGs is possible when the two conditions are met:
i) high SFR and ii) low central entropy, which favors the condensation and the inflow of gas onto the
BCGs themselves, similarly to what has been previously found for some local BCGs.
