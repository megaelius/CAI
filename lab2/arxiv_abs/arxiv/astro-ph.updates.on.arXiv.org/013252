The presence of magnetic fields in many astrophysical objects is due to dynamo action, whereby a
part of the kinetic energy is converted into magnetic energy. A turbulent dynamo that produces magnetic
field structures on the same scale as the turbulent flow is known as the fluctuation dynamo. We use
numerical simulations to explore the nonlinear, statistically steady state of the fluctuation
dynamo in driven turbulence. We demonstrate that as the magnetic field growth saturates, its amplification
and diffusion are both affected by the back-reaction of the Lorentz force upon the flow. The amplification
of the magnetic field is reduced due to stronger alignment between the velocity field, magnetic
field, and electric current density. Furthermore, we confirm that the amplification decreases
due to a weaker stretching of the magnetic field lines. The enhancement in diffusion relative to
the field line stretching is quantified by a decrease in the computed local value of the magnetic
Reynolds number. Using the Minkowski functionals, we quantify the shape of the magnetic structures
produced by the dynamo as magnetic filaments and ribbons in both kinematic and saturated dynamos
and derive the scalings of the typical length, width, and thickness of the magnetic structures with
the magnetic Reynolds number. We show that all three of these magnetic length scales increase as
the dynamo saturates. The magnetic intermittency, strong in the kinematic dynamo (where the magnetic
field strength grows exponentially) persists in the statistically steady state, but intense magnetic
filaments and ribbons are more volume-filling.
