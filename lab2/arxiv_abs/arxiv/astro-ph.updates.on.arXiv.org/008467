We study the global accretion-ejection solutions around a rotating black hole considering three
widely accepted pseudo-Kerr potentials that satisfactorily mimic the space-time geometry of
rotating black holes. We find that all the pseudo potentials provide standing shock solutions for
large range of flow parameters. We identify the effective region of the shock parameter space spanned
by energy ($\mathcal{E}_{\text{in}}$) and angular momentum ($\lambda_{\text{in}}$) measured
at the inner critical point ($x_{\text{in}}$) and find that the possibility of shock formation
becomes feeble when the viscosity parameter ($\alpha$) is increased. In addition, we find that
shock parameter space also depends on the adiabatic index ($\gamma$) of the flow and the shock formation
continues to take place for a wide range of $\gamma$ as $1.5 \le \gamma \le 4/3$. For all the pseudo
potentials, we calculate the critical viscosity parameter ($\alpha_{\text{shock}}^{\text{cri}}$)
beyond which standing shock ceases to exist and compare them as function of black hole spin ($a_k$).
We observe that all the pseudo potentials under consideration are qualitatively similar as far
as the standing shocks are concerned, however, they differ both qualitatively and quantitatively
from each other for rapidly rotating black holes. Further, we compute the mass loss from the disc
using all three pseudo potentials and find that the maximum mass outflow rate ($R^{\rm max}_{{\dot
m}}$) weakly depends on the black hole spin. To validate our model, we calculate the maximum jet kinetic
power using the accretion-ejection formalism and compare it with the radio jet power of low-hard
state of the black hole X-ray binaries (hereafter XRBs). The outcome of our results indicate that
XRBs along the `outliers' track might be rapidly rotating.
