We use Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of H30$\alpha$ (231.90
GHz) emission from the low metallicity dwarf galaxy NGC 5253 to measure the star formation rate (SFR)
within the galaxy and to test the reliability of SFRs derived from other commonly-used metrics.
The H30$\alpha$ emission, which originates mainly from the central starburst, yields a photoionizing
photon production rate of (1.9$\pm$0.3)$\times$10$^{52}$ s$^{-1}$ and an SFR of 0.087$\pm$0.013
M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ based on conversions that account for the low metallicity of the galaxy and
for stellar rotation. Among the other star formation metrics we examined, the SFR calculated from
the total infrared flux was statistically equivalent to the values from the H30$\alpha$ data. The
SFR based on previously-published versions of the H$\alpha$ flux that were extinction corrected
using Pa$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$ lines were lower than but also statistically similar to the H30$\alpha$
value. The mid-infrared (22 $\mu$m) flux density and the composite star formation tracer based
on H$\alpha$ and mid-infrared emission give SFRs that were significantly higher because the dust
emission appears unusually hot compared to typical spiral galaxies. Conversely, the 70 and 160
$\mu$m flux densities yielded SFR lower than the H30$\alpha$ value, although the SFRs from the 70
$\mu$m and H30$\alpha$ data were within 1-2$\sigma$ of each other. While further analysis on a broader
range of galaxies are needed, these results are instructive of the best and worst methods to use when
measuring SFR in low metallicity dwarf galaxies like NGC 5253.
