We study the tidal evolution of galaxies in the most massive cluster of the IllustrisTNG-100 simulation.
For the purpose of this work we select 112 galaxies with the largest stellar masses at present and
follow their properties in time. Using their orbital history we divide the sample into unevolved
(infalling), weakly evolved (with one pericenter passage) and strongly evolved (with multiple
pericenters). The samples are clearly separated by the value of the integrated tidal force from
the cluster the galaxies experienced during their entire evolution and their properties depend
strongly on this quantity. As a result of tidal stripping, the galaxies of the weakly evolved sample
lost between 10 and 80% of their dark mass and less than 10% of stars, while those in the strongly evolved
one more than 70% of dark and between 10 and 55% of stellar mass, and are significantly less or even
not dark matter dominated. While 33% of the infalling galaxies do not contain any gas, this fraction
increases to 67% for the weakly evolved and to 100% for the strongly evolved sample. The strongly
evolved galaxies lose their gas earlier and faster (within 2-6 Gyr) but the process can take up to
4 Gyr from the first pericenter passage. These galaxies are redder and more metal rich, and at redshift
z=0.5 the population of galaxies in the cluster becomes predominantly red. As a result of tidal stirring,
the morphology of the galaxies evolves from oblate to prolate and their rotation is diminished thus
the morphology-density relation is reproduced in the simulated cluster. The strongly evolved
sample contains at least six convincing examples of tidally induced bars and six more galaxies that
had their bars enhanced by their interaction with the cluster.
