Whether extant life exists in the martian subsurface is an open question. High concentrations of
photochemically produced CO and H2 in the otherwise oxidizing martian atmosphere represent untapped
sources of biologically useful free energy. These out-of-equilibrium species diffuse into the
regolith, so subsurface microbes could use them as a source of energy and carbon. Indeed, CO oxidation
and methanogenesis are relatively simple and evolutionarily ancient metabolisms on Earth. Consequently,
assuming CO- or H2- consuming metabolisms would evolve on Mars, the persistence of CO and H2 in the
martian atmosphere set limits on subsurface metabolic activity. Here, we constrain such maximum
subsurface metabolic activity on Mars using a 1-D photochemical model with a hypothetical global
biological sink on atmospheric CO and H2. We increase the biological sink until the model atmospheric
composition diverges from observed abundances. We find maximum biological downward subsurface
sinks of 1.5e8 molecules/cm^2/s for CO and 1.9e8 molecules/cm^2/s for H2. These covert to a maximum
metabolizing biomass of <10^27 cells or <2e11 kg, equivalent to <1e-4 to 1e-5 of Earth's biomass,
depending on the terrestrial estimate. Diffusion calculations suggest this upper biomass limit
applies to the top few kilometers of the martian crust in communication with the atmosphere at low
to mid latitudes. This biomass limit is more robust than previous estimates because we test multiple
possible chemoautotrophic ecosystems over a broad parameter space of tunable model variables
using an updated photochemical model with precise atmospheric concentrations and uncertainties
from Curiosity. Our results of sparse or absent life in the martian subsurface also demonstrate
how the atmospheric redox pairs of CO-O2 and H2-O2 may constitute antibiosignatures, which may
be relevant to excluding life on exoplanets.
