We present combined observations of the $\mathrm{NH}_3~(J,K)=(1,1)$ and $(2,2)$ inversion transitions
towards OMC1 in Orion A obtained by the $\textit{Karl G. Jansky}$ Very Large Array (VLA) and the $100$m
$\textit{Robert C. Byrd}$ Green Bank Telescope (GBT). With an angular resolution of $6"$ (0.01
pc), these observations reveal with unprecedented detail the complex filamentary structure extending
north of the active Orion BN/KL region in a field covering $\sim 6'\times 7'$. We find a 0.012 pc wide
filament within OMC1, with an aspect ratio of $\sim$37:1, that was missed in previous studies. Its
orientation is directly compared to the relative orientation of the magnetic field from the $\textit{James
Clerk Maxwell}$ Telescope BISTRO survey in Orion A. We find a small deviation of $\sim11${\deg}
between the mean orientation of the filament and the magnetic field, suggesting that they are almost
parallel to one another. The filament's column density is estimated to be 2-3 orders of magnitude
larger than the filaments studied with $\textit{Herschel}$ and is possibly self-gravitating
given the low values of turbulence found. We further produce maps of the gas kinematics by forward
modeling the hyperfine structure of the $\mathrm{NH}_3~(J,K)=(1,1)$ and $(2,2)$ lines. The resulting
distribution of velocity dispersions peaks at $\sim0.5~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$, close to the subsonic
regime of the gas. This value is about $0.2~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ smaller than previously measured
in single-dish observations of the same region, suggesting that higher angular and spectral resolution
observations will identify even lower velocity dispersions that might reach the subsonic turbulence
regime in dense gas filaments.
