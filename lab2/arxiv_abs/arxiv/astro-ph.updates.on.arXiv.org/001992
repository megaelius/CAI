We present an extensive study of the environment of galaxies with bars in the low-redshift Universe,
using a volume-limited sample of over 30,000 galaxies drawn from the SDSS. We use four different
statistics to quantify the environment of our galaxies: the projected two-point cross-correlation
function, the background-subtracted number count of neighbour galaxies, the overdensity of the
local environment, and the membership of our galaxies to galaxy groups to segregate central and
satellite systems. We apply these statistics to bars with different lengths and different host
galaxy types, and we compare these to the same statistics applied to control samples of unbarred
galaxies. For barred galaxies as a whole we find very weak or no difference in all the quantities compared
to unbarred galaxies of similar mass, color and surface density. When we split our sample according
to the morphological type of their host galaxies, we see a weak but significant trend for early-type
galaxies with a bar to be more strongly clustered on scales from a few 100 kpc to 1 Mpc, when compared
to early-type galaxies without a bar. This indicates that the presence of a bar in early-type galaxies
depends on the location within their host dark matter halos. This is confirmed by the group catalog
in the sense that for early-types, the fraction of central galaxies is smaller if they have a bar.
For late-type galaxies, we find less neighbours within 50 kpc around the barred galaxies when compared
to unbarred galaxies form the control sample, suggesting that tidal forces from close companions
suppress the formation/growth of bars. Finally, we find no obvious correlation between overdensity
and the bars in our sample, showing that galactic bars are not obviously linked to the large-scale
structure of the Universe.
