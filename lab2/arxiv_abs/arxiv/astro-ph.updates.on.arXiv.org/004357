The Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature data are best fit with a LCDM model that
is in mild tension with constraints from other cosmological probes. The South Pole Telescope (SPT)
2540 $\text{deg}^2$ SPT-SZ survey offers measurements on sub-degree angular scales (multipoles
$650 \leq \ell \leq 2500$) with sufficient precision to use as an independent check of the Planck
data. Here we build on the recent joint analysis of the SPT-SZ and Planck data in \citet{hou17} by
comparing LCDM parameter estimates using the temperature power spectrum from both data sets in
the SPT-SZ survey region. We also restrict the multipole range used in parameter fitting to focus
on modes measured well by both SPT and Planck, thereby greatly reducing sample variance as a driver
of parameter differences and creating a stringent test for systematic errors. We find no evidence
of systematic errors from such tests. When we expand the maximum multipole of SPT data used, we see
low-significance shifts in the angular scale of the sound horizon and the physical baryon and cold
dark matter densities, with a resulting trend to higher Hubble constant. When we compare SPT and
Planck data on the SPT-SZ sky patch to Planck full-sky data but keep the multipole range restricted,
we find differences in the parameters $n_s$ and $A_se^{-2\tau}$. We perform further checks, investigating
instrumental effects and modeling assumptions, and we find no evidence that the effects investigated
are responsible for any of the parameter shifts. Taken together, these tests reveal no evidence
for systematic errors in SPT or Planck data in the overlapping sky coverage and multipole range and,
at most, weak evidence for a breakdown of LCDM or systematic errors influencing either the Planck
data outside the SPT-SZ survey area or the SPT data at $\ell >2000$.
