The main goal of the EXOZODI survey is to detect and characterize circumstellar dust and to propose
the first statistical study of exozodiacal disks in the near-infrared using telescopes in both
hemispheres. For this purpose, Ertel et al. have conducted in 2012 a survey of nearby main sequence
stars with VLTI/PIONIER to search for the presence of circumstellar dust. This survey, carried
out during 12 nights, comprises about 100 stars. For each star, we obtained typically three OBs and
we searched for circumstellar emission based on the measurement of squared visibilities at short
baselines. A drop in the measured visibilities with respect to the expected photospheric visibility
indicates the presence of resolved emission around the target star. It is however generally not
possible to conclude on the morphology of the detected emission based solely on the squared visibilities.
Here, we focus on closure phases to search for faint companions around the whole sample. Indeed,
to derive robust statistics on the occurrence rate of bright exozodiacal disks, we need to discriminate
between companions and disks. For this reason, the main goal of this paper is to discriminate between
circumstellar disks (which show no closure phase provided that they are point-symmetric) and faint
companions (point-like sources, creating non-zero closure phases). We also aim to reveal new companions
that do not necessarily produce a significant signature in the squared visibilities, as the signature
of the companion may show up more prominently in the closure phases. In this process, we reveal four
new stellar companions with contrasts ranging from 2% to 95% (i.e., up to equal flux binaries). We
also tentatively detect faint companions around one other target that will require follow-up observations
to be confirmed or infirmed. We discuss the implications of these discoveries on the results of the
exozodi survey.
