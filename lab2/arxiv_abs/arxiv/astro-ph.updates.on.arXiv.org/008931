Recently, the characteristics, and dynamics of a persistent 1.7 h vortex flow, resembling a small-scale
tornado, have been investigated with ground-base and space-based observations and for the first
time in the Ha line centre. The vortex flow showed significant substructure in the form of several
intermittent chromospheric swirls. We investigate the oscillatory behaviour of various physical
parameters in the vortex area, with a 2D wavelet analysis performed within the vortex flow area and
in a quiet-Sun region (for comparison), using the same high spatial and temporal resolution Ha and
Ca II 8542 CRISP observations, as well as Doppler velocities and FWHM derived from the Ha line profiles.
The vortex flow shows significant oscillatory power in the 3-5 min range that peaks around 4 min and
behaves differently than the reference quiet-Sun region. Oscillations reflect the cumulative
action of different components such as swaying motions, rotation, and waves. The derived swaying
motion periods are in the range of 200-220 s, and the rotation periods are ~270 s for Ha and ~215 s for
Ca II. Periods increase with atmospheric height and seem to decrease with radial distance from the
vortex centre, suggesting a deviation from a rigid rotation. The behaviour of power within the vortex
flow as a function of period and height implies the existence of evanescent waves and the excitation
of different types of waves, such as magnetoacoustic (e.g. kink) or Alfven waves. The vortex flow
seems to be dominated by two motions: a transverse (swaying) motion, and a rotational motion while
oscillations point to the propagation of waves within it. Nearby fibril-like flows could play an
important role in the rotational modulation of the vortex flow. Indirect evidence exists that the
structure is magnetically supported while the central swirl seems to be acting as a "central engine"
to the vortex flow.
