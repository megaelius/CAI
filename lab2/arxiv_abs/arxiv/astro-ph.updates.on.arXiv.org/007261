It is generally accepted that linear theory of growth of structure under gravity produces a squashed
structure in the two-point correlation function (2PCF) along the line of sight (LoS). On the other
hand, the observed radial spread out structure known as Finger of God (FoG) is attributed to non-linear
effects, like virial relaxation or random motions in the inner regions of galaxy clusters, or non-linear
terms in collapse theory. In this paper we argue that the squashed structure associated with the
redshift-space ($s-$) linear theory 2PCF is obtained only when this function is displayed in real-space
($r-$), or when the mapping from $r-$ to $s-$space is trivialized by one of a series of approximations:
the "wide separation" sometimes mistaken by the "distant observer", the $\mu(r) \sim \mu(s)$ in
the cosine of the position vector with the LoS, or plainly by approximating $s \sim r$. To display
the $s-$space 2PCF properly in a grid in $s-$space requires one to solve for the mapping function
$\bm s(\bm r)$ and its inverse, which exists in the small gravitational disturbance case. We find
this mapping by using plane of the sky projections of the $r-$ and $s-$ 2PCFs in the simplest case of
the linear Kaiser spectrum with a conservative power-law $r-$space 2PCF. We show that even in this
simple case, a structure quite similar to the FoG is observed in the small scale region, while in the
large scale the expected squashed structure is obtained. We show that the observed structure is
a function of three parameters: the dimensionless growth rate for visible matter ($\beta$), the
power-law exponent ($\gamma$) and the cosmological distortion given by the Alcock-Paczy{\'n}ski
parameter ($AP$). We conclude that there appears to be the way of discerning between cosmological
and gravitational redshift distortions avoiding known degeneracies.
