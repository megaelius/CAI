Extended main sequence turn-off (eMSTO) regions are a common feature in color-magnitude diagrams
of young and intermediate-age star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The nature of eMSTOs remains
debated in the literature. The currently most popular scenarios are extended star formation activity
and ranges of stellar rotation rates. Here we study details of differences in MSTO morphology expected
from spreads in age versus spreads in rotation rates, using Monte Carlo simulations with the Geneva
SYCLIST isochrone models that include the effects of stellar rotation. We confirm a recent finding
of Niederhofer et al. that a distribution of stellar rotation velocities yields an MSTO extent that
is proportional to the cluster age, as observed. However, we find that stellar rotation yields MSTO
crosscut \emph{widths} that are generally smaller than observed ones at a given age. We compare
the simulations with high-quality \emph{Hubble Space Telescope} data of NGC 1987 and NGC 2249,
the two only relatively massive star clusters with an age of ~1 Gyr for which such data is available.
We find that the distribution of stars across the eMSTOs of these clusters cannot be explained solely
by a distribution of stellar rotation velocities, unless the orientations of rapidly rotating
stars are heavily biased towards an equator-on configuration. Under the assumption of random viewing
angles, stellar rotation can account for ~60% and ~40% of the observed FWHM widths of the eMSTOs of
NGC 1987 and NGC 2249, respectively. In contrast, a combination of distributions of stellar rotation
velocities \emph{and} stellar ages fits the observed eMSTO morphologies very well.
