The characteristic prediction of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model of cosmological structure formation
is that the Universe should contain a wealth of small-scale structure -- low-mass dark matter haloes
and subhaloes. However, galaxy formation is inefficient in their shallow potential wells and so
we expect these low-mass haloes and subhaloes to be dark. Can we tell the difference between a Universe
in which low-mass haloes are present but dark and one in which they never formed, thereby providing
a robust test of the CDM model? We address this question using cosmological simulations to examine
how properties of low-mass haloes that are potentially accessible to observation, such as their
spatial clustering, rate of accretions and mergers onto massive galaxies and the angular momentum
content of massive galaxies, differ between a LCDM model and dark matter models in which low-mass
halo formation is suppressed. Adopting an effective cut-off mass scale M_cut below which small-scale
power is suppressed in the initial conditions, we study dark matter models in which M_cut varies
between 5e9 Msol/h and 1e11 Msol/h, equivalent to the host haloes of dwarf and low mass galaxies.
Our results show that both the clustering strength of low-mass haloes around galaxy-mass primaries
and the rate at which they merge with these primaries is sensitive to the assumed value of M_cut; in
contrast, suppressing low-mass halo formation has little influence on the angular momentum content
of galaxy-mass haloes -- it is the quiescence or violence of a halo's assembly history that has a more
marked effect. However, we expect that measuring the effect on spatial clustering or the merger
rate is likely to be observationally difficult for realistic values of M_cut, and so isolating the
effect of this small-scale structure would appear to be remarkably difficult to detect, at least
in the present day Universe.
