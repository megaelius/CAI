We report on results of imaging and spectral studies of X-ray emission from Jupiter observed by Suzaku.
In 2006 Suzaku had found diffuse X-ray emission in $1\unicode{x2013}5$ keV associated with Jovian
inner radiation belts. It has been suggested that the emission is caused by the inverse-Compton
scattering by ultra-relativistic electrons ($ \sim 50 $ MeV) in Jupiter's magnetosphere. To confirm
the existence of this emission and to understand its relation to the solar activity, we conducted
an additional Suzaku observation in 2014 around the maximum of the 24th solar cycle. As a result,
we successfully found again the diffuse emission around Jupiter in $1\unicode{x2013}5$ keV and
also point-like emission in $0.4\unicode{x2013}1$ keV. The luminosity of the point-like emission
which was probably composed of solar X-ray scattering, charge exchange, or auroral bremsstrahlung
emission increased by a factor of $ \sim 5$ with respect to 2006, most likely due to an increase of the
solar activity. The diffuse emission spectrum in the $1\unicode{x2013}5$ keV band was well-fitted
with a flat power-law function ($ \Gamma = 1.4 \pm 0.1 $) as in the past observation, which supported
the inverse-Compton scattering hypothesis. However, its spatial distribution changed from $
\sim 12 \times 4 $ Jovian radius (Rj) to $ \sim 20 \times 7 $ Rj. The luminosity of the diffuse emission
increased by a smaller factor of $ \sim 3 $. This indicates that the diffuse emission is not simply
responding to the solar activity, which is also known to cause little effect on the distribution
of high-energy electrons around Jupiter. Further sensitive study of the spatial and spectral distributions
of the diffuse hard X-ray emission is important to understand how high-energy particles are accelerated
in Jupiter's magnetosphere.
