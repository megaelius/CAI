We consider open star clusters (OSCs) with the proper motions, parallaxes, and line-of-sight velocities
calculated by various authors from Gaia DR2 data. The distance scale factor has been found by analyzing
the separate solutions of the basic kinematic equations to be $p=1.00\pm0.04.$ It shows that the
distances calculated using the parallaxes from the Gaia DR2 catalogue do not need any correction
factor. We have investigated the solutions obtained from various OSC samples differing in both
age and accuracy of their parallax and line-of-sight velocity measurements. The solution obtained
from a sample of 930 OSCs satisfying the constraints on the age logt<9 and the relative trigonometric
parallax error <30% is recognized to be the best one, with 384 OSCs in this sample having the mean line-of-sight
velocities calculated from at least three probable members of the corresponding clusters. As a
result of the simultaneous solution of all the basic kinematic equations, we have found the following
kinematic parameters from this sample: $(U,V,W)_\odot=(8.53,11.22,7.83)\pm(0.38,0.46,0.32)$
km s$^{-1}$, $\Omega_0=28.71\pm0.22$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, $\Omega'_0=-4.100\pm0.058$
km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$, and $\Omega''_0= 0.736\pm0.033$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-3}$. The linear rotation
velocity at the adopted at the adopted solar distance $R_0=8\pm0.15$ kpc is $V_0=229.7\pm4.6$
km s$^{-1}$. An analysis of the proper motions for these 930 OSCs has shown that, apart from the rotation
around the Galactic z axis, there is rotation of the entire sample around the x axis with an angular
velocity of $0.48\pm0.15$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ differing significantly from zero.
