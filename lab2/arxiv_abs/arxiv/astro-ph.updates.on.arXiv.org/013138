We present an observational study of 22 broad absorption line quasars (BAL QSOs) at $3\lesssim z
\lesssim5$ based on optical/near-IR spectroscopy, aiming to investigate quasar winds and their
effects. The near-IR spectroscopy covers the \hb\ and/or \mgii\ broad emission lines (BELs) for
these quasars, allowing us to estimate their central black hole (BH) masses in a robust way. We found
that our BAL QSOs on average do not have a higher Eddington ratio than that from non-BAL QSOs matched
in redshift and/or luminosity. In a subset consisting of seven strong BAL QSOs possessing sub-relativistic
BAL outflows, we see the prevalence of large \civ-BEL blueshift ($\sim$3100 km s$^{-1}$) and weak
\oiii\ emission (particularly the narrow \oiii$\lambda$5007 component), indicative of nuclear
outflows affecting the narrow emission-line (NEL) regions. In another subset consisting of thirteen
BAL QSOs having simultaneous observations of \mgii\ and \hb, we found a strong correlation between
3000~\AA\ and 5000~\AA\ monochromatic luminosity, consistent with that from non-BAL QSOs matched
in redshift and luminosity; however, there is no correlation between \mgii\ and \hb\ in FWHM, likely
due to nuclear outflows influencing the BEL regions. Our spectroscopic investigations offer strong
evidence that the presence of nuclear outflows plays an important role in shaping the BEL/NEL regions
of these quasars and possibly, regulating the growth of central supermassive black holes (SMBHs).
We propose that BEL blueshift and BAL could be different manifestations of the same outflow system
viewed at different sightlines and/or phases.
