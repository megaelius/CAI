We study the fraction of tidal interactions and mergers with well identified observability timescales
($f_{\rm TIM}$) in group, cluster, and accompanying field galaxies and its dependence on redshift
($z$), cluster velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) and environment analyzing HST-ACS images and catalogs
from the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS). Our sample consists of 11 clusters, 7 groups, and accompanying
field galaxies at $0.4 \leq z \leq 0.8$. We derive $f_{\rm TIM}$ using both a visual classification
of galaxy morphologies and an automated method, the $G-M_{20}$ method. We calibrate this method
using the visual classifications that were performed on a subset of our sample. We find marginal
evidence for a trend between $f_{\rm TIM}$ and $z$, in that higher $z$ values correspond to higher
$f_{\rm TIM}$. However, we also cannot rule out the null hypothesis of no correlation at higher than
68% confidence. No trend is present between $f_{\rm TIM}$ and $\sigma$. We find that $f_{\rm TIM}$
shows suggestive peaks in groups, and tentatively in clusters at $R > 0.5\times R_{200}$, implying
that $f_{\rm TIM}$ gets boosted in these intermediate density environments. However, our analysis
of the local densities of our cluster sample does not reveal a trend between $f_{\rm TIM}$ and density,
except for a potential enhancement at the very highest densities. We also perform an analysis of
projected radius-velocity phase space for our cluster members. Our results reveal that tidal interactions
and mergers (TIM), and undisturbed galaxies only have a 6% probability of having been drawn from
the same parent population in their velocity distribution and 37% in radii, in agreement with the
modest differences obtained in $f_{\rm TIM}$ at the clusters.
