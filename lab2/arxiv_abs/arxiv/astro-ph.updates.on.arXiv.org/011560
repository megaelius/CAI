We present the Star cluster Hunting Pipeline (SHiP) which can identify star clusters in GAIA DR2
data, and establish a star cluster catalog for the Galactic disk. A Friend of Friend based cluster
finder method is used to identify star clusters using 5-dimensional stellar parameters, $l, b,
\varpi, \mu_\alpha\cos\delta$, and $\mu_\delta$. Our new catalog contains 2443 star cluster
candidates identified from disk stars located within $|b|=25^\circ$ and with $G<18$ mag. An automatic
isochrone fitting scheme is applied to all cluster candidates. With a combination of parameters
obtained from isochrone fitting, we classify cluster candidates into three classes (Class 1, 2
and 3). Class 1 clusters are the most probable star cluster candidates with the most stringent criteria.
Most of these clusters are nearby (within 4 kpc). Our catalog is cross-matched with three Galactic
star cluster catalogs, Kharchenko et al. (2013), Cantat-Gaudin et al. (2018, 2019), and Bica et
al. (2019). The proper motion and parallax of matched star clusters are in good agreement with these
earlier catalogs. We discover 76 new star cluster candidates that are not listed in these 3 catalogs.
The majority of these are clusters older than log(age/yr)=8.0, and are located in the inner disk
with $|b|<5^\circ$. The recent discovery of new star clusters suggests that current Galactic star
cluster catalogs are still incomplete. Among the Class 1 cluster candidates, we find 56 candidates
for star cluster groups. The pipeline, the catalog and the member list containing all candidates
star clusters and star cluster groups have been made publicly available.
