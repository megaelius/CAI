Most adaptive optics (AO) systems using pyramid wavefront sensors (PyWFS) to estimate the phase
of the pupil field use mechanical modulation of the beam in order to increase the dynamic range in
low-order modes so the PyWFS can usefully operate at low Strehl ratio. The tradeoff for this approach
is reduced sensitivity, which, in turn, makes it difficult to attain a high Strehl ratio once the
loop has been closed. We propose an algorithm that increases the dynamic range of the PyWFS without
modulation. The proposed algorithm achieves this in two ways: 1) it allows the PyWFS to be treated
with any desired optical modeling algorithms, and 2) it employs Newton's method for nonlinear optimization
to create an estimator that is more accurate than the corresponding linear estimator. Numerical
simulations show that nonlinear optimization can make more accurate estimates of the phase of the
wavefront than the corresponding linear estimator for Strehl ratios of the input beam that are greater
than about 0.2. As the input Strehl ratio increases, so does the advantage of the nonlinear estimator
over the linear one. For example, when the input beam had a Strehl ratio of 0.4 (corresponding to a
standard deviation of the phase of about 0.96 radians), the linear estimator error had a standard
deviation of about 0.65 radians, while the nonlinear estimator error had a standard deviation of
about 0.27 radians (this depends only weakly on the noise level, assuming there is enough signal
for the PyWFS to work in the linear regime). The new algorithm can be implemented in massively parallel
modes, since the required calculations have almost no inter-dependencies. It is suggested that
the required computations can be performed quickly enough for the purposes of AO on modern computer
systems.
