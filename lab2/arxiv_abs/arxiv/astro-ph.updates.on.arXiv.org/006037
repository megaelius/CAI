In this study, we measure the response of matter and halo projected power spectra $P^{\rm 2D}_{\rm
XY}(k)$ (X, Y are matter and/or halos), to a large-scale density contrast, $\delta_{\rm b}$, using
separate universe simulations. We show that the fractional response functions, i.e., $\mathrm{d}\ln
P^{\rm 2D}_{\rm XY}(k)/\mathrm{d}\delta_{\rm b}$, are identical to their respective three-dimensional
power spectra within simulation measurement errors. Then, using various $N$-body simulation
combinations (small-box simulations with periodic boundary conditions and sub-volumes of large-box
simulations) to construct hypothetical observations of mock projected fields, we study how super-survey
modes, in both parallel and perpendicular directions to the projection direction, affect the covariance
matrix of $P^{\rm 2D}_{\rm XY}(k)$, known as super-sample covariance (SSC). Our results indicate
that the SSC term provides dominant contributions to the covariances of matter-matter and matter-halo
spectra at small scales but does not provide significant contributions in the halo-halo spectrum.
We observe that the large-scale density contrast in each redshift shell, i.e., the trace of second-derivative
tensor of the large-scale gravitational potential field, causes most of the SSC effect, and we did
not observe a SSC signature arising from large-scale tidal field, within the levels of measurement
accuracy. We also develop a response approach to calibrate the SSC term for cosmic shear correlation
function and galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, and validate the method by comparison with the light-cone,
ray-tracing simulations. Our method provides a reasonably accurate, albeit computationally
inexpensive, way to calibrate the covariance matrix for clustering observables available from
wide-area galaxy surveys, without the need to run light-cone simulations.
