When carbon is ignited off-center in a CO core of a super-AGB star, its burning in a convective shell
tends to propagate to the center. Whether the C flame will actually be able to reach the center depends
on the efficiency of extra mixing beneath the C convective shell. Whereas thermohaline mixing is
too inefficient to interfere with the C-flame propagation, convective boundary mixing can prevent
the C burning from reaching the center. As a result, a C-O-Ne white dwarf (WD) is formed, after the
star has lost its envelope. Such a "hybrid" WD has a small CO core surrounded by a thick ONe zone. In
our 1D stellar evolution computations the hybrid WD is allowed to accrete C-rich material, as if
it were in a close binary system and accreted H-rich material from its companion with a sufficiently
high rate at which the accreted H would be processed into He under stationary conditions, assuming
that He could then be transformed into C. When the mass of the accreting WD approaches the Chandrasekhar
limit, we find a series of convective Urca shell flashes associated with high abundances of 23Na
and 25Mg. They are followed by off-center C ignition leading to convection that occupies almost
the entire star. To model the Urca processes, we use the most recent well-resolved data for their
reaction and neutrino-energy loss rates. Because of the emphasized uncertainty of the convective
Urca process in our hybrid WD models of SN Ia progenitors, we consider a number of their potentially
possible alternative instances for different mixing assumptions, all of which reach a phase of
explosive C ignition, either off or in the center. Our hybrid SN Ia progenitor models have much lower
C to O abundance ratios at the moment of the explosive C ignition than their pure CO counterparts,
which may explain the observed diversity of the SNe Ia.
