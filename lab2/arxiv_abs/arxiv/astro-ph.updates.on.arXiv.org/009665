Ariel has been selected as ESA's M4 mission for launch in 2028 and is designed for the characterisation
of a large and diverse population of exoplanetary atmospheres to provide insights into planetary
formation and evolution within our Galaxy. Here we present a study of Ariel's capability to observe
currently-known exoplanets and predicted TESS discoveries. We use the Ariel Radiometric model
(ArielRad) to simulate the instrument performance and find that ~2000 of these planets have atmospheric
signals which could be characterised by Ariel. This list of potential planets contains a diverse
range of planetary and stellar parameters. From these we select an example Mission Reference Sample
(MRS), comprised of 1000 diverse planets to be completed within the primary mission life, which
is consistent with previous studies. We also explore the mission capability to perform an in-depth
survey into the atmospheres of smaller planets, which may be enriched or secondary. Earth-sized
planets and Super-Earths with atmospheres heavier than H/He will be more challenging to observe
spectroscopically. However, by studying the time required to observe ~110 Earth-sized/Super-Earths,
we find that Ariel could have substantial capability for providing in-depth observations of smaller
planets. Trade-offs between the number and type of planets observed will form a key part of the selection
process and this list of planets will continually evolve with new exoplanet discoveries replacing
predicted detections. The Ariel target list will be constantly updated and the MRS re-selected
to ensure maximum diversity in the population of planets studied during the primary mission life.
