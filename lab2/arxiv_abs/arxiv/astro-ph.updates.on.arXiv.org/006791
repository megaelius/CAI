Spectral features in the observed spectra of exoplanets depend on the composition of their atmospheres.
A good knowledge of the main atmospheric processes that drive the chemical distribution is therefore
essential to interpret exoplanetary spectra. An atmosphere reaches chemical equilibrium if the
rates of the forward and backward chemical reactions converge to the same value. However, there
are atmospheric processes, such as atmospheric transport, that destabilize this equilibrium.
In this work we study the changes in composition driven by a 3D wind field in WASP-43b using our Global
Circulation Model, THOR. Our model uses validated temperature- and pressure-dependent chemical
timescales that allow us to explore the disequilibrium chemistry of CO, CO$_2$, H$_2$O and CH$_4$.
In WASP-43b the formation of the equatorial jet has an important impact in the chemical distribution
of the different species across the atmosphere. At low latitudes the chemistry is longitudinally
quenched, except for CO$_2$ at solar abundances. The polar vortexes have a distinct chemical distribution
since these are regions with lower temperature and atmospheric mixing. Vertical and latitudinal
mixing have a secondary impact in the chemical transport. We determine graphically the effect of
disequilibrium on observed emission spectra. Our results do not show any significant differences
in the emission spectra between the equilibrium and disequilibrium solutions for C/O = 0.5. However,
if C/O is increased to 2.0, differences in the spectra due to the disequilibrium chemistry of CH$_4$
become non-negligible. In some spectral ranges the emission spectra can have more than 15$\%$ departures
from the equilibrium solution.
