We study the enrichment histories for nine elements, C, four alpha-elements of Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti,
Sc, and three iron-peak elements of Co, Ni, and Zn, by using a large number of stellar data, collected
by the Stellar Abundances for Galactic Archaeology (SAGA) database. We find statistically significant
changes, or breaks, of the mean abundance ratios to iron at three metallicities of [Fe/H]-1.8, -2.2,
and -3.3. Across the first one, the mean abundance ratios decrease with the metallicity by similar
extents for all the elements with the sufficient data. Across the latter two, downward trends with
the metallicity are also detected but for limited elements, C, Co, Zn, and possibly Sc, and for two
of Co and Zn, respectively. The breaks define four stellar populations with the different abundance
patters which are dominant in each metallicity range divided by the breaks, Pop IIa, IIb, IIc, and
IId in order of increasing metallicity. We also explore their spatial distributions with the spectroscopic
distances to demonstrate that Pops IIa and IIb spread over the Galactic halo while Pops IIc and IId
are observed near the Galactic plane. In particular, Pop IIc stars emerge around [Fe/H] -2.6 and
coexist with Pop IIb stars, segregated by the spatial distributions. Our results reveal two distinct
modes of star formation during the early stages of Galaxy formation, which are associated with the
variations of IMF and the spatial distribution of remnant low-mass stars. For the two lower-metallicity
populations, the enhancements of Zn and Co indicate a high-mass and top-heavy IMF together with
the statistics on the carbon-enhanced stars. We discuss the relevance to the kinematically resolved
structures of the Galactic halo and the possible sites of these populations within the framework
of hierarchical structure formation scenario.
