Over 100 trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions for masers associated with young, high-mass
stars have been measured with the BeSSeL Survey, a VLBA key science project, the EVN, and the Japanese
VERA project. These measurements provide strong evidence for the existence of spiral arms in the
Milky Way, accurately locating many arm segments and yielding spiral pitch angles ranging from
7 to 20 degrees. The widths of spiral arms increase with distance from the Galactic center. Fitting
axially symmetric models of the Milky Way with the 3-D position and velocity information and conservative
priors for the solar and average source peculiar motions, we estimate the distance to the Galactic
center, Ro, to be 8.34 +/- 0.16 kpc, a circular rotation speed at the Sun, To, to be 240 +/- 8 km/s, and
a rotation curve that is nearly flat (a slope of -0.2 +/- 0.4 km/s/kpc) between Galactocentric radii
of 5 and 16 kpc. Assuming a "universal" spiral galaxy form for the rotation curve, we estimate the
thin disk scale length to be 2.44 +/- 0.16 kpc. The parameters Ro and To are not highly correlated and
are relatively insensitive to different forms of the rotation curve. Adopting a theoretically
motivated prior that high-mass star forming regions are in nearly circular Galactic orbits, we
estimate a global solar motion component in the direction of Galactic rotation, Vsun = 14.6 +/- 5.0
km/s. While To and Vsun are significantly correlated, the sum of these parameters is well constrained,
To + Vsun = 255.2 +/- 5.1 km/s, as is the angular speed of the Sun in its orbit about the Galactic center,
(To + Vsun)/Ro = 30.57 +/- 0.43 km/s/kpc. These parameters improve the accuracy of estimates of the
accelerations of the Sun and the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar in their Galactic orbits, significantly
reducing the uncertainty in tests of gravitational radiation predicted by general relativity.
