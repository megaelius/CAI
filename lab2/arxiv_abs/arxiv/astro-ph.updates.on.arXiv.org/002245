We present narrow- and medium-band HST imaging, with supporting data, for 8 galaxies hosting fading
AGN. These are selected to have AGN-ionized gas projected >10 kpc from the nucleus, and a significant
shortfall of ionizing radiation, indicating fading of the AGN on ~50,000-year timescales. This
paper deals with the host-galaxy properties and origin of the gas. In every galaxy, we identify evidence
of ongoing or past interactions. Several show multiple dust lanes in different orientations, broadly
fit by differentially precessing disks of accreted material. The host systems are of early Hubble
type, with one S0 and one SB0 galaxy. The gas, generally of low metallicity and lying near the galaxies'
rotation curves, is consistent with an external tidal origin, although the ionized gas and stellar
tidal features do not always match closely. Unlike the case in many radio-loud AGN, these clouds
are kinematically quiet and generally follow organized rotation curves. [O III]/H-alpha ratios
often trace distinct ionization cones. We find only a few sets of young star clusters potentially
triggered by AGN outflows. In UGC 7342 and UGC 11185, multiple luminous star clusters are seen just
within the projected ionization cones, potentially marking star formation triggered by outflows.
In some regions, lack of a strong correlation between H-alpha surface brightness and ionization
parameter indicates unresolved fine structure. Together with thin coherent filaments spanning
several kpc, persistence of these structures over their orbital lifetimes may require a role for
magnetic confinement. Overall, we find that the fading AGN occur in interacting and merging systems,
that the extended ionized gas is composed of tidal debris rather than galactic winds, and that these
host systems are bulge-dominated and show no strong evidence of triggered star formation in luminous
clusters. (Abridged)
