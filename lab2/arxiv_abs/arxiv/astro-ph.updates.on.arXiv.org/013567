Context: Pebble accretion is expected to be the dominant process for the formation of massive solid
planets, such as the cores of giant planets and super-Earths. So, far, this process has been studied
under the assumption that dust coagulates and drifts throughout the full protoplanetary disk.
However, observations show that many disks are structured in rings that may be due to pressure maxima,
preventing the global radial drift of the dust. Aims: We study how the pebble-accretion paradigm
changes if the dust is confined in a ring. Results: Planet Type-I migration is stopped in a ring, but
not necessarily at its center. If the entropy-driven corotation torque is desaturated, the planet
is located in a region with a low density of dust, which severely limits its accretion rate. If instead
the planet is near the ring's center, its accretion rate can be similar to the one it would have in a
classic (ring-less) disk of equivalent dust density. However, the growth rate of the planet is limited
by the diffusion of dust in the ring and the final planet's mass is bounded by the total ring's mass.
The DSHARP rings are too far from the star to allow the formation of massive planets within the disk's
lifetime. However, a similar ring rescaled to 5 AU could lead to the formation of a planet incorporating
the full ring's mass in less than 1/2 My. Conclusions: The existence of rings may not be an obstacle
to planet formation by pebble-accretion. However, for accretion to be effective the resting position
of the planet has to be relatively near the ring's center and the ring needs to be not too far from the
central star. The formation of planets in rings can explain the existence of giant planets with core
masses smaller than the so-called pebble isolation mass.
