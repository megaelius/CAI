This paper presents a new analysis of the thermal emission from the neutron star surface to constrain
the dense matter equation of state. It is based on the use of a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithm
combined with an empirical parametrization of the equation of state, as well as the consistent treatment
of seven neutron star quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries in globular clusters with well-measured
distances. Previous analyses have indicated that the thermal emission of these neutron stars tends
to prefer low neutron star radii, questioning basic knowledge from nuclear physics. We show that
it is possible to reconcile the thermal emission analyses with nuclear physics knowledge, with
or without including a prior on the slope of the symmetry energy $L_{\rm sym}$. We obtain radii of
the order of about 12~km without worsening the fit statistic. With an empirical parametrization
of the equation of state, we obtain the following values for the slope of the symmetry energy, its
curvature $K_{\rm sym}$, and the isoscalar skewness parameter $Q_{\rm sat}$: $L_{\rm sym}=37.2^{+9.2}_{-8.9}$
MeV, $K_{\rm sym}=-85^{+82}_{-70}$ MeV, and $Q_{\rm sat}=318^{+673}_{-366}$ MeV. For the first
time, we measure the values of the empirical parameters $K_{\rm sym}$ and $Q_{\rm sat}$. These values
are only weakly impacted by our assumptions, such as the distances or the number of free empirical
parameters, provided they are taken within a reasonable range. We also study the weak sensitivity
of our results to the set of sources analyzed, and we identify a group of sources that dominates the
constraints. The resulting masses and radii obtained are also discussed in the context of the independent
constraints from GW 170817 and its electromagnetic counterpart, AT 2017gfo.
