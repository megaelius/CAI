Mapping the intergalactic medium (IGM) in Lyman-$\alpha$ emission would yield unprecedented
tomographic information on the large-scale distribution of baryons and potentially provide new
constraints on the UV background and various feedback processes relevant for galaxy formation.
Here, we examine the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission of the moderate-density IGM due to collisional excitations
and recombinations in the presence of a UV background in the Sherwood simulation suite. We focus
on large-scale-structure filaments in which Lyman-$\alpha$ radiative transfer effects are expected
to be moderate. At low density the emission is primarily due to fluorescent re-emission of the ionising
UV background due to recombinations, while collisional excitations dominate at higher densities.
We discuss prospects of current and future observational facilities to detect this emission and
focus on VLT/MUSE for a more detailed sensitivity analysis. We construct mock MUSE observations
resembling the MUSE Hubble Deep Field South from our simulations and show that our predictions are
consistent with recent analyses of diffuse Lyman-$\alpha$ emission using MUSE at redshifts $3
< z < 6$. We find that it should be most feasible to detect the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission from filaments
in the IGM in overdense regions, somewhat surprisingly towards the high-redshift end ($z \gtrsim
4.5$) accessible by MUSE, and if narrowband widths close to the MUSE spectral resolution limit are
used. This is due to the higher densities and lower temperatures in the IGM at higher redshift. High-redshift
protoclusters therefore appear to be the ideal environment to observe filamentary structures
in the IGM in Lyman-$\alpha$ emission.
