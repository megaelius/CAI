We introduce a new mathematical tool (a direction-dependent probe) to analyse the randomness of
purported isotropic Gaussian random fields on the sphere. We apply the probe to assess the full-sky
cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature maps produced by the {\it Planck} collaboration
(PR2 2015 and PR3 2018), with special attention to the inpainted maps. To study the randomness of
the fields represented by each map we use the autocorrelation of the sequence of probe coefficients
(which are just the full-sky Fourier coefficients $a_{\ell,0}$ if the $z$ axis is taken in the probe
direction). If the field is {isotropic and Gaussian} then the probe coefficients for a given direction
should be realisations of uncorrelated scalar Gaussian random variables. We introduce a particular
function on the sphere (called the \emph{AC discrepancy}) that accentuates the departure from
Gaussianity and isotropy. We find that for some of the maps, there are many directions for which the
departures are significant, especially near the galactic plane. We also study the effect of varying
the highest multipole used to calculate the AC discrepancy from the initial value of $1500$ to $2500$.
In the case of Commander 2015, the AC discrepancy now exhibits antipodal "blobs" well away from the
galactic plane. Finally, we look briefly at the non-inpainted Planck maps, for which the computed
AC discrepancy maps have a very different character, with features that are global rather than local.
For the particular case of the non-inpainted 2018 \texttt{SEVEM} map (which has visible equatorial
pollution), we model with partial success the observed behaviour by an isotropic Gaussian random
field added to a non-random needlet-like structure located near the galactic centre.
