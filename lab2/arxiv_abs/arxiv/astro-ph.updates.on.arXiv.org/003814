We report on the development of MPI-AMRVAC version 2.0, which is an open-source framework for parallel,
grid-adaptive simulations of hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) astrophysical applications.
The framework now supports radial grid stretching in combination with adaptive mesh refinement
(AMR). The advantages of this combined approach are demonstrated with one-dimensional, two-dimensional
and three-dimensional examples of spherically symmetric Bondi accretion, steady planar Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton
flows, and wind accretion in Supergiant X-ray binaries. Another improvement is support for the
generic splitting of any background magnetic field. We present several tests relevant for solar
physics applications to demonstrate the advantages of field splitting on accuracy and robustness
in extremely low plasma $\beta$ environments: a static magnetic flux rope, a magnetic null-point,
and magnetic reconnection in a current sheet with either uniform or anomalous resistivity. Our
implementation for treating anisotropic thermal conduction in multi-dimensional MHD applications
is also described, which generalizes the original slope limited symmetric scheme from 2D to 3D.
We perform ring diffusion tests that demonstrate its accuracy and robustness, and show that it prevents
the unphysical thermal flux present in traditional schemes. The improved parallel scaling of the
code is demonstrated with 3D AMR simulations of solar coronal rain, which show satisfactory strong
scaling up to 2000 cores. Other framework improvements are also reported: the modernization and
reorganization into a library, the handling of automatic regression tests, the use of inline/online
Doxygen documentation, and a new future-proof data format for input/output
