High lithium-7 ($\mathrm{^7Li}$) abundances in giants are indicative of non-standard physical
processes affecting the star. Mechanisms that could produce this signature include contamination
from an external source, such as planets, or internal production and subsequent mixing to the stellar
surface. However, distinguishing between different families of solutions has proven challenging,
and there is no current consensus model that explains all the data. The lithium-6 ($\mathrm{^6Li}$)
abundance may be a potentially important discriminant, as the relative $\mathrm{^6Li}$ and $\mathrm{^7Li}$
abundances are expected to be different if the enrichment were to come from internal production
or from engulfment. In this work, we model the $\mathrm{^6Li}$ and $\mathrm{^7Li}$ abundances
of different giants after the engulfment of a substellar mass companion. Given that $\mathrm{^6Li}$
is more strongly affected by Galactic chemical evolution than $\mathrm{^7Li}$, $\mathrm{^6Li}$
is not a good discriminant at low metallicities, where it is expected to be low in both star and planet.
For modeled metallicities ([Fe/H]$>-0.5$), we use a "best case" initial $\mathrm{^6Li/^7Li}$
ratio equal to the solar value. $\mathrm{^6Li}$ increases significantly after the engulfment
of a companion. However, at metallicities close to solar and higher, the $\mathrm{^6Li}$ signal
does not last long in the stellar surface. As such, detection of surface $\mathrm{^6Li}$ in metal-rich
red giants would most likely indicate the action of a mechanism for $\mathrm{^6Li}$-enrichment
other than planet engulfment. At the same time, $\mathrm{^6Li}$ should not be used to reject the
hypothesis of engulfment in a $\mathrm{^7Li}$-enriched giant or to support a particular $\mathrm{^7Li}$-enhancement
mechanism.
