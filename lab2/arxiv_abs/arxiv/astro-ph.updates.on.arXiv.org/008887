Earth's earliest sedimentary record contains evidence that surface temperatures were similar
to, or perhaps even warmer than modern. In contrast, standard Solar models suggest the Sun was 25%
less luminous at this ancient epoch, implying a cold, frozen planet-all else kept equal. This discrepancy,
known as the Faint Young Sun Paradox, remains unresolved. Most proposed solutions invoke high concentrations
of greenhouse gases in the early atmosphere to offset for the fainter Sun, though current geological
constraints are insufficient to verify or falsify these scenarios. In this work, we examined several
simple mechanisms that involve the role played by Earth's spin rate, which was significantly faster
during Archean time. This faster spin rate enhances the equator-to-pole temperature gradient,
facilitating a warm equator, while maintaining cold poles. Results show that such an enhanced meridional
gradient augments the meridional gradient in carbonate deposition, which biases the surviving
geological record away from the global mean, toward warmer waters. Moreover, using simple atmospheric
models, we found that the faster-spinning Earth was less sensitive to ice-albedo feedbacks, facilitating
larger meridional temperature gradients before succumbing to global glaciation. We show that
within the faster-spinning regime, the greenhouse warming required to generate an ice-free Earth
can differ from that required to generate an Earth with permanent ice caps by the equivalent of 1-2
orders of magnitude of pCO2. Accordingly, the resolution of the Faint Young Sun problem depends
significantly on whether the early Earth was ever, or even at times, ice-free.
