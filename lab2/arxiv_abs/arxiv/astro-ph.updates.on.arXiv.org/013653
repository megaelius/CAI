Many stars do not live alone, but instead have one or more stellar companions. Observations show
that these binaries, triples and higher-order multiples are common. Whereas the evolution of single
stars and binaries have been studied extensively, the same is not true for the evolution of stellar
triples. To fill this gap in our general understanding of stellar lives, we aim to systematically
explore the long-term evolution of triples and to map out the most common evolutionary pathways
that triples go through. We quantitatively study how triples evolve, which processes are most relevant,
and how this differs from binary evolution. We simulate the evolution of several large populations
of triples with a population synthesis approach. We make use of the triple evolution code TRES to
simulate the evolution of each triple in a consistent way; including three-body dynamics (based
on the secular approach), stellar evolution and their mutual influences. We simulate the evolution
of the system up until mass transfer starts, the system becomes dynamically unstable, or a Hubble
time has passed. We find that stellar interactions are common in triples. Compared to a binary population,
we find that the fraction of systems that can undergo mass transfer is about 2 to 3 times larger in triples.
Moreover, whereas in binaries the orbits typically reach circularisation before Roche-lobe overflow,
this is not true anymore in triples. In our simulations, about 40% of systems retain an eccentric
orbit. Additionally, we discuss various channels of triple evolution in detail such as those where
the secondary or the tertiary is the first star to initiate a mass transfer event.
