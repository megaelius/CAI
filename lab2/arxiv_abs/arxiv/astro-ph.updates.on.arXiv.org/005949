We consider a planetary system consisting of two primaries, namely a star and a giant planet, and
a massless secondary, say a terrestrial planet or an asteroid, which moves under their gravitational
attraction. We study the dynamics of this system in the framework of the circular and elliptic restricted
TBP, when the motion of the giant planet describes circular and elliptic orbits, respectively.
Originating from the circular family, families of symmetric periodic orbits in the 3/2, 5/2, 3/1,
4/1 and 5/1 mean-motion resonances are continued in the circular and the elliptic problems. New
bifurcation points from the circular to the elliptic problem are found for each of the above resonances
and thus, new families, continued from these points are herein presented. Stable segments of periodic
orbits were found at high eccentricity values of the already known families considered as whole
unstable previously. Moreover, new isolated (not continued from bifurcation points) families
are computed in the elliptic restricted problem. The majority of the new families mainly consist
of stable periodic orbits at high eccentricities. The families of the 5/1 resonance are investigated
for the first time in the restricted three-body problems. We highlight the effect of stable periodic
orbits on the formation of stable regions in their vicinity and unveil the boundaries of such domains
in phase space by computing maps of dynamical stability. The long-term stable evolution of the terrestrial
planets or asteroids is dependent on the existence of regular domains in their dynamical neighbourhood
in phase space, which could host them for long time spans. This study, besides other celestial architectures
that can be efficiently modelled by the circular and elliptic restricted problems, is particularly
appropriate for the discovery of terrestrial companions among the single-giant planet systems
discovered so far.
