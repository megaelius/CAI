The averaged resonant equations of motion for the planar circular restricted three-body problem
are solved on the linearization basis taking into account also non-gravitational effects. The
averaged resonant equations are derived from Lagrange's planetary equations with additional
Gauss's terms caused by the non-gravitational effects. The time depending solution has the standard
form with exponential, quadratic, linear and constant terms. The derived solution depends on that
whether the non-gravitational effects act rotationally symmetrically around the star. In the
symmetrical case the considered non-gravitational effects are the stellar electromagnetic radiation
and the radial stellar wind (stellar radiation). In the asymmetrical case the stellar radiation
and interstellar gas flow are considered. It is investigated how well the linearization solution
describes real solution obtained from an equation of motion by a comparison of the resonant libration
frequency found analytically and numerically. It is found that the applicability of the linearization
solution mainly depends on the averaging used in the derivation of resonant equations. The averaging
is based on the assumption that variations of the orbit can be neglected in the averaged interval.
The assumption implies for the mean motion resonances that the linearization solution describes
the real evolution with best accordance close to the solution of resonant condition ($da / dt$ $=$
0). At the solution of resonant condition is the semimajor axis maximal or minimal. The variations
of other orbital elements at the solution of resonant condition shifts the best accordance from
the maxima or mimima of the semimajor axis. If the initial condition are chosen close to the resonant
condition, then practically all simple oscillatory evolutions can be suitable well approximated.
