In view of cosmological parameters being measured to ever higher precision, theoretical predictions
must also be computed to an equally high level of precision. In this work we investigate the impact
on such predictions of relaxing some of the simplifying assumptions often used in these computations.
In particular, we investigate the importance of slow-roll corrections in the computation of multi-field
inflation observables, such as the amplitude of the scalar spectrum $P_\zeta$, its spectral tilt
$n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and the non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{NL}$. To this end
we use the separate universes approach and $\delta N$ formalism, which allows us to consider slow-roll
corrections to the non-Gaussianity of the primordial curvature perturbation as well as corrections
to its two-point statistics. In the context of the $\delta N$ expansion, we divide slow-roll corrections
into two categories: those associated with calculating the correlation functions of the field
perturbations on the initial flat hypersurface and those associated with determining the derivatives
of the e-folding number with respect to the field values on the initial flat hypersurface. Using
the results of Nakamura & Stewart '96, corrections of the first kind can be written in a compact form.
Corrections of the second kind arise from using different levels of slow-roll approximation in
solving for the super-horizon evolution, which in turn corresponds to using different levels of
slow-roll approximation in the background equations of motion. We consider four different levels
of approximation and apply the results to a few example models. The various approximations are also
compared to exact numerical solutions.
