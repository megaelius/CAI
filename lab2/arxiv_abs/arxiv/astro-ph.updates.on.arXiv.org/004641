We discover a population of short-period, Neptune-size planets sharing key similarities with
hot Jupiters: both populations are preferentially hosted by metal-rich stars, and both are preferentially
found in Kepler systems with single transiting planets. We use accurate LAMOST DR4 stellar parameters
for main-sequence stars to study the distributions of short-period 1d < P < 10d Kepler planets as
a function of host star metallicity. The radius distribution of planets around metal-rich stars
is more "puffed up" as compared to that around metal-poor hosts. In two period-radius regimes, planets
preferentially reside around metal-rich stars, while there are hardly any planets around metal-poor
stars. One is the well-known hot Jupiters, and the other is a population of Neptune-size planets
(2 R_Earth <~ R_p <~ 6 R_Earth), dubbed as "Hoptunes". Also like hot Jupiters, Hoptunes occur more
frequently in systems with single transiting planets though the fraction of Hoptunes occurring
in multiples is larger than that of hot Jupiters. About 1% of solar-type stars host "Hoptunes", and
the frequencies of Hoptunes and hot Jupiters increase with consistent trends as a function of [Fe/H].
In the planet radius distribution, hot Jupiters and Hoptunes are separated by a "valley" at approximately
Saturn size (in the range of 6 R_Earth <~ R_p <~ 10 R_Earth), and this "hot-Saturn valley" represents
approximately an order-of-magnitude decrease in planet frequency compared to hot Jupiters and
Hoptunes. The empirical "kinship" between Hoptunes and hot Jupiters suggests likely common processes
(migration and/or formation) responsible for their existence.
