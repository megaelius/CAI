We present 0.15'' (~2.5pc) resolution ALMA CO(3-2) observations of the starbursting center in
NGC253. Together with archival ALMA CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) data we decompose the emission into a disk
and non-disk component. We find ~7-16% of the CO luminosity to be associated with the non-disk component
($1.2-4.2 \times 10^7$ K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$). The total molecular gas mass in the center of NGC253
is $\sim 3.6 \times 10^8$ M$_\odot$ with $\sim 0.5 \times 10^8$ M$_\odot$ (~15%) in the non-disk
component. These measurements are consistent across independent mass estimates through three
CO transitions. The high-resolution CO(3-2) observations allow us to identify the molecular outflow
within the non-disk gas. Using a starburst conversion factor, we estimate the deprojected molecular
mass outflow rate, kinetic energy and momentum in the starburst of NGC253. The deprojected molecular
mass outflow rate is in the range ~14-39 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ with an uncertainty of 0.4dex. The large
spread arises due to different interpretations of the kinematics of the observed gas while the errors
are due to unknown geometry. The majority of this outflow rate is contributed by distinct outflows
perpendicular to the disk, with a significant contribution by diffuse molecular gas. This results
in a mass loading factor $\eta = \dot{M}_\mathrm{out} / \dot{M}_\mathrm{SFR}$ in the range $\eta
\sim 8-20$ for gas ejected out to ~300pc. We find the kinetic energy of the outflow to be $\sim 2.5-4.5
\times 10^{54}$ erg and ~0.8dex typical error which is ~0.1% of the total or ~8% of the kinetic energy
supplied by the starburst. The outflow momentum is $4.8-8.7 \times 10^8$ M$_\odot$ km s$^{-1}$
(~0.5dex error) or ~2.5-4% of the kinetic momentum released into the ISM by feedback. The unknown
outflow geometry and launching sites are the primary source of uncertainty in this study.
