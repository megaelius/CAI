We analyse the SLEDs of 13CO and C18O for the J=1-0 up to J=7-6 transitions in the gravitationally
lensed ultraluminous infrared galaxy SMMJ2135-0102 at z=2.3. This is the first detection of 13CO
and C18O in a high-redshift star-forming galaxy. These data comprise observations of six transitions
taken with PdBI and we combine these with 33GHz JVLA data and our previous 12CO and continuum emission
information to better constrain the properties of the ISM within this system. We study both the velocity-integrated
and kinematically decomposed properties of the galaxy and coupled with an LVG model we find that
the star-forming regions in the system vary in their cold gas properties. We find strong C18O emission
both in the velocity-integrated emission and in the two kinematic components at the periphery of
the system, where the C18O line flux is equivalent to or higher than the 13CO. We derive an average
velocity-integrated flux ratio of 13CO/C18O~1 suggesting a [13CO]/[C18O] abundance ratio at
least 7x lower than that in the Milky Way. This may suggest enhanced C18O abundance, perhaps indicating
star formation preferentially biased to high-mass stars. We estimate the relative contribution
to the ISM heating from cosmic rays and UV of (30-3300)x10^(-25)erg/s and 45x10^(-25)erg/s per
H2 molecule respectively and both are comparable to the total cooling rate of (0.8-20)x10^(-25)erg/s
from the CO. However, our LVG models indicate high (>100K) temperatures and densities (>10^(3))cm^(-3)
in the ISM which may suggest that cosmic rays play a more important role than UV heating in this system.
If cosmic rays dominate the heating of the ISM, the increased temperature in the star forming regions
may favour the formation of massive stars and so explain the enhanced C18O abundance. This is a potentially
important result for a system which may evolve into a local elliptical galaxy.
