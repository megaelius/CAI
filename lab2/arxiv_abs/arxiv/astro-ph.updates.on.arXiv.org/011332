In this thesis, the effects of the magnetic field on neutron stars matter are studied, assuming that
the neutrons inside these stars are partially or totally paired forming neutral vector bosons.
The main effects of the magnetic field on the gas are, first, to favor the phase transition to the Bose-Eintein
condensation, and second, to split the pressure in two components, one parallel and the other perpendicular
to the magnetic axis, giving rise to anisotropic equations of state. At low densities or high magnetic
fields, the lowest pressure can be negative, and the boson system becomes susceptible to suffer
a transverse magnetic collapse. On the other hand, when the temperature is low enough, the gas can
spontaneously magnetize. The equations of state of the magnetized gas of neutral vector bosons
are applied, firstly, to study the magnetic collpase of an ideal gas of neutrons, electrons and protons
(npe gas) in which the nucleons are partially bosonized. From the results obtained, a model for the
ejection of matter out of the star and the formation of astrophysical jets is proposed. Subsequently,
the equations of state of the magnetized vector gas are used to study the magnetic field influence
on the structure (mass, radius and deformation) of Bose-Einsten condensate stars, that is, of compact
objects composed entirely by a neutron gas fully bosonized. In order to appropriately take into
account the magnetic anisotropy in the equations of state of this object, we develope a system of
equations to describe the hydrodynamic equilibrium -- the structure -- of spheroidal compact objects
starting from an axisymmetric metric. The obtained results validate the bosons self-magnetization
as a feasible source for the magnetic field of compact objects.
