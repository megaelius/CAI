We study possible systematic effects on the values of the cosmological parameters measured through
strong lensing analyses of the HFF galaxy cluster MACS J1149.5+2223. We use the observed positions
of a large set of spectroscopically selected multiple images, including those of supernova "Refsdal"
with their estimated time delays. Starting from our reference model in a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology,
published in Grillo et al. (2018), we confirm the relevance of the longest measurable time delay,
between SX and S1, and an approximately linear relation between its value and that of $H_{0}$. We
perform true blind tests by considering a range of time delays around its original estimate of $345
\pm 10$ days, as an accurate measurement of this time delay was not known at the time of analysis and
writing. We investigate separately the impact of a constant sheet of mass at the cluster redshift,
of a power-law profile for the mass density of the cluster main halo and of some scatter in the cluster
member scaling relations. Remarkably, we find that these systematic effects do not introduce a
significant bias on the inferred values of $H_{0}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and that the statistical
uncertainties dominate the total error budget: a 3% uncertainty on the time delay of image SX translates
into approximately 6% and 40% (including both statistical and systematic $1\sigma$) uncertainties
for $H_{0}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$, respectively. Furthermore, our model accurately reproduces
the extended surface brightness distribution of the supernova host, covering more than $3 \times
10^{4}$ $HST$ pixels. We also present the interesting possibility of measuring the value of the
equation-of-state parameter $w$ of the dark energy density, currently with a 30% uncertainty.
We conclude that time-delay cluster lenses have the potential to become soon an alternative and
competitive cosmological probe.
