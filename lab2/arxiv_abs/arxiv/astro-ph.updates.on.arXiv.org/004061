We summarize some applications of big bang nucleosythesis (BBN) and the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) to constrain the first moments of the creation of matter in the universe. We review the basic
elements of BBN and how it constraints physics of the radiation-dominated epoch. In particular,
how the existence of higher dimensions impacts the cosmic expansion through the projection of curvature
from the higher dimension in the "dark radiation" term. We summarize current constraints from BBN
and the CMB on this brane-world dark radiation term. At the same time, the existence of extra dimensions
during the earlier inflation impacts the tensor to scalar ratio and the running spectral index as
measured in the CMB. We summarize how the constraints on inflation shift when embedded in higher
dimensions. Finally, one expects that the universe was born out of a complicated multiverse landscape
near the Planck time. In these moments the energy scale of superstrings was obtainable during the
early moments of chaotic inflation. We summarize the quest for cosmological evidence of the birth
of space-time out of the string theory landscape. We will explore the possibility that a superstring
excitations may have made itself known via a coupling to the field of inflation. This may have left
an imprint of "dips" in the power spectrum of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background.
The identification of this particle as a superstring is possible because there may be evidence for
different oscillator states of the same superstring that appear on different scales on the sky.
It will be shown that from this imprint one can deduce the mass, number of oscillations, and coupling
constant for the superstring. Although the evidence is marginal, this may constitute the first
observation of a superstring in Nature.
