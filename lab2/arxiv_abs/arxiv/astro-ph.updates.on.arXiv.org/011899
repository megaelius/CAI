The prevalence of outflow and feedback signatures in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is a major unresolved
question which large integral field unit (IFU) surveys now allow to address. In this paper, we present
a kinematic analysis of the ionised gas in 2778 galaxies at z $\sim$ 0.05 observed by SDSS-IV MaNGA.
Specifically, we measure the kinematics of the [OIII] {\lambda}5007{\AA} emission line in each
spatial element and fit multiple Gaussian components to account for possible non-gravitational
motions of gas. Comparing the kinematics of the ionised gas between 308 MaNGA-selected AGN that
have been previously identified through emission line diagnostics and sources not classified
as AGN, we find that while 25% of MaNGA-selected AGN show [OIII] components with emission line widths
of $>$ 500 km/s in more than 10% of their spaxels, only 7% of MaNGA non-AGN show a similar signature.
Even the AGN that do not show nuclear AGN photoionisation signatures and that were only identified
as AGN based on their larger scale photoionisation signatures show similar kinematic characteristics.
In addition to obscuration, another possibility is that outflow and mechanical feedback signatures
are longer lived than the AGN itself. Our measurements demonstrate that high velocity gas is more
prevalent in AGN compared to non-AGN and that outflow and feedback signatures in low-luminosity,
low-redshift AGN may so far have been underestimated. We show that higher luminosity MaNGA-selected
AGN are able to drive larger scale outflows than lower luminosity AGN. But estimates of the kinetic
coupling efficiencies are $<$ 1% and suggest that the feedback signatures probed in this paper are
unlikely to have a significant impact on the AGN host galaxies. However, continuous energy injection
may still heat a fraction of the cool gas and delay or suppress star formation in individual galaxies
even when the AGN is weak.
