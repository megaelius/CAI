Recent high-contrast imaging surveys, looking for planets in young, nearby systems showed evidence
of a small number of giant planets at relatively large separation beyond typically 20 au where those
surveys are the most sensitive. Access to smaller physical separations between 5 and 20 au is the
next step for future planet imagers on 10 m telescopes and ELTs in order to bridge the gap with indirect
techniques (radial velocity, transit, astrometry with Gaia). In that context, we recently proposed
a new algorithm, Keplerian-Stacker, combining multiple observations acquired at different epochs
and taking into account the orbital motion of a potential planet present in the images to boost the
ultimate detection limit. We showed that this algorithm is able to find planets in time series of
simulated images of SPHERE even when a planet remains undetected at one epoch. Here, we validate
the K-Stacker algorithm performances on real SPHERE datasets, to demonstrate its resilience to
instrumental speckles and the gain offered in terms of true detection. This will motivate future
dedicated multi-epoch observation campaigns in high-contrast imaging to search for planets in
emitted and reflected light. Results. We show that K-Stacker achieves high success rate when the
SNR of the planet in the stacked image reaches 7. The improvement of the SNR ratio goes as the square
root of the total exposure time. During the blind test and the redetection of HD 95086 b, and betaPic
b, we highlight the ability of K-Stacker to find orbital solutions consistent with the ones derived
by the state of the art MCMC orbital fitting techniques, confirming that in addition to the detection
gain, K-Stacker offers the opportunity to characterize the most probable orbital solutions of
the exoplanets recovered at low signal to noise.
