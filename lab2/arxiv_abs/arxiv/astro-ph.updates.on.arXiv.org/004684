In order to study the growth and evolution of circumstellar disks around classical Be stars, we analyze
optical time-series photometry from the KELT survey with simultaneous infrared and visible spectroscopy
from the APOGEE survey and BeSS database for a sample of 160 Galactic classical Be stars. The systems
studied here show variability including transitions from a diskless to a disk-possessing state
(and vice versa), and persistent disks that vary in strength, being replenished at either regularly
or irregularly occurring intervals. We detect disk-building events (outbursts) in the light curves
of 28\% of our sample. Outbursts are more commonly observed in early- (57\%), compared to mid- (27\%)
and late-type (8\%) systems. A given system may show anywhere between 0 -- 40 individual outbursts
in its light curve, with amplitudes ranging up to $\sim$0.5 mag and event durations between $\sim$2
-- 1000 days. We study how both the photometry and spectroscopy change together during active episodes
of disk growth or dissipation, revealing details about the evolution of the circumstellar environment.
We demonstrate that photometric activity is linked to changes in the inner disk, and show that, at
least in some cases, the disk growth process is asymmetrical. Observational evidence of Be star
disks both growing and clearing from the inside out is presented. The duration of disk buildup and
dissipation phases are measured for 70 outbursts, and we find that the average outburst takes about
twice as long to dissipate as it does to build up in optical photometry. Our analysis hints that dissipation
of the inner disk occurs relatively slowly for late-type Be stars.
