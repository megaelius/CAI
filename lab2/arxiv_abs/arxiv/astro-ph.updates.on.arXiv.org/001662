Although the cosmological paradigm based on cold dark matter and adiabatic, nearly scale-invariant
primordial fluctuations is consistent with a wide variety of existing observations, it has yet
to be sufficiently tested on scales smaller than those of massive galaxies, and various alternatives
have been proposed that differ significantly in the consequent small-scale power spectrum (SSPS)
of large-scale structure. Here we show that a powerful probe of the SSPS at $k\gtrsim 10$ Mpc$^{-1}$
can be provided by the 21 cm forest, that is, systems of narrow absorption lines due to intervening,
cold neutral hydrogen in the spectra of high-redshift background radio sources in the cosmic reionization
epoch. Such features are expected to be caused predominantly by collapsed gas in starless minihalos,
whose mass function can be very sensitive to the SSPS. As specific examples, we consider the effects
of neutrino mass, running spectral index (RSI) and warm dark matter (WDM) on the SSPS, and evaluate
the expected distribution in optical depth of 21 cm absorbers out to different redshifts. Within
the current constraints on quantities such as the sum of neutrino masses $\sum m_\nu$, running of
the primordial spectral index $d n_s/d \ln k$ and WDM particle mass $m_{\rm WDM}$, the statistics
of the 21 cm forest manifest observationally significant differences that become larger at higher
redshifts. In particular, it may be possible to probe the range of $m_{\rm WDM} \gtrsim 10$ keV that
may otherwise be inaccessible. Future observations of the 21 cm forest by the Square Kilometer Array
may offer a unique and valuable probe of the SSPS, as long as radio sources such as quasars or Population
III gamma-ray bursts with sufficient brightness and number exist at redshifts of $z \gtrsim$ 10
- 20, and the astrophysical effects of reionization and heating can be discriminated.
