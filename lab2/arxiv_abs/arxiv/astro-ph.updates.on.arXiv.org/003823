To understand the origin of the dunes on Titan, it is important to investigate the material properties
of Titan's organic sand particles on Titan. The organic sand may behave distinctively compared
to the quartz/basaltic sand on terrestrial planets (Earth, Venus, Mars) due to differences in interparticle
forces. We measured the surface energy (through contact angle measurements) and elastic modulus
(through Atomic Force Microscopy, AFM) of the Titan aerosol analog (tholin). We find the surface
energy of a tholin thin film is about 70.9 mN/m and its elastic modulus is about 3.0 GPa (similar to
hard polymers like PMMA and polystyrene). For two 20 {\mu}m diameter particles, the theoretical
cohesion force is therefore 3.3 {\mu}N. We directly measured interparticle forces for relevant
materials: tholin particles are 0.8{\pm}0.6 {\mu}N, while the interparticle cohesion between
walnut shell particles (a typical model materials for the Titan Wind Tunnel, TWT) is only 0.4{\pm}0.1
{\mu}N. The interparticle cohesion forces are much larger for tholins and presumably Titan sand
particles than materials used in the TWT. This suggests we should increase the interparticle force
in both analog experiments (TWT) and threshold models to correctly translate the results to real
Titan conditions. The strong cohesion of tholins may also inform us how the small aerosol particles
({\sim}1 {\mu}m) in Titan's atmosphere are transformed into large sand particles ({\sim}200 {\mu}m).
It may also support the cohesive sand formation mechanism suggested by Rubin and Hesp (2009), where
only unidirectional wind is needed to form linear dunes on Titan.
