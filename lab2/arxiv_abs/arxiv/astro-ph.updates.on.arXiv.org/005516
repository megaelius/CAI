The Orion Star Forming Complex (OSFC) is a central target for the APOGEE-2 Young Cluster Survey.
Existing membership catalogs span limited portions of the OSFC, reflecting the difficulty of selecting
targets homogeneously across this extended, highly structured region. We have used data from wide
field photometric surveys to produce a less biased parent sample of young stellar objects (YSOs)
with infrared (IR) excesses indicative of warm circumstellar material or photometric variability
at optical wavelengths across the full 420 square degrees extent of the OSFC. When restricted to
YSO candidates with H < 12.4, to ensure S/N ~100 for a six visit source, this uniformly selected sample
includes 1307 IR excess sources selected using criteria vetted by Koenig & Liesawitz and 990 optical
variables identified in the Pan-STARRS1 3$\pi$ survey: 319 sources exhibit both optical variability
and evidence of circumstellar disks through IR excess. Objects from this uniformly selected sample
received the highest priority for targeting, but required fewer than half of the fibers on each APOGEE-2
plate. We fill the remaining fibers with previously confirmed and new color-magnitude selected
candidate OSFC members. Radial velocity measurements from APOGEE-1 and new APOGEE-2 observations
taken in the survey's first year indicate that ~90% of the uniformly selected targets have radial
velocities consistent with Orion membership.The APOGEE-2 Orion survey will include >1100 bona
fide YSOs whose uniform selection function will provide a robust sample for comparative analyses
of the stellar populations and properties across all sub-regions of Orion.
