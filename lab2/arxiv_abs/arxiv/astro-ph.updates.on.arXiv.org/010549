Using new 610 MHz and 235 MHz observations from the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in combination
with archival GMRT and Very Large Array (VLA) survey data we present the radio properties of the dominant
early-type galaxies in the low$-$richness sub-sample of the Complete Local-volume Groups Sample
(CLoGS; 27 galaxy groups) and provide results for the radio properties of the full CLoGS sample for
the first time. We find a high radio detection rate in the dominant galaxies of the low-richness sub-sample
of 82% (22/27); for the full CLoGS sample, the detection rate is 87% (46/53). The group-dominant
galaxies exhibit a wide range of radio power, 10$^{20}$ $-$ 10$^{25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ in the 235 and 610
MHz bands, with the majority (53%) presenting point-like radio emission, 19% hosting currently
active radio jets, 6% having remnant jets, 9% being diffuse and 13% having no detected radio emission.
The mean spectral index of the detected radio sources in the 235$-$610 MHz frequency range is found
to be $\alpha_{235}^{610}\sim$0.68, and $\alpha_{235}^{1400}\sim$0.59 in the 235$-$1400 MHz
one. In agreement with earlier studies, we find that the fraction of ultra-steep spectrum sources
($\alpha>$1.3) is $\sim$4%, mostly dependent on the detection limit at 235 MHz. The majority of
point-like systems are found to reside in dynamically young groups, whereas jet systems show no
preference between spiral-rich and spiral-poor group environments. The mechanical power of the
jet sources in the low$-$richness sample groups is estimated to be $\sim$10$^{42}$ $-$ 10$^{44}$
erg s$^{-1}$ with their black hole masses ranging between 2$\times$10$^{8}$ $-$ 5$\times$10$^{9}$
M$_{\odot}$. We confirm previous findings that, while radio jet sources tend to be associated with
more massive black holes, black hole mass is not the decisive factor in determining jet activity
or power.
