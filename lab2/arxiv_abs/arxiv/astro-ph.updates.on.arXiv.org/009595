INTEGRAL IBIS/ISGRI 18-60 keV observations of SS433 performed in 2003-2011 enabled the hard X-ray
phase-resolved orbital and precessional light curves and spectra to be constructed. The spectra
can be fitted by a power-law with photon index $\simeq 3.8$ and remain almost constant while the X-ray
flux varies by a factor of a few. This suggests that the hard X-ray emission is produced in an extended
quasi-isothermal hot 'corona' surrounding central parts of a supercritical accretion disc. A
joint analysis of the broadband 18-60 keV orbital and precessional light curves was performed in
the model assuming a significant Roche lobe overfilling by the optical star, up to its filling the
outer Lagrangian surface enabling mass loss through the outer Lagrangian L$_2$ point. From this
modeling, the relativistic-to-optical component mass ratio $q=M_x/M_v\gtrsim0.4\div 0.8$
is estimated. An analysis of the observed long-term stability of the orbital period of SS433 with
an account of the recent observations of SS433 by the VLTI GRAVITY interferometer enabled an independent
mass ratio estimate $q>0.6$. This estimate in combination with the radial velocity semi-amplitude
for stationary He II emission, $K_x=168\pm 18$ km/s (Hillwig et al 2004) suggests the optical component
mass in SS433 $M_v>12 M_\odot$. Thus, the mass of the relativistic component in SS433 is $M_x>7 M_\odot$,
which is close to the mean mass of black holes in X-ray binaries ($\sim 8 M_\odot$). The large binary
mass ratio in SS433 allows us to understand why there is no common envelope in this binary at the secondary
mass transfer evolutionary stage and the system remains semi-detached (van den Heuvel et al. 2017).
We also discuss unsolved issues and outline prospects for further study of SS433.
