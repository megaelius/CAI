The Milky Way's stellar disk exhibits a bimodality in the [Fe/H] vs. [$\alpha$/Fe] plane, showing
a distinct high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$ sequence whose origin is still under debate. We examine
the [Fe/H]-[$\alpha$/Fe] abundance plane in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of Milky
Way like galaxies from the NIHAO-UHD project and show that the bimodal $\alpha$-sequence is a generic
consequence of a gas-rich merger at some time in the Galaxy's evolution. The high-$\alpha$ sequence
evolves first in the early galaxies, extending to high metallicities, while it is the low-$\alpha$
sequence that is formed after the gas-rich merger. The merger brings in fresh metal-poor gas diluting
the interstellar medium's metallicity while keeping the [$\alpha$/Fe] abundance almost unchanged.
The kinematic, structural and spatial properties of the bimodal $\alpha$-sequence in our simulations
reproduces that of observations. In all simulations, the high-$\alpha$ disk is old, radially concentrated
towards the galaxy's center and shows large scale heights. In contrast, the low-$\alpha$ disk is
younger, more radially extended and concentrated to the disk mid-plane. Our results show that the
abundance plane is well described by these two populations that have been distributed radially
across the disk by migration: at present-day in the solar neighbourhood, low-$\alpha$ stars originate
from both the inner and outer disk while most of the high-$\alpha$ stars have migrated from the inner
disk. We show that age dating the stars in the [Fe/H]-[$\alpha$/Fe] plane can constrain the time
of the low-$\alpha$ sequence forming merger and conclude that $\alpha$-bimodality is likely a
not uncommon feature of disk galaxies.
