Context: Compensated-current systems are established in response to hot ion beams in terrestrial
foreshock regions, around supernova remnants, and in other space and astrophysical plasmas. Aims:
We study a non-resonant reactive instability of Alfv\'en waves (AWs) propagating quasi-parallel
to the background magnetic field $\mathbf{B}_{0}$ in such systems. Methods: The instability is
investigated analytically in the framework of kinetic theory applied to the hydrogen plasmas penetrated
by hot proton beams. Results: The instability arises at parallel wavenumbers $k_{z}$ that are sufficiently
large to demagnetize the beam ions, $k_{z}V_{Tb}/\omega_{Bi}\gtrsim $ $1$ (here $V_{Tb}$ is the
beam thermal speed along $\mathbf{B}_{0}$ and $\omega _{Bi}$ is the ion-cyclotron frequency).
The Alfv\'en mode is then made unstable by the imbalance of perturbed currents carried by the magnetized
background electrons and partially demagnetized beam ions. The destabilizing effects of the beam
temperature and the temperature dependence of the instability threshold and growth rate are demonstrated
for the first time. The beam temperature, density, and bulk speed are all destabilizing and can be
combined in a single destabilizing factor $\alpha_{b}$ triggering the instability at {$\alpha
_{b}>$ $\alpha _{b}^{\mathrm{thr}}$}, where the threshold varies in a narrow range $2.43\leq
$ $\alpha _{b}^{\mathrm{thr}}\leq $ $4.87$. New analytical expressions for the instability growth
rate and its boundary in the parameter space are obtained and can be directly compared with observations.
Two applications to terrestrial foreshocks and foreshocks around supernova remnants are shortly
discussed. In particular, our results suggest that the ions reflected by the shocks around supernova
remnants can drive stronger instability than the cosmic rays.
