We present the large-scale structure over more than 50 comoving Mpc scale at z $\sim$ 0.9 where the
CL1604 supercluster, which is one of the largest structures ever known at high redshifts, is embedded.
The wide-field deep imaging survey by the Subaru Strategic Program with Hyper Suprime-Cam reveals
that the already-known CL1604 supercluster is a mere part of larger-scale structure extending
to both the north and the south. We confirm that there are galaxy clusters at three slightly different
redshifts in the northern and southern sides of the supercluster by determining the redshifts of
55 red-sequence galaxies and 82 star-forming galaxies in total by the follow-up spectroscopy with
Subaru/FOCAS and Gemini-N/GMOS. This suggests that the structure ever known as the CL1604 supercluster
is the tip of the iceberg. We investigate stellar population of the red-sequence galaxies using
4000 A break and Balmer H$\delta$ absorption line. Almost all of the red-sequence galaxies brighter
than 21.5 mag in $z$-band show an old stellar population with $\gtrsim2$ Gyr. The comparison of composite
spectra of the red-sequence galaxies in the individual clusters show that the galaxies at a similar
redshift have similar stellar population age, even if they are located $\sim$50 Mpc apart from each
other. However, there could be a large variation in the star formation history. Therefore, it is
likely that galaxies associated with the large-scale structure at 50 Mpc scale formed at almost
the same time, have assembled into the denser regions, and then have evolved with different star
formation history along the hierarchical growth of the cosmic web.
