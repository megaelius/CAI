The number of known very high energy (VHE) blazars is $\sim\,50$, which is very small in comparison
to the number of blazars detected in other frequencies. This situation is a handicap for population
studies of blazars, which emit about half of their luminosity in the $\gamma$-ray domain. Moreover,
VHE blazars, if distant, allow for the study of the environment that the high-energy $\gamma$-rays
traverse in their path towards the Earth, like the extragalactic background light (EBL) and the
intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), and hence they have a special interest for the astrophysics
community. We present the first VHE detection of 1ES\,0033+595 with a statistical significance
of 5.5\,$\sigma$. The VHE emission of this object is constant throughout the MAGIC observations
(2009 August and October), and can be parameterized with a power law with an integral flux above 150
GeV of $(7.1\pm1.3)\times 10^{-12} {\mathrm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}}$ and a photon index of ($3.8\pm0.7$).
We model its spectral energy distribution (SED) as the result of inverse Compton scattering of synchrotron
photons. For the study of the SED we used simultaneous optical R-band data from the KVA telescope,
archival X-ray data by \textit{Swift} as well as \textit{INTEGRAL}, and simultaneous high energy
(HE, $300$\,MeV~--~$10$\,GeV) $\gamma$-ray data from the \textit{Fermi} LAT observatory. Using
the empirical approach of Prandini et al. (2010) and the \textit{Fermi}-LAT and MAGIC spectra for
this object, we estimate the redshift of this source to be $0.34\pm0.08\pm0.05$. This is a relevant
result because this source is possibly one of the ten most distant VHE blazars known to date, and with
further (simultaneous) observations could play an important role in blazar population studies,
as well as future constraints on the EBL and IGMF.
