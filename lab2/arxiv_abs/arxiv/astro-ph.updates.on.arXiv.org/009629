We study the significance of non-Gaussianity in the likelihood of weak lensing shear two-point
correlation functions, detecting significantly non-zero skewness and kurtosis in one-dimensional
marginal distributions of shear two-point correlation functions in simulated weak lensing data
though the full multivariate distributions are relatively more Gaussian. We examine the implications
in the context of future surveys, in particular LSST, with derivations of how the non-Gaussianity
scales with survey area. We show that there is no significant bias in one-dimensional posteriors
of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_{\rm 8}$ due to the non-Gaussian likelihood distributions of shear
correlations functions using the mock data ($100$ deg$^{2}$). We also present a systematic approach
to constructing an approximate multivariate likelihood function by decorrelating the data points
using principal component analysis (PCA). When using a subset of the PCA components that account
for the majority of the cosmological signal as a data vector, the one-dimensional marginal likelihood
distributions of those components exhibit less skewness and kurtosis than the original shear correlation
functions. We further demonstrate that the difference in cosmological parameter constraints
between the multivariate Gaussian likelihood model and more complex non-Gaussian likelihood
models would be even smaller for an LSST-like survey due to the area effect. In addition, the PCA approach
automatically serves as a data compression method, enabling the retention of the majority of the
cosmological information while reducing the dimensionality of the data vector by a factor of $\sim$5.
