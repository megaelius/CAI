Young dense massive star clusters are a promising environment for the formation of intermediate
mass black holes (IMBHs) through collisions. We present a set of 80 simulations carried out with
Nbody6++GPU of 10 initial conditions for compact $\sim 7 \times 10^4 M_{\odot}$ star clusters with
half-mass radii $R_\mathrm{h} \lesssim 1 pc$, central densities $\rho_\mathrm{core} \gtrsim
10^5 M_\odot pc^{-3}$, and resolved stellar populations with 10\% primordial binaries. Very massive
stars (VMSs) with masses up to $\sim 400 M_\odot$ grow rapidly by binary exchange and three-body
scattering events with main sequences stars in hard binaries. Assuming that in VMS - stellar BH collisions
all stellar material is accreted onto the BH, IMBHs with masses up to $M_\mathrm{BH} \sim 350 M_\odot$
can form on timescales of $\lesssim 15$ Myr. This process was qualitatively predicted from Monte
Carlo MOCCA simulations. Despite the stochastic nature of the process - typically not more than
3/8 cluster realisations show IMBH formation - we find indications for higher formation efficiencies
in more compact clusters. Assuming a lower accretion fraction of 0.5 for VMS - BH collisions, IMBHs
can also form. The process might not work for accretion fractions as low as 0.1. After formation,
the IMBHs can experience occasional mergers with stellar mass BHs in intermediate mass-ratio inspiral
events (IMRIs) on a 100 Myr timescale. Realised with more than $10^5$ stars, 10 \% binaries, the assumed
stellar evolution model with all relevant evolution processes included and 300 Myr simulation
time, our large suite of simulations indicates that IMBHs of several hundred solar masses might
form rapidly in massive star clusters right after their birth while they are still compact.
