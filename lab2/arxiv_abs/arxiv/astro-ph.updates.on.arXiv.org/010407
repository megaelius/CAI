Hypervelocity stars are rare objects, mostly main-sequence (MS) B stars, traveling so fast that
they will eventually escape from the Milky Way. Recently, it has been shown that the popular Hills
mechanism, in which a binary system is disrupted via a close encounter with the supermassive black
hole at the Galactic center, may not be their only ejection mechanism. The analyses of Gaia data ruled
out a Galactic center origin for some of them, and instead indicated that they are extreme disk runaway
stars ejected at velocities exceeding the predicted limits of classical scenarios (dynamical
ejection from star clusters or binary supernova ejection). We present the discovery of a new extreme
disk runaway star, PG 1610$+$062, which is a slowly pulsating B star bright enough to be studied in
detail. A quantitative analysis of spectra taken with ESI at the Keck Observatory revealed that
PG 1610$+$062 is a late B-type MS star of 4-5 $M_\odot$ with low projected rotational velocity. Abundances
(C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar, and Fe) were derived differentially with respect to the normal B star
HD 137366 and indicate that PG 1610$+$062 is somewhat metal rich. A kinematic analysis, based on
our spectrophotometric distance (17.3 kpc) and on proper motions from Gaia's second data release,
shows that PG 1610$+$062 was probably ejected from the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm at a velocity
of $550\pm40$ km s$^{-1}$, which is beyond the classical limits. Accordingly, the star is in the
top five of the most extreme MS disk runaway stars and is only the second among the five for which the
chemical composition is known.
