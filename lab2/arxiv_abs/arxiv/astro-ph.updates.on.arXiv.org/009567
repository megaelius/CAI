The origin of the disk and spheroid of galaxies has been a key open question in understanding their
morphology. Using the high-resolution cosmological simulation, New Horizon, we explore kinematically
decomposed disk and spheroidal components of 144 field galaxies with masses greater than $\rm 10^9\,M_{\odot}$
at $z=0.7$. The origins of stellar particles are classified according to their birthplace (in situ
or ex situ) and their orbits at birth. Before disk settling, stars form mainly through chaotic mergers
between proto-galaxies and become part of the spheroidal component. When disk settling starts,
we find that more massive galaxies begin to form disk stars from earlier epochs; massive galaxies
commence to develop their disks at $z\sim1-2$, while low-mass galaxies do after $z\sim1$. The formation
of disks is affected by accretion as well, as mergers can trigger gas turbulence or induce misaligned
gas infall that prevents galaxies from forming co-rotating disk stars. The importance of accreted
stars is greater in more massive galaxies, especially in developing massive spheroids. A significant
fraction of the spheroids comes from the disk stars that are perturbed, which becomes more important
at lower redshifts. Some ($\sim12.5\%$) of our massive galaxies develop counter-rotating disks
from the gas infall misaligned with the existing disk plane, which can last for more than a Gyr until
they become the dominant component, and flip the angular momentum of the galaxy in the opposite direction.
The final disk-to-total ratio of a galaxy needs to be understood in relation to its stellar mass and
accretion history. We quantify the significance of the stars with different origins and provide
them as guiding values.
