There is no complete description of the emission physics during the prompt phase in gamma-ray bursts.
Spectral analyses, however, indicate that many spectra are narrower than what is expected for non-thermal
emission models. Here, we reanalyse the sample of 37 bursts in \citet{Yu2019}, by fitting the narrowest
time-resolved spectrum in each burst. We perform model comparison between a photospheric and a
synchrotron emission model based on Bayesian evidence. We choose to compare the shape of the narrowest
expected spectra: emission from the photosphere in a non-dissipative flow and slow-cooled synchrotron
emission from a narrow electron distribution. We find that the photospheric spectral shape is preferred
by $54 \pm 8 \%$ of the spectra (20/37), while $38 \pm 8 \%$ of the spectra (14/37) prefer the synchrotron
spectral shape; three spectra are inconclusive. We hence conclude that GRB spectra are indeed very
narrow and that more than half of the bursts have a photospheric emission episode. We also find that
a third of all analysed spectra, not only prefer, but are also compatible with a non-dissipative
photosphere, confirming previous similar findings. Furthermore, we notice that the spectra,
that prefer the photospheric model, all have a low-energy power-law indices $\alpha > -0.5$. This
means that $\alpha$ is a good estimator of which model is preferred by the data. Finally, we argue
that the spectra which statistically prefer the synchrotron model, could equally well be caused
by subphotospheric dissipation. If that is the case, photospheric emission during the early, prompt
phase would be even more dominant.
