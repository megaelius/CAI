Recent studies show that the majority of blue straggler stars in old open clusters are formed through
mass transfer from an evolved star onto a main sequence companion, resulting in a blue straggler
and white dwarf in a binary system. We present constraints on the formation histories and mass transfer
efficiencies for two blue straggler-white dwarf binaries in open cluster NGC 188 resulting from
measuring white dwarf cooling temperatures and surface gravities with HST COS far-ultraviolet
spectroscopy. We determine that one system, WOCS 4540, formed through Case C mass transfer resulting
in a CO-core white dwarf with a temperature of $17200^{+100}_{-80}$ K and a $\log g$ of $7.76^{+0.03}_{-0.01}$.
These fitted values correspond to a mass of $0.50^{+0.05}_{-0.01}$ $M_{\odot}$ and an age of $94^{+7}_{-3}$
Myr. The other system, WOCS 5379, formed through Case B mass transfer resulting in a He-core white
dwarf with a temperature of $15400^{+280}_{-260}$ K and a $\log g$ of $7.45^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$,
corresponding to a mass of $0.40^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ $M_{\odot}$ and an age of $230^{+22}_{-23}$
Myr. We determine possible progenitor binary systems with a grid of accretion models using MESA,
and investigate whether these systems would lead to stable or unstable mass transfer. WOCS 4540
likely resulted from stable mass transfer during periastron passage in an eccentric binary system,
while WOCS 5379 challenges our current understanding of the expected regimes for stable mass transfer
from red giant branch stars. Both systems are examples of the benefit of using a detailed analysis
to fine-tune our physical understanding of binary evolutionary processes.
