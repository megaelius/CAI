We detected 10 compact galaxy groups (CGs) at $z=0$ in the semi-analytic galaxy catalog of Guo et
al. (2011) for the milli-Millennium Cosmological Simulation (sCGs in mGuo2010a). We aimed to identify
potential canonical pathways for compact group evolution and thus illuminate the history of observed
nearby compact groups. By constructing merger trees for $z=0$ sCG galaxies, we studied the cosmological
evolution of key properties, and compared them with $z=0$ Hickson CGs (HCGs). We found that, once
sCG galaxies come within 1 (0.5) Mpc of their most massive galaxy, they remain within that distance
until $z=0$, suggesting sCG "birth redshifts". At $z=0$ stellar masses of sCG most-massive galaxies
are within $10^{10} \lesssim M_{\ast}/M_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{11}$. In several cases, especially
in the two 4- and 5-member systems, the amount of cold gas mass anti-correlates with stellar mass,
which in turn correlates with hot gas mass. We define the angular difference between group members'
3D velocity vectors, $\Delta\theta_{\rm vel}$, and note that many of the groups are long-lived
because their small values of $\Delta\theta_{\rm vel}$ indicate a significant parallel component.
For triplets in particular, $\Delta\theta_{\rm vel}$ values range between $20^{\circ}$ and $40^{\circ}$
so that galaxies are coming together along roughly parallel paths, and pairwise separations do
not show large pronounced changes after close encounters. The best agreement between sCG and HCG
physical properties is for $M_{\ast}$ galaxy values, but HCG values are higher overall, including
for SFRs. Unlike HCGs, due to a tail at low SFR and $M_{\ast}$, and a lack of $M_{\ast}\gtrsim 10^{11}M_{\odot}$
galaxies, only a few sCG galaxies are on the star-forming main sequence.
