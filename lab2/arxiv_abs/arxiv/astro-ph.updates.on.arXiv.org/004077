As astronomers increasingly exploit the information available in the time domain, spectroscopic
variability in particular opens broad new channels of investigation. Here we describe the selection
algorithms for all targets intended for repeat spectroscopy in the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey
(TDSS), part of the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey within the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey-IV. Also discussed are the scientific rationale and technical constraints leading
to these target selections. The TDSS includes a large "Repeat Quasar Spectroscopy" (RQS) program
delivering ~13,000 repeat spectra of confirmed SDSS quasars, and several smaller "Few-Epoch Spectroscopy"
(FES) programs targeting specific classes of quasars as well as stars. The RQS program aims to provide
a large and diverse quasar data set for studying variations in quasar spectra on timescales of years,
a comparison sample for the FES quasar programs, and opportunity for discovering rare, serendipitous
events. The FES programs cover a wide variety of phenomena in both quasars and stars. Quasar FES programs
target broad absorption line quasars, high signal-to-noise ratio normal broad line quasars, quasars
with double-peaked or very asymmetric broad emission line profiles, binary supermassive black
hole candidates, and the most photometrically variable quasars. Strongly variable stars are also
targeted for repeat spectroscopy, encompassing many types of eclipsing binary systems, and classical
pulsators like RR Lyrae. Other stellar FES programs allow spectroscopic variability studies of
active ultracool dwarf stars, dwarf carbon stars, and white dwarf/M dwarf spectroscopic binaries.
We present example TDSS spectra and describe anticipated sample sizes and results.
