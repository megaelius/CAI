Off-center stellar tidal disruption flares have been suggested to be a powerful probe of recoiling
supermassive black holes (SMBHs) out of galactic centers due to anisotropic gravitational wave
radiations. However, off-center tidal flares can also be produced by SMBHs in merging galaxies.
In this paper, we computed the tidal flare rates by dual SMBHs in two merging galaxies before the SMBHs
become self-gravitationally bounded. We employ an analytical model to calculate the tidal loss-cone
feeding rates for both SMBHs, taking into account two-body relaxation of stars, tidal perturbations
by the companion galaxy, and chaotic stellar orbits in triaxial gravitational potential. We show
that for typical SMBHs with mass 10^7 M_\sun, the loss-cone feeding rates are enhanced by mergers
up to \Gamma ~ 10^{-2} yr^{-1}, about two order of magnitude higher than those by single SMBHs in isolated
galaxies and about four orders of magnitude higher than those by recoiling SMBHs. The enhancements
are mainly due to tidal perturbations by the companion galaxy. We suggest that off-center tidal
flares are overwhelmed by those from merging galaxies, making the identification of recoiling
SMBHs challenging. Based on the calculated rates, we estimate the relative contributions of tidal
flare events by single, binary, and dual SMBH systems during cosmic time. Our calculations show
that the off-center tidal disruption flares by un-bound SMBHs in merging galaxies contribute a
fraction comparable to that by single SMBHs in isolated galaxies. We conclude that off-center tidal
disruptions are powerful tracers of the merging history of galaxies and SMBHs.
