We present the Planck likelihood, a complete statistical description of the two-point correlation
function of the CMB temperature fluctuations. We use this likelihood to derive the Planck CMB power
spectrum over three decades in l, covering 2 <= l <= 2500. The main source of error at l <=
1500 is cosmic variance. Uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumental
noise dominate the error budget at higher l's. For l < 50, our likelihood exploits all Planck frequency
channels from 30 to 353 GHz through a physically motivated Bayesian component separation technique.
At l >= 50, we employ a correlated Gaussian likelihood approximation based on angular cross-spectra
derived from the 100, 143 and 217 GHz channels. We validate our likelihood through an extensive suite
of consistency tests, and assess the impact of residual foreground and instrumental uncertainties
on cosmological parameters. We find good internal agreement among the high-l cross-spectra with
residuals of a few uK^2 at l <= 1000. We compare our results with foreground-cleaned CMB maps,
and with cross-spectra derived from the 70 GHz Planck map, and find broad agreement in terms of spectrum
residuals and cosmological parameters. The best-fit LCDM cosmology is in excellent agreement
with preliminary Planck polarisation spectra. The standard LCDM cosmology is well constrained
by Planck by l <= 1500. For example, we report a 5.4 sigma deviation from n_s /= 1. Considering various
extensions beyond the standard model, we find no indication of significant departures from the
LCDM framework. Finally, we report a tension between the best-fit LCDM model and the low-l spectrum
in the form of a power deficit of 5-10% at l <~ 40, significant at 2.5-3 sigma. We do not elaborate
further on its cosmological implications, but note that this is our most puzzling finding in an otherwise
remarkably consistent dataset. (Abridged)
