IGR J17591$-$2342 is a new accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar (AMXP) that was recently discovered
in outburst in 2018. Early observations revealed that the source's radio emission is brighter than
that of any other known neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (NS-LMXB) at comparable X-ray luminosity,
and assuming its likely $\gtrsim 6$ kpc distance. It is comparably radio bright to black hole LMXBs
at similar X-ray luminosities. In this work, we present the results of our extensive radio and X-ray
monitoring campaign of the 2018 outburst of IGR J17591$-$2342. In total we collected 10 quasi-simultaneous
radio (VLA, ATCA) and X-ray (Swift-XRT) observations, which make IGR J17591$-$2342 one of the best-sampled
NS-LMXBs. We use these to fit a power-law correlation index $\beta = 0.37^{+0.42}_{-0.40}$ between
observed radio and X-ray luminosities ( $L_\mathrm{R}\propto L_\mathrm{X}^{\beta}$). However,
our monitoring revealed a large scatter in IGR J17591$-$2342's radio luminosity (at a similar X-ray
luminosity, $L_\mathrm{X} \sim 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and spectral state), with $L_\mathrm{R}
\sim 4 \times 10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ during the first three reported observations, and up to a factor
of 4 lower $L_\mathrm{R}$ during later radio observations. Nonetheless, the average radio luminosity
of IGR J17591$-$2342 is still one of the highest among NS-LMXBs, and we discuss possible reasons
for the wide range of radio luminosities observed in such systems during outburst. We found no evidence
for radio pulsations from IGR J17591$-$2342 in our Green Bank Telescope observations performed
shortly after the source returned to quiescence. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out that IGR J17591$-$2342
becomes a radio millisecond pulsar during quiescence.
