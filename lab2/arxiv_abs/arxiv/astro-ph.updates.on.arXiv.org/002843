Interferometric radius measurements provide a direct probe of the fundamental parameters of M
dwarfs, but is within reach for only a limited sample of nearby, bright stars. We use interferometrically-measured
radii, bolometric luminosities, and effective temperatures to develop new empirical calibrations
based on low-resolution, near-infrared spectra. We use H-band Mg and Al features to determine effective
temperature, radius and log luminosity; the standard deviations in the residuals of our best fits
are, respectively, 73K, 0.027Rsun, and 0.049 dex (11% error on luminosity). These relationships
are valid for mid-K to mid-M dwarfs, roughly corresponding to temperatures between 3100 and 4800K.
We apply our calibrations to M dwarfs targeted by the MEarth transiting planet survey and to the cool
Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs). We independently validate our calibrations by demonstrating
a clear relationship between our inferred parameters and the absolute K magnitudes of the MEarth
stars. We identify objects with magnitudes too bright for their inferred luminosities as candidate
multiple systems. We also use our inferred luminosities to address the applicability of near-infrared
metallicity calibrations to mid and late M dwarfs. The temperatures we infer for the KOIs agree remarkably
well with those from the literature; however, our stellar radii are systematically larger than
those presented in previous works that derive radii from model isochrones. This results in a mean
planet radius that is 14% larger than one would infer using the stellar properties from recent catalogs.
Our results confirm those of previous in-depth studies of Kepler-42, Kepler-45, and Kepler-168.
