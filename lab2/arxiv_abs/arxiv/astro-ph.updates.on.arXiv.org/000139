Blazars are powerful, variable emitters from radio to gamma-ray wavelengths. Even though the general
picture of synchrotron emission at low energies and inverse Compton at the high energy end is well
established, many important aspects of these remarkable objects are still not well understood.
For example, even the location of the gamma-ray emission region is still not clearly established,
with some theories locating it close to the black hole/accretion disk while others place it at parsec
scales in the radio jet. Since mid-2007 we have carried out a large scale monitoring program at 15
GHz using the OVRO 40 m telescope. We are currently observing about 1700 blazars twice per week. The
sample includes all the Fermi-LAT detected blazars north of declination -20 degrees. Here, we study
the existence of correlated variability between these two bands for 86 sources bright enough to
be detected weekly by LAT. The existence of correlated variability can be interpreted as an indication
of a related spatial locations for the radio and gamma-ray emission, making the evaluation of its
statistical significance a key goal of our program. A study of the statistical significance of these
cross-correlations is presented along with a discussion of the Monte Carlo simulations used to
evaluate them. More information about the conditions on the radio emission zone can be obtained
through polarization monitoring which tells us about the configuration of the magnetic fields
in this region. To study radio polarization variability we are building KuPol, a radio polarization
receiver for the 12 to 18 GHz band that will replace the current total power receiver at the OVRO 40
meter telescope.
