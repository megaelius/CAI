We study the properties of the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS) 843~MHz radio AGN population
in galaxy clusters from two large catalogs created using the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The first
contains $\sim$11,800 optically selected redMaPPer clusters (RM-Y3; $M_{200c}>10^{14}M_\odot$,
$z<0.8$) and the second contains $\sim$1,000 X-ray selected clusters from the ROSAT All Sky Survey
(MARD-Y3; $M_{200c}>2\times10^{14}M_\odot$, $z<1$). We show that cluster radio loud active
galactic nuclei (AGN) are highly concentrated around cluster centers to $z\sim1$. We measure the
halo occupation number for cluster radio AGN above a threshold luminosity, finding that the number
of radio AGN per cluster increases with cluster halo mass as $N\propto M^{1.2\pm0.1}$ ($N\propto
M^{0.68\pm0.34}$) for the RM-Y3 (MARD-Y3) sample. Using optical counterparts for these sources,
we demonstrate weak redshift evolution in the host broad band colors and the radio luminosity at
fixed host galaxy stellar mass. We use the redshift evolution in radio luminosity to break the degeneracy
between density and luminosity evolution scenarios in the redshift trend of the radio AGN luminosity
function (LF). The LF exhibits a redshift trend of the form $(1+z)^\gamma$ in density and luminosity
of $\gamma=3.0\pm0.4$ and $\gamma=0.21\pm0.15$, respectively, in the RM-Y3 sample. We use the
cluster radio galaxy LF to estimate the average radio-mode feedback energy as a function of cluster
mass and redshift and compare it to the core ($<0.1R_{500}$) X-ray radiative losses for clusters
at $z<1$. We find the imbalance of radio mode feedback and X-ray radiative losses is qualitatively
consistent with that required to explain the observed cool core population and the trend of increasing
ICM mass fraction with mass observed over the same redshift range.
