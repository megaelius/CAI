The Gravitational Wave (GW) events GW150914, GW151226, GW170104 detected by LIGO were a record
of Black Hole binary merging system (BH-BH) very probably in nearly empty or a vacuum space; such
a kind of events will be mostly with no baryon mass (plasma or dense masses) and therefore mute or blind
in any correlated gamma band. If the GWs events might be born inside a globular cluster, a star forming
region or along a spiral AGN accretion disk their additional accreting mass may be the needed baryon
load to explode and shine: in those dense places. BH BH collapse may also offer an optical X and gamma
afterglow via their baryon lightening and photon tracks. Only very nearby (tens Mpc) BH Neutron
Star (NS) or NS NS cannibal merging might be guaranteed and associated also with a desired, visible
and correlated spherical NS explosion (kilonova one); they require much lower threshold or just
nearer distances. Indeed such a very exceptional GW170817 GRB170817a event occurred last August
2017; it took place and it was related to a very first NS NS collapse in a SN kilonova spherical explosion.
The GRB170817a gamma, X, radio signature it was exceptional in many features . Its unique values
(softer, weaker, the most near and long life one) made GRB170817a very possibly an off-axis jet detection.
However there are solid arguments that suggest that such a GRB are not just blazing within a collimated
beam jet but that they are also shining in a wider spread gamma equatorial disk blazing, orthogonal
to the jet itself. In a few words we were observing the event not along its jet but mostly orthogonal
to it. This GRB170817a geometry may better explain the otherwise unexpected beamed to us event.
In this paper therefore we summarize the astrophysical and the cosmological signature of such a
long desired multiple astronomy.
