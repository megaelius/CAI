Aims: From a coherent interpretation of the linear polarisation detected in the spectral lines
of the Mira star $\chi$ Cyg, we derive information about the dynamics of the stellar photosphere,
including pulsation. Methods: From spectropolarimetric observations of $\chi$ Cyg, we perform
careful analysis of the polarisation signals observed in atomic and molecular lines, both in absorption
and emission, using the radiative transfer in the polarisation context, through two mechanisms:
intrinsic polarisation and continuum depolarisation. We also explain the observed line doubling
phenomenon in terms of an expanding shell in spherical geometry, which allows us to pinpoint the
coordinates over the stellar disk with enhanced polarisation. Results: We find that the polarised
spectrum of $\chi$ Cyg is dominated by intrinsic polarisation, with a negligible continuum depolarisation.
The observed polarised signals can only be explained by assuming that this polarisation is locally
enhanced by velocity fields. During the pulsation, radial velocities are not homogeneous over
the disk. We map these regions of enhanced velocities. Conclusions: We have set an algorithm to distinguish
in any stellar spectra of linear polarisation the origin of this polarisation and the way to increase
signal by coherently adding many lines with an appropriated weight. Applied to the Mira star $\chi$
Cyg, we reached the unexpected result that during the pulsation, velocities are radial but not homogeneous
over the disk. The reason for these local velocity enhancements are probably related to the interplay
between the atmospheric pulsation dynamics and the underlying stellar convection.
