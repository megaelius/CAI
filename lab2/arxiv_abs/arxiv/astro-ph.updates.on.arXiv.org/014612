Dusty high-z galaxies are extreme objects with high star formation rates (SFRs) and luminosities.
Characterising the properties of this population and analysing their evolution over cosmic time
is key to understanding galaxy evolution in the early Universe. We select a sample of high-z dusty
star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) and evaluate their position on the main sequence (MS) of star-forming
galaxies, the well-known correlation between stellar mass and SFR. We aim to understand the causes
of their high star formation and quantify the percentage of DSFGs that lie above the MS. We adopted
a multi-wavelength approach with data from optical to submillimetre wavelengths from surveys
at the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) to study a submillimetre sample of high-redshift galaxies. Two
submillimetre selection methods were used, including: sources selected at 850$\mathrm{\, \mu
m}$ with the Sub-millimetre Common-User Bolometer Array 2) SCUBA-2 instrument and {\it Herschel}-Spectral
and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) selected sources (colour-colour diagrams and 500$\mathrm{\,
\mu m}$ risers), finding that 185 have good multi-wavelength coverage. The resulting sample of
185 high-z candidates was further studied by spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with the
CIGALE fitting code. We derived photometric redshifts, stellar masses, SFRs, and additional physical
parameters, such as the infrared luminosity and active galactic nuclei (AGN) contribution. We
find that the different results in the literature are, only in part, due to selection effects. The
difference in measured SFRs affects the position of DSFGs on the MS of galaxies; most of the DSFGs
lie on the MS (60\%). Finally, we find that the star formation efficiency (SFE) depends on the epoch
and intensity of the star formation burst in the galaxy; the later the burst, the more intense the
star formation.
