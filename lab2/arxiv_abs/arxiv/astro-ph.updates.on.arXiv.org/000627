We present the first case in which the BEER algorithm identified a hot Jupiter in the Kepler light
curve, and its reality was confirmed by orbital solutions based on follow-up spectroscopy. The
companion KIC 4570949b was identified by the BEER algorithm, which detected the BEaming (sometimes
called Doppler boosting) effect together with the Ellipsoidal and Reflection/emission modulations
(BEER), at an orbital period of 1.54 days, suggesting a planetary companion orbiting the 13.3 mag
F star. Further investigation revealed that this star appeared in the Kepler eclipsing binary catalog
with estimated primary and secondary eclipse depths of 5e-3 and 1e-4 respectively. Spectroscopic
radial-velocity follow-up observations with TRES and SOPHIE confirmed KIC 4570949b as a transiting
2.0+/-0.26 Mjup hot Jupiter. The mass of a transiting planet can be estimated from either the beaming
or the ellipsoidal amplitude. The ellipsoidal-based mass estimate of KIC 4570949b is consistent
with the spectroscopically measured mass while the beaming-based estimate is significantly inflated.
We explain this apparent discrepancy as evidence for the superrotation phenomenon, which involves
eastward displacement of the hottest atmospheric spot of a tidally-locked planet by an equatorial
super-rotating jet stream. This phenomenon was previously observed only for HD 189733b in the infrared.
We show that a phase shift of 10.2+/-2.0 degrees of the planet reflection/emission modulation,
due to superrotation, explains the apparently inflated beaming modulation, resolving the ellipsoidal/beaming
amplitude discrepancy. KIC 4570949b is one of very few confirmed planets in the Kepler light curves
that show BEER modulations and the first to show superrotation evidence in the Kepler band. Its discovery
illustrates for the first time the ability of the BEER algorithm to detect short-period planets
and brown dwarfs.
