Aims. The fueling and feedback of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are important in understanding
the co-evolution between black holes and host galaxies. Mergers are thought to have the capability
to bring gas inwards and ignite nuclear activity, especially for more powerful AGNs. However, there
is still significant ongoing debate on whether mergers can trigger AGNs and, if they do, whether
mergers are a significant triggering mechanism. Methods. We select a low-redshift ($0.005<z<0.1$)
sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and a high-redshift ($0 < z < 0.6$) sample from the
Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We take advantage of the convolutional neural network technique
to identify mergers. We use mid-infrared (MIR) color cut and optical emission line diagnostics
to classify AGNs. We also include Low Excitation Radio Galaxies (LERGs) to investigate the connection
between mergers and low accretion rate AGNs. Results. We find that AGNs are more likely to be found
in mergers than non-mergers, with an AGN excess up to $1.81\pm{0.16}$, suggesting that mergers
can trigger AGNs. We also find the fraction of mergers in AGNs is higher than that in non-AGN controls,
for both MIR and optically selected AGNs, as well as LERGs, with values between $16.40\pm{0.5}\%$
and $39.23\pm{2.10}\%$, implying a non-negligible to potentially significant role of mergers
in triggering AGNs. This merger fraction in AGNs increases as stellar mass increases which supports
the idea that mergers are more important for triggering AGNs in more massive galaxies. In terms of
merger fraction as a function of AGN power we find a positive trend for MIR selected AGNs and a complex
trend for optically selected AGNs, which we interpret under an evolutionary scenario proposed
by previous studies. In addition, obscured MIR selected AGNs are more likely to be hosted in mergers
than unobscured MIR selected AGNs.
