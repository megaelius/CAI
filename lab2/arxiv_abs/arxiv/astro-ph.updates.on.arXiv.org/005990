We study the effects of the local environment on the molecular gas content of a large sample of log($M_{*}$/$M_{\odot}$)
$\gtrsim$ 10 star-forming and starburst galaxies with specific star-formation rates (sSFRs)
on and above the main-sequence (MS) to $z$ $\sim$ 3.5. ALMA observations of the dust continuum in
the COSMOS field are used to estimate molecular gas masses at $z$ $\approx$ 0.5-3.5. We also use a
local universe sample from the ALFALFA HI survey after converting it to molecular masses. The molecular
mass ($M_{ISM}$) scaling relation shows a dependence on $z$, $M_{*}$, and sSFR relative to the MS,
but no dependence on environmental overdensity $\Delta$ ($M_{ISM}$ $\propto$ $\Delta^{0.03}$).
Similarly, gas mass fraction (f$_{gas}$) and depletion timescale ($\tau$) show no environmental
dependence to $z$ $\sim$ 3.5. At $\langle z\rangle$ $\sim$ 1.8, the average $\langle M_{ISM}\rangle$,$\langle$f$_{gas}\rangle$,
and $\langle \tau \rangle$ in densest regions is (1.6$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^{11}$ $M_{\odot}$,
55$\pm$2%, and 0.8$\pm$0.1 Gyr, respectively, similar to those in the lowest density bin. Independent
of the environment, f$_{gas}$ decreases and $\tau$ increases with increasing cosmic time. Cosmic
molecular mass density ($\rho$) in the lowest density bins peaks at $z$ $\sim$ 1-2 and this peak happens
at $z$ $<$ 1 in densest bins. This differential evolution of $\rho$ across environments is likely
due to the growth of the large-scale structure with cosmic time. Our results suggest that the molecular
gas content and the subsequent star-formation activity of log($M_{*}$/$M_{\odot}$) $\gtrsim$
10 star-forming and starburst galaxies is primarily driven by internal processes, not their local
environment since $z$ $\sim$ 3.5
