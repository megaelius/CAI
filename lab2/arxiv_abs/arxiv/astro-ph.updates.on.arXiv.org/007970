Large scale astronomical surveys continue to increase their depth and scale, providing new opportunities
to observe large numbers of celestial objects with ever increasing precision. At the same time,
the sheer scale of ongoing and future surveys pose formidable challenges to classify astronomical
objects. Pioneering efforts on this front include the citizen science approach adopted by the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). These SDSS datasets have been used recently to train neural network models
to classify galaxies in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) that overlap the footprint of both surveys.
While this represents a significant step to classify unlabeled images of astrophysical objects
in DES, the key issue at heart still remains, i.e., the classification of unlabelled DES galaxies
that have not been observed in previous surveys. To start addressing this timely and pressing matter,
we demonstrate that knowledge from deep learning algorithms trained with real-object images can
be transferred to classify elliptical and spiral galaxies that overlap both SDSS and DES surveys,
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy 99.6%. More importantly, to initiate the characterization
of unlabelled DES galaxies that have not been observed in previous surveys, we demonstrate that
our neural network model can also be used for unsupervised clustering, grouping together unlabeled
DES galaxies into spiral and elliptical types. We showcase the application of this novel approach
by classifying over ten thousand unlabelled DES galaxies into spiral and elliptical classes. We
conclude by showing that unsupervised clustering can be combined with recursive training to start
creating large-scale DES galaxy catalogs in preparation for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
era.
