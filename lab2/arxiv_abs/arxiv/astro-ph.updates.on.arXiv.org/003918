Quasars are complex sources, characterized by broad band spectra from radio through optical to
X-ray band, with numerous emission and absorption features. However, Boroson & Green (1992) used
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and with this analysis they were able to show significant correlations
between the measured parameters. The leading component, related to Eigenvector 1 (EV1) was dominated
by the anticorrelation between the Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ optical emission and [OIII] line and EV1
alone contained 30% of the total variance. It opened a way in defining a quasar main sequence, in close
analogy to the stellar main sequence on the Hertzsprung-Russel (HR) diagram (Sulentic et al. 2001).
The question still remains which of the basic theoretically motivated parameters of an active nucleus
(Eddington ratio, black hole mass, accretion rate, spin, and viewing angle) is the main driver behind
the EV1. Here we limit ourselves to the optical waveband, and concentrate on theoretical modelling
the Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ to H$\mathrm{\beta}$ ratio, and we test the hypothesis that the physical
driver of EV1 is the maximum of the accretion disk temperature, reflected in the shape of the spectral
energy distribution (SED). We performed computations of the H$\mathrm{\beta}$ and optical Fe${\mathrm{II}}$
for a broad range of SED peak position using CLOUDY photoionisation code. We assumed that both H$\mathrm{\beta}$
and Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ emission come from the Broad Line Region represented as a constant density
cloud in a plane-parallel geometry. We expected that a hotter disk continuum will lead to more efficient
production of Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ but our computations show that the Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ to H$\mathrm{\beta}$
ratio actually drops with the rise of the disk temperature. Thus either hypothesis is incorrect,
or approximations used in our paper for the description of the line emissivity is inadequate.
