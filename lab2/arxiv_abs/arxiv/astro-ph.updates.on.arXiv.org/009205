Volatile organic molecules formed by photochemistry in the upper atmosphere of Titan can undergo
condensation as pure ices in the stratosphere and the troposphere as well as condense as ice layers
onto the organic aerosols that are visible as the haze layers of Titan. As solar photons penetrate
through Titan s atmosphere, shorter-wavelength photons are attenuated and longerwavelength
photons make it into the lower altitudes, where aerosols become abundant. We conducted an experimental
study to evaluate the long wavelength ( > 300 nm) photo-reactivity of these ices accreted on the Titan
aerosol-analogs (also known as tholins) made in the laboratory. We have focused on acetylene, the
third most abundant hydrocarbon in Titan s atmosphere after CH4 and C2H6. Further, acetylene is
the most abundant unsaturated hydrocarbon in Titan s atmosphere. Our results indicate that the
aerosols can act as activation centers to drive the photoreactivity of acetylene with the aerosols
at the accretion interface at wavelengths where acetylene-ice alone does not show photoreactivity.
We found that along with photochemistry, photodesorption plays an important role. We observed
that about 15% of the initial acetylene is photodesorbed, with a photodesorption rate of (2.1 +/-
0.2) x 10-6 molecules.photon-1 at 355 nm. This photodesorption is wavelength-dependent, confirming
that it is mediated by the UV absorption of the aerosol analogues, similar to photochemistry. We
conclude that the UV-Vis properties of aerosols would determine how they evolve further in Titan
s atmosphere and on the surface through photochemical alterations involving longer wavelength
photons.
