We present ALMA observations of the CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) molecular gas transitions and associated
(sub)-mm continua of the nearby Seyfert 1.5 galaxy NGC3227 with angular resolutions 0.085-0.21"
(7-15pc). On large scales the cold molecular gas shows circular motions as well as streaming motions
on scales of a few hundred parsecs associated with a large scale bar. We fitted the nuclear ALMA 1.3mm
emission with an unresolved component and an extended component. The 850$\mu$m emission shows
at least two extended components, one along the major axis of the nuclear disk and the other along
the axis of the ionization cone. The molecular gas in the central region (1" ~73pc) shows several
CO clumps with complex kinematics which appears to be dominated by non-circular motions. While
we cannot demonstrate conclusively the presence of a warped nuclear disk, we also detected non-circular
motions along the kinematic minor axis. They reach line-of-sight velocities of v-vsys =150-200km/s.
Assuming that the radial motions are in the plane of the galaxy, then we interpret them as a nuclear
molecular outflow due to molecular gas in the host galaxy being entrained by the AGN wind. We derive
molecular outflow rates of $5\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ and $0.6\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ at
projected distances of up to 30pc to the northeast and southwest of the AGN, respectively. At the
AGN location we estimate a mass in molecular gas of $5\times 10^{5}\,M_\odot$ and an average column
density $N({\rm H}_2) = 2-3\times 10^{23}\,{\rm cm}^{-2}$ in the inner 15pc. The nuclear molecular
gas and sub-mm continuum emission of NGC3227 do not resemble the classical compact torus. Rather,
these emissions extend for several tens of parsecs and appear connected with the circumnuclear
ring in the host galaxy disk, as found in other local AGN. (Abridged)
