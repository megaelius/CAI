We use the results of previous work building a halo model formalism for the distribution of neutral
hydrogen, along with experimental parameters of future radio facilities, to place forecasts on
astrophysical and cosmological parameters from next generation surveys. We consider 21 cm intensity
mapping surveys conducted using the BINGO, CHIME, FAST, TianLai, MeerKAT and SKA experimental
configurations. We work with the 5-parameter cosmological dataset of {$\Omega_m, \sigma_8, h,
n_s, \Omega_b$} assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and the astrophysical parameters {$v_{c,0},
\beta$} which represent the cutoff and slope of the HI- halo mass relation. We explore (i) quantifying
the effects of the astrophysics on the recovery of the cosmological parameters, (ii) the dependence
of the cosmological forecasts on the details of the astrophysical parametrization, and (iii) the
improvement of the constraints on probing smaller scales in the HI power spectrum. For an SKA I MID
intensity mapping survey alone, probing scales up to $\ell_{\rm max} = 1000$, we find a factor of
$1.1 - 1.3$ broadening in the constraints on $\Omega_b$ and $\Omega_m$, and of $2.4 - 2.6$ on $h$,
$n_s$ and $\sigma_8$, if we marginalize over astrophysical parameters without any priors. However,
even the prior information coming from the present knowledge of the astrophysics largely alleviates
this broadening. These findings do not change significantly on considering an extended HIHM relation,
illustrating the robustness of the results to the choice of the astrophysical parametrization.
Probing scales up to $\ell_{\rm max} = 2000$ improves the constraints by factors of 1.5-1.8. The
forecasts improve on increasing the number of tomographic redshift bins, saturating, in many cases,
with 4 - 5 redshift bins. We also forecast constraints for intensity mapping with other experiments,
and draw similar conclusions.
