We study how statistical properties of supermassive black holes depend on the frequency and conditions
for massive seed formation in cosmological simulations of structure formation. We develop a novel
method to re-calculate detailed growth histories and merger trees of black holes within the framework
of the Illustris simulation for several seed formation models, including a physically motivated
model where black hole seeds only form in progenitor galaxies that conform to the conditions for
direct collapse black hole formation. While all seed models considered here are in a broad agreement
with present observational constraints on black hole populations from optical, UV and X-ray studies,
we find they lead to widely different black hole number densities and halo occupation fractions
which are currently observationally unconstrained. In terms of future electromagnetic spectrum
observations, the faint-end quasar luminosity function and the low mass-end black hole-host galaxy
scaling relations are very sensitive to the specific massive seed prescription. Specifically,
the direct collapse model exhibits a seeding efficiency which decreases rapidly with cosmic time
and produces much fewer black holes in low mass galaxies, in contrast to the original Illustris simulation.
We further find that the total black hole merger rate varies by more than one order of magnitude for
different seed models, with the redshift evolution of the chirp mass changing as well. Supermassive
black hole merger detections with LISA and International Pulsar Timing Array may hence provide
the most direct means of constraining massive black hole seed formation in the early Universe.
