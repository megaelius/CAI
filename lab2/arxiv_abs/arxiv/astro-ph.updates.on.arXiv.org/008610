The census of stellar and substellar companions of nearby stars is largely incomplete. It is, however,
fundamentally important in the understanding of the stellar and planetary formation and evolution
mechanisms. We aim to characterize the presence of physical companions in orbit around nearby stars.
Orbiting secondary bodies influence the proper motion (PM) of their parent star through their gravitational
reflex motion. Using the Hipparcos catalog and Gaia's second data release (GDR2), we determined
the long-term PM of the stars common to these two catalogs. We then searched for a PM anomaly (PMa)
between the long-term PM vector and the GDR2 (or Hipparcos) measurements, indicative of the presence
of a perturbing secondary object. We focussed our analysis on the 6741 nearby stars located within
50 pc, and we also present a catalog of the PMa for >99% of the Hipparcos catalog (>117000 stars). 30%
of the stars studied present a PMa greater than 3 sigmas. The PMa allows us to detect orbiting companions,
or set stringent limits on their presence. We present a few applications to interesting targets.
We set upper limits of 0.1-0.3 M_Jup to potential planets orbiting Proxima between 1 and 10 au (P_orb=3
to 100 years). We confirm that Proxima is gravitationally bound to alpha Cen. We recover the masses
of the known companions of epsilon Eri, epsilon Ind, Ross 614 and beta Pic. We also detect a possible
planet of a few Jovian masses orbiting tau Ceti. The combination of the GDR2 with Hipparcos results
in very high accuracy PMa vectors. The detection of tangential velocity anomalies at a median accuracy
of sigma(Delta v_tan)=1.0 m/s per parsec of distance opens the possibility to identify long period
orbital companions otherwise inaccessible. Gaia's complementarity to radial velocity and transit
techniques already appears to be remarkably powerful.
