During the first three observing runs of the Advanced gravitational-wave detector network, the
LIGO/Virgo collaboration detected several black hole binary (BHBH) mergers. As the population
of detected BHBH mergers grows, it will become possible to constrain different channels for their
formation. Here we consider the chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) channel in close binaries,
by performing population synthesis simulations that combine realistic binary models with detailed
cosmological calculations of the chemical and star-formation history of the Universe. This allows
us to constrain population properties, as well as cosmological and aLIGO detection rates of BHBH
mergers formed through this pathway. We predict a BHBH merger rate at redshift zero of $5.8 \hspace{1mm}
\textrm{Gpc}^{-3} \textrm{yr}^{-1}$ through the CHE channel, to be compared with aLIGO's measured
rate of ${53.2}_{-28.2}^{+55.8} \hspace{1mm} \text{Gpc}^{-3}\text{yr}^{-1}$, and find that
eventual merger systems have BH masses in the range $17 - 43 \hspace{1mm} \textrm{M}_{\odot}$ below
the pair-instability supernova (PISN) gap, and $>124 \hspace{1mm} \textrm{M}_{\odot}$ above
the PISN gap. We further investigate the effects of momentum kicks during black hole formation,
calculate cosmological and magnitude limited PISN rates and investigate the effects of high-redshift
deviations in the star formation rate. We find that momentum kicks tend to increase delay times of
BHBH systems, and our magnitude limited PISN rate estimates indicate that current deep surveys
should be able to detect such events. Lastly, we find that our cosmological merger rate estimates
change by at most $\sim 8\%$ for mild deviations of the star formation rate in the early Universe,
and by up to $\sim 40\%$ for extreme deviations.
