We present CO observations of 78 spiral galaxies in local merger pairs. These galaxies representa
subsample of a Ks-band selected sample consisting of 88 close major-merger pairs (HKPAIRs), 44
spiral-spiral (S+S) pairs and 44 spiral-elliptical (S+E) pairs, with separation $<20 h^{-1}$
kpc and mass ratio <2.5. For all objects, the star formation rate (SFR) and dust mass were derived
from HERSCHEL PACS and SPIRE data, and the atomic gas mass, MHI, from the Green Bank Telescope HI observations.
The complete data set allows us to study the relation between the gas (atomic and molecular) mass,
dust mass and SFR in merger galaxies. We derive the molecular gas fraction (MH2/M*), molecular-to-atomic
gas mass ratio (MH2/MHI), gas-to-dust mass ratio and SFE (=SFR/MH2) and study their dependences
on pair type (S+S compared to S+E), stellar mass and the presence of morphological interaction signs.
We find an overall moderate enhancements (~2x) in both molecular gas fraction (MH2/M*), and molecular-to-atomic
gas ratio (MH2/MHI) for star-forming galaxies in major-merger pairs compared to non-interacting
comparison samples, whereas no enhancement was found for the SFE nor for the total gas mass fraction
(MHI+MH2)/M*. When divided into S+S and S+E, low mass and high mass, and with and without interaction
signs, there is a small difference in SFE, moderate difference in MH2/M*, and strong differences
in MH2/MHI between subsamples. For MH2/MHI, the difference between S+S and S+E subsamples is 0.69+-0.16
dex and between pairs with and without interaction signs is 0.53+-0.18 dex. Together, our results
suggest (1) star formation enhancement in close major-merger pairs occurs mainly in S+S pairs after
the first close encounter (indicated by interaction signs) because the HI gas is compressed into
star-forming molecular gas by the tidal torque; (2) this effect is much weakened in the S+E pairs.
