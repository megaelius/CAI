Low-frequency (80-240 MHz) radio observations of the solar corona are presented using the Murchison
Widefield Array (MWA), and several discoveries are reported. The corona is reviewed, followed
by chapters on Type III bursts and circularly-polarized quiescent emission. The second chapter
details new Type III burst dynamics. One source component at higher frequencies splits into two
at lower frequencies, where the two components rapidly diverge. This is attributed to electron
beams traversing a divergent magnetic field configuration, which is supported by extreme ultraviolet
jet observations outlining a coronal null point. The third chapter uses Type III burst heights as
density probes. Harmonic plasma emission implies ~4x enhancements over background models. This
can be explained by electron beams traveling along dense fibers or by propagation effects that elevate
apparent source heights. The quiescent corona is compared to model predictions to conclude that
propagation effects can largely but not entirely explain the apparent density enhancements. The
fourth chapter surveys over 100 spectropolarimetric observing runs. Around 700 compact sources
are detected with polarization fractions from less than 0.5% to nearly 100%. They are interpreted
as plasma emission noise storm sources down to levels not previously observable. A "bullseye" structure
is reported for coronal holes, where an outer ring surrounds an oppositely-polarized central component
that does not match the sign expected of thermal bremsstrahlung. The large-scale polarization
structure is shown to be well-correlated with that of a global magnetic field model. The last chapter
summarizes results and outlines future work. A preliminary comparison of polarization images
to model predictions is shared, along with coronal mass ejection observations revealing a radio
arc that is morphologically similar to the white-light structure.
