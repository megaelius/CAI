Supergranules are divergent 30-Mm sized cellular flows observed everywhere at the solar photosphere.
Their place in the hierarchy of convective structures and their origin remain poorly understood
(Rincon et al., 2018). Estimating supergranular depth is of particular interest since this may
help point to the underlying physics. However, their subsurface velocity profiles have proven
difficult to ascertain. Birch et al. (2006) had suggested that helioseismic inferences would benefit
from an ensemble average over multiple realizations of supergranules due to the reduction in realization
noise. Bhattacharya et al. (2017) used synthetic forward-modelled seismic wave travel times and
demonstrated the potential of helioseismic inversions at recovering the flow profile of an average
supergranule that is separable in the horizontal and vertical directions, although the premise
of this calculation has since been challenged by Ferret (2019). In this work we avoid this assumption
and carry out a validation test of helioseismic travel-time inversions starting from plausible
synthetic non-separable profiles of an average supergranule. We compute seismic wave travel times
and sensitivity kernels by simulating wave propagation through this background. We find that,
while the ability to recover the exact profile degrades based on the number of parameters involved,
we are nevertheless able to recover the peak depth of our models in a few iterations where the measurements
are presumably above the noise cutoff. This represents an important step towards unraveling the
physics behind supergranules, as we start appreciating the parameters that we may reliably infer
from a time-distance helioseismic inversion.
