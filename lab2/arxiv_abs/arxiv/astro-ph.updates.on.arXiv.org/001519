In this review we focus on the role jets and outflows play in the star and planet formation process.
Our essential question can be posed as follows: are jets/outflows merely an epiphenomenon associated
with star formation or do they play an important role in mediating the physics of assembling stars
both individually and globally? We address this question by reviewing the current state of observations
and their key points of contact with theory. Our review of jet/outflow phenomena is organized into
three length-scale domains: Source and Disk Scales ($0.1-10^2$ au) where the connection with protostellar
and disk evolution theories is paramount; Envelope Scales ($10^2-10^5$ au) where the chemistry
and propagation shed further light on the jet launching process, its variability and its impact
on the infalling envelope; Parent Cloud Scales ($10^5-10^6$ au) where global momentum injection
into cluster/cloud environments become relevant. Issues of feedback are of particular importance
on the smallest scales where planet formation regions in a disk may be impacted by the presence of
disk winds, irradiation by jet shocks or shielding by the winds. Feedback on envelope scales may
determine the final stellar mass (core-to-star efficiency) and envelope dissipation. Feedback
also plays an important role on the larger scales with outflows contributing to turbulent support
within clusters including alteration of cluster star formation efficiencies (feedback on larger
scales currently appears unlikely). A particularly novel dimension of our review is that we consider
results on jet dynamics from the emerging field of High Energy Density Laboratory Astrophysics
(HEDLA). HEDLA is now providing direct insights into the 3-D dynamics of fully magnetized, hypersonic,
radiative outflows.
