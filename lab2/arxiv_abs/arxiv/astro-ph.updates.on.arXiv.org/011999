Highly porous small bodies are thought to have been ubiquitous in the early solar system. Therefore,
it is essential to understand the collision process of highly porous objects when considering the
collisional evolution of primitive small bodies in the solar system. To date, impact disruption
experiments have been conducted using high-porosity targets made of ice, pumice, and glass, and
numerical simulations of impact fracture of porous bodies have also been conducted. However, a
variety of internal structures of high-porosity bodies are possible. Therefore,laboratory experiments
and numerical simulations in the wide parameter space are necessary. In this study, high-porosity
targets of sintered hollow glass beads and targets made by mixing perlite with hollow beads were
used in a collision disruption experiment to investigate the effects of the mixture on collisional
destruction of high-porosity bodies. Among the targets prepared under the same sintering conditions,
it was found that the targets with more impurities tend to have lower compressive strength and lower
resistance against impact disruption. Further, destruction of the mixture targets required more
impact energy density than would have been expected from compressive strength. It is likely that
the perlite grains in the target matrix inhibit crack growth through the glass framework. The mass
fraction of the largest fragment collapsed to a single function of a scaling parameter of energy
density in the strength regime ({\Pi}_s) when assuming ratios of tensile strength to compressive
strength based on a relationship obtained for ice-silicate mixtures.
