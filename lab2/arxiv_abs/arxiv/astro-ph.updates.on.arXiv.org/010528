In the framework of the GAPS project, we observed the planet-hosting star KELT-9 (A-type star, VsinI$\sim$110
km/s) with the HARPS-N spectrograph at the TNG. In this work we analyse the spectra and the extracted
radial velocities (RVs), to constrain the physical parameters of the system and to detect the planetary
atmosphere of KELT-9b. We extracted from the high-resolution optical spectra the mean stellar
line profiles with an analysis based on the Least Square Deconvolution technique. Then, we computed
the stellar RVs with a method optimized for fast rotators, by fitting the mean stellar line profile
with a purely rotational profile instead of using a Gaussian function. The new spectra and analysis
led us to update the orbital and physical parameters of the system, improving in particular the value
of the planetary mass to $M_{\rm p}=2.88\pm0.35\,M_{\rm Jup}$. We discovered an anomalous in-transit
RV deviation from the theoretical Rossiter-McLaughlin effect solution, calculated from the projected
spin-orbit angle $\lambda=-85.78\pm0.46$ degrees measured with Doppler tomography. We prove
that this deviation is caused by the planetary atmosphere of KELT-9b, thus we name this effect Atmospheric
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. By analysing the magnitude of the RV anomaly, we obtained information
on the extension of the planetary atmosphere as weighted by the model used to retrieve the stellar
mean line profiles, which is up to $1.22\pm0.02\,R_{\rm p}$. The Atmospheric Rossiter-McLaughlin
effect will be observable for other exoplanets whose atmosphere has non-negligible correlation
with the stellar mask used to retrieve the RVs, in particular ultra-hot Jupiters with iron in their
atmosphere. The duration and amplitude of the effect will depend not only on the extension of the
atmosphere, but also on the in-transit planetary RVs and on the projected rotational velocity of
the parent star.
