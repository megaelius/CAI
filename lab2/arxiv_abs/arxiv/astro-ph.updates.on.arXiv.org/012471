We study the impact of gas accretion on the orbital evolution of black-hole binaries initially at
large separation in the band of the planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We focus
on two sources: (i)~stellar-origin black-hole binaries~(SOBHBs) that can migrate from the LISA
band to the band of ground-based gravitational-wave observatories within weeks/months; and (ii)
intermediate-mass black-hole binaries~(IMBHBs) in the LISA band only. Because of the large number
of observable gravitational-wave cycles, the phase evolution of these systems needs to be modeled
to great accuracy to avoid biasing the estimation of the source parameters. Accretion affects the
gravitational-wave phase at negative ($-4$) post-Newtonian order, and is therefore dominant
for binaries at large separations. If accretion takes place at the Eddington or at super-Eddington
rate, it will leave a detectable imprint on the dynamics of SOBHBs. In optimistic astrophysical
scenarios, a multiwavelength strategy with LISA and a ground-based interferometer can detect
about $10$ (a few) SOBHB events for which the accretion rate can be measured at $50\%$ ($10\%$) level.
In all cases the sky position can be identified within much less than $0.4\,{\rm deg}^2$ uncertainty.
Likewise, accretion at $\gtrsim 10\%$ ($\gtrsim 100\%$) of the Eddington rate can be measured in
IMBHBs up to redshift $z\approx 0.1$ ($z\approx 0.5$), and the position of these sources can be identified
within less than $0.01\,{\rm deg}^2$ uncertainty. Altogether, a detection of SOBHBs or IMBHBs
would allow for targeted searches of electromagnetic counterparts to black-hole mergers in gas-rich
environments with future X-ray detectors (such as Athena) and radio observatories (such as SKA).
