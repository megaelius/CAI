The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec instrument will allow rest-frame ultraviolet/optical
spectroscopy of galaxies in the epoch of reionization (EoR). Some galaxies may exhibit significant
leakage of hydrogen-ionizing photons into the intergalactic medium, resulting in faint nebular
emission lines. We present a machine learning framework for identifying cases of very high hydrogen-ionizing
photon escape from galaxies based on the data quality expected from potential NIRSpec observations
of EoR galaxies in lensed fields. We train our algorithm on mock samples of JWST/NIRSpec data for
galaxies at redshifts $z=6$--10. To make the samples more realistic, we combine synthetic galaxy
spectra based on cosmological galaxy simulations with observational noise relevant for $z\gtrsim
6$ objects of a brightness similar to EoR galaxy candidates uncovered in Frontier Fields observations
of galaxy cluster Abell-2744 and MACS-J0416. We find that ionizing escape fractions ($f_\mathrm{esc}$)
of galaxies brighter than $m_\mathrm{AB,1500} \approx 27$ mag may be retrieved with mean absolute
error $\Delta f_\mathrm{esc}\approx$0.09(0.12) for 24h (1.5h) JWST/NIRSpec exposures at resolution
R=100. For 24h exposure time, even fainter galaxies ($m_\mathrm{AB,1500} < 28.5$ mag) can be processed
with $\Delta f_\mathrm{esc}\approx$0.14. This framework simultaneously estimates the redshift
of these galaxies with a relative error less than 0.03 for both 24h ($m_\mathrm{AB,1500} < 28.5$
mag) and 1.5h ($m_\mathrm{AB,1500} < 27$ mag) exposure times. We also consider scenarios where
just a minor fraction of galaxies attain high $f_\mathrm{esc}$ and present the conditions required
for detecting a subpopulation of high $f_\mathrm{esc}$ galaxies within the dataset.
