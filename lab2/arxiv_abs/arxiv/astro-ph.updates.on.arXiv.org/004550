Recently, the LIGO-Virgo collaboration discovered gravitational waves and in their first publication
on the subject the authors also presented a graviton mass constraint as $m_g < 1.2 \times 10^{-22}$
eV Abbott et al. (2016). In the paper we analyze a potential to reduce upper bounds for graviton mass
with future observational data on trajectories of bright stars near the Galactic Center.Since
gravitational potentials are different for these two cases, expressions for relativistic advance
for general relativity and Yukawa potential are different functions on eccentricity and semimajor
axis, it gives an opportunity to improve current estimates of graviton mass with future observational
facilities. In our considerations of an improvement potential for a graviton mass estimate we adopt
a conservative strategy and assume trajectories of bright stars and their apocenter advance will
be described with general relativity expressions and it gives opportunities to improve graviton
mass constraints. In contrast with our previous studies, where we present current constraints
on parameters of Yukawa gravity (Borka et al., 2013) and graviton mass (Zakharov et al. 2016) from
observations of S2 star, in the paper we express expectations to improve current constraints for
graviton mass, assuming the GR predictions about apocenter shifts will be confirmed with future
observations. We concluded that if future observations of bright star orbits during around fifty
years will confirm GR predictions about apocenter shifts of bright star orbits it give an opportunity
to constrain a graviton mass at a level around $5 \times 10^{-23}$ eV or slightly better than current
estimates obtained with LIGO observations.
