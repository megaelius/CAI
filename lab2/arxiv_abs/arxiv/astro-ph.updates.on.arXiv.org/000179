We present a detailed theoretical analysis of the gravitational-wave (GW) signal of the post-bounce
evolution of core-collapse supernovae (SNe), employing for the first time relativistic, two-dimensional
(2D) explosion models with multi-group, three-flavor neutrino transport based on the ray-by-ray-plus
approximation. The waveforms reflect the accelerated mass motions associated with the characteristic
evolutionary stages that were also identified in previous works: A quasi-periodic modulation
by prompt postshock convection is followed by a phase of relative quiescence before growing amplitudes
signal violent hydrodynamical activity due to convection and the standing accretion shock instability
during the accretion period of the stalled shock. Finally, a high-frequency, low-amplitude variation
from proto-neutron star (PNS) convection below the neutrinosphere appears superimposed on the
low-frequency trend associated with the aspherical expansion of the SN shock after the onset of
the explosion. Relativistic effects in combination with detailed neutrino transport are shown
to be essential for quantitative predictions of the GW frequency evolution and energy spectrum,
because they determine the structure of the PNS surface layer and its characteristic g-mode frequency.
Burst-like high-frequency activity phases, correlated with sudden luminosity increase and spectral
hardening of electron (anti-)neutrino emission for some 10ms, are discovered as new features after
the onset of the explosion. They correspond to intermittent episodes of anisotropic accretion
by the PNS in the case of fallback SNe. We find stronger signals for more massive progenitors with
large accretion rates. The typical frequencies are higher for massive PNSs, though the time-integrated
spectrum also strongly depends on the model dynamics.
