We present Nobeyama 45m telescope C18O, 13CO, and 12CO(1-0) mapping observations towards an interstellar
filament in the Taurus molecular cloud. We investigate the gas velocity structure along the filament
and in its surrounding parent cloud. The filament is detected in the optically thin C18O emission
as a single velocity component, ~1pc long, ~0.06pc wide structure. The C18O emission traces dust
column densities larger than ~5x10^21 cm-2. The line-of-sight (LOS) velocity fluctuates along
the filament crest with an average amplitude of ~0.2 km/s. The 13CO and 12CO integrated intensity
maps show spatially extended emission around the elongated filament. We identify three extended
structures with LOS velocities redshifted and blueshifted with respect to the average velocity
of the filament identified in C18O. Based on combined analyses of velocity integrated channel maps
and intensity variations of the optically thick 12CO spectra on and off the filament, we propose
a 3-dimensional structure of the cloud surrounding the filament. We further suggest a multi-interaction
scenario where sheet-like extended structures interact, in space and time, with the filament and
are responsible for its compression and/or disruption, playing an important role in the star formation
history of the filament. We also identify, towards the same field, a very faint filament showing
a velocity field compatible with the filament formation process proposed by Inoue et al. (2017),
where a filament is formed due to convergence of a flow of matter generated by the bending of the ambient
magnetic field structure induced by an interstellar shock compression.
