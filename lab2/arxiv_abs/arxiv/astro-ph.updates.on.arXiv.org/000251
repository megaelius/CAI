We produce an atlas of homogeneously reduced and calibrated low resolution IRS spectra of the nuclear
regions of nearby early-type galaxies (i.e. Es and S0s, ETGs), in order to build a reference sample
in the mid-infrared window. From the Spitzer Heritage Archive we extract ETGs in the "Revised Shapley-Ames
Catalog of Bright Galaxies" having an IRS SL and/or LL spectrum. We recover 91 spectra out of 363 galaxies
classified as ETGs in the catalog: 56 E (E0-E6), 8 mixed E/S0+S0/E, 27 S0 (both normal and barred -
SB0) plus mixed types SB0/Sa+SB0/SBa. For each galaxy, we provide the fully reduced and calibrated
spectrum, the intensity of nebular and molecular emission lines as well as of the Polycyclic Aromatic
Hydrocarbons (PAHs) after a template spectrum of a passively evolving ETG has been subtracted.
Spectra are classified into five mid-infrared classes, ranging from AGN (class-4) and star forming
nuclei (class-3), transition class-2 (with PAHs) and class-1 (no-PAHs) to passively evolving
nuclei (class-0). A demographic study of mid-infrared spectra shows that Es are significantly
more passive than S0s: 46^{+11}_{-10}% of Es and 20^{+11}_{-7}% of S0s have a spectrum of class-0.
Emission lines are revealed in 64^{+12}_{-6}% of ETGs. The H_2-S(1) line is found with similar rate
in Es (34^{+10}_{-8}%) and in S0s (51^{+15}_{-12}%). PAHs are detected in 47^{+8}_{-7}% of ETGs,
but only 9^{+4}_{-3}% have PAHs ratios typical of star forming galaxies. Several indicators, such
as peculiar morphologies and kinematics, dust--lane irregular shape, radio and X-ray properties,
suggest that mid-infrared spectral classes are connected to phases of accretion/feedback phenomena
occurring in the nuclei of ETGs.
