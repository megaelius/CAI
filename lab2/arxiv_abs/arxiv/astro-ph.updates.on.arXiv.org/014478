M51 and NGC 5195 is an interacting system that can be explored in great details with ground-based
telescopes. The H II regions in M51 were observed using the 2.16 m telescope of the National Astronomical
Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the 6.5 m Multiple Mirror Telescope with spatial
resolution of less than $\sim100$ pc. We obtain a total of 113 spectra across the galaxy and combine
the literature data of Croxall et al. to derive a series of physical properties, including the gas-phase
extinction, stellar population age, star formation rate (SFR) surface density, and oxygen abundance.
The spatial distributions and radial profiles of these properties are investigated in order to
study the characteristics of M51 and the clues to the formation and evolution of this galaxy. M51
presents a mild radial extinction gradient. The lower gas-phase extinction in the north spiral
arms compared to the south arms are possibly caused by the past encounters with the companion galaxy
of NGC 5195. A number of H II regions have the stellar age between 50 and 500 Myr, consistent with the
recent interaction history by simulations in the literatures. The SFR surface density presents
a mild radial gradient, which is ubiquitous in spiral galaxies. There is a negative metallicity
gradient of $-0.08$ dex $R_{e}^{-1}$ in the disk region, which is also commonly found in many spiral
galaxies. It is supported by the "inside-out" scenario of galaxy formation. We find a positive abundance
gradient of 0.26 dex $R_{e}^{-1}$ in the inner region. There are possible reasons causing the positive
gradient, including the freezing of the chemical enrichment due to the star-forming quenching
in the bulge and the gas infall and dilution due to the pseudobulge growth and/or galactic interaction.
