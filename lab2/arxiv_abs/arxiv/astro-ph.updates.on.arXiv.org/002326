We use the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) 21cm survey to measure the number density of galaxies
as a function of their rotational velocity, Vrot,HI (as inferred from the width of their 21cm emission
line). Based on the measured velocity function we statistically connect galaxies with their host
halos, via abundance matching. In a LCDM cosmology, dwarf galaxies are expected to be hosted by halos
that are significantly more massive than indicated by the measured galactic velocity; if smaller
halos were allowed to host galaxies, then ALFALFA should be measuring a much larger galactic number
density. We then seek observational verification of this predicted trend, by analyzing the kinematics
of a literature sample of gas-rich dwarf galaxies. We find that galaxies with Vrot,HI<25 km/s
are kinematically incompatible with their predicted LCDM host halos, in the sense that hosts are
too massive to be accommodated within the measured galactic rotation curves. This issue is analogous
to the "too big to fail" problem faced by the bright satellites of the Milky Way, but here it concerns
extreme dwarf galaxies in the field. Consequently, solutions based on satellite-specific processes
are not applicable in this context. Our result confirms the findings of previous studies based on
optical survey data, and addresses a number of observational systematics present in these works.
Furthermore, we point out the assumptions and uncertainties that could strongly affect our conclusions.
We show that the two most important among them -namely baryonic effects on the abundances of halos
and on the rotation curves of halos- do not seem capable of resolving the reported discrepancy (at
least when considered individually).
