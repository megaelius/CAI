UX Orionis stars (UXors) are Herbig Ae/Be or T Tauri stars exhibiting sporadic occultation of stellar
light by circumstellar dust. GM\,Cephei is such a UXor in the young ($\sim4$~Myr) open cluster Trumpler\,37,
showing prominent infrared excess, emission-line spectra, and flare activity. Our photometric
monitoring (2008--2018) detects (1)~an $\sim$3.43~day period, likely arising from rotational
modulation by surface starspots, (2)~sporadic brightening on time scales of days due to accretion,
(3)~irregular minor flux drops due to circumstellar dust extinction, and (4)~major flux drops,
each lasting for a couple of months with a recurrence time, though not exactly periodic, of about
two years. The star experiences normal reddening by large grains, i.e., redder when dimmer, but
exhibits an unusual "blueing" phenomenon in that the star turns blue near brightness minima. The
maximum extinction during relatively short (lasting $\leq 50$~days) events, is proportional
to the duration, a consequence of varying clump sizes. For longer events, the extinction is independent
of duration, suggestive of a transverse string distribution of clumps. Polarization monitoring
indicates an optical polarization varying $\sim3\%$--8$\%$, with the level anticorrelated with
the slow brightness change. Temporal variation of the unpolarized and polarized light sets constraints
on the size and orbital distance of the circumstellar clumps in the interplay with the young star
and scattering envelope. These transiting clumps are edge-on manifestations of the ring- or spiral-like
structures found recently in young stars with imaging in infrared of scattered light, or in submillimeter
of thermalized dust emission.
