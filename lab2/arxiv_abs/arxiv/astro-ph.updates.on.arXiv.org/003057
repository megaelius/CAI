The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will provide high precision time-series photometry
for millions of stars with at least a half-hour cadence. Of particular interest are the circular
regions of 12-degree radius centered around the ecliptic poles that will be observed continuously
for a full year. Spectroscopic stellar parameters are desirable to characterize and select suitable
targets for TESS, whether they are focused on exploring exoplanets, stellar astrophysics, or Galactic
archaeology. Here, we present spectroscopic stellar parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H],
$v \sin i$, $v_{\rm micro}$) for about 16,000 dwarf and subgiant stars in TESS' southern continuous
viewing zone. For almost all the stars, we also present Bayesian estimates of stellar properties
including distance, extinction, mass, radius, and age using theoretical isochrones. Stellar
surface gravity and radius are made available for an additional set of roughly 8,500 red giants.
All our target stars are in the range $10<V<13.1$. Among them, we identify and list 227 stars belonging
to the Large Magellanic Cloud. The data were taken using the the High Efficiency and Resolution Multi-Element
Spectrograph (HERMES, R $\sim 28,000$) at the Anglo-Australian Telescope as part of the TESS-HERMES
survey. Comparing our results with the TESS Input Catalog (TIC) shows that the TIC is generally efficient
in separating dwarfs and giants, but it has flagged more than hundred cool dwarfs ($T_{\rm eff}<
4800$ K) as giants, which ought to be high-priority targets for the exoplanet search. The catalog
