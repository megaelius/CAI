Transiting hot Jupiters occupy a wedge-shaped region in the mass ratio-orbital separation diagram.
Its upper boundary is eroded by tidal spiral-in of massive, close-in planets and is sensitive to
the stellar tidal dissipation parameter $Q_s'$. We develop a simple generative model of the orbital
separation distribution of the known population of transiting hot Jupiters, subject to tidal orbital
decay, XUV-driven evaporation and observational selection bias. From the joint likelihood of
the observed orbital separations of hot Jupiters discovered in ground-based wide-field transit
surveys, measured with respect to the hyperparameters of the underlying population model, we recover
narrow posterior probability distributions for $Q_s'$ in two different tidal forcing frequency
regimes. We validate the method using mock samples of transiting planets with known tidal parameters.
We find that $Q_s'$ and its temperature dependence are retrieved reliably over five orders of magnitude
in $Q_s'$. A large sample of hot Jupiters from small-aperture ground-based surveys yields $\log_{10}
Q_s'=(8.26\pm 0.14)$ for 223 systems in the equilibrium-tide regime. We detect no significant
dependence of $Q_s'$ on stellar effective temperature. A further 19 systems in the dynamical-tide
regime yield $\log_{10} Q_s'=7.3\pm 0.4$, indicating stronger coupling. Detection probabilities
for transiting planets at a given orbital separation scale inversely with the increase in their
tidal migration rates since birth. The resulting bias towards younger systems explains why the
surface gravities of hot Jupiters correlate with their host stars' chromospheric emission fluxes.
We predict departures from a linear transit-timing ephemeris of less than 4 seconds for WASP-18
over a 20-year baseline.
