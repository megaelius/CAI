We perform two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations of accretion flows onto black
holes (BHs) at the nuclei of protogalaxies, and study the impact of mechanical and radiative feedback
on rapid growth of BHs. The outflows deposit mass, momentum and energy into the surrounding medium
and prevent mass accretion onto the BH, resulting in the reduction of radiative output. We find that
when the BH is embedded in a dense gas core, ionizing radiation attenuated by inefficient BH feeding
owing to mechanical feedback hardly affects the gas dynamics at the BH gravitational sphere of influence,
from which intense inflows of neutral gas occur at rates substantially exceeding the Eddington
limit without impeded by photoionization and heating. Since mechanical power of outflows driven
by the rapidly accreting BH is sufficiently strong, bipolar outflows completely evacuate the surrounding
gas in the polar region but mass inflows through the equatorial region maintain the BH accretion
rate as high as $\sim 300-10^3~\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$, which is reduced by one order of magnitude from
those with radiative feedback alone. Furthermore, we find that the critical gas density required
for rapid accretion is lower by a factor of $\sim 3$ nearly independently of BH mass, when mechanical
feedback is considered. By studying the dependence on outflow model parameters (e.g., opening
angle, mass-loading degree into outflows, velocity), we conclude that contrary to naive expectation,
the existence of stronger outflow leads to the transition to rapid accretion phases more efficiently.
Rapidly growing BHs inject mechanical power with $\sim 0.1-1\%$ of the radiative luminosity into
their host galaxy scales, which is used for cosmological simulations.
