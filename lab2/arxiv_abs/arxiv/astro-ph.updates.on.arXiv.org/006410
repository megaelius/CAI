Stars between two and three solar masses rotate rapidly on the main sequence, and their rotation
rates in the core helium burning (secondary clump) phase can therefore be used to test models of angular
momentum loss used for gyrochronology in a new regime. Because both their core and surface rotation
rates can be measured, these stars can also be used to set strong constraints on angular momentum
transport inside stars. We find that they are rotating slower than angular momentum conservation
and rigid rotation would predict. Our results are insensitive to the degree of core-envelope coupling
because of the small moment of inertia of the radiative core. We discuss two possible mechanisms
for slowing down the surfaces of these stars: (1) substantial angular momentum loss, and (2) radial
differential rotation in the surface convection zone. Modern angular momentum loss prescriptions
used for solar-type stars predict secondary clump surface rotation rates in much better agreement
with the data than prior variants used in the literature, and we argue that such enhanced loss is required
to understand the combination of core and surface rotation rates. However, we find that the assumed
radial differential rotation profile in convective regions has a strong impact on the predicted
surface rotation rates, and that a combination of enhanced loss and radial differential rotation
in the surface convection zone is also consistent with the data. We discuss future tests that can
quantify the impact of both phenomena. Current data tentatively suggests that some combination
of the two processes fits the data better than either one alone.
