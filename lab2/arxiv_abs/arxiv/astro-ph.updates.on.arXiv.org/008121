This is the second paper of a series making use of Herschel/PACS spectroscopy of evolved stars in
the THROES catalogue to study the inner regions of their circumstellar envelopes (CSEs). We analyze
the CO emission spectra, including a large number of high-$J$ CO lines (from $J$=14-13 to $J$=45-44),
as a proxy for the warm molecular gas in the CSEs of a sample of bright carbon-rich stars spanning different
evolutionary stages from the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) to the young planetary nebulae (PNe)
phase. We use the rotational diagram (RD) to derive rotational temperatures ($T_{\rm rot}$) and
masses ($M_{\rm H_2}$) of the envelope layers where the CO transitions arise. We also obtain a first
order estimate of the mass-loss rates and assess the impact of the opacity correction for a range
of characteristic envelope radii. We use multi-epoch spectra for the well studied C-rich envelope
IRC+10216 to investigate the impact of CO flux variability on the values of $T_{\rm rot}$ and $M_{\rm
H_2}$. PACS sensitivity allowed the study of higher rotational numbers than before, indicating
the presence of a significant amount of warmer gas ($\sim$200-900 K) not traceable with lower-$J$
CO observations at sub-mm/mm wavelengths. The masses are in the range $\sim10^{-2}-10^{-5}\,\rm
M_{\odot}$, anti-correlated with temperature. For some strong CO emitters we infer a double temperature
(warm $T_{\rm rot}\sim$400 K and hot $T_{\rm rot}\sim$820 K) component. From the analysis of IRC+10216,
we corroborate that the effect of line variability is perceptible on the $T_{\rm rot}$ of the hot
component only, and certainly insignificant on $M_{\rm H_2}$ and, hence, the mass-loss rate. Therefore,
the parameters derived from the RD are robust even when strong line flux variability occurs, with
the major source of uncertainty in the estimate of the mass-loss rate being the size of the CO-emitting
volume.
