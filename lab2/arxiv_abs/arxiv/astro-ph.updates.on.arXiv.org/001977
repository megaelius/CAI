We present ALMA observations of the [CII] line and far-infrared (FIR) continuum of a normally star-forming
galaxy in the reionization epoch, the z=6.96 Ly-alpha emitter (LAE) IOK-1. Probing to sensitivities
of sigma_line = 240 micro-Jy/beam (40 km/s channel) and sigma_cont = 21 micro-Jy/beam, we found
the galaxy undetected in both [CII] and continuum. Comparison of UV - FIR spectral energy distribution
(SED) of IOK-1, including our ALMA limit, with those of several types of local galaxies (including
the effects of the cosmic microwave background, CMB, on the FIR continuum) suggests that IOK-1 is
similar to local dwarf/irregular galaxies in SED shape rather than highly dusty/obscured galaxies.
Moreover, our 3 sigma FIR continuum limit, corrected for CMB effects, implies intrinsic dust mass
M_dust < 6.4 x 10^7 M_sun, FIR luminosity L_FIR < 3.7 x 10^{10} L_sun (42.5 - 122.5 micron),
total IR luminosity L_IR < 5.7 x 10^{10} L_sun (8 - 1000 micron) and dust-obscured star formation
rate (SFR) < 10 M_sun/yr, if we assume that IOK-1 has a dust temperature and emissivity index typical
of local dwarf galaxies. This SFR is 2.4 times lower than one estimated from the UV continuum, suggesting
that < 29% of the star formation is obscured by dust. Meanwhile, our 3 sigma [CII] flux limit translates
into [CII] luminosity, L_[CII] < 3.4 x 10^7 L_sun. Locations of IOK-1 and previously observed
LAEs on the L_[CII] vs. SFR and L_[CII]/L_FIR vs. L_FIR diagrams imply that LAEs in the reionization
epoch have significantly lower gas and dust enrichment than AGN-powered systems and starbursts
at similar/lower redshifts, as well as local star-forming galaxies.
