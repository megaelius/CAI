Line intensity mapping (LIM) is a promising tool to efficiently probe the three-dimensional large-scale
structure by mapping the aggregate emission of a spectral line from all sources that trace the matter
density field. Spectral lines from different redshifts can fall in the same observed frequency
and be confused, however, which is a major challenge in LIM. In this work, we develop a line de-confusion
technique in map space capable of reconstructing the three-dimensional spatial distribution
of line-emitting sources. If multiple spectral lines of a source population are observable in multiple
frequencies, using the sparse approximation our technique iteratively extracts sources along
a given line-of-sight by fitting the LIM data to a set of spectral templates. We demonstrate that
the technique successfully extracts sources with emission lines present at a few sigma above the
noise level, taking into account uncertainties in the source modeling and presence of continuum
foreground contamination and noise fluctuations. As an example, we consider a TIME/CONCERTO-like
survey targeting [C II] at the Epoch of Reionization, and reliably reconstruct the 3D spatial distribution
of the CO interlopers at $0.5\lesssim z\lesssim 1.5$. We also demonstrate a successful de-confusion
for the SPHEREx mission in the near-infrared wavelengths. Potentially, the reconstructed maps
can be further cross-correlated with a (galaxy) tracer population to estimate the total interloper
power in the linear clustering regime. This technique is a general framework to extract the phase-space
distribution of low-redshift interlopers, without the need of external information, for any line
de-confusion problem.
