Weak gravitational lensing of the 21 cm radiation is expected to be an important cosmological probe
for post-reionization physics. We investigate the reconstruction of the matter density perturbations
using a quadratic minimum variance estimator. The next generation of line intensity mapping (LIM)
surveys such as HIRAX and CHIME will cover a larger sky fraction, which requires one to account for
the curvature in the sky. Thus, we extend the plane-parallel flat-sky formalism for lensing reconstruction
to account for a full-sky survey using the Spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) expansion. Using the
HIRAX 21 cm survey as a basis, we make predictions for lensing-reconstruction noise in our formalism
and compare our results with the predictions from the plane-parallel formalism. We find agreement
with the plane-parallel noise power spectrum at small scales and a significant deviation at scales
$L\lesssim \ell_{\rm res}-k_{\rm eq}R$ where $R$ is the radius of the shell volume, $k_{\rm eq}$
is the wavenumber for matter-radiation equality, and $\ell_{\rm res}$ is the angular resolution
scale. Furthermore, we derive the SFB flat-sky reconstruction noise and compare it with the full-sky
SFB case as well as the plane-parallel case, finding minor deviations from the full-sky noise due
to sphericity. We also determine that, in the absence of non-Gaussian statistics of the intensity
field but accounting for foregrounds, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for $C_\ell^{\phi\phi}$
using our SFB estimator increases by 107%. This shows that accounting for the curved sky in LIM weak
lensing will be crucial for large-scale cosmology.
