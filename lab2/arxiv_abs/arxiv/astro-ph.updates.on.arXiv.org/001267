We have evaluated the diffuse intracluster light (ICL) in the central core of the galaxy cluster
CL0024+17 at $z\sim 0.4$ observed with the prime focus camera (LBC) at LBT. The measure required
an accurate removal of the galaxies light within $\sim 200$ kpc from the center. The residual background
intensity has then been integrated in circular apertures to derive the average ICL intensity profile.
The latter shows an approximate exponential decline as expected from theoretical cold dark matter
models. The radial profile of the ICL over the galaxies intensity ratio (ICL fraction) is increasing
with decreasing radius but near the cluster center it starts to bend and then decreases where the
overlap of the halos of the brightest cluster galaxies becomes dominant. Theoretical expectations
in a simplified CDM scenario show that the ICL fraction profile can be estimated from the stripped
over galaxy stellar mass ratio in the cluster. It is possible to show that the latter quantity is almost
independent of the properties of the individual host galaxies but mainly depends on the average
cluster properties. The predicted ICL fraction profile is thus very sensitive to the assumed CDM
profile, total mass and concentration parameter of the cluster. Adopting values very similar to
those derived from the most recent lensing analysis in CL0024+17 we find a good agreement with the
observed ICL fraction profile. The galaxy counts in the cluster core have then been compared with
that derived from composite cluster samples in larger volumes, up to the clusters virial radius.
The galaxy counts in the CL0024+17 core appear flatter and the amount of bending respect to the average
cluster galaxy counts imply a loss of total emissivity in broad agreement with the measured ICL fraction.
