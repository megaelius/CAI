(Abridged) We present an investigation of kinematical imprints of AGN feedback on the Warm Ionized
gas Medium (WIM) of massive early-type galaxies (ETGs). To this end, we take a two-fold approach
that involves a comparative analysis of Halpha velocity fields in 123 local ETGs from the CALIFA
integral field spectroscopy survey with 20 simulated galaxies from high-resolution hydrodynamic
cosmological SPHgal simulations. The latter were re-simulated for two modeling setups, one with
and another without AGN feedback. In order to quantify the effects of AGN feedback on gas kinematics
we measure three parameters that probe deviations from simple regular rotation using the kinemetry
package. These indicators trace the possible presence of distinct kinematic components in Fourier
space (k3,5/k1), variations in the radial profile of the kinematic major axis (sigma_PA), and offsets
between the stellar and gas velocity fields (Delta Phi). These quantities are monitored in the simulations
from a redshift 3 to 0.2 to assess the connection between black hole accretion history, stellar mass
growth and kinematical perturbation of the WIM. Observed local massive galaxies show a broad range
of irregularities, indicating disturbed warm gas motions, irrespective of being classified via
diagnostic lines as AGN or not. Simulations of massive galaxies with AGN feedback generally exhibit
higher irregularity parameters than without AGN feedback, more consistent with observations.
Besides AGN feedback, other processes like major merger events or infalling gas clouds can lead
to elevated irregularity parameters, but they are typically of shorter duration. More specifically,
k3,5/k1 is most sensitive to AGN feedback, whereas Delta Phi is most strongly affected by gas infall.
