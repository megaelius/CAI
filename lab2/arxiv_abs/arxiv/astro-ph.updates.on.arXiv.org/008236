We present the results of a systematic search for molecular outflows in 68 Very Low Luminosity Objects
(VeLLOs) from single-dish observations in CO isotopologues which find 16 VeLLOs showing clear
outflow signatures in the CO maps. With additional three VeLLOs from the literature, we analyzed
the outflow properties for 19 VeLLOs, identifying 15 VeLLOs as proto-Brown Dwarf (BD) candidates
and four VeLLOs as likely faint protostar candidates. The proto-BD candidates are found to have
a mass accretion rate ($\sim 10^{-8} - 10^{-7}$ $\rm M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) lower than that of the
protostar candidates ($\gtrsim 10^{-6}$ $\rm M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). Their accretion luminosities
are similar to or smaller than their internal luminosities, implying that many proto-BD candidates
might have had either small accretion activity in a quiescent manner throughout their lifetime,
or be currently exhibiting a relatively higher (or episodic) mass accretion than the past. There
are strong trends that outflows of many proto-BDs are less active if they are fainter or have less
massive envelopes. The outflow forces and internal luminosities for more than half of the proto-BD
candidates seem to follow an evolutionary track of a protostar with its initial envelope mass of
$\sim$0.08 $\rm M_{\odot}$, indicating that some BDs may form in less massive dense cores in a way
similar to normal stars. But, because there also exists a significant fraction (about 40%) of proto-BDs
with much weaker outflow force than expected by the relations for protostars, we should not rule
out the possibility of other formation mechanism for the BDs.
