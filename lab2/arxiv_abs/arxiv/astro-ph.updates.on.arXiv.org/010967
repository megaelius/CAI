We look at the contribution of different galaxy populations to the atomic hydrogen (HI) mass function
(HIMF) and the HI density parameter, $\Omega_{\text{HI}}$, in the local Universe. Our analysis
is based on a sample of 7857 HI-selected galaxies selected from a volume common to the SDSS and ALFALFA
surveys (40$\%$ catalog -- $\alpha.40$). We define different populations of galaxies in the color(u-r)-magnitude($M_{\text{r}}$)
plane and compute the HIMF for each of them. Additionally we compute the HIMF for dark galaxies; these
are undetected in SDSS and represent $\sim 2\%$ of the total sample. We find that the bright red population
dominates the total HIMF for $\log_{10}(M_{\text{HI}}h^2_{70}/M_{\odot}) \geq 10.4$. The full
red population -- bright and faint -- represents about $\sim 17\%$ of the $\Omega_{\text{HI}}$
budget, while that of the dark population is $\sim 3\%$. The HIMF about the knee, $\log_{10}(M_{\text{HI}}h^2_{70}/M_{\odot})
\in [8,10.4]$, is dominated by the faint and bright blue populations, the latter dominating at larger
masses in this interval. Their total contribution to $\Omega_{\text{HI}}$ is $\sim 55-70\%$,
the variation depending on the definition of population. The dominant populations at the low mass
end, $\log_{10}(M_{\text{HI}}h^2_{70}/M_{\odot}) \leq 8.0$ are the faint blue and faint bluer
populations, the latter's dominance being sensitive to its definition. The full blue (blue--bluer
bright and faint) population represents $\sim 80\%$ of $\Omega_{\text{HI}}$. A bimodal HIMF suggested
by our results is however not seen since the amplitude of the HIMF of the bright red population is small
compared to that of the bright blue population.
