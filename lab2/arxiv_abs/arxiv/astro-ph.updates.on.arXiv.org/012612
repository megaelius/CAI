The large brightness variation in the observed lightcurve of Oumuamua is probably related to its
shape, i.e., to the ratio between its longest axis and its shortest axis (aspect ratio). Several
approaches found the aspect ratio of Oumuamua to be unusually elongated. Moreover, the spin axis
orientation has to be almost perpendicular to the observer in order to obtain such an extreme lightcurve,
a configuration which is unlikely. However, interstellar Oumuamua may have different surface
properties than we know in our solar system. Therefore, in this work we widen the parameter space
for surface properties beyond the asteroid-like models and study its effect on the lightcurve of
Oumuamua. We calculate reflection from a rotating ellipsoidal object for four models: Lambertian
reflection, specular reflection, single scattering diffusive and backscatter. We then calculate
the probability to obtain a lightcurve ratio larger than the observed, as a function of the object
aspect ratio, assuming an isotopic spin orientation distribution. We find the elongation of Oumuamua
to be less extreme for the Lambertian and specular reflection models. Consequently, the probability
to observe the lightcurve ratio of Oumuamua given its unknown spin axis orientation is larger for
those models. We conclude that different surface reflection properties may suggest alternatives
to the extreme shape of Oumuamua, relieving the need for complicated formation scenario, extreme
albedo variation, or unnatural origin. Although the models suggested here are for ideal ellipsoidal
shape and ideal reflection method, the results emphasize the importance of surface properties
for the derived aspect ratio.
