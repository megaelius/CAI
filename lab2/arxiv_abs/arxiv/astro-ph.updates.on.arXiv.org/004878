We consider the role of diffusion in the redistribution of elements in the hot interstellar medium
(ISM) of early-type galaxies. It is well known that gravitational sedimentation can affect significantly
the abundances of helium and heavy elements in the intracluster gas of massive galaxy clusters.
The self-similarity of the temperature profiles and tight mass--temperature relation of relaxed
cool-core clusters suggest that the maximum effect of sedimentation take place in the most massive
virialized objects in the Universe. However, Chandra and XMM-Newton observations demonstrate
more complex scaling relations between the masses of early-type galaxies and other parameters,
such as the ISM temperature and gas mass fraction. An important fact is that early-type galaxies
can show both decreasing and increasing radial temperature profiles. We have calculated the diffusion
based on the observed gas density and temperature distributions for 13 early-type galaxies that
belonging to the different environments and cover a wide range of X-ray luminosities. To estimate
the maximum effect of sedimentation and thermal diffusion, we have solved the full set of Burgers'
equations for a non-magnetized ISM plasma. The results obtained demonstrate a considerable increase
of the He/H ratio within one effective radius for all galaxies of our sample. For galaxies with a flat
or declining radial temperature profile the average increase of the helium abundance is 60\% in
one billion years of diffusion. The revealed effect can introduce a significant bias in the metal
abundance measurements based on X-ray spectroscopy and can affect the evolution of stars that could
be formed from a gas with a high helium abundance.
