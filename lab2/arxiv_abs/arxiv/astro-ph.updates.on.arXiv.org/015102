Bringing a high-dimensional dataset into science-ready shape is a formidable challenge that often
necessitates data compression. Compression has accordingly become a key consideration for contemporary
cosmology, affecting public data releases, and reanalyses searching for new physics. However,
data compression optimized for a particular model can suppress signs of new physics, or even remove
them altogether. We therefore provide a solution for exploring new physics \emph{during} data
compression. In particular, we store additional agnostic compressed data points, selected to
enable precise constraints of non-standard physics at a later date. Our procedure is based on the
maximal compression of the MOPED algorithm, which optimally filters the data with respect to a baseline
model. We select additional filters, based on a generalised principal component analysis, which
are carefully constructed to scout for new physics at high precision and speed. We refer to the augmented
set of filters as MOPED-PC. They enable an analytic computation of Bayesian evidences that may indicate
the presence of new physics, and fast analytic estimates of best-fitting parameters when adopting
a specific non-standard theory, without further expensive MCMC analysis. As there may be large
numbers of non-standard theories, the speed of the method becomes essential. Should no new physics
be found, then our approach preserves the precision of the standard parameters. As a result, we achieve
very rapid and maximally precise constraints of standard and non-standard physics, with a technique
that scales well to large dimensional datasets.
