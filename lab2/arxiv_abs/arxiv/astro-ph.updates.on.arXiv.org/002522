Supernova (SN) explosions deposit prodigious energy and momentum in their environments, with
the former regulating multiphase thermal structure and the latter regulating turbulence and star
formation rates in the interstellar medium (ISM). In contrast to the extensive efforts developing
spherical models for SN remnant (SNR) evolution, systematic studies quantifying the impact of
SNe in more realistic inhomogeneous ISM conditions have been lacking. Using three-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations with optically-thin radiative cooling, we investigate the dependence
of radial momentum injection on both physical conditions (considering a range of mean density n=0.1-100)
and numerical parameters. Our inhomogeneous simulations adopt two-phase background states that
result from thermal instability in atomic gas. Although the SNR morphology becomes highly complex
for inhomogeneous backgrounds, the radial momentum injection is remarkably insensitive to environmental
details. For our two-phase simulations, the final momentum produced by a single SN is given by 2.8*10^5
M_sun*km/s n^{-0.17}. This is only 5% less than the momentum injection for a homogeneous environment
with the same mean density, and only 30% greater than the momentum at the time of shell formation.
The maximum mass in hot gas is quite insensitive to environmental inhomogeneity. Initial experiments
with multiple spatially-correlated SNe show a similar momentum per event to single-SN cases. We
also present a full numerical parameter study to assess convergence requirements. For convergence
in the momentum and other quantities, we find that the numerical resolution dx and the initial size
of the SNR r_init must satisfy dx, r_init<r_sf/3, where the shell formation radius is given by
r_sf = 30 pc n^{-0.46} for two-phase models (or 30% smaller for a homogeneous medium).
