We revisit double neutron star (DNS) formation in the classical binary evolution scenario in light
of the recent LIGO/Virgo DNS detection (GW170817). The observationally estimated Galactic DNS
merger rate of $R_{\rm MW}=21^{+28}_{-14}$ Myr$^{-1}$, based on 3 Galactic DNS systems, fully
supports our standard input physics model with $R_{\rm MW} =24$ Myr$^{-1}$. This estimate for the
Galaxy translates in a non-trivial way (due to cosmological evolution of progenitor stars in chemically
evolving Universe) into a local ($z\approx0$) DNS merger rate density of $R_{\rm local}=48$ Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$,
which {\em is not} consistent with the current LIGO/Virgo DNS merger rate estimate ($1540^{+3200}_{-1220}$
Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$). Within our study of the parameter space we find solutions that allow for
DNS merger rates as high as $R_{\rm local} \approx 600^{+600}_{-300}$ Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ which
are thus consistent with the LIGO/Virgo estimate. However, our corresponding BH-BH merger rates
for the models with high DNS merger rates exceed the current LIGO/Virgo estimate of local BH-BH merger
rate ($12$-$213$ Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$). Apart from being particularly sensitive to the common
envelope treatment, DNS merger rates are rather robust against variations of several of the key
factors probed in our study (e.g. mass transfer, angular momentum loss, natal kicks). This might
suggest that either common envelope development/survival works differently for DNS ($\sim$ 10-20
Msun stars) than for BH-BH ($\sim$ 40-100 Msun stars) progenitors, or high BH natal kicks are needed
to meet observational constraints for both types of binaries. Note that our conclusion is based
on a limited number of (21) evolutionary models and is valid only within this particular DNS and BH-BH
isolated binary formation scenario.
