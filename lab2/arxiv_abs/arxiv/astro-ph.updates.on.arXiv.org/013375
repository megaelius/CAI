Recent galaxy observations show that star formation activity changes depending on galactic environments.
In order to understand the diversity of galactic-scale star formation, it is crucial to understand
the formation and evolution of giant molecular clouds in an extreme environment. We focus on observational
evidence that bars in strongly barred galaxies lack massive stars even though quantities of molecular
gas are sufficient to form stars. In this paper, we present a hydrodynamical simulation of a strongly
barred galaxy, using a stellar potential which is taken from observational results of NGC1300,
and we compare cloud properties between different galactic environments: bar, bar-end and spiral
arms. We find that the mean of cloud's virial parameter is ~1 and that there is no environmental dependence,
indicating that the gravitationally-bound state of a cloud is not behind the observational evidence
of the lack of massive stars in strong bars. Instead, we focus on cloud-cloud collisions, which have
been proposed as a triggering mechanism for massive star formation. We find that the collision speed
in the bar is faster than those in the other regions. We examine the collision frequency using clouds'
kinematics and conclude that the fast collisions in the bar could originate from random-like motion
of clouds due to elliptical gas orbits shifted by the bar potential. These results suggest that the
observed regions of lack of active star-formation in the strong bar originate from the fast cloud-cloud
collisions, which are inefficient in forming massive stars, due to the galactic-scale violent
gas motion.
