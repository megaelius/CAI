We investigate the relationship between the turnaround radius ($R_t$) and the virial mass ($M_v$)
of cosmic structures in the context of $\Lambda$CDM model and in an $f(R)$ model of modified gravity
-- namely, the Hu-Sawicki model. The $R_t$ is the distance from the center of the cosmic structure
to the shell that is detaching from the Hubble flow at a given time, while the $M_v$ is defined, for
this work, as the mass enclosed within the volume where the density is $200$ times the background
density. We consider that gravitationally bound astrophysical systems follow a Navarro-Frenk-White
density profile, while beyond the virial radius ($R_v$) the profile is approximated by the 2-halo
term of the matter correlation function. By combining them together with the information drawn
from solving the spherical collapse for the structures, we are able to connect two observables:
the $R_t$ and the $M_v$. We show that, in $\Lambda$CDM, the turnaround mass ($M_t$) at $z=0$ is related
to the $M_v$ of that same structure by $M_t \simeq 3.07 \, M_v$, while in terms of the radii we have that
$R_t \simeq 3.7 \, R_v$ (for $M_v$ of $10^{13} \, h^{-1} \, M_\odot$). In the $f(R)$ model, we have
$M_t \simeq 3.43 \, M_v$ and $R_t \simeq 4.1 \, R_v$, for $|f_{R0}|=10^{-6}$ and the same mass scale.
Therefore, the difference between $\Lambda$CDM and $f(R)$ in terms of these observable relations
is of order $\sim 10-20\%$ even for a relatively mild strength of the modification of gravity ($|f_{R0}|=10^{-6}$).
For the $R_t$ itself we find a difference of $\sim 9\%$ between the weakly modification in gravity
considered in this work ($|f_{R0}|=10^{-6}$) and $\Lambda$CDM for a mass of $10^{13} \, h^{-1}
\, M_\odot$. Once observations allow precisions of this order or better in measurements $R_t$,
as well as the $M_v$, these quantities will become powerful tests of modified gravity.
