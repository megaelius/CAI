In previous works we introduced a nonlinear force-free method that self-consistently calculates
the instantaneous budgets of free magnetic energy and relative magnetic helicity in solar active
regions (ARs). Calculation is expedient and practical, using only a single vector magnetogram
per computation. We apply this method to a timeseries of 600 high-cadence vector magnetograms of
the eruptive NOAA AR 11158 acquired by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar Dynamics
Observatory over a five-day observing interval. Besides testing our method extensively, we use
it to interpret the dynamical evolution in the AR, including eruptions. We find that the AR builds
large budgets of both free magnetic energy and relative magnetic helicity, sufficient to power
many more eruptions than the ones it gave within the interval of interest. For each of these major
eruptions, we find eruption-related decreases and subsequent free-energy and helicity budgets
that are consistent with the observed eruption (flare and coronal-mass-ejection [CME]) sizes.
In addition, we find that (1) evolution in the AR is consistent with the recently proposed (free)
energy - (relative) helicity diagram of solar ARs, (2) eruption-related decreases occur {\it before}
the flare and the projected CME-launch times, suggesting that CME progenitors precede flares,
and (3) self-terms of free energy and relative helicity most likely originate from respective mutual-terms,
following a progressive mutual-to-self conversion pattern that most likely stems from magnetic
reconnection. This results in the non-ideal formation of increasingly helical pre-eruption structures
and instigates further research on the triggering of solar eruptions with magnetic helicity firmly
placed in the eruption cadre.
