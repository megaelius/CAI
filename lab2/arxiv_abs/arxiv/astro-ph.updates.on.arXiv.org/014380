The chemical enrichment in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies is regulated by several physical
processes: stellar evolution, grain formation and destruction, galactic inflows and outflows.
Understanding such processes is essential to follow the chemical enrichment of galaxies through
the cosmic epochs, and to interpret the observations. Despite the importance of such topics, the
efficiency of the different processes driving the evolution of baryons in galaxies, remain controversial.
We revise the current description of metal and dust evolution in local low-metallicity dwarf galaxies
and we develop a description for Lyman Break Galaxies. Our main goal is to reproduce i) the peak in
the mass of dust over the mass of stars (sMdust) observed within few hundred Myrs; ii) the decrease
of the sMdust at later time. The spectral energy distribution of the galaxies is fitted with the "Code
Investigating GALaxies Emission" (CIGALE), through which the stellar and dust masses, and the
star formation rate are estimated. For some of the dwarf galaxies, the metal and gas content are also
available. We run different calculations of chemical evolution in galaxies, and we fit the observed
properties through the model predictions. We show that i) a top-heavy initial mass function that
favours massive stars and a dust condensation fraction for Type II Supernovae (SNe II) of 50% or more
help to reproduce the peak of sMdust observed after 100 Myrs since the beginning of the cycle; ii)
galactic outflows play a crucial role in reproducing the decline in sMdust with age, and they are
more efficient than grain destruction from SNe II; iii) a star formation efficiency (mass of gas
converted into stars) of few per cent is required to explain the metallicity of local dwarf galaxies;
iv) dust growth in the ISM is not necessary to reproduce the sMdust and, if present, its effect is erased
by galactic outflows.
