The cosmological reionization can be studied in the radio through the tomographic view offered
by the redshifted 21-cm line and the integrated information carried out by the diffuse free-free
emission, coupled to the Comptonization distortion, relevant at higher frequencies. Current
predictions span a wide range of possibilities, while the recent EDGES observations disagree with
the standard models and call, if confirmed, for non-standard physical processes and/or for an early
population of extragalactic sources producing a remarkable background at high redshifts almost
consistent with the ARCADE 2 claim of a significant excess of CMB absolute temperature at low frequency.
These signatures can be observed in global signal and fluctuations, from very large to small angular
scales. The observer peculiar motion with respect to a reference frame in rest with respect to the
CMB produces boosting effects in various observable quantities, remarkable at low multipoles,
and particularly in the dipole, with frequency spectral behaviours depending on the monopole emission
spectrum. We present a novel investigation at radio frequencies, aimed at predicting the imprints
expected in the redshifted 21-cm line signal and in the diffuse free-free emission plus the Comptonization
distortion for several models. Furthermore, we consider the same type of signal but expected from
the cosmological radio background determining the offset for 21-cm line. The combination of these
signals and their relevance in the various frequency ranges are studied. This approach, linking
monopole and anisotropy analyses, can be applied on wide sky coverage surveys as well as to sets of
sky patches, and, relying only on the quality of interfrequency and relative data calibration,
in principle by-pass the need for precise absolute calibration, a critical point of current and
future radio interferometric facilities.
