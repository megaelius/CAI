We construct a model of the Cyclic Universe from a joint theory of General relativity, Thermodynamics
and Quantum information theory. Friedmann equations and the thermodynamical Gibbs-Duhem relation
determine a general form of the Hubble function which predicts a dynamical Dark Energy (DE) and a
dynamical Dark Matter (DM) described by new entropic terms and by the equations of state w_0=-1 and
w_M=0, respectively, at all z. We posit that the spacetime has a quantum structure described by the
Quantum information theory. We identify the space quanta \rho with two-qubit quantum states of
of massless gravitons with helicity states |\pm 2>. All space quanta carry quantum information
entropy S(\rho). All entangled quanta carry entanglement entropy S_E(\rho) and form DE. All non-entangled
quanta form DM. In the absence of Baryonic matter DM and SE are described by probability distributions
p(\vec{x},S) and q(\vec{x},\chi) where \chi=S_E(\rho)+S(\rho). Fisher information metric
generates from these distributions the vacuum gravitational fields of DM and DE. Tn the presence
of the Baryonic matter the distributions are displaced p->p' and q->q'. Fisher metric then defines
the displaced fields. In Einstein's theory of General relativity Space is a gravitational field
which we identify with the gravitational fields of DE and DM. The theory predicts the existence of
a new "residual" matter term with equation of state w_r=-1/3 in the Hubble function, and a negative
spatial curvature the consequence of which are constraints on cosmological parameters. We recover
Robertson-Walker metric and the Friedmann equations from the gravitational fields of Dark Energy
and Dark Matter at cosmological scales. The predictions of the theory are tested and confirmed in
the Part II of this work.
