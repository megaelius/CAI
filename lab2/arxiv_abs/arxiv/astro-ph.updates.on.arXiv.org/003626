We present near-infrared AMBER (R = 12, 000) and CRIRES (R = 100, 000) observations of the Herbig B[e]
star MWC297 in the hydrogen Br-gamma-line. Using the VLTI unit telescopes, we obtained a uv-coverage
suitable for aperture synthesis imaging. We interpret our velocity-resolved images as well as
the derived two-dimensional photocenter displacement vectors, and fit kinematic models to our
visibility and phase data in order to constrain the gas velocity field on sub-AU scales. The measured
continuum visibilities constrain the orientation of the near-infrared-emitting dust disk, where
we determine that the disk major axis is oriented along a position angle of 99.6 +/- 4.8 degrees. The
near-infrared continuum emission is 3.6 times more compact than the expected dust-sublimation
radius, possibly indicating the presence of highly refractory dust grains or optically thick gas
emission in the inner disk. Our velocity-resolved channel maps and moment maps reveal the motion
of the Br-gamma-emitting gas in six velocity channels, marking the first time that kinematic effects
in the sub-AU inner regions of a protoplanetary disk could be directly imaged. We find a rotation-dominated
velocity field, where the blue- and red-shifted emissions are displaced along a position angle
of 24 +/- 3 degrees and the approaching part of the disk is offset west of the star. The visibility drop
in the line as well as the strong non-zero phase signals can be modeled reasonably well assuming a
Keplerian velocity field, although this model is not able to explain the 3 sigma difference that
we measure between the position angle of the line photocenters and the position angle of the dust
disk. We find that the fit can be improved by adding an outflowing component to the velocity field,
as inspired by a magneto-centrifugal disk-wind scenario.
