In the past years, some extremely red brown dwarfs were found. They were believed to have low surface
gravity, but many of their spectral characteristics were similar to those of high surface gravity
brown dwarfs, showing that youth (or low surface gravity) spectral characteristics are poorly
understood. We aim to test surface gravity indicators in late-M and early-L brown dwarf spectra
using data obtained with the X-shooter spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. We selected a benchmark
sample of brown dwarfs members of Chamaeleon\,I ($\sim$2 Myr), Upper Scorpius (5$-$10~Myr), Pleiades
(132$\pm$27 Myr), and Praesepe (590$-$790 Myr) with well-constrained ages, and similar metallicities.
We provided a consistent spectral classification of the sample in the optical and in the near-infrared.
We measured the equivalent widths of their alkali lines, finding that they have a moderate correlation
with age, especially for objects with spectral types M8 and later. We used spectral indices defined
in the literature to estimate surface gravity, finding that their gravity assignment is accurate
for 75\% of our sample. We investigated the correlation between red colours and age, finding that
after $\sim$10~Myr, the colour does not change significantly for our sample {with spectral types
M6.0-L3.0}. In this case, red colours might be associated with circumstellar disks, {ring structures,
extinction, or viewing angle}. Finally, we calculated the {bolometric luminosity}, {and $J$ and
$K$ bolometric corrections} for our sample. We found that six objects are overluminous compared
to other members of the same association. Those objects are also flagged as binary candidates by
the $Gaia$ survey.
