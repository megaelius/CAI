The XMM-Newton observatory shows evidence with an $11 \sigma$ confidence level for seasonal variation
of the X-ray background in the near-Earth environment in the 2-6 keV energy range (Fraser et al. 2014).
The interpretation of the seasonal variation given in Fraser et al. 2014 was based on the assumption
that solar axions convert to X-rays in the Earth's magnetic field. There are many problems with this
interpretation, since the axion-photon conversion must preserve the directionality of the incoming
solar axion. At the same time, this direction is avoided by the observations because the XMM-Newton's
operations exclude pointing at the Sun and at the Earth. The observed seasonal variation suggests
that the signal could have a dark matter origin, since it is very difficult to explain with conventional
astrophysical sources. We propose an alternative explanation which involves the so-called Axion
Quark Nugget (AQN) dark matter model. In our proposal, dark matter is made of AQNs, which can cross
the Earth and emit high energy photons at their exit. We show that the emitted intensity and spectrum
is consistent with Fraser et al. 2014, and that our calculation is not sensitive to the specific details
of the model. We also find that our proposal predicts a large seasonal variation, on the level of 20-25%,
much larger than conventional dark matter models (1-10%). Since the AQN emission spectrum extends
up to $\sim$100 keV, well beyond the keV sensitivity of XMM-Newton, we predict the AQN contribution
to the hard X-ray and $\gamma$-ray backgrounds in the Earth's environment. The Gamma-Ray Burst
Monitor instrument (GBM), aboard the Fermi telescope, is sensitive to the 8 keV-40 MeV energy band.
We suggest that the multi-year archival data from the GBM could be used to search for a seasonal variation
in the near-Earth environment up to 100 keV as a future test of the AQN framework.
