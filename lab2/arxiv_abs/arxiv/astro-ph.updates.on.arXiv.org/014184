We present a study of the photochemistry of abiotic habitable planets with anoxic CO$_2$-N$_2$
atmospheres. Such worlds are representative of early Earth, Mars and Venus, and analogous exoplanets.
H$_2$O photodissociation controls the atmospheric photochemistry of these worlds through production
of reactive OH, which dominates the removal of atmospheric trace gases. The near-UV (NUV; $>200$
nm) absorption cross-sections of H$_2$O play an outsized role in OH production; these cross-sections
were heretofore unmeasured at habitable temperatures ($<373$ K). We present the first measurements
of NUV H$_2$O absorption at $292$ K, and show it to absorb orders of magnitude more than previously
assumed. To explore the implications of these new cross-sections, we employ a photochemical model;
we first intercompare it with two others and resolve past literature disagreement. The enhanced
OH production due to these higher cross-sections leads to efficient recombination of CO and O$_2$,
suppressing both by orders of magnitude relative to past predictions and eliminating the low-outgassing
"false positive" scenario for O$_2$ as a biosignature around solar-type stars. Enhanced [OH] increases
rainout of reductants to the surface, relevant to prebiotic chemistry, and may also suppress CH$_4$
and H$_2$; the latter depends on whether burial of reductants is inhibited on the underlying planet,
as is argued for abiotic worlds. While we focus on CO$_2$-rich worlds, our results are relevant to
anoxic planets in general. Overall, our work advances the state-of-the-art of photochemical models
by providing crucial new H$_2$O cross-sections and resolving past disagreement in the literature,
and suggests that detection of spectrally active trace gases like CO in rocky exoplanet atmospheres
may be more challenging than previously considered.
