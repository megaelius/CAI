The source of high-energy protons (>500 MeV) responsible for the so-called ground level enhancements
(GLEs) remains an open question in solar physics. One of the candidates is a shock wave driven by a
coronal mass ejection, which is thought to accelerate particles via diffusive-shock acceleration.
We perform physics-based simulations of proton acceleration using information on the shock and
ambient plasma parameters derived from the observation of a real GLE event. We analyse the simulation
results with the aim to find out which of the parameters are significant in controlling the acceleration
efficiency and to get a better understanding of the conditions under which the shock can produce
relativistic protons. We use results of the recently developed technique to determine the shock
and ambient plasma parameters, applied to the 17 May 2012 GLE event, and carry out proton acceleration
simulations with the Coronal Shock Acceleration model. We have performed proton acceleration
simulations for nine individual magnetic field lines characterised by various plasma conditions.
Analysis of the simulation results shows that the acceleration efficiency of the shock, i.e., its
ability to accelerate particles to high energies, tends to be higher for those shock portions that
are characterised by larger values of the scattering-centre compression ratio and/or the fast-mode
Mach number. At the same time, the acceleration efficiency can be strengthened due to enhanced plasma
density in the flux tube. Analysis of the delays between the flare onset and the production times
of protons of 1 GV rigidity for different field lines in our simulations, and a subsequent comparison
of those with the observed values indicate a possibility that quasi-perpendicular portions of
the shock play the main role in producing relativistic protons.
