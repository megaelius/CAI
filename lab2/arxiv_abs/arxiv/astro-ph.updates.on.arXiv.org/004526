The very-high-energy (VHE, $\gtrsim 100$ GeV) $\gamma$-ray MAGIC observations of the blazar S4
0954+65, were triggered by an exceptionally high flux state of emission in the optical. This blazar
has a disputed redshift of z=0.368 or z$\geqslant$0.45 and an uncertain classification among blazar
subclasses. The exceptional source state described here makes for an excellent opportunity to
understand physical processes in the jet of S4 0954+65 and thus contribute to its classification.
We investigate the multiwavelength (MWL) light curve and spectral energy distribution (SED) of
the S4 0954+65 blazar during an enhanced state in February 2015 and put it in context with possible
emission scenarios. We collect photometric data in radio, optical, X-ray, and $\gamma$ ray. We
study both the optical polarization and the inner parsec-scale jet behavior with 43 GHz data. Observations
with the MAGIC telescopes led to the first detection of S4 0954+65 at VHE. Simultaneous data with
Fermi-LAT at high energy $\gamma$ ray\ (HE, 100 MeV < E < 100 GeV) also show a period of increased activity.
Imaging at 43 GHz reveals the emergence of a new feature in the radio jet in coincidence with the VHE
flare. Simultaneous monitoring of the optical polarization angle reveals a rotation of approximately
100$^\circ$. (...) The broadband spectrum can be modeled with an emission mechanism commonly invoked
for flat spectrum radio quasars, i.e. inverse Compton scattering on an external soft photon field
from the dust torus, also known as external Compton. The light curve and SED phenomenology is consistent
with an interpretation of a blob propagating through a helical structured magnetic field and eventually
crossing a standing shock in the jet, a scenario typically applied to flat spectrum radio quasars
(FSRQs) and low-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (LBL).
