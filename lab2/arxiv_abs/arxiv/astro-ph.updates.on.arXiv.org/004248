Among the elements exhibiting non-mass dependent isotopic variations in meteorites, chromium
(Cr) has been central in arguing for an isotopic homogeneity between the Earth and the Moon. However,
the 54Cr isotope composition of the Moon relies on 2 samples only, which define an average value that
is slightly different from the terrestrial standard. Here, by determining the Cr isotopic composition
of 17 lunar, 9 terrestrial and 5 enstatite chondrite samples, we re-assess the isotopic similarity
between these different planetary bodies, and provide the first robust estimate for the Moon. In
average, terrestrial and enstatite samples show similar eps_54Cr. On the other hand, lunar samples
show variables excesses of 53Cr and 54Cr compared to terrestrial and enstatite chondrites samples
with correlated eps_53Cr and eps_54Cr (per 10,000 deviation of the 53Cr/52Cr and 54Cr/52Cr ratios
normalized to the 50Cr/52Cr ratio from Cr standard). Unlike previous suggestions, we show for the
first time that cosmic irradiation can affect significantly the Cr isotopic composition of lunar
materials. Moreover, we also suggest that rather than spallation reactions, neutron capture effects
are the dominant process controlling the Cr isotope composition of lunar igneous rocks. This is
supported by the correlation between eps_53Cr and eps_54Cr, and 150Sm/152Sm ratios. After correction
of these effects, the average eps_54Cr of the Moon is indistinguishable from the terrestrial and
enstatite chondrite materials reinforcing the idea of an Earth-Moon-Enstatite chondrite system
homogeneity. This is compatible with the most recent scenarios of Moon formation suggesting an
efficient physical homogenization after a high-energy impact on a fast spinning Earth, and/or
with an impactor originating from the same reservoir in the inner proto-planetary disk as the Earth
and enstatite chondrites and having similar composition.
