On November 4th, 2010, the Deep Impact eXtended Investigation (DIXI) successfully encountered
comet 103P/Hartley 2, when it was at a heliocentric distance of 1.06 AU. Spatially resolved near-IR
spectra of comet Hartley 2 were acquired in the 1.05-4.83 micron wavelength range using the HRI-IR
spectrometer. We present spectral maps of the inner ~10 kilometers of the coma collected 7 minutes
and 23 minutes after closest approach. The extracted reflectance spectra include well-defined
absorption bands near 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 micron consistent in position, bandwidth, and shape with
the presence of water ice grains. Using Hapke's radiative transfer model, we characterize the type
of mixing (areal vs. intimate), relative abundance, grain size, and spatial distribution of water
ice and refractories. Our modeling suggests that the dust, which dominates the innermost coma of
Hartley 2 and is at a temperature of 300K, is thermally and physically decoupled from the fine-grained
water ice particles, which are on the order of 1 micron in size. The strong correlation between the
water ice, dust, and CO2 spatial distribution supports the concept that CO2 gas drags the water ice
and dust grains from the nucleus. Once in the coma, the water ice begins subliming while the dust is
in a constant outflow. The derived water ice scale-length is compatible with the lifetimes expected
for 1-micron pure water ice grains at 1 AU, if velocities are near 0.5 m/s. Such velocities, about
three order of magnitudes lower than the expansion velocities expected for isolated 1-micron water
ice particles [Hanner, 1981; Whipple, 1951], suggest that the observed water ice grains are likely
aggregates.
