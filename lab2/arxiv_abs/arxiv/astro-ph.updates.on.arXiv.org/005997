Astrometric microlensing can be used to make precise measurements of the masses of lens stars that
are independent of their assumed internal physics. Such direct mass measurements, obtained purely
by observing the gravitational effects of the stars on external objects, are crucial for validating
theoretical stellar models. Specifically, astrometric microlensing allows direct mass measurements
of single stars for which so few measurements exist. To use the astrometric solutions and photometric
measurements of ~1.7 billion stars from Gaia Data Release 2 to predict microlensing events during
the nominal Gaia mission and beyond. This will enable astronomers to observe the entirety of each
event with appropriate observing resources. The data will allow precise lens mass measurements
for white dwarfs and low-mass main sequence stars helping to constrain stellar evolutionary models.
I search for source-lens pairs in GDR2 that could lead to events between 25/07/2014 and 25/07/2026.
I estimate lens masses using GDR2 photometry and parallaxes, and appropriate model isochrones.
Combined with source and lens parallax measurements from GDR2, this allows the Einstein radius
to be computed for each pair. By considering the paths on the sky, I calculate the microlensing signals
that are to be expected. I present a list of 76 predicted microlensing events. 9 and 5 astrometric
events will be caused by LAWD37 and Stein2051B. 9 events will exhibit detectable photometric and
astrometric signatures. Of the remaining events, ten will exhibit astrometric signals with amplitudes
above 0.5 mas, while the rest are low-amplitude astrometric events with amplitudes between 0.131
and 0.5 mas. 5 and 2 events will reach their peaks during 2018 and 2019. 5 of the photometric events
have the potential to evolve into high-magnification events, which may also probe for planetary
companions to the lenses.
