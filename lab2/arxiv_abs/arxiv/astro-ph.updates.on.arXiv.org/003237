Determining the properties of the warm ionized medium (WIM) at the leading edge of spiral arms is
important for understanding its dynamics and cloud formation. The inner edge of the Scutum arm tangency
is a unique location in which to disentangle the WIM from other components. We use high spectral resolution
[C II] 158 micron and [N II] 205 micron fine structure line observations taken with the upGREAT and
GREAT instruments on SOFIA, along with auxiliary HI and 13CO observations. The observations were
in and out of the Galactic plane along 18 lines of sight between longitude 30deg and 32deg. We detect
strong [N II] emission throughout the Scutum tangency. At VLSR = 110 to 125 km/s, where there is little,
if any, 13CO, we could disentangle the [N II] and [C II] emission that arises from the WIM at the inner
edge. We find an average electron density, <n(e)> about 0.9 cm{-3} in the plane, and about 0.4 cm{-3}
above the plane. For VLSR < 110 km/s there is [N II] emission tracing highly ionized gas throughout
the arm's molecular layer. This ionized gas has a high density, n(e) ~ 30 cm{-3}, and a few percent
filling factor. Thus, [N II] and [C II] at the Scutum arm tangency reveal a highly ionized gas with
<n(e)> about 10 to 20 times those of the interarm WIM, which is best explained by a model in which the
interarm WIM is compressed as it falls into the potential well of the arm. The widespread distribution
of [N II] in the molecular layers shows that high density ionized gas is distributed throughout the
Scutum arm. The n(e) derived from [N II] for these molecular cloud regions are about 30 cm{-3}, and
probably arise in the ionized boundary layers of clouds. This [N II] emission from the ionized boundary
layers is probably the result of the shock compression of the WIM as it impacts the arm's neutral gas,
but some could arise from extended HII regions.
