We present an analysis of the deepest Herschel images in four major extragalactic fields GOODS-North,
GOODS-South, UDS and COSMOS obtained within the GOODS-Herschel and CANDELS-Herschel key programs.
The picture provided by 10497 individual far-infrared detections is supplemented by the stacking
analysis of a mass-complete sample of 62361 star-forming galaxies from the CANDELS-HST H band-selected
catalogs and from two deep ground-based Ks band-selected catalogs in the GOODS-North and the COSMOS-wide
fields, in order to obtain one of the most accurate and unbiased understanding to date of the stellar
mass growth over the cosmic history. We show, for the first time, that stacking also provides a powerful
tool to determine the dispersion of a physical correlation and describe our method called "scatter
stacking" that may be easily generalized to other experiments. We demonstrate that galaxies of
all masses from z=4 to 0 follow a universal scaling law, the so-called main sequence of star-forming
galaxies. We find a universal close-to-linear slope of the logSFR-logM* relation with a non varying
dispersion of 0.3 dex. We also find evidence for a flattening of the main sequence at high masses (log(M*/Msun)
> 10.5) that becomes less prominent with increasing redshift and almost vanishes by z~2. It is
tempting to associate this bending with the parallel growth of quiescent bulges in star-forming
galaxies. The specific SFR (sSFR=SFR/M*) of star-forming galaxies is found to continuously increase
from z=0 to 4. Finally we discuss the implications of our findings on the cosmic SFR history and show
that more than two thirds of present-day stars must have formed in a regime dominated by the main sequence
mode. As a consequence we conclude that, although omnipresent in the distant Universe, galaxy mergers
had little impact in triggering strong starbursts over the last 12.5 Gyr.
