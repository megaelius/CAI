This Final Report (FR) presents the results of the Enhanced direct imaging exoplanet detection
with astrometry mass determination project, which was executed in support of NASA's Exoplanet
Exploration Program and the ROSES Technology Development for Exoplanet Missions (TDEM). The first
milestone is concerned with a demonstration of medium fidelity astrometry accuracy and the second
milestone demonstrates high-contrast imaging utilizing the same astrometry-capable optics.
We have met milestone #1 with a comfortable margin. The average accuracy obtained over the three
datasets is 5.75e-5 L/D, which is 4 times better than the milestone requirement, or equivalent to
2.5microarcsec on 2.4m telescope, or 1.5microarcsec for a 4m telescope, working in the visible
band. These results show the potential of this technique to enable detection and measure masses
of Earth-like planets around nearby stars, hence bringing a real benefit to the astronomy community.
We also met milestone #2 and demonstrated that it is possible to achieve high-contrast imaging utilizing
a coronagraph fed by a telescope equipped with a DP, enabling dual use of the telescope. We performed
three different high-contrast imaging runs and met the milestone #2 of 5e-7 raw contrast for all
of them. On average, we obtained 3.33e-7 raw contrast considering all data sets. This result is 35%
better than the milestone #2 requirement. We validated the stability of the high-contrast region
by averaging frames and subtracting the average from single frames, which resulted in contrast
improvement of approximately one order of magnitude, reaching 2.72e-8 contrast. The main achievement
of this work was the medium fidelity demonstration and feasibility validation of performing astrometry
and direct imaging using the same instrument, significantly enhancing the expected scientific
yield of dedicated exoplanet characterization missions.
