We perform a statistical inference of the astrophysical population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers
observed during the first two observing runs of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, including events
reported in the GWTC-1 and IAS catalogs. We derive a novel formalism to fully and consistently account
for events of arbitrary significance. We carry out a software injection campaign to obtain a set
of mock astrophysical events subject to our selection effects, and use the search background to
compute the astrophysical probabilities $p_{\rm astro}$ of candidate events for several phenomenological
models of the BBH population. Finally, we combine the information from individual events to infer
the rate, spin, mass, mass-ratio and redshift distributions of the mergers. The existing population
does not discriminate between random spins with a spread in the effective spin parameter, and a small
but nonzero fraction of events from tidally-torqued stellar progenitors. The mass distribution
is consistent with one having a cutoff at $m_{\rm max} = 41^{+10}_{-5}\,\rm M_\odot$, while the
mass ratio favors equal masses; the mean mass ratio $\bar q> 0.67$. The rate shows no significant
evolution with redshift. We show that the merger rate restricted to BBHs with a primary mass between
20 and $30\, \rm M_\odot$, and a mass ratio $q > 0.5$, and at $z \sim 0.2$, is 1.5 to $5.3\,{\rm Gpc^{-3}
yr^{-1}}$ (90\% c.l.); these bounds are model independent and a factor of $\sim 3$ tighter than that
on the local rate of all BBH mergers, and hence are a robust constraint on all progenitor models. Including
the events in our catalog increases the Fisher information about the BBH population by $\sim 47\%$,
and tightens the constraints on population parameters.
