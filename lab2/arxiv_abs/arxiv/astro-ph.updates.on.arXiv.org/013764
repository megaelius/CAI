The astrophysical origin of gravitational wave (GW) events is one of the most timely problems in
the wake of the LIGO/Virgo discoveries. In active galactic nuclei (AGN), binaries form and evolve
efficiently by dynamical interactions and gaseous dissipation. Previous studies have suggested
that binary black hole (BBH) mergers in AGN disks can contribute significantly to BBH mergers observed
by GW interferometers. Here we examine the distribution of the effective spin parameter $\chi_\mathrm{eff}$
of this GW source population. We extend our semi-analytical model of binary formation and evolution
in AGN disks by following the evolution of the binary orbital angular momenta and black hole (BH)
spins. BH spins change due to gas accretion and BH mergers, while the binary orbital angular momenta
evolve due to gas accretion and binary-single interactions. We find that the distribution of $\chi_\mathrm{eff}$
predicted by our AGN model is similar to the distribution observed during LIGO/Virgo O1 and O2. On
the other hand, if radial migration of BHs is inefficient, $\chi_\mathrm{eff}$ is skewed toward
higher values compared with the observed distribution, because of the paucity of scattering events
that would randomize spin directions relative to the orbital plane. We suggest that high binary
masses and the positive correlation between binary mass and the standard deviation of $\chi_\mathrm{eff}$
for chirp masses up to $\approx 20\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, can be possible signatures for mergers
originating in AGN disks. Finally, hierarchical mergers in AGN disks naturally produce properties
of the recent GW event GW190412, including a low mass ratio, a high primary BH spin, and a significant
spin component in the orbital plane.
