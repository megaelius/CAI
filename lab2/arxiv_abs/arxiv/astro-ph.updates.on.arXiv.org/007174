The chemical enrichments detected in CEMP-$s$ stars are believed to be the consequence of a mass-transfer
episode from a now extinct AGB primary star. This hypothesis is borne out by the fact that most CEMP-$s$
stars exhibit RV variations suggesting that they are in binary systems. We use the period distribution
of an observed sample of CEMP-$s$ stars to investigate the constraints it imposes on our models of
binary evolution and on the properties of the metal-poor binary population in the Galactic halo.
We simulate binary populations using different assumptions about the initial period distribution
and the mass-transfer process, and we compare the predicted period distributions of our synthetic
CEMP-$s$ stars with the observed one. With a set of default assumptions often made in binary population-synthesis
studies, the percentage of observed CEMP-$s$ systems with periods shorter than 2000 days is underestimated
by almost a factor of 3, and by a factor of 2 between 3000 and 10000 days, while 40% of the simulated systems
have periods longer than 10000 days, which is approximately the longest measured period among CEMP-$s$
stars. To reconcile the results of the models with the orbital properties of observed CEMP-$s$ stars,
one or both of the following conditions are necessary: ($i$) the specific angular momentum carried
away by the material that escapes the binary system is 2-5 times higher than currently predicted
by analytical models and hydrodynamical simulations of wind mass transfer, and ($ii$) the initial
period distribution of very metal-poor binary stars is significantly different from that observed
in the solar vicinity and weighted towards periods shorter than about 10000 days. Our simulations
show that some, perhaps all, of the observed CEMP-$s$ stars with apparently constant RV could be
undetected binaries with periods longer than 10000 days, but (...)
