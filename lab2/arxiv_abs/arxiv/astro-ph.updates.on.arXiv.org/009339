The properties of dense QCD matter are delineated through the construction of equations of state
which should be consistent with QCD calculations in the low and high density limits, nuclear laboratory
experiments, and the neutron star observations. These constraints, together with the causality
condition of the sound velocity, are used to develop the picture of hadron-quark continuity in which
hadronic matter continuously transforms into quark matter (modulo small 1st order phase transitions).
For hadronic matter (at baryon density nB > ~2n0 with n0 ~ 0.16 fm^(-3) being the nuclear saturation
density) we use equations of state by Togashi et al. based on microscopic variational many-body
calculations, and for quark matter (nB > ~5n0) we construct equations of state using a schematic
quark model (with strangeness) whose interactions are motivated by the hadron phenomenology.
The region between hadronic and quark matters (~2n0 < nB < ~5n0), which is most difficult to calculate,
is treated by highly constrained interpolation between nuclear and quark matter equations of state.
The resultant unified equation of state at zero temperature and beta-equilibrium, which we call
Quark-Hadron-Crossover (QHC18 and QHC19), is consistent with the measured properties of neutron
stars and in addition gives us microscopic insights into the properties of dense QCD matter. In particular
to ~10n0 the gluons can remain as non-perturbative as in vacuum and the strangeness can be as abundant
as up- and down-quarks at the core of two-solar mass neutron stars. Within our modeling the maximum
mass is found less than ~2.35 times solar mass and the baryon density at the core ranges in ~5-8n0.
