By using a large highly obscured ($N_{\rm H} > 10^{23}\ \rm cm^{-2}$) AGN sample (294 sources at $z
\sim 0-5$) selected from detailed X-ray spectral analyses in the deepest Chandra surveys, we explore
distributions of these X-ray sources in various optical/IR/X-ray color-color diagrams and their
host-galaxy properties, aiming at characterizing the nuclear obscuration environment and the
triggering mechanism of highly obscured AGNs. We find that the refined IRAC color-color diagram
fails to identify the majority of X-ray selected highly obscured AGNs, even for the most luminous
sources with ${\rm log}\,L_{\rm X}\, \rm (erg\ s^{-1}) > 44$. Over 80% of our sources will not be selected
as heavily obscured candidates using the flux ratio of $f_{\rm 24 \mu m}\, /\,f_R > 1000$ and $R - K
> 4.5$ criteria, implying complex origins and conditions for the obscuring materials that are responsible
for the heavy X-ray obscuration. The average star formation rate of highly obscured AGNs is similar
to that of stellar mass- ($M_*$-) and $z$-controlled normal galaxies, while the lack of quiescent
hosts is observed for the former. Partial correlation analyses imply that highly obscured AGN activity
(traced by $L_{\rm X}$) appears to be more fundamentally related to $M_*$, and no dependence of $N_{\rm
H}$ on either $M_*$ or SFR is detected. Morphology analyses reveal that 61% of our sources have a significant
disk component, while only 27% of them exhibit irregular morphological signatures. These findings
together point toward a scenario where secular processes (e.g., galactic-disk instabilities),
instead of mergers, are most probable to be the leading mechanism that triggers accretion activities
of X-ray-selected highly obscured AGNs.
