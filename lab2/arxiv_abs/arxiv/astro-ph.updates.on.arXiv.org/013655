In this paper, we present resolved observations of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, obtained
with the NIKA2 camera, towards the cluster of galaxies XLSSC102, a relatively low-mass system ($M_{500}
\sim 2 \times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$) at $z = 0.97$ detected from the XXL survey. We combine NIKA2 SZ
data, XMM-Newton X-ray data, and Megacam optical data to explore, respectively, the spatial distribution
of the gas electron pressure, the gas density, and the galaxies themselves. We find significant
offsets between the X-ray peak, the SZ peak, the brightest cluster galaxy, and the peak of galaxy
density. Additionally, the galaxy distribution and the gas present elongated morphologies. This
is interpreted as the sign of a recent major merging event, which induced a local boost of the gas pressure
towards the north of XLSSC102 and stripped the gas out of the galaxy group. The NIKA2 data are also
combined with XXL data to construct the thermodynamic profiles of XLSSC102, obtaining relatively
tight constraints up to about $\sim r_{500}$, and revealing properties that are typical of disturbed
systems. We also explore the impact of the cluster centre definition and the implication of local
pressure substructure on the recovered profiles. Finally, we derive the global properties of XLSSC102
and compare them to those of high-mass-and-low-redshift systems, finding no strong evidence for
non-standard evolution. We also use scaling relations to obtain alternative mass estimates from
our profiles. The variation between these different mass estimates reflects the difficulty to
accurately measure the mass of low-mass clusters at z$\sim$1, especially with low signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N) data and for a disturbed system. However, it also highlights the strength of resolved
SZ observations alone and in combination with survey-like X-ray data.
