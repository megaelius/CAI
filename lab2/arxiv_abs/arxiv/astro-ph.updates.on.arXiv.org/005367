The fraction of ionizing photons that escape high-redshift galaxies sensitively determines whether
galaxies reionized the early universe. However, this escape fraction cannot be measured from high-redshift
galaxies because the opacity of the intergalactic medium is large at high redshifts. Without methods
to indirectly measure the escape fraction of high-redshift galaxies, it is unlikely that we will
know what reionized the universe. Here, we analyze the far-ultraviolet (UV) H I (Lyman series) and
low-ionization metal absorption lines of nine low-redshift, confirmed Lyman continuum emitting
galaxies. We use the H I covering fractions, column densities, and dust attenuations measured in
a companion paper to predict the escape fraction of ionizing photons. We find good agreement between
the predicted and observed Lyman continuum escape fractions (within $1.4\sigma$) using both the
H I and ISM absorption lines. The ionizing photons escape through holes in the H I, but we show that
dust attenuation reduces the fraction of photons that escape galaxies. This means that the average
high-redshift galaxy likely emits more ionizing photons than low-redshift galaxies. Two other
indirect methods accurately predict the escape fractions: the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction and
the optical [O III]/[O II] flux ratio. We use these indirect methods to predict the escape fraction
of a sample of 21 galaxies with rest-frame UV spectra but without Lyman continuum observations.
Many of these galaxies have low escape fractions ($f_{\rm esc} \le 1$\%), but 11 have escape fractions
$>1$\%. The methods presented here will measure the escape fractions of high-redshift galaxies,
enabling future telescopes to determine whether star-forming galaxies reionized the early universe.
