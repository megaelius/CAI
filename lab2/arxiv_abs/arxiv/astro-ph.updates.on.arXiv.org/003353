Exoplanet Proxima b will be an important laboratory for the search for extraterrestrial life for
the decades ahead. Here we discuss the prospects of detecting carbon dioxide at 15 um using a spectral
filtering technique with the Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) mode of the Mid-Infrared Instrument
(MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). At superior conjunction, the planet is expected
to show a contrast of up to 100 ppm with respect to the star. At a spectral resolving power of R=1790-2640,
about 100 spectral CO2 features are visible within the 13.2-15.8 um (3B) band, which can be combined
to boost the planet atmospheric signal by a factor 3-4, depending on the atmospheric temperature
structure and CO2 abundance. If atmospheric conditions are favorable (assuming an Earth-like
atmosphere), with this new application to the cross-correlation technique carbon dioxide can
be detected within a few days of JWST observations. However, this can only be achieved if both the
instrumental spectral response and the stellar spectrum can be determined to a relative precision
of <= 1e-4 between adjacent spectral channels. Absolute flux calibration is not required, and the
method is insensitive to the strong broadband variability of the host star. Precise calibration
of the spectral features of the host star may only be attainable by obtaining deep observations of
the system during inferior conjunction that serve as a reference. The high-pass filter spectroscopic
technique with the MIRI MRS can be tested on warm Jupiters, Neptunes, and super-Earths with significantly
higher planet/star contrast ratios than the Proxima system.
