We present a new, open source, free semi-analytic model (SAM), named Shark, which is designed to
be highly flexible and modular, allowing an easy and systematic exploration of different physical
processes and ways of modelling any one of them. We introduce the philosophy behind the building
of Shark, and provide a detailed overview of the physical processes and their variants included
in the model. Shark is written in C++11 and has been parallelized with OpenMP to allow for efficient
exploration of models and parameters. In the version being released (v1.0), we implement several
different models for gas cooling, active galactic nuclei, stellar and photo-ionisation feedback,
and star formation. We demonstrate the basic performance of Shark using the SURFS simulations on
the Planck15 cosmology, by comparing results against a large set of observations, including: the
stellar mass function (SMF) and stellar-halo mass relation from z=0 to z=4; the cosmic evolution
of the star formation rate density (SFRD), stellar mass, atomic and molecular hydrogen; local gas
scaling relations; and structural galaxy properties, finding excellent agreement. Some of these
are by construction, as parameters are, for example, tuned to the SMF at z=0, but most are true successes
of Shark. We illustrate how Shark can be used to study the systematic effects of the modelling of different
physical processes on the galaxy population, by quantifying the sensitivity of the scatter of the
main sequence of star formation and the gas scaling relations on the adopted star formation law and
of the SFRD and $\Omega_{\rm H_2}$ on the H$_2$ depletion timescale of starbursts. We compare Shark
with other SAMs and the hydrodynamical simulation EAGLE, and find that SAMs have a much higher halo
baryon fraction due to large amounts of intra-halo gas, which in the case of EAGLE is in the intergalactic
medium.
