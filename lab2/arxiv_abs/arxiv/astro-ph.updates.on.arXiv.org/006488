AXIS is a probe-class concept under study for submission to the 2020 Decadal Survey. AXIS will extend
and enhance the science of high angular resolution X-ray imaging and spectroscopy in the next decade
with $\sim 0.4''$ resolution over a 24$' \times 24'$ field of view, with 0.3$"$ in the central 14$'
\times 14'$, and ~10x more collecting area than Chandra. These capabilities are made possible by
precision-polished lightweight single-crystal silicon optics achieving both high angular resolution
and large collecting area, and next generation small-pixel silicon detectors adequately sampling
the point spread function and allowing timing science and preventing pile up with high read-out
rate. We have selected a low earth orbit to enable rapid target of opportunity response, similar
to Swift, with a high observing efficiency, low detector background and long detector life. The
combination opens a wide variety of new and exciting science such as: (1) measuring the event horizon
scale structure in AGN accretion disks and the spins of supermassive black holes through observations
of gravitationally-microlensed quasars; (ii) determining AGN and starburst feedback in galaxies
and galaxy clusters through direct imaging of winds and interaction of jets and via spatially resolved
imaging of galaxies at high-z; (iii) fueling of AGN by probing the Bondi radius of over 20 nearby galaxies;
(iv) hierarchical structure formation and the SMBH merger rate through measurement of the occurrence
rate of dual AGN and occupation fraction of SMBHs; (v) advancing SNR physics and galaxy ecology through
large detailed samples of SNR in nearby galaxies; (vi) measuring the Cosmic Web through its connection
to cluster outskirts; (vii) a wide variety of time domain science including rapid response to ToOs.
With a nominal 2028 launch, AXIS benefits from natural synergies with the ELTs, LSST, ALMA, WFIRST
and ATHENA.
