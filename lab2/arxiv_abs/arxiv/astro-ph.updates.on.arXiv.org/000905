We investigate the impact of dust-induced gas fragmentation on the formation of the first low-mass,
metal-poor stars (< 1M_sun) in the early universe. Previous work has posited the existence of
a critical dust-to-gas ratio, below which dust thermal cooling is unable to cause fragmentation.
Using silicon-based (rather than carbon-based) dust compositions, we compute such critical dust-to-gas
ratios and associated critical silicon abundances. We evaluate the robustness of these critical
values by considering variations in the dust chemical composition, grain size distribution, and
star formation environment. Variations in the dust chemical composition are less important than
variations in the size distribution, and the most likely environment where dust cooling becomes
significant is in a rotationally supported protostellar disk. We test the dust cooling theory by
comparing to silicon abundances observed in metal-poor stars. Several stars have silicon abundances
low enough to rule out fragmentation induced by dust which follows a standard Milky Way grain size
distribution. Moreover, two of the most iron-poor stars have such low silicon abundances that even
dust with a shocked grain size distribution cannot easily explain their formation. We see evidence
that stars with [Fe/H] < -4.0 exhibit either high carbon and low silicon abundances or the reverse.
This suggests that the earliest low-mass star formation in the most metal-poor regime likely proceeded
through two distinct pathways, one that relied on fine structure cooling and one that relied on dust
cooling. This naturally explains both the carbon-rich and carbon-normal stars at extremely low
[Fe/H].
