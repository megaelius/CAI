We have conducted ALMA CO isotopes and 1.3 mm continuum observations toward filamentary molecular
clouds of the N159W-South region in the Large Magellanic Cloud with an angular resolution of $\sim$0."25
($\sim$0.07 pc). Although the previous lower resolution ($\sim$1") ALMA observations revealed
that there is a high-mass protostellar object at an intersection of two linear-shaped filaments
in $^{13}$CO with the length scale of $\sim$10 pc (Fukui et al. 2015), the spatially resolved observations,
in particular, toward the highest column density part traced by the 1.3 mm continuum emission, the
N159W-South clump, show complicated hub-filamentary structures. We also discovered that there
are multiple protostellar sources with bipolar outflows along the massive filament. The redshifted/blueshifted
components of the $^{13}$CO emission around the massive filaments/protostars show complementary
distributions to each other, which is considered to be a possible piece of evidence for a cloud-cloud
collision. We propose a new scenario that the supersonically colliding gas flow triggered the formation
of both the massive filament and protostars. This is a modification of the earlier scenario of cloud-cloud
collision which postulated the two filamentary clouds prior to the high-mass star formation by
Fukui et al. (2015). A recent theoretical study of the shock compression in colliding molecular
flows by Inoue et al. (2018) demonstrates that the formation of filaments with hub-structure is
a usual outcome of the collision, lending support for the present scenario. In the theory the filaments
are formed as dense parts in a shock compressed sheet-like layer, which resembles "an umbrella with
pokes".
