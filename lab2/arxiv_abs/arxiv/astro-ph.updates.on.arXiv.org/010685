We present results from three world-wide campaigns that resulted in the detections of two single-chord
and one multi-chord stellar occultations by the Plutino object (84922) 2003~VS$_2$. From the single-chord
occultations in 2013 and 2014 we obtained accurate astrometric positions for the object, while
from the multi-chord occultation on November 7th, 2014, we obtained the parameters of the best-fitting
ellipse to the limb of the body at the time of occultation. We also obtained short-term photometry
data for the body in order to derive its rotational phase during the occultation. The rotational
light curve present a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.141 $\pm$ 0.009 mag. This allows us to reconstruct
the three-dimensional shape of the body, with principal semi-axes $a = 313.8 \pm 7.1$ km, $b = 265.5^{+8.8}_{-9.8}$
km, and $c = 247.3^{+26.6}_{-43.6}$ km, which is not consistent with a Jacobi triaxial equilibrium
figure. The derived spherical volume equivalent diameter of $548.3 ^{+29.5}_{-44.6}$ km is about
5\% larger than the radiometric diameter of 2003~VS$_2$ derived from Herschel data of $523 \pm 35$
km, but still compatible with it within error bars. From those results we can also derive the geometric
albedo ($0.123 ^{+0.015}_{-0.014}$) and, under the assumption that the object is a Maclaurin spheroid,
the density $\rho = 1400^{+1000}_{-300}$ for the plutino. The disappearances and reappearances
of the star during the occultations do not show any compelling evidence for a global atmosphere considering
a pressure upper limit of about 1 microbar for a pure nitrogen atmosphere, nor secondary features
(e.g. rings or satellite) around the main body.
