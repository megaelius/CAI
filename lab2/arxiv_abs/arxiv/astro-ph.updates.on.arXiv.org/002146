The methods by which one characterizes the distribution of matter in cosmological simulations
is intrinsically different from how one performs the same task observationally. In this paper,
we make substantial steps towards comparing simulations and observations of the intergalactic
medium (IGM) in a more sensible way. We present a pipeline that generates and fits synthetic QSO absorption
spectra using sight lines cast through a cosmological simulation, and simultaneously identifies
structure by directly analyzing the variations in HI and OVI number density. We compare synthetic
absorption spectra with a less observationally motivated, but more straightforward density threshold-based
method for finding absorbers. Our efforts focus on HI and OVI to better characterize the warm/hot
intergalactic medium, a subset of the IGM that is challenging to conclusively identify observationally.
We find that the two methods trace roughly the same quantities of HI and OVI above observable column
density limits, but the synthetic spectra typically identify more substructure in absorbers.
We use both methods to characterize HI and OVI absorber properties. We find that both integrated
and differential column density distributions from both methods generally agree with observations.
The distribution of Doppler parameters between the two methods are similar for Lya and compare reasonably
with observational results, but while the two methods agree with each other with OVI systems, they
both are systematically different from observations. We find a strong correlation between OVI
baryon fraction and OVI column density. We also discuss a possible bimodality in the temperature
distribution of the gas traced by OVI.
