Astrometric positions of moving objects in the Solar System have been measured using a variety of
star catalogs in the past. Previous work has shown that systematic errors in star catalogs can affect
the accuracy of astrometric observations. That, in turn, can influence the resulting orbit fits
for minor planets. In order to quantify these systematic errors, we compare the positions and proper
motion of stellar sources in the most utilized star catalogs to the second release of the Gaia star
catalog. The accuracy of Gaia astrometry allows us to unambiguously identify local biases and derive
a scheme that can be used to correct past astrometric observations of solar system objects. Here
we provide a substantially improved debiasing scheme for 26 astrometric catalogs that were extensively
used in minor planet astrometry. Revised corrections near the galactic center eliminate artifacts
that could be traced back to reference catalogs used in previous debiasing schemes. Median differences
in stellar positions between catalogs now tend to be on the order of several tens of milliarcseconds
(mas) but can be as large as 175 mas. Median stellar proper motion corrections scatter around 0.3
mas/yr and range from 1 to 4 mas/yr for star catalogs with and without proper motion, respectively.
The tables in this work are meant to be applied to existing optical observations. They are not intended
to correct new astrometric measurments as those should make use of the Gaia astrometric catalog.
Since previous debiasing schemes already reduced systematics in past observations to a large extent,
corrections beyond the current work may not be needed in the foreseeable future.
