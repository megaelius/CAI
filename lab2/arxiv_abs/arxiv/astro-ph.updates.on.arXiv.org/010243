We take advantage of a set of molecular cloud simulations to demonstrate a possibility to uncover
statistical properties of the gas density and velocity fields using reflected emission of a short
(with duration much less than the cloud's light-crossing time) X-ray flare. Such situation is relevant
for the Central Molecular Zone of our Galaxy where several clouds get illuminated by a $\sim110$
yr-old flare from the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. Due to shortness of the flare ($\Delta t\lesssim1.6$
yrs), only a thin slice ($\Delta z\lesssim0.5$ pc) of the molecular gas contributes to the X-ray
reflection signal at any given moment, and its surface brightness effectively probes the $local$
gas density. This allows reconstructing the density probability distribution function over a
broad range of scales with virtually no influence of attenuation, chemo-dynamical biases and projection
effects. Such measurement is key to understanding the structure and star-formation potential
of the clouds evolving under extreme conditions in the CMZ. For cloud parameters similar to the currently
brightest in X-ray reflection molecular complex Sgr A, the sensitivity level of the best available
data is sufficient for marginal distinction between solenoidal and compressive forcing of turbulence.
Future-generation X-ray observatories with large effective area and high spectral resolution
will dramatically improve on that by minimising systematic uncertainties due to contaminating
signals. Furthermore, measurement of the iron fluorescent line centroid with sub-eV accuracy
in combination with the data on molecular line emission will allow direct investigation of the gas
velocity field.
