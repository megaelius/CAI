The advent of new sub-millimeter observational facilities has stimulated the desire to model the
sub-mm line emission of galaxies within cosmological galaxy formation models. This is typically
done in post-processing by applying sub-resolution recipes to describe the properties of the unresolved
interstellar medium. At the same time, while there is freedom in how one implements these sorts of
recipes, the impact of various choices has yet to be systematically explored in simulations. In
this paper, we do just that. We combine a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation with chemical equilibrium
networks and numerical radiative transfer models and explore how different choices for the sub-grid
modeling affect the predicted CO, [CI], and [CII] emission of galaxies. We find that a key component
for a successful model includes a molecular cloud mass-size relation and scaling for the ultraviolet
and cosmic ray radiation field that varies based on local ISM properties. Our most successful model
adopts a Plummer profile for the radial density distribution of gas within molecular clouds. On
the other hand, different assumptions for the clumping of gas within molecular clouds and changes
in the slope of the molecular cloud mass distribution function hardly affect the CO, [CI], and [CII]
luminosities of galaxies. At fixed star-formation rate the [CII]-SFR ratio of galaxies scales
inversely with the pressure acting on molecular clouds, increasing the molecular clouds density
and hence decreasing the importance of [CII] line cooling. Overall we find that it is essential that
a wide range of sub-mm emission lines arising in vastly different phases of the ISM are used as model
constraints in order to limit the freedom in sub-grid choices and we present the details of the most
successful model variant.
