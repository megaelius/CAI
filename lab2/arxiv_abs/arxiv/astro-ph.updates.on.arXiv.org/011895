We present one-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations including radiative losses, of internal
shocks in the outflows from classical novae, to explore the role of shocks in powering multi-wavelength
emission from radio to gamma-ray wavelengths. Observations support a picture in which the initial
phases of some novae generate a slow, equatorially-focused outflow (directly from the outer Lagrange
point, or from a circumbinary disk), which then transitions to, or is overtaken by, a faster more
isotropic outflow from the white dwarf which collides and shocks the slower flow, powering gamma-ray
and optical emission through reprocessing by the ejecta. However, the common occurence of multiple
peaks in nova light curves suggests that the outflow's acceleration need not be monotonic, but instead
can involve successive transitions between "fast" and "slow" modes. Such a time-fluctuating outflow
velocity naturally can reproduce several observed properties of nova, such as correlated gamma-ray
and optical flares, expansion of the photosphere coincident with (though lagging slightly) the
peak flare luminosity, and complex time-evolution of spectral lines (including accelerating,
decelerating, and merging velocity components). While the shocks are still deeply embedded during
the gamma-ray emission, the onset of $\sim$ keV X-ray and $\sim 10$ GHz radio synchrotron emission
is typically delayed until the forward shock of the outermost monolithic shell (created by merger
of multiple internal shock-generated shells) reaches a sufficiently low column through the dense
external medium generated by the earliest phase of the outburst.
