Estimates of the photospheric magnetic, electric and plasma velocity fields are essential for
studying the dynamics of the solar atmosphere, for example through the derivative quantities of
Poynting and relative helicity flux and by using of the fields to obtain the lower boundary condition
for data-driven coronal simulations. In this paper we study the performance of a data processing
and electric field inversion approach that requires only high-resolution and high-cadence line-of-sight
or vector magnetograms -- which we obtain from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The approach does not require any photospheric velocity estimates,
and the lacking velocity information is compensated using ad hoc assumptions. We show that the free
parameters of these assumptions can be optimized to reproduce the time evolution of the total magnetic
energy injection through the photosphere in NOAA AR 11158, when compared to the recent estimates
for this active region. However, we find that the relative magnetic helicity injection is reproduced
poorly reaching at best a modest underestimation. We discuss also the effect of some of the data processing
details on the results, including the masking of the noise-dominated pixels and the tracking method
of the active region, both of which have not received much attention in the literature so far. In most
cases the effect of these details is small, but when the optimization of the free parameters of the
ad hoc assumptions is considered a consistent use of the noise mask is required. The results found
in this paper imply that the data processing and electric field inversion approach that uses only
the photospheric magnetic field information offers a flexible and straightforward way to obtain
photospheric magnetic and electric field estimates suitable for practical applications such
as coronal modeling studies.
