Very low Earth orbits (VLEO), typically classified as orbits below 450 km to 500 km in altitude, have
the potential to provide significant benefits to spacecraft over those that operate in higher altitude
orbits. This paper provides a comprehensive review and analysis of these benefits to spacecraft
operations in VLEO, with parametric investigation of those which apply specifically to Earth observation
missions. The most significant benefit for optical imaging systems is that a reduction in orbital
altitude improves spatial resolution for a similar payload specification. Alternatively mass
and volume savings can be made whilst maintaining a given performance. Similarly, for radar and
lidar systems, the signal-to-noise ratio can be improved. Additional benefits include improved
geospatial position accuracy, improvements in communications link-budgets, and greater launch
vehicle insertion capability. The collision risk with orbital debris and radiation environment
can be shown to be improved in lower altitude orbits, whilst compliance with IADC guidelines for
spacecraft post-mission lifetime and deorbit is also assisted. Finally, VLEO offers opportunities
to exploit novel atmosphere-breathing electric propulsion systems and aerodynamic attitude
and orbit control methods. However, key challenges associated with our understanding of the lower
thermosphere, aerodynamic drag, the requirement to provide a meaningful orbital lifetime whilst
minimising spacecraft mass and complexity, and atomic oxygen erosion still require further research.
Given the scope for significant commercial, societal, and environmental impact which can be realised
with higher performing Earth observation platforms, renewed research efforts to address the challenges
associated with VLEO operations are required.
