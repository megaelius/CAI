The LIGO/Virgo collaboration has reported the detection of GW190412, a black hole-black hole (BH-BH)
merger with the most unequal masses to date: m1=24.4-34.7Msun and m2=7.4-10.1Msun, corresponding
to a mass ratio of q=0.21--0.41. Additionally, GW190412's effective spin was estimated to be Xeff=0.14-0.34,
with the spin of the primary BH in the range a_spin=0.17-0.59. Based on this and prior detections,
more than 10 percent BH-BH mergers have q<0.4. Major BH-BH formation channels (i.e., dynamics in
dense stellar systems, classical isolated binary evolution, or chemically homogeneous evolution)
tend to produce BH-BH mergers with comparable masses (typically with q>0.5). Here we test whether
the classical isolated binary evolution channel can produce mergers resembling GW190412. We show
that our standard binary evolution scenario, with the typical assumptions on input physics we have
used in the past, produces such mergers. For this particular model of the input physics the overall
BH-BH merger rate density in the local Universe (z=0) is: 73.5 Gpc^-3 yr^-1, while for systems with
q<0.41 the rate density is: 6.8 Gpc^-3 yr^-1. The results from our standard model are consistent
with the masses and spins of the black holes in GW190412, as well as with the LIGO/Virgo estimate of
the fraction of unequal-mass BH-BH mergers. As GW190412 shows some weak evidence for misaligned
spins, we provide distribution of precession parameter in our models and conclude that if among
the new LIGO/Virgo detections the evidence of system precession is strong and more than 10 percent
of BH-BH mergers have large in-plane spin components (Xp>0.5) then common envelope isolated binary
BH-BH formation channel can be excluded as their origin.
