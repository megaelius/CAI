In this paper we present the results of the first low frequency all-sky search of continuous gravitational
wave signals conducted on Virgo VSR2 and VSR4 data. The search covered the full sky, a frequency range
between 20 Hz and 128 Hz with a range of spin-down between $-1.0 \times 10^{-10}$ Hz/s and $+1.5 \times
10^{-11}$ Hz/s, and was based on a hierarchical approach. The starting point was a set of short Fast
Fourier Transforms (FFT), of length 8192 seconds, built from the calibrated strain data. Aggressive
data cleaning, both in the time and frequency domains, has been done in order to remove, as much as
possible, the effect of disturbances of instrumental origin. On each dataset a number of candidates
has been selected, using the FrequencyHough transform in an incoherent step. Only coincident candidates
among VSR2 and VSR4 have been examined in order to strongly reduce the false alarm probability, and
the most significant candidates have been selected. Selected candidates have been subject to a
follow-up by constructing a new set of longer FFTs followed by a further incoherent analysis, still
based on the FrequencyHough transform. No evidence for continuous gravitational wave signals
was found, therefore we have set a population-based joint VSR2-VSR4 90$\%$ confidence level upper
limit on the dimensionless gravitational wave strain in the frequency range between 20 Hz and 128
Hz. This is the first all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves conducted, on data of ground-based
interferometric detectors, at frequencies below 50 Hz. We set upper limits in the range between
about $10^{-24}$ and $2\times 10^{-23}$ at most frequencies. Our upper limits on signal strain
show an improvement of up to a factor of $\sim$2 with respect to the results of previous all-sky searches
at frequencies below $80~\mathrm{Hz}$.
