We measure the radial profiles of the stellar velocity dispersions, $\sigma(R)$, for 90 early-type
galaxies (ETGs) in the MASSIVE survey, a volume-limited integral-field spectroscopic (IFS) galaxy
survey targeting all northern-sky ETGs with absolute $K$-band magnitude $M_K < -25.3$ mag, or stellar
mass $M_* > 4 \times 10^{11} M_\odot$, within 108 Mpc. Our wide-field 107" $\times$ 107" IFS data
cover radii as large as 40 kpc, for which we quantify separately the inner (2 kpc) and outer (20 kpc)
logarithmic slopes $\gamma_{\rm inner}$ and $\gamma_{\rm outer}$ of $\sigma(R)$. While $\gamma_{\rm
inner}$ is mostly negative, of the 56 galaxies with sufficient radial coverage to determine $\gamma_{\rm
outer}$ we find 36% to have rising outer dispersion profiles, 30% to be flat within the uncertainties,
and 34% to be falling. The fraction of galaxies with rising outer profiles increases with $M_*$ and
in denser galaxy environment, with 10 of the 11 most massive galaxies in our sample having flat or
rising dispersion profiles. The strongest environmental correlations are with local density
and halo mass, but a weaker correlation with large-scale density also exists. The average $\gamma_{\rm
outer}$ is similar for brightest group galaxies, satellites, and isolated galaxies in our sample.
We find a clear positive correlation between the gradients of the outer dispersion profile and the
gradients of the velocity kurtosis $h_4$. Altogether, our kinematic results suggest that the increasing
fraction of rising dispersion profiles in the most massive ETGs are caused (at least in part) by variations
in the total mass profiles rather than in the velocity anisotropy alone.
