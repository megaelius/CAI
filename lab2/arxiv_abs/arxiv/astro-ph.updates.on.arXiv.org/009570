The symbiotic binary MWC 560 (=V694 Mon) is a laboratory for the complex relationship between an
accretion disk and its outflow. In 2016, at the peak of a slow rise in optical flux, the maximum velocity
of the broad absorption line outflow abruptly doubled to at least 2500 km s$^{-1}$. The sudden onset
of high-velocity Balmer absorption coincided with remarkable developments indicating an increase
in outflow power: optically-thin thermal radio emission began rising by about 20 $\mu$Jy/month,
and soft X-ray flux increased by an order of magnitude. Comparison to historical data suggests that
both high-velocity and low-velocity optical outflow components must be simultaneously present
to yield a large soft X-ray flux, which may originate in a shock where these fast and slow absorbers
collide. Balmer absorption and the enduring Fe II ultraviolet absorption curtain demonstrate
that the absorption line-producing outflow was consistently fast and dense ($\gtrsim10^{6.5}$
cm$^{-3}$) throughout the 2016 outflow fast state, steadily feeding a lower-density ($\lesssim10^{5.5}$
cm$^{-3}$) region of radio-emitting gas. Persistent optical and near-ultraviolet flickering
indicates that the accretion disk remained intact, and that the increase in optical brightness
was due to an increase in the rate of accretion through the disk. The stability of all these properties
in 2016 stands in marked contrast to dramatic variations during the 1990 optical brightening event
of MWC 560, despite reaching a similar accretion luminosity. We propose that accretion state changes
in MWC 560, such as evacuation of the inner disk, are sometimes prevented by the self-regulatory
effect of the disk's outflow.
