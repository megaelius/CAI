We present a formalism for a first-order estimation of the magnetosphere radius of exoplanets orbiting
stars in the range from 0.08 to 1.3 Mo. With this radius, we estimate the atmospheric surface that
is not protected from stellar winds. We have analyzed this unprotected surface for the most extreme
environment for exoplanets: GKM-type and very low-mass stars at the two limits of the habitable
zone. The estimated unprotected surface makes it possible to define a likelihood for an exoplanet
to retain its atmosphere. This function can be incorporated into the new habitability index SEPHI.
Using different formulations in the literature in addition to stellar and exoplanet physical characteristics,
we estimated the stellar magnetic induction, the main characteristics of the stellar wind, and
the different star-planet interaction regions (sub- and super-Alfv\'enic, sub- and supersonic).
With this information, we can estimate the radius of the exoplanet magnetopause and thus the exoplanet
unprotected surface. We have conducted a study of the auroral aperture angles for Earth-like exoplanets
orbiting the habitable zone of its star, and found different behaviors depending on whether the
star is in rotational saturated or unsaturated regimes, with angles of aperture of the auroral ring
above or below 36^\circ, respectively, and with different slopes for the linear relation between
the auroral aperture angle at the inner edge of the habitable zone versus the difference between
auroral aperture angles at the two boundaries of the habitable zone. When the planet is tidally locked,
the unprotected angle increases dramatically to values higher than 40^\circ with a low likelihood
of keeping its atmosphere. When the impact of stellar wind is produced in the sub-Alfv\'enic regime,
the likelihood of keeping the atmosphere is almost zero for exoplanets orbiting very close to their
star.
