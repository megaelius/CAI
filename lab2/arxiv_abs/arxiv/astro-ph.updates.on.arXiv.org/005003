WISE J080822.18$-$644357.3 was recently identified as a new M dwarf debris disc system and a candidate
member of the 45 Myr-old Carina association. Given that the strength of its infrared excess ($L_{\rm
IR}/L_{\rm \star}\simeq 0.1$) appears to be more consistent with a young protoplanetary disc,
we present the first optical spectra of the star and reassess its evolutionary and membership status.
We find WISE J0808-6443 to be a Li-rich M5 star with strong H$\alpha$ emission ($-125 < \textrm{EW}
< -65$ \AA\ over 4 epochs) whose strength and broad width are consistent with accretion at a low level
($\sim$10$^{-10}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) from its disc. The spectral energy distribution of
the star is consistent with a primordial disc and is well-fit using a two-temperature blackbody
model with $T_{\rm inner}\simeq$ 1100 K and $T_{\rm outer}\simeq$ 240 K. AllWISE multi-epoch photometry
shows the system exhibits significant variability in the 3.4 $\mu$m and 4.6 $\mu$m bands. We calculate
an improved proper motion based on archival astrometry, and combined with a new radial velocity,
the kinematics of the star are consistent with membership in Carina at a kinematic distance of $90\pm9$
pc. The spectroscopic and photometric data are consistent with WISE J0808-6443 being a $\sim$0.1
$M_{\odot}$ Classical T-Tauri star and one of the oldest known accreting M-type stars. These results
provide further evidence that the upper limit on the lifetimes of gas-rich discs - and hence the timescales
to form and evolve protoplanetary systems - around the lowest mass stars may be longer than previously
recognised, or some mechanism may be responsible for regenerating short-lived discs at later stages
of pre-main sequence evolution.
