We present the results of photometric and spectroscopic follow-ups of the lowest mass member candidates
in the nearest OB association, Upper Scorpius (5-10 Myr; 145+/-17 pc), with the Gran Telescopio
de Canarias (GTC) and European Southern Observatory (ESO) Very Large Telescope (VLT). We confirm
the membership of the large majority (>80%) of the candidates selected originally photometrically
and astrometrically based on their spectroscopic features, weak equivalent widths of gravity-sensitive
doublets, and radial velocities. Confirmed members follow a sequence over a wide magnitude range
(J=17.0-19.3 mag) in several colour-magnitude diagrams with optical, near-, and mid-infrared
photometry, and have near-infrared spectral types in the L1-L7 interval with likely masses below
15 Jupiter masses. We find that optical spectral types tend to be earlier than near-infrared spectral
types by a few subclasses for spectral types later than M9. We investigate the behaviour of spectral
indices defined in the literature as a function of spectral type and gravity by comparison with values
reported in the literature for young and old dwarfs. We also derive effective temperatures in the
1900-1600K from fits of synthetic model-atmosphere spectra to the observed photometry but we caution
the procedure carries large uncertainties. We determine bolometric corrections for young L dwarfs
with ages of ~5-10 Myr (Upper Sco association) and find them similar in the J-band but larger by 0.1-0.4
mag in the K-band with respect to field L dwarfs. Finally, we discovered two faint young L dwarfs,
VISTAJ1607-2146 (L4.5) and VISTAJ1611-2215 (L5) that have H$\alpha$ emission and possible flux
excesses at 4.5 microns, pointing towards the presence of accretion from a disk onto the central
objects of mass below ~15 Jupiter masses at the age of 5-10 Myr.
