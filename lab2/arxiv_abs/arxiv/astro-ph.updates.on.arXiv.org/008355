The Upper Scorpius OB association is the nearest region of recent massive star formation and thus
an important benchmark for investigations concerning stellar evolution and planet formation
timescales. We present nine EBs in Upper Scorpius, three of which are newly reported here and all
of which were discovered from K2 photometry. Joint fitting of the eclipse photometry and radial
velocities from newly acquired Keck-I/HIRES spectra yields precise masses and radii for those
systems that are spectroscopically double-lined. The binary orbital periods in our sample range
from 0.6-100 days, with total masses ranging from 0.2-8 $M_\odot$. At least 33% of the EBs reside
in hierarchical multiples, including two triples and one quadruple. We use these EBs to develop
an empirical mass-radius relation for pre-main-sequence stars, and to evaluate the predictions
of widely-used stellar evolutionary models. We report evidence for an age of 5-7 Myr which is self-consistent
in the mass range of 0.3-5 $M_\odot$ and based on the fundamentally-determined masses and radii
of eclipsing binaries (EBs). Evolutionary models including the effects of magnetic fields imply
an age of 9-10 Myr. Our results are consistent with previous studies that indicate many models systematically
underestimate the masses of low-mass stars by 20-60% based on H-R diagram analyses. We also consider
the dynamical states of several binaries and compare with expectations from tidal dissipation
theories. Finally, we identify RIK 72 b as a long-period transiting brown dwarf ($M = 59.2 \pm 6.8\
M_\mathrm{Jup}$, $R = 3.10 \pm 0.31\ R_\mathrm{Jup}$, $P \approx 97.8$ days) and an ideal benchmark
for brown dwarf cooling models at 5-10 Myr.
