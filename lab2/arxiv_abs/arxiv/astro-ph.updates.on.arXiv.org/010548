The radius $R_{1.4}$ of canonical neutron stars (NSs) has been extracted consistently with about
6-13\% $1\sigma$ statistical and 10\% systematic errors in many recent studies of the tidal deformability
of NSs involved in GW170817 and X-rays from quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries. Using representative
$R_{1.4}$ data in the literature, we infer the high-density nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$
and the associated nucleon specific energy $E_0(\rho)$ in symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) within
a Bayesian statistical approach using an explicitly isospin-dependent parametric Equation of
State (EOS). We find that: (1) The available astrophysical data can already improve significantly
our knowledge about the $E_0(\rho)$ and $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$ in the density range of $\rho_0-2.5\rho_0$
compared to what we currently know. In particular, the symmetry energy at twice the saturation density
$\rho_0$ of nuclear matter is determined to be $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(2\rho_0)$ =39.2$_{-8.2}^{+12.1}$
MeV at 68\% confidence level approximately independent of the EOS parameterizations used. (2)
A precise measurement of $R_{1.4}$ alone with a 4\% 1$\sigma$ statistical error but no systematic
error will not improve much the constraints on the EOS of dense neutron-rich nucleonic matter compared
to those extracted already from using the available radius data. (3) The high-density behavior
of $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$ inferred depends strongly on how the high-density $E_0(\rho)$ is parameterized,
and vice versa. (4) The value of the observed maximum NS mass and whether it is used as a sharp cut-off
for the minimum maximum mass or through a Gaussian distribution in the Bayesian analyses affect
significantly the lower boundaries of $E_0(\rho)$ and $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$ only at densities
higher than about $2.5\rho_0$.
