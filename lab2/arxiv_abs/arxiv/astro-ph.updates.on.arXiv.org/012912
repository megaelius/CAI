Escalating observations of exo-minor planets and their destroyed remnants both passing through
the solar system and within white dwarf planetary systems motivate an understanding of the orbital
history and fate of exo-Kuiper belts and planetesimal discs. Here we explore how the structure of
a 40-1000 au annulus of planetesimals orbiting inside of a solar system analogue that is itself initially
embedded within a stellar cluster environment varies as the star evolves through all of its stellar
phases. We attempt this computationally challenging link in four parts: (1) by performing stellar
cluster simulations lasting 100 Myr, (2) by making assumptions about the subsequent quiescent
11 Gyr main-sequence evolution, (3) by performing simulations throughout the giant branch phases
of evolution, and (4) by making assumptions about the belt's evolution during the white dwarf phase.
Throughout these stages, we estimate the planetesimals' gravitational responses to analogues
of the four solar system giant planets, as well as to collisional grinding, Galactic tides, stellar
flybys, and stellar radiation. We find that the imprint of stellar cluster dynamics on the architecture
of $\gtrsim 100$ km-sized exo-Kuiper belt planetesimals is retained throughout all phases of stellar
evolution unless violent gravitational instabilities are triggered either (1) amongst the giant
planets, or (2) due to a close ($\ll 10^3$ au) stellar flyby. In the absence of these instabilities,
these minor planets simply double their semimajor axis while retaining their primordial post-cluster
eccentricity and inclination distributions, with implications for the free-floating planetesimal
population and metal-polluted white dwarfs.
