We present a new method to detect planetary transits from time-series photometry, the Transit Least
Squares (TLS) algorithm. TLS searches for transit-like features while taking the stellar limb
darkening and planetary ingress and egress into account. We have optimized TLS for both signal detection
efficiency (SDE) of small planets and computational speed. TLS analyses the entire, unbinned phase-folded
light curve. We compensate for the higher computational load by (i.) using algorithms like "Mergesort"
(for the trial orbital phases) and by (ii.) restricting the trial transit durations to a smaller
range that encompasses all known planets, and using stellar density priors where available. A typical
K2 light curve, including 80d of observations at a cadence of 30min, can be searched with TLS in ~10s
real time on a standard laptop computer, as fast as the widely used Box Least Squares (BLS) algorithm.
We perform a transit injection-retrieval experiment of Earth-sized planets around sun-like stars
using synthetic light curves with 110ppm white noise per 30min cadence, corresponding to a photometrically
quiet KP=12 star observed with Kepler. We determine the SDE thresholds for both BLS and TLS to reach
a false positive rate of 1% to be SDE~7 in both cases. The resulting true positive (or recovery) rates
are ~93% for TLS and ~76% for BLS, implying more reliable detections with TLS. We also test TLS with
the K2 light curve of the TRAPPIST-1 system and find six of seven Earth-sized planets using an iterative
search for increasingly lower signal detection efficiency, the phase-folded transit of the seventh
planet being affected by a stellar flare. TLS is more reliable than BLS in finding any kind of transiting
planet but it is particularly suited for the detection of small planets in long time series from Kepler,
TESS, and PLATO. We make our Python implementation of TLS publicly available.
