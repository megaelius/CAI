We present ALMA (0.87~mm) and VLA (9~mm) observations toward OMC2-FIR4 and OMC2-FIR3 within the
Orion integral-shaped filament that are thought to be the nearest regions of intermediate mass
star formation. We characterize the continuum sources within these regions on $\sim$40~AU (0\farcs1)
scales and associated molecular line emission at a factor of $\sim$30 better resolution than previous
observations at similar wavelengths. We identify six compact continuum sources within OMC2-FIR4,
four in OMC2-FIR3, and one additional source just outside OMC2-FIR4. This continuum emission is
tracing the inner envelope and/or disk emission on less than 100~AU scales. HOPS-108 is the only
protostar in OMC2-FIR4 that exhibits emission from high-excitation transitions of complex organic
molecules (e.g., methanol and other lines) coincident with the continuum emission. HOPS-370 in
OMC2-FIR3 with L~$\sim$~360~\lsun, also exhibits emission from high-excitation methanol and
other lines. The methanol emission toward these two protostars is indicative of temperatures high
enough to thermally evaporate methanol from icy dust grains; overall these protostars have characteristics
similar to hot corinos. We do not identify a clear outflow from HOPS-108 in \twco, but find evidence
of interaction between the outflow/jet from HOPS-370 and the OMC2-FIR4 region. The multitude of
observational constraints indicate that HOPS-108 is likely a low to intermediate-mass protostar
in its main mass accretion phase and it is the most luminous protostar in OMC2-FIR4. The high resolution
data presented here are essential for disentangling the embedded protostars from their surrounding
dusty environments and characterizing them.
