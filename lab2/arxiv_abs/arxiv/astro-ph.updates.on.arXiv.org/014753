We present results of analysis of physical conditions (number density, intensity of UV field, kinetic
temperature) in the cold H$_2$-bearing interstellar medium of local and high redshift galaxies.
Our measurements based on the fit to the observed population of H$_2$ rotational levels and CI fine-structure
levels with the help of grids of numerical models calculated with the PDR Meudon code. A joint analysis
of low H$_2$ rotational levels and CI fine-structure levels allows to break the degeneracy in the
$I_{UV}-n_{\rm{H}}$ plane and provides significantly tighter constraints on the number density
and intensity of UV field. Using archive data from the VLT/UVES, KECK/HIRES, HST/STIS and FUSE telescopes
we selected 12 high redshift damped Ly$\alpha$ systems (DLAs) in quasar spectra and 14 H$_2$ absorption
systems along the lines of sight towards stars in the Milky-Way and the Magellanic Clouds galaxies.
These systems have strong H$_2$ components with the column density $\log N({\rm{H_2}})/{\rm{cm}}^{-2}>18$
and associated CI absorptions. We find that H$_2$-bearing medium in high redshift DLAs and in local
galaxies has similar values of the kinetic temperatures $T_{\rm{kin}}\sim100$K and number density
$10-500$ cm$^{-3}$. However, the intensity of incident UV radiation in DLAs is varied in the wide
range ($0.1-100$ units of Mathis field), while it is $\sim0.1-3$ units of Mathis field for H$_2$
systems in Milky-Way and LMC and SMC galaxies. The large dispersion of measured UV flux in DLAs is
probably a consequence that DLA sample probes the galaxies selected from the overall galaxy population
at high-z and therefore corresponds to the wide range of the physical conditions.
