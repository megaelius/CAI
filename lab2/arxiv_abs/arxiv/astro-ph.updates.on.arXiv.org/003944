We present a seismological method to probe the solar atmosphere above sunspot umbrae with three-minute
oscillations. Our technique allows us to estimate both the vertical distance between atmospheric
layers and the wave-propagation speed without specifying any extra parameters, in particular,
the phase speed of the wave or the emission formation heights. Our method uses the projected wave
paths of slow MHD waves propagating through the atmospheric layers of different heights and guided
by the magnetic field. The length of the projected wave path depends upon the distance between the
layers and the inclination angle of the magnetic field with respect to the line of sight, allowing
us to estimate the distance between the layers from measured projected wave paths and the local magnetic-field
vector. In turn, the wave-propagation delay registered at different heights allows for the calculation
of the phase speed. We estimated the vertical distance between the emission layers at the temperature
minimum (1600 {\AA}) and transition region (304 {\AA}), as well as the average phase speed above
the sunspot umbrae, for three active regions. We found that the distance between the 1600 {\AA} emission
layer and the transition region above the sunspot umbrae lies in the range of 500 -- 800 km. The average
phase speed between these layers was found to be about 30 km/s giving the sound speed of 6 km/s. The
temperature between the layers has been roughly estimated as 3000 K and corresponds to the region
of the temperature minimum. The results obtained are consistent with the semiempirical model of
the sunspot umbrae atmosphere by Fontenla, 2009. The manuscript has been accepted for publication
in Solar Physics journal.
