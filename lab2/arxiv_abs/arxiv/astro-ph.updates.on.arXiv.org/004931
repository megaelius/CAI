Einstein originally proposed a nonsymmetric tensor field, with its symmetric part associated
with the spacetime metric and its antisymmetric part associated with the electromagnetic field,
as an approach to a unified field theory. Here we interpret it more modestly as an alternative to Einstein-Maxwell
theory, approximating the coupling between the electromagnetic field and spacetime curvature
in the macroscopic classical regime. Previously it was shown that the Lorentz force can be derived
from this theory, albeit with deviation on the scale of a universal length constant $\ell$. Here
we assume that $\ell$ is of galactic scale and show that the modified coupling of the electromagnetic
field with charged particles allows a non-Maxwellian equilibrium of non-neutral plasma. The resulting
electromagnetic field is "dark" in the sense that its modified Lorentz force on the plasma vanishes,
yet through its modified coupling to the gravitational field it engenders a nonvanishing, effective
mass density. We obtain a solution for which this mass density asymptotes approximately to that
of the pseudo-isothermal model of dark matter. The resulting gravitational field produces radial
acceleration, in the context of a post-Minkowskian approximation, which is negligible at small
radius but yields a flat rotation curve at large radius. We further exhibit a family of such solutions
which, like the pseudo-isothermal model, has a free parameter to set the mass scale (in this case
related to the charge density) and a free parameter to set the length scale (in this case an integer
multiple of $\ell$). Moreover, these solutions are members of a larger family with more general
angular and radial dependence. They thus show promise as approximations of generalized pseudo-isothermal
models, which in turn are known to fit a wide range of mass density profiles for galaxies and clusters.
