[Abridged] A key hypothesis in the field of exoplanet atmospheres is the trend of atmospheric thermal
structure with planetary equilibrium temperature. We explore this trend and report here the first
statistical detection of a transition in the near-infrared (NIR) atmospheric emission between
hot and ultra-hot Jupiters. We measure this transition using secondary eclipse observations and
interpret this phenomenon as changes in atmospheric properties, and more specifically in terms
of transition from non-inverted to inverted thermal profiles. We examine a sample of 78 hot Jupiters
with secondary eclipse measurements at 3.6 {\mu}m and 4.5 {\mu}m measured with Spitzer Infrared
Array Camera (IRAC). We measure the deviation of the data from the blackbody, which we define as the
difference between the observed 4.5 {\mu}m eclipse depth and that expected at this wavelength based
on the brightness temperature measured at 3.6 {\mu}m. We study how the deviation between 3.6 and
4.5 {\mu}m changes with theoretical predictions with equilibrium temperature and incoming stellar
irradiation. We reveal a clear transition in the observed emission spectra of the hot Jupiter population
at 1660 +/- 100 K in the zero albedo, full redistribution equilibrium temperature. We find the hotter
exoplanets have even hotter daysides at 4.5 {\mu}m compared to 3.6 {\mu}m, which manifests as an
exponential increase in the emitted power of the planets with stellar insolation. We propose that
the measured transition is a result of seeing carbon monoxide in emission due to the formation of
temperature inversions in the atmospheres of the hottest planets. These thermal inversions could
be caused by the presence of atomic and molecular species with high opacities in the optical and/or
the lack of cooling species. We find that the population of hot Jupiters statistically disfavors
high C/O planets (C/O>= 0.85).
