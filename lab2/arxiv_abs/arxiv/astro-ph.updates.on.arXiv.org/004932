TIFR Near Infrared Imaging Camera-II is a closed-cycle Helium cryo-cooled imaging camera equipped
with a Raytheon 512 x 512 pixels InSb Aladdin III Quadrant focal plane array having sensitivity to
photons in the 1-5 microns wavelength band. In this paper, we present the performance of the camera
on the newly installed 3.6-m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) based on the calibration observations
carried out during 2017 May 11-14 and 2017 October 7-31. After the preliminary characterization,
the camera has been released to the Indian and Belgian astronomical community for science observations
since 2017 May. The camera offers a field-of-view of ~86.5 arcsec x 86.5 arcsec on the DOT with a pixel
scale of 0.169 arcsec. The seeing at the telescope site in the near-infrared bands is typically sub-arcsecond
with the best seeing of ~0.45 arcsec realized in the near-infrared K-band on 2017 October 16. The
camera is found to be capable of deep observations in the J, H and K bands comparable to other 4-m class
telescopes available world-wide. Another highlight of this camera is the observational capability
for sources up to Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) W1-band (3.4 microns) magnitudes
of 9.2 in the narrow L-band (nbL; lambda_{cen} ~3.59 microns). Hence, the camera could be a good complementary
instrument to observe the bright nbL-band sources that are saturated in the Spitzer-Infrared Array
Camera ([3.6] <= 7.92 mag) and the WISE W1-band ([3.4] <= 8.1 mag). Sources with strong polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at 3.3 microns are also detected. Details of the observations
and estimated parameters are presented in this paper.
