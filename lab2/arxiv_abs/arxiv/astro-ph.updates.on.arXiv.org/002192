This study aims to characterise the polarized foreground emission in the ELAIS-N1 field and to address
its possible implications for the extraction of the cosmological 21-cm signal from the Low-Frequency
Array - Epoch of Reionization (LOFAR-EoR) data. We use the high band antennas of LOFAR to image this
region and RM-synthesis to unravel structures of polarized emission at high Galactic latitudes.
The brightness temperature of the detected Galactic emission is on average 4 K in polarized intensity
and covers the range from -10 to +13rad m^-2 in Faraday depth. The total polarized intensity and polarization
angle show a wide range of morphological features. We have also used the Westerbork Synthesis Radio
Telescope (WSRT) at 350 MHz to image the same region. The LOFAR and WSRT images show a similar complex
morphology, at comparable brightness levels, but their spatial correlation is very low. The fractional
polarization at 150 MHz, expressed as a percentage of the total intensity, amounts to 1.5%. There
is no indication of diffuse emission in total intensity in the interferometric data, in line with
results at higher frequencies. The wide frequency range, good angular resolution and good sensitivity
make LOFAR an exquisite instrument for studying Galactic polarized emission at a resolution of
1-2 rad m^-2 in Faraday depth. The different polarised patterns observed at 150 MHz and 350 MHz are
consistent with different source distributions along the line of sight wring in a variety of Faraday
thin regions of emission. The presence of polarised foregrounds is a serious complication for Epoch
of Reionization experiments. To avoid the leakage of polarized emission into total intensity,
which can depend on frequency, we need to calibrate the instrumental polarization across the field
of view to a small fraction of 1%.
