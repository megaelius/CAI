Several interesting Dark Matter (DM) models invoke a dark sector leading to two types of relic particles,
possibly interacting with each other: non-relativistic DM, and relativistic Dark Radiation (DR).
These models have interesting consequences for cosmological observables, and could in principle
solve problems like the small-scale cold DM crisis, Hubble tension, and/or low $\sigma_8$ value.
Their cosmological behaviour is captured by the ETHOS parametrisation, which includes a DR-DM
scattering rate scaling like a power-law of the temperature, $T^n$. Scenarios with $n=0$, $2$,
or $4$ can easily be realised in concrete dark sector set-ups. Here we update constraints on these
three scenarios using recent CMB, BAO, and high-resolution Lyman-$\alpha$ data. We introduce
a new Lyman-$\alpha$ likelihood that is applicable to a wide range of cosmological models with a
suppression of the matter power spectrum on small scales. For $n=2$ and $4$, we find that Lyman-$\alpha$
data strengthen the CMB+BAO bounds on the DM-DR interaction rate by many orders of magnitude. However,
models offering a possible solution to the missing satellite problem are still compatible with
our new bounds. For $n=0$, high-resolution Lyman-$\alpha$ data bring no stronger constraints
on the interaction rate than CMB+BAO data, except for extremely small values of the DR density. Using
CMB+BAO data and a theory-motivated prior on the minimal density of DR, we find that the $n=0$ model
can reduce the Hubble tension from $4.1\sigma$ to $2.7\sigma$, while simultaneously accommodating
smaller values of the $\sigma_8$ and $S_8$ parameters hinted by cosmic shear data.
