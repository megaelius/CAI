The recent simulations showed that the whistler heat flux instability, which presumably produces
the most of quasi-parallel coherent whistler waves in the solar wind, is not efficient in regulating
the electron heat conduction. In addition, recent spacecraft measurements indicated that some
fraction of coherent whistler waves in the solar wind may propagate anti-parallel to the electron
heat flux, being produced due to a perpendicular temperature anisotropy of suprathermal electrons.
We present analysis of properties of parallel and anti-parallel whistler waves unstable at electron
heat fluxes and temperature anisotropies of suprathermal electrons typical of the pristine solar
wind. Assuming the electron population consisting of counter-streaming dense thermal core and
tenuous suprathermal halo populations, we perform a linear stability analysis to demonstrate
that anti-parallel whistler waves are expected to have smaller frequencies, wave numbers and growth
rates compared to parallel whistler waves. The stability analysis is performed over a wide range
of parameters of core and halo electron populations. Using the quasi-linear scaling relation we
show that anti-parallel whistler waves saturate at amplitudes of one order of magnitude smaller
than parallel whistler waves, which is at about $10^{-3}\;B_0$ in the pristine solar wind. The analysis
shows that the presence of anti-parallel whistler waves in the pristine solar wind is more likely
to be obscured by turbulent magnetic field fluctuations, because of lower frequencies and smaller
amplitudes compared to parallel whistler waves. The presented results will be also valuable for
numerical simulations of the electron heat flux regulation in the solar wind.
