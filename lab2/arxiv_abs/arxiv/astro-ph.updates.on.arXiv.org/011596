At a Galactocentric distance of 27 kpc, Pal 13 is an old globular cluster (GC) in the outer halo. We
present a chemical abundance analysis of this remote system from high-resolution spectra obtained
with Keck/HIRES. Owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the data, our analysis is based on a coaddition
of the spectra of 18 member stars. We are able to determine integrated abundance ratios for 16 species
of 14 elements, of $\alpha$-elements (Mg,Si,Ca,Ti), Fe-peak (Sc,Mn,Cr,Ni,Cu,and Zn), and n-capture
elements (Y,Ba). While the mean Na abundance is found to be slightly enhanced and halo-like, our
method does not allow us to probe an abundance spread that would be expected in this light element
if multiple populations are present in Pal 13. We find a metal-poor mean metallicity of $-1.91\pm0.05$
(statistical) $\pm$ 0.22 (systematic), confirming that Pal 13 is a typical metal-poor representative
of the outer halo. While there are some differences between individual $\alpha$-elements, such
as halo-like Mg and Si versus the mildly lower Ca and Ti abundances, the mean [$\alpha$/Fe] of 0.34$\pm$0.06
is consistent with the marginally lower $\alpha$ component of the halo field and GC stars. We discuss
our results in the context of other objects in the outer halo and consider which of these objects were
likely accreted. We also discuss the properties of their progenitors. While chemically, Pal 13
is similar to Gaia-Enceladus and some of its GCs, this is not supported by its kinematic properties.
Moreover, its chemodynamical similarity with NGC 5466, a progeny of the Sequoia accretion event,
might indicate a common origin in this progenitor. However, the ambiguities in the full abundance
space of this comparison emphasize the difficulties in unequivocally labeling a single GC as an
accreted object, let alone assigning it to a single progenitor. (Abridged)
