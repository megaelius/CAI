The clustering of local extrema including peaks and troughs will be exploited to assess Gaussianity,
asymmetry and the footprint of cosmic strings network on the CMB random field observed by {\it Planck}
satellite. The number density of local extrema reveals some non-resolved shot noise in {\it Planck}
maps. The \texttt{SEVEM} data has maximum number density of peaks, $n_{pk}$, and troughs, $n_{tr}$,
compared to other observed maps. The cumulative of $n_{pk}$ and $n_{tr}$ above and below a threshold,
$\vartheta$, for all {\it Planck} maps except for the 100GHz band are compatible with the Gaussian
random field. The unweighted Two-Point Correlation Function (TPCF), $\Psi(\theta;\vartheta)$,
of the local extrema illustrates significant non-Gaussianity for angular separation $\theta\le
15'$ for all available thresholds. Our results show that to put the feasible constraint on the amplitude
of the mass function based on the value of $\Psi$ around the {\it Doppler peak} ($\theta\approx 70'-75'$),
we should consider $\vartheta\gtrsim+1.0$. The scale independent bias factors for peak above
a threshold for large separation angle and high threshold level are in agreement with that of expected
for a pure Gaussian CMB. Unweighted TPCF of local extrema demonstrates a level of rejecting Gaussian
hypothesis in \texttt{SMICA}. Genus topology also confirms the Gaussian hypothesis for different
component separation maps. Tessellating CMB map with disk of size $6^{\circ}$ based on $n_{pk}$
and $\Psi_{pk-pk}$ demonstrate statistical symmetry in {\it Planck} maps. Combining all maps
and applying the $\Psi_{pk-pk}$ puts the upper bound on the cosmic string's tension: $G\mu^{(up)}
\lesssim 5.00\times 10^{-7}$.
