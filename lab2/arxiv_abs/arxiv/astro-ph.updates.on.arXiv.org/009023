The stellar populations in the inner kiloparsecs of the Milky Way (MW) show complex kinematical
and chemical structures. The origin and evolution of these structures is still under debate. Here
we study the central region of a fully cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of a disk galaxy that
reproduces key properties of the inner kiloparsecs of the MW: it has a boxy morphology and shows an
overall rotation and dispersion profile in agreement with observations. We use a clustering algorithm
on stellar kinematics to identify a number of discrete kinematic components: a high- and low-spin
disk, a stellar halo and two bulge components; one fast rotating and one slow-rotating. We focus
on the two bulge components and show that the slow rotating one is spherically symmetric while the
fast rotating component shows a boxy/peanut morphology. Although the two bulge components are
kinematically discrete populations at present-day, they are both mostly formed over similar time
scales, from disk material. We find that stellar particles with lower initial birth angular momentum
(most likely thick disc stars) end up in the slow-rotating low-spin bulge, while stars with higher
birth angular momentum (most likely thin disc stars) are found in the high-spin bulge. This has the
important consequence that a bulge population with a spheroidal morphology does not necessarily
indicate a merger origin. In fact, we do find that only $\sim2.3$\% of the stars in the bulge components
are ex-situ stars brought in by accreted dwarf galaxies early on. We identify these ex-situ stars
as the oldest and most metal-poor stars on highly radial orbits with large vertical excursions from
the disk.
