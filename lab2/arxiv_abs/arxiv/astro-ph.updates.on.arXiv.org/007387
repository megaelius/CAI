Massive stars, supernovae, and kilonovae are among the most luminous radiation sources in the universe.
The powerful radiation from these sources is expected to have significant effects on the physical
and chemical properties of surrounding environments. In this paper, we present a new, efficient
destruction mechanism of large dust grains in strong radiation fields due to extremely fast rotation
by radiative torques, which is termed RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD) mechanism. We show that
the RATD mechanism can destroy large grains located within a distance of $2$ pc from a massive star
and supernova, and within 0.1 pc from a kilonova explosion, resulting in the enhancement of very
small (size $a<0.01\mu$ m) and small dust grains. We find that the RATD mechanism can successfully
explain several puzzles in dust astrophysics, including (i) the anomalous dust extinction towards
SNe Ia, (ii) NIR-MIR emission excess from young massive star clusters, (iii) and Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC)-like extinction curves with a steep far-UV rise in starburst and high redshift galaxies.
The enhancement of small grains by RATD also results in the decrease of the escape fraction of Ly$\alpha$
photons from \ion{H}{2} regions surrounding young massive star clusters. If interstellar grains
are porous/aggregate, the RATD mechanism can also successfully explain the well-known lack of
grains larger than $\sim 0.25\mu m$ in the diffuse interstellar medium of our galaxy. Modeling of
dust evolution, dust emission, and polarization from intense radiation environments should account
for the role of dust destruction by the RATD mechanism.
