High-energy {\gamma}-rays, which are produced by powerful relativistic jets, are usually associated
with blazars and radio galaxies. In the current active galactic nuclei (AGN) paradigm, such jets
are almost exclusively launched from massive elliptical galaxies. Recently, however, Fermi/LAT
detected {\gamma}-rays from a few narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies and thus confirmed the presence
of relativistic jets in them. Since NLS1 galaxies are assumed to be young evolving AGN, they offer
a unique opportunity to study the production of relativistic jets in late-type galaxies. Our aim
is to estimate by which processes the emission of various kinds is produced in NLS1 galaxies and to
study how emission properties are connected to other intrinsic AGN properties. We have compiled
the so far largest multiwavelength database of NLS1 sources. This allowed us to explore correlations
between different wavebands and source properties using, for example, Pearson and Spearman correlations
and principal component analysis. We did this separately for radio-loud and radio-quiet sources.
Multiwavelength correlations suggest that radio-loud sources host relativistic jets that are
the predominant sources of radio, optical, and X-ray emission. The origin of infrared emission
remains unclear. Radio-quiet sources do not host a jet, or the jet is very weak. In them, radio and
infrared emission is more likely generated via star formation processes, and the optical and X-ray
emission originate in the inner parts of the AGN. We also find that the black hole mass correlates
significantly with radio loudness, which suggests that NLS1 galaxies with more massive black holes
are more likely to be able to launch powerful relativistic jets.
