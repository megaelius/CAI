The distribution of the inner orbital periods of solar-type main-sequence (MS) triple star systems
is known to be peaked at a few days, and this has been attributed to tidal evolution combined with eccentricity
excitation due to Lidov-Kozai oscillations. Solar-type MS quadruple star systems also show peaks
in their inner orbital period distributions at a few days. Here, we investigate the natural question
whether tidal evolution combined with secular evolution can explain the observed inner orbital
period distributions in quadruple stars. We carry out population synthesis simulations of solar-type
MS quadruple star systems in both the 2+2 (two binaries orbiting each other's barycentre) and 3+1
(triple orbited by a fourth star) configurations. We take into account secular gravitational and
tidal evolution, and the effects of passing stars. We assume that no short-period systems are formed
initially, and truncate the initial orbital period distributions below 10 d accordingly. We find
that, due to secular and tidal evolution, the inner orbital period distributions develop tails
at short periods. Although qualitatively consistent with the observations, we find that our simulated
orbital period distributions only quantitatively agree with the observations for the 3+1 systems.
The observed 2+2 systems, on the other hand, show an enhancement of systems around 10 d, which is not
reproduced in the simulations. This suggests that the inner orbital periods of 2+2 systems are not
predominantly shaped by tidal and secular evolution, but by other processes, most likely occurring
during the stellar formation and early evolution.
