For a decade now, evidence has accumulated that giant molecular clouds located within the central
molecular zone of our Galaxy reflect X-rays coming from past outbursts of the supermassive black
hole Sgr A*. However, the number of illuminating events as well as their ages and durations are still
unresolved questions. We aim to reconstruct parts of the history of Sgr A* by studying this reflection
phenomenon in the molecular complex Sgr C and by determining the line-of-sight positions of its
main bright substructures. Using observations made with XMM-Newton and Chandra between 2000 and
2014, we investigated the variability of the reflected emission. We carried out an imaging and a
spectral analysis. We also used a Monte Carlo model of the reflected spectra to constrain the line-of-sight
positions of the brightest clumps, and hence to assign an approximate date to the associated illuminating
events. We show that the emission from Sgr C exhibits significant variability in both space and time,
which confirms its reflection origin. The most likely illuminating source is Sgr A*. We report two
distinct variability timescales, as one clump undergoes a sudden rise and fall in about 2005, while
two others vary smoothly throughout the whole 2000-2014 period. By fitting the Monte Carlo model
to the data, we are able to place tight constraints on the 3D positions of the clumps. These two independent
approaches provide a consistent picture of the past activity of Sgr A*, since the two slowly varying
clumps are located on the same wavefront, while the rapidly varying clump corresponds to a different
wavefront, that is, to a different illuminating event. We show that Sgr A* experienced at least two
powerful outbursts in the past 300 years, and for the first time, we provide an estimation of their
age. Extending this approach to other molecular complexes will allow this scenario to be tested
further.
