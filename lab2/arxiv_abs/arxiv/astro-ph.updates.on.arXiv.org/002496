We present a high-precision mass model of galaxy cluster Abell 2744, based on a strong-gravitational-lensing
analysis of the Hubble Space Telescope Frontier Fields (HFF) imaging data, which now include both
Advanced Camera for Surveys and Wide-Field Camera 3 observations to the final depth. Taking advantage
of the unprecedented depth of the visible and near-infrared data, we identify 33 new multiply imaged
galaxies, bringing the total to 51, comprising 159 individual lensed images. In the process, we
correct previous erroneous identifications and positions of multiple systems in the northern
part of the cluster core. With the Lenstool software and the new sets of multiple images, we model
the cluster using two cluster-scale dark matter halos plus galaxy-scale halos for the cluster members.
Our best-fit model predicts image positions with an RMS error of 0.69'', which constitutes an improvement
by almost a factor of two over previous parametric models of this cluster. We measure the total projected
mass inside a 200~kpc aperture as ($2.156\pm 0.003$)$\times 10^{14}M_{\odot}$, thus reaching
1% level precision for the second time, following the recent HFF measurement of MACSJ0416.1-2403.
Importantly, the higher quality of the mass model translates into an overall improvement by a factor
of 4 of the derived magnification factor for the high-redshift lensed background galaxies. Together
with our previous HFF gravitational lensing analysis, this work demonstrates that the HFF data
enables high-precision mass measurements for massive galaxy clusters and the derivation of robust
magnification maps to probe the early Universe.
