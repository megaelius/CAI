We study an eruptive X1.1 circular-ribbon flare on 2013 November 10, combining multiwavelength
observations with a coronal field reconstruction using a non-force-free field method. In the first
stage, a filament forms via magnetic reconnection between two mildly twisted sheared arcades,
which are embedded under the fan dome associated with a null point. This reconnection seems to be
driven by photospheric shearing and converging flows around the inner two arcade footpoints, consistent
with the flare-related changes of transverse field. The southern portion of the filament rises
upward due to torus instability and pushes against the null point. The induced null point reconnection
then generates the circular ribbon and the initial remote brightening in the west, as accelerated
electrons precipitate along the fan and propagate outward along quasi-separatix surfaces with
high values of the squashing factor (Q) in the envelope fields, which have a curtain-like shape here.
In the second stage, the southern end of the flux rope breaks away from the surface, sequentially
disrupts the dome and overlying fields, and erupts in a whipping-like fashion to become a partial
halo coronal mass ejection. This leads to an enhanced flare emission and fast-moving remote brightenings
at the footpoints of the magnetic curtain, which span a remarkably broad region and are also associated
with coronal dimmings. This is a rare example of eruptive circular-ribbon flares, in which the evolution
of a flux rope from its formation to successful eruption out of the dome and the resulting unusually
extended remote brightenings are completely observed.
