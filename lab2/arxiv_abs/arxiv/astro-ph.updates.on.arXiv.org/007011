Fitting equilibrium dynamical models to observational data is an essential step in understanding
the structure of the gaseous hot haloes that surround our own and other galaxies. However, the two
main categories of models that are used in the literature are poorly suited for this task: (i) simple
barotropic models are analytic and can therefore be adjusted to match the observations, but are
clearly unrealistic because the rotational velocity $v_\phi(R,z)$ does not depend on the distance
$z$ from the galactic plane, while (ii) models obtained as a result of cosmological galaxy formation
simulations are more realistic, but are impractical to fit to observations due to high computational
cost. Here we bridge this gap by presenting a general method to construct axisymmetric baroclinic
equilibrium models of rotating galactic coronae in arbitrary external potentials. We consider
in particular a family of models whose equipressure surfaces in the $(R,z)$ plane are ellipses of
varying axis ratio. These models are defined by two one-dimensional functions, the axial ratio
of pressure $q_{\rm axis}(z)$ and the value of the pressure $P_{\rm axis}(z)$ along the galaxy's
symmetry axis. These models can have a rotation speed $v_\phi(R,z)$ that realistically decreases
as one moves away from the galactic plane, and can reproduce the angular momentum distribution found
in cosmological simulations. The models are computationally cheap to construct and can thus be
used in fitting algorithms. We provide a python code that given $q_{\rm axis}(z)$, $P_{\rm axis}(z)$
and $\Phi(R,z)$ returns $\rho(R,z)$, $T(R,z)$, $P(R,z)$, $v_\phi(R,z)$. We show a few examples
of these models using the Milky Way as a case study.
