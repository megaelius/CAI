Context: The interstellar medium (ISM) on all scales is full of structures that can be used as tracers
of processes that feed turbulence. Aims: We used HI survey data to derive global properties of the
angular power distribution of the local ISM. Methods: HI4PI observations on an nside = 1024 HEALPix
grid and Gaussian components representing three phases, the cold, warm, and unstable lukewarm
neutral medium (CNM, WNM, and LNM), were used for velocities $|v_{\mathrm{LSR}}| \leq 25$ \kms.
For high latitudes $|b| > 20\deg$ we generated apodized maps. After beam deconvolution we fitted
angular power spectra. Results: Power spectra for observed column densities are exceptionally
well defined and straight in log-log presentation with 3D power law indices $\gamma \geq -3$ for
the local gas. For intermediate velocity clouds (IVCs) we derive $\gamma = -2.6$ and for high velocity
clouds (HVCs) $\gamma = -2.0$. Single-phase power distributions for the CNM, LNM, and WNM are highly
correlated and shallow with $ \gamma \sim -2.5$ for multipoles $l \leq 100$. Excess power from cold
filamentary structures is observed at larger multipoles. The steepest single-channel power spectra
for the CNM are found at velocities with large CNM and low WNM phase fractions. Conclusions: The phase
space distribution in the local ISM is configured by phase transitions and needs to be described
with three distinct different phases, being highly correlated but having distributions with different
properties. Phase transitions cause locally hierarchical structures in phase space. The CNM is
structured on small scales and is restricted in position-velocity space. The LNM as an interface
to the WNM envelops the CNM. It extends to larger scales than the CNM and covers a wider range of velocities.
Correlations between the phases are self-similar in velocity.
