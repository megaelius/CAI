We report on a statistical study of prominence eruptions (PEs) using a catalog of these events routinely
imaged by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
in the 304 \r{A} pass band. Using an algorithm developed as part of an LWS project, we have detected
PEs in 304 \r{A} synoptic images with 2-min cadence since May 2010. A catalog of these PEs is made available
online (https://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME_list/autope/). The 304 \r{A} images are polar-transformed
and divided by a background map (pixels with minimum intensity during one day) to get the ratio maps
above the limb. The prominence regions are defined as pixels with a ratio $\ge$2. Two prominence
regions with more than 50% of pixels overlapping are considered the same prominence. If the height
of a prominence increases monotonically in 5 successive images, it is considered eruptive. All
the PEs seen above the limb are detected by the routine, but only PEs with width $\ge$15{\deg} are
included in the catalog to eliminate polar jets and other small-scale mass motions. The identifications
are also cross-checked with the PEs identified in Nobeyama Radioheliograph images (this http URL).
The catalog gives the date, time, central position angle, latitude, and width of the eruptive prominence.
The catalog also provides links to JavaScript movies that combine SDO/AIA images with GOES soft
X-ray data to identify the associated flares, and with SOHO/LASCO C2 images to identify the associated
coronal mass ejections. We examined the statistical properties of the PEs and found that the high-latitude
PE speed decreased with the decreasing of the average polar magnetic field strength of the previous
cycle.
