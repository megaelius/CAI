We extend the non-equilibrium model for the chemical and thermal evolution of diffuse interstellar
gas presented in Richings et al. (2014) to account for shielding from the UV radiation field. We attenuate
the photochemical rates by dust and by the gas itself, including absorption by HI, H2, HeI, HeII and
CO where appropriate. We then use this model to investigate the dominant cooling and heating processes
in interstellar gas as it becomes shielded from the UV radiation. We consider a one-dimensional
plane-parallel slab of gas irradiated by the interstellar radiation field, either at constant
density and temperature or in thermal and pressure equilibrium. The dominant thermal processes
tend to form three distinct regions in the clouds. At low column densities cooling is dominated by
ionised metals such as SiII, FeII, FeIII and CII, which are balanced by photoheating, primarily
from HI. Once the hydrogen-ionising radiation becomes attenuated by neutral hydrogen, photoelectric
dust heating dominates, while CII becomes dominant for cooling. Finally, dust shielding triggers
the formation of CO and suppresses photoelectric heating. The dominant coolants in this fully shielded
region are H2 and CO. We find that the transition from atomic to molecular hydrogen is triggered by
H2 self-shielding. The transition column density is lower at higher density (or at higher pressure
for gas clouds in pressure equilibrium) and at higher metallicity, due to an increase in the H2 fraction
in the photodissociated region and hence a corresponding increase in the H2 self-shielding. We
also compare the HI-H2 transition in our model to two prescriptions for molecular hydrogen formation
that have been implemented in hydrodynamic simulations.
