We analyze radial stellar metallicity and kinematic profiles out to 1Re in 244 CALIFA galaxies ranging
from morphological type E to Sd, to study the evolutionary mechanisms of stellar population gradients.
We find that linear metallicity gradients exhibit a clear correlation with galaxy morphological
type - with early type galaxies showing the steepest gradients. We show that the metallicity gradients
simply reflect the local mass-metallicity relation within a galaxy. This suggests that the radial
stellar population distribution within a galaxys effective radius is primarily a result of the
\emph{in-situ} local star formation history. In this simple picture, the dynamically derived
stellar surface mass density gradient directly predicts the metallicity gradient of a galaxy.
We show that this correlation and its scatter can be reproduced entirely by using independent empirical
galaxy structural and chemical scaling relations. Using Schwarzschild dynamical models, we also
explore the link between a galaxys local stellar populations and their orbital structures. We find
that galaxies angular momentum and metallicity gradients show no obvious causal link. This suggests
that metallicity gradients in the inner disk are not strongly shaped by radial migration, which
is confirmed by the lack of correlation between the metallicity gradients and observable probes
of radial migration in the galaxies, such as bars and spiral arms. Finally, we find that galaxies
with positive metallicity gradients become increasingly common towards low mass and late morphological
types - consistent with stellar feedback more efficiently modifying the baryon cycle in the central
regions of these galaxies.
