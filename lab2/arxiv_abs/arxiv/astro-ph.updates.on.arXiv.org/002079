Herschel Space Observatory photometry and extensive multiwavelength followup have revealed
that the powerful radio galaxy 3C 220.3 at z=0.685 acts as a gravitational lens for a background submillimeter
galaxy (SMG) at z=2.221. At an observed wavelength of 1mm, the SMG is lensed into three distinct images.
In the observed near infrared, these images are connected by an arc of 1.8" radius forming an Einstein
half-ring centered near the radio galaxy. In visible light, only the arc is apparent. 3C 220.3 is
the only known instance of strong galaxy-scale lensing by a powerful radio galaxy not located in
a galaxy cluster and therefore it offers the potential to probe the dark matter content of the radio
galaxy host. Lens modeling rejects a single lens, but two lenses centered on the radio galaxy host
A and a companion B, separated by 1.5", provide a fit consistent with all data and reveal faint candidates
for the predicted fourth and fifth images. The model does not require an extended common dark matter
halo, consistent with the absence of extended bright X-ray emission on our Chandra image. The projected
dark matter fractions within the Einstein radii of A (1.02") and B (0.61") are about 0.4 +/- 0.3 and
0.55 +/- 0.3. The mass to i-band light ratios of A and B, M/L ~ 8 +/- 4 Msun/Lsun, appear comparable to
those of radio-quiet lensing galaxies at the same redshift in the CASTLES, LSD, and SL2S samples.
The lensed SMG is extremely bright with observed f(250um) = 440mJy owing to a magnification factor
mu~10. The SMG spectrum shows luminous, narrow CIV 154.9nm emission, revealing that the SMG houses
a hidden quasar in addition to a violent starburst. Multicolor image reconstruction of the SMG indicates
a bipolar morphology of the emitted ultraviolet (UV) light suggestive of cones through which UV
light escapes a dust-enshrouded nucleus.
