LIGO-Virgo and Fermi collaborations recently reported a possible joint detection of a sub-threshold
GW event and a sub-threshold GRB, GBM-190816, that occurred 1.57 s after the merger. Since it takes
long for the official LIGO-Virgo/Fermi Collaboration's results to be released, we decide to independently
process the publicly available data and investigate the physical implications of this potential
association. We perform a detailed analysis of the observational properties of the GBM-190816.
By studying its signal-to-noise ratio, duration, f-parameter, spectral properties, energetic
properties, and its compliance with some GRB statistical correlations, we confirm that this event
is likely a typical short GRB with a luminosity of $1.02_{-0.80}^{+2.84} \times 10^{49} erg s^{-1}$.
Based on the available information, we infer the mass ratio, $q$, of the binary compact stars in the
range of $\sim$ [2.142, 5.795]. The leading physical scenario invokes an NS-BH merger system with
the NS tidally disrupted. We derive the physical properties of such a system that are required to
produce a GRB. The GW data in principle allow NS-BH systems with no tidal disruptio or BH-BH mergers.
The generation of a GRB in these systems requires that at least one of the merger member is charged.
We apply the charged compact binary coalescence (cCBC) theory to derive the model parameters to
account for GBM-190816. The cases for both constant and increasing charges in the merging members
are discussed. Finally, since in NS-BH or BH-BH merger systems a BH exists immediately after the
merger so that there is no waiting time before launching a jet, the fact that the observed delay time
scale is comparable to that of the NS-NS merger event GW170817/GRB 170817A suggests that the commonly
observed GW-GRB time delay is mainly defined by the time scale for the jet propagates to the energy
dissipation / GRB emission site.
