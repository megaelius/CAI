Oscillation modes with a mixed character, as observed in evolved low-mass stars, are highly sensitive
to the physical properties of the innermost regions. Measuring their properties is therefore extremely
important to probe the core, but requires some care, due to the complexity of the mixed-mode pattern.
This work aims at providing a consistent description of the mixed-mode pattern of low-mass stars,
based on the asymptotic expansion. We also aim at studying the variation of the gravity offset $\varepsilon_{g}$
with stellar evolution. We revisit previous work about mixed modes in red giants and empirically
test how period spacings, rotational splittings, mixed-mode widths and heights can be estimated
in a consistent view, based on the properties of the mode inertia ratios. From the asymptotic fit
of the mixed-mode pattern of a large set of red giants at various evolutionary stages, we derive unbiased
and precise asymptotic parameters. As the asymptotic expansion of gravity modes is verified with
a precision close to the frequency resolution for stars on the red giant branch (10$^{-4}$ in relative
values), we can derive accurate values of the asymptotic parameters. We decipher the complex pattern
in a rapidly rotating star, and explain how asymmetrical splittings can be inferred, as well as the
stellar inclinations. This allows us to revisit the stellar inclinations in two open clusters,
NGC 6819 and NGC 6791: our results show that the stellar inclinations in these clusters do not have
privileged orientation in the sky. The variation of the asymptotic gravity offset along with stellar
evolution is investigated in detail. We also derive generic properties that explain under which
conditions mixed modes can be observed.
