Feedback by active galactic nuclei (AGN) appears to be critical in balancing radiative cooling
of the low-entropy gas at the centers of galaxy clusters and in mitigating the star formation of elliptical
galaxies. New observations of M87 enable us to put forward a comprehensive model for the physical
heating mechanism. Low-frequency radio observations by LOFAR revealed the absence of fossil cosmic
ray (CR) electrons in the radio halo surrounding M87. This puzzle can be resolved by accounting for
the CR release from the radio cocoons and the subsequent mixing of CRs with the dense ambient intracluster
gas, which thermalizes the electrons on a timescale similar to the radio halo age of 40 Myrs. Hadronic
interactions of similarly injected CR protons with the ambient gas should produce an observable
gamma-ray signal in accordance with the steady emission of the low state of M87 detected by Fermi
and H.E.S.S. Hence, we normalize the CR population to the gamma-ray emission, which shows the same
spectral slope as the CR injection spectrum probed by LOFAR, thereby supporting a common origin.
We show that CRs, which stream at the Alfven velocity with respect to the plasma rest frame, heat the
surrounding thermal plasma at a rate that balances that of radiative cooling on average at each radius
- thereby setting the thermal pressure profile equal to that of the streaming CRs. However, the resulting
global thermal equilibrium is locally unstable and allows for the formation of the observed cooling
multi-phase medium through thermal instability. Provided CR heating balances cooling during
the emerging "cooling flow", the collapse of the majority of the gas is halted at 1 keV, which is in
accordance with x-ray data. We show that both the existence of a temperature floor and the similar
radial scaling of the heating and cooling rates are generic predictions of the CR heating model.
