The study of accurate methods to estimate the distribution of stellar rotational velocities is
important for understanding many aspects of stellar evolution. From such observations we obtain
the projected rotational speed v sin(i) in order to recover the true distribution of the rotational
velocity. To that end, we need to solve a difficult inverse problem that can be posed as a Fredholm
integral of the first kind. n this work we have used a novel approach based on Maximum likelihood (ML)
estimation to obtain an approximation of the true rotational velocity probability density function
expressed as a sum of known distribution families. In our proposal, the measurements have been treated
as random variables drawn from the projected rotational velocity probability density function.
We analyzed the case of Maxwellian sum approximation, where we estimated the parameters that define
the sum of distributions. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed using Monte Carlo simulations
considering two theoretical cases for the probability density function of the true rotational
stellar velocities: i) an unimodal Maxwellian probability density distribution and ii) a bimodal
Maxwellian probability density distribution. The results show that the proposed method yielded
more accurate estimates in comparison with the Tikhonov regularization method, especially for
small sample length N=50. Our proposal was evaluated using real data from three sets of measurements,
and our findings were validated using three statistical tests. The ML approach with Maxwellian
sum approximation is a accurate method to deconvolve the rotational velocity probability density
function, even when the sample length is small (N= 50)
