We report the latest view of Kepler solar-type (G-type main-sequence) superflare stars, including
recent updates with Apache Point Observatory (APO) 3.5m telescope spectroscopic observations
and Gaia-DR2 data. First, we newly conducted APO3.5m spectroscopic observations of 18 superflare
stars found from Kepler 1-min time cadence data. More than half (43 stars) are confirmed to be "single"
stars, among 64 superflare stars in total that have been spectroscopically investigated so far
in this APO3.5m and our previous Subaru/HDS observations. The measurements of $v\sin i$ (projected
rotational velocity) and chromospheric lines (Ca II H\&K and Ca II 8542\AA) support the brightness
variation of superflare stars is caused by the rotation of a star with large starspots. We then investigated
the statistical properties of Kepler solar-type superflare stars by incorporating Gaia-DR2 stellar
radius estimates. As a result, the maximum superflare energy continuously decreases as the rotation
period $P_{\mathrm{rot}}$ increases. Superflares with energies $\lesssim 5\times10^{34}$
erg occur on old, slowly-rotating Sun-like stars ($P_{\mathrm{rot}}\sim$25 days) approximately
once every 2000--3000 years, while young rapidly-rotating stars with $P_{\mathrm{rot}}\sim$
a few days have superflares up to $10^{36}$ erg. The maximum starspot area does not depend on the rotation
period when the star is young, but as the rotation slows down, it starts to steeply decrease at $P_{\mathrm{rot}}\gtrsim$12
days for Sun-like stars. These two decreasing trends are consistent since the magnetic energy stored
around starspots explains the flare energy, but other factors like spot magnetic structure should
also be considered.
