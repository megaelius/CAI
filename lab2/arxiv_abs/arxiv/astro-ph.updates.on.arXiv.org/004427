The Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer (MinXSS) CubeSat is the first solar science oriented CubeSat
mission flown for the NASA Science Mission Directorate, with the main objective of measuring the
solar soft X-ray (SXR) flux and a science goal of determining its influence on Earth's ionosphere
and thermosphere. These observations can also be used to investigate solar quiescent, active region,
and flare properties. The MinXSS X-ray instruments consist of a spectrometer, called X123, with
a nominal 0.15 keV full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) resolution at 5.9 keV and a broadband X-ray photometer,
called XP. Both instruments are designed to obtain measurements from 0.5 - 30 keV at a nominal time
cadence of 10 seconds. A description of the MinXSS instruments, performance capabilities, and
relation to the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) 0.1 - 0.8 nm flux are
discussed in this article. Early MinXSS results demonstrate the capability to measure variations
of the solar spectral SXR flux between 0.8 - 12 keV from at least GOES A5 - M5 (5 $\times$ 10$^{-8}$ -
5 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ W m$^{-2}$) levels and infer physical properties (temperature and emission
measure) from the MinXSS data alone. Moreover, coronal elemental abundances can be inferred, specifically
Fe, Ca, Si, Mg, S, Ar, and Ni, when there is sufficiently high count rate at each elemental spectral
feature. Additionally, temperature response curves and emission measure loci demonstrate the
MinXSS sensitivity to plasma emission at different temperatures. MinXSS observations coupled
with those from other solar observatories can help address some of the most compelling questions
in solar coronal physics. Finally, simultaneous observations by MinXSS and Reuven Ramaty High
Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) can provide the most spectrally complete soft X-ray
solar flare photon flux measurements to date.
