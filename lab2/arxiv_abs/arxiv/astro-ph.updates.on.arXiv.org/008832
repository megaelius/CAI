Stars which start their lives with spectral types O and early-B are the progenitors of core-collapse
supernovae, long gamma-ray bursts, neutron stars, and black holes. These massive stars are the
primary sources of stellar feedback in star-forming galaxies. At low metallicities, the properties
of massive stars and their evolution are not yet fully explored. Here we report a spectroscopic study
of 320 OB stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The data, which we obtained with the ESO Very Large Telescope,
were analyzed using state-of-the-art stellar atmosphere models. We find that the stellar winds
of our sample stars are much weaker than theoretically expected. The stellar rotation rates show
a bi-modal distribution. We determine the fundamental stellar parameters and build up an empiric
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Our results show indications for a dichotomy in the evolution of
metal-poor single massive stars. With initial masses less than 30 solar masses, they become red
supergiants and likely end up as type II-P supernovae. The more massive stars, however, appear to
evolve quasi chemically-homogeneously and are expected to finally collapse to relatively massive
black holes. We find no empirical evidence for any correlation between stellar rotation and chemically
homogeneous evolution of massive stars. The apparent dichotomy in evolutionary paths is found
to be independent of stellar surface rotation. We report extended star-formation episodes in a
quiescent low-density region of the Wing, which is progressing stochastically. We measure the
key parameters of stellar feedback and establish the links between stellar feedback parameters
and the rates of star formation and supernovae. Our study demonstrates that in metal-poor environments
the stellar feedback is dominated by core-collapse supernovae in combination with winds and ionizing
radiation supplied by a few of the most massive stars.
