In this paper, we show how it is possible to understand Fourier-based Wave Front Sensors (WFS) as
Linear Integral Operators. Indeed optical laws allow to identify quantities called "Kernels"
which are the continuous version of well-known interaction matrices used in Adaptive Optics. The
main purpose of this article is to understand the dependence of these Kernels regarding to the optical
parameters of the WFSs: the entrance pupil geometry, the filtering mask and the tip/tilt modulation.
Kernels are then linked to the classical performance criterion which is the sensitivity. This approach
also allows to take into account time-varying phase residuals. As it turns out, they have physically
the same status as the modulation: they are both "pupil plane light shaping". The only significant
difference is their time-dependent behaviour. Modulation is highly regular and set by the experimenter
while phase residuals are erratic and inevitable. Fortunately, the latter may be described thanks
to their statistics, namely their "structure function" which naturally arises in the Kernel framework.
These results are essential to tackle the Pyramid Wave Front Sensor's optical gain problem which
is at the present time the major factor which constrains the Pyramid WFS performance and operability.
A second part focuses on the special case of "convolutional Kernels". They drastically simplify
the mathematical formulation since the WFS's input and output are linked by a convolution product.
Such a formalism firstly provides a fast diagnostic tool to study Fourier-based WFSs but also suggests
natural algorithms to reconstruct the phase, e.g. Wigner deconvolution. We pay special attention
to the assumptions required to be in such a regime (which does not apply in general). Fortunately,
we show that a wise choice of the modulation allows to improve its validity.
