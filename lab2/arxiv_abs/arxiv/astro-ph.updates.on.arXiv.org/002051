The standard disc formation scenario postulates that disc forms as the gas cools and flows into the
centre of the dark matter halo, conserving the specific angular momentum. Major mergers have been
shown to be able to destroy or highly perturb the disc components. More recently, the alignment of
the material that is accreted to form the galaxy has been pointed out as a key ingredient to determine
galaxy morphology. However, in a hierarchical scenario galaxy formation is a complex process that
combines these processes and others in a non-linear way so that the origin of galaxy morphology remains
to be fully understood. We aim at exploring the differences in the formation histories of galaxies
with a variety of morphology, but quite recent merger histories, to identify which mechanisms are
playing a major role. We analyse when minor mergers can be considered relevant to determine galaxy
morphology. We also study the specific angular momentum content of the disc and central spheroidal
components separately. We used cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that include an effective,
physically motivated supernova feedback that is able to regulate the star formation in haloes of
different masses. We analysed the morphology and formation history of a sample of 15 galaxies of
a cosmological simulation. We performed a spheroid-disc decomposition of the selected galaxies
and their progenitor systems. The angular momentum orientation of the merging systems as well as
their relative masses were estimated to analyse the role played by orientation and by minor mergers
in the determination of the morphology. We found the discs to be formed by conserving the specific
angular momentum in accordance with the classical disc formation model. The specific angular momentum
of the stellar central spheroid correlates with the dark matter halo angular momentum and determines
a power law. Abridged
