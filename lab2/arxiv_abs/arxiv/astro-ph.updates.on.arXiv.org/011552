The DRAO Synthesis Telescope (ST) is a forefront telescope for imaging large-scale neutral hydrogen
and polarized radio continuum emission at arcminute resolution. Equipped for observations at
1420 and 408 MHz, the ST completed the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey, providing pioneering measurements
of arcminute-scale structure in HI emission and self-absorption and of the diffuse polarized emission,
using a fine grid of Rotation Measures to chart the large-scale Galactic magnetic field, and advancing
the knowledge of the Galactic rotation curve. In this paper we describe a plan for renewal of the Synthesis
Telescope that will create a forefront scientific instrument, a testbed for new radio astronomy
technologies, and a training ground for the next generation of Canadian radio astronomers and radio
telescope engineers. The renewed telescope will operate across the entire range 400 to 1800 MHz.
Collaborations between DRAO and university partners have already demonstrated a novel feed antenna
to cover this range, low-noise amplifiers, and a new GPU-based correlator of bandwidth 400 MHz.
The renewed ST will provide excellent sensitivity to extended HI, covering the Galactic disk and
halo, spectro-polarimetry with unprecedented resolution in angle and in Faraday depth, the ability
to search for OH masers in all four 18-cm lines simultaneously, and sensitive recombination-line
observations stacked over as many as forty transitions. As a testbed the renewed ST will evaluate
low-cost digital clocking and sampling techniques of wide significance for the ngVLA, SKA, and
other future telescopes, and a prototype of the digital correlator developed at DRAO for SKA-mid.
