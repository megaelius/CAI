We present results of the classification of cloud structures toward the Orion A Giant Molecular
Cloud based on wide-field $^{12}$CO ($J$ = 1--0), $^{13}$CO ($J$ = 1-0), and C$^{18}$O ($J$ = 1-0)
observations using the Nobeyama 45 m radio telescope. We identified 78 clouds toward Orion A by applying
Spectral Clustering for Interstellar Molecular Emission Segmentation (SCIMES) to the data cube
of the column density of $^{13}$CO. Well-known subregions such as OMC-1, OMC-2/3, OMC-4, OMC-5,
NGC 1977, L1641-N, and the dark lane south filament (DLSF) are naturally identified as distinct
structures in Orion A. These clouds can also be classified into three groups: the integral-shaped
filament, the southern regions of Orion A, and the other filamentary structures in the outer parts
of Orion A and the DLSF. These groups show differences in scaling relations between the physical
properties of the clouds. We derived the abundance ratio between $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O, $X_{^{13}\mathrm{CO}}/X_{\mathrm{C}^{18}\mathrm{O}}$,
which ranges from 5.6 to 17.4 on median over the individual clouds. The significant variation of
$X_{^{13}\mathrm{CO}}/X_{\mathrm{C}^{18}\mathrm{O}}$ is also seen within a cloud in both of
the spatial and velocity directions and the ratio tends to be high at the edge of the cloud. The values
of $X_{^{13}\mathrm{CO}}/X_{\mathrm{C}^{18}\mathrm{O}}$ decrease from 17 to 10 with the median
of the column densities of the clouds at the column density of $N_{\mathrm{C^{18}O}} \gtrsim 1 \times
10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ or visual extinction of $A_V \gtrsim 3$ mag under the strong far-ultraviolet
(FUV) environment of $G_0 > 10^{3}$, whereas it is almost independent of the column density in the
weak FUV radiation field. These results are explained if the selective photodissociation of C$^{18}$O
is enhanced under a strong FUV environment and it is suppressed in the dense part of the clouds.
