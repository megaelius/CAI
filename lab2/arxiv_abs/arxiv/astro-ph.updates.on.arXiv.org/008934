The large-scale overdensities of galaxies at z~2-7 known as protoclusters are believed to be the
sites of cluster formation, and deep, wide survey projects such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
(LSST) and the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) will deliver significant numbers
of these interesting structures. Spectroscopic confirmation and interpretation of these targets,
however, is still challenging, and will require wide-field multi-plexed spectroscopy on >20 m-class
telescopes in the optical and near-infrared. In the coming decade, detailed studies of protoclusters
will enable us, for the first time, to systematically connect these cluster progenitors in the early
universe to their virialized counterparts at lower redshifts. This will allow us to address observationally
the formation of brightest cluster galaxies and other cluster galaxy populations, the buildup
of the intra-cluster light, the chemical enrichment history of the intra-cluster medium, and the
formation and triggering of supermassive black holes in dense environments, all of which are currently
almost exclusively approached either through the fossil record in clusters or through numerical
simulations. Furthermore, at the highest redshifts (z~5-10), these large extended overdensities
of star-forming galaxies are believed to have played an important role in the reionization of the
universe, which needs to be tested by upcoming experiments. Theory and recent simulations also
suggest important links between these overdensities and the formation of supermassive black holes,
but observational evidence is still lacking. In this white paper we review our current understanding
of this important phase of galaxy cluster history that will be explored by the next generation of
large aperture ground-based telescopes GMT and TMT.
