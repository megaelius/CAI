We present the results of a detailed investigation of the prompt and afterglow emission in the HESS
detected GRB 190829A. Swift and Fermi observations of the prompt phase of this GRB reveal two isolated
sub-bursts or episodes, separated by a quiescent phase. The energetic and the spectral properties
of the first episode are in stark contrast to the second. The first episode, which has a higher spectral
peak of $\sim 120\:\text{keV}$ and a low isotropic energy $\sim 10^{50}\:\text{erg}$ is an outlier
to the Amati correlation and marginally satisfies the Yonetoku correlation. However, the energetically
dominant second episode has lower peak energy and is consistent with the above correlations. We
compared this GRB to other low luminosity GRBs (LLGRBs). Prompt emission of LLGRBs also indicates
a relativistic shock breakout origin of the radiation. For GRB 190829A, some of the properties of
a shock breakout origin are satisfied. However, the absence of an accompanying thermal component
and energy above the shock breakout critical limit precludes a shock breakout origin. In the afterglow,
an unusual long-lasting late time flare of duration $\sim 10^4\:\text{s}$ is observed. We also
analyzed the late-time \fermi-LAT emission that encapsulates the H.E.S.S. detection. Some of
the LAT photons are likely to be associated with the source. All the above observational facts suggest
GRB 190829A is a peculiar low luminosity GRB that is not powered by a shock breakout, and with an unusual
rebrightening due to a patchy emission or a refreshed shock during the afterglow. Furthermore,
our results show that TeV energy photons seem common in both high luminosity GRBs and LLGRBs.
