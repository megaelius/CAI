Enhanced angular momentum transfer through the boundary layer near the surface of weakly magnetised
accreting star is required in order to explain the observed accretion timescales in low-mass X-ray
binaries, cataclysmic variables or young stars with massive protoplanetary discs. Accretion
disc boundary layer is locally represented by incompressible homogeneous and boundless flow of
the cyclonic type, which is linearly stable. Its non-linear instability at the shear rates of order
of the rotational frequency remains an issue. We argue that hydrodynamical subcritical turbulence
in such a flow is sustained by the non-linear feedback from essentially three-dimensional vortices,
which are generated by quasi-two-dimensional trailing shearing spirals grown to high amplitude
via the swing amplification. We refer to those three-dimensional vortices as cross-rolls, since
they are aligned in the shearwise direction in contrast to streamwise rolls generated by the anti-lift-up
mechanism in rotating shear flow on the Rayleigh line. Transient growth of cross-rolls is studied
analytically and further confronted with direct numerical simulations (DNS) of dynamics of non-linear
erturbations. DNS performed in a tall box show that transition Reynolds number $R_T$ as function
of shear rate accords with the line of constant maximum transient growth of cross-rolls. The transition
in the tall box has been observed until the shear rate three times higher than the rotational frequency,
when $R_T\sim 50000$. Assuming that the cross-rolls are also responsible for turbulence in the
Keplerian flow, we estimate $R_T\lesssim 10^8$ in this case. The most favourable shear rate to test
the existence of turbulence in the quasi-Keplerian regime may be sub-Keplerian and equal approximately
to $1/2$.
