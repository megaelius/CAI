AGN are known to have complex X-ray spectra that depend on both the properties of the accreting SMBH
(e.g. mass, accretion rate) and the distribution of obscuring material in its vicinity ("torus").
Often however, simple and even unphysical models are adopted to represent the X-ray spectra of AGN.
In the case of blank field surveys in particular, this should have an impact on e.g. the determination
of the AGN luminosity function, the inferred accretion history of the Universe and also on our understanding
of the relation between AGN and their host galaxies. We develop a Bayesian framework for model comparison
and parameter estimation of X-ray spectra. We take into account uncertainties associated with
X-ray data and photometric redshifts. We also demonstrate how Bayesian model comparison can be
used to select among ten different physically motivated X-ray spectral models the one that provides
a better representation of the observations. Despite the use of low-count spectra, our methodology
is able to draw strong inferences on the geometry of the torus. For a sample of 350 AGN in the 4 Ms Chandra
Deep Field South field, our analysis identifies four components needed to represent the diversity
of the observed X-ray spectra: (abridged). Simpler models are ruled out with decisive evidence
in favour of a geometrically extended structure with significant Compton scattering. Regarding
the geometry of the obscurer, there is strong evidence against both a completely closed or entirely
open toroidal geometry, in favour of an intermediate case. The additional Compton reflection required
by data over that predicted by toroidal geometry models, may be a sign of a density gradient in the
torus or reflection off the accretion disk. Finally, we release a catalogue with estimated parameters
such as the accretion luminosity in the 2-10 keV band and the column density, $N_{H}$, of the obscurer.
