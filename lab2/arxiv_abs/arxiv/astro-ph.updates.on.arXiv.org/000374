We aim to better understand the heating of the gas by observing the prominent gas cooling line [CII]
at 158um in the low-metallicity environment of the Local Group spiral galaxy M33 at scales of 280pc.
In particular, we aim at describing the variation of the photoelectric heating efficiency with
galactic environment. In this unbiased study, we used ISO/LWS [CII] observations along the major
axis of M33, in combination with Herschel PACS and SPIRE continuum maps, IRAM 30m CO 2-1 and VLA HI
data to study the variation of velocity integrated intensities. The ratio of [CII] emission over
the far-infrared continuum is used as a proxy for the heating efficiency, and models of photon-dominated
regions are used to study the local physical densities, FUV radiation fields, and average column
densities of the molecular clouds. The heating efficiency stays constant at 0.8% in the inner 4.5kpc
radius of the galaxy where it starts to increase to reach values of ~3% in the outskirts at about 6kpc
radial distance. The rise of efficiency is explained in the framework of PDR models by lowered volume
densities and FUV fields, for optical extinctions of only a few magnitudes at constant metallicity.
In view of the significant fraction of HI emission stemming from PDRs, and for typical pressures
found in the Galactic cold neutral medium (CNM) traced by HI emission, the CNM contributes ~15% to
the observed [CII] emission in the inner 2kpc radius of M33. The CNM contribution remains largely
undetermined in the south, while positions between 2 and 7.3kpc radial distance in the north of M33
show a contribution of ~40%+-20%.
