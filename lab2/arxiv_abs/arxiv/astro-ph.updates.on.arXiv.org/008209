The recent detections of temperate terrestrial planets orbiting nearby stars and the promise of
characterizing their atmospheres motivates a need to understand how the diversity of possible
planetary parameters affects the climate of terrestrial planets. In this work, we investigate
the atmospheric circulation and climate of terrestrial exoplanets orbiting both Sun-like and
M-dwarf stars over a wide swath of possible planetary parameters, including the planetary rotation
period, surface pressure, incident stellar flux, surface gravity, planetary radius, and cloud
particle size. We do so using a general circulation model (GCM) that includes non-grey radiative
transfer and the effects of clouds. The results from this suite of simulations generally show qualitatively
similar dependencies of circulation and climate on planetary parameters as idealized GCMs, with
quantitative differences due to the inclusion of additional model physics. Notably, we find that
the effective cloud particle size is a key unknown parameter that can greatly affect the climate
of terrestrial exoplanets. We confirm a transition between low and high dayside cloud coverage
of synchronously rotating terrestrial planets with increasing rotation period. We determine
that this cloud transition is due to eddy-driven convergence near the substellar point and should
not be parameterization-dependent. Finally, we compute full-phase light curves from our simulations
of planets orbiting M-dwarf stars, finding that changing incident stellar flux and rotation period
affect observable properties of terrestrial exoplanets. Our GCM results can guide expectations
for planetary climate over the broad range of possible terrestrial exoplanets that will be observed
with future space telescopes.
