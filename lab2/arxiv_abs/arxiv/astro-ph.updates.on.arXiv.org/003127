A new Statistical-likelihood Exo-Planetary Habitability Index (SEPHI) is presented. It has been
developed to cover the current and future features required for a classification scheme disentangling
whether any discovered exoplanet is potentially habitable compared with life on Earth. The SEPHI
uses likelihood functions to estimate the habitability potential. It is defined as the geometric
mean of four sub-indexes related with four comparison criteria: Is the planet telluric?; Does it
have an atmosphere dense enough and a gravity compatible with life?; Does it have liquid water on
its surface?; Does it have a magnetic field shielding its surface from harmful radiation and stellar
winds?. Only with seven physical characteristics, can the SEPHI be estimated: Planetary mass,
radius, and orbital period; stellar mass, radius, and effective temperature; planetary system
age. We have applied the SEPHI to all the planets in the Exoplanet Encyclopaedia using a Monte Carlo
Method. Kepler-1229 b, Kepler-186 f, and Kepler-442 b have the largest SEPHI values assuming certain
physical descriptions. Kepler-1229 b is the most unexpected planet in this privileged position
since no previous study pointed to this planet as a potentially interesting and habitable one. In
addition, most of the tidally locked Earth-like planets present a weak magnetic field, incompatible
with habitability potential. We must stress that our results are linked to the physics used in this
study. Any change in the physics used only implies an updating of the likelihood functions. We have
developed a web application allowing the on-line estimation of the SEPHI: this http URL
