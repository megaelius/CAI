We have used the capabilities of ALMA to probe the ionized gas towards the Galactic center with the
H30alpha mm hydrogen recombination line within 30'' of the Galaxy's dynamical center. The observations
are made with spatial and spectral resolutions of 0.46'' X 0.35'' and 3 km/s, respectively. Multiple
compact and extended sources are detected in the mini-cavity region with extreme negative radial
velocities ranging from -480 to -300 km/s, 2-3'' (0.08-0.12 pc) from Sgr A*. This is the highest radial
velocity of ionized gas detected beyond the inner 1'' of Sgr A*. This new component is kinematically
isolated from the orbiting ionized gas. The detected gas has a velocity gradient ranging from -50
to -200 km/s per arcsecond located to the southwest of Sgr A* at a position angle of roughly -160 degrees.
Previous proper motion measurements in the immediate vicinity of these extreme high-velocity
ionized components have been measured and show transverse velocities that range from 313 - 865 km/s.
If we assume that they are associated with each other, then the total velocity implies these components
are gravitationally unbound. In addition, we report the kinematics of cometary radio and infrared
sources. These sources are diagonally distributed with a position angle of roughly 50 degrees within
14'' of Sgr A*. We interpret the highly blue-shifted features to the SW where the mini-cavity is located
and red-shifted cometary sources to the NE in terms of the interaction of a collimated outflow with
an opening angle of roughly 30 degrees. An expected mass outflow rate of 2E-7 or 4E-5 solar mass per
yr is estimated by a relativistic jet-driven outflow or collimated stellar winds, respectively.
