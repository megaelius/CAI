High resolution spectroscopy (R > 20,000) is currently the only known method to constrain the orbital
solution and atmospheric properties of non-transiting hot Jupiters. It does so by resolving the
spectral features of the planet into a forest of spectral lines and directly observing its Doppler
shift while orbiting the host star. In this study, we analyse VLT/CRIRES (R = 100,000) L-band observations
of the non-transiting giant planet HD 179949 b centred around 3.5 microns. We observe a weak (3.0
sigma, or S/N = 4.8) spectral signature of H2O in absorption contained within the radial velocity
of the planet at superior-conjunction, with a mild dependence on the choice of line list used for
the modelling. Combining this data with previous observations in the K-band, we measure a detection
significance of 8.4 sigma for an atmosphere that is most consistent with a shallow lapse-rate, solar
C/O ratio, and with CO and H2O being the only major sources of opacity in this wavelength range. As
the two sets of data were taken three years apart, this points to the absence of strong radial-velocity
anomalies due, e.g., to variability in atmospheric circulation. We measure a projected orbital
velocity for the planet of KP = (145.2 +- 2.0)kms^{-1} (1 sigma) and improve the error bars on this
parameter by ~70%. However, we only marginally tighten constraints on orbital inclination (66.2
+3.7 -3.1 degrees) and planet mass (0.963 +0.036 -0.031 Jupiter masses), due to the dominant uncertainties
of stellar mass and semi-major axis. Follow ups of radial-velocity planets are thus crucial to fully
enable their accurate characterisation via high resolution spectroscopy.
