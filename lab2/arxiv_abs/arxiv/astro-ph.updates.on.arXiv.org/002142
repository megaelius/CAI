We present the study of the H2O spatial distribution at two bright shocked regions along IRAS4A,
one of the strongest H2O emitters among the Class 0 outflows. We obtained Herschel-PACS maps of the
IRAS4A outflow and HIFI observations of two shocked positions. The largest HIFI beam of 38 arcsec
at 557 GHz was mapped in several key water lines with different upper energy levels, to reveal possible
spatial variations of the line profiles. We detect four H2O lines and CO (16-15) at the two selected
positions. In addition, transitions from related outflow and envelope tracers are detected. Different
gas components associated with the shock are identified in the H2O emission. In particular, at the
head of the red lobe of the outflow, two distinct gas components with different excitation conditions
are distinguished in the HIFI emission maps: a compact component, detected in the ground-state
water lines, and a more extended one. Assuming that these two components correspond to two different
temperature components observed in previous H2O and CO studies, the excitation analysis of the
H2O emission suggests that the compact (about 3 arcsec) component is associated with a hot (T~1000
K) gas with densities ~(1-4)x10^5 cm^{-3}, whereas the extended one (10-17 arcsec) traces a warm
(T~300-500 K) and dense gas (~(3-5)x10^7 cm^{-3}). Finally, using the CO (16-15) emission observed
at R2, we estimate the H2O/H2 abundance of the warm and hot components to be (7-10)x10^{-7} and (3-7)x10^{-5}.
Our data allowed us, for the first time, to resolve spatially the two temperature components previously
observed with HIFI and PACS. We propose that the compact hot component may be associated with the
jet that impacts the surrounding material, whereas the warm, dense, and extended component originates
from the compression of the ambient gas by the propagating flow.
