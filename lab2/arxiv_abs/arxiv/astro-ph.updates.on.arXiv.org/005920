We perform a suite of radiation hydrodynamics simulations of photoevaporating disks with varying
the metallicity in a wide range of $10^{-3} \, Z_\odot \leq Z \leq 10^{0.5} \, Z_\odot $. We follow
the disk evolution for over $\sim 5000$ years by solving hydrodynamics, radiative transfer, and
non-equilibrium chemistry. Our chemistry model is updated from the first paper of this series by
adding X-ray ionization and heating. We study the metallicity dependence of the disk photoevaporation
rate and examine the importance of X-ray radiation. In the fiducial case with solar metallicity,
including the X-ray effects does not significantly increase the photoevaporation rate when compared
to the case with ultra-violet (UV) radiation only. At sub-solar metallicities in the range of $Z
\gtrsim 10^{-1.5} \, Z_\odot $, the photoevaporation rate increases as metallicity decreases
owing to the reduced opacity of the disk medium. The result is consistent with the observational
trend that disk lifetimes are shorter in low metallicity environments. Contrastingly, the photoevaporation
rate decreases at even lower metallicities of $Z \lesssim 10^{-1.5} \, Z_\odot $, because dust-gas
collisional cooling remains efficient compared to far UV photoelectric heating whose efficiency
depends on metallicity. The net cooling in the interior of the disk suppresses the photoevaporation.
However, adding X-ray radiation significantly increases the photoevaporation rate, especially
at $Z \sim 10^{-2}\, Z_\odot$. Although the X-ray radiation itself does not drive strong photoevaporative
flows, X-rays penetrate deep into the neutral region in the disk, increase the ionization degree
there, and reduce positive charges of grains. Consequently, the effect of photoelectric heating
by far UV radiation is strengthened by the X-rays and enhances the disk photoevaporation.
