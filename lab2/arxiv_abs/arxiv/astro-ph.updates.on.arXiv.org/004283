The "Antennae Galaxy" (NGC 4038/39) is the closest major interacting galaxy system and therefore
often taken as merger prototype. We present the first comprehensive integral field spectroscopic
dataset of this system, observed with the MUSE instrument at the ESO VLT. We cover the two regions
in this system which exhibit recent star-formation: the central galaxy interaction and a region
near the tip of the southern tidal tail. In these fields, we detect HII regions and diffuse ionized
gas to unprecedented depth. About 15% of the ionized gas was undetected by previous observing campaigns.
This newly detected faint ionized gas is visible everywhere around the central merger, and shows
filamentary structure. We estimate diffuse gas fractions of about 60% in the central field and 10%
in the southern region. We are able to show that the southern region contains a significantly different
population of HII regions, showing fainter luminosities. By comparing HII region luminosities
with the HST catalog of young star clusters in the central field, we estimate that there is enough
Lyman-continuum leakage in the merger to explain the amount of diffuse ionized gas that we detect.
We compare the Lyman-continuum escape fraction of each HII region against ionization-parameter
sensitive emission line ratios. While we find no systematic trend between these properties, the
most extreme line ratios seem to be strong indicators of density bounded ionization. Extrapolating
the Lyman-continuum escape fractions to the southern region, we conclude that just from the comparison
of the young stellar populations to the ionized gas there is no need to invoke other ionization mechanisms
than Lyman-continuum leaking HII regions for the diffuse ionized gas in the Antennae.
