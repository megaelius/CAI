We study the space density evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) using the $610 \ \mathrm{MHz}$
radio survey of the XXL-North field, performed with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT).
The survey covers an area of $30.4 \ \mathrm{deg}^2$, with a beamsize of $6.5 \ \mathrm{arcsec}$.
The survey is divided into two parts, one covering an area of $11.9 \ \mathrm{deg}^2$ with $1 \sigma$
rms noise of $200\ \mathrm{\mu Jy \ beam^{-1}}$ and the other spanning $18.5 \ \mathrm{deg}^2$ with
rms noise of $45\ \mathrm{\mu Jy \ beam^{-1}}$. We extracted the catalog of radio components above
$7 \sigma$. The catalog was cross-matched with a multi-wavelength catalog of the XXL-North field
(covering about $80 \%$ of the radio XXL-North field) using a likelihood ratio method, which determines
the counterparts based on their positions and their optical properties. The multi-component sources
were matched visually with the aid of a computer code: Multi-Catalog Visual Cross-Matching (MCVCM).
A flux density cut above $1\ \mathrm{mJy}$ selects AGN hosts with a high purity in terms of star formation
contamination based on the available source counts. After cross-matching and elimination of observational
biases arising from survey incompletenesses, the number of remaining sources was $1150$. We constructed
the rest-frame $1.4 \ \mathrm{GHz}$ radio luminosity functions of these sources using the maximum
volume method. This survey allows us to probe luminosities of $ 23 \lesssim \log(L_{1.4 \ \mathrm{GHz}}[\mathrm{W/Hz}])
\lesssim 28$ up to redshifts of $z \approx 2.1$. Our results are consistent with the results from
the literature in which AGN are comprised of two differently evolving populations, where the high
luminosity end of the luminosity functions evolves more strongly than the low-luminosity end.
