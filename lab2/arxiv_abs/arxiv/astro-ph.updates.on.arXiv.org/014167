We collected over 6000 high-resolution spectra of four dozen field RR Lyrae (RRL) variables pulsating
either in the fundamental (39 RRab) or in the first overtone (9 RRc) mode. We measured radial velocities
(RVs) of four strong metallic and four Balmer lines along the entire pulsational cycle and derived
RV amplitudes with accuracies better than 1$-$2~\kmsec. The new amplitudes were combined with
literature data for 23~RRab and 3~RRc stars (total sample 74 RRLs) which allowed us to investigate
the variation of the Bailey diagram (photometric amplitude versus period) when moving from optical
to mid-infrared bands and to re-cast the Bailey diagram in terms of RV amplitudes. We found that RV
amplitudes for RRab are minimally affected by nonlinear phenomena (shocks) and multi-periodicity
(Blazhko effect). The RV slope ($\log P$--A(V$_r$)) when compared with the visual slope ($\log
P$--A($V$)) is shallower and the dispersion, at fixed period, decreases by a factor of two. We constructed
homogeneous sets of Horizontal Branch evolutionary models and nonlinear, convective pulsation
models of RRLs to constrain the impact of evolutionary effects on their pulsation properties. Evolution
causes, on the Bailey diagram based on RV amplitudes, a modest variation in pulsation period and
a large dispersion in amplitude. The broad dispersion in period of the Bailey diagram is mainly caused
by variation in RRL intrinsic parameters (stellar mass, chemical composition). Empirical evidence
indicates that RV amplitudes are an optimal diagnostic for tracing the mean effective temperature
across the RRab instability strip.
