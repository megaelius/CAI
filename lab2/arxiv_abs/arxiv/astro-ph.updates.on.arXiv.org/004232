The radiolysis of a nitrogen-acetone mixture, condensed at 11 K, by 40 MeV $^{58}$Ni$^{11+}$ ions
is studied. These results are representative of studies concerning solar system objects exposed
to cosmic rays. In the Kuiper Belt, region of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), acetone, molecular
nitrogen and other small molecules were detected and may be present on icy surfaces. Bombardment
by cosmic rays triggers chemical reactions leading to synthesis of larger molecules. In this work,
destruction cross sections of acetone and nitrogen in solid phase are determined from a sequence
of infrared spectra obtained at increasing ion beam fluence. The results are analyzed and compared
with those of previous experiments performed with pure acetone. It is observed that the molecular
nitrogen column density decrease very fast, suggesting that nitrogen quickly leaves a porous sample
under irradiation. The behavior of acetone in the mixture confirms that the ice formed by deposition
of vapor mixture is more porous than that of pure acetone ice. The most abundant molecular species
formed from the mixture during irradiation are: C$_3$H$_6$, C$_2$H$_6$, N$_3$, CO, CH$_4$ and
CO$_2$. Some N-bearing species are also formed, but with low production yield. Comparing with pure
acetone results, it is seen that dissolving acetone in nitrogen affects the formation cross sections
of the new species: CH$_4$, CO$_2$ and H$_2$CO, for example, have formation cross section smaller
than the respective values for irradiated pure acetone, while those for CO and C$_2$H$_6$ species
are higher. This fact can explain the presence of C$_2$H$_6$ even in regions on Pluto where CH$_4$
is not pure, but diluted in a N$_2$ matrix together with less abundant species. These results also
show the formation of more complex molecules, such as HNCO, acetic acid and, possibility, glycine.
