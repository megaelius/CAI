Within a galaxy the stellar mass-to-light ratio $\Upsilon_*$ is not constant. We show that ignoring
$\Upsilon_*$ gradients can have a more dramatic effect on dynamical ($M_*^{\rm dyn}$) compared
to stellar population ($M_*^{\rm SP}$) based estimates of early-type galaxy stellar masses, because
$M_*^{\rm dyn}$ is usually calibrated using the velocity dispersion measured in the central regions.
If $\Upsilon_*$ is greater there, then ignoring the gradient will lead to an overestimate of $M_*^{\rm
dyn}$. Spatially resolved kinematics of nearby early-type galaxies suggests that these gradients
are driven by gradients in the initial mass function (IMF). Accounting for recent estimates of the
IMF-driven $\Upsilon_*$ gradient reduces $M_*^{\rm dyn}$ substantially ($\sim$ a factor of two),
and may be accompanied by a (smaller) change in $M_*^{\rm SP}$. Our results suggest that $M_*^{\rm
dyn}$ estimates in the literature should be revised downwards, rather than revising $M_*^{\rm
SP}$ estimates upwards. This has three consequences. First, if gradients in $\Upsilon_*$ are present,
then $M_*^{\rm dyn}$ cannot be estimated independently of stellar population synthesis models.
Second, accounting for $\Upsilon_*$ gradients changes the slope of the stellar mass function $\phi(M_*^{\rm
dyn})$, and reduces the associated stellar mass density, especially at high masses. Third, if gradients
are stronger in more massive galaxies, then accounting for this reduces the slope of the correlation
between the ratio of the dynamical and stellar population mass estimates of a galaxy with its velocity
dispersion. These conclusions potentially impact estimates of the need for feedback and adiabatic
contraction, so our results highlight the importance of measurements of $\Upsilon_*$ gradients
in larger samples.
