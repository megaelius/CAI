We analyze the anisotropic clustering of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV Extended Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) Luminous Red Galaxy Data Release 14 (DR14) sample combined with Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) CMASS sample of galaxies in the redshift range 0.6$<z<$1.0,
which consists of 80,118 galaxies from eBOSS and 46,439 galaxies from the BOSS-CMASS sample. The
eBOSS-CMASS Luminous Red Galaxy sample has a sky coverage of 1,844 deg$^2$, with an effective volume
of 0.9 Gpc$^3$. The analysis was made in configuration space using a Legendre multipole expansion.
The Redshift Space Distortion signal is modeled as a combination of the Convolution Lagrangian
Perturbation Model and the Gaussian Streaming Model. We constrain the logarithmic growth of structure
times the amplitude of dark matter density fluctuations, $f (z_{\rm eff})\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff})=0.454
\pm0.139 $, and the Alcock-Paczynski dilation scales which constraints the angular diameter distance
$D_A(z_{eff})=1466.5 \pm 136.6 (r_s/r_s^{\rm fid})$ and $H(z_{\rm eff})=105.8 \pm 16 (r_s^{\rm
fid}/r_s) \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, where $r_s$ is the sound horizon at the end of the baryon
drag epoch and $r_s^{\rm fid}$ is its value in the fiducial cosmology at an effective redshift $z_{\rm
eff}=0.72$. These results are in full agreement with the current $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$-CDM)
cosmological model inferred from Planck measurements. This study is the first eBOSS LRG full-shape
analysis i.e. including Redshift-Space Distortions (RSD) simultaneously with the Alcock-Paczynski
(AP) effect and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale.
