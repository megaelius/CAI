In this paper, we report our multiwavelength imaging observations of chromospheric evaporation
in a C5.5 circular-ribbon flare (CRF) on 2014 August 24. The flare was observed by the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory} (\textit{SDO}), X-ray
Telescope (XRT) on board the \textit{Hinode} spacecraft, and ground-based Nobeyama Radioheliograph
(NoRH). The CRF consisted of a discrete circular ribbon with a diameter of $\sim$1$\arcmin$ and
a short inner ribbon observed in ultraviolet (UV), extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), soft X-ray (SXR),
and especially in 17 GHz. The peak time ($\sim$04:58 UT) of the flare in 17 GHz coincided with that
in UV 1600 {\AA} and SXR derivative as a hard X-ray proxy, implying the peak time of impulsive energy
deposition in the lower atmosphere. Shortly after the peak time, converging motion and filling
process in the flare loop were revealed in AIA 131 {\AA} and two XRT filters (Be\_thin and Be\_med),
which are clear evidence for chromospheric evaporation upflows. The chromospheric evaporation
lasted for $\sim$6 minutes until $\sim$05:04 UT. The temperature, density, and apparent velocities
of the upflows are $\sim$10$^7$ K, $\sim$1.8$\times$10$^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$, and 50$-$630 km s$^{-1}$
with a mean value of $\sim$170 km s$^{-1}$. By comparison with previous models, we are able to estimate
that energies above 5$\times$10$^{10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ are likely needed to explain the
observational results. Since heating by thermal conduction does not seem to provide enough energy,
alternative mechanisms such as nonthermal electrons or Alfv\'{e}nic waves might need to be invoked.
