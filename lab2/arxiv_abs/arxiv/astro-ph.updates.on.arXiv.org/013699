Determining the efficiency with which gas is converted into stars in galaxies requires an accurate
determination of the total reservoir of molecular gas mass. However, despite being the most abundant
molecule in the Universe, H$_2$ is challenging to detect through direct observations and indirect
methods have to be used to estimate the total molecular gas reservoir. These are often based on scaling
relations from tracers such as CO or dust, and are generally calibrated in the Milky Way. Yet, evidence
that these scaling relations are environmentally dependent is growing. In particular, the commonly
used CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor (X$_{\rm CO}$) is expected to be higher in metal-poor and/or
strongly UV-irradiated environments. We use new SOFIA/FIFI-LS observations of far-infrared
fine structure lines from the ionised and neutral gas and the Meudon photodissociation region model
to constrain the physical properties and the structure of the gas in the massive star-forming region
of 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and determine the spatially resolved distribution
of the total reservoir of molecular gas in the proximity of the young massive cluster R136. We compare
this value with the molecular gas mass inferred from ground-based CO observations and dust-based
estimates to quantify the impact of this extreme environment on commonly used tracers of the molecular
gas. We find that the strong radiation field combined with the half-solar metallicity of the surrounding
gas are responsible for a large reservoir of "CO-dark" molecular gas, leaving a large fraction of
the total H$_2$ gas (> 75%) undetected when adopting a standard X$_{\rm CO}$ factor in this massive
star-forming region.
