While planet formation is thought to occur early in the history of a protoplanetary disk, the presence
of planets embedded in disks, or of other processes driving disk evolution, might be traced from
their imprints on the disk structure. We observed the T Tauri star HD 143006, located in the 5-11 Myr-old
Upper Sco region, in polarized scattered light with VLT/SPHERE at near-infrared wavelengths,
reaching an angular resolution of ~0.037" (~6 au). We obtained two datasets, one with a 145 mas diameter
coronagraph, and the other without, enabling us to probe the disk structure down to an angular separation
of ~0.06" (~10 au). In our observations, the disk of HD 143006 is clearly resolved up to ~0.5" and shows
a clear large-scale asymmetry with the eastern side brighter than the western side. We detect a number
of additional features, including two gaps and a ring. The ring shows an overbrightness at a position
angle (PA) of ~140 deg, extending over a range in position angle of ~60 deg, and two narrow dark regions.
The two narrow dark lanes and the overall large-scale asymmetry are indicative of shadowing effects,
likely due to a misaligned inner disk. We demonstrate the remarkable resemblance between the scattered
light image of HD 143006 and a model prediction of a warped disk due to an inclined binary companion.
The warped disk model, based on the hydrodynamic simulations combined with 3D radiative transfer
calculations, reproduces all major morphological features. However, it does not account for the
observed overbrightness at PA~140 deg. Shadows have been detected in several protoplanetary disks,
suggesting that misalignment in disks is not uncommon. However, the origin of the misalignment
is not clear. As-yet-undetected stellar or massive planetary companions could be responsible
for them, and naturally account for the presence of depleted inner cavities.
