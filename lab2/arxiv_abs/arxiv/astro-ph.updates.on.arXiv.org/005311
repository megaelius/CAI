The search for habitable exoplanets inspires the question - how do habitable planets form? Planet
habitability models traditionally focus on abiotic processes and neglect a biotic response to
changing conditions on an inhabited planet. The Gaia hypothesis postulates that life influences
the Earth's feedback mechanisms to form a self-regulating system, and hence that life can maintain
habitable conditions on its host planet. If life has a strong influence, it will have a role in determining
a planet's habitability over time. We present the ExoGaia model - a model of simple 'planets' host
to evolving microbial biospheres. Microbes interact with their host planet via consumption and
excretion of atmospheric chemicals. Model planets orbit a 'star' which provides incoming radiation,
and atmospheric chemicals have either an albedo, or a heat-trapping property. Planetary temperatures
can therefore be altered by microbes via their metabolisms. We seed multiple model planets with
life while their atmospheres are still forming and find that the microbial biospheres are, under
suitable conditions, generally able to prevent the host planets from reaching inhospitable temperatures,
as would happen on a lifeless planet. We find that the underlying geochemistry plays a strong role
in determining long-term habitability prospects of a planet. We find five distinct classes of model
planets, including clear examples of 'Gaian bottlenecks' - a phenomenon whereby life either rapidly
goes extinct leaving an inhospitable planet, or survives indefinitely maintaining planetary
habitability. These results suggest that life might play a crucial role in determining the long-term
habitability of planets.
