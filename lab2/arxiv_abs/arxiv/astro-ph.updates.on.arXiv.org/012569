The Milky Way nuclear star cluster (MWNSC) is a crucial laboratory for studying the galactic nuclei
of other galaxies, but its properties have not been determined unambiguously until now. Aims. We
aim to study the size and spatial structure of the MWNSC. Methods. This study uses data and methods
that address potential shortcomings of previous studies on the topic. We use $0.2''$ angular resolution
$K_{s}$ data to create a stellar density map in the central $86.4$pc x $21$pc at the Galactic center.
We include data from selected adaptive-optics-assisted images obtained for the inner parsecs.
In addition, we use IRAC/Spitzer mid-infrared (MIR) images. We model the Galactic bulge and the
nuclear stellar disk in order to subtract them from the MWNSC. Finally, we fit a S\'ersic model to
the MWNSC and investigate its symmetry. Results. Our results are consistent with previous work.
The MWNSC is flattened with an axis ratio of $q=0.71 \pm0.10$, an effective radius of $R_{e}=(5.1
\pm1.0)$ pc, and a S\'ersic index of $n=2.2 \pm0.7$. Its major axis may be tilted out of the Galactic
plane by up to $-10$ degrees. The distribution of the giants brighter than the Red Clump (RC) is found
to be significantly flatter than the distribution of the faint stars. We investigate the 3D structure
of the central stellar cusp using our results on the MWNSC structure on large scales to constrain
the deprojection of the measured stellar surface number density, obtaining a value of the 3D inner
power law of $\gamma=1.38\pm0.06_{sys}\pm0.01_{stat}$. Conclusions. The MWNSC shares its main
properties with other extragalactic NSCs found in spiral galaxies. The differences in the structure
between bright giants and RC stars might be related to the existence of not completely mixed populations
of different ages. This may hint at recent growth of the MWNSC through star formation or cluster accretion.
