The central area (40"x40") of the bipolar nebula S106 was mapped in the OI line at 63.2 micron with
high angular (6") and spectral resolution, using GREAT on board SOFIA. The OI emission distribution
is compared to the CO 16-15, CII 158 micron, and CO 11-10 lines, mm-molecular lines, and continuum.
It is composed of several velocity components in the range from -30 km/s to 25 km/s. The high-velocity
blue- and redshifted emission can be explained as arising from accelerated photodissociated (PDR)
gas associated with a dark lane close to the massive binary system S106 IR, and from shocks caused
by the stellar wind and/or a disk--envelope interaction. At velocities from -9 to -4 km/s and 0.5
to 8 km/s line wings are observed that we attribute to cooling in PDRs created by the ionizing radiation
impinging on the cavity walls. The bulk velocity range is dominated by PDR emission from the clumpy
molecular cloud. Modelling the emission in the different velocity ranges with the KOSMA-tau code
constrains a radiation field chi of a few times 10^4 and densities n of a few times 10^4 cm^-3. Considering
self-absorption of the OI line results in higher densities (up to 10^6 cm^-3) only for the gas component
seen at high blue- and red velocities. The dark lane has a mass of 275 Msun and shows a velocity difference
of 1.4 km/s along its projected length of 1 pc, determined from H13CO+ 1-0 mapping. It can be interpreted
as a massive accretion flow, or the remains of it, linked to S106 IR/FIR. The most likely explanation
is that the binary system is at a stage of its evolution where gas accretion is counteracted by the
stellar winds and radiation, leading to the very complex observed spatial and kinematic emission
distribution of the various tracers.
