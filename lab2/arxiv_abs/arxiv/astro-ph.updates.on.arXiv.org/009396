We present a mid-infrared (IR) sample study of nearby ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) using
multi-epoch observations with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope.
Spitzer/IRAC observations taken after 2014 were obtained as part of the Spitzer Infrared Intensive
Transients Survey (SPIRITS). Our sample includes 96 ULXs located within 10 Mpc. Of the 96~ULXs,
12 have candidate counterparts consistent with absolute mid-IR magnitudes of supergiants, and
16 counterparts exceeded the mid-IR brightness of single supergiants and are thus more consistent
with star clusters or non-ULX background active galactic nuclei (AGN). The supergiant candidate
counterparts exhibit a bi-modal color distribution in a Spitzer/IRAC color-magnitude diagram,
where "red" and "blue" ULXs fall in IRAC colors $[3.6] - [4.5]\sim0.7$ and $[3.6] - [4.5]\sim0.0$,
respectively. The mid-IR colors and absolute magnitudes of 4 "red" and 5 "blue" ULXs are consistent
with that of supergiant B[e] (sgB[e]) and red supergiant (RSG) stars, respectively. While "blue",
RSG-like mid-IR ULX counterparts likely host RSG mass donors, we propose the "red" counterparts
are ULXs exhibiting the "B[e] phenomenon'' rather than hosts of sgB[e] mass donors. We show that
the mid-IR excess from the "red" ULXs is likely due to thermal emission from circumstellar or circumbinary
dust. Using dust as a probe for total mass, we estimate mass-loss rates of $\dot{M}\sim1\times10^{-4}$
M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ in dust-forming outflows of red ULXs. Based on the transient mid-IR behavior
and its relatively flat spectral index, $\alpha=-0.19\pm0.1$, we suggest that the mid-IR emission
from Holmberg IX X-1 originates from a variable jet.
