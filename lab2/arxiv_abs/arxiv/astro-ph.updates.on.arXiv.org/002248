Recently, the Kepler Space Telescope has detected several planets in orbit around a close binary
star system. These so-called circumbinary planets will experience non-trivial spatial and temporal
distributions of radiative flux on their surfaces, with features not seen in their single-star
orbiting counterparts. Earthlike circumbinary planets inhabited by photosynthetic organisms
will be forced to adapt to these unusual flux patterns. We map the flux received by putative Earthlike
planets (as a function of surface latitude/longitude and time) orbiting the binary star systems
Kepler-16 and Kepler-47, two star systems which already boast circumbinary exoplanet detections.
The longitudinal and latitudinal distribution of flux is sensitive to the centre of mass motion
of the binary, and the relative orbital phases of the binary and planet. Total eclipses of the secondary
by the primary, as well as partial eclipses of the primary by the secondary add an extra forcing term
to the system. We also find that the patterns of darkness on the surface are equally unique. Beyond
the planet's polar circles, the surface spends a significantly longer time in darkness than latitudes
around the equator, due to the stars' motions delaying the first sunrise of spring (or hastening
the last sunset of autumn). In the case of Kepler-47, we also find a weak longitudinal dependence
for darkness, but this effect tends to average out if considered over many orbits. In the light of
these flux and darkness patterns, we consider and discuss the prospects and challenges for photosynthetic
organisms, using terrestrial analogues as a guide.
