[Abridged] Millisecond duration bright radio pulses in the 1.4-GHz band and with inferred dispersion
measures (DM) well in excess of Galactic values have been reported by Lorimer et al. and Thornton
et al.. The all-sky rate of these events is large, ~10^4 per day above ~1 Jy. To add to the mystery there
now exists "Perytons'' -- also pulsed and dispersed sources but most certainly of local (artificial
or atmospheric) origin. The suggested models now range from sources originating in the Earth's
atmosphere, in stellar coronae, in other galaxies and at even cosmological distances. Using a series
of physically motivated assumptions combined with the observed properties of these bursts, we
explore possible constraints on sites or processes that can account for such high DMs. In our analysis,
we focus on the first such reported event by Lorimer et al.: a 30 Jy, 5-ms duration burst with a dispersion
measure of 375 cm^-3 pc and exhibiting a steep frequency-dependent pulse width (hereafter dubbed
as the Sparker). Assuming that the DM of the Sparker is produced by propagation through a cold plasma
and using all available observations we constrain its distance to be greater than 300 kpc. A similar
analysis on the four other reported events (all with larger DMs) would lead to a stronger conclusion,
namely these "Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)'' (the moniker given to this group by the discoverers) are
of extragalactic origin, provided that the inferred DM arises due to propagation through cold plasma.
We then explore proposed extra-galactic as well as stellar coronal models for FRBs and find most
of them either unable to account for the high daily rate or have difficulty in having an ultra-clean
explosion site (essential to the production of high brightness temperature pulse) or suffer from
free-free absorption on length scales beyond the immediate production of the radio pulses.
