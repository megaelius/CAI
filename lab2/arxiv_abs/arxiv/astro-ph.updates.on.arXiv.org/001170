Owing to their shallow stellar potential, dwarf galaxies possess thick gas disks, which makes them
good candidates for studies of the galactic vertical kinematical structure. We present 21 cm line
observations of the isolated nearby dwarf irregular galaxy UGCA 105, taken with the Westerbork
Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT), and analyse the geometry of its neutral hydrogen (HI) disk and
its kinematics. The galaxy shows a fragmented HI distribution. It is more extended than the optical
disk, and hence allows one to determine its kinematics out to very large galacto-centric distances.
The HI kinematics and morphology are well-ordered and symmetric for an irregular galaxy. The HI
is sufficiently extended to observe a substantial amount of differential rotation. Moreover,
UGCA 105 shows strong signatures for the presence of a kinematically anomalous gas component. Performing
tilted-ring modelling by use of the least-squares fitting routine TiRiFiC, we found that the HI
disk of UGCA 105 has a moderately warped and diffuse outermost part. Probing a wide range of parameter
combinations, we succeeded in modelling the data cube as a disk with a strong vertical gradient in
rotation velocity ($\approx -60\,\rm km\,s^{-1}\,kpc^{-1}$), as well as vertically increasing
inwards motion ($\approx -70\,\rm km\,s^{-1}\,kpc^{-1}$) within the radius of the stellar disk.
The inferred radial gas inflow amounts to $0.06\,\rm M_\odot \rm yr^{-1}$, which is similar to the
star formation rate of the galaxy. The observed kinematics are hence compatible with direct or indirect
accretion from the intergalactic medium, an extreme backflow of material that has formerly been
expelled from the disk, or a combination of both.
