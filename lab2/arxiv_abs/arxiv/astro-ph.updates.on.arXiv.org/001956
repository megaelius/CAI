We present NuSTAR high energy X-ray observations of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN)/supernova remnant
G21.5-0.9. We detect integrated emission from the nebula up to ~40 keV, and resolve individual spatial
features over a broad X-ray band for the first time. The morphology seen by NuSTAR agrees well with
that seen by XMM-Newton and Chandra below 10 keV. At high energies NuSTAR clearly detects non-thermal
emission up to ~20 keV that extends along the eastern and northern rim of the supernova shell. The
broadband images clearly demonstrate that X-ray emission from the North Spur and Eastern Limb results
predominantly from non-thermal processes. We detect a break in the spatially integrated X-ray
spectrum at ~9 keV that cannot be reproduced by current SED models, implying either a more complex
electron injection spectrum or an additional process such as diffusion compared to what has been
considered in previous work. We use spatially resolved maps to derive an energy-dependent cooling
length scale, $L(E) \propto E^{m}$ with $m = -0.21 \pm 0.01$. We find this to be inconsistent with
the model for the morphological evolution with energy described by Kennel & Coroniti (1984).
This value, along with the observed steepening in power-law index between radio and X-ray, can be
quantitatively explained as an energy-loss spectral break in the simple scaling model of Reynolds
(2009), assuming particle advection dominates over diffusion. This interpretation requires
a substantial departure from spherical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD), magnetic-flux-conserving
outflow, most plausibly in the form of turbulent magnetic-field amplification.
