We investigate the interstellar medium (ISM) towards seven TeV gamma-ray sources thought to be
pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) using Mopra molecular line observations at 7mm [CS(1-0), SiO(1-0,v=0)],
Nanten CO(1-0) data and the SGPS/GASS HI survey. We have discovered several dense molecular clouds
co-located to these TeV gamma-ray sources , which allows us to search for cosmic-rays (CRs) coming
from progenitor SNRs or, potentially, from PWNe. We notably found SiO(1-0,v=0) emission towards
HESS J1809-193, highlighting possible interaction between the adjacent supernova remnant SNR
G011.0-0.0 and the molecular cloud at d $\sim$ 3.7 kpc. Using morphological features, and comparative
studies of our column densities with those obtained from X-ray measurements, we claim a distance
d $\sim$ 8.6 - 9.7 kpc for SNR G292.2-00.5, d $\sim$ 3.5 - 5.6 kpc for PSR J1418-6058 and d $\sim$ 1.5
kpc for the new SNR candidate found towards HESS J1303-631. From our mass and density estimates of
selected molecular clouds, we discuss signatures of hadronic/leptonic components from PWNe and
their progenitor SNRs. Interestingly, the molecular gas, which overlaps HESS J1026-582 at d $\sim$
5 kpc, may support a hadronic origin. We find however that this scenario requires an undetected cosmic-ray
accelerator to be located at d $\lt$ 10 pc from the molecular cloud. For HESS J1809-193, the cosmic-rays
which have escaped SNR G011.0-0.0 could contribute to the TeV gamma-ray emission. Finally, from
the hypothesis that at most 20% the pulsar spin down power could be converted into CRs, we find that,
among the studied PWNe, only those from PSR J1809-1917 could potentially contribute to the TeV emission.
