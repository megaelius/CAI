We utilize deep near-infrared survey data from the UltraVISTA fourth data release (DR4) and the
VIDEO survey, in combination with overlapping optical and Spitzer data, to search for bright star-forming
galaxies at $z \gtrsim 7.5$. Using a full photometric redshift fitting analysis applied to the $\sim
6\,{\rm deg}^2$ of imaging searched, we find 27 Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs), including 20 new sources,
with best-fitting photometric redshifts in the range $7.4 < z < 9.1$. From this sample we derive the
rest-frame UV luminosity function (LF) at $z = 8$ and $z = 9$ out to extremely bright UV magnitudes
($M_{\rm UV} \simeq -23$) for the first time. We find an excess in the number density of bright galaxies
in comparison to the typically assumed Schechter functional form derived from fainter samples.
Combined with previous studies at lower redshift, our results show that there is little evolution
in the number density of very bright ($M_{\rm UV} \sim -23$) LBGs between $z \simeq 5$ and $z\simeq
9$. The tentative detection of an LBG with best-fit photometric redshift of $z = 10.9 \pm 1.0$ in our
data is consistent with the derived evolution. We show that a double power-law fit with a brightening
characteristic magnitude ($\Delta M^*/\Delta z \simeq -0.5$) and a steadily steepening bright-end
slope ($\Delta \beta/\Delta z \simeq -0.5$) provides a good description of the $z > 5$ data over a
wide range in absolute UV magnitude ($-23 < M_{\rm UV} < -17$). We postulate that the observed evolution
can be explained by a lack of mass quenching at very high redshifts in combination with increasing
dust obscuration within the first $\sim 1 \,{\rm Gyr}$ of galaxy evolution.
