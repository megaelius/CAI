Numerical solutions of the cosmic-ray (CR) magneto-hydrodynamic equations are dogged by a powerful
numerical instability, which arises from the constraint that CRs can only stream down their gradient.
The standard cure is to regularize by adding artificial diffusion. Besides introducing ad-hoc
smoothing, this has a significant negative impact on either computational cost or complexity and
parallel scalings. We describe a new numerical algorithm for CR transport, with close parallels
to two moment methods for radiative transfer under the reduced speed of light approximation. It
stably and robustly handles CR streaming without any artificial diffusion. It allows for both isotropic
and field-aligned CR streaming and diffusion, with arbitrary streaming and diffusion coefficients.
CR transport is handled explicitly, while source terms are handled implicitly. The overall time-step
scales linearly with resolution (even when computing CR diffusion), and has a perfect parallel
scaling. It is given by the standard Courant condition with respect to a constant maximum velocity
over the entire simulation domain. The computational cost is comparable to that of solving the ideal
MHD equation. We demonstrate the accuracy and stability of this new scheme with a wide variety of
tests, including anisotropic streaming and diffusion tests, CR modified shocks, CR driven blast
waves, and CR transport in multi-phase media. The new algorithm opens doors to much more ambitious
and hitherto intractable calculations of CR physics in galaxies and galaxy clusters. It can also
be applied to other physical processes with similar mathematical structure, such as saturated,
anisotropic heat conduction.
