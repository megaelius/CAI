We determine the forecast errors on the absolute neutrino mass scale and the equation of state of
dark energy by combining synthetic data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) Planck surveyor. We use angular clustering of galaxies for DES in 7 redshift shells
up to $z\sim 1.7$ including cross-correlations between different redshift shells. We study models
with massless and massive neutrinos and three different dark energy models: $\Lambda$CDM ($w=-1$),
wCDM (constant $w$), and waCDM (evolving equation of state parameter $w(a)=w_0 + w_{a}(1-a)$).
We include the impact of uncertainties in modeling galaxy bias using a constant and a redshift-evolving
bias model. For the $\Lambda$CDM model we obtain an upper limit for the sum of neutrino masses from
DES+Planck of $\Sigma m_\nu < 0.08$ eV (95\% C.L.) for a fiducial mass of $\Sigma m_\nu = 0.047$
eV, with a 1$\sigma$ error of 0.02 eV, assuming perfect knowledge of galaxy bias. For the wCDM model
the limit is $\Sigma m_\nu < 0.10 $ eV. For a wCDM model where galaxy bias evolves with redshift,
the upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses increases to 0.19 eV. DES will be able to place competitive
upper limits on the sum of neutrino masses of 0.1-0.2 eV and could therefore strongly constrain the
inverted mass hierarchy of neutrinos. In a wCDM model the 1$\sigma$ error on constant $w$ is $\Delta
w= 0.03$ from DES galaxy clustering and Planck. Allowing $\Sigma m_\nu$ as a free parameter increases
the error on $w$ by a factor of 2, with $\Delta w=0.06$. In a waCDM model, in which the dark energy equation
of state varies with time, the errors are $\Delta w_0 = 0.2$ and $\Delta w_a = 0.42$. Including neutrinos
and redshift dependent galaxy bias increases the errors to $\Delta w_0 = 0.35$ and $\Delta w_a = 0.89$.
