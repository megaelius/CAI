Context. Betelgeuse is the closest red supergiant (RSG); therefore, it is well suited for studying
the complex processes in its atmosphere that lead to the chemical enrichment of the interstellar
medium. Aims. We intend to investigate the shape and composition of the close molecular layer (also
known as the MOLsphere) that surrounds the star. This analysis is part of a wider program that aims
at understanding the dynamics of the circumstellar envelope of Betelgeuse. Methods. On January
and February 2011, Betelgeuse was observed using the Astronomical Multi-BEam combineR (AMBER)
instrument of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) in the H and K bands. Using the medium
spectral resolution of the instrument (R $\sim$ 1500), we were able to investigate the carbon monoxide
band heads and the water-vapor bands. We used two different approaches to analyse our data: a model
fit in both the continuum and absorption lines and then a fit with a Radiative HydroDynamics (RHD)
simulation. Results. Using the continuum data, we derive a uniform disk diameter of $41.01 \pm 0.41$~mas,
a power law type limb-darkened disk diameter of $42.28 \pm 0.43$~mas and a limb-darkening exponent
of $0.155 \pm 0.009$. Within the absorption lines, using a single layer model, we obtain parameters
of the MOLsphere. Using a RHD simulation, we unveil the convection pattern in the visibilities.
Conclusions. We derived a new value of the angular diameter of Betelgeuse in the K band continuum.
Our observations in the absorption lines are well reproduced by a molecular layer at 1.2 stellar
radii containing both CO and H$_2$O. The visibilities at higher spatial frequencies are matching
a convection pattern in a RHD simulation.
