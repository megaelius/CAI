Studies of large-scale structures in the Universe, such as superstructures or cosmic voids, have
been widely used to characterize the properties of the cosmic web through statistical analyses.
On the other hand, the 2-point correlation function of large-scale tracers such as galaxies or halos
provides a reliable statistical measure. However, this function applies to the spatial distribution
of point-like objects, and therefore it is not appropriate for extended large structures which
strongly depart from spherical symmetry. Here we present an analysis based on the standard correlation
function formalism that can be applied to extended objects exhibiting arbitrary shapes. Following
this approach, we compute the probability excess $\Xi$ of having spheres sharing parts of cosmic
structures with respect to a realization corresponding to a distribution of the same structures
in random positions. For this aim, we identify superstructures defined as Future Virialized Structures
(FVSs) in semi-anaytic galaxies on the MPDL2 MultiDark simulation. We have also identified cosmic
voids to provide a joint study of their relative distribution with respect to the superstructures.
Our analysis suggests that $\Xi$ provides useful characterizations of the large scale distribution,
as suggested from an analysis of sub-sets of the simulation. Even when superstructure properties
may exhibit negligible variations across the sub-sets, $\Xi$ has the sensitivity to statistically
distinguish sub-boxes that departs from the mean at larger scales. Thus, our methods can be applied
in analysis of future surveys to provide characterizations of large-scale structure suitable
to distinguish different theoretical scenarios.
