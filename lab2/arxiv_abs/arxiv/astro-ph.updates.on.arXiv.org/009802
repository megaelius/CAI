We study and compare different examples of stellar evolutionary synthesis input parameters used
to produce photoionisation model grids using the MAPPINGS V modelling code. The aim of this study
is to (a) explore the systematic effects of various stellar evolutionary synthesis model parameters
on the interpretation of emission lines in optical strong-line diagnostic diagrams, (b) characterise
the combination of parameters able to reproduce the spread of local galaxies located in the star-forming
region in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and (c) investigate the emission from extremely metal-poor
galaxies using photoionisation models. We explore and compare the stellar input ionising spectrum
(stellar population synthesis code [Starburst99, SLUG, BPASS], stellar evolutionary tracks,
stellar atmospheres, star-formation history, sampling of the initial mass function) as well as
parameters intrinsic to the H II region (metallicity, ionisation parameter, pressure, H II region
boundedness). We also perform a comparison of the photoionisation codes MAPPINGS and CLOUDY. On
the variations in the ionising spectrum model parameters, we find that the differences in strong
emission-line ratios between varying models for a given input model parameter are small, on average
~0.1 dex. An average difference of ~0.1 dex in emission-line ratio is also found between models produced
with MAPPINGS and CLOUDY. Large differences between the emission-line ratios are found when comparing
intrinsic H II region parameters. We find that low-metallicity galaxies are better explained by
a density-bounded H II region and higher pressures better encompass the spread of galaxies at high
redshift.
