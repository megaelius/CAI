The role played by the large-scale environment on the nuclear activity of radio galaxies (RGs),
is still not completely understood. Accretion mode, jet power and galaxy evolution are connected
with their large-scale environment from tens to hundreds of kpc. Here we present a detailed, statistical,
analysis of the large-scale environment for two samples of RGs up to redshifts $z_\mathrm{src}$=0.15.
The main advantages of our study, with respect to those already present in the literature, are due
to the extremely homogeneous selection criteria of catalogs adopted to perform our investigation.
This is also coupled with the use of several clustering algorithms. We performed a direct search
of galaxy-rich environments around RGs using them as beacon. To perform this study we also developed
a new method that does not appear to suffer by a strong $z_\mathrm{src}$ dependence as other algorithms.
We conclude that, despite their radio morphological (FR\,I $vs$ FR\,II) and/or their optical (HERG
$vs$ LERG) classification, RGs in the local Universe tend to live in galaxy-rich large-scale environments
having similar characteristics and richness. We highlight that the fraction of FR\,Is-LERG, inhabiting
galaxy rich environments, appears larger than that of FR\,IIs-LERG. We also found that 5 out of 7
FR\,II-HERGs, with $z_\mathrm{src}\leq$0.11, lie in groups/clusters of galaxies. However,
we recognize that, despite the high level of completeness of our catalogs, when restricting to the
local Universe, the low number of HERGs ($\sim$10\% of the total FR\,IIs investigated) prevent
us to make a strong statistical conclusion about this source class.
