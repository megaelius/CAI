The space-based gravitational wave detector LISA will observe mergers of massive black hole binary
systems (MBHBs) to cosmological distances, as well as inspiralling stellar-origin (or stellar-mass)
binaries (SBHBs) years before they enter the LIGO/Virgo band. Much remains to be explored for the
parameter recovery of both classes of systems. Previous MBHB analyses relied on inspiral-only
signals and/or a simplified Fisher matrix analysis, while SBHBs have not yet been extensively analyzed
with Bayesian methods. We accelerate likelihood computations by (i) using a Fourier-domain response
of the LISA instrument, (ii) using a reduced-order model for non-spinning waveforms that include
a merger-ringdown and higher harmonics, (iii) setting the noise realization to zero and computing
overlaps in the amplitude/phase representation. We present the first simulations of Bayesian
inference for the parameters of massive black hole systems including consistently the merger and
ringdown of the signal, as well as higher harmonics. We clarify the roles of LISA response time and
frequency dependencies in breaking degeneracies and illustrate how degeneracy breaking unfolds
over time. We also find that restricting the merger-dominated signal to its dominant harmonic can
make the extrinsic likelihood very degenerate. Including higher harmonics proves to be crucial
to break degeneracies and considerably improves the localization of the source, with a surviving
bimodality in the sky position. We also present simulations of Bayesian inference for the extrinsic
parameters of SBHBs, and show that although unimodal, their posterior distributions can have non-Gaussian
features.
