Stars form in supersonic turbulent molecular clouds that are self-gravitating. We present an analytic
determination of the star formation rate (SFR) in a gravoturbulent medium based on the density probability
distribution function of molecular clouds having a piecewise lognormal and power law form. This
is in contrast to previous analytic SFR models that are governed primarily by interstellar turbulence
which sets purely lognormal density PDFs. In the gravoturbulent SFR model described herein, low
density gas resides in the lognormal portion of the PDF. Gas becomes gravitationally unstable past
a critical density ($\rho_{crit}$), and the PDF begins to forms a power law. As the collapse of the
cloud proceeds, the transitional density ($\rho_t$) between the lognormal and power law portions
of the PDF moves towards lower-density while the slope of the power law ($\alpha$) becomes increasingly
shallow. The star formation rate per free-fall time is calculated via an integral over the lognormal
from $\rho_{crit}$ to $\rho_t$ and an integral over the power law from $\rho_t$ to infinity. As $\alpha$
becomes shallower the SFR increases beyond the expected values calculated from a lognormal density
PDF. We show that the star formation efficiency per free fall time in local molecular clouds increases
with shallower PDF power law slopes, in agreement with our model. The approach presented here yields
star formation rates in good agreement with both local GMCs and extragalactic observations. Our
model can explain why star formation is spatially and temporally variable within a cloud and can
accelerate and why the depletion times observed in local and extragalactic giant molecular clouds
vary. Our model can explain both star-bursting and quiescent star-forming systems without the
need to invoke extreme variations in the local interstellar environment.
