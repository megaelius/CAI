One important result from recent large integral field spectrograph (IFS) surveys is that the intrinsic
velocity dispersion of galaxies traced by star-forming gas increases with redshift. Massive,
rotation-dominated discs are already in place at z~2, but they are dynamically hotter than spiral
galaxies in the local Universe. Although several plausible mechanisms for this elevated velocity
dispersion (e.g. star formation feedback, elevated gas supply, or more frequent galaxy interactions)
have been proposed, the fundamental driver of the velocity dispersion enhancement at high redshift
remains unclear. We investigate the origin of this kinematic evolution using a suite of cosmological
simulations from the FIRE (Feedback In Realistic Environments) project. Although IFS surveys
generally cover a wider range of stellar masses than in these simulations, the simulated galaxies
show trends between intrinsic velocity dispersion, SFR, and redshift in agreement with observations.
In both the observed and simulated galaxies, intrinsic velocity dispersion is positively correlated
with SFR. Intrinsic velocity dispersion increases with redshift out to z~1 and then flattens beyond
that. In the FIRE simulations, intrinsic velocity dispersion can vary significantly on timescales
of <100 Myr. These variations closely mirror the time evolution of the SFR and gas inflow rate. By
cross-correlating pairs of intrinsic velocity dispersion, gas inflow rate, and SFR, we show that
increased gas inflow leads to subsequent enhanced star formation, and enhancements in intrinsic
velocity dispersion tend to temporally coincide with increases in gas inflow rate and SFR.
