We present stellar rotation curves and velocity dispersion profiles for 104 quiescent galaxies
at $z=0.6-1$ from the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) spectroscopic survey. Rotation
is typically probed across 10-20kpc, or to an average of 2.7${\rm R_e}$. Combined with central stellar
velocity dispersions ($\sigma_0$) this provides the first determination of the dynamical state
of a sample selected by a lack of star formation activity at large lookback time. The most massive
galaxies ($M_{\star}>2\times10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$) generally show no or little rotation measured
at 5kpc ($|V_5|/\sigma_0<0.2$ in 8 of 10 cases), while ${\sim}64\%$ of less massive galaxies show
significant rotation. This is reminiscent of local fast- and slow-rotating ellipticals and implies
that low- and high-redshift quiescent galaxies have qualitatively similar dynamical structures.
We compare $|V_5|/\sigma_0$ distributions at $z\sim0.8$ and the present day by re-binning and
smoothing the kinematic maps of 91 low-redshift quiescent galaxies from the CALIFA survey and find
evidence for a decrease in rotational support since $z\sim1$. This result is especially strong
when galaxies are compared at fixed velocity dispersion; if velocity dispersion does not evolve
for individual galaxies then the rotational velocity at 5kpc was an average of ${94\pm22\%}$ higher
in $z\sim0.8$ quiescent galaxies than today. Considering that the number of quiescent galaxies
grows with time and that new additions to the population descend from rotationally-supported star-forming
galaxies, our results imply that quiescent galaxies must lose angular momentum between $z\sim1$
and the present, presumably through dissipationless merging, and/or that the mechanism that transforms
star-forming galaxies also reduces their rotational support.
