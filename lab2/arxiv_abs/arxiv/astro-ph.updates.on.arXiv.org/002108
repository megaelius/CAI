We present the data release of the Gemini-South GMOS spectroscopy in the fields of 11 galaxy groups
at $0.8<z<1$, within the COSMOS field. This forms the basis of the Galaxy Environment Evolution
Collaboration 2 (GEEC2) project to study galaxy evolution in haloes with $M\sim 10^{13}M_\odot$
across cosmic time. The final sample includes $162$ spectroscopically--confirmed members with
$R<24.75$, and is $>50$ per cent complete for galaxies within the virial radius, and with
stellar mass $M_{\rm star}>10^{10.3}M_\odot$. Including galaxies with photometric redshifts
we have an effective sample size of $\sim 400$ galaxies within the virial radii of these groups. We
present group velocity dispersions, dynamical and stellar masses. Combining with the GCLASS sample
of more massive clusters at the same redshift we find the total stellar mass is strongly correlated
with the dynamical mass, with $\log{M_{200}}=1.20\left(\log{M_{\rm star}}-12\right)+14.07$.
This stellar fraction of $~\sim 1$ per cent is lower than predicted by some halo occupation distribution
models, though the weak dependence on halo mass is in good agreement. Most groups have an easily identifiable
most massive galaxy (MMG) near the centre of the galaxy distribution, and we present the spectroscopic
properties and surface brightness fits to these galaxies. The total stellar mass distribution
in the groups, excluding the MMG, compares well with an NFW profile with concentration $4$, for galaxies
beyond $\sim 0.2R_{200}$. This is more concentrated than the number density distribution, demonstrating
that there is some mass segregation.
