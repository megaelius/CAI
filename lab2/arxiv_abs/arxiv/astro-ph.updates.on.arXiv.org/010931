We present limits on the 21cm power spectrum from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) using data from
the 64 antenna configuration of the Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization
(PAPER) analyzed through a power spectrum pipeline independent from previous PAPER analyses.
Previously reported results from PAPER have been found to contain significant signal loss (Cheng
et al. 2018, arxiv:1810.05175). Several lossy steps from previous PAPER pipelines have not been
included in this analysis, namely: delay-based foreground filtering, optimal fringe-rate filtering,
and empirical covariance-based estimators. Steps which remain in common with previous analyses
include redundant calibration and local sidereal time (LST) binning. The power spectra reported
here are effectively the result of applying a linear Fourier transform analysis to the calibrated,
LST binned data. This analysis also uses more data than previous publications, including the complete
available redshift range of $z \sim 7.5$ to $11$. In previous PAPER analyses, many power spectrum
measurements were found to be detections of noncosmological power at levels of significance ranging
from two to hundreds of times the theoretical noise. Here, excess power is examined using redundancy
between baselines and power spectrum jackknives. The upper limits we find on the 21cm power spectrum
from reionization are ($1500$ mK)$^{2}$, ($1900$ mK)$^{2}$, ($280$ mK)$^{2}$, ($200$ mK)$^{2}$,
($380$ mK)$^{2}$, ($300$ mK)$^{2}$ at redshifts $z=10.87,\ 9.93,\ 8.68,\ 8.37,\ 8.13,$ and $7.48$,
respectively. For reasons described in Cheng et al. 2018 (arxiv:1810.05175), these limits supersede
all previous PAPER results (Ali et al. 2018, arxiv:1502.06016).
