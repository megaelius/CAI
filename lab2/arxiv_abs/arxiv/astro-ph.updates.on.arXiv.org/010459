Extragalactic peaked-spectrum radio sources are thought to be the progenitors of larger, radio-loud
active galactic nuclei (AGN). Synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) has often been identified as
the cause of their spectral peak. The identification of new megahertz-peaked spectrum sources
from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey provides
an opportunity to test how radio sources with spectral peaks below 1 GHz fit within this evolutionary
picture. We observed six peaked-spectrum sources selected from the GLEAM survey, three that have
spectral characteristics which violate SSA and three that have spectral peaks below 230 MHz, with
the Very Long Baseline Array at 1.55 and 4.96 GHz. We present milliarcsecond resolution images of
each source and constrain their morphology, linear size, luminosity, and magnetic field strength.
Of the sources that are resolved by our study, the sources that violate SSA appear to be compact doubles,
while the sources with peak frequencies below 230 MHz have core-jet features. We find that all of
our sources are smaller than expected from SSA by factors of >20. We also find that component magnetic
field strengths calculated from SSA are likely inaccurate, differing by factors of >5 from equipartition
estimates. The calculated equipartition magnetic field strengths more closely resemble estimates
from previously studied gigahertz-peaked spectrum sources. Exploring a model of the interaction
between jets and the interstellar medium, we demonstrate that free-free absorption (FFA) can accurately
describe the linear sizes and peak frequencies of our sources. Our findings support the theory that
there is a fraction of peaked-spectrum sources whose spectral peaks are best modelled by FFA, implying
our understanding of the early stages of radio AGN is incomplete.
