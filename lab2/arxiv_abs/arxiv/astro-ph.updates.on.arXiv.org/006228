Evolutionary models are widely used to infer the mass of stars, brown dwarfs, and giant planets.
Their predictions are thought to be less reliable at young ages ($<$ 200 Myr) and in the low-mass regime
($\mathrm{<1~M_{\odot}}$). GJ 2060 AB and TWA 22 AB are two rare astrometric M-dwarf binaries respectively
members of the AB Doradus and Beta Pictoris moving groups. As their dynamical mass can be measured
within a few years, they can be used to calibrate the evolutionary tracks and set new constraints
on the age of young moving groups. We find a total mass of $\mathrm{0.18\pm 0.02~M_\odot}$ for TWA
22. That mass is in good agreement with model predictions at the age of the Beta Pic moving group. We
obtain a total mass of $\mathrm{1.09 \pm 0.10~M_{\odot}}$ for GJ 2060. We estimate a spectral type
of M$1\pm0.5$, $\mathrm{L/L_{\odot}=-1.20\pm0.05}$ dex, and $\mathrm{T_{eff}=3700\pm100}$
K for GJ 2060 A. The B component is a M$3\pm0.5$ dwarf with $\mathrm{L/L_{\odot}=-1.63\pm0.05}$
dex and $\mathrm{T_{eff}=3400\pm100}$ K. The dynamical mass of GJ 2060 AB is inconsistent with
the most recent models predictions (BCAH15, PARSEC) for an ABDor age in the range 50-150 Myr. It is
10 to 20\% (1-2 sigma, depending on the assumed age) above the models predictions, corresponding
to an underestimation of $0.10$ to $0.20~\mathrm{M_\odot}$. Coevality suggests a young age for
the system ($\sim$ 50 Myr) according to most evolutionary models. TWA 22 validates the predictions
of recent evolutionary tracks at $\sim$20 Myr. On the other hand, we evidence a 1-2 sigma mismatch
between the predicted and observed mass of GJ 2060 AB. This slight departure may indicate that one
of the star hosts a tight companion. Alternatively, this would confirm the models tendency to underestimate
the mass of young low-mass stars.
