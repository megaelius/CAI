Precessing black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) binaries produce a rich gravitational wave signal,
encoding the binary's nature and inspiral kinematics. Using the lalinference\_mcmc Markov-chain
Monte Carlo parameter estimation code, we use two fiducial examples to illustrate how the geometry
and kinematics are encoded into the modulated gravitational wave signal, using coordinates well-adapted
to precession. Even for precessing binaries, we show the performance of detailed parameter estimation
can be estimated by "effective" estimates: comparisons of a prototype signal with its nearest neighbors,
adopting a fixed sky location and idealized two-detector network. We use detailed and effective
approaches to show higher harmonics provide nonzero but small local improvement when estimating
the parameters of precessing BH-NS binaries. That said, we show higher harmonics can improve parameter
estimation accuracy for precessing binaries ruling out approximately-degenerate source orientations.
Our work illustrates quantities gravitational wave measurements can provide, such as reliable
component masses and the precise orientation of a precessing short gamma ray burst progenitor relative
to the line of sight. "Effective" estimates may provide a simple way to estimate trends in the performance
of parameter estimation for generic precessing BH-NS binaries in next-generation detectors.
For example, our results suggest that the orbital chirp rate, precession rate, and precession geometry
are roughly-independent observables, defining natural variables to organize correlations in
the high-dimensional BH-NS binary parameter space.
