We use the age-metallicity distribution of 96 Galactic globular clusters (GCs) to infer the formation
and assembly history of the Milky Way (MW), culminating in the reconstruction of its merger tree.
Based on a quantitative comparison of the Galactic GC population to the 25 cosmological zoom-in
simulations of MW-mass galaxies in the E-MOSAICS project, which self-consistently model the formation
and evolution of GC populations in a cosmological context, we find that the MW assembled quickly
for its mass, reaching $\{25,50\}\%$ of its present-day halo mass already at $z=\{3,1.5\}$ and
half of its present-day stellar mass at $z=1.2$. We reconstruct the MW's merger tree from its GC age-metallicity
distribution, inferring the number of mergers as a function of mass ratio and redshift. These statistics
place the MW's assembly $\textit{rate}$ among the 72th-94th percentile of the E-MOSAICS galaxies,
whereas its $\textit{integrated}$ properties (e.g. number of mergers, halo concentration) match
the median of the simulations. We conclude that the MW has experienced no major mergers (mass ratios
$>$1:4) since $z\sim4$, sharpening previous limits of $z\sim2$. We identify three massive satellite
progenitors and constrain their mass growth and enrichment histories. Two are proposed to correspond
to Sagittarius (few $10^8~{\rm M}_\odot$) and Canis Major ($\sim10^9~{\rm M}_\odot$). The third
satellite has no known associated relic and was likely accreted between $z=0.6$-$1.3$. We name
this enigmatic galaxy $\textit{Kraken}$ and propose that it is the most massive satellite ($M_*\sim2\times10^9~{\rm
M}_\odot$) ever accreted by the MW. We predict that $\sim40\%$ of the Galactic GCs formed ex-situ
(in galaxies with masses $M_*=2\times10^7$-$2\times10^9~{\rm M}_\odot$), with $6\pm1$ being
former nuclear clusters.
