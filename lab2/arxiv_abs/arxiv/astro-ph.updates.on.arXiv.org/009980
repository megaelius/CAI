We report observations and analysis of the nearby gamma-ray burst GRB\,161219B (redshift $z=0.1475$)
and the associated Type Ic supernova (SN) 2016jca. GRB\,161219B had an isotropic gamma-ray energy
of $\sim 1.6 \times 10^{50}$\,erg. Its afterglow is likely refreshed at an epoch preceding the first
photometric points (0.6\,d), which slows down the decay rates. Combined analysis of the SN light
curve and multiwavelength observations of the afterglow suggest that the GRB jet was broad during
the afterglow phase (full opening angle $\sim 42^\circ \pm 3^\circ$). Our spectral series shows
broad absorption lines typical of GRB supernovae (SNe), which testify to the presence of material
with velocities up to $\sim 0.25$c. The spectrum at 3.73\,d allows for the very early identification
of a SN associated with a GRB. Reproducing it requires a large photospheric velocity ($35,000 \pm
7000$\,\kms). The kinetic energy of the SN is estimated through models to be \KE $\approx 4 \times
10^{52}$\,erg in spherical symmetry. The ejected mass in the explosion was \Mej $\approx 6.5 \pm
1.5$\,\Msun, much less than that of other GRB-SNe, demonstrating diversity among these events.
The total amount of \Nifs\ in the explosion was $0.27 \pm 0.05$\,\Msun. The observed spectra require
the presence of freshly synthesised \Nifs\ at the highest velocities, at least 3 times more than
a standard GRB-SN. We also find evidence for a decreasing \Nifs\ abundance as a function of decreasing
velocity. This suggests that SN\,2016jca was a highly aspherical explosion viewed close to on-axis,
powered by a compact remnant. Applying a typical correction for asymmetry, the energy of SN\,2016jca
was $\sim$ (1--3) $\times 10^{52}$\,erg, confirming that most of the energy produced by GRB-SNe
goes into the kinetic energy of the SN ejecta.
