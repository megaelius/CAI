Context. Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on the Sun are the largest explosions in the Solar System
that can drive powerful plasma shocks. The eruptions, shocks, and other processes associated to
CMEs are efficient particle accelerators and the accelerated electrons in particular can produce
radio bursts through the plasma emission mechanism. Aims. Coronal mass ejections and associated
radio bursts have been well studied in cases where the CME originates close to the solar limb or within
the frontside disc. Here, we study the radio emission associated with a CME eruption on the back side
of the Sun on 22 July 2012. Methods. Using radio imaging from the Nan\c{c}ay Radioheliograph, spectroscopic
data from the Nan\c{c}ay Decametric Array, and extreme-ultraviolet observations from the Solar
Dynamics Observatory and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory spacecraft, we determine the
nature of the observed radio emission as well as the location and propagation of the CME. Results.
We show that the observed low-intensity radio emission corresponds to a type II radio burst or a short-duration
type IV radio burst associated with a CME eruption due to breakout reconnection on the back side of
the Sun, as suggested by the pre-eruptive magnetic field configuration. The radio emission consists
of a large, extended structure, initially located ahead of the CME, that corresponds to various
electron acceleration locations. Conclusions. The observations presented here are consistent
with the breakout model of CME eruptions. The extended radio emission coincides with the location
of the current sheet and quasi-separatrix boundary of the CME flux and the overlying helmet streamer
and also with that of a large shock expected to form ahead of the CME in this configuration.
