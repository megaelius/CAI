A Kepler solver is an analytical method to solve a pure two-body problem. By slightly modifying the
Kepler solver, we develop a new manifold correction method. Only one change to the analytical solution
lies in that the obtainment of the eccentric anomaly does not need any iteration but uses the true
anomaly between the constant Laplace-Runge-Lenz (LRL) vector and a varying radial vector given
by an integrator. Such a new method rigorously conserves seven integrals of the Kepler energy, angular
momentum vector and LRL vector. This leads to the numerical conservation of all orbital elements
except the mean longitude. In the construction mechanism, the new method is unlike the existing
Fukushima's linear transformation method that satisfies these properties. It can be extend to
treat quasi-Keplerian orbits in perturbed two-body or N-body problems. The five slowly-varying
orbital elements of each body relative to the central body are determined by the seven quasi-conserved
quantities from their integral invariant relations, and the eccentric anomaly is calculated similarly
in the above way. Substituting these values into the Kepler solver yields an adjusted solution of
each body. Taking a post-Newtonian two-body problem and a six-body system of the Sun, four outer
planets and Pluto as examples of quasi-Keplerian motions, we show that the new method can significantly
improve the accuracies of all the orbital elements and the positions of individual planets, as compared
with the case without correction. The new method and the Fukushima's method are almost the same in
the numerical performance and need small additional computational cost.
