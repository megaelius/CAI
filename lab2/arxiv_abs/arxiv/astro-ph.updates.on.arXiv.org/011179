Impulsive solar energetic particle events are widely believed to be due to the prompt escape into
the interplanetary medium of flare-accelerated particles produced by solar eruptive events.
According to the standard model for such events, however, particles accelerated by the flare reconnection
should remain trapped in the flux rope comprising the coronal mass ejection. The particles should
reach the Earth only much later, along with the bulk ejecta. To resolve this paradox, we have extended
our previous axisymmetric model for the escape of flare-accelerated particles to fully three-dimensional
(3D) geometries. We report the results of magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a coronal system
that consists of a bipolar active region embedded in a background global dipole field structured
by solar wind. Our simulations show that multiple magnetic reconnection episodes occur prior to
and during the CME eruption and its interplanetary propagation. In addition to the episodes that
build up the flux rope, reconnection between the open field and the CME couples the closed corona
to the open interplanetary field. Flare-accelerated particles initially trapped in the CME thereby
gain access to the open interplanetary field along a trail blazed by magnetic reconnection. A key
difference between these 3D results and our previous calculations is that the interchange reconnection
allows accelerated particles to escape from deep within the CME flux-rope. We estimate the spatial
extent of the particle-escape channels. The relative timings between flare acceleration and release
of the energetic particles through CME/open-field coupling are also determined. All our results
compare favourably with observations.
