Several recent studies have shown that very wide binary stars can potentially provide an interesting
test for modified-gravity theories which attempt to emulate dark matter; these systems should
be almost Newtonian according to standard dark-matter theories, while the predictions for MOND-like
theories are distinctly different, if the various observational issues can be overcome. Here we
explore an observational application of the test from the recent GAIA DR2 data release: we select
a large sample of $\sim 24,000$ candidate wide binary stars with distance $< 200$ parsec and magnitudes
$G < 16$ from GAIA DR2, and estimated component masses using a main-sequence mass-luminosity relation.
We then compare the frequency distribution of pairwise relative projected velocity (relative
to circular-orbit value) as a function of projected separation; these distributions show a clear
peak at a value close to Newtonian expectations, along with a long `tail' which extends to much larger
velocity ratios; the `tail' is considerably more numerous than in control samples constructed
from DR2 with randomised positions, so its origin is unclear. Comparing the velocity histograms
with simulated data, we conclude that MOND-like theories without an external field effect are strongly
inconsistent with the observed data since they predict a peak-shift in clear disagreement with
the data; testing MOND-like theories with an external field effect is not decisive at present, but
has good prospects to become decisive in future with improved modelling or understanding of the
high-velocity tail, and additional spectroscopic data.
