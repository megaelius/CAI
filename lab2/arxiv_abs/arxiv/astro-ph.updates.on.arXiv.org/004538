Unlike young open clusters (with ages <250 Myr), the Hyades cluster (age ~600 Myr) has a clear deficit
of very low-mass stars (VLM) and brown dwarfs (BD). Since this open cluster has a low stellar density
and covers several tens of square degrees on the sky, extended surveys are required to improve the
statistics of the VLM/BD objects in the cluster. We search for new VLM stars and BD candidates in the
Hyades to improve the present-day cluster mass function down to substellar masses. An imaging survey
of the Hyades with a completeness limit of 21m.5 in the $R$ band and 20m.5 in the $I$ band was carried
out with the 2kx2k CCD Schmidt camera at the 2m Alfred Jensch Telescope in Tautenburg. We performed
a photometric selection of the cluster member candidates by combining results of our survey with
2MASS JHKs photometry. We present a photometric and proper motion survey covering 23.4 deg$^2$
in the Hyades cluster core region. Using optical/IR colour-magnitude diagrams, we identify 66
photometric cluster member candidates in the magnitude range 14m.7<I<20m.5. The proper motion
measurements are based on several all-sky surveys with an epoch difference of 60-70 years for the
bright objects. The proper motions allowed us to discriminate the cluster members from field objects
and resulted in 14 proper motion members of the Hyades. We rediscover Hy 6 as a proper motion member
and classify it as a substellar object candidate (BD) based on the comparison of the observed colour-magnitude
diagram with theoretical model isochrones. With our results, the mass function of the Hyades continues
to be shallow below 0.15 $M_\odot$ indicating that the Hyades have probably lost their lowest mass
members by means of dynamical evolution. We conclude that the Hyades core represents the `VLM/BD
desert' and that most of the substeller objects may have already left the volume of the cluster.
