Context. Interest in the use of the Chajnantor area for millimeter and submillimeter astronomy
is increasing because of its excellent atmospheric conditions. Knowing the general site annual
variability in precipitable water vapor (PWV) can contribute to the planning of new observatories
in the area. Aims. We seek to create a 20-year atmospheric database (1997 - 2017) for the Chajnantor
area in northern Chile using a single common physical unit, PWV.We plan to extract weather relations
between the Chajnantor Plateau and the summit of Cerro Chajnantor to evaluate potential sensitivity
improvements for telescopes fielded in the higher site. We aim to validate the use of submillimeter
tippers to be used at other sites and use the PWV database to detect a potential signature for local
climate change over 20 years. Methods. We revised our method to convert from submillimeter tipper
opacity to PWV. We now include the ground temperature as an input parameter to the conversion scheme
and, therefore, achieve a higher conversion accuracy. Results.We found a decrease in the measured
PWV at the summit of Cerro Chajnantor with respect to the plateau of 28%. In addition, we found a PWV
difference of 1:9% with only 27 m of altitude difference between two sites in the Chajnantor Plateau:
the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) and the Cosmic Background Imager (CBI) near the Atacama
Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) center. This difference is possibly due to local topographic conditions
that favor the discrepancy in PWV. The scale height for the plateau was extracted from the measurements
of the plateau and the Cerro Chajnantor summit, giving a value of 1537 m. Considering the results
obtained in this work from the long-term study, we do not see evidence of PWV trends in the 20-year
period of the analysis that would suggest climate change in such a timescale.
