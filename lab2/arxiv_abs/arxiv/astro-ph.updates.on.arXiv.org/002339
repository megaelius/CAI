The imaging sharpness of an X-ray telescope is chiefly determined by the optical quality of its focusing
optics, which in turn mostly depends on the shape accuracy and the surface finishing of the grazing
incidence X-ray mirrors that compose the optical modules. In order to ensure the imaging performance
during the mirror manufacturing, a fundamental step is represented by the prediction of the mirror
Point Spread Function (PSF) from the metrology of its surface. Traditionally, the PSF computation
in X-rays is assumed to be different depending on whether the surface defects are classified as figure
errors or roughness [...] The aim of this work is to overcome this limit, providing analytical formulae,
valid at any light wavelength, to compute the PSF of an X-ray mirror shell from the measured longitudinal
profiles and the roughness Power Spectral Density (PSD), without distinguishing spectral ranges
with different treatments. The method we adopted is based on the Huygens-Fresnel principle to compute
the diffracted intensity from measured or modeled profiles. In particular, we have simplified
the computation of the surface integral to only one dimension, owing to the grazing incidence that
reduces the influence of the azimuthal errors by orders of magnitude. The method can be extended
to optical systems with an arbitrary number of reflections - in particular the Wolter-I, of frequent
use in X-ray astronomy - and can be used in both near- and far-field approximation. Finally, it accounts
simultaneously for profile, roughness, and aperture diffraction. In this paper we expose the formalism
to self-consistently compute the PSF of grazing-incidence mirrors, [...]. Finally, we show a validation
by comparing the simulated PSF of a real Wolter-I mirror shell with the measured one in hard X-rays.
