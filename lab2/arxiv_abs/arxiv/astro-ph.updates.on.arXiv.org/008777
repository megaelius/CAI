We study a general relativistic gravitomagnetic 3-body effect induced by the spin angular momentum
${\boldsymbol S}_\textrm{X}$ of a rotating mass $M_\textrm{X}$ orbited at distance $r_\textrm{X}$
by a local gravitationally bound restricted two-body system $\mathcal{S}$ of size $r\ll r_\textrm{X}$
consisting of a test particle revolving around a massive body $M$. At the lowest post-Newtonian
order, we analytically work out the doubly averaged rates of change of the Keplerian orbital elements
of the test particle by finding non-vanishing long-term effects for the inclination $I$, the node
$\Omega$ and the pericenter $\omega$. Such theoretical results are confirmed by a numerical integration
of the equations of motion for a fictitious 3-body system. We numerically calculate the magnitudes
of the post-Newtonian gravitomagnetic 3-body precessions for some astronomical scenarios in
our solar system. For putative man-made orbiters of the natural moons Enceladus and Europa in the
external fields of Saturn and Jupiter, the relativistic precessions due to the angular momenta
of the gaseous giant planets can be as large as $\simeq 10-50~\textrm{milliarcseconds~per~year}~\left(\textrm{mas~yr}^{-1}\right)$.
A preliminary numerical simulation shows that, for certain orbital configurations of a hypothetical
Europa orbiter, its range-rate signal $\Delta\dot\rho$ can become larger than the current Doppler
accuracy of the existing spacecraft Juno at Jupiter, i.e. $\sigma_{\dot\rho}=0.015~\textrm{mm~s}^{-1}$,
after 1 d. The effects induced by the Sun's angular momentum on artificial probes of Mercury and the
Earth are at the level of $\simeq 1-0.1~\textrm{microarcseconds~per~year}~\left(\mu\textrm{as~yr}^{-1}\right)$.
