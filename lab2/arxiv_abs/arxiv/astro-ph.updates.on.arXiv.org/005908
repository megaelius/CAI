Thanks to its spatial resolution the ESA/Gaia space mission offers a unique opportunity to discover
new multiply-imaged quasars and to study the already known lensed systems at sub-milliarcsecond
astrometric precisions. In this paper, we address the detection of the known multiply-imaged quasars
from the Gaia Data Release 2 and determine the astrometric and photometric properties of the individually
detected images found in the Gaia DR2 catalogue. We have compiled an exhaustive list of quasar gravitational
lenses from the literature to search for counterparts in the Gaia Data Release 2. We then analyze
the astrometric and photometric properties of these Gaia's detections. To highlight the tremendous
potential of Gaia at the sub-milliarcsecond level we finally perform a simple Bayesian modeling
of the well-known gravitational lens system HE0435-1223, using Gaia Data Release 2 and HST astrometry.
From 478 known multiply imaged quasars, 200 have at least one image found in the Gaia Data Release
2. Among the 41 known quadruply-imaged quasars of the list, 26 have at least one image in the Gaia Data
Release 2, 12 of which are fully detected, 6 have three counterparts, 7 have two and 1 has only one.
As expected, the modeling of HE0435-1223 shows that the model parameters are significantly better
constrained when using Gaia astrometry compared to HST astrometry, in particular the relative
positions of the background quasar source and the centroid of the deflector. The Gaia sub-milliarcsecond
astrometry also significantly reduces the parameter correlations. Besides providing an up-to-date
list of multiply imaged quasars and their detection in the Gaia DR2, this paper shows that more complex
modeling scenarios will certainly benefit from Gaia sub-milliarcsecond astrometry.
