The well-known cluster of galaxies ZwCl0024+1652 at z $\sim$ 0.4, lacks an in-depth morphological
classification of its central region. While previous studies provide a visual classification
of a patched area, we used the public code called galaxy Support Vector Machine (galSVM) and HST/ACS
data as well as WFP2 master catalogue to automatically classify all cluster members up to 1 Mpc. galSVM
analyses galaxy morphologies through Support Vector Machine (SVM). From the 231 cluster galaxies,
we classified 97 as early-types (ET) and 83 as late-types (LT). The remaining 51 stayed unclassified
(or undecided, UD). By cross-matching our results with the existing visual classification, we
found an agreement of 81%. In addition to previous Zwcl0024 morphological classifications, 121
of our galaxies were classified for the first time in this work. In addition, we tested the location
of classified galaxies on the standard morphological diagrams, colour-colour and colour-magnitude
diagrams. Out of all cluster members, $\sim$20% are emission line galaxies (ELG), taking into account
previous GLACE results. We have verified that the ET fraction is slightly higher near the cluster
core and decreases with the clustercentric distance, while the opposite trend has been observed
for LT galaxies. We found higher fraction of ET (54%) than LT (46%) throughout the analysed central
region, as expected. In addition, we analysed the correlation between the five morphological parameters
(Abraham concentration, Bershady-Concelice concentration, Asymmetry, Gini and M20 moment of
light) and clustercentric distance, without finding a clear trend. Finally, as a result of our work,
the morphological catalogue of 231 galaxies containing all the measured parameters and the final
classification is available in the electronic form of this paper.
