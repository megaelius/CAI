Adaptive optics (AO) system performance is improved using post-processing techniques, such as
point spread function (PSF) deconvolution. The PSF estimation involves characterization of the
different wavefront (WF) error sources in the AO system. We propose a numerical error breakdown
estimation tool that allows studying AO error source behavior such as their correlations. We also
propose a new analytical model for anisoplanatism and bandwidth errors that were validated with
the error breakdown estimation tool. This model is the first step for a complete AO residual error
model that is expressed in deformable mirror space, leading to practical usage such as PSF reconstruction
or turbulent parameters identification. We have developed in the computing platform for adaptive
optics systems (COMPASS) code, which is an end-to-end simulation code using graphics processing
units (GPU) acceleration, an estimation tool that provides a comprehensive error breakdown by
the outputs of a single simulation run. We derive the various contributors from the end-to-end simulator
at each iteration step: this method provides temporal buffers of each contributor. Then, we use
this tool to validate a new model of anisoplanatism and bandwidth errors including their correlation.
This model is based on a statistical approach that computes the error covariance matrices using
structure functions. A correlation analysis shows significant correlations between some contributors,
especially WF measurement deviation error and bandwidth error due to centroid gain, and the well-known
correlation between bandwidth and anisoplanatism errors is also retrieved. The model we propose
for the two latter errors shows an SR and EE difference of about one percent compared to the end-to-end
simulation, even if some approximations exist.
