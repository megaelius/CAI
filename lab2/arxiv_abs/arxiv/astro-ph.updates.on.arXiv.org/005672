A critical bottleneck for stellar astrophysics and exoplanet science using data from the $Kepler$
mission has been the lack of precise radii and evolutionary states of the observed target stars.
Here we present revised radii of 186,813 $Kepler$ stars derived by combining parallaxes from $Gaia$
Data Release 2 with the DR25 $Kepler$ Stellar Properties Catalog. The median radius precision is
$\approx$8%, a factor 4-5 improvement over previous estimates for typical $Kepler$ stars. We find
that $\approx$65% ($\approx$ 128,000) of all $Kepler$ targets are main-sequence stars, $\approx$23%
($\approx$ 40,600) are subgiants, and $\approx$12% ($\approx$ 23,000) are red giants, demonstrating
that subgiant contamination is less severe than previously thought and that the $Kepler$ parent
population mostly consists of unevolved main-sequence stars. Using the revised stellar radii,
we recalculate the radii for 2218 confirmed and 1958 candidate exoplanets. Our results confirm
the presence of a gap in the radius distribution of small, close-in planets, but yield evidence that
the gap is mostly limited to incident fluxes $>$200$F_\oplus$ and may be located closer to 2$R_\oplus$.
We furthermore find several confirmed exoplanets which occupy the "hot super-Earth desert", detect
direct evidence for a correlation of gas-giant planet inflation with increasing incident flux,
and establish a bona-fide sample of 8 confirmed planets and 34 planet candidates with $< 2 R_\oplus$
in the habitable zone. The results presented here demonstrate the enormous potential for the precise
characterization of stellar and exoplanet populations using the transformational dataset provided
by $Gaia$.
