Almost all planetary atmospheres are affected by disequilibrium chemical processes. In this paper
we introduce our recently developed Chemical Kinetic Model (\texttt{ChemKM}). We show that the
results of our HD189733b model are in good agreement with previously published results, except
at $\mu$bar regime, where molecular diffusion and photochemistry are the dominant processes.
We thus recommend careful consideration of these processes when abundances at the top of the atmosphere
are desired. We also propose a new metric for a quantitative measure of quenching levels. By applying
this metric, we find that quenching pressure decreases with the effective temperature of planets,
but it also varies significantly with other atmospheric parameters such as [Fe/H], log(g), and
C/O. In addition, we find that the "Methane Valley", a region between 800 and 1500K where above a certain
C/O threshold value a greater chance of CH$_4$ detection is expected, still exists after including
the vertical mixing. The first robust CH$_4$ detection on an irradiated planet (HD102195b) places
this object within this region; supporting our prediction. We also investigate the detectability
of disequilibrium spectral fingerprints by JWST, and suggest focusing on the targets with T$_{eff}$
between 1000 and 1800K, orbiting around M-dwarfs, having low surface gravity but high metallicity
and a C/O ratio value around unity. Finally, constructing Spitzer color-maps suggests that the
main two color-populations are largely insensitive to the vertical mixing. Therefore any deviation
of observational points from these populations are likely due to the presence of clouds and not disequilibrium
processes. However, some cold planets (T$_{eff}<$900K) with very low C/O ratios ($<$0.25) show
significant deviations; making these planets interesting cases for further investigation.
