The relation between the mass and integrated electron pressure of galaxy group and cluster halos
can be probed by stacking maps of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. Perhaps surprisingly,
recent observational results have indicated that the scaling relation between integrated pressure
and mass follows the prediction of simple, self-similar models down to halo masses as low as $10^{12.5}
\, M_{\odot}$. Hydrodynamical simulations that incorporate energetic feedback processes suggest
that gas should be depleted from such low-mass halos, thus decreasing their tSZ signal relative
to self-similar predictions. Here, we build on the modeling of Vikram, Lidz, and Jain (2017) to evaluate
the bias in the interpretation of stacked tSZ measurements due to the signal from correlated halos
(the "two-halo" term), which has generally been neglected in the literature. We fit theoretical
models to a measurement of the tSZ -- galaxy group cross-correlation function, accounting explicitly
for the one- and two- halo contributions. We find moderate evidence of a deviation from self-similarity
in the pressure -- mass relation, even after marginalizing over conservative miscentering effects.
We explore pressure -- mass models with a break at $10^{14} \, M_{\odot}$, as well as other variants.
We discuss and test for sources of uncertainty in our analysis, in particular a possible bias in the
halo mass estimates and the coarse resolution of the Planck beam. We compare our findings with earlier
analyses by exploring the extent to which halo isolation criteria can reduce the two-halo contribution.
Finally, we show that ongoing third-generation CMB experiments will explicitly resolve the one-halo
term in low-mass groups; our methodology can be applied to these upcoming data sets to obtain a clear
answer to the question of self-similarity and an improved understanding of hot gas in low-mass halos.
