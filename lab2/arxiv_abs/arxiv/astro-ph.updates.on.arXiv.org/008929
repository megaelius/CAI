The tomographic Alcock-Paczynski (AP) test is a robust large-scale structure (LSS) measurement
that receives little contamination from the redshift space distortion (RSD). It has placed tight
cosmological constraints by using small and intermediate clustering scales of the LSS data. However,
previous works have neglected the cross-correlation among different redshift bins, which could
cause the statistical uncertainty being underestimated by $\sim$20\%. In this work, we further
improve this method by including this multi-redshifts full correlation. We apply it to the SDSS
DR12 galaxies sample and find out that, for $\Lambda$CDM, the combination of AP with the Planck+BAO
dataset slightly reduces (within 1-$\sigma$) $\Omega_m$ to $0.304\pm0.007$ (68.3\% CL). This
then leads to a larger $H_0$ and also mildly affects $\Omega_b h^2$, $n_s$ and the derived parameters
$z_*$, $r_*$, $z_{re}$ but not $\tau$, $A_s$ and $\sigma_8$. For the flat $w$CDM model, our measurement
gives $\Omega_m=0.301\pm 0.010$ and $w=-1.090\pm 0.047$, where the additional AP measurement
reduces the error budget by $\sim 25\%$. When including more parameters into the analysis, the AP
method also improves the constraints on $\Omega_k$, $\sum m_\mu$, $N_{\rm eff}$ by $20-30\%$.
Early universe parameters such as $dn_s/d{\rm ln}k$ and $r$, however, are unaffected. Assuming
the dark energy equation of state $w=w_0+w_a \frac{z}{1+z}$, the Planck+BAO+SNIa+$H_0$+AP datasets
prefer a dynamical dark energy at $\approx1.5 \sigma$ CL. Finally, we forecast the cosmological
constraints expected from the DESI galaxy survey and find that combining AP with CMB+BAO method
would improve the $w_0$-$w_a$ constraint by a factor of $\sim 10$.
