We present a comprehensive catalog of cool (period $P\gtrsim 2\,\mathrm{yr}$) transiting planet
candidates in the four-year light curves from the prime \kepler\ mission. Most of the candidates
show only one or two transits and have largely been missed in the original Kepler Object of Interest
catalog. Our catalog is based on all known such candidates in the literature as well as new candidates
from the search in this paper, and provides a resource to explore the planet population near the snow
line of Sun-like stars. We homogeneously performed pixel-level vetting, stellar characterization
with GAIA parallax and archival/Subaru spectroscopy, and light-curve modeling to derive planet
parameters and to eliminate stellar binaries. The resulting clean sample consists of 67 planet
candidates whose radii are typically constrained to 5\%, in which 23 are newly reported. The number
of Jupiter-sized candidates (29 with $r>8\,R_\oplus$) in the sample is consistent with the Doppler
occurrence. The smaller candidates are more prevalent (23 with $4<r/R_\oplus<8$, 15 with $r/R_\oplus<4$)
and suggest that long-period Neptune-sized planets are at least as common as the Jupiter-sized
ones, although our sample is yet to be corrected for detection completeness. If the sample is assumed
to be complete, these numbers imply the occurrence rate of $0.39\pm0.07$ planets with $4<r/R_\oplus<14$
and $2<P/\mathrm{yr}<20$ per FGK dwarf. The stars hosting candidates with $r>4\,R_\oplus$ have
systematically higher [Fe/H] than the Kepler field stars, providing evidence that giant planet--metallicity
correlation extends to $P>2\,\mathrm{yr}$.
