The structure and kinematics of the broad line region (BLR) in quasars are still not well established.
One popular BLR model is the disk-wind model that offers a geometric unification of a quasar based
on the angle of viewing. We construct a simple kinematical disk-wind model with a narrow outflowing
wind angle. The model is combined with radiative transfer in the Sobolev, or high velocity, limit.
We examine how angle of viewing affects the observed characteristics of the emission line, especially
the line widths and velocity offsets. The line profiles exhibit distinct properties depending
on the orientation, wind opening angle, and region of the wind where the emission arises. At low inclination
angle (close to face-on), we find the shape of the emission line is asymmetric with narrow width and
significantly blueshifted. As the inclination angle increases (close to edge-on), the line profile
becomes more symmetric, broader, and less blueshifted. Additionally, lines that arise close to
the base of the disk wind, near the accretion disk, tend to be broad and symmetric. The relative increase
in blueshift of the emission line with increasing wind vertical distance is larger for polar winds
compared with equatorial winds. By considering the optical thickness of the wind, single-peaked
line profiles are recovered for the intermediate and equatorial outflowing wind. The model is able
to reproduce a faster response in either the red and blue sides of the line profile found in reverberation
mapping studies. A quicker response in the red side is achieved in the model with a polar wind and intermediate
wind opening angle at low viewing angle. The blue side response is faster for an equatorial wind seen
at high inclination.
