Background: Nuclear pasta, emerging due to the competition between the long-range Coulomb force
and the short-range strong force, is believed to be present in astrophysical scenarios, such as
neutron stars and core-collapse supernovae. Its structure can have a high impact e.g. on neutrino
transport or the tidal deformability of neutron stars. Purpose: We study several possible pasta
configurations, all of them minimal surface configurations, which are expected to appear in the
mid-density regime of nuclear pasta, i.e. around 40% of the nuclear saturation density. In particular
we are interested in the energy spectrum for different pasta configurations considered. Method:
Employing the density functional theory (DFT) approach, we calculate the binding energy of the
different configurations for three values of the proton content XP = 1/10, 1/3 and 1/2, by optimizing
their periodic length. We study finite temperature effects and the impact of electron screening.
Results: Nuclear pasta lowers the energy significantly compared to uniform matter, especially
for $X_P \geq 1/3$. However, the different configurations have very similar binding energies.
For large proton content, $X_P \geq 1/3$, the pasta configurations are very stable, for lower proton
content temperatures of a few MeV are enough for the transition to uniform matter. Electron screening
has a small influence on the binding energy of nuclear pasta, but increases its periodic length.
Conclusion: Nuclear pasta in the mid-density regime lowers the energy of the matter for all proton
fractions under study. It can survive even large temperatures of several MeV. Since various configurations
have very similar energy, it is to expected that many configurations can coexist simultaneously
already at small temperatures.
