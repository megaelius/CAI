We investigate satellite orbital drag effects at low-Earth orbit (LEO) associated with thermosphere
heating during magnetic storms caused by coronal mass ejections. CHAllenge Mini-satellite Payload
(CHAMP) and Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) neutral density data are used to compute
orbital drag. Storm-to-quiet density comparisons are performed with background densities obtained
by the Jacchia-Bowman 2008 (JB2008) empirical model. Our storms are grouped in different categories
regarding their intensities as indicated by minimum values of the SYM-H index. We then perform superposed
epoch analyses with storm main phase onset as zero epoch time. In general, we find that orbital drag
effects are larger for CHAMP (lower altitudes) in comparison to GRACE (higher altitudes). Results
show that storm-time drag effects manifest first at high latitudes, but for extreme storms particularly
observed by GRACE stronger orbital drag effects occur during early main phase at low/equatorial
latitudes, probably due to heating propagation from high latitudes. We find that storm-time orbital
decay along the satellites' path generally increases with storm intensity, being stronger and
faster for the most extreme events. For these events, orbital drag effects decrease faster probably
due to elevated cooling effects caused by nitric oxide, which introduce modeled density uncertainties
during storm recovery phase. Errors associated with total orbit decay introduced by JB2008 are
generally the largest for the strongest storms, and increase during storm times, particular during
recovery phases. We discuss the implication of these uncertainties for the prediction of collision
between space objects at LEO during magnetic storms.
