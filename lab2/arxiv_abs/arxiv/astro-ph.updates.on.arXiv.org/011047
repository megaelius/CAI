Persistent tension between low-redshift and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements,
in terms of the sound horizon and the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant, suggests new physics beyond the
Standard Model, departures from concordance cosmology, or residual systematics. Assessing the
likelihood of new physics devised to resolve the tension requires thorough consistency tests of
several independent and high-precision distance calibrations. We examine recent updated distance
calibrations from Cepheids, gravitational lensing time-delay observations, and the Tip of the
Red Giant Branch. Through selected cosmographic methods for combining observations of the Baryon
Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Type Ia supernovae and local distance calibrators, we obtain robust
measurements of the sound horizon, independent of cosmological models and the CMB. For our different
models and probes, the sound horizon scale varies between $r_{\rm s}=(135\pm3)$ and $r_{\rm s}=(140\pm3)$~Mpc.
The combined tension in the sound horizon and the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant ranges between $3\sigma$
and $5\sigma$, depending on whether distance ladder calibrations are used, and is independent
of possible changes to the late-Universe expansion history. Early-Universe extensions with $\textrm{N}_{\textrm{eff}}=3.27\pm0.15$
are allowed by the data, unless a Cepheid distance calibration is included. Some late-dark-energy
models, as constrained by the relative supernova distance moduli, do not resolve the current tension.
Results from time-delay lenses are consistent with those from distance-ladder calibrations.
With upcoming lens samples, the tension in the inferred sound horizon will be completely independent
from local calibrations. New proposals to resolve the tension should examine CMB and late-Universe
constraints separately, and the inference on both $H_0$ and $r_s.$
