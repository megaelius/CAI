Very long baseline interferometry at millimetre/submillimetre wavelengths (mmVLBI) offers
the highest achievable spatial resolution at any wavelength in astronomy. The anticipated inclusion
of ALMA as a phased array into a global VLBI network will bring unprecedented sensitivity and a transformational
leap in capabilities for mmVLBI. Building on years of pioneering efforts in the US and Europe the
ongoing ALMA Phasing Project (APP), a US-led international collaboration with MPIfR-led European
contributions, is expected to deliver a beamformer and VLBI capability to ALMA by the end of 2014
(APP: Fish et al. 2013, arXiv:1309.3519 ). This report focuses on the future use of mmVLBI by the international
users community from a European viewpoint. Firstly, it highlights the intense science interest
in Europe in future mmVLBI observations as compiled from the responses to a general call to the European
community for future research projects. A wide range of research is presented that includes, amongst
others: - Imaging the event horizon of the black hole at the centre of the Galaxy - Testing the theory
of General Relativity an/or searching for alternative theories - Studying the origin of AGN jets
and jet formation - Cosmological evolution of galaxies and BHs, AGN feedback - Masers in the Milky
Way (in stars and star-forming regions) - Extragalactic emission lines and astro-chemistry - Redshifted
absorption lines in distant galaxies and study of the ISM and circumnuclear gas - Pulsars, neutron
stars, X-ray binaries - Testing cosmology - Testing fundamental physical constants
