There are many stars that are rotating spheroids in the Universe, and studying them is of very important
significance. Since the times of Newton, many astronomers and physicists have researched gravitational
properties of stars by considering the moment equations derived from Eulerian hydrodynamic equations.
In this paper we study the scattering of spinors of the Dirac equation, and in particular investigate
the scattering issue in the limit case of rotating Maclaurin spheroids. Firstly we give the metric
of a rotating ellipsoid star, then write the Dirac equation under this metric, and finally derive
the scattering solution to the Dirac equation and establish a relation between differential scattering
cross-section, $\sigma$, and stellar matter density, $\mu$. It is found that the sensitivity of
$\sigma$ to the change in $\mu$ is proportional to the density $\mu$. Because of weak gravitational
field and constant mass density, our results are reasonable. The results can be applied to white
dwarfs, main sequence stars, red giants, supergiant stars and so on, as long as their gravitational
fields are so weak that they can be treated in the Newtonan approximations, and the fluid is assumed
to be incompressible. Notice that we take the star's matter density to be its average density and
the star is not taken to be compact. Obviously our results cannot be used to study neutron stars and
black holes. In particular, our results are suitable for white dwarfs, which have average densities
of about $10^{5}-10^{6}$\,g~cm$^{-3}$, corresponding to a range of mass of about $0.21-0.61 M_{\bigodot}$
and a range of radius of about $6000-10000$\,km.
