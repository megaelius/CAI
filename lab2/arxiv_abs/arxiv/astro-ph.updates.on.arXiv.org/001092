We present 3D kinematic observations of stars within the central 0.5 pc of the Milky Way nuclear star
cluster using adaptive optics imaging and spectroscopy from the Keck telescopes. Recent observations
have shown that the cluster has a shallower surface density profile than expected for a dynamically
relaxed cusp, leading to important implications for its formation and evolution. However, the
true three dimensional profile of the cluster is unknown due to the difficulty in de-projecting
the stellar number counts. Here, we use spherical Jeans modeling of individual proper motions and
radial velocities to constrain for the first time, the de-projected spatial density profile, cluster
velocity anisotropy, black hole mass ($M_\mathrm{BH}$), and distance to the Galactic center ($R_0$)
simultaneously. We find that the inner stellar density profile of the late-type stars, $\rho(r)\propto
r^{-\gamma}$ to have a power law slope $\gamma=0.05_{-0.60}^{+0.29}$, much more shallow than
the frequently assumed Bahcall $\&$ Wolf slope of $\gamma=7/4$. The measured slope will significantly
affect dynamical predictions involving the cluster, such as the dynamical friction time scale.
The cluster core must be larger than 0.5 pc, which disfavors some scenarios for its origin. Our measurement
of $M_\mathrm{BH}=5.76_{-1.26}^{+1.76}\times10^6$ $M_\odot$ and $R_0=8.92_{-0.55}^{+0.58}$
kpc is consistent with that derived from stellar orbits within 1$^{\prime\prime}$ of Sgr A*. When
combined with the orbit of S0-2, the uncertainty on $R_0$ is reduced by 30% ($8.46_{-0.38}^{+0.42}$
kpc). We suggest that the MW NSC can be used in the future in combination with stellar orbits to significantly
improve constraints on $R_0$.
