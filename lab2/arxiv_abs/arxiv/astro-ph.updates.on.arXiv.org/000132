Massive spectroscopic surveys will measure the redshift space distortion (RSD) induced by galaxy
peculiar velocity to unprecedented accuracy. We develop a new method to improve the RSD modeling
and to carry out robust reconstruction of the 3D large scale peculiar velocity through galaxy redshift
surveys, in light of RSD. (1) We propose a mathematically unique and physically motivated decomposition
of peculiar velocity into three eigen-components of different origins, different scale dependences
and different impacts on RSD. (2) This decomposition has the potential to simplify and improve the
RSD modeling. We derive a new formula for the redshift space power spectrum. Under the velocity decomposition
scheme, all high order Gaussian corrections and non-Gaussian correction of order $\delta^3$ can
be taken into account without introducing extra model uncertainties. We find that the leading order
contribution $\propto (1+f\tilde{W}(k)u^2)^2$ differs from the Kaiser formula by a function
$\tilde{W}(k)\leq 1$. We hence identify a significant systematic error causing underestimation
of the structure growth parameter $f$ by as much as $O(10%)$ even at relatively large scale $k=0.1h/$Mpc.
The velocity decomposition also reveals the three origins of the finger of God (FOG) effect. (3)
The velocity decomposition clarifies issues in peculiar velocity reconstruction through 3D galaxy
distribution. We discuss two possible ways to carry out the velocity reconstruction. Both use the
otherwise troublesome RSD in velocity reconstruction as a valuable source of information. Both
have the advantage to render the reconstruction of a stochastic 3D field into the reconstruction
of a deterministic window function $W^s(k,u)$ of limited degrees of freedom...[abridged]
