Observations show that the global deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio (D/H) in the local interstellar
medium (ISM) is about 90% of the primordial ratio predicted by big bang nucleosynthesis. The high
(D/H)$_{ISM}$ implies that only a small fraction of interstellar gas has been processed through
stars, which destroy any deuterium they are born with. Using analytic arguments for one-zone chemical
evolution models that include accretion and outflow, I show that the deuterium abundance is tightly
coupled to the abundance of core collapse supernova (CCSN) elements such as oxygen. These models
predict that the ratio of (D/H)$_{ISM}$ to the primordial abundance is $\approx 1/(1+r Z_O/m_O)$,
where r is the recycling fraction, $Z_O$ is the ISM oxygen mass fraction, and $m_O$ is the population
averaged CCSN yield of oxygen. Using values $r=0.4$ and $m_O=0.015$ appropriate to a Kroupa (2001)
initial mass function and recent CCSN yield calculations, solar oxygen abundance corresponds
to an ISM (D/H) that is 87\% of the primordial value, consistent with observations. This approximation
is accurate for a wide range of parameter values, and physical arguments suggest that it should remain
accurate for more complex chemical evolution models, making the deuterium abundance a robust prediction
of almost any model that reproduces the observed ISM metallicity. The good agreement with the upper
range of observed (D/H)$_{ISM}$ values supports the long-standing suggestion that sightline-to-sightline
variations of deuterium are a consequence of dust depletion, rather than a low global (D/H)$_{ISM}$
enhanced by localized accretion of primordial composition gas. This agreement limits deviations
from conventional yield and recycling values, and it implies that Galactic outflows eject ISM hydrogen
as efficiently as they eject CCSN metals.
