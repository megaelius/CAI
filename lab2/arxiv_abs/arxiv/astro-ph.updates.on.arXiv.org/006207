Understanding the evolution of carbon and iron in the Milky Way's halo is of importance because these
two elements play crucial roles constraining star formation, Galactic assembly, and chemical
evolution in the early Universe. Here, we explore the spatial distributions of carbonicity, [C/Fe],
and metallicity, [Fe/H], of the halo system based on medium-resolution ($R \sim$ 1,300) spectroscopy
of $\sim$58,000 stars in the Southern Hemisphere from the AAOmega Evolution of Galactic Structure
(AEGIS) survey. The AEGIS carbonicity map exhibits a positive gradient with distance, as similarly
found for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) carbonicity map of Lee et al. The metallicity map confirms
that [Fe/H] decreases with distance, from the inner halo to the outer halo. We also explore the formation
and chemical-evolution history of the halo by considering the populations of carbon-enhanced
metal-poor (CEMP) stars present in the AEGIS sample. The cumulative and differential frequencies
of CEMP-no stars (as classified by their characteristically lower levels of absolute carbon abundance,
$A$(C) $\leq$ 7.1 for sub-giants and giants) increases with decreasing metallicity, and is \textit{substantially
higher than previous determinations} for CEMP stars as a whole. In contrast, that of CEMP-$s$ stars
(with higher $A$(C)), remains almost flat, at a value $\sim$10\%, in the range $-\,4.0 \lesssim$
[Fe/H] $\lesssim-$2.0. The distinctly different behaviors of the CEMP-no and CEMP-$s$ stars relieve
the tension with population-synthesis models assuming a binary mass-transfer origin, which previously
struggled to account for the higher reported frequencies of CEMP stars, taken as a whole, at low metallicity.
