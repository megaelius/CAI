The ongoing searches for exoplanetary systems have revealed a wealth of planets with diverse physical
properties. Planets even smaller than the Earth have already been detected, and the efforts of future
missions are placed on the discovery, and perhaps characterization, of small rocky exoplanets
within the habitable zone of their stars. Clearly what we know about our planet will be our guideline
for the characterization of such planets. But the Earth has been inhabited for at least 3.8 Ga, and
its appearance has changed with time. Here, we have studied the Earth during the Archean eon, 3.0
Ga ago. At that time one of the more widespread life forms on the planet were purple bacteria. These
bacteria are photosynthetic microorganisms and can inhabit both aquatic and terrestrial environments.
Here, we used a radiative transfer model to simulate the visible and near-IR radiation reflected
by our planet, taking into account several scenarios regarding the possible distribution of purple
bacteria over continents and oceans. We find that purple bacteria have a reflectance spectrum which
has a strong reflectivity increase, similar to the red edge of leafy plants, although shifted redwards.
This feature produces a detectable signal in the disk-averaged spectra of our planet, depending
on cloud amount and on purple bacteria concentration/distribution. We conclude that by using multi-color
photometric observations, it is possible to distinguish between an Archean Earth in which purple
bacteria inhabit vast extensions of the planet, and a present-day Earth with continents covered
by deserts, vegetation or microbial mats.
