We present the results of the wide-field $^{12}$CO (1--0) observations of the nearby barred galaxy
M83 carried out with the Nobeyama Millimeter Array (NMA). The interferometric data are combined
with the data obtained with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope to recover the total-flux. The target fields
of the observations cover the molecular bar and part of the spiral arms, with a spatial resolution
of ~110 pc x 260 pc. By exploiting the resolution and sensitivity to extended CO emission, the impact
of the galactic structures on the molecular gas content is investigated in terms of the gas kinematics
and the star formation. By inspecting the gas kinematics, the pattern speed of the bar is estimated
to be 57.4 $\pm$ 2.8 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, which places the corotation radius to be about 1.7 times
the semi-major radius of the bar. Within the observed field, HII regions brighter than 10$^{37.6}$
erg s$^{-1}$ in H{\alpha} luminosity are found to be preferentially located downstream of the CO
emitting regions. Azimuthal angular offsets between molecular gas and star forming (SF) calculated
with the angular cross-correlation method confirm the trend. By comparing with a cloud orbit model
based on the derived pattern speed, the angular offsets are found to be in accordance with a time delay
of about 10 Myr. Finally, to test whether the arm/bar promote star formation efficiency (SFE $\equiv$
Star Formation Rate (SFR)/H$_2$ mass), SFR is derived with the diffuse-background-subtracted
H{alpha} and 24{\mu}m images. The arm-to-interarm ratio of the SFE is found to lie in the range of
2 to 5, while it is ~1 if no background-removal is performed. The CO-SF offsets and the enhancement
of the SFE in the arm/bar found in the inner region of M83 are in agreement with the predictions of the
classical galactic shock model.
