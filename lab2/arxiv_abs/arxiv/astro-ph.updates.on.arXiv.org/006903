We present the results of a study of the AGN density in a homogeneous and well-studied sample of 167
bona fide X-ray galaxy clusters ($0.1<z<0.5$) from the XXL Survey. The results can provide evidence
of the physical mechanisms that drive AGN and galaxy evolution within clusters. The XXL cluster
sample mostly comprises poor and moderately rich structures ($M=10^{13} - 4\times10^{14} M_{\rm
o}$). Our aim is to statistically study the demographics of cluster AGNs as a function of cluster
mass and host galaxy position. To investigate the effect of the environment on AGN activity, we computed
the fraction of spectroscopically confirmed X-ray AGNs ($L_{\rm X [0.5-10\,keV]}>10^{42}$ erg
cm$^{-1}$) in bright cluster galaxies, up to $6r_{500}$ radius. To study the mass dependence and
the evolution of the AGN population, we further divided the sample into low- and high-mass clusters
and two redshift bins (0.1-0.28 and 0.28-0.5). We detect a significant excess of X-ray AGNs, at the
95% confidence level, in low-mass clusters between $0.5r_{500}$ and 2$r_{500}$, which drops to
the field value within the cluster cores ($r<0.5r_{500}$). In contrast, high-mass clusters present
a decreasing AGN fraction towards the cluster centres. The high AGN fraction in the outskirts is
caused by low-luminosity AGNs. It can be explained by a higher galaxy merging rate in low-mass clusters,
where velocity dispersions are not high enough to prevent galaxy interactions and merging. Ram
pressure stripping is possible in the cores of all our clusters, but probably stronger in deeper
gravitational potentials. Compared with previous studies of massive or high-redshift clusters,
we conclude that the AGN fraction in cluster galaxies anti-correlates strongly with cluster mass.
The AGN fraction also increases with redshift, but at the same rate with the respective fraction
in field galaxies.
