The low wind effect (LWE) refers to a characteristic set of quasi-static wavefront aberrations
seen consistently by the SPHERE instrument when dome-level wind speeds drop below 3 m/s. This effect
produces bright low-order speckles in the stellar PSF, which severely limit the contrast performance
of SPHERE under otherwise optimal observing conditions. In this paper we propose the Fast & Furious
(F&F) phase diversity algorithm as a viable software-only solution for real-time LWE compensation,
which would utilise image sequences from the SPHERE differential tip-tilt sensor (DTTS). We evaluated
the closed-loop performance of F&F on the MITHIC high-contrast test-bench under a variety of conditions
emulating LWE-affected DTTS images, in order to assess the expected performance of an on-sky implementation
of F&F in SPHERE. The algorithm was found to be capable of returning such LWE-affected images to Strehl
ratios of greater than 90% within five iterations, for all appropriate laboratory test cases. These
results are highly representative of predictive simulations, and demonstrate the stability of
the algorithm against a wide range of factors including low image signal-to-noise ratio (S/N),
small image field of view, and amplitude errors. It was also found in simulation that closed-loop
stability can be preserved down to image S/N as low as five while still improving overall wavefront
quality, allowing for reliable operation even on faint targets. The Fast & Furious algorithm is
an extremely promising solution for real-time compensation of the LWE, which can operate simultaneously
with science observations and may be implemented in SPHERE without requiring additional hardware.
The robustness and relatively large effective dynamic range of F&F also make it suitable for general
wavefront optimisation applications, including the co-phasing of segmented ELT-class telescopes.
