The extended Schmidt law (ESL) is a variant of the Schmidt law which relates the surface densities
of gas and star formation, with the surface density of stellar mass added as an extra parameter. We
empirically investigate for the first time whether low metallicity faint dwarf irregular galaxies
(dIrrs) follow the ESL. Here we consider the `global' law where surface densities are averaged over
the galactic discs. dIrrs are unique not only because they are at the lowest end of mass and star formation
scales for galaxies, but also because they are metal-poor compared to the general population of
galaxies. Our sample is drawn from the Faint Irregular Galaxy GMRT Survey (FIGGS) which is the largest
survey of atomic hydrogen in such galaxies. The gas surface densities are determined using their
atomic hydrogen content. The star formation rates are calculated using GALEX far ultraviolet fluxes
after correcting for dust extinction, whereas the stellar surface densities are calculated using
Spitzer 3.6 $\mu$m fluxes. All surface densities are calculated over stellar discs defined by the
3.6 $\mu$m images. We find dIrrs indeed follow the extended Schmidt law. The mean deviation of the
FIGGS galaxies from the relation is 0.01 dex, with a scatter around the relation of less than half
that seen in the original relation. In comparison, we also show that the FIGGS galaxies are much more
deviant when compared to the `canonical' Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. Our results help strengthen
the universality of the extended Schmidt law, especially for galaxies with low metallicities.
We suggest that models of star formation in which feedback from previous generations of stars set
the pressure in the ISM, are promising candidates for explaining the ESL. We also confirm that ESL
is an independent relation and not a form of a relation between star formation efficiency and metallicity.
