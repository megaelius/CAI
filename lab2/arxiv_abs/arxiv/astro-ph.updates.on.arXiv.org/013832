We present the detection and characterization of the full-orbit phase curve and secondary eclipse
of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-33b at optical wavelengths, along with the pulsation spectrum of
the host star. We analyzed data collected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) in
sector 18. WASP-33b belongs to a very short list of highly irradiated exoplanets that were discovered
from the ground and were later visited by TESS. The host star of WASP-33b is of delta Scuti-type and
shows nonradial pulsations in the millimagnitude regime, with periods comparable to the period
of the primary transit. These completely deform the photometric light curve, which hinders our
interpretations. By carrying out a detailed determination of the pulsation spectrum of the host
star, we find 29 pulsation frequencies with a signal-to-noise ratio higher than 4. After cleaning
the light curve from the stellar pulsations, we confidently report a secondary eclipse depth of
305.8 +/- 35.5 parts-per-million (ppm), along with an amplitude of the phase curve of 100.4 +/- 13.1
ppm and a corresponding westward offset between the region of maximum brightness and the substellar
point of 28.7 +/- 7.1 degrees, making WASP-33b one of the few planets with such an offset found so far.
Our derived Bond albedo, A_B = 0.369 +/- 0.050, and heat recirculation efficiency, epsilon = 0.189
+/- 0.014, confirm again that he behavior of WASP-33b is similar to that of other hot Jupiters, despite
the high irradiation received from its host star. By connecting the amplitude of the phase curve
to the primary transit and depths of the secondary eclipse, we determine that the day- and nightside
brightness temperatures of WASP-33b are 3014 +/- 60 K and 1605 +/- 45 K, respectively. From the detection
of photometric variations due to gravitational interactions, we estimate a planet mass of M_P =
2.81 +/- 0.53 M$_J.
