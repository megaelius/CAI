We present a survey of optical [OI] emission at 6300 \AA\ toward 65 TTauri stars at the spectral resolution
of $\sim7$ km/s. Past work identified a highly blueshifted velocity component (HVC) tracing microjets,
and a less blueshifted low-velocity-component (LVC) attributed to winds. We focus here on the LVC
kinematics to investigate links between winds, jets, accretion, and disk dispersal. We track the
behavior of four types of LVC components: a broad and narrow component ("BC" and "NC") in LVCs that
are decomposed into two Gaussians, which typically have an HVC, and the single-Gaussian LVC profiles
separated into those that have an HVC ("SCJ") and those that do not ("SC"). LVC centroid velocities
and line widths correlate with HVC equivalent width and accretion luminosity, suggesting that
LVC/winds and HVC/jets are kinematically linked and connected to accretion. The deprojected HVC
velocity correlates with accretion luminosity, showing that faster jets come with higher accretion.
BC and NC kinematics correlate and their blueshifts are maximum at $\sim 35^{\circ}$, suggesting
a conical wind geometry with this semi-opening angle. Only SCs include $n_{13-31}$ up to $\sim3$
and their properties correlate with this infrared index, showing that [OI] emission recedes to
larger radii as the inner dust is depleted, tracing less dense/hot gas and a decrease in wind velocity.
All together, these findings support a scenario where optically thick, accreting inner disks launch
radially-extended MHD disk winds that feed jets, and where inner disk winds recede to larger radii
and jets disappear in concert with dust depletion.
