The understanding of the accelerated expansion of the Universe poses one of the most fundamental
questions in physics and cosmology today. Whether or not the acceleration is driven by some form
of dark energy, and in the absence of a well-based theory to interpret the observations, many models
have been proposed to solve this problem, both in the context of General Relativity and alternative
theories of gravity. Actually, a further possibility to investigate the nature of dark energy lies
in measuring the dark energy equation of state (EOS), w, and its time (or redshift) dependence at
high accuracy. However, since w(z) is not directly accessible to measurement, reconstruction
methods are needed to extract it reliably from observations. Here we investigate different models
of dark energy, described through several parametrizations of the EOS. Our high-redshift analysis
is based on the Union2 Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) data set, the Hubble diagram constructed from some
Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) luminosity distance indicators, and Gaussian priors on the distance from
the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and the Hubble constant h (these priors have been included
in order to help break the degeneracies among model parameters). To perform our statistical analysis
and to explore the probability distributions of the EOS parameters we use the Markov Chain Monte
Carlo Method (MCMC). It turns out that the dark energy equation of state is evolving for all the parametrizations
that we considered. We finally compare our results with the ones obtained by previous cosmographic
analysis performed on the same astronomical datasets, showing that the latter ones are sufficient
to test and compare the new parametrizations.
