We present profiles of temperature, gas mass, and hydrostatic mass estimated from X-ray observations
of CLASH clusters. We compare measurements from XMM and Chandra and compare both sets to CLASH gravitational
lensing mass profiles. We find that Chandra and XMM measurements of electron density and enclosed
gas mass as functions of radius are nearly identical, indicating that any differences in hydrostatic
masses inferred from X-ray observations arise from differences in gas-temperature estimates.
Encouragingly, gas temperatures measured in clusters by XMM and Chandra are consistent with one
another at ~100 kpc radii but XMM temperatures systematically decline relative to Chandra temperatures
as the radius of the temperature measurement increases. One plausible reason for this trend is large-angle
scattering of soft X-ray photons in excess of that amount expected from the standard XMM PSF correction.
We present the CLASH-X mass-profile comparisons in the form of cosmology-independent and redshift-independent
circular-velocity profiles, which are the most robust way to assess mass bias. Chandra HSE mass
to CLASH lensing mass ratio profiles show no obvious radial dependence in the 0.3-0.8 Mpc range.
However, the mean mass biases inferred from the WL and SaWLens data are different, with a weighted-mean
value at 0.5 Mpc of <b>=0.12 for the WL comparison and <b>= -0.11 for the SaWLens comparison.
XMM HSE mass to CLASH lensing mass ratio profiles show a pronounced radial dependence in the 0.3-1.0
Mpc range, with a weighted-mean mass bias of value rising to b>0.3 at ~1 Mpc for the WL comparison
and b~0.25 for the SaWLens comparison. The enclosed gas mass profiles from both Chandra and XMM rise
to a value ~1/8 times the total-mass profiles inferred from lensing at ~0.5 Mpc, suggesting that
8 M_gas profiles may be an excellent proxy for total-mass profiles at >~0.5 Mpc in massive galaxy
clusters.
