Interstellar dust absorbs stellar light very efficiently and thus shapes the energetic output
of galaxies. Studying the impact of different stellar populations on the dust heating remains hard
because it requires decoupling the relative geometry of stars and dust, and involves complex processes
as scattering and non-local dust heating. We aim to constrain the relative distribution of dust
and stellar populations in the spiral galaxy M81 and create a realistic model of the radiation field
that describes the observations. Investigating the dust-starlight interaction on local scales,
we want to quantify the contribution of young and old stellar populations to the dust heating. We
aim to standardise the setup and model selection of such inverse radiative transfer simulations
so this can be used for comparable modelling of other nearby galaxies. We present a semi-automated
radiative transfer modelling pipeline that implements the necessary steps such as the geometric
model construction and the normalisation of the components through an optimisation routine. We
use the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code SKIRT to calculate a self-consistent, panchromatic
model of the interstellar radiation field. By looking at different stellar populations independently,
we can quantify to what extent different stellar age populations contribute to the dust heating.
Our method takes into account the effects of non-local heating. We obtain a realistic 3D radiative
transfer model of the face-on galaxy M81. We find that only 50.2\% of the dust heating can be attributed
to young stellar populations. We confirm a tight correlation between the specific star formation
rate and the heating fraction by young stellar populations, both in sky projection and in 3D, also
found for radiative transfer models of M31 and M51. We conclude that... (abridged)
