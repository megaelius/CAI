Radiative feedback (RFB) from stars plays a key role in galaxies, but remains poorly-understood.
We explore this using high-resolution, multi-frequency radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations
from the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. We study dwarf through Milky Way masses,
and explore RHD effects including H/He photoionization; photoelectric, Lyman Werner, Compton,
thermal dust heating; single and multiple-scattering radiation pressure (RP). We also compare
fundamentally distinct RHD algorithms: the ray-based LEBRON (exact when optically-thin) and
moments-based M1 (exact when optically-thick). In all cases, the dominant RFB channels on galaxy
scales are photoionization heating and single-scattering RP. At all masses, most of the ionizing/FUV
luminosity from young stars (~half bolometric) is absorbed. In dwarfs, the strongest effect is
photoionization heating from the meta-galactic background, suppressing accretion onto galaxies.
At MW-mass the meta-galactic background has negligible effects; but local photoionization and
single-scattering RP both contribute significantly to regulating the galactic star formation
efficiency and lowering central densities. Without some RFB (or other 'rapid' FB), resolved GMCs
turn most of their mass into stars, making galaxies dominated by hyper-dense, bound clusters. This
makes star formation more violent and 'bursty' when SNe explode in hyper-clustered objects: thus,
including RFB tends to 'smooth out' star formation. IR multiple-scattering is rare: the majority
of photon absorption occurs in 'normal' GMCs with $A_{V}\sim1$. These conclusions are robust to
the RHD method, but M1 produces somewhat stronger RFB effects.
