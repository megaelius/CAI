The epoch of reionization (6 < z < 10) marks the period in our universe when the first large galaxies
grew to fruition, and began to affect the universe around them. Massive stars, and potentially accreting
supermassive black holes, filled the universe with ionizing radiation, burning off the haze of
neutral gas that had filled the intergalactic medium (IGM) since recombination (z~1000). The evolution
of this process constrains key properties of these earliest luminous sources, thus observationally
constraining reionization is a key science goal for the next decade. The measurement of Lyman-alpha
emission from photometrically-identified galaxies is a highly constraining probe of reionization,
as a neutral IGM will resonantly scatter these photons, reducing detectability. While significant
work has been done with 8-10m telescopes, these observations require extremely large telescopes
(ELTs); the flux limits available from today's 10m class telescopes are sufficient for only the
brightest known galaxies (m < 26). Ultra-deep surveys with the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) and
Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) will be capable of detecting Lyman-alpha emission from galaxies 2-3
magnitudes fainter than today's deepest surveys. Wide-field fiber spectroscopy on the GMT combined
with narrow-field AO-assisted slit spectroscopy on the TMT will be able to probe the expected size
of ionized bubbles throughout the epoch of reionization, following up degree scale deep imaging
surveys with the Wide Field Infrared Space Telescope. These data will provide the first resolved
Lyman-alpha-based maps of the ionized intergalactic medium throughout the epoch of reionization,
constraining models of both the temporal and spatial evolution of this phase change.
