We study black hole - host galaxy correlations, and the relation between the over-massiveness (the
distance from the average $M_{BH}-\sigma$ relation) of super-massive black holes (SMBHs) and
star formation histories of their host galaxies in the Illustris and TNG100 simulations. We find
that both simulations are able to produce black hole scaling relations in general agreement with
observations at $z=0$, but with noticeable discrepancies. Both simulations show an offset from
the observations for the $M_{BH}-\sigma$ relation, and the relation between $M_{BH}$ and the Sersic
index. The relation between $M_{BH}$ and stellar mass $M_*$ is tighter than the observations, especially
for TNG100. For massive galaxies in both simulations, the hosts of over-massive SMBHs (those above
the mean $M_{BH}-\sigma$ relation) tend to have larger Sersic indices and lower baryon conversion
efficiency, suggesting a multidimensional link between SMBHs and properties of their hosts. In
Illustris, the hosts of over-massive SMBHs have formed earlier and have lower present-day star
formation rates, in qualitative agreement with the observations for massive galaxies with $\sigma>100
\rm km/s$. For low-mass galaxies, such a correlation still holds in Illustris but does not exist
in the observed data. For TNG100, the correlation between SMBH over-massiveness and star formation
history is much weaker. The hosts of over-massive SMBHs generally have consistently larger star
formation rates throughout history. These galaxies have higher stellar mass as well, due to the
strong $M_{BH}-M_*$ correlation. Our findings show that simulated SMBH scaling relations and
correlations are sensitive to features in the modeling of SMBHs.
