Since the very beginning of astronomy the location of objects on the sky has been a fundamental observational
quantity that has been taken for granted. While precise two dimensional positional information
is easy to obtain for observations in the electromagnetic spectrum, the positional accuracy of
current and near future gravitational wave detectors is limited to between tens and hundreds of
square degrees, which makes it extremely challenging to identify the host galaxies of gravitational
wave events or to confidently detect any electromagnetic counterparts. Gravitational wave observations
provide information on source properties and distances that is complementary to the information
in any associated electromagnetic emission and that is very hard to obtain in any other way. Observing
systems with multiple messengers thus has scientific potential much greater than the sum of its
parts. A gravitational wave detector with higher angular resolution would significantly increase
the prospects for finding the hosts of gravitational wave sources and triggering a multi-messenger
follow-up campaign. An observatory with arcminute precision or better could be realised within
the Voyage 2050 programme by creating a large baseline interferometer array in space and would have
transformative scientific potential. Precise positional information of standard sirens would
enable precision measurements of cosmological parameters and offer new insights on structure
formation; a high angular resolution gravitational wave observatory would allow the detection
of a stochastic background and resolution of the anisotropies within it; it would also allow the
study of accretion processes around black holes; and it would have tremendous potential for tests
of modified gravity and the discovery of physics beyond the Standard Model.
