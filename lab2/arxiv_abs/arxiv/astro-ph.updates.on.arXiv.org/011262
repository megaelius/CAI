Spitzer Space Telescope observations of 15 spiral galaxies show numerous dense cores at 8 microns
that are revealed primarily in unsharp mask images. The cores are generally invisible in optical
bands because of extinction, and they are also indistinct at 8 microns alone because of contamination
by more widespread diffuse emission. Several hundred core positions, magnitudes, and colors from
the four IRAC bands are measured and tabulated for each galaxy. The larger galaxies, which tend to
have longer and more regular spiral arms, often have their infrared cores aligned along these arms,
with additional cores in spiral arm spurs. Galaxies without regular spirals have their cores in
more irregular spiral-like filaments, with typically only one or two cores per filament. Nearly
every elongated emission feature has 8 micron cores strung out along its length. The occurrence
of dense cores in long and thin filaments is reminiscent of filamentary star formation in the solar
neighborhood, although on a scale 100 times larger in galaxies. The cores most likely form by gravitational
instabilities and cloud agglomeration in the filaments. The simultaneous occurrence of several
cores with regular spacings in some spiral arms suggests that in these cases, all of the cores formed
at about the same time and the corresponding filaments are young. Total star formation rates for
the galaxies correlate with the total embedded stellar masses in the cores with an average ratio
corresponding to a possible age between 0.2 Myr and 2 Myr. This suggests that the identified cores
are the earliest phase for most star formation.
