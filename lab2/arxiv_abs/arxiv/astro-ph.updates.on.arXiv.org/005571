We investigate the influence of collective self-gravity forces on the nonlinear, large-scale
evolution of the viscous overstability in Saturn's rings. We numerically solve the axisymmetric
hydrodynamic equations in the isothermal and non-isothermal approximation, including radial
self-gravity and employing transport coefficients derived by Salo et al. We assume optical depths
of 1.5-2 to model Saturn's dense rings. Furthermore, local N-body simulations, incorporating
vertical and radial collective self-gravity are performed. Vertical self-gravity is mimicked
through an increased frequency of vertical oscillations, while radial self-gravity is approximated
by solving the Poisson equation for an axisymmetric thin disk with a Fourier method. Direct particle-particle
forces are omitted, which prevents small-scale gravitational instabilities (self-gravity wakes)
from forming, an approximation that allows us to study long radial scales and to compare directly
the hydrodynamic model and the N-body simulations. Our isothermal and non-isothermal hydrodynamic
model results with vanishing self-gravity compare very well with results of Latter & Ogilvie and
Rein & Latter, respectively. In contrast, for rings with radial self-gravity we find that the wavelengths
of saturated overstable waves settle close to the frequency minimum of the nonlinear dispersion
relation, i.e. close to a state of vanishing group velocities of the waves. Good agreement is found
between non-isothermal hydrodynamics and N-body simulations for moderate and strong radial self-gravity,
while the largest deviations occur for weak self-gravity. The resulting saturation wavelengths
of viscous overstability for moderate and strong self-gravity (100-300m) agree reasonably well
with the length scales of axisymmetric periodic micro-structure in Saturn's inner A-ring and the
B-ring, as found by Cassini.
