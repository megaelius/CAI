Giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn feature strong zonal wind patterns on their surfaces. Although
several different mechanisms that may drive these jets have been proposed over the last decades,
the origin of the zonal winds is still unclear. Here, we explore the possibility that the interplay
of planetary rotation with the compression and expansion of the convecting fluid can drive multiple
deep zonal jets by a compressional Rhines-type mechanism, as originally proposed by Ingersoll
and Pollard (1982). In a certain limit, this deep mechanism is shown to be mathematically analogous
to the classical Rhines mechanism possibly operating at cloud level. Jets are predicted to occur
on a compressional Rhines length $l_R = (2 \Omega \langle H_\rho^{-1} \rangle v_{jet}^{-1} )^{-1/2}$,
where $\Omega$ is the angular velocity, $\langle H_\rho^{-1} \rangle$ is the mean inverse density
scale height and $v_{jet}$ is the typical jet velocity. Two-dimensional numerical simulations
using the anelastic approximation reveal that this mechanism robustly generates jets of the predicted
width, and that it typically dominates the dynamics in systems deeper than $O(l_R)$. Potential
vorticity staircases are observed to form spontaneously and are typically accompanied by unstably
stratified buoyancy staircases. The mechanism only operates at large rotation rates, exceeding
those typically reached in three-dimensional simulations of deep convection in spherical shells.
Applied to Jupiter and Saturn, the compressional Rhines scaling reasonably fits the available
observations. Interestingly, even weak vertical density variations such as those in the Earth
core can give rise to a large number of jets, leading to fundamentally different flow structures
than predicted by the Boussinesq models typically used in this context.
