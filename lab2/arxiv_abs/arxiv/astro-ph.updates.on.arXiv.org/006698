Vortices in protoplanetary disks have attracted attention since the discovery of lopsided structures.
One of the possible mechanisms for producing vortices is the Rossby Wave Instability (RWI). In our
previous work, we have performed detailed linear stability analyses of the RWI with various initial
conditions. In this paper, we perform numerical simulations of the vortex formation by the RWI in
2D barotropic disks using the Athena++ code. As initial conditions, we consider axisymmetric disks
with a Gaussian surface density bump of various contrasts and half-widths. Perturbations grow
as expected from the linear stability analyses in the linear and weakly non-linear regimes. After
the saturation, multiple vortices are formed in accordance with the most unstable azimuthal mode
and coalesce one after another. In the end, only one quasi-stationary vortex (the RWI vortex) remains,
which migrates inward. During the RWI evolution, the axisymmetric component approaches the stable
configuration. We find that the axisymmetric component reaches the marginally stable state for
the most unstable azimuthal mode at the saturation and the marginally stable state for the m = 1 mode
at the final vortex merger. We investigate the structure and evolution of the RWI vortices. We obtain
some empirical relations between the properties of the RWI vortices and the initial conditions.
Using tracer particle analyses, we find that the RWI vortex can be considered as a physical entity
like a large fluid particle. Our results provide a solid theoretical ground for quantitative interpretation
of the observed lopsided structures in protoplanetary disks.
