We present results of a global survey of single-pixel intensity power spectra from a 12-hour time
period on June 26, 2013 in a 1600x1600 pixel region from five channels of the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument. We extract single-pixel time series from
a derotated image sequence, fit models to the power spectra of these time series, and study the spatial
dependence of the model parameters. Two power spectra models are considered: (1) a 3-parameter
power-law + tail model and (2) a power-law + tail model + 3-parameter localized Gaussian, which models
a periodicity. In general, spectra are well-described by at least one of these two models for all
pixel locations, with an average data/model correlation of 0.93 and a standard deviation of 0.1.
The spatial distribution of best-fit parameter values for the models are shown to provide new and
unique insights into turbulent, quiescent and periodic features in the EUV solar corona and upper
photosphere. Locations where the second model is significantly better than the first model correspond
clearly and directly to different visible features in the AIA observations and reveal quasi-periodic
3- and 5-minute oscillations. Other findings include: a method for parameterizing solar EUV observations
at pixel-level resolution based on their power spectra; observational identification of concentrated
magnetic flux as regions of largest power-law indices; identification of unique spectral features
of coronal holes and filaments; identification of sporadic and pervasive 5-minute oscillations
throughout the EUV solar corona; a global ~4.0-minute oscillation in 1600A; "Coronal Bullseyes"
appearing as radially decaying periodicities over sunspot and sporadic foot-point regions; and
"Penumbral Periodic Voids" around sunspots in 1600 and 1700A in which there is no statistically
significant Gaussian component.
