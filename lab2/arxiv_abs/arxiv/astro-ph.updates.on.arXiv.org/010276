With no analogues in the Solar System, the discovery of thousands of exoplanets with masses and radii
intermediate between Earth and Neptune was one of the big surprises of exoplanet science. These
super-Earths and sub-Neptunes likely represent the most common outcome of planet formation. Mass
and radius measurements indicate a diversity in bulk composition much wider than for gas giants;
however, direct spectroscopic detections of molecular absorption and constraints on the gas mixing
ratios have largely remained limited to planets more massive than Neptune. Here, we analyze a combined
Hubble/Spitzer Space Telescope dataset of 12 transits and 20 eclipses of the sub-Neptune GJ 3470
b, whose mass of 12.6 $M_\oplus$ places it near the half-way point between previously studied exo-Neptunes
(22-23 $M_\oplus$) and exoplanets known to have rocky densities (7 $M_\oplus$). Obtained over
many years, our data set provides a robust detection of water absorption (>5$\sigma$) and a thermal
emission detection from the lowest irradiated planet to date. We reveal a low-metallicity, hydrogen-dominated
atmosphere similar to a gas giant, but strongly depleted in methane gas. The low, near-solar metallicity
(O/H=0.2-18) sets important constraints on the potential planet formation processes at low masses
as well as the subsequent accretion of solids. The low methane abundance indicates that methane
is destroyed much more efficiently than previously predicted, suggesting that the CH$_4$/CO transition
curve has to be revisited for close-in planets. Finally, we also find a sharp drop in the cloud opacity
at 2-3 $\mu$m characteristic of Mie scattering, which enables narrow constraints on the cloud particle
size and makes GJ 3470b a keystone target for mid-IR characterization with JWST.
