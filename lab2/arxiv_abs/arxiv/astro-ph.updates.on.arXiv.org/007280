Line intensity mapping opens up a new and exciting window for probing cosmology and fundamental
physics during the Epoch of Reionisation, extending to redshifts previously untested by galaxy
surveys. The power spectra of these line fluctuations are a promising tool to test gravity over a
large range of scales and redshifts. We simulate cosmological volumes of 21cm fluctuations in general
parametrisations of modified gravity, in order to calculate the corresponding power spectra,
where additional parameters are the initial condition of matter perturbations $\alpha$ and the
scale-dependent modified gravity parameter $Y$ (also known as $G_\mathrm{eff}$) that measures
deviations from GR in the Poisson equation. We show the impact of these model-independent modifications
of gravity, to either delay or expedite reionisation. For the 21cm intensity mapping survey to be
performed by the SKA mission, we forecast the ability of line intensity mapping to constrain the
parameters $Y$ and $\alpha$ at redshifts $z=6-11$, where $Y$ is assumed constant during this epoch
(but without requiring constancy at all times). In our most conservative scenario, the $Y$ parameter
can be constrained at the tens of percent level, while for improved modelling of foregrounds as well
as of the (mildly) non-linear regime, up to sub-percent level constraints are attainable. We show
the impact of jointly estimating reionisation model parameters and corresponding parameter correlations,
as well as of foreground removal. We note, that tomography is crucial to break degeneracies and for
constraints not to degrade significantly when adding reionisation model parameters, with most
constraining power coming from the redshift bins $z=7-10$ where the shape of the 21cm power spectrum
is evolving fastest.
