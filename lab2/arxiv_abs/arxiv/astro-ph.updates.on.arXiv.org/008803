Cool main-sequence, sub-giant and red-giant stars all show solar-like oscillations, pulsations
that are excited and intrinsically damped by near-surface convection. Many overtones are typically
excited to observable amplitudes, giving a rich spectrum of detectable modes. These modes provide
a wealth of information on fundamental stellar properties. However, the radial velocity shifts
induced by these oscillations can also be problematic when searching for low-mass, long-period
planets; this is because their amplitudes are large enough to completely mask such minute planetary
signals. Here we show how fine-tuning exposure times to the stellar parameters can help efficiently
average out the solar-like-oscillation-induced shifts. To reduce the oscillation signal to the
radial velocity precision commensurate with an Earth-analogue, we find that for cool, low-mass
stars (near spectral type K) the necessary exposure times may be as short as 4 minutes, while for hotter,
higher-mass stars (near spectral type F, or slightly evolved) the required exposure times can be
longer than 100 minutes. We provide guideline exposure durations required to suppress the total
observed amplitude due to oscillations to a level of $0.1\,\rm m\,s^{-1}$, and a level corresponding
to the Earth-analogue reflex amplitude for the star. Owing to the intrinsic stochastic variability
of the oscillations, we recommend in practice choosing short exposure durations at the telescope
and then averaging over those exposures later, as guided by our predictions. To summarize, as we
enter an era of $0.1\,\rm m\,s^{-1}$ instrumental precision, it is critical to tailor our observing
strategies to the stellar properties.
