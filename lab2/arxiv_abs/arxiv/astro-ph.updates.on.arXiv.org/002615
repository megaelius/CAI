Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are generally believed to be old neutron stars (NSs) which have been
spun up to high rotation rates via accretion of matter from a companion star in a low-mass X-ray binary
(LMXB). However, many details of this recycling scenario remain to be understood. Here we investigate
binary evolution in close LMXBs to study the formation of radio MSPs with low-mass helium white dwarf
companions (He WDs) in tight binaries with orbital periods P_orb = 2-9 hr. In particular, we examine:
i) if such observed systems can be reproduced from theoretical modelling using standard prescriptions
of orbital angular momentum losses (i.e. with respect to the nature and the strength of magnetic
braking), ii) if our computations of the Roche-lobe detachments can match the observed orbital
periods, and iii) if the correlation between WD mass and orbital period (M_WD, P_orb) is valid for
systems with P_orb < 2 days. Numerical calculations with a detailed stellar evolution code were
used to trace the mass-transfer phase in ~ 400 close LMXB systems with different initial values of
donor star mass, NS mass, orbital period and the so-called gamma-index of magnetic braking. Subsequently,
we followed the orbital and the interior evolution of the detached low-mass (proto) He WDs, including
stages with residual shell hydrogen burning. We find that a severe fine-tuning is necessary to reproduce
the observed MSPs in tight binaries with He WD companions of mass < 0.20 M_sun, which suggests
that something needs to be modified or is missing in the standard input physics of LMXB modelling.
We demonstrate that the theoretically calculated (M_WD, P_orb)-relation is in general also valid
for systems with P_orb < 2 days, although with a large scatter in He WD masses between 0.15-0.20
M_sun. The results of the thermal evolution of the (proto) He WDs are reported in a follow-up paper
(Paper II).
