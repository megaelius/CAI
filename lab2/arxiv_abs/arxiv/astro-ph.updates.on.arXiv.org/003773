The HeII transverse proximity effect - enhanced HeII Ly{\alpha} transmission in a background sightline
caused by the ionizing radiation of a foreground quasar - offers a unique opportunity to probe the
emission properties of quasars, in particular the emission geometry (obscuration, beaming) and
the quasar lifetime. Building on the foreground quasar survey published in Schmidt+2017, we present
a detailed model of the HeII transverse proximity effect, specifically designed to include light
travel time effects, finite quasar ages, and quasar obscuration. We post-process outputs from
a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation with a fluctuating HeII UV background model, plus the
added effect of the radiation from a single bright foreground quasar. We vary the age $t_\mathrm{age}$
and obscured sky fractions $\Omega_\mathrm{obsc}$ of the foreground quasar, and explore the resulting
effect on the HeII transverse proximity effect signal. Fluctuations in IGM density and the UV background,
as well as the unknown orientation of the foreground quasar, result in a large variance of the HeII
Ly{\alpha} transmission along the background sightline. We develop a fully Bayesian statistical
formalism to compare far UV HeII Ly{\alpha} transmission spectra of the background quasars to our
models, and extract joint constraints on $t_\mathrm{age}$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{obsc}$ for the
six Schmidt+2017 foreground quasars with the highest implied HeII photoionization rates. Our
analysis suggests a bimodal distribution of quasar emission properties, whereby one foreground
quasar, associated with a strong HeII transmission spike, is relatively old $(22\,\mathrm{Myr})$
and unobscured $\Omega_\mathrm{obsc}<35\%$, whereas three others are either younger than $(10\,\mathrm{Myr})$
or highly obscured $(\Omega_\mathrm{obsc}>70\%)$.
