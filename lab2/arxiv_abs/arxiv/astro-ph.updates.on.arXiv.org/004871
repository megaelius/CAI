Stars stripped of their envelope through interaction in a binary are generally not considered when
accounting for ionizing radiation from stellar populations, despite the expectation that stripped
stars emit hard ionizing radiation, form frequently and live 10-100 times longer than single massive
stars. We compute the first grid of spectral models specially made for stars stripped in binaries
for a range of progenitor masses (2-20$M_{\odot}$) and metallicities covering a wide range. For
stripped stars with masses between 0.3-7$M_{\odot}$, we find high effective temperatures (20-100
kK, increasing with mass), small radii (0.2-1$R_{\odot}$) and high bolometric luminosities,
comparable to that of their progenitor before stripping. The spectra show a continuous sequence
that naturally bridges subdwarf-type stars and Wolf-Rayet like spectra. For intermediate masses
we find hybrid spectral classes showing a mixture of absorption and emission lines. These appear
for stars with mass loss rates of $10^{-8}-10^{-6}M_{\odot}$/yr, which have semi-transparent
atmospheres. At low metallicity, substantial H-rich layers are left at the surface and we predict
spectra that resemble O-type stars instead. We obtain spectra undistinguishable from subdwarfs
for stripped stars with masses up to 1.7$M_{\odot}$, which questions whether the widely adopted
canonical value of 0.47$M_{\odot}$ is uniformly valid. Increasing the observed sample of stripped
stars will provide necessary tests for the physics of interaction, internal mixing and stellar
winds. We investigate the feasibility to detect stripped stars next to an optically bright companion
and recommend searches for their UV excess and possible emission lines, most notably HeII4686 in
the optical and HeII1640 in the UV. Our models are publicly available for further investigations
or inclusion in spectral synthesis simulations.
