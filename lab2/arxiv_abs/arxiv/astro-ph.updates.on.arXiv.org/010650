Context: Distant trans-Neptunian objects are subject to planetary perturbations and galactic
tides. The former decrease with the distance, while the latter increase. In the intermediate regime
where they have the same order of magnitude (the 'inert Oort cloud'), both are weak, resulting in
very long evolution timescales. To date, three observed objects can be considered to belong to this
category. Aims: We aim to provide a clear understanding of where this transition occurs, and to characterise
the long-term dynamics of small bodies in the intermediate regime: relevant resonances, chaotic
zones (if any), and timescales at play. Results: There exists a tilted equilibrium plane (Laplace
plane) about which orbits precess. The dynamics is integrable in the low and high semi-major axis
regimes, but mostly chaotic in between. From 800 to 1100 au, the chaos covers almost all the eccentricity
range. The diffusion timescales are large, but not to the point of being indiscernible in a 4.5 Gyrs
duration: the perihelion distance can actually vary from tens to hundreds of au. Orbital variations
are favoured in specific ranges of inclination corresponding to well-defined resonances. Starting
from uniform distributions, the orbital angles cluster after 4.5 Gyrs for semi-major axes larger
than 500 au, because of a very slow differential precession. Conclusions: Even if it is characterised
by very long timescales, the inert Oort cloud is much less inert than it appears. Orbits can be considered
inert over 4.5 Gyrs only in small portions of the space of orbital elements, which include (90377)
Sedna and 2012VP113. Effects of the galactic tides are discernible down to semi-major axes of about
500 au. We advocate including the galactic tides in simulations of distant trans-Neptunian objects,
especially when studying the formation of detached bodies or the clustering of orbital elements.
