Magnetized plasmas within halos of galaxies leave their footprint on the polarized anisotropies
of the cosmic microwave background. The two dominant effects for astrophysical halos are Faraday
rotation generating rotation of the plane of linear polarization, and Faraday conversion inducing
a leakage from linear polarization to circular polarization. We revisit these sources of secondary
anisotropies by computing the angular power spectra of the Faraday rotation angle and of the Faraday
conversion rate by the large scale structures. To this end, we use the halo model and we pay special
attention to the impact of magnetic field projections. Assuming magnetic fields of halos to be uncorrelated,
we found a vanishing 2-halo term, and angular power spectra peaking at multipoles $\ell\sim10^4$.
The Faraday rotation angle is dominated by the contribution of thermal electrons. For the Faraday
conversion rate, we found that both thermal electrons and relativistic, non-thermal electrons
contribute equally in the most optimistic case for the density and Lorentz factor of relativistic
electrons, while in more pessimistic cases the thermal electrons give the dominant contribution.
Assuming the magnetic field to be independent of the halo mass, the angular power spectra for both
effects roughly scale with the amplitude of matter perturbations as $\sim\sigma_8^3$, and with
a very mild dependence with the density of cold dark matter. Introducing a dependence of the magnetic
field strength with the halo mass leads to an increase of the scaling with the amplitude of matter
fluctuations, up to $\sim\sigma_8^{9.5}$ for Faraday rotation and $\sim\sigma_8^{15}$ for Faraday
conversion for a magnetic field strength scaling linearly with the halo mass.
