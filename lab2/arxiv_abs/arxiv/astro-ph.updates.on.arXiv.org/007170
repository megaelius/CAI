The recent discovery of gravitational waves marks the culmination of a sequence of successful tests
of the general theory of relativity (GR) since its formulation in 1915. Yet these tests remain confined
to the scale of stellar systems or the strong gravity regime. A departure from GR on larger, cosmological
scales has been advocated by the proponents of modified gravity theories as an alternative to the
Cosmological Constant to account for the observed cosmic expansion history. While indistinguishable
in these terms by construction, such models on the other hand yield distinct values for the linear
growth rate of density perturbations and, as a consequence, for the associated galaxy peculiar
velocity field. Measurements of the resulting anisotropy of galaxy clustering, when spectroscopic
redshifts are used to derive distances, have thus been proposed as a powerful probe of the validity
of GR on cosmological scales. However, despite significant effort in modelling such redshift space
distortions, systematic errors remain comparable to current statistical uncertainties. Here,
we present the results of a different forward-modelling approach, which fully exploits the sensitivity
of the galaxy velocity field to modifications of GR. We use state-of-the-art, high-resolution
N-body simulations of a standard GR and a compelling f(R) model, one of GR's simplest variants, to
build simulated catalogues of stellar-mass-selected galaxies through a robust match to the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey observations. We find that, well within the uncertainty of this technique, f(R)
fails to reproduce the observed redshift-space clustering on scales 1-10 Mpc/h. Instead, the standard
LCDM GR model agrees impressively well with the data. This result provides a strong confirmation,
on cosmological scales, of the robustness of Einstein's general theory of relativity.
