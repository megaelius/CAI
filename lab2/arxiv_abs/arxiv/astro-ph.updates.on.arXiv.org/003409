The determination of chemical abundances constitutes a fundamental requirement for obtaining
a complete picture of a star. Particularly in massive stars, CNO abundances are of prime interest,
due to the nuclear CNO-cycle and various mixing processes which bring these elements to the surface.
We aim at enabling a reliable carbon spectroscopy for our unified NLTE atmosphere code FASTWIND.
We develop a new carbon model atom including CII/III/IV/V, and discuss problems related to carbon
spectroscopy in O-type stars. We describe different tests to examine the reliability of our implementation,
and investigate which mechanisms influence the carbon ionization balance. By comparing with high-resolution
spectra from six O-type stars, we check in how far observational constraints can be reproduced by
our new carbon line synthesis. Carbon lines are even more sensitive to a variation of temperature,
gravity, and mass-loss rate, than hydrogen/helium lines. We are able to reproduce most of the observed
lines from our stellar sample, and to estimate those specific carbon abundances which bring the
lines from different ions into agreement. For hot dwarfs and supergiants earlier than O7, X-rays
from wind-embedded shocks can impact the synthesized line strengths, particularly for CIV, potentially
affecting the abundance determination. We have demonstrated our capability to derive realistic
carbon abundances by means of FASTWIND, using our recently developed model atom. We found that complex
effects can have a strong influence on the carbon ionization balance in hot stars. For a further understanding,
the UV range needs to be explored as well. By means of detailed nitrogen and oxygen model atoms available
to use, we will be able to perform a complete CNO abundance analysis for larger samples of massive
stars, and to provide constraints on corresponding evolutionary models and aspects.
