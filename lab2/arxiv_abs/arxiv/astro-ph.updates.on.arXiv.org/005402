Decades ago S. Lundquist, S. Chandrasekhar, P.H. Roberts and R. J.~Tayler first posed questions
about the stability of Taylor-Couette flows of conducting material under the influence of large-scale
magnetic fields. These and many new questions can now be answered numerically where the nonlinear
simulations even provide the instability-induced values of several transport coefficients.
The cylindrical containers are axially unbounded and penetrated by magnetic background fields
with axial and/or azimuthal components. The influence of the magnetic Prandtl number $Pm$ on the
onset of the instabilities is shown to be substantial. The potential flow subject to axial fields
becomes unstable against axisymmetric perturbations for a certain supercritical value of the
averaged Reynolds number $\overline{Rm}=\sqrt{Re\cdot Rm}$ (with $Re$ the Reynolds number of
rotation, $Rm$ its magnetic Reynolds number). Rotation profiles as flat as the quasi-Keplerian
rotation law scale similarly but only for $Pm\gg 1$ while for $Pm\ll 1$ the instability instead sets
in for supercritical $Rm$ at an optimal value of the magnetic field. Among the considered instabilities
of azimuthal fields, those of the Chandrasekhar-type, where the background field and the background
flow have identical radial profiles, are particularly interesting. They are unstable against
nonaxisymmetric perturbations if at least one of the diffusivities is non-zero. For $Pm\ll 1$ the
onset of the instability scales with $Re$ while it scales with $\overline{Rm}$ for $Pm\gg 1$. - Even
superrotation can be destabilized by azimuthal and current-free magnetic fields; this recently
discovered nonaxisymmetric instability is of a double-diffusive character, thus excluding $Pm=
1$. It scales with $Re$ for $Pm\to 0$ and with $Rm$ for $Pm\to \infty$.
