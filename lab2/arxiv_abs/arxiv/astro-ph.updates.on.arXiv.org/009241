We present a blind method to determine the properties of a foreground contamination, given by a visibility
mask, that affects a deep galaxy survey. Angular cross correlations of density fields in different
redshift bins are expected to vanish (apart from a contribution due to lensing), but are sensitive
to the presence of a foreground that modulates the flux limit across the sky. After formalizing the
expected effect of a foreground mask on the measured galaxy density, under a linear, luminosity-dependent
bias model for galaxies, we construct two estimators that single out the mask contribution if a sufficient
number of independent redshift bins is available. These estimators are combined to give a reconstruction
of the mask. We use Milky-Way reddening as a prototype for the mask. Using a set of 20 large mock catalogs
covering $1/4$-th of the sky and number-matched to $H\alpha$ emitters to mimic an Euclid-like sample,
we demonstrate that our method can reconstruct the mask and its angular clustering at scales $\ell<100$,
beyond which the cosmological signal becomes dominant. The uncertainty of this reconstruction
is quantified to be $1/3$-rd of the sample variance of the signal. Such a reconstruction requires
knowledge of the average and square average of the mask, but we show that it is possible to recover
this information either from external models or internally from the data. It also relies on knowledge
of how the impact of the foreground changes with redshift (due to the extinction curve in our case),
but this can be tightly constrained by cross correlations of different redshift bins. The strong
points of this blind reconstruction technique lies in the ability to find "unknown unknowns" that
affect a survey, and in the facility to quantify, using sets of mock catalogs, how its uncertainty
propagates to clustering measurements. [Abridged]
