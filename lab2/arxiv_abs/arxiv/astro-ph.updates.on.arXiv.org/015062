We analyze a sample of 12 HST-selected edge-on protoplanetary disks for which the vertical extent
of the emission layers can be constrained directly. We present ALMA high angular resolution continuum
images (0.1arcsec) of these disks at two wavelengths, 0.89mm and 2.06mm (respectively ALMA bands
7 and 4), supplemented with archival band 6 data (1.33mm) where available. For most sources, the
millimeter continuum emission is more compact than the scattered light, both in the vertical and
radial directions. Six sources are resolved along their minor axis in at least one millimeter band,
providing direct information on the vertical distribution of the millimeter grains. For the second
largest disk of the sample, the significant difference in vertical extent between band 7 and band
4 suggests efficient size-selective vertical settling of large grains. Furthermore, the only
Class I object in our sample shows evidence of flaring in the millimeter. Along the major axis, all
disks are well resolved. Four of them are larger in band 7 than in band 4 in the radial direction, and
three have a similar radial extent in all bands. For all disks, we also derive the millimeter brightness
temperature and spectral index maps. We find that the disks are likely optically thick and that the
dust emission reveals low brightness temperatures in most cases (<10K). The integrated spectral
indices are similar to those of disks at lower inclination. The comparison of a generic radiative
transfer disk model with our data shows that at least 3 disks are consistent with a small millimeter
dust scale height, of a few au (measured at r=100au). This is in contrast with the more classical value
of h_g\sim10au derived from scattered light images and from gas line measurements. These results
confirm, by direct observations, that large (millimeter) grains are subject to significant vertical
settling in protoplanetary disks.
