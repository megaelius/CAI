We investigate the properties of bright galaxies with various morphological types in Abell 1139
and Abell 2589, using the pixel color-magnitude diagram (pCMD) analysis technique. The sample
is 32 galaxies brighter than Mr = -21.3 mag with spectroscopic redshifts, which are deeply imaged
in the g and r bands using the MegaCam mounted on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. After masking
contaminants with two-step procedures, we examine how the detailed properties in pCMDs depend
on galaxy morphology and infrared color. The mean g - r color as a function of surface brightness (mu_r)
in the pCMD of a galaxy shows fine performance in distinguishing between early- and late-type galaxies,
but it is not perfect because of the similarity between elliptical galaxies and bulge-dominated
spiral galaxies. On the other hand, the g - r color dispersion as a function of mu_r works better. We
find that the best set of parameters for galaxy classification is the combination of the minimum
color dispersion at mu_r <= 21.2 mag/arcsec^2 and the maximum color dispersion at 20.0 <= mu_r <=
21.0 mag/arcsec^2: the latter reflects the complexity of stellar populations at the disk component
in a typical spiral galaxy. Finally, the color dispersion measurements of an elliptical galaxy
appear to be correlated with the WISE infrared color ([4.6] - [12]). This indicates that the complexity
of stellar populations in an elliptical galaxy is related with its recent star formation activities.
From this observational evidence, we infer that gas-rich minor mergers or gas interactions may
have usually happened during the recent growth of massive elliptical galaxies.
