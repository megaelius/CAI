Inspiraling massive black-hole binaries (MBHBs) forming in the aftermath of galaxy mergers are
expected to be the loudest gravitational-wave (GW) sources relevant for pulsar-timing arrays
(PTAs) at nHz frequencies. The incoherent overlap of signals from a cosmic population of MBHBs gives
rise to a stochastic GW background (GWB) with characteristic strain around $h_c\sim10^{-15}$
at a reference frequency of 1 yr$^{-1}$, although uncertainties around this value are large. Current
PTAs are piercing into the GW amplitude range predicted by MBHB-population models, but no detection
has been reported so far. To assess the future success prospects of PTA experiments, it is therefore
important to estimate the minimum GWB level consistent with our current understanding of the formation
and evolution of galaxies and massive black holes (MBHs). To this purpose, we couple a semianalytic
model of galaxy evolution and an extensive study of the statistical outcome of triple MBH interactions.
We show that even in the most pessimistic scenario where all MBHBs stall before entering the GW-dominated
regime, triple interactions resulting from subsequent galaxy mergers inevitably drive a considerable
fraction of the MBHB population to coalescence. At frequencies relevant for PTA, the resulting
GWB is only a factor of 2-to-3 suppressed compared to a fiducial model where binaries are allowed
to merge over Gyr timescales. Coupled with current estimates of the expected GWB amplitude range,
our findings suggest that the minimum GWB from cosmic MBHBs is unlikely to be lower than $h_c\sim
10^{-16}$ (at $f = 1$ yr$^{-1}$), well within the expected sensitivity of projected PTAs based on
future observations with FAST, MeerKAT and SKA.
