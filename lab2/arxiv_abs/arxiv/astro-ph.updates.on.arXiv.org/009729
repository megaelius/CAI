The discovery of a transient kilonova following the gravitational-wave event GW170817 highlighted
the critical need for coordinated rapid and wide-field observations, inference, and follow-up
across the electromagnetic spectrum. In the Southern hemisphere, the Dark Energy Camera (DECam)
on the Blanco 4-m telescope is well-suited to this task, as it is able to cover wide-fields quickly
while still achieving the depths required to find kilonovae like the one accompanying GW170817
to $\sim$500 Mpc, the binary neutron star horizon distance for current generation of LIGO/Virgo
collaboration (LVC) interferometers. Here, as part of the multi-facility followup by the Global
Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) collaboration, we describe the observations
and automated data movement, data reduction, candidate discovery, and vetting pipeline of our
target-of-opportunity DECam observations of S190426c, the first possible neutron star--black
hole merger detected via gravitational waves. Starting 7.5hr after S190426c, over 11.28\,hr of
observations, we imaged an area of 525\,deg$^2$ ($r$-band) and 437\,deg$^2$ ($z$-band); this
was 16.3\% of the total original localization probability and nearly all of the probability density
visible from the Southern hemisphere. The machine-learning based pipeline was optimized for fast
turnaround, delivering transient candidates for human vetting within 17 minutes, on average,
of shutter closure. We reported nine promising counterpart candidates 2.5 hours before the end
of our observations. Our observations yielded no detection of a bona fide counterpart to $m_z = 22.5$
and $m_r = 22.9$ at the 5$\sigma$ level of significance, consistent with the refined LVC positioning.
We view these observations and rapid inferencing as an important real-world test for this novel
end-to-end wide-field pipeline.
