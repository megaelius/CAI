The level of mass segregation in the core of globular clusters has been previously proposed as a potential
indicator of the dynamical constituents of the system, such as presence of a significant population
of stellar-mass black holes (BHs), or even a central intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). However,
its measurement is limited to clusters with high-quality Hubble Space Telescope data. Thanks to
a set of state-of-the-art direct N-body simulations with up to 200k particles inclusive of stellar
evolution, primordial binaries, and varying BH/neutron stars, we highlight for the first time
the existence of a clear and tight linear relation between the degree of mass segregation and the
cluster structural concentration index. The latter is defined as the ratio of the radii containing
5% and 50% of the integrated light ($R_5/R_\mathrm{50}$), making it robustly measurable without
the need to individually resolve low-mass stars. Our simulations indicate that given $R_5/R_\mathrm{50}$,
the mass segregation $\Delta m$ (defined as the difference in main sequence median mass between
center and half-light radius) is expressed as $\Delta m/M_\odot = -1.166 R_5/R_\mathrm{h} + 0.3246$,
with a root-mean-square error of $0.0148$. In addition, we can explain its physical origin and the
values of the fitted parameters through basic analytical modeling. Such correlation is remarkably
robust against a variety of initial conditions (including presence of primordial binaries and
IMBHs) and cluster ages, with a slight dependence in best-fit parameters on the prescriptions used
to measure the quantities involved. Therefore, this study highlights the potential to develop
a new observational tool to gain insight on the dynamical status of globular clusters and on its dark
remnants.
