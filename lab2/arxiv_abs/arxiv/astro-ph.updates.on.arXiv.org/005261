A small fraction of quasars show unusually high nitrogen-to-carbon ratio (N/C) in their spectra.
These "nitrogen-rich" (N-rich) quasars are a long-standing puzzle because their interstellar
medium implies stellar populations with abnormally high metallicities. It has recently been proposed
that N-rich quasars may result from tidal disruption events (TDEs) of stars by supermassive black
holes. The rapid enhancement of nitrogen and the depletion of carbon due to the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen
cycle in supersolar mass stars could naturally produce high N/C. However, the TDE hypothesis predicts
that the N/C should change with time, which has never hitherto been observed. Here we report discovery
of the first N-rich quasar with rapid N/C variability that could be caused by a TDE. Two spectra separated
by 1.7 yr (rest-frame) show that the N III]\lambda 1750/C III]\lambda 1909 intensity ratio decayed
by ~86%+/-14% (1 \sigma). Optical (rest-frame UV) light curve and X-ray observations are qualitatively
consistent with the TDE hypothesis, although the time baseline falls short for a definitive proof.
Putting the single-object discovery into context, statistical analyses of the ~80 known N-rich
quasars with high-quality archival spectra show evidence (at a 5-\sigma\ significance level)
of a decrease in N/C on timescales of >1 yr (rest-frame) and a constant level of ionization (indicated
by the C III]\lambda 1909/C IV\lambda 1549 intensity ratio). If confirmed, our results demonstrate
the method of identifying TDE candidates in quasars via abundance ratio variability, opening a
new window of TDE observations at high redshift (z>2) with upcoming large-scale time-domain spectroscopic
surveys.
