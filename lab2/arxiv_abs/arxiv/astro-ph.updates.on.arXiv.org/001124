We present a model for the structure of the two-dimensional particle phase space average density
($P^2SAD$) in galactic haloes, introduced recently as a novel measure of the clustering of dark
matter ( arXiv:1308.1098 ). Our model is based on the stable clustering hypothesis in phase space,
the spherical collapse model, and tidal disruption of substructures, which is calibrated against
the high resolution Aquarius simulations. Using this physically motivated model, we are able to
predict the behaviour of ($P^2SAD$) in the numerically unresolved regime, down to the decoupling
mass limit of generic WIMP models. This prediction can be used to estimate signals sensitive to the
small scale structure of dark matter distributions. For example, the dark matter annihilation
rate is an integral over relative velocities of the product of a limit of $P^2SAD$ to zero separation
in physical space, and the annihilation cross section times the relative velocity. This provides
a convenient way to estimate the annihilation rate for arbitrary velocity-dependent cross sections.
We illustrate our method by computing the global and local subhalo annihilation boost to that of
the smooth dark matter distribution in a Milky-Way-size halo. Two cases are considered, one where
the cross section is velocity independent and one that approximates Sommerfeld-enhanced models.
We find that the global boost is $\sim10-30$, which is at the low end of current estimates (weakening
expectations of large extragalactic signals), while the boost at the solar radius is below the percent
level. We make our code to compute ($P^2SAD$) publicly available, which can be used to estimate various
observables that probe the nanostructure of dark matter haloes.
