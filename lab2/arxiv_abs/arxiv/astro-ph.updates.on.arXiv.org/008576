(Abridged) With the recent addition of a fringe-fitter, the Common Astronomy Software Application
(CASA) software suite, the current state of the art package for radio astronomy can now reduce VLBI
data. Here, we present the Radboud PIpeline for the Calibration of high Angular Resolution Data
(rPICARD) - an open-source VLBI calibration and imaging pipeline built on top of the CASA framework.
The pipeline is capable of reducing data from different VLBI arrays. It can be run non-interactively
after only a few non-default input parameters are set and deliver high-quality calibrated data.
CPU scalability based on a MPI implementation ensures fast computing times. Phase calibration
is done with a Schwab-Cotton fringe-fit algorithm. For the calibration of residual atmospheric
effects, optimal solution intervals are determined based on the SNR of the data for each scan. Different
solution intervals can be set for different antennas in the same scan to increase the number of detections
in the low SNR regime. These novel techniques allow rPICARD to calibrate data from different arrays,
including high-frequency and low-sensitivity arrays. The amplitude calibration is based on standard
telescope metadata and a robust algorithm can solve for atmospheric opacity attenuation in the
high frequency regime. Standard CASA tasks are used for CLEAN imaging and self-calibration. In
this work we demonstrate rPICARD's capabilities by calibrating and imaging 7 mm VLBA data of the
central radio source in the M87 galaxy. The reconstructed jet image reveals a complex collimation
profile and edge-brightened structure, in accordance with previous results. A potential counter-jet
is detected, having 10 % of the approaching jet's brightness, which constrains jet speeds close
to the radio core to about half the speed of light for small inclination angles.
