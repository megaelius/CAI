FK Comae is a rapidly rotating magnetically active star, the light curve of which is modulated by
cool spots on its surface. It was the first star where the "flip-flop" phenomenon was discovered.
Since then, flip-flops in the spot activity have been reported in many other stars. Therefore, it
is of interest to perform a more thorough study of the evolution of the spot activity in FK Com. In this
study, we analyse 15 years of photometric observations with two different time series analysis
methods, with a special emphasis on detecting flip-flop type events from the data. We apply the continuous
period search and carrier fit methods on long-term standard Johnson-Cousins V-observations from
the years 1995--2010. The observations were carried out with two automated photometric telescopes,
Phoenix-10 and Amadeus T7 located in Arizona. We identify complex phase behaviour in 6 of the 15 analysed
data segments. We identify five flip-flop events and two cases of phase jumps, where the phase shift
is \Delta \phi < 0.4. In addition we see two mergers of spot regions and two cases where the apparent
phase shifts are caused by spot regions drifting with respect to each other. Furthermore we detect
variations in the rotation period corresponding to a differential rotation coefficient of |k|>0.031.
The flip-flop cannot be interpreted as a single phenomenon, where the main activity jumps from one
active longitude to another. In some of our cases the phase shifts can be explained by differential
rotation: Two spot regions move with different angular velocity and even pass each other. Comparison
between the methods show that the carrier fit utility is better in retrieving slow evolution especially
from a low amplitude light curve, while the continuous period search is more sensitive in case of
rapid changes.
