We characterize the photometric and kinematic properties of simulated early-type galaxy (ETG)
stellar halos, and compare them to observations. We select a sample of ~1200 ETGs in the TNG100 and
TNG50 simulations, spanning a stellar mass range of $10^{10.3}-10^{12}M_{\odot}$ and within
the range of (g-r) colour and lambda-ellipticity diagram populated by observed ETGs. We determine
photometric parameters, intrinsic shapes, and kinematic observables in their extended stellar
halos. We study the variation in kinematics from center to halo and connect it to a change in the intrinsic
shape of the galaxies. We find that the simulated galaxy sample reproduces the diversity of kinematic
properties observed in ETG halos. Simulated fast rotators (FRs) divide almost evenly in one third
having flat lambda profiles and high halo rotational support, a third with gently decreasing profiles,
and another third with low halo rotation. Slow rotators (SRs) tend to have increased rotation in
the outskirts, with half of them exceeding lambda=0.2. For $M_{*}>10^{11.5}M_{\odot}$ halo rotation
is unimportant. A similar variety of properties is found for the stellar halo intrinsic shapes.
Rotational support and shape are deeply related: the kinematic transition to lower rotational
support is accompanied by a change towards rounder intrinsic shape. Triaxiality in the halos of
FRs increases outwards and with stellar mass. Simulated SRs have relatively constant triaxiality
profiles. Simulated stellar halos show a large variety of structural properties, with quantitative
but no clear qualitative differences between FRs and SRs. At the same stellar mass, stellar halo
properties show a gradual transition and significant overlap between the two families, despite
the clear bimodality in the central regions. This is in agreement with observations of extended
photometry and kinematics. [abridged]
