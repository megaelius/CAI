White dwarf stars constitute the final evolutionary stage for more than 95 per cent of all stars.
The Galactic population of white dwarfs conveys a wealth of information about several fundamental
issues and are of vital importance to study the structure, evolution and chemical enrichment of
our Galaxy and its components ---including the star formation history of the Milky Way. In addition,
white dwarfs are tracers of the evolution of planetary systems along several phases of stellar evolution.
Also, white dwarfs are used as laboratories for astro-particle physics, being their interest focused
on physics beyond the standard model. The last decade has witnessed a great progress in the study
of white dwarfs. In particular, a wealth of information of these stars from different surveys has
allowed us to make meaningful comparison of evolutionary models with observations. While some
information like surface chemical composition, temperature and gravity of isolated white dwarfs
can be inferred from spectroscopy, and the total mass and radius can be derived as well when they are
in binaries, the internal structure of these compact stars can be unveiled only by means of asteroseismology,
an approach based on the comparison between the observed pulsation periods of variable stars and
the periods predicted by appropriate theoretical models. The asteroseismological techniques
allow us to infer details of the internal chemical stratification, the total mass, and even the stellar
rotation profile. In this review, we first revise the evolutionary channels currently accepted
that lead to the formation of white-dwarf stars, and then, we give a detailed account of the different
sub-types of pulsating white dwarfs known so far, emphasizing the recent observational and theoretical
advancements in the study of these fascinating variable stars.
