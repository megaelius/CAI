We constrain $f(R)$ and chameleon-type modified gravity in the framework of the Berstchinger-Zukin
parametrization using the recent released Planck data, including both CMB temperature power spectrum
and lensing potential power spectrum. Some other external data sets are included, such as BAO measurements
from the 6dFGS, SDSS DR7 and BOSS DR9 surveys, HST $H_0$ measurement and supernovae from Union2.1
compilation. We also use WMAP9yr data for consistency check and comparison. For $f(R)$ gravity,
WMAP9yr results can only give quite a loose constraint on the modified gravity parameter $B_0$,
which is related to the present value of the Compton wavelength of the extra scalar degree of freedom,
$B_0<3.37$ at $95\% {\rm C.L.}$ We demonstrate that this constraint mainly comes from the late
ISW effect. With only Planck CMB temperature power-spectrum data, we can improve the WMAP9yr result
by a factor $3.7$ ($B_0<0.91$ at $95\% {\rm C.L.}$). If the Planck lensing potential power-spectrum
data are also taken into account, the constraint can be further strenghtened by a factor $5.1$ ($B_0<0.18$
at $95\% {\rm C.L.}$). This major improvement mainly comes from the small-scale lensing signal.
Furthermore, BAO, HST and supernovae data could slightly improve the $B_0$ bound ($B_0<0.12$
at $95\% {\rm C.L.}$).For the chameleon-type model, we find that the data set which we used cannot
constrain the Compton wavelength $B_0$ and the potential index $s$ of chameleon field, but can give
a tight constraint on the parameter $\beta_1=1.043^{+0.163}_{-0.104}$ at $95\% {\rm C.L.}$ ($\beta_1=1$
in general relativity), which accounts for the non-minimal coupling between the chameleon field
and the matter component. In addition, we find that both modified gravity models we considered favor
a relatively higher Hubble parameter than the concordance LCDM model in general relativity.
