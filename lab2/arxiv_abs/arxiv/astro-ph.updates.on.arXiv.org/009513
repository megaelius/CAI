We study the dynamical signatures of black hole (BH) and neutron star (NS) binary mergers via Lidov-Kozai
oscillations induced by tertiary companions in hierarchical triple systems. For each type of binaries
(BH-BH and BH-NS), we explore a wide range of binary/triple parameters that lead to binary mergers,
and determine the distributions of eccentricity ($e_\mathrm{m}$) and spin-orbit misalignment
angle ($\theta_\rm {sl}^\rm f$) when the binary enters the LIGO/VIRGO band. We use the double-averaged
(over both orbits) and single-averaged (over the inner orbit) secular equations, as well as N-body
integration, to evolve systems with different hierarchy levels, including the leading-order
post-Newtonian effect, spin-orbit coupling and gravitational radiation. We find that for merging
BH-BH binaries with comparable masses, about $7\%$ have $e_\mathrm{m}>0.1$ and $0.7\%$ have $e_{\rm
m}>0.9$. The majority of the mergers have significant eccentricities in the LISA band. The BH spin
evolution and $\theta_\rm {sl}^\rm f$ are correlated with the orbital evolution and $e_{\rm m}$.
Mergers with $e_{\rm m} \lesssim 10^{-3}$ have a distribution of $\theta_\rm {sl}^\rm f$ that peaks
around $90^\circ$ (and thus favoring a projected binary spin parameter $\chi_{\rm eff}\sim 0$),
while mergers with larger $e_{\rm m}$ have a more isotropic spin-orbit misalignments. For typical
BH-NS binaries, strong octuple effects lead to more mergers with non-negligible $e_\mathrm{m}$
(with $\sim 18\%$ having $e_\mathrm{m}>0.1$ and $2.5\%$ having $e_\mathrm{m}>0.9$), and the
final BH spin axis tends to be randomly orientated. Measurements or constraints on eccentric mergers
and $\theta_\rm {sl}^\rm f$ from LIGO/VIRGO and LISA would provide useful diagnostics on the dynamical
formation of merging BH or NS binaries in triples.
