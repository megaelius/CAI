We study a quiet-Sun blowout jet which is observed on 2014 May 16 by the instruments on board Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We find the twin CME as jet-like and bubble-like CME simultaneously
as observed by LASCO C2 on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO), Solar Terrestrial Relation
Observatory (STEREO A and STEREO B/COR2). They are respectively associated with the eruption of
the northern and southern sections of the filament. A circular filament is rooted at the internetwork
region at the base of the blowout jet. The collective magnetic cancellation is observed by SDO/HMI
line of sight (LOS) magnetograms at the northern end of the filament, which makes this filament unstable
and further makes it to erupt in two different stages. In the first stage, northern section of the
filament is ejected, and causes an evolution of the northern part of the blowout jet. This part of
the blowout jet is further extended as a collimated plasma beam to form a jet-like CME. We also observe
the plasma blobs at the northern edge of the blowout jet resulting from Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability
in its twisted magneto-plasma spire. In the second stage, southern section of the filament erupts
in form of deformed/twisted magnetic flux rope which forms the southern part of the blowout jet.
This eruption is most likely caused by the eruption of the northern section of filament, which removes
the confined magnetic field of the southern section of the filament. Alternative scenarios may
be a magnetic implosion between these magnetic structures confined in a much larger magnetic domain.
This eruption of southern section of the filament further results in the bubble-like CME in the outer
corona.
