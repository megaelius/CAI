We observe 14 young low-mass substellar objects in young moving groups using the SINFONI IFS with
LGS-AO to detect and characterize 3 candidate binary systems. Together with the adopted young moving
group ages we employ isochrones from substellar evolutionary models to estimate individual masses
for the binaries. We find 2MASS J15104786-2818174 to be part of the $\approx 30 - 50$ Myr Argus moving
group and composed of a $34 - 48\,M_{\rm Jup}$ primary brown dwarf with spectral type M$9\gamma$
and a fainter $15 - 22\, M_{\rm Jup}$ companion, separated by $\approx 100$ mas. 2MASS J22025794-5605087
is identified as an almost equal-mass binary in the AB Dor moving group, with a projected separation
of $\approx 60$ mas. Both components share spectral type M$9\gamma/\beta$, which with the adopted
age of $120 - 200$ Myr yields individual masses between $50 - 68\,M_{\rm Jup}$. The observations
of 2MASS J15474719-2423493 are of lesser quality and we obtain no spectral characterization for
the target, but resolve two components separated by $\approx 170$ mas which with the predicted young
field age of $30 - 50$ Myr yields individual masses below $20\,M_{\rm Jup}$. Out of the 3 candidate
binary systems, 2MASS J22025794-5605087 has unambiguous spectroscopic signs of being a bona-fide
binary, while the other two will require second-epoch confirmation. The small projected separations
between the binary components corresponds to physical separations of $\approx 4 - 7$ AU, allowing
for astrometric monitoring of just a few years in order to generate constrained orbital fits and
dynamical masses for the systems. In combination with their young ages, these binaries will prove
to be excellent benchmarks for calibrating substellar evolutionary models down to a very low-mass
regime.
