Photodisintegration reaction rates involving charged particles are of relevance to the p-process
nucleosynthesis that aims at explaining the production of the stable neutron-deficient nuclides
heavier than iron. In this study, the cross sections and astrophysical rates of (g,p) and (g,a) reactions
for about 3000 target nuclei with 10<Z<100 ranging from stable to proton dripline nuclei are computed.
To study the sensitivity of the calculations to the optical model potentials (OMPs), both the phenomenological
Woods-Saxon and the microscopic folding OMPs are taken into account. The systematic comparisons
show that the reaction rates, especially for the (g,a) reaction, are dramatically influenced by
the OMPs. Thus the better determination of the OMP is crucial to reduce the uncertainties of the photodisintegration
reaction rates involving charged particles. Meanwhile, a gamma-beam facility at ELI-NP is being
developed, which will open new opportunities to experimentally study the photodisintegration
reactions of astrophysics interest. Considering both the important reactions identified by the
nucleosynthesis studies and the purpose of complementing the experimental results for the reactions
involving p-nuclei, the measurements of six (g,p) and eight (g,a) reactions based on the gamma-beam
facility at ELI-NP and the ELISSA detector for the charged particles detection are proposed, and
the GEANT4 simulations are correspondingly performed. The minimum required energies of the gamma-beam
to measure these reactions are estimated. It is shown that the direct measurements of these photonuclear
reactions within the Gamow windows at T_9=2.5 for p-process are fairly feasible and promising at
ELI-NP. The expected experimental results will be used to constrain the OMPs of the charged particles,
which can eventually reduce the uncertainties of the reaction rates for the p-process nucleosynthesis.
