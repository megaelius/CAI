Context. Studying the spots of late-type stars is crucial for distinguishing between the various
proposed dynamo mechanisms believed to be the main cause of starspot activity. For this research
it is important to collect observation time series that are long enough to unravel both long- and
short-term spot evolution. Doppler imaging is a very efficient method for studying spots of stars
that cannot be angularly resolved. Aims. High-resolution spectral observations during 1994-2017
are analysed in order to reveal long- and short-term changes in the spot activity of the FK Comae-type
subgiant HD 199178. Methods. Most of the observations were collected with the Nordic Optical Telescope.
The Doppler imaging temperature maps were calculated using an inversion technique based on Tikhonov
regularisation and utilising multiple spectral lines. Results. We present a unique series of 41
temperature maps spanning more than 23 years. All reliable images show a large cool spot region centred
near the visible rotation pole. Some lower latitude cool features are also recovered, although
the reliability of these is questionable. There is an expected anti-correlation between the mean
surface temperature and the spot coverage. Using the Doppler images, we construct the equivalent
of a solar butterfly diagram for HD 199178. Conclusions. HD 199178 clearly has a long-term large
and cool spot structure at the rotational pole. This spot structure dominated the spot activity
during the years 1994-2017. The size and position of the structure has evolved with time, with a gradual
increase during the last years. The lack of lower latitude features prevents the determination
of a possible differential rotation.
