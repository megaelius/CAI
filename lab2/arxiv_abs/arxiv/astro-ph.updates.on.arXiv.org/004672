The Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA)-ENLIL+Cone model is used extensively in space weather operations
world-wide to model CME propagation. As such, it is important to assess its performance. We present
validation results of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model installed at the Community Coordinated Modeling
Center (CCMC) and executed in real-time by the CCMC space weather team. CCMC uses the WSA-ENLIL+Cone
model to predict CME arrivals at NASA missions throughout the inner heliosphere. In this work we
compare model predicted CME arrival-times to in-situ ICME leading edge measurements at STEREO-A,
STEREO-B, and Earth (Wind and ACE) for simulations completed between March 2010-December 2016
(over 1,800 CMEs). We report hit, miss, false alarm, and correct rejection statistics for all three
locations. For all predicted CME arrivals, the hit rate is 0.5, and the false alarm rate is 0.1. For
the 273 events where the CME was predicted to arrive at Earth, STEREO-A, or STEREO-B, and was actually
observed (hit event), the mean absolute arrival-time prediction error was 10.4 +/- 0.9 hours, with
a tendency to early prediction error of -4.0 hours. We show the dependence of the arrival-time error
on CME input parameters. We also explore the impact of the multi-spacecraft observations used to
initialize the model CME inputs by comparing model verification results before and after the STEREO-B
communication loss (since September 2014) and STEREO-A sidelobe operations (August 2014-December
2015). There is an increase of 1.7 hours in the CME arrival time error during single, or limited two-viewpoint
periods, compared to the three-spacecraft viewpoint period. This trend would apply to a future
space weather mission at L5 or L4 as another coronagraph viewpoint to reduce CME arrival time errors
compared to a single L1 viewpoint.
