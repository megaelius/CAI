Non-attractor inflation is known as the only single field inflationary scenario that can violate
non-Gaussianity consistency relation with the Bunch-Davies vacuum state and generate large local
non-Gaussianity. However, it is also known that the non-attractor inflation by itself is incomplete
and should be followed by a phase of slow-roll attractor. Moreover, there is a transition process
between these two phases. In the past literature, this transition was approximated as instant and
the evolution of non-Gaussianity in this phase was not fully studied. In this paper, we follow the
detailed evolution of the non-Gaussianity through the transition phase into the slow-roll attractor
phase, considering different types of transition. We find that the transition process has important
effect on the size of the local non-Gaussianity. We first compute the net contribution of the non-Gaussianities
at the end of inflation in canonical non-attractor models. If the curvature perturbations keep
evolving during the transition - such as in the case of smooth transition or some sharp transition
scenarios - the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ local non-Gaussianity generated in the non-attractor phase
can be completely erased by the subsequent evolution, although the consistency relation remains
violated. In extremal cases of sharp transition where the super-horizon modes freeze immediately
right after the end of the non-attractor phase, the original non-attractor result can be recovered.
We also study models with non-canonical kinetic terms, and find that the transition can typically
contribute a suppression factor in the squeezed bispectrum, but the final local non-Gaussianity
can still be made parametrically large.
