We present the stellar and ionized gas kinematics of 13 bright peculiar Virgo cluster galaxies observed
with the DensePak Integral Field Unit at the WIYN 3.5-meter telescope, to seek kinematic evidence
that these galaxies have experienced gravitational interactions or gas stripping. 2-Dimensional
maps of the stellar velocity $V$, and stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma$ and the ionized gas velocity
(H$\beta$ and/or [\ion{O}{3}]) are presented for galaxies in the sample. The stellar rotation
curves and velocity dispersion profiles are determined for 13 galaxies, and the ionized gas rotation
curves are determined for 6 galaxies. Misalignments between the optical and kinematical major
axis are found in several galaxies. While in some cases this is due to a bar, in other cases it seems
associated with a gravitational interaction or ongoing ram pressure stripping. Non-circular
gas motions are found in nine galaxies, with various causes including bars, nuclear outflows, or
gravitational disturbances. Several galaxies have signatures of kinematically distinct stellar
components, which are likely signatures of accretion or mergers. We compute for all galaxies the
angular momentum parameter $\lambda_{\rm R}$. An evaluation of the galaxies in the $\lambda_{\rm
R}$-ellipticity plane shows that all but 2 of the galaxies have significant support from random
stellar motions, and have likely experienced gravitational interactions. This includes some
galaxies with very small bulges and truncated/compact H$\alpha$ morphologies, indicating that
such galaxies cannot be fully explained by simple ram pressure stripping, but must have had significant
gravitational encounters. Most of the sample galaxies show evidence for ICM-ISM stripping as well
as gravitational interactions, indicating that the evolution of a significant fraction of cluster
galaxies is likely strongly impacted by both effects.
