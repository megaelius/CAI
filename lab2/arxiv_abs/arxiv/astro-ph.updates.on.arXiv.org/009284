We present velocities of galactic outflows in seven star-forming galaxies at $z=$5-6 with a stellar
mass of $M_* \sim10^{10.1}\ \rm{M_\odot}$. Although it is challenging to observationally determine
the outflow velocities, we overcome this challenge by making use of the ALMA [CII]158 $\mu$m emission
lines for systemic velocities and the deep Keck spectra with metal absorption lines for velocity
profiles available to date. We construct a composite Keck spectrum of the galaxies at $z=$5-6 with
the [CII]-systemic velocities, and fit outflow-line profiles to the SiII1260, CII1335, and SiIV1394,1403
absorption lines in the composite spectrum. We measure the maximum (90%) outflow velocity $v_\rm{max}$
and the central outflow velocity $v_\rm{out}$ to be $v_\rm{max}=810^{+140}_{-160}\ \rm{km\
s^{-1}}$ and $v_\rm{out} = 440^{+110}_{-140}\ \rm{km\ s^{-1}}$ on average, respectively. For
$M_* \sim10^{10.1}\ \rm{M_\odot}$, we find the redshift evolution that the $v_\rm{max}$ value
of our $z=$5-6 galaxies is higher than those of $z=0$ galaxies by a factor of 3.5 and comparable to
the one of $z=2$ galaxies. Estimating the halo circular velocity $v_\rm{cir}$ from the stellar
masses and the abundance matching results, we investigate a $v_\rm{max}$-$v_\rm{cir}$ relation.
Interestingly, $v_\rm{max}$ for galaxies with $M_*=10^{10.0-10.8}\ \rm{M_\odot}$ shows a clear
positive correlation with $v_\rm{cir}$ (as well as the star-formation rate) over $z=$0-6 with
small scatters of $\simeq \pm 0.1$ dex, which is in good agreement with the theoretical predictions
(Muratov et al. 2015). This positive correlation suggests that the outflow velocity is physically
related to the halo circular velocity corresponding to the depth of the gravitational potential,
and that the redshift evolution of $v_\rm{max}$ is explained by the increase of $v_\rm{cir}$ toward
high redshift.
