The large-scale magnetic fields detected at the surface of about 10% of hot stars extend into the
stellar interior, where they may alter the structure. Deep inner regions of stars are only observable
using asteroseismology. Here, we investigated the pulsating magnetic B3.5V star HD43317, inferred
its interior properties and assessed whether the dipolar magnetic field with a surface strength
of $B_p = 1312 \pm 332$G caused different properties compared to those of non-magnetic stars. We
analysed the latest version of the star's 150d CoRoT light curve and extracted 35 significant frequencies,
28 of which were determined to be independent and not related to the known surface rotation period
of $P_{\rm rot} = 0.897673$d. We performed forward seismic modelling based on non-magnetic, non-rotating
1D MESA models and the adiabatic module of the pulsation code GYRE, utilizing a grid-based approach.
Our aim was to estimate the stellar mass, age, and convective core overshooting. The GYRE calculations
were done for uniform rotation with $P_{\rm rot}$. This modelling was able to explain 16 of the 28
frequencies as gravity modes belonging to retrograde modes with $(\ell, m) = (1, -1)$ and $(2, -1)$
period spacing patterns and one distinct prograde $(2,2)$ mode. The modelling resulted in a stellar
mass $M_{\star} = 5.8^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$$\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, a central hydrogen mass fraction
$X_c = 0.54^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$, and exponential convective core overshooting parameter $f_{\rm
ov} = 0.004^{+0.014}_{-0.002}$. The low value for $f_{\rm ov}$ is compatible with the suppression
of near-core mixing due to a magnetic field but the uncertainties are too large to pinpoint such suppression
as the sole physical interpretation. $[...]$
