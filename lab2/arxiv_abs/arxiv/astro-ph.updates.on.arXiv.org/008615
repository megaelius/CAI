We describe a novel method for the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to fields
defined on the sphere, using the HEALPix tessellation scheme. Specifically, We have developed
a pixel-based approach to implement convolutional layers on the spherical surface, similarly
to what is commonly done for CNNs in Euclidian space. The algorithm is fully integrable with existing
libraries for NNs (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow). We present two applications: (i) recognition
of handwritten digits projected on the sphere; (ii) estimation of cosmological parameter from
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) simulated maps. We have built a simple NN architecture, consisting
in four convolutional+pooling layers, and have used it for all the applications explored herein.
For what concerns the handwritten digits, our CNN reaches an accuracy of about 95%, comparable with
other existing spherical CNNs. For CMB applications, we have tested the CNN on the estimation of
a "mock" parameter, defining the angular scale at which the power spectrum of a Gaussian field projected
on the sphere peaks. We have estimated this parameter directly from maps, in several cases: temperature
and polarization, presence of noise and partial sky coverage. In all the cases, the NN performances
are comparable with those from standard spectrum-based bayesian methods. We demonstrate, for
the first time, the capability of CNNs to extract information from polarization fields and to distinguish
between E and B-modes. Lastly, we have applied our CNN to the estimation of the Thomson scattering
optical depth at reionization (tau) from simulated CMB maps. Even without any specific optimization
of the NN architecture, we reach an accuracy comparable with standard bayesian methods. This work
represents a first step towards the exploitation of NNs in CMB parameter estimation and demonstrates
the feasibility of our approach.
