Estimation of parameters of the standard model of cosmology have dramatically improved due to increasingly
exquisite measurements made by Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments. Recent data from
Planck matches well with the minimal $\Lambda$CDM model. A likelihood analysis using Planck, WMAP
and a selection of high resolution experiments (highL), tensor to scalar ratio $r$ is found to be
$<0.11$ when $dn_{s}/d\ln k = 0$. Planck also imposes an upper bound on neutrino mass $\sum m_\nu<0.23\,$eV
using Planck+WMAP+highL+BAO likelihood. However, recently results from BICEP 2 claims the detection
of $r= 0.2$ from polarization data. Further, results from SDSS-III BOSS constrains the total neutrino
mass to $\sum m_\nu=0.36$ eV. It is important to study the consequences of these new measurements
on other cosmological parameters. The sensitive of Planck to the weak lensing effect on the CMB angular
power spectrum suggests that the normalized amplitude of physical lensing power $A_L>1$ at
$2\sigma$ hinting at a potentially important internal inconsistency. Therefore, we also include
a study of the constraints on $A_L$. Using the prior on $r$ and $\sum m_\nu$ as measured by BICEP 2 and
SDSS-III BOSS respectively, we find that the model with running spectral index ($dn_{s}/d\ln k
\neq 0$) leads to a value of $A_L>1$ at $3.27\sigma$. But, the model with $dn_{s}/d\ln k =0$ makes
$A_L$ consistent with $1$, at $2.67\sigma$ and also shows that $N_{\rm eff}$ is consistent with
its theoretical value of $3.046$. However, the value of $H_0$ for this case is lower and more discrepant
from value measured from high redshift supernova measurements, which can increase if the measurement
on $\sum m_\nu$ decreases, without effecting $N_{\rm eff}$ and $A_L$ significantly. Therefore,
the analysis in this paper shows that the model with $dn_{s}/d\ln k =0$ is consistent on all theoretical
aspects [abridged] .
