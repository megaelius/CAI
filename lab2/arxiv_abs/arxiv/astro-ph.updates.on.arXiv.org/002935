To reionize the early universe, high-energy photons must escape the galaxies that produce them.
It has been suggested that stellar feedback drives galactic outflows out of star-forming regions,
creating low density channels through which ionizing photons escape into the inter-galactic medium.
We compare the galactic outflow properties of confirmed Lyman continuum (LyC) leaking galaxies
to a control sample of nearby star-forming galaxies to explore whether the outflows from leakers
are extreme as compared to the control sample. We use data from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on
the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the equivalent widths and velocities of Si II and Si III absorption
lines, tracing neutral and ionized galactic outflows. We find that the Si II and Si III equivalent
widths of the LyC leakers reside on the low-end of the trend established by the control sample. The
leakers' velocities are not statistically different than the control sample, but their absorption
line profiles have a different asymmetry: their central velocities are closer to their maximum
velocities. The outflow kinematics and equivalent widths are consistent with the scaling relations
between outflow properties and host galaxy properties -- most notably metallicity -- defined by
the control sample. Additionally, we use the Ly\alpha\ profiles to show that the Si II equivalent
width scales with the Ly\alpha\ peak velocity separation. We determine that the low equivalent
widths of the leakers are likely driven by low metallicities and low H I column densities, consistent
with a density-bounded ionization region, although we cannot rule out significant variations
in covering fraction. While we do not find that the LyC leakers have extreme outflow velocities,
the low maximum-to-central velocity ratios demonstrate the importance of the acceleration and
density profiles for LyC and Ly\alpha\ escape. [abridged]
