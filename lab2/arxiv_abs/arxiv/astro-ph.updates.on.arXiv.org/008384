The LambdaCDM model of cosmology, though very successful at large scales, has some discrepancy
with observations at the galactic and sub-galactic scales. These include the core-cusp problem,
missing satellites problem etc. Spergel and Steingardt (2000) proposed that if dark matter undergoes
feeble self interactions with each other, then such problems can be averted. In this thesis, a two-component
Feebly Interacting Massive Particle (FIMP) dark matter model involving two singlet scalar fields
capable of self-interactions has been proposed and its impact on large scale structure formation
has been studied through cosmological simulations. The proposed model involves simple extensions
of the Standard Model with two singlet scalar fields formed non-thermally through the decay of heavier
particles in the very early universe. These particles acquire their relic abundance through a freeze-in
mechanism. The coupled Boltzmann equation of the FIMP-FIMP model was solved and the relic densities
for different values of the coupling parameters were obtained and matched with PLANCK results.
The impact of dark matter self interactions was studied through cosmological simulations using
a modified version of the parallel TreePM code GADGET-2 and the halo mass function and halo catalog
for different dark matter self interaction cross sections were obtained. Lastly, the newly developed
Effective Theory of Structure Formation (ETHOS) framework which is a new and innovative paradigm
in the study of the cosmological effects of different dark matter models was studied and using the
public code, ETHOS-CAMB the signatures of dark acoustic oscillations in the matter power spectrum
for a particular dark matter model was obtained.
