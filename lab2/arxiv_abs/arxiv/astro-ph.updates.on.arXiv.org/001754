We present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as a function of redshift
for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the Planck SZ (PSZ) catalogue. The PSZ is selected through
the signature of the Sunyaev--Zeldovich (SZ) effect, and the sub-sample used here has a signal-to-noise
threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster and all but one with a redshift estimate.
We discuss the completeness of the sample and our construction of a likelihood analysis. Using a
relation between mass $M$ and SZ signal $Y$ calibrated to X-ray measurements, we derive constraints
on the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$ and matter density parameter $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$
in a flat $\Lambda$CDM model. We test the robustness of our estimates and find that possible biases
in the $Y$--$M$ relation and the halo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties
from the cluster sample. Assuming the X-ray determined mass to be biased low relative to the true
mass by between zero and 30%, motivated by comparison of the observed mass scaling relations to those
from a set of numerical simulations, we find that $\sigma_8=0.75\pm 0.03$, $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}=0.29\pm
0.02$, and $\sigma_8(\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3} = 0.764 \pm 0.025$. The value of $\sigma_8$
is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a value of 20% we find $\sigma_8(\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3}=0.78\pm
0.01$ and a tighter one-dimensional range $\sigma_8=0.77\pm 0.02$. We find that the larger values
of $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ preferred by Planck's measurements of the primary CMB
anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass bias of about 40%. Alternatively, consistency with the
primary CMB constraints can be achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scales
relative to the $\Lambda$CDM model, such as a component of massive neutrinos (abridged).
