We present very early ground-based optical follow-up observations of GRB~140423A, which was discovered
by \emph{Swift}/BAT and by {\it Fermi}/GBM. Its broadband afterglow was monitored by {\it Swift}/XRT
and ground-based optical telescopes from $T_0+$70.96~s to 4.8~d after the {\it Swift}/BAT trigger.
This is one more case of prompt optical emission observation. The temporal and spectral joint fit
of the multiwavelength light curves of GRB 140423A reveals that achromatic behavior is consistent
with the external shock model including a transition from a stellar wind to the interstellar medium
(ISM) and energy injection. In terms of the optical light curves, there is an onset bump in the early
afterglow with a rising index $\alpha_{\rm O,I} = -0.59 \pm 0.04$ (peaking at $t_{\rm peak}-T_0
\approx 206$~s). It then decays with a steep index $\alpha_{\rm O,II} = 1.78 \pm 0.03$, and shows
a steeper to flatter "transition" with $\alpha_{\rm O,III} = 1.13 \pm 0.03$ at around $T_0 + 5000$~s.
The observed X-ray afterglow reflects an achromatic behavior, as does the optical light curve.
There is no obvious evolution of the spectral energy distribution between the X-ray and optical
afterglow, with an average value of the photon index $\Gamma \approx 1.95$. This "transition" is
consistent with an external shock model having the circumburst medium transition from a wind to
the ISM, by introducing a long-lasting energy injection with a Lorentz factor stratification of
the ejecta. The best parameters from Monte Carlo Markov Chain fitting are $E_{\rm K,iso} \approx
2.14\times10^{55}$ erg, $\Gamma_0 \approx 162$, $\epsilon_e \approx 0.02$, $\epsilon_B \approx
1.7\times10^{-6}$, $A_\ast \approx 1.0$, $R_t \approx 4.1\times10^{17}$ cm, $n \approx 11.0
\rm\ cm^{-3}$, $L_0 \approx 3.1\times10^{52} \rm\ erg\ s^{-1}$, $k \approx 1.98$, $s \approx 1.54$,
and $\theta_j > 0.3$ rad.
