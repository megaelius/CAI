Using N-body simulations we study the origin of prolate rotation recently detected in the kinematic
data for And II, a dSph satellite of M31. We propose an evolutionary model for the origin of And II involving
a merger between two disky dwarf galaxies whose structural parameters differ only in their disk
scale lengths. The dwarfs are placed on a radial orbit towards each other with their angular momenta
inclined by 45 deg to the orbital plane and by 90 deg with respect to each other. After 5 Gyr of evolution
the merger remnant forms a stable triaxial galaxy with rotation only around the longest axis. The
origin of this rotation is naturally explained as due to the symmetry of the initial configuration
which leads to the conservation of angular momentum components along the direction of the merger.
The stars originating from the two dwarfs show significantly different surface density profiles
while having very similar kinematics in agreement with the properties of separate stellar populations
in And II. We also study an alternative scenario for the formation of And II, via tidal stirring of
a disky dwarf galaxy. While intrinsic rotation occurs naturally in this model as a remnant of the
initial rotation of the disk, it is mostly around the shortest axis of the stellar component. The
rotation around the longest axis is induced only occasionally and remains much smaller that the
system's velocity dispersion. We conclude that although tidal origin of the velocity distribution
in And II cannot be excluded, it is much more naturally explained within the scenario involving a
past merger event. Thus, in principle, the presence of prolate rotation in dSph galaxies of the Local
Group and beyond may be used as an indicator of major mergers in their history or even as a way to distinguish
between the two scenarios of their formation.
