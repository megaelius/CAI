(ABRIDGED)The rise of cosmic structure depends upon the statistical distribution of initial density
fluctuations generated by inflation. While the simplest models predict an almost perfectly Gaussian
distribution, more-general models predict a level of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) that observations
might yet be sensitive enough to detect. Recent Planck Collaboration measurements of the CMB temperature
anisotropy bispectrum significantly tighten the observational limits, but they are still far
from the PNG level predicted by the simplest models of inflation. Probing levels below CMB sensitivities
will require other methods, such as searching for the statistical imprint of PNG on galactic halo
clustering. During the epoch of reionization (EoR), the first stars and galaxies released radiation
into the intergalactic medium (IGM) that created ionized patches whose large-scale geometry and
evolution reflected the underlying abundance and large-scale clustering of the star-forming
galaxies. This statistical connection between ionized patches in the IGM and galactic halos suggests
that observing reionization may be another way to constrain PNG. We employ the linear perturbation
theory of reionization and semi-analytic models based on the excursion-set formalism to model
the effects of PNG on the EoR. We quantify the effects of PNG on the large-scale structure of reionization
by deriving the ionized density bias, i.e. ratio of ionized atomic to total matter overdensities
in Fourier space, at small wavenumber. Just as previous studies found that PNG creates a scale-dependent
signature in the halo bias, so, too, we find a scale-dependent signature in the ionized density bias.
Our results, which differ significantly from previous attempts in the literature to characterize
this PNG signature, will be applied elsewhere to predict its observable consequences, e.g. in the
cosmic 21cm background.
