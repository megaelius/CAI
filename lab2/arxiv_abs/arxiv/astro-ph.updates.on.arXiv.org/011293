Hickson Compact Group (HCG) 16 is a prototypical compact group of galaxies, apparently in an intermediate
stage of evolution, where its galaxies are losing gas to the intra-group medium (IGrM). The wide
variety of ongoing process in HCG 16 make it an ideal case study for exploring which processes are
likely to dominate the late stages of evolution in compact groups. In order to build a coherent picture
of the evolution of this group we make use of the multi-wavelength data available, but focus particularly
on HI as a tracer of interactions and evolutionary phase. We reprocess archival VLA L-band data of
HCG 16 using the multi-scale CLEAN algorithm to accurately recover diffuse features. Despite the
clear disruption of the HI component of HCG 16 we find that it is not globally HI deficient, even though
HCG 16a and b have lost the majority of their HI and almost 50% of the group's HI is in the IGrM, including
a 160 kpc long tail extending towards the SE. This study indicates that in the recent past (~1 Gyr)
galaxies HCG 16a and b likely underwent major interactions that unbound gas without triggering
significant star formation. This gas was then swept away by a high speed, close encounter with NGC
848. The starburst events HCG 16c and d have triggered galactic winds which, in the case of HCG 16d,
appears to have disrupted its HI reservoir. The tidal features still connected to these galaxies
indicate that more HI will soon be lost to the IGrM, while that which remains in the discs will likely
be consumed by star formation episodes. This is expected to result in a collection of gas-poor galaxies
embedded in a diffuse HI structure, which will gradually be evaporated by the UV background, resembling
the final stage of the evolutionary model of compact groups. This work is accompanied by a complete
workflow to reproduce the final data products, intended to improve reproducibility. (Abridged)
