We examine the clustering and kinematics of young stellar objects (YSOs) in the North America/Pelican
Nebulae, as revealed by Gaia astrometry, in relation to the structure and motions of the molecular
gas, as indicated in molecular line maps. The Gaia parallaxes and proper motions allow us to significantly
refine previously published lists of YSOs, demonstrating that many of the objects previously thought
to form a distributed population turn out to be non-members. The members are subdivided into at least
6 spatio-kinematic groups, each of which is associated with its own molecular cloud component or
components. Three of the groups are expanding, with velocity gradients of 0.3-0.5 km/s/pc, up to
maximum velocities of ~8 km/s away from the groups' centers. The two known O-type stars associated
with the region, 2MASS J20555125+4352246 and HD 199579, are rapidly escaping one of these groups,
following the same position-velocity relation as the low-mass stars. We calculate that a combination
of gas expulsion and tidal forces from the clumpy distribution of molecular gas could impart the
observed velocity gradients within the groups. However, on a global scale, the relative motions
of the groups do not appear either divergent or convergent. The velocity dispersion of the whole
system is consistent with the kinetic energy gained due to gravitational collapse of the complex.
Most of the stellar population has ages similar to the free-fall timescales for the natal clouds.
Thus, we suggest the nearly free-fall collapse of a turbulent molecular cloud as the most likely
scenario for star formation in this complex.
