In response to the need for the Astro2020 Decadal Survey to explicitly engage early career astronomers,
the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine hosted the Early Career Astronomer
and Astrophysicist Focus Session (ECFS) on October 8-9, 2018 under the auspices of Committee of
Astronomy and Astrophysics. The meeting was attended by fifty six pre-tenure faculty, research
scientists, postdoctoral scholars, and senior graduate students, as well as eight former decadal
survey committee members, who acted as facilitators. The event was designed to educate early career
astronomers about the decadal survey process, to solicit their feedback on the role that early career
astronomers should play in Astro2020, and to provide a forum for the discussion of a wide range of
topics regarding the astrophysics career path. This white paper presents highlights and themes
that emerged during two days of discussion. In Section 1, we discuss concerns that emerged regarding
the coming decade and the astrophysics career path, as well as specific recommendations from participants
regarding how to address them. We have organized these concerns and suggestions into five broad
themes. These include (sequentially): (1) adequately training astronomers in the statistical
and computational techniques necessary in an era of "big data", (2) responses to the growth of collaborations
and telescopes, (3) concerns about the adequacy of graduate and postdoctoral training, (4) the
need for improvements in equity and inclusion in astronomy, and (5) smoothing and facilitating
transitions between early career stages. Section 2 is focused on ideas regarding the decadal survey
itself, including: incorporating early career voices, ensuring diverse input from a variety of
stakeholders, and successfully and broadly disseminating the results of the survey.
