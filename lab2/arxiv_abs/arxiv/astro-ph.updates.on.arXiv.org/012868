Complex organic molecules (COMs) have been identified toward high- and low-mass protostars as
well as molecular clouds, suggesting that these interstellar species originate from the early
stage(s) of starformation. The reaction pathways resulting in COMs described by the formula C$_2$H$_\text{n}$O
are still under debate. In this work, we investigate the laboratory possible solid-state reactions
that involve simple hydrocarbons and OH-radicals along with H$_2$O ice under translucent cloud
conditions (1$\leq$A$_V$$\leq$5 and \textit{n}$_\text{H}$$\sim$10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$). We focus
on the interactions of C$_2$H$_2$ with H-atoms and OH-radicals, which are produced along the H$_2$O
formation sequence on grain surfaces at 10 K. Ultra-high vacuum (UHV) experiments were performed
to study the surface chemistry observed during C$_2$H$_2$ + O$_2$ + H codeposition, where O$_2$
was used for the in-situ generation of OH-radicals. Reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy
(RAIRS) was applied to in situ monitor the initial and newly formed species. After that, a temperature-programmed
desorption experiment combined with a Quadrupole mass spectrometer (TPD-QMS) was used as a complementary
analytical tool. The investigated 10 K surface chemistry of C$_2$H$_2$ with H-atoms and OH-radicals
not only results in semi and fully saturated hydrocarbons, such as ethylene (C$_2$H$_4$) and ethane
(C$_2$H$_6$), but it also leads to the formation of COMs, such as vinyl alcohol, acetaldehyde, ketene,
ethanol, and possibly acetic acid. It is concluded that OH-radical addition reactions to C$_2$H$_2$,
acting as a molecular backbone, followed by isomerization (i.e., keto-enol tautomerization)
via an intermolecular pathway and successive hydrogenation provides a so far experimentally unreported
solid-state route for the formation of these species without the need of energetic input.
