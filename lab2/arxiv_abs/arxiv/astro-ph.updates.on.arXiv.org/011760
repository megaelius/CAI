We study the correlation of orbital poles of the 11 classical satellite galaxies of the Milky Way,
comparing results from previous proper motions with the independent data by Gaia DR2. Previous
results on the degree of correlation and its significance are confirmed by the new data. A majority
of the satellites co-orbit along the Vast Polar Structure, the plane (or disk) of satellite galaxies
defined by their positions. The orbital planes of eight satellites align to $<20^\circ$ with a common
direction, seven even orbit in the same sense. Most also share similar specific angular momenta,
though their wide distribution on the sky does not support a recent group infall or satellites-of-satellites
origin. The orbital pole concentration has continuously increased as more precise proper motions
were measured, as expected if the underlying distribution shows true correlation that is washed
out by observational uncertainties. The orbital poles of the up to seven most correlated satellites
are in fact almost as concentrated as expected for the best-possible orbital alignment achievable
given the satellite positions. Combining the best-available proper motions substantially increases
the tension with $\Lambda$CDM cosmological expectations: <0.1 per cent of simulated satellite
systems in IllustrisTNG contain seven orbital poles as closely aligned as observed. Simulated
systems that simultaneously reproduce the concentration of orbital poles and the flattening of
the satellite distribution have a frequency of <0.1 per cent for any number of k > 3 combined orbital
poles, indicating that these results are not affected by a look-elsewhere effect. This compounds
the Planes of Satellite Galaxies Problem.
