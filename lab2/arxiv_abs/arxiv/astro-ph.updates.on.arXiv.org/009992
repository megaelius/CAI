The occurrence of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the gas phase at low temperature in the dense
phases of the ISM suggests that a non-thermal desorption mechanism is at work because otherwise,
COMs should condense within a short timescale onto dust grains. Vacuum ultraviolet photodesorption
has been shown to be much less efficient for complex organic molecules, such as methanol, because
mostly photoproducts are ejected. The induced photolysis competes with photodesorption for large
COMs, considerably lowering the efficiency to desorb intact molecules. We investigate the sputtering
efficiency of complex organic molecules that are observed either in the ice mantles of interstellar
dense clouds directly by infrared spectroscopy (CH3OH), or that are observed in the gas phase by
millimeter telescopes (CH3COOCH3) and that could be released from interstellar grain surfaces.
We irradiated ice films containing complex organic molecules (methanol and methyl acetate) and
water with swift heavy ions in the electronic sputtering regime. We monitored the infrared spectra
of the film as well as the species released to the gas phase with a mass spectrometer. We demonstrate
that when methanol or methyl acetate is embedded in a water-ice mantle exposed to cosmic rays, a large
portion is sputtered as an intact molecule, with a sputtering yield close to that of the main water-ice
matrix. This must be even more true for more volatile ice matrices, such as those that are embedded
in carbon monoxide. Cosmic rays penetrating deep into dense clouds provide an efficient mechanism
to desorb complex organic molecules. Compared to VUV photons induced by the interaction of cosmic
rays, a large portion desorb as intact molecules with a proportion corresponding to the time-dependent
bulk composition of the ice mantle, the latter evolving with time as a function of fluence due to the
radiolysis of the bulk.
