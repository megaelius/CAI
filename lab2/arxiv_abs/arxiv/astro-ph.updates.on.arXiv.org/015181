Modeling of gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission spectra sometimes requires a (quasi-) thermal
spectral component in addition to the Band function. In photospheric emission models, a prominent
thermal component broadened by sub-photospheric dissipation is expected to be released at the
photospheric radius, $r_{\rm ph}\sim10^{12}\,$cm. We consider an ultra-relativistic strongly
magnetized outflow with a striped-wind magnetic-field structure undergoing gradual and continuous
magnetic energy dissipation at $r<r_s$ that heats and accelerates the flow, leading to a bulk Lorentz
factor $\Gamma(r)=\Gamma_\infty\min[1,(r/r_s)^{1/3}]$, where typically $r_{\rm ph}<r_s$.
Similar dynamics and energy dissipation rates are also expected in highly-variable magnetized
outflows without stripes/field-reversals. Two modes of particle energy injection are considered:
(a) power-law electrons, e.g. accelerated by magnetic reconnection, and (b) continuous distributed
heating of all electrons (and $e^\pm$-pairs), e.g. due to MHD instabilities. Time-resolved energy
spectra are obtained using a numerical code that evolves coupled kinetic equations for a photon-electron-positron
plasma. We find that (i) the thermal component peaks at $(1+z)E_{\rm pk}\sim0.2-1\,$MeV, for a
source at redshift $z$, and becomes subdominant if the total injected energy density exceeds the
thermal one, (ii) power-law electrons cool mainly by synchrotron emission whereas mildly relativistic
and almost monoenergetic electrons in the distributed heating scenario cool by Comptonization
on thermal peak photons, (iii) both scenarios can yield a low-energy break at $E_{\rm br}\approx
E_{\rm th}$, and (iv) the $0.5(1+z)^{-1}\,$keV X-ray emission is suppressed in the power-law injection
case, but it is expected for the distributed heating scenario. Energy-dependent linear polarization
can differentiate between the two energy injection cases.
