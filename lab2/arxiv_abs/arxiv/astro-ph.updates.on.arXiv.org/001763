Context. Thanks to the heroic observational campaigns carried out in recent years we now have large
samples of metal-poor stars for which measurements of detailed abundances exist. [...] These data
hold important clues on the nature of the contribution of the first stellar generations to the enrichment
of our Galaxy. Aims. We aim to explain the scatter in Sr, Ba, Y, and Eu abundance ratio diagrams unveiled
by the metal-poor halo stars. Methods. We computed inhomogeneous chemical evolution models for
the Galactic halo assuming different scenarios for the r-process site: the electron-capture supernovae
(EC) and the magnetorotationally driven (MRD) supernovae scenario. We also considered models
with and without the contribution of fast-rotating massive stars (spinstars) to an early enrichment
by the s-process. A detailed comparison with the now large sample of stars with measured abundances
of Sr, Ba, Y, Eu, and Fe is provided (both in terms of scatter plots and number distributions for several
abundance ratios). Results. The scatter observed in these abundance ratios of the very metal-poor
stars (with [Fe/H] < -2.5) can be explained by combining the s-process production in spinstars,
and the r-process contribution coming from massive stars. For the r-process we have developed models
for both the EC and the MRD scenario that match the observations. Conclusions. With the present observational
and theoretical constraints we cannot distinguish between the EC and the MRD scenario in the Galactic
halo. Independently of the r-process scenarios adopted, the production of elements by an s-process
in spinstars is needed to reproduce the spread in abundances of the light neutron capture elements
(Sr and Y) over heavy neutron capture elements (Ba and Eu). We provide a way to test our suggestions
by means of the distribution of the Ba isotopic ratios in a [Ba/Fe] or [Sr/Ba] vs. [Fe/H] diagram.
