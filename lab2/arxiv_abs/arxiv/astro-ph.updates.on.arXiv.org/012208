The next generation of ground-based CMB experiments aim to measure temperature and polarization
fluctuations up to $\ell_{\rm max} \approx 5000$ over half of the sky. Combined with Planck data
on large scales, this will provide improved constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity. However,
the impressive resolution of these experiments will come at a price. Besides signal confusion from
galactic foregrounds, extra-galactic foregrounds and late-time gravitational effects, gravitational
lensing will introduce large non-Gaussianity that can become the leading contribution to the bispectrum
covariance through the connected 4-point function. Here, we compute this effect analytically
for the first time on the full sky for both temperature and polarization. We compare our analytical
results with those obtained directly from map-based simulations of the CMB sky for several levels
of instrumental noise. Of the standard shapes considered in the literature, the local shape is most
affected, resulting in a 35\% increase of the estimator standard deviation for an experiment like
the Simons Observatory (SO) and a 110\% increase for a cosmic-variance limited experiment, including
both temperature and polarization modes up to $\ell_{\rm max} = 3800$. Because of the nature of the
lensing 4-point function, the impact on other shapes is reduced while still non negligible for the
orthogonal shape. Two possible avenues to reduce the non-Gaussian contribution to the covariance
are proposed. First by marginalizing over lensing contributions, such as the ISW-lensing 3pt function
in temperature, and second by delensing the CMB. We show the latter method can remove almost all extra
covariance, reducing the effect to below $<$5\% for local bispectra. At the same time, delensing
would remove signal biases from secondaries induced by lensing, such as ISW-lensing.
