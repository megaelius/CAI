We present twelve new transit light curves of the hot-Jupiter TrES-3b observed during $2012-2018$
to probe the transit timing variation (TTV). By combining the mid-transit times determined from
these twelve transit data with those re-estimated through uniform procedure from seventy one transit
data available in the literature, we derive new linear ephemeris and obtain the timing residuals
that suggest the possibility of TTV in TrES-3 system. However, the frequency analysis shows that
the possible TTV is unlikely to be periodic, indicating the absence of an additional body in this
system. To explore the other possible origins of TTV, the orbital decay and apsidal precession ephemeris
models are fitted to the transit time data. We find decay rate of TrES-3b to be $\bf \dot{P_q}= -4.1
\pm 3.1$ $ms$ ${yr}^{-1}$ and the corresponding estimated modified tidal quality factor of ${Q}^{'}_{\ast}$
$\sim 1.11 \times {10}^{5}$ is consistent with the theoretically predicted values for the stars
hosting the hot-Jupiters. The shift in the transit arrival time of TrES-3b after eleven years is
expected to be ${T}_{shift}\sim 69.55 \ s$, which is consistent with the $RMS$ of the timing residuals.
Besides, we find that the apsidal precession ephemeris model is statistically less probable than
the other considered ephemeris models. It is also discussed that despite the linear ephemeris model
appears to be the most plausible model to represent the transit time data, the possibility of the
orbital decay cannot be completely ruled out in TrES-3 system. In order to confirm this, further
high-precision and high-cadence follow-up observation of transits of TrES-3b would be important.
