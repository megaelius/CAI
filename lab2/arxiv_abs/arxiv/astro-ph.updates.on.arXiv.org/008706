Mechanisms regulating the escape of Ly$\alpha$ photons and ionizing radiation remain poorly understood.
To study these processes we analyze VLA 21cm observations of one Green Pea (GP), J160810+352809
(hereafter J1608), and HST COS spectra of 17 GP galaxies at $z<0.2$. All are highly ionized: J1608
has the highest [O III] $\lambda5007$/[O II] $\lambda3727$ for star-forming galaxies in SDSS,
and the 17 GPs have [O III]/[O II] $\geq6.6$. We set an upper limit on J1608's HI mass of $\log M_{HI}/M_\odot=8.4$,
near or below average compared to similar mass dwarf galaxies. In the COS sample, eight GPs show Ly$\alpha$
absorption components, six of which also have Ly$\alpha$ emission. The HI column densities derived
from Ly$\alpha$ absorption are high, $\log N_{HI}/$cm$^{-2}=19-21$, well above the LyC optically
thick limit. Using low-ionization absorption lines, we measure covering fractions ($f_{\mbox{cov}}$)
of $0.1-1$, and find that $f_{\mbox{cov}}$ strongly anti-correlates with Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction.
Low covering fractions may facilitate Ly$\alpha$ and LyC escape through dense neutral regions.
GPs with $f_{\mbox{cov}}\sim1$ all have low neutral gas velocities, while GPs with lower $f_{\mbox{cov}}=0.2-0.6$
have a larger range of velocities. Conventional mechanical feedback may help establish low $f_{\mbox{cov}}$
in some cases, whereas other processes may be important for GPs with low velocities. Finally, we
compare $f_{\mbox{cov}}$ with proposed indicators of LyC escape. Ionizing photon escape likely
depends on a combination of neutral gas geometry and kinematics, complicating the use of emission-line
diagnostics for identifying LyC emitters.
