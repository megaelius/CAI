Matching the number counts and redshift distribution of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) without
invoking modifications to the initial mass function (IMF) has proved challenging for semi-analytic
models (SAMs) of galaxy formation. We adopt a previously developed SAM that is constrained to match
the z=0 galaxy stellar mass function and makes various predictions that agree well with observational
constraints; we do not recalibrate the SAM for this work. We implement three prescriptions to predict
the submillimeter flux densities of the model galaxies; two depend solely on star formation rate,
whereas the other also depends on the dust mass. By comparing the predictions of the models, we find
that taking into account the dust mass, which affects the dust temperature and thus influences the
far-infrared spectral energy distribution, is crucial for matching the number counts and redshift
distribution of SMGs. Moreover, despite using a standard IMF, our model can match the observed SMG
number counts and redshift distribution reasonably well, which contradicts the conclusions of
some previous studies that a top-heavy IMF, in addition to taking into account the effect of dust
mass, is needed to match these observations. Although we have not identified the key ingredient
that is responsible for our model matching the observed SMG number counts and redshift distribution
without IMF variation- which is challenging given the different prescriptions for physical processes
employed in the SAMs of interest-our results demonstrate that in SAMs, IMF variation is degenerate
with other physical processes, such as stellar feedback.
