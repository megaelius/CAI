The astrophysical origin of gravitational wave (GW) events discovered by LIGO/VIRGO remains an
outstanding puzzle. In active galactic nuclei (AGN), compact-object binaries form, evolve, and
interact with a dense star cluster and a gas disk. While most binaries are soft and get disrupted by
binary-single interactions, an important question is whether and how binaries can merge in these
environments. To address this question, we have performed one-dimensional $N$-body simulations
combined with a semi-analytical model which includes the formation, disruption, and evolution
of binaries self-consistently. We point out that binaries can form in single-single interactions
by the dissipation of kinetic energy in a gaseous medium. This "gas capture" binary formation channel
contributes up to $97\,\%$ of gas-driven mergers and leads to a high merger rate in AGN disks even
without pre-existing binaries. We find the merger rate to be in the range $\sim 0.02-60\,\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$,
whose high end corresponds to top heavy initial mass functions, highly anisotropic initial BH distribution,
short AGN lifetime, and large AGN disk sizes. The results are insensitive to the assumptions on gaseous
hardening processes: we find that once they are formed, binaries merge efficiently via binary-single
interactions even if these gaseous processes are neglected. We find that the average number of mergers
per BH is $0.4$, and the probability for repeated mergers in 30 Myr is $\sim 0.21-0.45$. High BH masses
due to repeated mergers, high eccentricities, and a significant Doppler drift of GWs are promising
signatures which distinguish this merger channel from others. Furthermore, we find that gas-capture
binaries reproduce the distribution of LMXBs in the Galactic center, including an outer cutoff
at $\sim1$ pc due to the competition between migration and hardening by gas torques.
