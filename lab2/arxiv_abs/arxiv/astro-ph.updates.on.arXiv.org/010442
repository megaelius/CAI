In the era of large high-resolution spectroscopic surveys, high-quality spectra can contribute
to our understanding of the Galactic chemical evolution, providing chemical abundances belonging
to the different nucleosynthesis channels, and also providing constraints to stellar age. Some
abundance ratios have been proven to be excellent indicators of stellar ages. We aim at providing
an empirical relationship between stellar ages and [C/N] using, as calibrators, open star clusters
observed by both the Gaia-ESO and APOGEE surveys. We use stellar parameters and abundances from
the Gaia-ESO and APOGEE of the Galactic field and open cluster stars. Ages of star clusters are retrieved
from the literature sources and validated using a common set of isochrones. We use the same isochrones
to determine, for each age and metallicity, the surface gravity at which the first dredge-up and
red giant branch bump occur. We study the effect of extra-mixing processes in our sample of giant
stars, and we derive the mean [C/N] in evolved stars, including only stars without evidence of extra-mixing.
Combining the Gaia-ESO and APOGEE samples of open clusters, we derive a linear relationship between
[C/N] and logarithmic cluster ages. We apply our relationship to selected giant field stars in both
Gaia-ESO and APOGEE. We find an age separation between thin and thick disc stars and age trends within
their populations, with an increasing age towards lower metallicity populations. With such empirical
relationship, we are able to provide an age estimate for giant stars in which C and N abundances are
measured. Isochrone fitting is less sensitive for giant than dwarf stars at the turn off. The present
method can be thus considered as an additional tool to give an independent estimate of the age of giant
stars, with uncertainties in their ages comparable to those obtained using isochrone fitting for
dwarf stars.
