The manifestation of the dark Universe begun with unexpected large scale astronomical observations.
Here we are investigating the origin of small scale anomalies, like that of the annually observed
temperature anomalies in the stratosphere. Unexpectedly, we observe a planetary relationship
of the daily stratospheric temperature distribution. Its spectral shape does not match concurrent
solar activity, or solar EUV emission, whose impact on the atmosphere is unequivocal. This behavior
points at an additional energy source of exosolar origin. A viable concept behind such observations
is based on possible gravitational focusing by the solar system towards the Earth of low speed invisible
matter. We denote generic constituents from the dark Universe as invisible matter, in order to distinguish
them from ordinary dark matter candidates like axions or WIMPs, which cannot have any noticeable
impact on the stratosphere. The observed peaking planetary relations exclude on their own any conventional
explanation. Only a somehow strongly interacting invisible streaming matter with the little screened
upper stratosphere (noverhead about 1 gr/cm 2) can be behind the occasionally observed temperature
increases. We also estimate an associated energy deposition O(W/m 2), which is variable over the
11 years solar cycle. For the widely assumed picture of a quasi not interacting dark Universe, this
new exosolar energy is enormous. Since the atmosphere is uninterruptedly monitored since decades,
it can serve also parasitically as a novel low threshold detector for the dark Universe, with built-in
spatiotemporal resolution and the solar system acting temporally as signal amplifier. In future,
analyzing more observations, for example, from the anomalous ionosphere, or, the transient sudden
stratospheric warmings, the nature of the assumed invisible streams could be deciphered.
