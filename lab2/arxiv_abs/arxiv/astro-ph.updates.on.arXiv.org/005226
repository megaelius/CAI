We present 3D global kinetic pulsar magnetosphere models, where the charged particle trajectories
and the corresponding electromagnetic fields are treated self-consistently. For our study, we
have developed a cartesian 3D relativistic particle-in-cell code that incorporates the radiation
reaction forces. We describe our code and discuss the related technical issues, treatments, and
assumptions. Injecting particles up to large distances in the magnetosphere, we apply arbitrarily
low to high particle injection rates and get an entire spectrum of solutions from close to the Vacuum-Retarded-Dipole
to close to the Force-Free solution, respectively. For high particle injection rates (close to
FF solutions) significant accelerating electric field components are confined only near the equatorial
current sheet outside the light-cylinder. A judicious interpretation of our models allows the
calculation of the particle emission and consequently the derivation of the corresponding realistic
high-energy sky-maps and spectra. Using model parameters that cover the entire range of spin-down
powers of Fermi young and millisecond pulsars, we compare the corresponding model $\gamma$-ray
light-curves, cutoff energies, and total $\gamma$-ray luminosities with those observed by Fermi
to discover a dependence of the particle injection-rate, $\mathcal{F}$, on the spin-down power,
$\dot{\mathcal{E}}$, indicating an increase of $\mathcal{F}$ with $\dot{\mathcal{E}}$. Our
models guided by Fermi observations provide field-structures and particle distributions that
are not only consistent with each other but also able to reproduce a broad range of the observed $\gamma$-ray
phenomenology of both young and millisecond pulsars.
