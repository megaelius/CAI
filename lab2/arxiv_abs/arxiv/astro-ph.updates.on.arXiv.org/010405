We perform an extensive analysis of optical counterparts of Planck PSZ2 clusters, considering
matches with three recent catalogs built from SDSS data: AMF DR9, redMaPPer (v6.3) and Wen et al (WHL).
We significantly extend the number of optical counterparts of detected Planck clusters, and characterize
the optical properties when multiple identifications in different catalogs exist. For Planck
clusters which already possess an external validation, we analyze the redshift assignment for
both optical and X--ray determinations. We then analyze the Planck Cosmology sample and comment
on redshift determination and potential mass mis-determinations due to alignment issues. Finally,
we inspect the reconstructed $y$ map from Planck and reason on the detectability of optical clusters.
Overall, AMF DR9 main (extended) finds 485 (511) optical matches, with 45 (55) previously unmatched
PSZ2 clusters, to be compared with the 374 optical matches already present in PSZ2. 29 of the 55 previously
unmatched clusters do not yet have a followup in the literature. 18 of these are found in more than
one SDSS catalog with consistent redshifts. We provide redshift and mass estimates for the newly
matched clusters, and discuss the comparison with the follow-ups, when present. We find good agreement
between the redMaPPer and AMF DR9 redshift determinations. From the Planck Cosmology sample, we
find 14 clusters which merit further investigation, and discuss possible alignment issues for
9 of these clusters. After inspecting the $y$ map, we provide a list of 229 optical clusters not included
in the Planck PSZ2 catalog but showing a prominent $y$ signal. We have further investigated the 86
clusters with Planck S/N $>4.5$ using the MMF technique (applied to the Planck HFI maps), and were
able to detect 20 new cluster candidates that are not included in the PSZ2 catalog.
