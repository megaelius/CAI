There are several issues to do with dwarf galaxy predictions in the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology
that have suscitated much recent debate about the possible modification of the nature of dark matter
as providing a solution. We explore a novel solution involving ultra-light axions that can potentially
resolve the missing satellites problem, the cusp-core problem, and the `too big to fail' problem.
We discuss approximations to non-linear structure formation in dark matter models containing
a component of ultra-light axions across four orders of magnitude in mass, $10^{-24}\text{ eV}\lesssim
m_a \lesssim 10^{-20}\text{ eV}$, a range too heavy to be well constrained by linear cosmological
probes such as the CMB and matter power spectrum, and too light/non-interacting for other astrophysical
or terrestrial axion searches. We find that an axion of mass $m_a\approx 10^{-21}\text{ eV}$ contributing
approximately $85\%$ of the total dark matter can introduce a significant kpc scale core in a typical
Milky Way satellite galaxy in sharp contrast to a thermal relic with a transfer function cut off at
the same scale, while still allowing such galaxies to form in significant number. Therefore ultra-light
axions do not suffer from the \emph{Catch 22} that applies to using a warm dark matter as a solution
to the small scale problems of cold dark matter. Our model simultaneously allows formation of enough
high redshift galaxies to allow reconciliation with observational constraints, and also reduces
the maximum circular velocities of massive dwarfs so that baryonic feedback may more plausibly
resolve the predicted overproduction of massive MWG dwarf satellites.
