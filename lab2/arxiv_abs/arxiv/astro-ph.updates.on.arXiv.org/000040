We consider the effects of different star formation criteria on galactic scales, in high-resolution
simulations with explicitly resolved GMCs and stellar feedback. We compare: (1) a self-gravity
criterion (based on the local virial parameter and the assumption that self-gravitating gas collapses
to high density in a free-fall time), (2) a fixed density threshold, (3) a molecular-gas law, (4)
a temperature threshold, (5) a Jeans-instability requirement, (6) a criteria that cooling times
be shorter than dynamical times, and (7) a convergent-flow criterion. We consider these both MW-like
and high-density (starburst) galaxies. With feedback present, all models produce identical integrated
star formation rates (SFRs), in agreement with the Kennicutt relation. Without feedback all produce
orders-of-magnitude excessive SFRs. This is totally dependent on feedback and independent of
the SF law. However, the spatial and density distribution of SF depend strongly on the SF criteria.
Because cooling rates are generally fast and gas is turbulent, criteria (4)-(7) are 'weak' and spread
SF uniformly over the disk (above densities n~0.01-0.1 cm^-3). A molecular criterion (3) localizes
to higher densities, but still a wide range; for metallicity near solar, it is similar to a density
threshold at n~1 cm^-3 (well below mean densities in the MW center or starbursts). Fixed density
thresholds (2) can always select the highest densities, but must be adjusted for simulation resolution
and galaxy properties; the same threshold that works in a MW-like simulation will select nearly
all gas in a starburst. Binding criteria (1) tend to adaptively select the largest over-densities,
independent of galaxy model or resolution, and automatically predict clustered SF. We argue that
this SF model is most physically-motivated and presents significant numerical advantages in large-dynamic
range simulations.
