We present the first temperature surface map of EK Dra from very-high-resolution spectra obtained
with the Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI) at the Large Binocular
Telescope. Changes in spectral line profiles are inverted to a stellar surface temperature map
using our $i$Map code. The long-term photometric record is employed to compare our map with previously
published maps. Four cool spots were reconstructed, but no polar spot was seen. The temperature
difference to the photosphere of the spots is between 990 and 280K. Two spots are reconstructed with
a typical solar morphology with an umbra and a penumbra. For the one isolated and relatively round
spot (A), we determine an umbral temperature of 990K and a penumbral temperature of 180K below photospheric
temperature. The umbra to photosphere intensity ratio of EK Dra is approximately only half of that
of a comparison sunspot. A test inversion from degraded line profiles showed that the higher spectral
resolution of PEPSI reconstructs the surface with a temperature difference that is on average 10%
higher than before and with smaller surface areas by 10-20%. PEPSI is therefore better suited to
detecting and characterising temperature inhomogeneities. With ten more years of photometry,
we also refine the spot cycle period of EK Dra to 8.9$\pm$0.2 years with a continuing long-term fading
trend. The temperature morphology of spot A so far appears to show the best evidence for the existence
of a solar-like penumbra for a starspot. We emphasise that it is more the non-capture of the true umbral
contrast rather than the detection of the weak penumbra that is the limiting factor. The relatively
small line broadening of EK Dra, together with the only moderately high spectral resolutions previously
available, appear to be the main contributors to the lower-than-expected spot contrasts when comparing
to the Sun.
