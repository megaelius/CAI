The presence of g- and p-modes allows testing stellar models from the core to the envelope. Moreover,
binarity in an eclipsing system constrains the physical parameters of the pulsating star. CoRot
ID 100866999 is a relatively large-amplitude hybrid gDor - dSct star with two clearly distinct frequency
domains. The large number of detected frequencies allows a detailed study of the interaction between
them. In addition, we can derive the fundamental parameters of both components from the study of
the eclipsing light curve. After removing the eclipsing phases, we analyzed the data with the Period04
package up to S/N=4. The light curve was then prewhitened with these oscillation frequencies to
derive the fundamental parameters of the two components. The eclipsing light curve analysis results
in a (1.8+1.1)\,Mo system, both components being main sequence stars. We detect 124 frequencies
related to luminosity variations of the primary. They are present in two well-separated domains:
89 frequencies in the interval [0.30;3.64]/d and 35 in the interval [14.57; 33.96]/d. There are
22 gDor frequencies separated by a constant period interval Delta P = 0.03493 d. These frequencies
correspond to a series of g-modes of degree ell=1 with successive radial orders k. We identify 21
linear combinations between the first nine gDor frequencies. The dSct domain is dominated by a large-amplitude
frequency F=16.9803 /d. The eight first gDor frequencies f_i are present with much lower amplitude
in the delta Scuti domain as F +/- f_i. These interactions between g- and p-modes confirm the phenomenon
we detected in another CoRoT star. The amplitude and the phase of the main frequency F shows a double-wave
modulation along the orbital phase, giving rise to series of combination frequencies. Such combination
frequencies are also detected, with lower amplitude, for the first gDor modes.
