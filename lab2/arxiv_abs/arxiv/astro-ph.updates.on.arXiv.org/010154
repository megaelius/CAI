In this paper, we characterize the first $\gamma$-ray flaring episode of the FSRQ PKS 0346-27 (z=0.991),
as revealed by Fermi-LAT monitoring data, and the concurrent multi-wavelength variability observed
from radio through X-rays. The quasi-simultaneous multi-wavelength coverage allowed us to construct
time-resolved spectral energy distributions (SEDs). PKS 0346-27 entered an elevated $\gamma$-ray
activity state starting from the beginning of 2018. The high-state continued throughout the year,
displaying the highest fluxes in May 2018. We find evidence of short-time scale variability down
to $\sim$1.5 hours, which constrains the $\gamma$-ray emission region to be compact. The extended
flaring period was characterized by a persistently harder spectrum with respect to the quiescent
state, indicating changes in the broadband spectral properties of the source. This was confirmed
by the multi-wavelength observations, which show a shift in the position of the two SED peaks by $\sim$2
orders of magnitude in energy and peak flux value. As a result, during the high state the non-thermal
jet emission completely outshines the thermal contribution from the dust torus and accretion disk.
The broadband SED of PKS 0346-27 transitions from a typical Low-Synchrotron-Peaked (LSP) to the
Intermediate-Synchrotron-Peaked (ISP) class, a behavior previously observed in other flaring
$\gamma$-ray sources. Our one-zone leptonic emission model of the high-state SEDs constrains
the $\gamma$-ray emission region to have a lower magnetic field, larger radius, and higher maximum
electron Lorentz factors with respect to the quiescent SED. Finally, we note that the bright and
hard $\gamma$-ray spectrum observed during the peak of flaring activity in May 2018 implies that
PKS 0346-27 could be a promising target for future ground-based Cherenkov observatories such as
the CTA.
