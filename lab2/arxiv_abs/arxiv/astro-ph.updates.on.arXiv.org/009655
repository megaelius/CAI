As part of the Swift/UVOT Stars Survey, we present near-ultraviolet point-source photometry for
103 Galactic open clusters. These data, taken over the span of the mission, provide a unique and unprecedented
set of near-ultraviolet point-source photometry on simple stellar populations. After applying
membership analysis fueled mostly by GAIA DR2 proper motions, we find that 49 of these 103 have clear
precise CMDs amenable to investigation. We compare the CMDs to theoretical isochrones and find
good agreement between the theoretical isochrones and the CMDs. The exceptions are the fainter
parts of the main sequence and the red giant branch in the uvw2-uvw1 CMDs, which is most likely due
either to the difficulty of correcting for the red leak in the uvw2 filter or limitations in our understanding
of UV opacities for cool stars. For the most part, our derived cluster parameters -- age, distance
and reddening -- agree with the consensus literature but we find a few clusters that warrant substantial
revision from literature values, notably NGC~2304, NGC~2343, NGC~2360, NGC~2396, NGC~2428,
NGC~2509, NGC~2533, NGC~2571, NGC~2818, Collinder~220 and NGC~6939. A number of clusters also
show white dwarf and blue straggler sequences. We confirm the presence of extended main sequence
turnoffs in NGC~2360 and NGC~2818 and show hints of it in a number of other clusters which may warrant
future spectroscopic study. Most of the clusters in the study have low extinction and the rest are
well fit by a "Milky-Way-like" extinction law. However, Collinder~220 hints at a possible "LMC-like"
extinction law. We finally provide a comprehensive point-source catalog to the community as a tool
for future investigation.
