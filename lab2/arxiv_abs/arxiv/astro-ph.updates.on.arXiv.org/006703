Context. We investigate small-amplitude light variations in FU Ori occurring in timescales of
days and weeks. Aims. We seek to determine the mechanisms that lead to these light changes. Methods.
The visual light curve of FU Ori gathered by the MOST satellite continuously for 55 days in the 2013-2014
winter season and simultaneously obtained ground-based multi-colour data were compared with
the results from a disc and star light synthesis model. Results. Hotspots on the star are not responsible
for the majority of observed light variations. Instead, we found that the long periodic family of
10.5-11.4 d (presumably) quasi-periods showing light variations up to 0.07 mag may arise owing
to the rotational revolution of disc inhomogeneities located between 16-20 solar radii. The same
distance is obtained by assuming that these light variations arise because of a purely Keplerian
revolution of these inhomogeneities for a stellar mass of 0.7 solar mass. The short-periodic (3-1.38
d) small amplitude (0.01 mag) light variations show a clear sign of period shortening, similar to
what was discovered in the first MOST observations of FU Ori. Our data indicate that these short-periodic
oscillations may arise because of changing visibility of plasma tongues (not included in our model),
revolving in the magnetospheric gap and/or likely related hotspots as well. Conclusions. Results
obtained for the long-periodic 10-11 d family of light variations appear to be roughly in line with
the colour-period relation, which assumes that longer periods are produced by more external and
cooler parts of the disc. Coordinated observations in a broad spectral range are still necessary
to fully understand the nature of the short-periodic 1-3 d family of light variations and their period
changes.
