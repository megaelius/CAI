The masses of stellar-remnant black holes (BH), as a result of their formation via massive single-
and binary-stellar evolution, is of high interest in this era of gravitational-wave detection
from binary black hole (BBH) and binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. Here we present new developments
in the N-body evolution program NBODY7 in regards to its stellar-remnant formation and related
schemes. We demonstrate that the newly-implemented stellar-wind and remnant-formation schemes
in the NBODY7 code's BSE sector, such as the 'rapid' and the 'delayed' supernova (SN) schemes along
with an implementation of pulsational-pair-instability and pair-instability supernova (PPSN/PSN),
now produces neutron star (NS) and BH masses that agree nearly perfectly, over large ranges of zero-age-main
sequence (ZAMS) mass and metallicity, with those from the StarTrack population-synthesis program.
We also demonstrate the new implementations of various natal-kick mechanisms on NSs and BHs such
as the 'convection-asymmetry-driven', 'collapse-asymmetry-driven', and 'neutrino-emission-driven'
kicks, in addition to a fully consistent implementation of the standard, fallback-dependent,
momentum-conserving natal kick. We find that the SN material fallback causes the convection-asymmetry
kick to effectively retain similar number and mass of BHs in clusters as for the standard, momentum-conserving
kick. The collapse-asymmetry kick would cause nearly all BHs to retain in clusters irrespective
of remnant formation model and metallicity, whereas the inference of a large number of BHs in GCs
would potentially rule out the neutrino-driven kick mechanism. Pre-SN mergers of massive primordial
binaries would potentially cause BH masses to deviate from the theoretical, single-star ZAMS mass-remnant
mass relation unless a substantial, up to 40%, of the total merging stellar mass is lost during a merger
process. [Abridged]
