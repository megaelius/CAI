We use the sky-average spectrum measured by EDGES High-Band ($90-190$ MHz) to constrain parameters
of early galaxies independent of the absorption feature at $78$~MHz reported by Bowman et al. (2018).
These parameters represent traditional models of cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionization produced
with the 21cmFAST simulation code (Mesinger & Furlanetto 2007, Mesinger et al. 2011). The parameters
considered are: (1) the UV ionizing efficiency ($\zeta$), (2) minimum halo virial temperature
hosting efficient star-forming galaxies ($T^{\rm min}_{\rm vir}$), (3) integrated soft-band
X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm X\,<\,2\,keV}/{\rm SFR}$), and (4) minimum X-ray energy escaping the
first galaxies ($E_{0}$), corresponding to a typical H${\rm \scriptstyle I}$ column density for
attenuation through the interstellar medium. The High-Band spectrum disfavors high values of
$T^{\rm min}_{\rm vir}$ and $\zeta$, which correspond to signals with late absorption troughs
and sharp reionization transitions. It also disfavors intermediate values of $L_{\rm X\,<\,2\,keV}/{\rm
SFR}$, which produce relatively deep and narrow troughs within the band. Specifically, we rule
out $39.4<\log_{10}\left(L_{\rm X\,<\,2\,keV}/{\rm SFR}\right)<39.8$ ($95\%$ C.L.). We then
combine the EDGES High-Band data with constraints on the electron scattering optical depth from
Planck and the hydrogen neutral fraction from high-$z$ quasars. This produces a lower degeneracy
between $\zeta$ and $T^{\rm min}_{\rm vir}$ than that reported in Greig & Mesinger (2017a) using
the Planck and quasar constraints alone. Our main result in this combined analysis is the estimate
$4.5$~$\leq \log_{10}\left(T^{\rm min}_{\rm vir}/\rm K\right)\leq$~$5.7$ ($95\%$ C.L.).
We leave for future work the evaluation of $21$~cm models using simultaneously data from EDGES Low-
and High-Band.
