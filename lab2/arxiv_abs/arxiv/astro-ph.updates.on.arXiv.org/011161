According to the Snowball Earth hypothesis, Earth has experienced periods of low-latitude glaciation
in its deep past. Prior studies have used general circulation models (GCMs) to examine the effects
such an extreme climate state might have on the structure and dynamics of Earth's troposphere, but
the behavior of the stratosphere has not been studied in detail. Understanding the snowball stratosphere
is important for developing an accurate account of the Earth's radiative and chemical properties
during these episodes. Here we conduct the first analysis of the stratospheric circulation of the
Snowball Earth using ECHAM6 general circulation model simulations. In order to understand the
factors contributing to the stratospheric circulation, we extend the Statistical Transformed
Eulerian Mean framework. We find that the stratosphere during a snowball with prescribed modern
ozone levels exhibits a weaker meridional overturning circulation, reduced wave activity, stronger
zonal jets, and is extremely cold relative to modern conditions. Notably, the snowball stratosphere
displays no sudden stratospheric warmings. Without ozone, the stratosphere displays slightly
weaker circulation, a complete lack of polar vortex, and even colder temperatures. We also explicitly
quantify for the first time the cross-tropopause mass exchange rate and stratospheric mixing efficiency
during the snowball and show that our values do not change the constraints on CO$_2$ inferred from
geochemical proxies during the Marinoan glaciation ($\sim$635 Ma), unless the O$_2$ concentration
during the snowball was orders of magnitude less than the CO$_2$ concentration.
