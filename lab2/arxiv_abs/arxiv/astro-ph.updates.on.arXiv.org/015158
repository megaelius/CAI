We present new isochrone fits to colour-magnitude diagrams of the Galactic globular cluster NGC\,6205
(M13). We utilise 34 photometric bands from the ultraviolet to mid-infrared by use of data from the
{\it HST}, {\it Gaia} DR2, SDSS, unWISE, Pan-STARRS DR1, and other photometric sources. In our isochrone
fitting we use the PARSEC, MIST, DSEP, BaSTI, and IAC-BaSTI theoretical models and isochrones,
both for the solar-scaled and He-$\alpha$-enhanced abundances, with a metallicity of about [Fe/H]$=-1.58$
adopted from the literature. The colour-magnitude diagrams, obtained with pairs of filters from
different datasets but of similar effective wavelengths, show some colour offsets up to 0.04 mag
between the fiducial sequences and isochrones. We attribute these offsets to systematic differences
of the datasets. Some intrinsic systematic differences of the models/isochrones remain in our
results: the derived distances and ages are different for the ultraviolet, optical and infrared
photometry used, while the derived ages are different for the different models/isochrones, e.g.
in the optical range from $12.3\pm0.7$ Gyr for He-$\alpha$-enhanced DSEP to $14.4\pm0.7$ Gyr for
MIST. Despite the presence of multiple stellar populations, we obtain convergent estimates for
the dominant population: best-fitting distance $7.4\pm0.2$ kpc, true distance modulus $14.35\pm0.06$
mag, parallax $0.135\pm0.004$ mas, extinction $A_\mathrm{V}=0.12\pm0.02$, and reddening $E(B-V)=0.04\pm0.01$.
These estimates agree with other recent estimates, however, the extinction and reddening are twice
as high as generally accepted. The derived empirical extinction law agrees with the Cardelli-Clayton-Mathis
extinction law with the best-fitting $R_\mathrm{V}=3.1^{+1.6}_{-1.1}$.
