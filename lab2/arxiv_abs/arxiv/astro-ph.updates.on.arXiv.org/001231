The close binary system NN Serpentis must have gone through a common envelope phase before the formation
of its white dwarf. During this phase, a substantial amount of mass was lost from the envelope. The
recently detected orbits of circumbinary planets were suggested to be inconsistent with planet
formation before the mass loss. We explore whether new planets may have formed from the ejecta of
the common envelope, and derive the expected planetary mass as a function of radius. We employ the
model of \citet{Kashi11} to estimate the amount of mass that is retained during the ejection event,
and infer the properties of the resulting disk from the conservation of mass and angular momentum.
The resulting planetary masses are estimated from models with and without radiative feedback.
We show that the observed planetary masses can be reproduced for appropriate model parameters.
Photoheating can stabilize the disks in the interior, potentially explaining the observed planetary
orbits on scales of a few AU. We compare the expected mass scale of planets for 11 additional systems
with observational results and find hints for two populations, one consistent with planet formation
from the ejecta of common envelopes, and a separate population that may have formed earlier. The
formation of the observed planets from the ejecta of common envelopes seems feasible. The model
proposed here can be tested through refined observations of additional post-common envelope systems.
While it appears observationally challenging to distinguish between the accretion on pre-existing
planets and their growth from new fragments, it may be possible to further constrain the properties
of the protoplanetary disk through additional observations of current planetary candidates and
post-common envelope binary systems.
