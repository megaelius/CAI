Quenching of star-formation has been identified in many starburst and post-starburst galaxies,
indicating burst-like star-formation histories (SFH) in the primordial Universe. We have investigated
the role of high energy cosmic rays (CRs) in such environments, particularly how they could contribute
to this burst-like SFH via quenching and feedback. These high energy particles interact with the
baryon and radiation fields of their host via hadronic processes to produce secondary leptons.
The secondary particles then also interact with ambient radiation fields to generate X-rays through
inverse-Compton scattering. In addition, they can thermalise directly with the semi-ionised
medium via Coulomb processes. Heating at a rate of $\sim 10^{-25} \; \text{erg}~\text{cm}^{-3}~\text{s}^{-1}$
can be attained by Coulomb processes in a star-forming galaxy with one core-collapse SN event per
decade, and this is sufficient to cause quenching of star-formation. At high-redshift, a substantial
amount of CR secondary electron energy can be diverted into inverse-Compton X-ray emission. This
yields an X-ray luminosity of above $10^{41}~\text{erg}~\text{s}^{-1}$ by redshift $z=7$ which
drives a further heating effect, operating over larger scales. This would be able to halt inflowing
cold gas filaments, strangulating subsequent star-formation. We selected a sample of 16 starburst
and post-starburst galaxies at $7\lesssim z \lesssim 9$ and determine the star-formation rates
they could have sustained. We applied a model with CR injection, propagation and heating to calculate
energy deposition rates in these 16 sources. Our calculations show that CR feedback cannot be neglected
as it has the strength to suppress star-formation in these systems. We also show that their currently
observed quiescence is consistent with the suffocation of cold inflows, probably by a combination
of X-ray and CR heating.
