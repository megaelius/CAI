YY Gem is a short-period eclipsing binary system containing two nearly identical, rapidly rotating,
very active early-M dwarfs. This binary represents an important benchmark system for calibrating
empirical relations between fundamental properties of low-mass stars and for testing theories
of interior structure and evolution of these objects. Both components of YY Gem exhibit inflated
radii, which has been attributed to poorly understood magnetic activity effects. Despite a long
history of magnetic activity studies of this system no direct magnetic field measurements have
been made for it. Here we present a comprehensive characterisation of the surface magnetic field
in both components of YY Gem. We reconstructed the global field topologies with the help of a tomographic
inversion technique applied to high-resolution spectropolarimetric data. This analysis revealed
moderately complex global fields with a typical strength of 200-300 G and anti-aligned dipolar
components. A complementary Zeeman intensification analysis of the disentangled intensity spectra
showed that the total mean field strength reaches 3.2-3.4 kG in both components of YY Gem. We used
these results together with other recent magnetic field measurements of M dwarfs to investigate
the relation between the global and small-scale fields in these stars. We also assessed predictions
of competing magnetoconvection interior structure models developed for YY Gem, finding that only
one of them anticipated the surface field strength compatible with our observations. Results of
our star spot mapping of YY Gem do not support the alternative family of theoretical stellar models
which attempts to explain the radii inflation by postulating a large spot filling factor.
