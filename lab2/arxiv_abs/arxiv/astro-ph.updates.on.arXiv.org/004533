The Cosmic-Ray Extremely Distributed Observatory (CREDO) is an infrastructure for global analysis
of extremely extended cosmic-ray phenomena, so-called super-preshowers, beyond the capabilities
of existing, discrete, detectors and observatories. To date cosmic-ray research has been focused
on detecting single air showers, while the search for ensembles of cosmic-ray events induced by
super-preshowers is a scientific terra incognita - CREDO explores this uncharted realm. Positive
detection of super-preshowers would have an impact on ultra-high energy astrophysics, cosmology
and the physics of fundamental particle interactions as they can theoretically be formed within
both classical (photon-photon interactions) and exotic (Super Heavy Dark Matter particle decay
and interaction) scenarios. Some super-preshowers are predicted to have a significant spatial
extent - a unique signature only detectable with the existing cosmic-ray infrastructure taken
as a global network. An obvious, although yet unprobed, super-preshower 'detection limit' would
be located somewhere between an air shower, induced by a super-preshower composed of tightly collimated
particles, and a super-preshower composed of particles spread so widely that only few of them can
reach the Earth. CREDO will probe this detection limit, leading to either an observation of an as
yet unseen physical phenomenon, or the setting upper limits to the existence of large extraterrestrial
cascades which would constrain fundamental physics models. While CREDO's focus is on testing physics
at energies close to the Grand Unified Theories range, the broader phenomena are expected to be composed
of particles with energies ranging from GeV to ZeV. This motivates our advertising of this concept
across the astroparticle physics community.
