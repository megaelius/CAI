Penumbral microjets (PMJs) are short-lived, jet-like objects found in the penumbra of sunspots.
They were first discovered in chromospheric lines and have later also been shown to exhibit signals
in transition region (TR) lines. Their origin and manner of evolution is not yet settled. We perform
a comprehensive analysis of PMJs through the use of spectral diagnostics that span from photospheric
to TR temperatures to constrain PMJ properties. We employed high-spatial-resolution Swedish
1-m Solar Telescope observations in the Ca II 8542 Angstrom and H-alpha lines, IRIS slit-jaw images,
and IRIS spectral observations in the Mg II h & k lines, the Mg II 2798.75 Angstrom & 2798.82 Angstrom
triplet blend, the C II 1334 Angstrom & 1335 Angstrom lines, and the Si IV 1394 Angstrom & 1403 Angstrom
lines. We derived a wide range of spectral diagnostics from these and investigated other secondary
phenomena associated with PMJs. We find that PMJs exhibit varying degrees of signal in all of our
studied spectral lines. We find low or negligible Doppler velocities and velocity gradients throughout
our diagnostics and all layers of the solar atmosphere associated with these. Dark features in the
inner wings of H-alpha and Ca II 8542 Angstrom imply that PMJs form along pre-existing fibril structures.
We find evidence for upper photospheric heating in a subset of PMJs through emission in the wings
of the Mg II triplet lines. There is little evidence for ubiquitous twisting motion in PMJs. There
is no marked difference in onset-times for PMJ brightenings in different spectral lines. PMJs most
likely exhibit only very modest mass-motions, contrary to earlier suggestions. We posit that PMJs
form at upper photospheric or chromospheric heights at pre-existing fibril structures.
