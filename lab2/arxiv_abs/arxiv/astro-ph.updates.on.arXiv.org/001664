Measurements of masses and ages of young stars from their location in the HR diagram are limited by
not only the typical observational uncertainties that apply to field stars, but also by large systematic
uncertainties related to circumstellar phenomena. In this paper, we analyze flux calibrated optical
spectra to measure accurate spectral types and extinctions of 283 nearby T Tauri stars. The primary
advances in this paper are (1) the incorporation of a simplistic accretion continuum in optical
spectral type and extinction measurements calculated over the full optical wavelength range and
(2) the uniform analysis of a large sample of stars. Comparisons between the non-accreting TTS photospheric
templates and stellar photosphere models are used to derive conversions from spectral type to temperature.
Differences between spectral types can be subtle and difficult to discern, especially when accounting
for accretion and extinction. The spectral types measured here are mostly consistent with spectral
types measured over the past decade. However, our new spectral types are 1-2 subclasses later than
literature spectral types for the original members of the TWA and are discrepant with literature
values for some well known Taurus CTTSs. Our extinction measurements are consistent with other
optical extinction measurements but are typically 1 mag lower than nIR measurements, likely the
result of methodological differences and the presence of nIR excesses in most CTTSs. As an illustration
of the impact of accretion, SpT, and extinction uncertainties on the HR diagrams of young clusters,
we find that the resulting luminosity spread of stars in the TWA is 15-30%. The luminosity spread
in the TWA and previously measured for binary stars in Taurus suggests that for a majority of stars,
protostellar accretion rates are not large enough to significantly alter the subsequent evolution.
