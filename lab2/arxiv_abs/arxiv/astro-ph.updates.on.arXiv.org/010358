Galaxy interaction is considered a key driver of galaxy evolution and star formation (SF) history.
In this paper, we present an empirical picture of the radial extent of interaction-triggered SF
along the merger sequence. The samples under study are drawn from the integral field spectroscopy
(IFS) survey SDSS-IV MaNGA, including 205 star-forming galaxies in pairs/mergers and ~1350 control
galaxies. For each galaxy in pairs, the merger stage is identified according to its morphological
signatures: incoming phase, at first pericenter passage, at apocenter, in merging phase, and in
final coalescence. The effect of interactions is quantified by the global and spatially resolved
SF rate relative to the SF rate of a control sample selected for each individual galaxy ($\Delta$logSFR
and $\Delta$logsSFR(r), respectively). Analysis of the radial $\Delta$logsSFR(r) distributions
shows that galaxy interactions have no significant impact on the $\Delta$logsSFR(r) during the
incoming phase. Right after the first pericenter passage, the radial $\Delta$logsSFR(r) profile
decreases steeply from enhanced to suppressed activity for increasing galactocentric radius.
Later on, SF is enhanced on a broad spatial scale out to the maximum radius we explore (~6.7 kpc) and
the enhancement is in general centrally peaked. The extended SF enhancement is also observed for
systems at their apocenters and in the coalescence phase, suggesting that interaction-triggered
SF is not restricted to the central region of a galaxy. Further explorations of a wide range in parameter
space of merger configurations (e.g., mass ratio) are required to constrain the whole picture of
interaction-triggered SF.
