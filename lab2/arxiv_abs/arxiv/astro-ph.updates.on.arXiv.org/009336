It has been proposed that Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) at sub-millimeter waves will
allow us to image the shadow of the black hole in the center of our Milky Way, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*),
and thereby test basic predictions of general relativity. This paper presents imaging simulations
of a new Space VLBI mission concept. An initial design study of the concept has been presented as the
Event Horizon Imager (EHI). The EHI may be suitable for imaging Sgr A* at high frequencies (up to ~690
GHz), which has significant advantages over performing ground-based VLBI at 230 GHz. The concept
EHI design consists of two or three satellites in polar or equatorial circular Medium-Earth Orbits
with slightly different radii. Due to the relative drift of the satellites along the individual
orbits, this setup will result in a dense spiral-shaped uv-coverage with long baselines (up to ~60
Glambda), allowing for extremely high-resolution and high-fidelity imaging of radio sources.
We simulate EHI observations of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics models of Sgr A* and
calculate the expected noise based on preliminary system parameters. On long baselines, where
the signal-to-noise ratio may be low, fringes could be detected if the system is sufficiently phase
stable and the satellite orbits can be reconstructed with sufficient accuracy. Averaging visibilities
accumulated over multiple epochs of observations could then help improving the image quality.
With three satellites, closure phases could be used for imaging. Our simulations show that the EHI
could be capable of imaging the black hole shadow of Sgr A* with a resolution of 4 uas (about 8% of the
shadow diameter) within several months of observing time. The EHI concept could thus be used to measure
black hole shadows much more precisely than with ground-based VLBI, allowing for stronger tests
of general relativity and accretion models.
