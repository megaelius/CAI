Measurements of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) 21-cm signal hold the potential to constrain models
of reionization. In this paper we consider a reionization model with three astrophysical parameters
namely (1) the minimum halo mass which can host ionizing sources, $M_{\rm min}$, (2) the number of
ionizing photons escaping into the IGM per baryon within the halo, $N_{\rm ion}$ and (3) the mean
free path of the ionizing photons within the IGM, $R_{\rm mfp}$. We predict the accuracy with which
these parameters can be measured from future observations of the 21-cm power spectrum (PS) using
the upcoming SKA-Low. Unlike several earlier works, we account for the non-Gaussianity of the inherent
EoR 21-cm signal. Considering cosmic variance only and assuming that foregrounds are completely
removed, we find that non-Gaussianity increases the volume of the $1 \sigma$ error ellipsoid of
the parameters by a factor of $133$ relative to the Gaussian predictions, the orientation is also
different. The ratio of the volume of error ellipsoids is $1.65$ and $2.67$ for observation times
of $1024$ and $10000$ hours respectively, when all the $\mathbf{k}$ modes within the foreground
wedge are excluded. With foreground wedge excluded and for $1024$ hours, the 1D marginalized errors
are $(\Delta M_{\rm min}/M_{\rm min},\Delta N_{\rm ion}/N_{\rm ion},\Delta R_{\rm mfp}/R_{\rm
mfp})=(6.54, 2.71, 7.75) \times 10^{-2}$ which are respectively $2 \%$, $5 \%$ and $23 \%$ larger
than the respective Gaussian predictions. The impact of non-Gaussianity increases for longer
observations, and it is particularly important for $R_{\rm mfp}$.
