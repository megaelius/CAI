This is the third paper of a series reporting the results from the POPSTAR evolutionary synthesis
models. The main goal of this work is to present and discuss the synthetic photometric properties
of Single Stellar Populations (SSPs) resulting from our POPSTAR code. Colours in the Johnson and
SDSS systems, halpha and hbeta luminosities and equivalent widths, and ionising region size, have
been computed for a wide range of metallicity (Z = 0.0001 - 0.05) and age (0.1 Myr to 20 Gyr). We demonstrate
the importance of the contribution of emission lines to broader-band photometry when characterising
stellar populations, through the presentation of both contaminated and non-contaminated colours
(in both the Johnson and SDSS systems). The tabulated colours include stellar and nebular components,
in addition to line emission. The main application of these models is the determination of physical
properties of a given young ionising cluster, when only photometric observations are available;
for an isolated star forming region, the young star cluster models can be used, free from the contamination
of any underlying background stellar population. In most cases, however, the ionising population
is usually embedded in a large and complex system, and the observed photometric properties result
from the combination of a young star-forming burst and the underlying older population of the host.
Therefore, the second objective of this paper is to provide a grid of models useful in the interpretation
of mixed regions where the separation of young and old populations is not sufficiently reliable.
We describe the set of PopStar Spectral Energy Distributions, the derived colours and other photometric
parameters, for mixed populations where an underlying host population is combined in different
mass ratios with a recent ionising burst.
