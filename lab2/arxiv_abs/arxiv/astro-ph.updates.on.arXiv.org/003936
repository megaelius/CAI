We report the discovery of a 10^4 kpc^2 gaseous structure detected in [OII] in an over-dense region
of the COSMOS-Gr30 galaxy group at z~0.725 thanks to deep MUSE Guaranteed Time Observations. We
estimate the total amount of diffuse ionised gas to be of the order of (~5+-3)x10^10 Msun and explore
its physical properties to understand its origin and the source(s) of the ionisation. The MUSE data
allow the identification of a dozen of group members embedded in this structure from emission and
absorption lines. We extracted spectra from small apertures defined for both the diffuse ionised
gas and the galaxies. We investigated the kinematics and ionisation properties of the various galaxies
and extended gas regions thanks to line diagnostics (R23, O32 and [OIII]/H\beta) available within
the MUSE wavelength range. We compared these diagnostics to photo-ionisation models and shock
models. The structure is divided in two kinematically distinct sub-structures. The most extended
sub-structure of ionised gas is likely rotating around a massive galaxy and displays filamentary
patterns linking some galaxies. The second sub-structure links another massive galaxy hosting
an Active Galactic Nucleus to a low mass galaxy but also extends orthogonally to the AGN host disk
over ~35 kpc. This extent is likely ionised by the AGN itself. The location of small diffuse regions
in the R23 vs. O32 diagram is compatible with photo-ionisation. However, the location of three of
these regions in this diagram (low O32, high R23) can also be explained by shocks, which is supported
by their large velocity dispersions. One edge-on galaxy shares the same properties and may be a source
of shocks. Whatever the hypothesis, the extended gas seems to be non primordial. We favour a scenario
where the gas has been extracted from galaxies by tidal forces and AGN triggered by interactions
between at least the two sub-structures.
