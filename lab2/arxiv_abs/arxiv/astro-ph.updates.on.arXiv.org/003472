Horizontal branch (HB) morphology is a complex multiple-parameter problem. Besides the metallicity,
two other leading parameters are the mass loss rate (MLR) and the initial He abundance of the HB progenitors.
Using the STAREV stellar evolution code, we produce a wide array of Extreme Horizontal Branch (EHB)
stars and also examine their post-HB evolution. EHB stars are produced in our calculations by the
so called `delayed (late) hot core flash' scenario. The MLR is increased on the red giant branch (RGB)
to the extent that, prior to reaching core flash conditions, only a very thin H-rich envelope remains
and helium ignition takes place at hotter positions on the HRD. We perform an extensive, self-consistent
parameter study, covering populations I and II (Z=0.0001-0.03), for both normal initial helium
abundances and He-enriched models (up to Y=0.40). For completeness of the study and in order to point
to complete trends, we chose NOT to cut out several combinations (or results of) that may extend beyond
realistic limits. We present results and complete evolutionary tracks for the covered parameter
space, showing in particular that: a) Increased He abundance ON ITS OWN -- without having a significant-enough
MLR on the RGB -- DOES NOT lead to the production of EHB stars; however, b) The bluest (hottest) HB positions
do result from the COMBINED effect of He-enhancement and increased MLR; c) The general trend is that
the effective temperature on the HB increases with decreasing metallicity, but there is an indication
for a halt, or even a reversal of this trend, as Z further decreases below $10^{-3}$; d) EHB stars can
serve as major contributors to the UV flux emanating from their host system. Thus, the present comprehensive
study both complements and lends support to previous, more restricted studies of the HB phase, and
adds results for unexplored regions of the parameter space.
