We study the kinematical properties of galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization via the [CII] 158$\mu$m
line emission. The line profile provides information on the kinematics as well as structural properties
such as the presence of a disk and satellites. To understand how these properties are encoded in the
line profile, first we develop analytical models from which we identify disk inclination and gas
turbulent motions as the key parameters affecting the line profile. To gain further insights, we
use "Althaea", a highly-resolved ($30\, \rm pc$) simulated prototypical Lyman Break Galaxy, in
the redshift range $z = 6-7$, when the galaxy is in a very active assembling phase. Based on morphology,
we select three main dynamical stages: I) Merger , II) Spiral Disk, and III) Disturbed Disk. We identify
spectral signatures of merger events, spiral arms, and extra-planar flows in I), II), and III),
respectively. We derive a generalised dynamical mass vs. [CII]-line FWHM relation. If precise
information on the galaxy inclination is (not) available, the returned mass estimate is accurate
within a factor $2$ ($4$). A Tully-Fisher relation is found for the observed high-$z$ galaxies,
i.e. $L_{\rm[CII]}\propto (FWHM)^{1.80\pm 0.35}$ for which we provide a simple, physically-based
interpretation. Finally, we perform mock ALMA simulations to check the detectability of [CII].
When seen face-on, Althaea is always detected at $> 5\sigma$; in the edge-on case it remains undetected
because the larger intrinsic FWHM pushes the line peak flux below detection limit. This suggests
that some of the reported non-detections might be due to inclination effects.
