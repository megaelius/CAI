In the context of the study of the Integrated Sachs Wolfe effect (ISW), we construct a template of
the projected density distribution up to $z\simeq 0.7$ by using the Luminous Galaxies (LGs) from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR8. We use a photo-z catalogue trained with more than a hundred thousand
galaxies from BOSS in the SDSS DR8 imaging area. We consider two different LG samples whose selection
matches that of SDSS-III/BOSS: the LOWZ sample ($z\in [0.15,0.5]$) and the CMASS sample ($z\in[0.4,0.7]$).
When building the LG density maps we use the information from star density, survey footprint, seeing
conditions, sky emission, dust extinction and airmass to explore the impact of these artifacts
on the two LG samples. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the CMASS sample is particularly
sensitive to Galactic stars, which dominate the contribution to the auto-angular power spectrum
below $\ell=7$. Other potential systematics affect mostly the low multipole range ($\ell\in[2,7]$),
but leave fluctuations on smaller scales practically unchanged. The resulting power spectra in
the multipole range $\ell\in[2,100]$ for the LOWZ, CMASS and LOWZ+CMASS samples are compatible
with linear $\Lambda$CDM expectations and constant bias values of $b=1.98 \pm 0.11$, $2.08\pm0.14$
and $1.88\pm 0.11$, respectively, with no traces of non-Gaussianity: $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm local}=59\pm
75$ at 95% confidence level for the full LOWZ+CMASS sample in the range $\ell\in[4,100]$. After
cross-correlating WMAP-9yr data with the LOWZ+CMASS LG density field, the ISW signal is detected
at the level of 1.62--1.69$\,\sigma$. While this result is in close agreement with predictions
from Monte Carlo simulations in the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model, it cannot rule out by itself
an Einstein-de Sitter scenario, and has a moderately low signal compared to previous studies conducted
on subsets of this LG sample.
