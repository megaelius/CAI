The role played by magnetic field during star formation is an important topic in astrophysics. We
investigate the correlation between the orientation of star-forming cores (as defined by the core
major axes) and ambient magnetic field directions in 1) a 3D MHD simulation, 2) synthetic observations
generated from the simulation at different viewing angles, and 3) observations of nearby molecular
clouds. We find that the results on relative alignment between cores and background magnetic field
in synthetic observations slightly disagree with those measured in fully 3D simulation data, which
is partly because cores identified in projected 2D maps tend to coexist within filamentary structures,
while 3D cores are generally more rounded. In addition, we examine the progression of magnetic field
from pc- to core-scale in the simulation, which is consistent with the anisotropic core formation
model that gas preferably flow along the magnetic field toward dense cores. When comparing the observed
cores identified from the GBT Ammonia Survey (GAS) and Planck polarization-inferred magnetic
field orientations, we find that the relative core-field alignment has a regional dependence among
different clouds. More specifically, we find that dense cores in the Taurus molecular cloud tend
to align perpendicular to the background magnetic field, while those in Perseus and Ophiuchus tend
to have random (Perseus) or slightly parallel (Ophiuchus) orientations with respect to the field.
We argue that this feature of relative core-field orientation could be used to probe the relative
significance of the magnetic field within the cloud.
