Context: The fast rotator, pre-main sequence star AB Dor A is a strong and persistent radio emitter.
The extraordinary coronal flaring activity is thought to be the origin of compact radio emission
and other associated phenomena as large slingshot prominences. Aim: We aim to investigate the radio
emission mechanism and the milliarcsecond radio structure around AB Dor A. Methods: We performed
phase-referenced VLBI observations at 22.3 GHz, 8.4 GHz, and 1.4 GHz over more than one decade using
the Australian VLBI array. Results: Our 8.4 GHz images show a double core-halo morphology, similar
at all epochs, with emission extending at heights between 5 and 18 stellar radii. Furthermore, the
sequence of the 8.4 GHz maps shows a clear variation of the source structure within the observing
time. However, images at 1.4 GHz and 22.3 GHz are compatible with a compact source. The phase-reference
position at 8.4 GHz and 1.4 GHz are coincident with those expected from the well-known milliarcsecond-precise
astrometry of this star, meanwhile the 22.3 GHz position is 4$\sigma$ off the prediction in the north-west
direction. The origin of this offset is still unclear. Conclusions: We have considered several
models to explain the morphology and evolution of the inner radio structure detected in AB Dor A which
include emission from the stellar polar caps, a flaring, magnetically-driven loop structure,
and the presence of helmet streamers. A possible close companion to AB Dor A has been also investigated.
Our results confirm the extraordinary coronal magnetic activity of this star, able to produce compact
radio structures at very large heights, so far only seen in binary interacting systems.
