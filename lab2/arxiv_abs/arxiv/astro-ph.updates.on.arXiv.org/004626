We use Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations of the galaxy cluster MACS J1149.5+2223
to explore the kinematics of the grand-design spiral galaxy Sp1149 hosting the SN Refsdal. Sp1149
lies at $z\simeq1.49$, has a stellar mass $M_*\simeq5\times10^9 \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$, a star-formation
rate $\mathrm{SFR} \simeq1-6 \, \mathrm{M_\odot/yr}$ and represents a likely progenitor of a
Milky-Way-like galaxy. All the four multiple images of Sp1149 in our data show strong OII-line emissions
pointing to a clear rotation pattern. We take advantage of the gravitational lensing magnification
effect ($\simeq 4 \times$) on the OII emission of the least distorted image to fit 3D kinematic models
to the MUSE data-cube and derive the rotation curve and the velocity dispersion profile of Sp1149.
We find that the rotation curve steeply rises, peaks at $R\simeq1$ kpc and then (initially) declines
and flattens to an average $V_\mathrm{flat} = 128^{+29}_{-19}$ km/s. The shape of the rotation
curve is well determined but the actual value of $V_\mathrm{flat}$ is quite uncertain because of
the nearly face-on configuration of the galaxy. The intrinsic velocity dispersion due to gas turbulence
is almost constant across the entire disc with an average of $27\pm5$ km/s. This value is consistent
with $z=0$ measurements in the ionized gas component and a factor 2-4 lower than other estimates
in different galaxies at similar redshifts. The average stellar-to-total mass fraction is of the
order of one fifth. Our kinematic analysis returns the picture of a regular star-forming, mildly
turbulent, rotation-dominated ($V / \sigma\simeq5$) spiral galaxy in a 4 Gyr old Universe.
