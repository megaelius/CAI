The number and properties of observed gravitational microlensing events depend on the distribution
and kinematics of stars and other compact objects along the line of sight. In particular, precise
measurements of the microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Galactic bulge enable
strict tests of competing models of the Milky Way. Previous estimates, based on samples of up to a
few hundred events, gave larger values than expected from the Galactic models and were difficult
to reconcile with other constraints on the Galactic structure. Here we used long-term photometric
observations of the Galactic bulge by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) to select
a homogeneous sample of 8000 gravitational microlensing events. We created the largest and most
accurate microlensing optical depth and event rate maps of the Galactic bulge. The new maps ease
the tension between the previous measurements and Galactic models. They are consistent with some
earlier calculations based on bright stars and are systematically ~30% smaller than the other estimates
based on "all-source" samples of microlensing events. The difference is caused by the careful estimation
of the source star population. The new maps agree well with predictions based on the Besancon model
of the Galaxy. Apart from testing the Milky Way models, our maps may have numerous other applications,
such as the measurement of the initial mass function or constraining the dark matter content in the
Milky Way center. The new maps will also inform the planning of future space-based microlensing
experiments by revising the expected number of events.
