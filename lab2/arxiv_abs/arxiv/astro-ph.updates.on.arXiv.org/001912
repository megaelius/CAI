The disparity between the density profiles of galactic dark matter haloes predicted by dark matter
only cosmological simulations and those inferred from rotation curve decomposition, the so-called
cusp-core problem, suggests that baryonic physics has an impact on dark matter density in the central
regions of galaxies. Feedback from black holes, supernovae and massive stars may each play a role
by removing matter from the centre of the galaxy on shorter timescales than the dynamical time of
the dark matter halo. Our goal in this paper is to determine constraints on such feedback scenarios
based on the observed properties of a set of nearby galaxies. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
analysis of galactic rotation curves, via a method developed in a previous paper, we constrain density
profiles and an estimated minimum radius for baryon influence, $r_1$, which we couple with a feedback
model to give an estimate of the fraction of matter within that radius that must be expelled to produce
the presently observed halo profile. We show that in the case of the gas rich dwarf irregular galaxy
DDO 154, an outflow from a central source (e.g. a black hole or star forming region) could produce
sufficient feedback on the halo without removing the disk gas. We examine the rotation curves of
8 galaxies taken from the THINGS data set and determine constraints on the radial density profiles
of their dark matter haloes. For some of the galaxies, both cored haloes and cosmological $\rho \propto
r^{-1}$ cusps are excluded. These intermediate central slopes require baryonic feedback to be
finely tuned. We also find for galaxies which exhibit extended cores in their haloes (e.g. NGC 925),
the use of a split power-law halo profile yields models without the unphysical, sharp features seen
in models based on the Einasto profile.
