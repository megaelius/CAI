Magnetic fields generated by a dynamo mechanism due to differential rotation during stellar mergers
are often proposed as an explanation for the presence of strong fields in certain classes of magnetic
stars, including high field magnetic white dwarfs (HFMWDs). In the case of the HFMWDs, the site of
the differential rotation has been variously proposed to be the common envelope itself, the massive
hot outer regions of a merged degenerate core or an accretion disc formed by a tidally disrupted companion
that is subsequently incorporated into a degenerate core. In the present study I explore the possibility
that the origin of HFMWDs is consistent with stellar interactions during the common envelope evolution
(CEE). In this picture the observed fields are caused by an $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo driven by differential
rotation. The strongest fields would arise when the differential rotation equals the critical
break up velocity and would occur from the merging of two stars during CEE or double degenerate (DD)
mergers in a post common envelope (CE) stage. Those systems that do not coalesce but emerge from the
CE on a close orbit and about to initiate mass transfer will evolve into magnetic cataclysmic variables
(MCVs), The population synthesis calculations carried out in this work have shown that the origin
of high fields in isolated white dwarfs (WDs) and in WDs in MCVs is consistent with stellar interaction
during common envelope evolution. I compare the calculated field strengths to those observed and
test the correlation between theory and observation by means of the Kolmogorov--Smirnov (K--S)
test and show that the resulting correlation is good for values of the CE energy efficiency parameter,
$\alpha{_{\rm{CE}}}$, in the range 0.1--0.3.
