Emission from the radioactive trace element $^{26}$Al has been observed throughout the Milky Way
with the COMPTEL and INTEGRAL satellites. In particular the Doppler shifts measured with INTEGRAL
connect $^{26}$Al with superbubbles, which may guide $^{26}$Al flows off spiral arms in the direction
of Galactic rotation. In order to test this paradigm, we have performed galaxy-scale simulations
of superbubbles with $^{26}$Al injection in a Milky Way-type galaxy. We produce all-sky synthetic
$\gamma-$ray emission maps of the simulated galaxies. We find that the 1809keV emission from the
radioactive decay of $^{26}$Al is highly variable with time and the observer's position. This allows
us to estimate an additional systematic variability of 0.2dex for a star formation rate derived
from $^{26}$Al for different times and measurement locations in Milky Way-type galaxies. High-latitude
morphological features indicate nearby emission with correspondingly high integrated $\gamma-$ray
intensities. We demonstrate that the $^{26}$Al scale height from our simulated galaxies depends
on the assumed halo gas density. We present the first synthetic 1809keV longitude-velocity diagrams
from 3D hydrodynamic simulations. The line-of-sight velocities for $^{26}$Al can be significantly
different from the line-of-sight velocities associated with the cold gas. Over time, $^{26}$Al
velocities consistent with the INTEGRAL observations, within uncertainties, appear at any given
longitude, broadly supporting previous suggestions that $^{26}$Al injected into expanding superbubbles
by massive stars may be responsible for the high velocities found in the INTEGRAL observations.
We discuss the effect of systematically varying the location of the superbubbles relative to the
spiral arms.
