Massive stars are often found in binary systems and it has been argued that binary products boost
the ionizing radiation of stellar populations. Accurate predictions for binary products are needed
to understand and quantify their contribution to Cosmic Reionization. We investigate the contribution
of stars stripped in binaries since (1) they are, arguably, the best-understood products of binary
evolution, (2) we recently produced the first non-LTE radiative transfer calculations for the
atmospheres of these stripped stars that predict their ionizing spectra, and (3) they are very promising
sources since they boost the ionizing emission of stellar populations at late times. This allows
stellar feedback to clear the surroundings such that a higher fraction of their photons can escape
and ionize the intergalactic medium. Combining our detailed predictions for the ionizing spectra
with a simple cosmic reionization model, we estimate that stripped stars contributed tens of percent
of the photons that caused cosmic reionization of hydrogen, depending on the assumed escape fractions.
More importantly, stripped stars harden the ionizing emission. We estimate that the spectral index
for the ionizing part of the spectrum can increase to -1 compared to <-2 for single stars. At high redshift,
stripped stars and massive single stars combined dominate the HeII-ionizing emission, but we expect
active galactic nuclei drive cosmic helium reionization. Further observational consequences
we expect are (1) high ionization states for the intergalactic gas surrounding stellar systems,
such as CIV and SiIV and (2) additional heating of the intergalactic medium of up to a few thousand
Kelvin. Quantifying these warrants the inclusion of accurate models for stripped stars and other
binary products in full cosmological simulations.
