For filter-based magnetographs, the linear calibration method under the weak-field assumption
is usually adopted; this leads to magnetic saturation effect in the regions with strong magnetic
field. This article explores a new method to overcome the above disadvantage using a multilayer
perceptron network, which we call MagMLP, based on a back-propagation algorithm with one input
layer, five hidden layers, and one output layer. We use the data from the \textit{Spectropolarimeter}
(SP) on board \textit{Hinode} to simulate single-wavelength observations for the model training,
and take into account the influence of the Doppler velocity field and the filling factor. The training
results show that the linear fitting coefficient (LFC) of the transverse field reaches above 0.91,
and that of the longitudinal field is above 0.98. The generalization of the models is good because
the corresponding LFCs are above 0.9 for the test subsets. Compared with the linear calibration
method, the MagMLP is much more effective on dealing with the magnetic saturation effect. Analyzing
an active region, the results of the linear calibration present an evident magnetic saturation
effect in the umbra regions; the corresponding systematic error reaches values greater than 1000
G in most areas, or even exceeds 2000 G at some pixels. However, the results of MagMLP at these locations
are very close to the inversion results, and the systematic errors are basically within 300 G. In
addition, we find that there are many "bright spots" and "dark spots" on the inclination angle images
from the inversion results of \textit{Hinode}/SP with values of 180 and 0 degrees, respectively,
where the inversion is not reliable and does not produce a good result; the MagMLP handles these points
well.
