The Galactic disk is expected to be spatially, kinematically, and chemically clustered on many
scales due to both star formation and non-axisymmetries in the Galactic potential. In this work
we calculate the spatial and kinematic two-point correlation functions using a sample of $1.7 \times
10^6$ stars within 1 kpc of the Sun with 6D phase space information available from \textit{Gaia}
DR2. Clustering is detected on spatial scales of 1-300 pc and velocity scales of at least 15 km s$^{-1}$.
With bound structures included, the data have a power-law index ($\xi(\Delta r) \propto \Delta
r^{\gamma}$) of $\gamma\approx-2$ at most spatial scales, which is in line with theoretical predictions.
After removing bound structures, the data have a power-law index of $\gamma\approx-1$ for $<100$
pc and $\gamma \lesssim -1.5$ for $>100$ pc. We interpret these results with the aid of a novel star-by-star
simulation of the Galaxy in which stars are born in clusters orbiting in a realistic potential that
includes spiral arms, a bar, and GMCs. We find that the simulation largely agrees with the observations
(within a factor of 2-3) at all spatial and kinematic scales. In detail, the correlation function
in the simulation is shallower than the data at $< 20$ pc scales, and steeper than the data at $> 30$
pc scales. We also find a persistent clustering signal in the kinematic correlation function for
the data at large $\Delta v$ ($>5$ km s$^{-1}$) not present in the simulations. We speculate that
this mismatch between observations and simulations may be due to two processes not included in the
simulation: hierarchical star formation and transient spiral arms. We also use the simulations
to predict the clustering signal as a function of pair-wise metallicity and age separations. Ages
and metallicities measured with a precision of $50\%$ and $0.05$ dex are required in order to enhance
the clustering signal.
