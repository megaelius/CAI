Weak lensing by large-scale structure is a powerful probe of cosmology and of the dark universe.
This cosmic shear technique relies on the accurate measurement of the shapes and redshifts of background
galaxies and requires precise control of systematic errors. The Monte Carlo Control Loops (MCCL)
is a forward modelling method designed to tackle this problem. It relies on the Ultra Fast Image Generator
(UFig) to produce simulated images tuned to match the target data statistically, followed by calibrations
and tolerance loops. We present the first end-to-end application of this method, on the Dark Energy
Survey (DES) Year 1 wide field imaging data. We simultaneously measure the shear power spectrum
$C_{\ell}$ and the redshift distribution $n(z)$ of the background galaxy sample. The method includes
maps of the systematic sources, Point Spread Function (PSF), an Approximate Bayesian Computation
(ABC) inference of the simulation model parameters, a shear calibration scheme, and the fast estimation
of the covariance matrix. We find a close statistical agreement between the simulations and the
DES Y1 data using an array of diagnostics. In a non-tomographic setting, we derive a set of $C_\ell$
and $n(z)$ curves that encode the cosmic shear measurement, as well as the systematic uncertainty.
Following a blinding scheme, we measure the combination of $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, and intrinsic
alignment amplitude $A_{\rm{IA}}$, defined as $S_8D_{\rm{IA}} = \sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}D_{\rm{IA}}$,
where $D_{\rm{IA}}=1-0.11(A_{\rm{IA}}-1)$. We find $S_8D_{\rm{IA}}=0.895^{+0.054}_{-0.039}$,
where systematics are at the level of roughly 60\% of the statistical errors. We discuss these results
in the context of earlier cosmic shear analyses of the DES Y1 data. Our findings indicate that this
method and its fast runtime offer good prospects for cosmic shear measurements with future wide-field
surveys.
