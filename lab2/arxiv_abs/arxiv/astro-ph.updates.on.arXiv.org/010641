The presence of mean motion resonances (MMRs) complicates analysis and fitting of planetary systems
observed through the radial velocity (RV) technique. MMR can allow planets to remain stable in regions
of phase space where strong planet-planet interactions would otherwise destabilize the system.
These stable orbits can occupy small phase space volumes, allowing MMRs to strongly constrain system
parameters, but making searches for stable orbital parameters challenging. Furthermore, libration
of the resonant angle and dynamical interaction between the planets introduces another, long period
variation into the observed RV signal, complicating analysis of the periods of the planets in the
system. We discuss this phenomenon using the example of HD 200964. By searching through parameter
space and numerically integrating each proposed set of planetary parameters to test for long term
stability, we find stable solutions in the 7:5 and 3:2 MMRs in addition to the originally identified
4:3 MMR. The 7:5 configuration provides the best match to the data, while the 3:2 configuration provides
the most easily understood formation scenario. In reanalysis of the originally published shorter-baseline
data, we find fits in both the 4:3 and 3:2 resonances, but not the 7:5. Because the time baseline of
the data is less than the resonant libration period, the current best fit to the data may not reflect
the actual resonant configuration. In the absence of a full sample of the longer libration period,
we find that it is of paramount importance to incorporate long term stability when fitting for the
system's orbital configuration.
