The gravity field maps of the satellite gravimetry missions GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate
Experiment) and GRACE Follow-On are derived by means of precise orbit determination. The key observation
is the biased inter-satellite range, which is measured primarily by a K-Band Ranging system (KBR)
in GRACE and GRACE Follow-On. The GRACE Follow-On satellites are additionally equipped with a Laser
Ranging Interferometer (LRI), which provides measurements with lower noise compared to the KBR.
The biased range of KBR and LRI needs to be converted for gravity field recovery into an instantaneous
range, i.e. the biased Euclidean distance between the satellites' center-of-mass at the same time.
One contributor to the difference between measured and instantaneous range arises due to the non-zero
travel time of electro-magnetic waves between the spacecraft. We revisit the calculation of the
light time correction (LTC) from first principles considering general relativistic effects and
state-of-the-art models of Earth's potential field. The novel analytical expressions for the
LTC of KBR and LRI can circumvent numerical limitations of the classical approach. The dependency
of the LTC on geopotential models and on the parameterization is studied, and afterwards the results
are compared against the LTC provided in the official datasets of GRACE and GRACE Follow-On. It is
shown that the new approach has a significantly lower noise, well below the instrument noise of current
instruments, especially relevant for the LRI, and even if used with kinematic orbit products. This
allows calculating the LTC accurate enough even for the next generation of gravimetric missions.
