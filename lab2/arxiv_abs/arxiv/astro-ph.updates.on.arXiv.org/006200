Current investigations of exoplanet biosignatures have focused on static evidence of life, such
as the presence of biogenic gases like O2 or CH4. However, the expected diversity of terrestrial
planet atmospheres and the likelihood of both false positives and false negatives for conventional
biosignatures motivate exploration of additional life detection strategies, including time-varying
signals. Seasonal variation in atmospheric composition is a biologically modulated phenomenon
on Earth that may occur elsewhere because it arises naturally from the interplay between the biosphere
and time-variable insolation. The search for seasonality as a biosignature would avoid many assumptions
about specific metabolisms and provide an opportunity to directly quantify biological fluxes--allowing
us to characterize, rather than simply recognize, biospheres on exoplanets. Despite this potential,
there have been no comprehensive studies of seasonality as an exoplanet biosignature. Here, we
provide a foundation for further studies by reviewing both biological and abiological controls
on the magnitude and detectability of seasonality of atmospheric CO2, CH4, O2, and O3 on Earth. We
also consider an example of an inhabited world for which atmospheric seasonality may be the most
notable expression of its biosphere. We show that life on a low O2 planet like the weakly oxygenated
mid-Proterozoic Earth could be fingerprinted by seasonal variation in O3 as revealed in its UV Hartley-Huggins
bands. This example highlights the need for UV capabilities in future direct-imaging telescope
missions (e.g., LUVOIR/HabEx) and illustrates the diagnostic importance of studying temporal
biosignatures for exoplanet life detection/characterization.
