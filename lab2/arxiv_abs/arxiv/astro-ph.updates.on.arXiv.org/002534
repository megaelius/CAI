The new planet finder for the Very Large Telescope (VLT), the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast
Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE), just had its first light in Paranal. A dedicated instrument for the
direct detection of planets, SPHERE, is composed of a polametric camera in visible light, the Zurich
IMager POLarimeter (ZIMPOL), and two near-infrared sub-systems: the Infra-Red Dual-beam Imager
and Spectrograph (IRDIS), a multi-purpose camera for imaging, polarimetry, and long-slit spectroscopy,
and the integral field spectrograph (IFS), an integral field spectrograph. We present the results
obtained from the analysis of data taken during the laboratory integration and validation phase,
after the injection of synthetic planets. Since no continuous field rotation could be performed
in the laboratory, this analysis presents results obtained using reduction techniques that do
not use the angular differential imaging (ADI) technique. To perform the simulations, we used the
instrumental point spread function (PSF) and model spectra of L and T-type objects scaled in contrast
with respect to the host star. We evaluated the expected error in astrometry and photometry as a function
of the signal to noise of companions, after spectral differential imaging (SDI) reduction for IRDIS
and spectral deconvolution (SD) or principal component analysis (PCA) data reductions for IFS.
We deduced from our analysis, for example, that $\beta$Picb, a 12~Myr old planet of $\sim$10~\MJ
and semi-major axis of 9--10 AU, would be detected with IRDIS with a photometric error of 0.16~mag
and with a relative astrometric position error of 1.1~mas. With IFS, we could retrieve a spectrum
with error bars of about 0.15~mag on each channel and astrometric relative position error of 0.6~mas.
For a fainter object such as HR8799d, a 13~\MJ planet at a distance of 27~AU, IRDIS could obtain a relative
astrometric error of 3~mas.
