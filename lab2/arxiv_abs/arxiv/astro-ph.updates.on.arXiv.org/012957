We present a detailed visible and near-IR spectro-interferometric analysis of the Be-shell star
$\omicron$ Aquarii from quasi-contemporaneous CHARA/VEGA and VLTI/AMBER observations. We measured
the stellar radius of $\omicron$ Aquarii as 4.0 $\pm$ 0.3 $\mathrm{R_{\odot}}$. We constrained
the disk geometry and kinematics using a kinematic model and a MCMC fitting procedure. The disk sizes
in H$\alpha$ and Br$\gamma$ were found to be similar, at $\sim$10-12 $\mathrm{D_{\star}}$, which
is uncommon since most results for Be stars show a larger extension in H$\alpha$ than in Br$\gamma$.
We found that the inclination angle $i$ derived from H$\alpha$ is significantly lower ($\sim$15
deg) than the one derived from Br$\gamma$. The disk kinematics were found to be near to the Keplerian
rotation in Br$\gamma$, but not in H$\alpha$. After analyzing all our data using a grid of HDUST models
(BeAtlas), we found a common physical description for the disk in both lines: $\Sigma_{0}$ = 0.12
g cm\textsuperscript{-2} and $m$ = 3.0. The stellar rotational rate was found to be very close ($\sim$96\%)
to the critical value. Our analysis of multi-epoch H$\alpha$ profiles and imaging polarimetry
indicates that the disk has been stable for at least 20 years. Compared to Br$\gamma$, the data in
H$\alpha$ shows a substantially different picture that cannot fully be understood using the current
physical models of Be star disks. $\omicron$ Aquarii presents a stable disk, but the measured $m$
is lower than the standard value in the VDD model for steady-state. Such long-term stability can
be understood in terms of the high rotational rate for this star, the rate being a main source for the
mass injection in the disk. Our results on the stellar rotation and disk stability are consistent
with results in the literature showing that late-type Be stars are more likely to be fast rotators
and have stable disks.
