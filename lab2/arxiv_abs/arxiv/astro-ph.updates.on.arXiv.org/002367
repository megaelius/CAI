Owing to the advent of large area photometric surveys, the possibility to use broad band photometric
data, instead of spectra, to measure the size of the broad line region of active galactic nuclei,
has raised a large interest. We describe here a new method using time-delay lensed quasars where
one or several images are affected by microlensing due to stars in the lensing galaxy. Because microlensing
decreases (or increases) the flux of the continuum compared to the broad line region, it changes
the contrast between these two emission components. We show that this effect can be used to effectively
disentangle the intrinsic variability of those two regions, offering the opportunity to perform
reverberation mapping based on single band photometric data. Based on simulated light curves generated
using a damped random walk model of quasar variability, we show that measurement of the size of the
broad line region can be achieved using this method, provided one spectrum has been obtained independently
during the monitoring. This method is complementary to photometric reverberation mapping and
could also be extended to multi-band data. Because the effect described above produces a variability
pattern in difference light curves between pairs of lensed images which is correlated with the time-lagged
continuum variability, it can potentially produce systematic errors in measurement of time delays
between pairs of lensed images. Simple simulations indicate that time-delay measurement techniques
which use a sufficiently flexible model for the extrinsic variability are not affected by this effect
and produce accurate time delays.
