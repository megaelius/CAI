We suggest that Bipolar H{\sc ii} Regions may be the aftermath of collisions between clouds. Such
a collision will produce a shock-compressed layer, and a star cluster can then condense out of the
dense gas near the centre of the layer. If the clouds are sufficiently massive, the star cluster is
likely to contain at least one massive star, which emits ionising radiation, and excites an H{\sc
ii} region, which then expands, sweeping up the surrounding neutral gas. Once most of the matter
in the clouds has accreted onto the layer, expansion of the H{\sc ii} Region meets little resistance
in directions perpendicular to the mid-plane of the layer, and so it expands rapidly to produce two
lobes of ionised gas, one on each side of the layer. Conversely, in directions parallel to the mid-plane
of the layer, expansion of the H{\sc ii} Region stalls due to the ram-pressure of the gas that continues
to fall towards the star cluster from the outer parts of the layer; a ring of dense neutral gas builds
up around the waist of the Bipolar H{\sc ii} Region, and may spawn a second generation of star formation.
In this paper we present a dimensionless model for the flow of ionised gas in a Bipolar H{\sc ii} Region
created according to the above scenario, and predict the characteristics of the resulting freefree
continuum and recombination-line emission. This dimensionless model can be scaled to the physical
parameters of any particular system. Our intention is that these predictions will be useful in testing
the scenario outlined above, and thereby providing indirect support for the role of cloud/cloud
collisions in triggering star formation.
