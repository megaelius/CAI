Intermediate mass black holes (10$^3$-10$^5$ M$_\odot$) in the center of dwarf galaxies are believed
to be analogous to growing Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe. Their characterization
can provide insight about the early galaxies. We present optical and near-infrared integral field
spectroscopy of the inner $\sim$50 pc of the dwarf galaxy NGC4395, known to harbor an AGN. NGC 4395
is an ideal candidate to investigate the nature of dwarf AGN, as it is nearby ($d\approx4.4$ Mpc)
enough to allow a close look at its nucleus. The optical data were obtained with the Gemini GMOS-IFU
covering the 4500 A to 7300 A spectral range at a spatial resolution of 10 pc. The J and K-band spectra
were obtained with the Gemini NIFS at spatial resolutions of $\sim$5 pc. The gas kinematics show
a compact, rotation disk component with a projected velocity amplitude of 25 km s$^{-1}$. We estimate
a mass of $7.7\times10^5$ M$_\odot$ inside a radius of 10 pc. From the H$\alpha$ broad line component,
we estimate the AGN bolometric luminosity as $L_{ bol}=(9.9\pm1.4)\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$
and a mass $M_{ BH}=(2.5^{+1.0}_{-0.8})\times10^5$ M$_\odot$ for the central black hole. The
mean surface mass densities for the ionized and molecular gas are in the ranges (1-2) M$_{\odot}
$pc$^{-2}$ and (1-4)$\times10^{-3}$ M${_\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$ and the average ratio between ionized
and hot molecular gas masses is $\sim$500. The emission-line flux distributions reveal an elongated
structure at 24 pc west of the nucleus, which is blueshifted relative to the systemic velocity of
the galaxy by $\approx$30 km s$^{-1}$. We speculate that this structure is originated by the accretion
of a gas-rich small satellite or by a low metallicity cosmic cloud.
