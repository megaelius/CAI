The Tarantula region in the Large Magellanic Cloud contains the richest population of spatially
resolved massive O-type stars known so far. This unmatched sample offers an opportunity to test
models describing their main-sequence evolution and mass-loss properties. Using ground-based
optical spectroscopy obtained in the framework of the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey (VFTS), we aim
to determine stellar, photospheric and wind properties of 72 presumably single O-type giants,
bright giants and supergiants and to confront them with predictions of stellar evolution and of
line-driven mass-loss theories. We apply an automated method for quantitative spectroscopic
analysis of O stars combining the non-LTE stellar atmosphere model {{\sc fastwind}} with the genetic
fitting algorithm {{\sc pikaia}} to determine the following stellar properties: effective temperature,
surface gravity, mass-loss rate, helium abundance, and projected rotational velocity. We present
empirical effective temperature versus spectral subtype calibrations at LMC-metallicity for
giants and supergiants. In the spectroscopic and classical Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams, our
sample O stars are found to occupy the region predicted to be the core hydrogen-burning phase by Brott
et al. (2011) and K\"{o}hler et al. (2015). Except for five stars, the helium abundance of our sample
stars is in agreement with the initial LMC composition. The aforementioned five stars present moderate
projected rotational velocities (i.e., $v_{\mathrm{e}}\,\sin\,i\,<\,200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$)
and hence do not agree with current predictions of rotational mixing in main-sequence stars. Adopting
theoretical results for the wind velocity law, we find modified wind momenta for LMC stars that are
$\sim$0.3 dex higher than earlier results. [Due to the limitation of characters, the abstract appearing
