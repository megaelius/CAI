Nebular emission lines are critical to measure physical properties in the ionized gas (e.g., metallicity,
the SFR, or dust attenuation). They also account for a significant fraction of broadband fluxes,
in particular at the highest redshifts, and therefore can strongly affect the determination of
other physical properties, such as the stellar mass, which are crucial in shaping our understanding
of galaxy formation and evolution. We investigate a sample of 51 LBGs at 3.0<z<3.8 with detected
[OIII] line emissions and estimated the physical properties of these galaxies to examine the impact
of including nebular emission data in the SED fitting. We used CIGALE to fit the rest-frame UV-to-NIR
SEDs of these galaxies and their emission line data simultaneously. We ran CIGALE with and without
the nebular model or the emission line data, and compare the results to show the importance of including
the nebular emission line data in the SED fitting. We find that without the nebular model, the fitting
overestimates the stellar mass due to the strong [OIII] lines that are redshifted to the Ks-band,
consistent with previous results. The emission line data are necessary to constrain the nebular
model in the SED fitting. Examining the Ks-band excess, which is mostly used to estimate the emissions
of the [OIII]+Hb lines when there is no spectral data, we find that the estimation and observation
are statistically consistent. However, the difference can reach up to more than 1 dex in some catastrophic
cases, which shows the importance of obtaining spectroscopic measurements for these lines. We
also estimate the equivalent width of the Hb absorption and find it negligible compared to the Hb
emission. We conclude that line emission is important to constrain the nebular models and to obtain
reliable estimates of the physical properties of galaxies. These data should be taken into account
in the SED fitting.
