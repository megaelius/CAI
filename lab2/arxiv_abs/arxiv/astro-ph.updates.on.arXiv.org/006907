The dust sub-millimetre polarisation of star-forming clouds carries information on dust and the
role of magnetic fields in cloud evolution. With observations of a dense filamentary cloud G035.39-00.33,
we aim to characterise the dust emission properties and the variations of the polarisation fraction.
JCMT SCUBA-2/POL-2 data at 850um are combined with Planck 850um (353GHz) data to map polarisation
fractions. With previous SCUBA-2 observations (450um and 850um) and Herschel data, the column
densities are determined via modified blackbody fits and via radiative transfer modelling. Models
are constructed to examine how the polarisation angles and fractions depend on potential magnetic
field geometries and grain alignment. POL-2 data show clear changes in the magnetic field orientation.
The filament has a peak column density of N(H2)~7 10^22 cm-2, a minimum dust temperature of T~12 K,
and a mass of some 4300Msun for the area N(H2)> 5 10^21 cm-2. The estimated average value of the dust
opacity spectral index is beta ~ 1.9. The ratio of sub-millimetre and J band optical depths is tau(250
um)/tau(J) ~ 2.5 10^-3, more than four times the typical values for diffuse medium. The polarisation
fraction decreases as a function of column density to p ~ 1% in the central filament. Because of noise,
the observed decrease of p(N) is significant only at N(H2)>2 10^22 cm-2. The observations suggest
that the grain alignment is not constant. Although the data can be explained with a complete loss
of alignment at densities above ~ 10^4 cm-3 or using the predictions of radiative torques alignment,
the uncertainty of the field geometry and the spatial filtering of the SCUBA-2 data prevent strong
conclusions. G035.39-00.33 shows strong signs of dust evolution and the low polarisation fraction
is suggestive of a loss of polarised emission from its densest parts.
