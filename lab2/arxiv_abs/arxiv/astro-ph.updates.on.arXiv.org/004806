We present high-resolution ($\sim$ 0.1 pc), hydrodynamical and magneto-hydrodynamical simulations
to investigate whether the observed level of molecular cloud (MC) turbulence can be generated and
maintained by external supernova (SN) explosions. The MCs are formed self-consistently within
their large-scale galactic environment following the non-equilibrium formation of H$_2$ and
CO including (self-) shielding and important heating and cooling processes. The MCs inherit their
initial level of turbulence from the diffuse ISM, where turbulence is injected by SN explosions.
However, by systematically exploring the effect of individual SNe going off outside the clouds,
we show that at later stages the importance of SN driven turbulence is decreased significantly.
This holds for different MC masses as well as MCs with and without magnetic fields. The SN impact also
decreases rapidly with larger distances. Nearby SNe ($d$ $\sim$ 25 pc) boost the turbulent velocity
dispersions of the MC by up to 70 per cent (up to a few km s$^{-1}$). For $d$ $>$ 50 pc, however, their
impact decreases fast with increasing $d$ and is almost negligible. For all probed distances the
gain in velocity dispersion decays rapidly within a few 100 kyr. This is significantly shorter than
the average timescale for a MC to be hit by a nearby SN under solar neighbourhood conditions ($\sim$
2 Myr). Hence, at these conditions SNe are not able to sustain the observed level of MC turbulence.
However, in environments with high gas surface densities and SN rates like the Central Molecular
Zone, observed elevated MC dispersions could be triggered by external SNe.
