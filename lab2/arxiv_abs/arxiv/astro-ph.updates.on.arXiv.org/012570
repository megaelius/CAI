The astrophysical $s$-process is one of the two main processes forming elements heavier than iron.
A key outstanding uncertainty surrounding $s$-process nucleosynthesis is the neutron flux generated
by the ${}^{22}\mathrm{Ne}(\alpha, n){}^{25}\mathrm{Mg}$ reaction during the He-core and C-shell
burning phases of massive stars. This reaction, as well as the competing ${}^{22}\mathrm{Ne}(\alpha,
\gamma){}^{26}\mathrm{Mg}$ reaction, is not well constrained in the important temperature regime
from ${\sim} 0.2$--$0.4$~GK, owing to uncertainties in the nuclear properties of resonances lying
within the Gamow window. To address these uncertainties, we have performed a new measurement of
the ${}^{22}\mathrm{Ne}({}^{6}\mathrm{Li}, d){}^{26}\mathrm{Mg}$ reaction in inverse kinematics,
detecting the outgoing deuterons and ${}^{25,26}\mathrm{Mg}$ recoils in coincidence. We have
established a new $n / \gamma$ decay branching ratio of $1.14(26)$ for the key $E_x = 11.32$ MeV resonance
in $^{26}\mathrm{Mg}$, which results in a new $(\alpha, n)$ strength for this resonance of $42(11)~\mu$eV
when combined with the well-established $(\alpha, \gamma)$ strength of this resonance. We have
also determined new upper limits on the $\alpha$ partial widths of neutron-unbound resonances
at $E_x = 11.112,$ $11.163$, $11.169$, and $11.171$ MeV. Monte-Carlo calculations of the stellar
${}^{22}\mathrm{Ne}(\alpha, n){}^{25}\mathrm{Mg}$ and ${}^{22}\mathrm{Ne}(\alpha, \gamma){}^{26}\mathrm{Mg}$
rates, which incorporate these results, indicate that both rates are substantially lower than
previously thought in the temperature range from ${\sim} 0.2$--$0.4$~GK.
