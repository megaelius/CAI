Wolf-Rayet (WR) galaxies are a rare population of galaxies that host living high-mass stars during
their WR phase (i.e. WR stars) and are thus expected to provide interesting constraints on the stellar
Initial Mass Function, massive star formation, stellar evolution models, etc. Spatially resolved
spectroscopy should in principle provide a more efficient way of identifying WR galaxies than single-fiber
surveys of galactic centers such as SDSS-I & II, as WR stars should be more preferentially found in
discs. Using IFU data from the ongoing SDSS-IV MaNGA survey, we have performed a thorough search
for WR galaxies. We first identify H II regions in each datacube and carry out full spectral fitting
to the stacked spectra. We then visually inspect the residual spectrum of each H II region and identify
WR regions that present a significant "blue bump" at 4600-4750 A. The resulting WR catalog includes
267 WR regions of ~500pc (radius) sizes, distributed in 90 galaxies from the current sample of MaNGA
(MaNGA Product Launch 7). We find WR regions are exclusively found in galaxies that show bluest colors
and highest star formation rates for their mass. Most WR galaxies have late-type morphologies and
show relatively large asymmetry in their images, implying that WR regions are more preferentially
found in interacting/merging galaxies. We estimate the stellar mass function of WR galaxies and
the mass-dependent detection rate. The detection rate of WR galaxies is typically ~2%, with weak
dependence on stellar mass. This detection rate is about 40 times higher than previous studies with
SDSS single fiber data, and by a factor of 2 lower than the CALIFA-based WR catalog. We make comparisons
with SDSS and CALIFA studies, and conclude that different detection rates can be explained mainly
by three factors: spatial coverage, spectral signal-to-noise ratio, and redshift ranges of the
parent sample.
