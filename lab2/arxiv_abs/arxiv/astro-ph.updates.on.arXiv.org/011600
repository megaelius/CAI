Context. The gas kinetic temperature (TK) determines the physical and chemical evolution of the
Interestellar Medium (ISM). However, obtaining reliable TK estimates usually requires expensive
observations including the combination of multi-line analysis and dedicated radiative transfer
calculations. Aims. This work explores the use of HCN and HNC observations, and particularly its
I(HCN)/I(HNC) intensity ratio of their J=1-0 lines, as direct probe of the gas kinetic temperature
in the molecular ISM. Methods. We obtained a new set of large-scale observations of both HCN and HNC
(1-0) lines along the Integral Shape Filament (ISF) in Orion. In combination with ancillary gas
and dust temperature measurements, we find a systematic temperature dependence of the observed
I(HCN)/I(HNC) intensity ratio across our maps. Additional comparisons with chemical models demonstrate
that these observed I(HCN)/I(HNC) variations are driven by the effective destruction and isomerization
mechanisms of HNC under low energy barriers. Results. The observed variations of I(HCN)/I(HNC)
with TK can be described with a two-part linear function. This empirical calibration is then used
to create a temperature map of the entire ISF. Comparisons with similar dust temperature measurements
in this cloud, as well as in other regions and galactic surveys, validate this simple technique to
obtain direct estimates of the gas kinetic temperature in a wide range of physical conditions and
scales with an optimal working range between 15 K and 40 K. Conclusions. Both observations and models
demonstrate the strong sensitivity of the I(HCN)/I(HNC) ratio to the gas kinetic temperature.
Since these lines are easily obtained in observations of local and extragalactic sources, our results
highlight the potential use of this observable as new chemical thermometer for the ISM.
