Context. The variability of Solar Spectral Irradiance over the rotational period and its trend
over the solar activity cycle are important for understanding the Sun-Earth connection as well
as for observational constraints for solar models. Recently the SIM experiment on SORCE has published
an unexpected negative correlation with Total Solar Irradiance of the visible spectral range.
It is compensated by a strong and positive variability of the near UV range. Aims. We aim to verify
whether the anti-correlated SIM/SORCE-trend in the visible can be confirmed by independent observations
of the VIRGO experiment on SOHO. The challenge of all space experiments measuring solar irradiance
are sensitivity changes of their sensors due to exposure to intense UV radiation, which are difficult
to assess in orbit. Methods. We analyze a 10-year time series of VIRGO sun photometer data between
2002 and 2012. The variability of Spectral Solar Irradiance is correlated with the variability
of the Total Solar Irradiance, which is taken as a proxy for solar activity. Results. Observational
evidence indicates that after six years only one single long-term process governs the degradation
of the backup sun photometer in VIRGO which is operated once in a month. This degradation can be well
approximated by a linear function over ten years. The analysis of the residuals from the linear trend
yield robust positive correlations of spectral irradiance at 862, 500 and 402 nm with total irradiance.
In the analysis of annual averages of these data the positive correlations change into weak negative
correlations, but of little statistical significance, for the 862 nm and 402 nm data. At 500 nm the
annual spectral data are still positively correlated with Total Solar Irradiance. The persisting
positive correlation at 500 nm is in contradiction to the SIM/SORCE results.
