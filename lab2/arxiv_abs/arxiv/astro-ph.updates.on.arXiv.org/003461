Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with a plateau phase in their X-ray afterglows obeys a three-dimensional
(3D) relation (Dainotti et al. 2016), between the rest-frame time at the end of the plateau, Ta, its
corresponding X-ray luminosity, La, and the peak luminosity in the prompt emission, Lpeak, an extension
of the two-dimensional Dainotti relation. This 3D relation identifies a GRB fundamental plane
whose existence we here confirm. We extend the original analysis with X-ray data untill July 2016
gathering 183 Swift GRBs with afterglow plateaus and known redshifts. We compare several GRB categories,
such as shorts with extended emission, SEE, X-ray Flashes, GRBs associated with SNe, a sample of
only long-duration GRBs (132), selected from the total sample by excluding GRBs of the previous
categories, and the gold sample, composed by GRBs with light curves with good data coverage and relatively
flat plateaus. The relation planes for each of these categories are not statistically different
from the gold fundamental plane, with the exception of the SEE, which are hence identified as a physically
distinct class of objects. The gold fundamental plane has an intrinsic scatter smaller than any
plane derived from the other sample categories. Thus, the distance of any particular GRB category
from this plane becomes a key parameter. Additionally, we tested this 3D relations by using GRBs
observed at high energy, namely the peak luminosity values derived by the Fermi-Gamma Ray Burst
Monitor (GBM). The 3D relation is also confirmed for GRBs observed by the GBM, thus showing its independence
from the energy range. Furthermore, we computed the several category planes with T*a as a dependent
parameter obtaining for each category smaller intrinsic scatters (reaching a reduction of $24\%$
for the long GRBs). The fundamental plane is independent from several prompt and afterglow parameters.
