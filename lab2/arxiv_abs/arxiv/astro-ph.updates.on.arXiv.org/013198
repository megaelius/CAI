In order to answer some of the major open questions in the fields of supermassive black hole (SMBH)
and galaxy evolution, a complete census of SMBH growth, i.e., active galactic nuclei (AGN), is required.
Thanks to deep all-sky surveys, such as those by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)
and the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) missions, this task is now becoming feasible in the nearby
Universe. Here, we present a new survey, the Local AGN Survey (LASr), with the goal of identifying
AGN unbiased against obscuration and determining the intrinsic Compton-thick (CT) fraction.
First, we construct the most complete all-sky sample of galaxies within 100 Mpc from astronomical
databases (90% completeness for log M_star/M_sun ~9.4), four times deeper than the current local
galaxy reference, the Two Micron All-Sky Survey Redshift Survey (2MRS), which turns out to miss
20% of known luminous AGN. These 49k galaxies serve as parent sample for LASr, called LASr-GPS. It
contains 4.3k already known AGN, >=82% of these are estimated to have L(12um) < 10^42.3 erg/s, i.e.,
are low-luminosity AGN. As a first method for identifying Seyfert-like AGN, we use WISE-based infrared
colours, finding 221 galaxies at L(12um) >= 10^42.3 erg/s to host an AGN at 90% reliability, This
includes 61 new AGN candidates and implies and optical type 2 fraction of 50 to 71%. We quantify the
efficiency of this technique and estimate the total number of AGN with L_int(2-10 keV) >= 10^42 erg/s
in the volume to be 362^+145_-116 (8.6^+3.5_-2.8 10^-5 Mpc^-3). X-ray brightness estimates indicate
the CT fraction to be 40-55% to explain the Swift non-detections of the infrared selected objects.
One third of the AGN within 100 Mpc remain to be identified and we discuss the prospects for the eROSITA
all-sky survey.
