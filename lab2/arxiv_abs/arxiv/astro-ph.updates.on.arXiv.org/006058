We study the impact of different bias and redshift-space models on the halo power spectrum, quantifying
their effect by comparing the fit to a subset of realizations taken from the WizCOLA suite. These
provide simulated power spectrum measurements between $k_{\rm min}$ = 0.03 h/Mpc and $k_{\rm max}$
= 0.29 h/Mpc, constructed using the comoving Lagrangian acceleration method. For the bias prescription
we include (i) simple linear bias; (ii) the McDonald & Roy model and (iii) its coevolution variant
introduced by Saito et al.; and (iv) a very general model including all terms up to one-loop and corrections
from advection. For the redshift-space modelling we include the Kaiser formula with exponential
damping and the power spectrum provided by (i) tree-level perturbation theory and (ii) the Halofit
prescription; (iii) one-loop perturbation theory, also with exponential damping; and (iv) an
effective field theory description, also at one-loop, with damping represented by the EFT subtractions.
We quantify the improvement from each layer of modelling by measuring the typical improvement in
chi-square when fitting to a member of the simulation suite. We attempt to detect overfitting by
testing for compatibility between the best-fit power spectrum per realization and the best-fit
over the entire WizCOLA suite. For both bias and the redshift-space map we find that increasingly
permissive models yield improvements in chi-square but with diminishing returns. The most permissive
models show modest evidence for overfitting. Accounting for model complexity using the Bayesian
Information Criterion, we argue that standard perturbation theory up to one-loop, or a related
model such as that of Taruya, Nishimichi & Saito, coupled to the coevolution bias model, is likely
to provide a good compromise for near-future galaxy surveys operating with comparable $k_{\rm
max}$.
