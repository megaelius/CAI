We present the survey strategy and early results of the "Satellites Around Galactic Analogs" (SAGA)
Survey. The SAGA Survey's goal is to measure the distribution of satellite galaxies around 100 systems
analogous to the Milky Way down to the luminosity of the Leo I dwarf galaxy ($ M_r < -12.3 $). We define
a Milky Way analog based on $K$-band luminosity and local environment. Here, we present satellite
luminosity functions for 8 Milky Way analog galaxies between 20 to 40 Mpc. These systems have nearly
complete spectroscopic coverage of candidate satellites within the projected host virial radius
down to $ r_o < 20.75 $ using low redshift $gri$ color criteria. We have discovered a total of 25 new
satellite galaxies: 14 new satellite galaxies meet our formal criteria around our complete host
systems, plus 11 additional satellites in either incompletely surveyed hosts or below our formal
magnitude limit. Combined with 13 previously known satellites, there are a total of 27 satellites
around 8 complete Milky Way analog hosts. We find a wide distribution in the number of satellites
per host, from 1 to 9, in the luminosity range for which there are five Milky Way satellites. Standard
abundance matching extrapolated from higher luminosities predicts less scatter between hosts
and a steeper luminosity function slope than observed. We find that the majority of satellites (26
of 27) are star-forming. These early results indicate that the Milky Way has a different satellite
population than typical in our sample, potentially changing the physical interpretation of measurements
based only on the Milky Way's satellite galaxies.
