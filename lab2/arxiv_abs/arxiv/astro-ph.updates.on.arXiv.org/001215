Population III stars are believed to have been more massive than typical stars today and to have formed
in relative isolation. The thermodynamic impact of metals is expected to induce a transition leading
to clustered, low-mass Population II star formation. In this work, we present results from three
cosmological simulations, only differing in gas metallicity, that focus on the impact of metal
fine-structure line cooling on the formation of stellar clusters in a high-redshift atomic cooling
halo. Introduction of sink particles allows us to follow the process of gas hydrodynamics and accretion
onto cluster stars for 4 Myr corresponding to multiple local free-fall times. At metallicities
at least $10^{-3}\, Z_{\odot}$, gas is able to reach the CMB temperature floor and fragment pervasively
resulting in a stellar cluster of size $\sim1$ pc and total mass $\sim1000\, M_{\odot}$. The masses
of individual sink particles vary, but are typically $\sim100\, M_{\odot}$, consistent with the
Jeans mass when gas cools to the CMB temperature, though some solar mass fragments are also produced.
At the low metallicity of $10^{-4}\, Z_{\odot}$, fragmentation is completely suppressed on scales
greater than 0.01 pc and total stellar mass is lower by a factor of 3 than in the higher metallicity
simulations. The sink particle accretion rates, and thus their masses, are determined by the mass
of the gravitationally unstable gas cloud and the prolonged gas accretion over many Myr. The simulations
thus exhibit features of both monolithic collapse and competitive accretion. Even considering
possible dust induced fragmentation that would occur at higher densities, the formation of a bona
fide stellar cluster seems to require metal line cooling and metallicities of at least $10^{-3}\,
Z_{\odot}$.
