We show, by comparing observations with theoretical models, that the observed Kuiper Belt size
distribution is well matched by coagulation models, which start from an initial planetesimal population
with radii of about 1km, and subsequent collisional evolution. We find that the observed size distribution
for R > 30km has not been modified by collisional evolution over the age of the solar system, and
that the size distribution below R ~ 30km has been modified by collisions and that its slope is well
matched by collisional evolution models that use published strength laws. We investigate in detail
the resulting size distribution of bodies ranging from 0.01km to 30km and find that its slope changes
several times as a function of radius before approaching the expected value for an equilibrium collisional
cascade of material strength dominated bodies for R < 0.1km. Compared to a single power law size
distribution that would span the whole range from 0.01km to 30km, we find a strong deficit of bodies
around R ~10km and a strong excess of bodies around 2km. This deficit and excess are caused by an excess
mass in small planetesimals in the km size range that was left over from the runaway growth phase and
that leaves a signature in the size distribution that is not erased after 4.5 Gyrs of collisional
evolution. Observations of the small KBO size distribution can therefore test if large KBOs grew
as a result of runaway growth and constrain the initial planetesimal sizes. We find that results
from recent KBO occultation surveys and the observed KBO size distribution can be best matched by
an initial planetesimal population that contained about equal mass per logarithmic mass bin in
bodies ranging from 0.4km to 4km in radius. In addition, we find that we cannot match the observed
KBO size distribution if most of the planetesimal mass was contained in bodies that were 10km in radius
or larger.
