Many of the fundamental physical constants in Physics, as a discipline, are measured to exquisite
levels of precision. The fundamental constants that define Cosmology, however, are largely determined
via a handful of independent techniques that are applied to even fewer datasets. The history of the
measurement of the Hubble Constant (H0), which serves to anchor the expansion history of the Universe
to its current value, is an exemplar of the difficulties of cosmological measurement; indeed, as
we approach the centennial of its first measurement, the quest for H0 still consumes a great number
of resources. In this white paper, we demonstrate how the approaching era of Extremely Large Telescopes
(ELTs) will transform the astrophysical measure of H0 from the limited and few into a fundamentally
new regime where (i) multiple, independent techniques are employed with modest use of large aperture
facilities and (ii) 1% or better precision is readily attainable. This quantum leap in how we approach
H0 is due to the unparalleled sensitivity and spatial resolution of ELT's and the ability to use integral
field observations for simultaneous spectroscopy and photometry, which together permit both
familiar and new techniques to effectively by-pass the conventional 'ladder' framework to minimize
total uncertainty. Three independent techniques are discussed -- (i) standard candles via a two-step
distance ladder applied to metal, poor stellar populations, (ii) standard clocks via gravitational
lens cosmography, and (iii) standard sirens via gravitational wave sources -- each of which can
reach 1% with relatively modest investment from 30-m class facilities.
