We study the chemistry of small hydrocarbons in the photon-dominated regions (PDRs) associated
with the ultra-compact HII region Mon R2. Our goal is to determine the variations of the abundance
of small hydrocarbons in a high-UV irradiated PDR and investigate their chemistry. We present an
observational study of CH, CCH and c-C$_3$H$_2$ in Mon R2 combining data obtained with the IRAM 30m
telescope and Herschel. We determine the column densities of these species, and compare their spatial
distributions with that of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). We compare the observational
results with different chemical models to explore the relative importance of gas-phase, grain-surface
and time-dependent chemistry in these environments. The emission of the small hydrocarbons show
different patterns. The CCH emission is extended while CH and c-C$_3$H$_2$ are concentrated towards
the more illuminated layers of the PDR. The ratio of the column densities of c-C$_3$H$_2$ and CCH
shows spatial variations up to a factor of a few, increasing from $N(c-C$_3$H$_2$)/N(CCH)\approx0.004$
in the envelope to a maximum of $\sim0.015-0.029$ towards the 8$\mu$m emission peak. Comparing
these results with other galactic PDRs, we find that the abundance of CCH is quite constant over a
wide range of G$_0$, whereas the abundance of c-C$_3$H$_2$ is higher in low-UV PDRs. In Mon R2, the
gas-phase steady-state chemistry can account relatively well for the abundances of CH and CCH in
the most exposed layers of the PDR, but falls short by a factor of 10 to reproduce c-C$_3$H$_2$. In
the molecular envelope, time-dependent effects and grain surface chemistry play a dominant role
in determining the hydrocarbons abundances. Our study shows that CCH and c-C$_3$H$_2$ present
a complex chemistry in which UV photons, grain-surface chemistry and time dependent effects contribute
to determine their abundances.
