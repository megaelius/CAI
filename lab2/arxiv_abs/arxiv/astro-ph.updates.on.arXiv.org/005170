We elaborate on the paradigm proposed in Ferreira et al. (2006). For $\mu>0.1$, the accretion flow
produces jets that vertically, carry away the disk angular momentum (Jet Emitting Disk or JED).
The goal of this paper is to investigate the spectral signatures of the JED configurations. We have
developed a two-temperature plasma code that computes the disk local thermal equilibria, taking
into account the advection of energy in an iterative way. Our code addresses optically thin/thick
transitions, both radiation and gas supported regimes and computes in a consistent way the emitted
spectrum from a steady-state disk. The optically thin emission is obtained using the BELM code,
which provides accurate spectra for Bremsstrahlung and Synchrotron emission processes as well
as for their local Comptonisation. For a range in radius and accretion rates, JEDs exhibit three
thermal equilibria, one thermally unstable and two stable. Due to the existence of two thermally
stable solutions, an hysteresis cycle is naturally obtained. However, standard outbursting X-ray
binary cycles cannot be reproduced. Another striking feature of JEDs is their ability to reproduce
luminous Hard States. At high accretion rates JEDs become slim, where the main cooling is advection.
When the loss of angular momentum and power in jets is then consistently taken into account, accretion
disks have spectral signatures that are consistent with Hard states, up to large luminosities.
The reproduction of Soft states being well performed by Standard Accretion Disks (SAD), this study
advocates for the existence of hybrid disk configuration: JED and SAD. A study of such hybrid configuration
will be presented in a forthcoming paper III.
