Future surveys will access large volumes of space and hence very long wavelength fluctuations of
the matter density and gravitational field. It has been argued that the set of secondary effects
that affect the galaxy distribution, relativistic in nature, will bring new, complementary cosmological
constraints. We study this claim in detail by focusing on a subset of wide-area future surveys: Stage-4
cosmic microwave background experiments and photometric redshift surveys. In particular, we
look at the magnification lensing contribution to galaxy clustering and general relativistic
corrections to all observables. We quantify the amount of information encoded in these effects
in terms of the tightening of the final cosmological constraints as well as the potential bias in
inferred parameters associated with neglecting them. We do so for a wide range of cosmological parameters,
covering neutrino masses, standard dark-energy parametrizations and scalar-tensor gravity
theories. Our results show that, while the effect of lensing magnification to number counts does
not contain a significant amount of information when galaxy clustering is combined with cosmic
shear measurements, this contribution does play a significant role in biasing estimates on a host
of parameter families if unaccounted for. Since the amplitude of the magnification term is controlled
by the slope of the source number counts with apparent magnitude, $s(z)$, we also estimate the accuracy
to which this quantity must be known to avoid systematic parameter biases, finding that future surveys
will need to determine $s(z)$ to the $\sim$5-10\% level. On the contrary, large-scale general-relativistic
corrections are irrelevant both in terms of information content and parameter bias for most cosmological
parameters, but significant for the level of primordial non-Gaussianity.
