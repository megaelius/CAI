Interpreting the small-scale clustering of galaxies with halo models can elucidate the connection
between galaxies and dark matter halos. Unfortunately, the modelling is typically not sufficiently
accurate for ruling out models statistically. It is thus difficult to use the information encoded
in small scales to test cosmological models or probe subtle features of the galaxy-halo connection.
In this paper, we attempt to push halo modelling into the "accurate" regime with a fully numerical
mock-based methodology and careful treatment of statistical and systematic errors. With our forward-modelling
approach, we can incorporate clustering statistics beyond the traditional two-point statistics.
We use this modelling methodology to test the standard $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ + halo model against
the clustering of SDSS DR7 galaxies. Specifically, we use the projected correlation function,
group multiplicity function and galaxy number density as constraints. We find that while the model
fits each statistic separately, it struggles to fit them simultaneously. Adding group statistics
leads to a more stringent test of the model and significantly tighter constraints on model parameters.
We explore the impact of varying the adopted halo definition and cosmological model and find that
changing the cosmology makes a significant difference. The most successful model we tried (Planck
cosmology with Mvir halos) matches the clustering of low luminosity galaxies, but exhibits a 2.3$\sigma$
tension with the clustering of luminous galaxies, thus providing evidence that the "standard"
halo model needs to be extended. This work opens the door to adding interesting freedom to the halo
model and including additional clustering statistics as constraints.
