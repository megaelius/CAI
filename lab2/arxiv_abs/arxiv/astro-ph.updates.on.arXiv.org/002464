Polarized emission observed by Planck HFI at 353 GHz towards a sample of nearby fields is presented,
focusing on the statistics of polarization fractions $p$ and angles $\psi$. The polarization fractions
and column densities in these nearby fields are representative of the range of values obtained over
the whole sky. We find that: (i) the largest polarization fractions are reached in the most diffuse
fields; (ii) the maximum polarization fraction $p_\mathrm{max}$ decreases with column density
$N_\mathrm{H}$ in the more opaque fields with $N_\mathrm{H} > 10^{21}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$;
and (iii) the polarization fraction along a given line of sight is correlated with the local spatial
coherence of the polarization angle. These observations are compared to polarized emission maps
computed in simulations of anisotropic magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence in which we assume
a uniform intrinsic polarization fraction of the dust grains. We find that an estimate of this parameter
may be recovered from the maximum polarization fraction $p_\mathrm{max}$ in diffuse regions where
the magnetic field is ordered on large scales and perpendicular to the line of sight. This emphasizes
the impact of anisotropies of the magnetic field on the emerging polarization signal. The decrease
of the polarization fraction with column density in nearby molecular clouds is well reproduced
in the simulations, indicating that it is essentially due to the turbulent structure of the magnetic
field: an accumulation of variously polarized structures along the line of sight leads to such an
anti-correlation. In the simulations, polarization fractions are also found to anti-correlate
with the angle dispersion function $\mathcal{S}$. [abridged]
