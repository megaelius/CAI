The eccentric shape of the debris disk observed around Fomalhaut was first attributed to Fom b, a
companion detected near the belt inner-edge, but new constraints on its orbit revealed that it is
belt-crossing, highly eccentric $(e \sim 0.6-0.9)$, and can hardly account for the shape of the
belt. The best scenario to explain this paradox is that there is another massive body in this system,
Fom c, which drives the debris disk shape. The resulting planetary system is highly unstable, which
hints at a dynamical scenario involving a recent scattering of Fom b on its current orbit, potentially
with the putative Fom c. Our goal is to give insights on the probability for Fom b to have been set on
its highly eccentric orbit by a close-encounter with the putative Fom c. We aim to study in particular
the part played by mean-motion resonances with Fom c, which could have brought Fom b sufficiently
close to Fom c for it to be scattered on its current orbit, but also delay this scattering event. Using
N-body simulations, we found that the generation of orbits similar to that of Fom b, either in term
of dimensions or orientation, is a robust process involving a scattering event and a further secular
evolution of inner material with an eccentric massive body such as the putative Fom c. We found in
particular that mean-motion resonances can delay scattering events, and thus the production of
Fom b-like orbits, on timescales comparable to the age of the system, thus explaining the witnessing
of an unstable configuration. We conclude that Fom b probably originated from an inner resonance
with Fom c, which is at least Neptune-Saturn size, and was set on its current orbit by a scattering
event with Fom c. Since Fom b could not have formed from material in resonance, our scenario also hints
at former migration processes in this planetary system.
