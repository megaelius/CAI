Multi-hydrogenated species with proper symmetry properties can present different spin configurations,
and thus exist under different spin symmetry forms, labeled as para and ortho for two-hydrogen molecules.
We investigated here the ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) of H$_2$Cl$^+$ in the light of new observations
performed in the z=0.89 absorber toward the lensed quasar PKS 1830-211 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA). Two independent lines of sight were observed, to the southwest (SW) and northeast
(NE) images of the quasar, with OPR values found to be $3.15 \pm 0.13$ and $3.1 \pm 0.5$ in each region,
respectively, in agreement with a spin statistical weight of 3:1. An OPR of 3:1 for a molecule containing
two identical hydrogen nuclei can refer to either a statistical result or a high-temperature limit
depending on the reaction mechanism leading to its formation. It is thus crucial to identify rigorously
how OPRs are produced in order to constrain the information that these probes can provide. To understand
the production of the H$_2$Cl$^+$ OPR, we undertook a careful theoretical study of the reaction
mechanisms involved with the aid of quasi-classical trajectory calculations on a new global potential
energy surface fit to a large number of high-level ab initio data. Our study shows that the major formation
reaction for H$_2$Cl$^+$ produces this ion via a hydrogen abstraction rather than a scrambling
mechanism. Such a mechanism leads to a 3:1 OPR, which is not changed by destruction and possible thermalization
reactions for H$_2$Cl$^+$ and is thus likely to be the cause of observed 3:1 OPR ratios, contrary
to the normal assumption of scrambling.
