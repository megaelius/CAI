Radio observations of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star envelopes frequently show some excess
emission at frequencies below 100 GHz which cannot be explained by thermal dust emission (hereafter
anomalous microwave emission-AME). Moreover, AGB envelopes are a common place where gas molecules
condense to form nanoparticles (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and large grains. In
this paper, we will study whether electric dipole emission from rapidly spinning nanoparticles
can reproduce the AME observed toward AGB stars. To properly model the size distribution of nanoparticles
in the AGB envelope, we take into account both the increase of nanoparticles due to rotational disruption
of large grains spun-up by radiative torques and the decrease of smallest nanoparticles due to rotational
disruption driven by stochastic gas collisions. We then perform detailed modeling of microwave
emission from rapidly spinning nanoparticles from both C-rich and O-rich AGB envelopes using the
grain size distribution constrained by rotational disruption. We find that spinning dust emission
is dominant over thermal dust emission at frequencies below 100 GHz. We attempt to fit the observational
data of AME using our spinning dust model and demonstrate that spinning dust can reproduce the observed
AME in six AGB stars. Finally, we discuss that microwave emission from spinning dust in AGB envelopes
could be observed with high-resolution upcoming radio telescopes such as ngVLA and ALMA Band 1.
This would be a major leap for understanding AGB envelopes, formation, evolution, and internal
structures of dust. Observations would help to distinguish the carrier of AME from comparing C-rich
to O-rich stars, because PAHs are formed in C-rich AGB stars while silicates are formed in O-rich
stars.
