Correlations measured in 3D in the Lyman-alpha forest are contaminated by the presence of the damping
wings of high column density (HCD) absorbing systems of neutral hydrogen (HI; having column densities
$N(\mathrm{HI}) > 1.6 \times 10^{17}\,\mathrm{atoms}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$), which extend significantly
beyond the redshift-space location of the absorber. We measure this effect as a function of the column
density of the HCD absorbers and redshift by measuring 3D flux power spectra in cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations from the Illustris project. Survey pipelines exclude regions containing the largest
damping wings. We find that, even after this procedure, there is a scale-dependent correction to
the 3D Lyman-alpha forest flux power spectrum from residual contamination. We model this residual
using a simple physical model of the HCD absorbers as linearly biased tracers of the matter density
distribution, convolved with their Voigt profiles and integrated over the column density distribution
function. We recommend the use of this model over existing models used in data analysis, which approximate
the damping wings as top-hats and so miss shape information in the extended wings. The simple linear
Voigt model is statistically consistent with our simulation results for a mock residual contamination
up to small scales ($k < 1\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), even though it cannot account for the effect
of the highest column density absorbers (which are in any case preferentially removed from survey
data) on the smallest scales (e.g., $k > 0.4\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for small DLAs; $N(\mathrm{HI})
\sim 10^{21}\,\mathrm{atoms}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$). Our model is appropriate for an accurate
analysis of the baryon acoustic oscillations feature and it is additionally essential for reconstructing
the full shape of the 3D flux power spectrum, assuming that the highest column density absorbers
are removed.
