Recently, high angular resolution imaging instruments such as SPHERE and GPI have discovered many
spiral-arm-like features in near-infrared scattered light images of protoplanetary disks. Theory
and simulations have suggested that these arms are most likely excited by planets forming in the
disks; however, a quantitative relation between the arm-to-disk brightness contrast and planet
mass is still missing. Using 3D hydrodynamics and radiative transfer simulations, we examine the
morphology and contrast of planet-induced arms in disks. We find a power-law relation for the face-on
arm contrast ($\delta_{\rm max}$) as a function of planet mass ($M_{\rm p}$) and disk aspect ratio
($h/r$): $\delta_{\rm max}\approx((M_{\rm p}/M_{\rm J})/(h/r)^{1.38})^{0.22}$. With current
observational capability, at a 30 AU separation, the minimum planet mass for driving detectable
arms in a disk around a 1 Myr 1$M_\odot$ star at 140 pc at low inclinations is around Saturn mass. For
planets more massive than Neptune masses, they typically drive multiple arms. Therefore in observed
disks with spirals, it is unlikely that each spiral arm originates from a different planet. We also
find only massive perturbers with at least multi-Jupiter masses are capable of driving bright arms
with $\delta_{\rm max}\gtrsim2$ as found in SAO 206462, MWC 758, and LkH$\alpha$~330, and these
arms do not follow linear wave propagation theory. Additionally, we find the morphology and contrast
of the primary and secondary arms are largely unaffected by a modest level of viscosity with $\alpha\lesssim0.01$.
Finally, the contrast of the arms in the SAO 206462 disk suggests that the perturber SAO 206462 b at
$\sim100$ AU is about $5-10M_{\rm J}$ in mass.
