Cosmic rays in galaxy clusters are unique probes of energetic processes operating with large-scale
structures in the Universe. Precise measurements of cosmic rays in galaxy clusters are essential
for improving our understanding of non-thermal components in the intracluster-medium (ICM) as
well as the accuracy of cluster mass estimates in cosmological analyses. In this paper, we perform
a cross-correlation analysis with the extragalactic gamma-ray background and the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
(tSZ) effect in the cosmic microwave background. The expected cross-correlation signal would
contain rich information about the cosmic-ray-induced gamma-ray emission in the most massive
galaxy clusters at $z\sim0.1-0.2$. We analyze the gamma-ray background map with 8 years of data
taken by the Large Area Telescope onboard Fermi satellite and the publicly available tSZ map by Planck.
We confirm that the measured cross-correlation is consistent with a null detection, and thus it
enables us to put the tightest constraint on the acceleration efficiency of cosmic ray protons at
shocks in and around galaxy clusters. We find the acceleration efficiency must be below 5\% with
a $2\sigma$ confidence level when the hydrostatic mass bias of clusters is assumed to be 30\%, and
our result is not significantly affected by the assumed value of the hydrostatic mass bias. Our constraint
implies that the non-thermal cosmic-ray pressure in the ICM can introduce only a $\le 3\%$ level
of the hydrostatic mass bias, highlighting that cosmic rays alone do not account for the mass bias
inferred by the Planck analyses. Finally, we discuss future detectability prospects of cosmic-ray-induced
gamma rays from the Perseus cluster for the Cherenkov Telescope Array.
