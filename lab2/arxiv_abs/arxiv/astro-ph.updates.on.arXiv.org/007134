The scatter of the spatially resolved star formation main sequence (SFMS) is investigated in order
to reveal signatures about the processes of galaxy formation and evolution. We have assembled a
sample of 355 nearby galaxies with spatially resolved H{\alpha} and mid-infrared fluxes from the
Survey for Ionized Neutral Gas in Galaxies and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, respectively.
We examine the impact of various star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass transformations on the
SFMS. Ranging from 10^6 to 10^11.5 M_sun and derived from color to mass-to-light ratio methods for
mid-infrared bands, the stellar masses are internally consistent within their range of applicability
and inherent systematic errors; a constant mass-to-light ratio also yields representative stellar
masses. The various SFR estimates show intrinsic differences and produce noticeable vertical
shifts in the SFMS, depending on the timescales and physics encompassed by the corresponding tracer.
SFR estimates appear to break down on physical scales below 500 pc. We also examine the various sources
of scatter in the spatially resolved SFMS and find morphology does not play a significant role. We
identify three unique tracks across the SFMS by individual galaxies, delineated by a critical stellar
mass density of log (\Sigma_M*)~7.5. Below this scale, the SFMS shows no clear trend and is likely
driven by local, stochastic internal processes. Above this scale, all spatially resolved galaxies
have comparable SFMS slopes but exhibit two different behaviors, resulting likely from the rate
of mass accretion at the center of the galaxy.
