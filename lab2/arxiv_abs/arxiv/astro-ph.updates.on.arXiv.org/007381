At redshifts below $z=2$, the majority of supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass estimates are obtained
from modeling stellar kinematics or the dynamics of ionized molecular gas in the vicinity of the
galaxy nucleus. For large early type galaxies, there appears to be a systematic disagreement between
these two methods: stellar kinematics models predict higher masses than gas-dynamical models
--- an explicit example of which is M87, in which the discrepancy is a factor of two, more than 2 $\sigma$.
Critical to the latter is the assumed underlying dynamical state of the gas; typically assumed to
be on circular Keplerian orbits, potentially with some additional turbulent pressure support.
This is inconsistent with models of the gas flow about low-accretion-rate SMBHs and at odds with
observations of the Galactic Center. Thus, we present a simple model of non-Keplerian molecular
disks and explore their implications for SMBH mass measurements. Specifically, we show that a larger
central black hole with gas experiencing small amounts of radial motion can produce velocity curves
similar to models that just contain circular Keplerian motions and a lower black hole mass. However,
these non-Keplerian models are distinguishable from low-mass Keplerian models primarily through
measurements of the velocity dispersion, wherein non-Keplerian models produce higher and narrower
peak dispersions. Away from the galaxy center, but still within the circumnuclear gas disk, non-Keplerian
models also become distinguishable from Keplerian models via a shift in the center of the velocity
curve, related to the magnitude of the radial motion. The velocity model presented in this paper
is capable of resolving the discrepancy between the ionized gas dynamics and stellar kinematics
mass estimates, and is applicable to gas dynamical mass estimates of SMBHs in general.
