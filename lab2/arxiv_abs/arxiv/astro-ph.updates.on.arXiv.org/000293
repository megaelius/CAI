We present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as a function of redshift
for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the Planck SZ (PSZ) catalogue. The PSZ is selected through
the signature of the Sunyaev--Zeldovich (SZ) effect, and the sub-sample used here has a signal-to-noise
threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster and all but one with a redshift estimate.
We discuss the calculation of the expected cluster counts as a function of cosmological parameters,
the completeness of the sample, and the likelihood construction method. Using a relation between
mass M and SZ signal Y based on comparison to X-ray measurements, we derive constraints on the power
spectrum amplitude sigma_8 and matter density parameter \Omega_m in a flat LCDM model. We test the
robustness of our estimates and find that possible biases in the Y-M relation and the halo mass function
appear larger than the statistical uncertainties from the cluster sample. Assuming a bias between
the X-ray determined mass and the true mass of 20%, motivated by comparison of the observed mass scaling
relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we find that sigma_8(Omega_m/0.27)^0.3=0.78+-0.01,
with one-dimensional ranges sigma_8=0.77+-0.02 and Omega_m=0.29+-0.02. The values of the cosmological
parameters are degenerate with the mass bias, and it is found that the larger values of sigma_8 and
Omega_m preferred by the Planck's measurements of the primary CMB anisotropies can be accommodated
by a mass bias of about 45%. Alternatively, consistency with the primary CMB constraints can be achieved
by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scales, such as a component of massive neutrinos.
We place our results in the context of other determinations of cosmological parameters, and discuss
issues that need to be resolved in order to make progress in this field.
