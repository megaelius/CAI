Studying the internal processes of individual galaxies at kilo-parsec scales is crucial in enhancing
our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution processes. In this work, we investigate the
distribution of star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (sSFR), and dust attenuation across individual
galaxies for a sample of 32 galaxies selected from the MUSE-Wide Survey at 0.1 $< \textit{z} <$ 0.42
with a dynamic range in stellar masses between $10^{7.7}$ and $10^{10.3}$ M$_{\odot}$. We take
advantage of the high spatial resolution of the MUSE integral-field spectrograph and measure reliable
spatially resolved H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission line maps for individual galaxies. We also
derive resolved stellar mass, SFR and dust maps using pixel-by-pixel SED fitting on high resolution
multi-band HST/ACS and HST/WFC3 data from the CANDELS survey. By combining these, we analyze the
radial profile of various physical parameters across these galaxies. We observe a radial dependence
in both stellar and nebular color excess profiles peaking at the inner regions of galaxies. We also
find the color excess profiles to most strongly correlate with the integrated sSFRs of galaxies.
The median sSFR$_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}$ radial profiles of galaxies in our sample show a 0.8 dex increase
from the central regions outward. This increase compared to the almost flat median radial profile
of sSFR$_{\mathrm{SED}}$, which traces longer timescales of star formation, is in favor of the
inside-out quenching of star formation. We bring further evidence for this quenching scenario
from the locus of different subregions of galaxies on the SFR-M$_{*}$ and sSFR-M$_{*}$ relations.
