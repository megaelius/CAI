In this third paper of the MOVES (Multiwavelength Observations of an eVaporating Exoplanet and
its Star) programme, we combine Hubble Space Telescope far-ultraviolet observations with XMM-Newton/Swift
X-ray observations to measure the emission of HD 189733 in various FUV lines, and its soft X-ray spectrum.
Based on these measurements we characterise the interstellar medium toward HD 189733 and derive
semi-synthetic XUV spectra of the star, which are used to study the evolution of its high-energy
emission at five different epochs. Two flares from HD 189733 are observed, but we propose that the
long-term variations in its spectral energy distribution have the most important consequences
for the environment of HD 189733b. Reduced coronal and wind activity could favour the formation
of a dense population of Si$^{2+}$ atoms in a bow-shock ahead of the planet, responsible for pre-
and in-transit absorption measured in the first two epochs. In-transit absorption signatures
are detected in the Lyman-$\alpha$ line in the second, third and fifth epochs, which could arise
from the extended planetary thermosphere and a tail of stellar wind protons neutralised via charge-exchange
with the planetary exosphere. We propose that increases in the X-ray irradiation of the planet,
and decreases in its EUV irradiation causing lower photoionisation rates of neutral hydrogen,
favour the detection of these signatures by sustaining larger densities of H$^{0}$ atoms in the
upper atmosphere and boosting charge-exchanges with the stellar wind. Deeper and broader absorption
signatures in the last epoch suggest that the planet entered a different evaporation regime, providing
clues as to the link between stellar activity and the structure of the planetary environment.
