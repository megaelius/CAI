A planet's atmospheric constituents (e.g., O$_2$, O$_3$, H$_2$O$_v$, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, N$_2$O)
can provide clues to its surface habitability, and may offer biosignature targets for remote life
detection efforts. The plethora of rocky exoplanets found by recent transit surveys (e.g., the
Kepler mission) indicates that potentially habitable systems orbiting K- and M-dwarf stars may
have very different orbital and atmospheric characteristics than Earth. To assess the physical
distribution and observational prospects of various biosignatures and habitability indicators,
it is important to understand how they may change under different astrophysical and geophysical
configurations, and to simulate these changes with models that include feedbacks between different
subsystems of a planet's climate. Here we use a three-dimensional (3D) Chemistry-Climate model
(CCM) to study the effects of changes in stellar spectral energy distribution (SED), stellar activity,
and planetary rotation on Earth-analogs and tidally-locked planets. Our simulations show that,
apart from shifts in stellar SEDs and UV radiation, changes in illumination geometry and rotation-induced
circulation can influence the global distribution of atmospheric biosignatures. We find that
the stratospheric day-to-night side mixing ratio differences on tidally-locked planets remain
low ($<20\%$) across the majority of the canonical biosignatures. Interestingly however, secondary
photosynthetic biosignatures (e.g., C$_2$H$_6$S) show much greater (${\sim}67\%$) day-to-night
side differences, and point to regimes in which tidal-locking could have observationally distinguishable
effects on phase curve, transit, and secondary eclipse measurements. Overall, this work highlights
the potential and promise for 3D CCMs to study the atmospheric properties and habitability of terrestrial
worlds.
