We present a high-resolution ($\sim0.''12$, $\sim16$ au, mean sensitivity of $50~\mu$Jy~beam$^{-1}$
at 225 GHz) snapshot survey of 32 protoplanetary disks around young stars with spectral type earlier
than M3 in the Taurus star-forming region using Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). This sample
includes most mid-infrared excess members that were not previously imaged at high spatial resolution,
excluding close binaries and highly extincted objects, thereby providing a more representative
look at disk properties at 1--2 Myr. Our 1.3 mm continuum maps reveal 12 disks with prominent dust
gaps and rings, 2 of which are around primary stars in wide binaries, and 20 disks with no resolved
features at the observed resolution (hereafter smooth disks), 8 of which are around the primary
star in wide binaries. The smooth disks were classified based on their lack of resolved substructures,
but their most prominent property is that they are all compact with small effective emission radii
($R_{\rm eff,95\%} \lesssim 50$ au). In contrast, all disks with $R_{\rm eff,95\%}$ of at least
55 au in our sample show detectable substructures. Nevertheless, their inner emission cores (inside
the resolved gaps) have similar peak brightness, power law profiles, and transition radii to the
compact smooth disks, so the primary difference between these two categories is the lack of outer
substructures in the latter. These compact disks may lose their outer disk through fast radial drift
without dust trapping, or they might be born with small sizes. The compact dust disks, as well as the
inner disk cores of extended ring disks, that look smooth at the current resolution will likely show
small-scale or low-contrast substructures at higher resolution. The correlation between disk
size and disk luminosity correlation demonstrates that some of the compact disks are optically
thick at millimeter wavelengths.
