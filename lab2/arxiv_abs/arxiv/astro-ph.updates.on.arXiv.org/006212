The symbiotic star R Aqr is part of a small sample of binary AGB stars observed with ALMA. The sample
stars are: R Aqr, Mira, W Aql, and pi1 Gru. The sample covers a range in binary separation and wind properties,
where R Aqr is the source with the smallest separation. The R Aqr binary pair consists of an M-type
AGB star and a white dwarf at a separation of 45 mas, equivalent to about 10 AU at 218 pc. The aim of the
ALMA study is to investigate the dependence of the wind shaping on the binary separation and to provide
constraints for hydrodynamical binary interaction models. R Aqr is particularly interesting
as the source with the smallest separation and a complex circumstellar environment that is strongly
affected by the interaction between the two stars and by the high-energy radiation resulting from
this interaction and from the hot white dwarf companion. The CO(J=3-2) line emission has been observed
at 0.5" spatial resolution. The CO envelope around the binary pair is marginally resolved, showing
what appears to be a rather complex distribution. The outer radius of the CO emitting region is estimated
from the data and found to be about a factor of 10 larger than previously thought. This implies an average
mass-loss rate during the past 100 yr of 2x10-7 Msun/yr, a factor of 45 less than previous estimates.
The channel maps are presented and the molecular gas distribution is discussed and set into the context
of what was previously known about the system. Additional molecular line emission detected within
the bandwidth covered by the ALMA observations is also presented. Because of the limited extent
of the emission, firm conclusions about the dynamical evolution of the system will have to wait for
higher spatial resolution observations. However, the data presented here support the assumption
that the mass-loss rate from the Mira star strongly varies and is focused on the orbital plane.
