The data volume generated by astronomical surveys is growing rapidly. Traditional analysis techniques
in spectroscopy either demand intensive human interaction or are computationally expensive.
In this scenario, machine learning, and unsupervised clustering algorithms in particular offer
interesting alternatives. The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE)
offers a vast data set of near-infrared stellar spectra which is perfect for testing such alternatives.
Apply an unsupervised classification scheme based on $K$-means to the massive APOGEE data set.
Explore whether the data are amenable to classification into discrete classes. We apply the $K$-means
algorithm to 153,847 high resolution spectra ($R\approx22,500$). We discuss the main virtues
and weaknesses of the algorithm, as well as our choice of parameters. We show that a classification
based on normalised spectra captures the variations in stellar atmospheric parameters, chemical
abundances, and rotational velocity, among other factors. The algorithm is able to separate the
bulge and halo populations, and distinguish dwarfs, sub-giants, RC and RGB stars. However, a discrete
classification in flux space does not result in a neat organisation in the parameters space. Furthermore,
the lack of obvious groups in flux space causes the results to be fairly sensitive to the initialisation,
and disrupts the efficiency of commonly-used methods to select the optimal number of clusters.
Our classification is publicly available, including extensive online material associated with
the APOGEE Data Release 12 (DR12). Our description of the APOGEE database can enormously help with
the identification of specific types of targets for various applications. We find a lack of obvious
groups in flux space, and identify limitations of the $K$-means algorithm in dealing with this kind
of data.
