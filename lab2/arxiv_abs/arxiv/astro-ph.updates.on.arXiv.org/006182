Parameter estimation in HEP experiments often involves Monte-Carlo simulation to model the experimental
response function. A typical application are forward-folding likelihood analyses with re-weighting,
or time-consuming minimization schemes with a new simulation set for each parameter value. Problematically,
the finite size of such Monte Carlo samples carries intrinsic uncertainty that can lead to a substantial
bias in parameter estimation if it is neglected and the sample size is small. We introduce a probabilistic
treatment of this problem by replacing the usual likelihood functions with novel generalized probability
distributions that incorporate the finite statistics via suitable marginalization. These new
PDFs are analytic, and can be used to replace the Poisson, multinomial, and sample-based unbinned
likelihoods, which covers many use cases in high-energy physics. In the limit of infinite statistics,
they reduce to the respective standard probability distributions. In the general case of arbitrary
Monte Carlo weights, the expressions involve the fourth Lauricella function $F_D$, for which we
find a new finite-sum representation in a certain parameter setting. The result also represents
an exact form for Carlson's Dirichlet average $R_n$ with $n>0$, and thereby an efficient way to calculate
the probability generating function of the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution, the extended
divided difference of a monomial, or arbitrary moments of univariate B-splines. We demonstrate
the bias reduction of our approach with a typical toy Monte Carlo problem, estimating the normalization
of a peak in a falling energy spectrum, and compare the results with previously published methods
from the literature.
