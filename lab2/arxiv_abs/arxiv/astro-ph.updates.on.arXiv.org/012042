We perform an extensive review of the numerous studies and methods used to determine the total mass
of the Milky Way. We group the various methods into seven broad classes, including: i) estimating
Galactic escape velocity using high velocity objects; ii) measuring the rotation curve through
terminal and circular velocities; iii) modeling halo stars, globular clusters and satellite galaxies
with the Spherical Jeans equation and iv) with phase-space distribution functions; v) simulating
and modeling the dynamics of stellar streams and their progenitors; vi) modeling the motion of the
Milky Way, M31 and other distant satellites under the framework of Local Group timing argument;
and vii) measurements made by linking the brightest Galactic satellites to their counterparts
in simulations. For each class of methods, we introduce their theoretical and observational background,
the method itself, the sample of available tracer objects, model assumptions, uncertainties,
limits and the corresponding measurements that have been achieved in the past. Both the measured
total masses within the radial range probed by tracer objects and the extrapolated virial masses
are discussed and quoted. We also discuss the role of modern numerical simulations in terms of helping
to validate model assumptions, understanding systematic uncertainties and calibrating the measurements.
While measurements in the last two decades show a factor of two scatters, recent measurements using
\textit{Gaia} DR2 data are approaching a higher precision. We end with a detailed discussion of
future developments, especially as the size and quality of the observational data will increase
tremendously with current and future surveys. In such cases, the systematic uncertainties will
be dominant and thus will necessitate a much more rigorous testing and characterization of the various
mass determination methods.
