Magnetic fields are believed to be generated in the cores of massive main sequence stars, and these
may survive on to later stages of evolution. Observations of depressed dipole modes in red giant
stars have been touted as evidence for these fields, but the predictions of existing magnetic theories
have difficulty accommodating several aspects, including the need to return a fraction of wave
energy from the core to the envelope, and the persistent gravity-like character of affected modes.
In this work we perform a Hamiltonian ray tracing study investigating the dynamics of magneto-gravity
waves in full spherical geometry, using realistic stellar models and magnetic field configurations.
This technique applies in the limit where wavelengths are much shorter than scales of background
variation. We conduct a comprehensive exploration of parameter space, examining the roles of wave
frequency, spherical harmonic degree, wavevector polarisation, incoming latitude, field strength,
field radius, and evolutionary state. We demonstrate that even in the presence of a strong field,
there exist trajectories where waves remain predominantly gravity-like in character, and these
are able to undergo reflection out of the core much like pure gravity waves. The remaining trajectories
are ones where waves acquire significant Alfven character, becoming trapped and eventually dissipated.
Orientation effects, i.e. wavevector polarisation and incoming latitude, are found to be crucial
factors in determining the outcome (trapped versus reflected) of individual wave packets. The
allowance for partial energy return from the core offers a solution to the conundrum faced by the
magnetic hypothesis.
