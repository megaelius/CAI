The POLARBEAR-2/Simons Array Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization experiment is an
upgrade and expansion of the existing POLARBEAR-1 (PB-1) experiment, located in the Atacama desert
in Chile. Along with the CMB temperature and $E$-mode polarization anisotropies, PB-1 and the Simons
Array study the CMB $B$-mode polarization anisotropies produced at large angular scales by inflationary
gravitational waves, and at small angular scales by gravitational lensing. These measurements
provide constraints on various cosmological and particle physics parameters, such as the tensor-to-scalar
ratio $r$, and the sum of the neutrino masses. The Simons Array consists of three 3.5 m diameter telescopes
with upgraded POLARBEAR-2 (PB-2) cryogenic receivers, named PB-2a, -2b, and -2c. PB-2a and -2b
will observe the CMB over multiple bands centered at 95 GHz and 150 GHz, while PB-2c will observe at
220 GHz and 270 GHz, which will enable enhanced foreground separation and de-lensing. Each Simons
Array receiver consists of two cryostats which share the same vacuum space: an optics tube containing
the cold reimaging lenses and Lyot stop, infrared-blocking filters, and cryogenic half-wave plate;
and a backend which contains the focal plane detector array, cold readout components, and millikelvin
refrigerator. Each PB-2 focal plane array is comprised of 7,588 dual-polarization, multi-chroic,
lenslet- and antenna-coupled, Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers which are cooled to 250
mK and read out using Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) through a digital
frequency division multiplexing scheme with a multiplexing factor of 40. In this work we describe
progress towards commissioning the PB-2b and -2c receivers including cryogenic design, characterization,
and performance of both the PB-2b and -2c backend cryostats.
