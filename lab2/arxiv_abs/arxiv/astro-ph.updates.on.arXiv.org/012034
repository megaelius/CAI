Observations of scattered light and thermal emission from hot Jupiter exoplanets have suggested
the presence of inhomogeneous aerosols in their atmospheres. 3D general circulation models (GCMs)
that attempt to model the effects of aerosols have been developed to understand the physical processes
that underlie their dynamical structures. In this work, we investigate how different approaches
to aerosol modeling in GCMs of hot Jupiters affect high-resolution thermal emission spectra throughout
the duration of the planet's orbit. Using results from a GCM with temperature-dependent cloud formation,
we calculate spectra of a representative hot Jupiter with different assumptions regarding the
vertical extent and thickness of clouds. We then compare these spectra from models in which clouds
are absent or simply post-processed (i.e., added subsequently to the completed clear model). We
show that the temperature-dependent treatment of clouds in the GCM produces high-resolution emission
spectra that are markedly different from the clear and post-processed cases---both in the continuum
flux levels and line profiles---and that increasing the vertical extent and thickness of clouds
leads to bigger changes in these features. We evaluate the net Doppler shifts of the spectra induced
by global winds and the planet's rotation and show that they are strongly phase-dependent, especially
for models with thicker and more extended clouds. This work further demonstrates the importance
of radiative feedback in cloudy atmospheric models of hot Jupiters, as this can have a significant
impact on interpreting spectroscopic observations of exoplanet atmospheres.
