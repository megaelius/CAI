Our aim is to calculate the evolution of Algol binaries within the framework of the osculating orbital
theory, which considers the perturbing forces acting on the orbit of each star arising from mass
exchange via Roche lobe overflow (RLOF). The scheme is compared to results calculated from a `classical'
prescription. Using our stellar binary evolution code BINSTAR, we calculate the orbital evolution
of Algol binaries undergoing case A and case B mass transfer, by applying the osculating scheme.
The velocities of the ejected and accreted material are evaluated by solving the restricted three-body
equations of motion, within the ballistic approximation. This allows us to determine the change
of linear momentum of each star, and the gravitational force applied by the mass transfer stream.
Torques applied on the stellar spins by tides and mass transfer are also considered. Using the osculating
formalism gives shorter post-mass transfer orbital periods typically by a factor of 4 compared
to the classical scheme, owing to the gravitational force applied onto the stars by the mass transfer
stream. Additionally, during the rapid phase of mass exchange, the donor star is spun down on a timescale
shorter than the tidal synchronization timescale, leading to sub-synchronous rotation. Consequently,
between 15 and 20 per cent of the material leaving the inner-Lagrangian point is accreted back onto
the donor (so-called `self-accretion'), further enhancing orbital shrinkage. Self-accretion,
and the sink of orbital angular momentum which mass transfer provides, may potentially lead to more
contact binaries. Even though Algols are mainly considered, the osculating prescription is applicable
to all types of interacting binaries, including those with eccentric orbits.
