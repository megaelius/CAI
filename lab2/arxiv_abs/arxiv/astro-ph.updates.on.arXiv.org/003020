A direct consequence of hierarchical galaxy formation is the existence of dual supermassive black
holes (SMBHs), which may be preferentially triggered as active galactic nuclei (AGN) during galaxy
mergers. Despite decades of searching, however, dual AGNs are extremely rare, and most have been
discovered serendipitously. Using the all-sky WISE survey, we identified a population of over
100 morphologically identified interacting galaxies or mergers that display red mid-infrared
colors often associated in extragalactic sources with powerful AGNs. The vast majority of these
advanced mergers are optically classified as star-forming galaxies suggesting that they may represent
an obscured population of AGNs that cannot be found through optical studies. In this work, we present
Chandra/ACIS observations and near-infrared spectra with the Large Binocular Telescope of six
advanced mergers with projected pair separations less than ~ 10 kpc. The combined X-ray, near-infrared,
and mid-infrared properties of these mergers provide confirmation that four out of the six mergers
host at least one AGN, with four of the mergers possibly hosting dual AGNs with projected separations
less than ~10 kpc, despite showing no firm evidence for AGNs based on optical spectroscopic studies.
Our results demonstrate that 1) optical studies miss a significant fraction of single and dual AGNs
in advanced mergers, and 2) mid-infrared pre-selection is extremely effective in identifying
dual AGN candidates in late-stage mergers. Our multi-wavelength observations suggest that the
buried AGNs in these mergers are highly absorbed, with intrinsic column densities in excess of N_H
>10^24cm^-2, consistent with hydrodynamic simulations.
