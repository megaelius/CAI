Previous analyses of the spectra of OB-type stars in the Magellanic Clouds have identified targets
with low projected rotational velocities and relatively high nitrogen abundances. The VFTS obtained
spectroscopy for B-type 434 stars. We have estimated atmospheric parameters and nitrogen abundances
using TLUSTY model atmospheres for 54 B-type targets that appear to be single, have projected rotational
velocities <80 \kms and were not classified as supergiants. In addition, nitrogen abundances for
34 similar stars from a previous survey have been re-evaluated. Approximately 75-80% of the targets
have nitrogen enhancements of less than 0.3 dex, consistent with them having experienced only small
amounts of mixing. However, stars with low projected rotational velocities <40 \kms and significant
nitrogen enrichments are found in both our samples and simulations imply that these cannot all be
rapidly rotating objects observed near pole-on. Adopting an enhancement threshold of 0.6 dex,
we observed five stars, yet stellar evolution models with rotation predict only 1.25$\pm$1.11
for random stellar viewing inclinations. The excess of such objects is estimated to be 20-30% of
all stars with current rotational velocities of less than 40 \kms and 2-4% of the total single B-type
sample. These estimates constitute lower limits for stars that appear inconsistent with current
grids of stellar evolutionary models. Including targets with smaller nitrogen enhancements of
greater than 0.2 dex implies larger percentages of targets that are inconsistent with current evolutionary
models, viz. 70% of the stars with rotational velocities less than 40 \kms and 6-8% of the total single
stellar population. We consider possible explanations of which the most promising would appear
to be breaking due to magnetic fields or stellar mergers with subsequent magnetic braking.
