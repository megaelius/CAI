HD 189733 is an exoplanetary system consisting of a transiting hot Jupiter and an active K2V-type
main sequence star. We aim to use VLT/UVES high resolution echelle spectra to study a stellar flare.
We have performed simultaneous analyses of the temporal evolution in several chromospheric stellar
lines, namely, the Ca II H and K lines, Halpha, Hbeta, Hgamma, Hdelta, Hepsilon, the Ca II infrared
triplet line, and He I D3. Observations were carried out with a time resolution of approximately
1 min for a duration of four hours, including a complete planetary transit. We determine the energy
released during the flare in all studied chromospheric lines combined to be about 8.7e31 erg, which
puts this event at the upper end of flare energies observed on the Sun. Our analysis does not reveal
any significant delay of the flare peak observed in the Balmer and Ca II H and K lines, although we find
a clear difference in the temporal evolution of these lines. The He I D3 shows additional absorption
possibly related to the flare event. Based on the flux released in Ca II H and K lines during the flare,
we estimate the soft X-ray flux emission to be 7e30 erg. The observed flare can be ranked as a moderate
flare on a K-type star and confirms a rather high activity level of HD 189733 host star. The cores of
the studied chromospheric lines demonstrate the same behavior and let us study the flare evolution.
We demonstrate that the activity of an exoplanet host star can play an important role in the detection
of exoplanet atmospheres, since these are frequently discovered as an additional absorption in
the line cores. A possible star-planet interaction responsible for a flare occurrence during a
transit can neither be confirmed nor ruled out.
