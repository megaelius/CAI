We contrast predictions for the high-redshift galaxy population and reionization history between
Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and an alternative DM model based on the recently developed ETHOS framework
(Effective Theory of Structure Formation; Cyr-Racine et al. 2016, Vogelsberger et al. 2016). We
focus on an ETHOS model that alleviates the small-scale CDM challenges within the Local Group, and
perform the currently highest resolution hydrodynamical volume $\sim$ (36 Mpc)$^3$ simulations
within ETHOS and CDM combined with a state-of-the-art galaxy formation model (gas cell mass $\sim10^5M_{\odot}$,
minimum gas softening $\sim$ 180 pc) to quantify the abundance of galaxies at high redshift and their
impact on reionisation. While current observations of high-redshift luminosity functions cannot
differentiate between ETHOS and CDM, deep JWST surveys of strongly-lensed, inherently faint galaxies
could potentially detect or constrain a primordial cutoff in the power spectrum. We find that ETHOS
galaxies have higher ultraviolet (UV) luminosities than their CDM counterparts and a faster build
up of the fainter end of the UV luminosity function; a distinct behaviour offering a promising avenue
to identify a primordial power spectrum cutoff. This effect, however, makes the optical depth to
reionisation less sensitive to this cutoff, such that the ETHOS model differs from the CDM $\tau$
value by only 10% and is consistent with Planck limits, as long as the effective escape fraction is
in the 0.1 -- 0.5 range. We conclude that high redshift observations in the JWST era have the potential
to probe non-CDM models that offer attractive solutions to the Local Group CDM problems.
