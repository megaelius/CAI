We use the EAGLE cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations to predict the column density and equivalent
width distributions of intergalactic O VII ($E=574$ eV) and O VIII ($E=654$ eV) absorbers at low
redshift. These two ions are predicted to account for 40% of the gas-phase oxygen, which implies
that they are key tracers of cosmic metals. We find that their column density distributions evolve
little at observable column densities from redshift 1 to 0, and that they are sensitive to AGN feedback,
which strongly reduces the number of strong (column density $N \gtrsim 10^{16} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2})$
absorbers. The distributions have a break at $N \sim 10^{16} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, corresponding
to overdensities of $\sim 10^{2}$, likely caused by the transition from sheet/filament to halo
gas. Absorption systems with $N \gtrsim 10^{16} \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ are dominated by collisionally
ionized O VII and O VIII, while the ionization state of oxygen at lower column densities is also influenced
by photoionization. At these high column densities, O VII and O VIII arising in the same structures
probe systematically different gas temperatures, meaning their line ratio does not translate
into a simple estimate of temperature. While O VII and O VIII column densities and covering fractions
correlate poorly with the H I column density at $N_{\mathrm{H \, I}} \gtrsim 10^{15} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$,
O VII and O VIII column densities are higher in this regime than at the more common, lower H I column
densities. The column densities of O VI and especially Ne VIII, which have strong absorption lines
in the UV, are good predictors of the strengths of O VII and O VIII absorption and can hence aid in the
detection of the X-ray lines.
