FRB 190608 was detected by ASKAP and localized to a spiral galaxy at $z_{host}=0.11778$ in the SDSS
footprint. The burst has a large dispersion measure ($DM_{FRB}=339.8$ $pc/cm^3$) compared to
the expected cosmic average at its redshift. It also has a large rotation measure ($RM_{FRB}=353$
$rad/m^2$) and scattering timescale ($\tau=3.3$ $ms$ at $1.28$ $GHz$). Chittidi et al (2020) perform
a detailed analysis of the ultraviolet and optical emission of the host galaxy and estimate the host
DM contribution to be $137\pm 43$ $pc/cm^3$. This work complements theirs and reports the analysis
of the optical data of galaxies in the foreground of FRB 190608 to explore their contributions to
the FRB signal. Together, the two manuscripts delineate an observationally driven, end-to-end
study of matter distribution along an FRB sightline; the first study of its kind. Combining KCWI
observations and public SDSS data, we estimate the expected cosmic dispersion measure $DM_{cosmic}$
along the sightline to FRB 190608. We first estimate the contribution of hot, ionized gas in intervening
virialized halos ($DM_{halos} \approx 7-28$ $pc/cm^3$). Then, using the Monte Carlo Physarum
Machine (MCPM) methodology, we produce a 3D map of ionized gas in cosmic web filaments and compute
the DM contribution from matter outside halos ($DM_{IGM} \approx 91-126$ $pc/cm^3$). This implies
a greater fraction of ionized gas along this sightline is extant outside virialized halos. We also
investigate whether the intervening halos can account for the large FRB rotation measure and pulse
width and conclude that it is implausible. Both the pulse broadening and the large Faraday rotation
likely arise from the progenitor environment or the host galaxy.
