[abridged] WFIRST is uniquely capable of finding planets with masses as small as Mars at separations
comparable to Jupiter, i.e., beyond the current ice lines of their stars. These planets fall between
the close-in planets found by Kepler and the wide separation gas giants seen by direct imaging and
ice giants inferred from ALMA observations. Furthermore, the smallest planets WFIRST can detect
are smaller than the planets probed by RV and Gaia at comparable separations. Interpreting planet
populations to infer the underlying formation and evolutionary processes requires combining
results from multiple detection methods to measure the full variation of planets as a function of
planet size, orbital separation, and host star mass. Microlensing is the only way to find planets
from 0.5 to 5M_E at 1 to 5au. The case for a microlensing survey from space has not changed in the past
20 yrs: space allows wide-field diffraction-limited observations that resolve main-sequence
stars in the bulge, which allows the detection and characterization of the smallest signals including
those from planets with masses at least as small as Mars. What has changed is that ground-based (GB)
microlensing is reaching its limits, underscoring the scientific necessity for a space-based
survey. GB microlensing has found a break in the mass-ratio distribution at about a Neptune, implying
that these are the most common microlensing planet and that planets smaller than this are rare. However,
GB microlensing reaches its detection limits only slightly below the observed break. WFIRST will
measure the shape of the mass-ratio function below the break by finding numerous smaller planets:
500 Neptunes, 600 gas giants, 200 Earths, and planets as small as 0.1M_E. Because it will also measure
host masses and distances, WFIRST will also track the behavior of the planet distribution as a function
of separation and host star mass.
