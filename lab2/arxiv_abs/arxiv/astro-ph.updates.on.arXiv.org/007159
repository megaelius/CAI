Galaxies in the reionization-era have been shown to have prominent [OIII]+H$\beta$ emission.
Little is known about the gas conditions and radiation field of this population, making it challenging
to interpret the spectra emerging at $z\gtrsim6$. Motivated by this shortcoming, we have initiated
a large MMT spectroscopic survey targeting rest-optical emission lines in 227 intense [OIII] emitting
galaxies at $1.3<z<2.4$. This sample complements the MOSDEF and KBSS surveys, extending to lower
stellar masses ($10^7-10^8 M_\odot$) and larger specific star formation rates ($5-300$ Gyr$^{-1}$),
providing a window on galaxies directly following a burst or recent upturn in star formation. The
hydrogen ionizing production efficiency is found to increase with the [OIII] EW, in a manner similar
to that found in local galaxies by Chevallard et al. (2018). We describe how this relationship helps
explain the anomalous success rate in identifying Ly$\alpha$ emission in $z\gtrsim7$ galaxies
with strong [O III]+H$\beta$ emission. We probe the impact of the intense radiation field on the
ISM using O32 and Ne3O2, two ionization-sensitive indices. Both are found to scale with the [OIII]
EW, revealing extreme ionization conditions not commonly seen in older and more massive galaxies.
In the most intense line emitters, the indices have very large average values (O32 $=9.1$, Ne3O2
$=0.5$) that have been shown to be linked to ionizing photon escape. We discuss implications for
the nature of galaxies most likely to have O32 values associated with significant LyC escape. Finally
we consider the optimal strategy for JWST spectroscopic investigations of galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$
where the strongest rest-optical lines are no longer visible with NIRSpec.
