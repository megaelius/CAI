Shock waves and the associated phenomena generated by strongly ablating meteoroids with sizes
greater than a few millimeters in the lower transitional flow regime of the Earth's atmosphere are
the least explored aspect of meteor science. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of
literature covering meteor generated shock wave phenomena, from the aspect of both meteor science
and hypersonic gas dynamics. The primary emphasis of this review is placed on the mechanisms and
dynamics of the meteor shock waves. We discuss key aspects of both shock generation and propagation,
including the great importance of the hydrodynamic shielding that develops around the meteoroid.
In addition to this in-depth review, the discussion is extended to an overview of meteoroid fragmentation,
followed by airburst type events associated with large, deep penetrating meteoroids. This class
of objects has a significant potential to cause extensive material damage and even human casualties
on the ground, and as such is of great interest to the planetary defense community. To date, no comprehensive
model exists that accurately describes the flow field and shock wave formation of a strongly ablating
meteoroid in the non-continuum flow regime. Thus, we briefly present the current state of numerical
models that describe the comparatively slower flow of air over non-ablating bodies in the rarefied
regime. In respect to the elusive nature of meteor generated shock wave detection, we also discuss
relevant aspects and applications of meteor radar and infrasound studies as tools that can be utilized
to study meteor shock waves and related phenomena.
