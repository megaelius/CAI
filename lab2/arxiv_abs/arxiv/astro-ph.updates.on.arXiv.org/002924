Recent versions of the observed cosmic star-formation history (SFH) have resolved an inconsistency
between the SFH and the observed cosmic stellar mass density history. Here, we show that the same
SFH revision scales up by a factor $\sim 2$ the delay-time distribution (DTD) of Type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia), as determined from the observed volumetric SN Ia rate history, and thus brings it into line
with other field-galaxy SN Ia DTD measurements. The revised-SFH-based DTD has a $t^{-1.1 \pm 0.1}$
form and a Hubble-time-integrated SN Ia production efficiency of $N/M_\star=1.3 \pm 0.1$ SNe Ia
per $1000~{\rm M_\odot}$ of formed stellar mass. Using these revised histories and updated, purely
empirical iron yields of the various SN types, we rederive the cosmic iron accumulation history.
Core-collapse SNe and SNe Ia have contributed about equally to the total mass of iron in the Universe
today, as indicated also for the Sun. We find the track of the average cosmic gas element in the [$\alpha$/Fe]
vs. [Fe/H] abundance-ratio plane, as well as the track for gas in galaxy clusters, which have a higher
DTD and have had a distinct, burst-like SFH. Our cosmic $[\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] track is broadly
similar to the observed main locus of Galactic stars in this plane, indicating a Milky Way (MW) SFH
similar in form to the cosmic one. We easily find a simple MW SFH that makes the track closely match
this stellar locus. The cluster DTD with a short-burst SFH at $z=3$ produces a track that matches
remarkably well the observed "high-$\alpha$" locus of MW stars, suggesting the halo/thick-disk
population has had a galaxy-cluster-like formation history. Thus, a very simple two-component
SFH model, combined with empirical DTDs and SN iron yields, suffice to closely reproduce the MW's
stellar abundance patterns.
