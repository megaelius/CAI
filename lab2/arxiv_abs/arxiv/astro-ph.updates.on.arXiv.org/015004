Developed as NASA Astrophysics Probe-class mission, the Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics
(POEMMA) is designed to identify the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and to observe
cosmic neutrinos. POEMMA consists of two spacecraft flying in a loose formation at 525 km altitude,
28.5$^\circ$ inclination orbits. Each spacecraft hosts a Schmidt telescope with a large collecting
area and wide Field-of-View (FoV). A novel focal plane is employed that is optimized to observe both
the UV fluorescence signal from extensive air showers (EASs) and the optical Cherenkov signals
from EASs. In UHECR stereo fluorescence mode, POEMMA will measure the spectrum, composition, and
full-sky distribution of the UHECRs above 20 EeV with high statistics along with remarkable sensitivity
to UHE neutrinos. The POEMMA spacecraft are designed to quickly re-orient to a Target-of-Opportunity
(ToO) neutrino mode to observe transient astrophysical sources with unique sensitivity. In this
mode, POEMMA will be able to detect cosmic tau neutrino events above 20 PeV by measuring the upward-moving
EASs for $\tau$-lepton decays induced from tau neutrino interactions in the Earth. In this paper,
POEMMA's science goals and instrument design are summarized with a focus on the SiPM implementation
in POEMMA, along with a detailed discussion of the properties of the Cherenkov EAS signal in the context
of wide wavelength sensitivity offered by SiPMs. A comparison of the fluorescence response between
SiPMs and the MAPMTs currently planned for use in POEMMA will also be discussed, assessing the potential
for SiPMs to perform EAS fluorescence measurements.
