Massive stars play an important role in explaining the cosmic ray spectrum below the knee, possibly
even up to the ankle, i.e. up to energies of 1e15 eV or 1e18.5 eV, respectively. In particular, Supernova
Remnants are discussed as one of the main candidates to explain the cosmic ray spectrum. Even before
their violent deaths, during the stars' regular life times, cosmic rays can be accelerated in wind
environments. High-energy gamma-ray measurements indicate hadronic acceleration binary systems,
leading to both periodic gamma-ray emission from binaries like LSI+60~303 and continuous emission
from colliding wind environments like Eta Carinae. The detection of neutrinos and photons from
hadronic interactions are one of the most promising methods to identify particle acceleration
sites. In this paper, future prospects to detect neutrinos from colliding wind environments in
massive stars are investigated. In particular, the seven most promising candidates for emission
from colliding wind binaries are investigated to provide an estimate of the signal strength. The
expected signal of a single source is about a factor of $5-10$ below the current IceCube sensitivity
and it is therefore not accessible at the moment. What is discussed in addition is future the possibility
to measure low-energy neutrino sources with detectors like PINGU and ORCA: the minimum of the atmospheric
neutrino flux at around 25 GeV from neutrino oscillations provides an opportunity to reduce the
background and increase the significance to searches for GeV/TeV neutrino sources. This paper
presents the first idea, detailed studies including the detector's effective areas will be necessary
in the future to test the feasibility of such an approach.
