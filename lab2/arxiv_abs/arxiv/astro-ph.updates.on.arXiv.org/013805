We present a systematic analysis of the constraints $\sigma_\gamma$ on the mass profile slope $\gamma$
obtainable when fitting a singular power-law ellipsoid model to a typical strong lensing observation
of an extended source. These results extend our previous analysis of circular systems, Paper I.
We draw our results from 676 mock observations covering a range of image configurations, each created
with a fixed signal to noise ratio $S=100$ in the images. We analyse the results using a combination
of theory and a simplified modelling technique which identifies the contribution to the constraints
of the individual fluxes and positions in each of the two or four images. The main results are: 1. Regardless
of the lens ellipticity, the constraints $\sigma_\gamma$ for two image systems are well described
by the results of Paper I, transformed to elliptical coordinates; 2. We derive an analytical expression
for $\sigma_\gamma$ for systems with the source aligned with the axis of the lens; 3. For both two-image
systems and aligned systems the slope uncertainties $\sigma_\gamma$ are limited by the flux uncertainties;
4. The constraints for off-axis four-image systems are a factor of two to eight better, depending
on source size, than for two-image systems, and improve with increasing lens ellipticity. We show
that the constraints on $\gamma$ in these systems derive from the complementary positional information
of the images and the flux measurements do not contribute to $\sigma_\gamma$. The complementarity
improves as the offset of the source from the axis increases, such that the best constraints $\sigma_\gamma<0.01$,
for $S=100$, occur when the source approaches the caustic.
