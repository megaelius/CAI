The investigation of star forming regions have enormously benefited from the recent advent of the
ALMA interferometer. More specifically, the unprecedented combination of high-sensitivity
and high-angular resolution provided by ALMA allows one to shed light on the jet/disk systems associated
with a Sun-like mass protostar. Also astrochemistry enjoyed the possibility to analyze complex
spectra obtained using large bandwidths: several interstellar Complex Organic Molecules (iCOMs;
C-bearing species with at least 6 atoms) have been imaged around protostars. This in turn boosted
the study of the astrochemistry at work during the earliest phases of star formation paving the way
to the chemical complexity in planetary systems where Life could emerge. There is mounting evidence
that the observations of iCOMs can be used as unique tool to shed light, on Solar System scales (< 50
au), on the molecular content of protostellar disk. The increase of iCOMs abundances occur only
under very selective physical conditions, such as those associated low-velocity shocks found
where the infalling envelope is impacting the rotating accretion disk. The imaging of these regions
with simpler molecules such as CO or CS is indeed paradoxically hampered by their high abundances
and consequently high line opacities which do not allow the observers to disentangle all the emitting
components at these small scales. In this respect, we review the state-of-the art of the ALMA analysis
about the standard Sun-like star forming region in Orion named HH 212. We show (i) how all the physical
components involved in the formation of a Sun-like star can be revealed only by observing different
molecular tracers, and (ii) how the observation of iCOMs emission, observed to infer the chemical
composition of star forming regions, can be used also as unique tracer to image protostellar disks
on Solar System scales.
