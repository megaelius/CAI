We present a detailed investigation into the properties of GW170729, the gravitational wave with
the most massive and distant source confirmed to date. We employ an extensive set of waveform models,
including new improved models that incorporate the effect of higher-order waveform modes which
are particularly important for massive systems. We find no indication of spin-precession, but
the inclusion of higher-order modes in the models results in an improved estimate for the mass ratio
of $(0.3-0.8)$ at the 90\% credible level. Our updated measurement excludes equal masses at that
level. We also find that models with higher-order modes lead to the data being more consistent with
a smaller effective spin, with the probability that the effective spin is greater than zero being
reduced from $99\%$ to $94\%$. The 90\% credible interval for the effective spin parameter is now
$(-0.01-0.50)$. Additionally, the recovered signal-to-noise ratio increases by $\sim0.3$ units
compared to analyses without higher-order modes. We study the effect of common spin priors on the
derived spin and mass measurements, and observe small shifts in the spins, while the masses remain
unaffected. We argue that our conclusions are robust against systematic errors in the waveform
models. We also compare the above waveform-based analysis which employs compact-binary waveform
models to a more flexible wavelet- and chirplet-based analysis. We find consistency between the
two, with overlaps of $\sim 0.9$, typical of what is expected from simulations of signals similar
to GW170729, confirming that the data are well-described by the existing waveform models. Finally,
we study the possibility that the primary component of GW170729 was the remnant of a past merger of
two black holes and find this scenario to be indistinguishable from the standard formation scenario.
