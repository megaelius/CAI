The goal of the Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages (POETS) survey is to image the disk-outflow
interface on scales of 10-100 au in a statistically significant sample (36) of luminous young stellar
objects (YSO), targeting both the molecular and ionized components of the outflows. The outflow
kinematics is studied at milliarcsecond scales through VLBI observations of the 22 GHz water masers.
We employed the JVLA at 6, 13, and 22 GHz in the A- and B-Array configurations to determine the spatial
structure and the spectral index of the radio continuum emission. In about half of the targets, the
water masers observed at separation <= 1000 au from the YSOs trace either or both of these kinematic
structures: 1) a spatially elongated distribution oriented at close angle with the direction of
collimation of the maser proper motions (PM), and 2) a linear LSR velocity (Vlsr) gradient across
the YSO position. The kinematic structure (1) is readily interpreted in terms of a protostellar
jet, as confirmed in some targets via the comparison with independent observations of the YSO jets,
in thermal (continuum and line) emissions, reported in the literature. The kinematic structure
(2) is interpreted in terms of a disk-wind (DW) seen almost edge-on on the basis of several pieces
of evidence: first, it is invariably directed perpendicular to the YSO jet; second, it agrees in
orientation and polarity with the Vlsr gradient in thermal emissions (when reported in the literature)
identifying the YSO disk at scales of <= 1000~au; third, the PMs of the masers delineating the Vlsr
gradients hint at flow motions at a speed of 10-20 km/s directed at large angles with the disk midplane.
In the remaining targets, the maser PMs are not collimated but rather tend to align along two almost
perpendicular directions, and could originate in DW-jet systems slightly inclined (<= 30 deg)
with respect to edge-on.
