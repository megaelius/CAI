We investigate the performance of a simple Bayesian fitting approach to correct the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) B-mode polarization for gravitational lensing effects in the recovered probability
distribution of the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We perform a two-dimensional power spectrum fit of
the amplitude of the primordial B-modes (tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$) and the amplitude of the
lensing B-modes (parameter $A_{lens}$), jointly with the estimation of the astrophysical foregrounds
including both synchrotron and thermal dust emissions. Using this Bayesian framework, we forecast
the ability of the proposed CMB space mission LiteBIRD to constrain $r$ in the presence of realistic
lensing and foreground contributions. We compute the joint posterior distribution of $r$ and $A_{lens}$,
which we improve by adopting a prior on $A_{lens}$ taken from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) measurement.
As it applies to the power spectrum, this approach cannot mitigate the uncertainty on $r$ that is
due to E-mode cosmic variance transferred to B-modes by lensing, unlike standard delensing techniques
that are performed on maps. However, the method allows to correct for the bias on $r$ induced by lensing,
at the expense of a larger uncertainty due to the increased volume of the parameter space. We quantify,
for different values of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the trade-off between bias correction and
increase of uncertainty on $r$. For LiteBIRD simulations, which include foregrounds and lensing
contamination, we find that correcting the foreground-cleaned CMB B-mode power spectrum for the
lensing bias, not the lensing cosmic variance, still guarantees a $3\sigma$ detection of $r=5\times
10^{-3}$. The significance of the detection is increased to $6\sigma$ when the current SPT prior
on $A_{lens}$ is adopted.
