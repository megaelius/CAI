We describe test observations made with a customized 640 x 512 pixel Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs)
prototype astronomical camera on the 100" DuPont telescope. This is the first test of InGaAs as a
cost-effective alternative to HgCdTe for research-grade astronomical observations. The camera
exhibits an instrument background of 113 e-/sec/pixel (dark + thermal) at an operating temperature
of -40C for the sensor, maintained by a simple thermo-electric cooler. The optical train and mechanical
structure float at ambient temperature with no cold stop, in contrast to most IR instruments which
must be cooled to mitigate thermal backgrounds. Measurements of the night sky using a reimager with
plate scale of 0.4 arc seconds / pixel show that the sky flux in Y is comparable to the dark current.
At J the sky brightness exceeds dark current by a factor of four, and hence dominates the noise budget.
The sensor read noise of ~43e- falls below sky+dark noise for exposures of t>7 seconds in Y and 3.5
seconds in J. We present test observations of several selected science targets, including high-significance
detections of a lensed Type Ia supernova, a type IIb supernova, and a z=6.3 quasar. Deeper images
are obtained for two local galaxies monitored for IR transients, and a galaxy cluster at z=0.87.
Finally, we observe a partial transit of the hot JupiterHATS34b, demonstrating the photometric
stability required over several hours to detect a 1.2% transit depth at high significance. A tiling
of available larger-format sensors would produce an IR survey instrument with significant cost
savings relative to HgCdTe-based cameras, if one is willing to forego the K band. Such a camera would
be sensitive for a week or more to isotropic emission from r-process kilonova ejecta similar to that
observed in GW170817, over the full 190 Mpc horizon of Advanced LIGO's design sensitivity for neutron
star mergers.
