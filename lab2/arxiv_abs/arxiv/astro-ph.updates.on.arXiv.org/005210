The shape of a galaxy's spatially unresolved, globally integrated 21-cm emission line depends
on its internal gas kinematics: galaxies with rotation-supported gas disks produce double-horned
profiles with steep wings, while galaxies with dispersion-supported gas produce Gaussian-like
profiles with sloped wings. Using mock observations of simulated galaxies from the FIRE project,
we show that one can therefore constrain a galaxy's gas kinematics from its unresolved 21-cm line
profile. In particular, we find that the kurtosis of the 21-cm line increases with decreasing $V/\sigma$,
and that this trend is robust across a wide range of masses, signal-to-noise ratios, and inclinations.
We then quantify the shapes of 21-cm line profiles from a morphologically unbiased sample of $\sim$2000
low-redshift, HI-detected galaxies with $M_{\rm star} = 10^{7-11} M_{\odot}$ and compare to the
simulated galaxies. At $M_{\rm star} \gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$, both the observed and simulated
galaxies produce double-horned profiles with low kurtosis and steep wings, consistent with rotation-supported
disks. Both the observed and simulated line profiles become more Gaussian-like (higher kurtosis
and less-steep wings) at lower masses, indicating increased dispersion support. However, the
simulated galaxies transition from rotation to dispersion support more strongly: at $M_{\rm star}
= 10^{8-10}M_{\odot}$, most of the simulations produce more Gaussian-like profiles than typical
observed galaxies with similar mass, indicating that gas in the low-mass simulated galaxies is,
on average, overly dispersion-supported. Most of the lower-mass simulated galaxies also have
somewhat lower gas fractions than the median of the observed population. The simulations nevertheless
reproduce the observed line-width baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, which is insensitive to rotation
vs. dispersion support.
