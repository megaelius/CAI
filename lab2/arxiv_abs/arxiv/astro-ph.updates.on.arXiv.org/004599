We report the discovery of a sub-Jupiter mass planet orbiting beyond the snow line of an M-dwarf most
likely in the Galactic disk as part of the joint Spitzer and ground-based monitoring of microlensing
planetary anomalies toward the Galactic bulge. The microlensing parameters are strongly constrained
by the light curve modeling and in particular by the Spitzer-based measurement of the microlens
parallax, $\pi_\mathrm{E}$. However, in contrast to many planetary microlensing events, there
are no caustic crossings, so the angular Einstein radius, $\theta_\mathrm{E}$ has only an upper
limit based on the light curve modeling alone. Additionally, the analysis leads us to identify 8
degenerate configurations: the four-fold microlensing parallax degeneracy being doubled by
a degeneracy in the caustic structure present at the level of the ground-based solutions. To pinpoint
the physical parameters, and at the same time to break the parallax degeneracy, we make use of a series
of arguments: the $\chi^2$ hierarchy, the Rich argument, and a prior Galactic model. The preferred
configuration is for a host at $D_L=3.73_{-0.67}^{+0.66}~\mathrm{kpc}$ with mass $M_\mathrm{L}=0.30_{-0.12}^{+0.15}~\mathrm{M_\odot}$,
orbited by a Saturn-like planet with $M_\mathrm{planet}=0.43_{-0.17}^{+0.21}~\mathrm{M_\mathrm{Jup}}$
at projected separation $a_\perp = 1.70_{-0.39}^{+0.38}~\mathrm{au}$, about 2.1 times beyond
the system snow line. Therefore, it adds to the growing population of sub-Jupiter planets orbiting
near or beyond the snow line of M-dwarfs discovered by microlensing. Based on the rules of the real-time
protocol for the selection of events to be followed up with Spitzer, this planet will not enter the
sample for measuring the Galactic distribution of planets.
