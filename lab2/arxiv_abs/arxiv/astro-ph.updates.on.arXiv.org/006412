Binary stars form from the same parent molecular cloud and thus have the same chemical composition.
Forming planets take building material (solids) away from the surrounding protoplanetary disc.
Assuming that the disc's accretion onto the star is the main process that clears the disc, the atmosphere
of the star will show abundance reductions caused by the material accreted by the forming planet(s).
If planets are only forming around one star of a binary system, the planet formation process can result
in abundance differences in wide binary stars, if their natal protoplanetary discs do not interact
during planet formation. Abundance differences in the atmospheres of wide binaries hosting giant
planets have already been observed and linked to the formation location of giant planets. Here,
we model how much building material is taken away for super-Earth planets that form inside/outside
of the water ice line as well as ice giants forming inside/outside of the CO ice line. Our model predicts
a significant abundance difference $\Delta$[X/H] in the stellar atmospheres of the planet-hosting
binary component. Our model predicts that super-Earths that form inside the water ice line ($r<r_{\rm
H_2O}$) will result in an $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta$[O/H] abundance difference in the their host
star that is a factor of 2 larger than for super-Earths formed outside the water ice line ($r>r_{\rm
H_2O}$) in the water rich parts of the disc. Additionally, our model shows that the $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta$[C/H]
abundance difference in the host star is at least a factor of 3 larger for ice giants formed at $r<r_{\rm
CO}$ compared to ice giants formed far out in the protoplanetary disc ($r>r_{\rm CO}$). Future observations
of wide binary star systems hosting super-Earths and ice giants could therefore help to constrain
the migration pathway of these planets and thus constrain planet formation theories.
