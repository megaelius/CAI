Exoplanet catalogs produced by surveys suffer from a lack of completeness (not every planet is detected)
and less than perfect reliability (not every planet in the catalog is a true planet). Occurrence
rate studies of the exoplanet population structure using such a catalog must be corrected for completeness
and reliability. The final Kepler data release, DR25, features a uniformly vetted planet candidate
catalog and completeness and reliability products that allow for occurrence rates that are corrected
for completeness and reliability. We present a new probabilistic approach to the characterization
of Kepler completeness and reliability, making full use of the Kepler DR25 completeness and reliability
products. Our approach is robust against sparse data. We illustrate the impact of completeness
and reliability using a standard Poisson-likelihood-based occurrence rate method, using a recent
stellar properties catalog that incorporates Gaia stellar radii and uniform treatment of the entire
stellar population. This is the first exoplanet occurrence rate calculation that makes full use
of the DR25 completeness and reliability products. We find that correcting for reliability reduces
by a factor of two the occurrence of exoplanets with orbital period and radius within 20% of Earth's
around GK dwarf stars, from 0.044+0.021-0.015 to 0.019+0.012-0.008. We also explore alternative
occurrence rates, and show that using Gaia-based stellar radii rather than those in the DR25 stellar
properties reduces occurrence rates by a factor of two. This work is an example of how the community
can use the DR25 completeness and reliability products, which are publicly available at the NASA
Exoplanet Archive (this http URL) and the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (this http URL).
