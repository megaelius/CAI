The recent observations of muon charge ratio up to about 10 TeV and of atmospheric neutrinos up to
energies of about 400 TeV has triggered a renewed interest into the high-energy interaction models
and cosmic ray primary composition. A reviewed calculation of lepton spectra produced in cosmic-ray
induced extensive air showers is carried out with a primary cosmic-ray spectrum that fits the latest
direct measurements below the knee. In order to achieve this, we used a full Monte Carlo method to
derive the inclusive differential spectra (yields) of muons, muon neutrinos and electron neutrinos
at the surface for energies between 80 GeV and hundreds of PeV. The air shower simulator {\sc corsika}
6.990 was used for showering and propagation of the secondary particles through the atmosphere,
employing the established high-energy hadronic interaction models {\sc sibyll} 2.1, {\sc qgsjet-01}
and {\sc qgsjet-ii 03}. We show that the performance of the interaction models allows makes it possible
to predict the spectra within experimental uncertainties, while {\sc sibyll} generally yields
a higher flux at the surface than the qgsjet models. The calculation of the flavor and charge ratios
has lead to inconsistent results, mainly influenced by the different representations of the K/$\pi$
ratio within the models. Furthermore, we could quantify systematic uncertainties of atmospheric
muon- and neutrino fluxes, associated to the models of the primary cosmic-ray spectrum and the interaction
models. For most recent parametrizations of the cosmic-ray primary spectrum, atmospheric muons
can be determined with an uncertainty smaller than $^{+15}_{-13}$% of the average flux. Uncertainties
of the muon- and electron neutrino fluxes can be calculated within an average error of $^{+32}_{-22}$%
and $^{+25}_{-19}$%, respectively.
