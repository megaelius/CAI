We present medium resolution ($R\approx5300$) $K$-band integral field spectroscopy of six MYSOs.
The targets are selected from the RMS survey, and we used the NIFS on the Gemini North telescope. The
data show various spectral line features including Br$\gamma$, CO, H$_2$, and \mbox{He\,{\sc
i}}. The Br$\gamma$ line is detected in emission in all objects with $v_\mathrm{FWHM}\sim100$
-- 200 kms$^{-1}$. V645 Cyg shows a high-velocity P-Cygni profile between -800 kms$^{-1}$ and -300
kms$^{-1}$. We performed three-dimensional spectroastrometry to diagnose the circumstellar
environment in the vicinity of the central stars using the Br$\gamma$ line. We measured the centroids
of the velocity components with sub-mas precision. The centroids allow us to discriminate the blueshifted
and redshifted components in a roughly east--west direction in both IRAS 18151--1208 and S106 in
Br$\gamma$. This lies almost perpendicular to observed larger scale outflows. We conclude, given
the widths of the lines and the orientation of the spectroastrometric signature, that our results
trace a disc wind in both IRAS 18151--1208 and S106. The CO $\nu=2-0$ absorption lines at low $J$ transitions
are detected in IRAS 18151--1208 and AFGL 2136. We analysed the velocity structure of the neutral
gas discs. In IRAS 18151--1208, the absorption centroids of the blueshifted and redshifted components
are separated in a direction of north-east to south-west, nearly perpendicular to that of the larger
scale $H_2$ jet. The position-velocity relations of these objects can be reproduced with central
masses of 30 $M_{\sun}$ for IRAS 18151--1208 and 20 $M_{\sun}$ for AFGL 2136. We also detect CO $\nu=2-0$
bandhead emission in IRAS 18151--1208, S106 and V645 Cyg. The results can be fitted reasonably with
a Keplerian rotation model, with masses of 15, 20 and 20 $M_{\sun}$ respectively.
