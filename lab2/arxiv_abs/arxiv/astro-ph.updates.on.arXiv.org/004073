Dark matter haloes in which galaxies reside are likely to have a significant impact on their evolution.
We investigate the link between dark matter haloes and their constituent galaxies by measuring
the angular two-point correlation function of radio sources, using recently released 3 GHz imaging
over $\sim 2 \ \mathrm{deg}^2$ of the COSMOS field. We split the radio source population into Star
Forming Galaxies (SFGs) and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), and further separate the AGN into radiatively
efficient and inefficient accreters. Restricting our analysis to $z<1$, we find SFGs have a bias,
$b = 1.5 ^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$, at a median redshift of $z=0.62$. On the other hand, AGN are significantly
more strongly clustered with $b = 2.1\pm 0.2$ at a median redshift of 0.7. This supports the idea that
AGN are hosted by more massive haloes than SFGs. We also find low-accretion rate AGN are more clustered
($b = 2.9 \pm 0.3$) than high-accretion rate AGN ($b = 1.8^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$) at the same redshift ($z
\sim 0.7$), suggesting that low-accretion rate AGN reside in higher mass haloes. This supports
previous evidence that the relatively hot gas that inhabits the most massive haloes is unable to
be easily accreted by the central AGN, causing them to be inefficient. We also find evidence that
low-accretion rate AGN appear to reside in halo masses of $M_{h} \sim 3-4 \times 10^{13}h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$
at all redshifts. On the other hand, the efficient accreters reside in haloes of $M_{h} \sim 1-2 \times
10^{13}h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$ at low redshift but can reside in relatively lower mass haloes at higher
redshifts. This could be due to the increased prevalence of cold gas in lower mass haloes at $z \ge
1$ compared to $z<1$.
