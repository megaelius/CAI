The massive early-type galaxy (ETG) IC 1459 is a slowly rotating galaxy that exhibits a rapidly counter-rotating
kinematically decoupled core (KDC, $R_{\rm KDC}\approx 5^{\prime\prime}\approx 0.1 R_{\rm
e}$). To investigate the origin of its KDC, we coupled large data mosaics from the near-infrared
(NIR)/optical integral field unit (IFU) instruments K-band Multi-Object Spectrograph (KMOS)
and Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). We studied IC 1459's stellar populations and, for
the first time for a KDC, the spatially resolved initial mass function (IMF). We used full-spectral-fitting
to fit the stellar populations and IMF simultaneously, and an alternative spectral-fitting method
that does not assume a star-formation history (SFH; although does not constrain the IMF) for comparison.
When no SFH is assumed, we derived a negative metallicity gradient for IC 1459 that could be driven
by a distinct metal-poor population in the outer regions of the galaxy, and a radially constant old
stellar age. We found a radially constant bottom-heavy IMF out to $\sim \frac{1}{3} R_{\rm e}$.
The radially flat IMF and age extend beyond the counter-rotating core. We detected high velocity
dispersion along the galaxy's major axis. Our results potentially add weight to findings from orbital
modelling of other KDCs that the core is not a distinct population of stars but in fact two smooth co-spatial
counter-rotating populations. No clear picture of formation explains the observational results
of IC 1459, but we propose it could have included a gas-rich intense period of star formation at early
times, perhaps with counter-rotating accreting cold streams, followed by dry and gas-rich mergers
through to the present day.
