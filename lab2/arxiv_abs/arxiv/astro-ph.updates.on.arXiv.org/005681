We present new ALMA CO(2--1) observations of two well studied group-centered elliptical galaxies:
NGC~4636 and NGC~5846. In addition, we include a revised analysis of Cycle 0 ALMA observations of
the central galaxy in the NGC~5044 group that has been previously published. We find evidence that
molecular gas, in the form of off-center orbiting clouds, is a common presence in bright group-centered
galaxies (BGG). CO line widths are $\gtrsim 10$ times broader than Galactic molecular clouds, and
using the reference Milky Way $X_{CO}$, the total molecular mass ranges from as low as $2.6\times
10^5 M_\odot$ in NGC~4636 to $6.1\times 10^7 M_\odot$ in NGC~5044. With these parameters the virial
parameters of the molecular structures is $\gg 1$. Complementary observations of NGC~5846 and
NGC~4636 using the ALMA Compact Array (ACA) do not exhibit any detection of a CO diffuse component
at the sensitivity level achieved by current exposures. The origin of the detected molecular features
is still uncertain, but these ALMA observations suggest that they are the end product of the hot gas
cooling process and not the result of merger events. Some of the molecular clouds are associated
with dust features as revealed by HST dust extinction maps suggesting that these clouds formed from
dust-enhanced cooling. The global nonlinear condensation may be triggered via the chaotic turbulent
field or buoyant uplift. The large virial parameter of the molecular structures and correlation
with the warm ($10^3 - 10^5 K$)/hot ($\ge10^6$) phase velocity dispersion provide evidence that
they are unbound giant molecular associations drifting in the turbulent field, consistently with
numerical predictions of the chaotic cold accretion process. Alternatively, the observed large
CO line widths may be generated by molecular gas flowing out from cloud surfaces due to heating by
the local hot gas atmosphere.
