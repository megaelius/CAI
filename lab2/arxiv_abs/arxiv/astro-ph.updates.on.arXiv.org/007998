Fragmentation of highly differentially rotating massive stars that undergo collapse has been
suggested as a possible channel for binary black hole formation. Such a scenario could explain the
formation of the new population of massive black holes detected by the LIGO/VIRGO gravitational
wave laser interferometers. We probe that scenario by performing general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of differentially rotating massive stars supported by thermal radiation pressure
domination plus a gas pressure perturbation. The stars are initially threaded by a dynamically
weak, poloidal magnetic field confined to the stellar interior. We find that magnetic braking and
turbulent viscous damping via magnetic winding and the magnetorotational instability in the bulk
of the star redistribute angular momentum, damp differential rotation and induce the formation
of a massive and nearly uniformly rotating inner core surrounded by a Keplerian envelope. The core
+ disk configuration evolves on a secular timescale and remains in quasi-stationary equilibrium
until the termination of our simulations. Our results suggest that the high degree of differential
rotation required for $m=2$ seed density perturbations to trigger gas fragmentation and binary
black formation is likely to be suppressed during the normal lifetime of the star prior to evolving
to the point of dynamical instability to collapse. Other cataclysmic events, such as stellar mergers
leading to collapse, may therefore be necessary to reestablish sufficient differential rotation
and density perturbations to drive nonaxisymmetric modes leading to binary black hole formation.
