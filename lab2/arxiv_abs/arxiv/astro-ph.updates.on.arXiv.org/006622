Efficient prediction of solar flares relies on parameters that quantify the eruptive capability
of solar active regions. Several such quantitative predictors have been proposed in the literature,
inferred mostly from photospheric magnetograms and/or white-light observations. Two of them
are the Ising energy and the sum of the total horizontal magnetic field gradient. The former has been
developed from line-of-sight magnetograms, while the latter uses sunspot detections and characteristics,
based on continuum images. Aiming to include these parameters in an automated prediction scheme,
we test their applicability on regular photospheric magnetic field observations provided by the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).
We test their efficiency as predictors of flaring activity on a representative sample of active
regions and investigate possible modifications of these quantities. The Ising energy appears
to be an efficient predictor, and the efficiency is even improved if it is modified to describe interacting
magnetic partitions or sunspot umbrae. The sum of the horizontal magnetic field gradient appears
to be slightly more promising than the three variations of the Ising energy we implement in this article.
The new predictors are also compared with two very promising predictors: the effective connected
magnetic field strength and the total unsigned non-neutralized current. Our analysis shows that
the efficiency of morphological predictors depends on projection effects in a nontrivial way.
All four new predictors are found useful for inclusion in an automated flare forecasting facility,
such as the Flare Likelihood and Region Eruption Forecasting (FLARECAST), but their utility, among
others, will ultimately be determined by the validation effort underway in the framework of the
FLARECAST project.
