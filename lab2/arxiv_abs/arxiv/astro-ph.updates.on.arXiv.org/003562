AX J1745.6-2901 is a high-inclination (eclipsing) transient neutron star (NS) Low Mass X-ray Binary
(LMXB) showcasing intense ionised Fe K absorption. We present here the analysis of 11 XMM-Newton
and 15 NuSTAR new data-sets (obtained between 2013-2016), therefore tripling the number of observations
of AX J1745.6-2901 in outburst. Thanks to simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR spectra, we greatly
improve on the fitting of the X-ray continuum. During the soft state the emission can be described
by a disk black body ($kT\sim1.1-1.2$ keV and inner disc radius $r_{DBB}\sim14$ km), plus hot ($kT\sim2.2-3.0$
keV) black body radiation with a small emitting radius ($r_{BB}\sim0.5-0.8$ km) likely associated
with the boundary layer or NS surface, plus a faint Comptonisation component. Imprinted on the spectra
are clear absorption features created by both neutral and ionised matter. Additionally, positive
residuals suggestive of an emission Fe K$\alpha$ disc line and consistent with relativistic ionised
reflection are present during the soft state, while such residuals are not significant during the
hard state. The hard state spectra are characterised by a hard ($\Gamma\sim1.9-2.1$) power law,
showing no evidence for a high energy cut off ($kT_e>60-140$ keV) and implying a small optical depth
($\tau<1.6$). The new observations confirm the previously witnessed trend of exhibiting strong
Fe K absorption in the soft state, that significantly weakens during the hard state. Optical (GROND)
and radio (GMRT) observations suggest for AX J1745.6-2901 a standard broad band SED as typically
observed in accreting neutron stars.
