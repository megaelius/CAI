We search the Planck data for a thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) signal due to gas filaments between
pairs of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG's) taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12 (SDSS/DR12).
We identify $\sim$260,000 LRG pairs in the DR12 catalog that lie within 6-10 $h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}$
of each other in tangential direction and within 6 $h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}$ in radial direction. We
stack pairs by rotating and scaling the angular positions of each LRG so they lie on a common reference
frame, then we subtract a circularly symmetric halo from each member of the pair to search for a residual
signal between the pair members. We find a statistically significant (5.3$\sigma$) signal between
LRG pairs in the stacked data with a magnitude $\Delta y = (1.31 \pm 0.25) \times 10^{-8}$. The uncertainty
is estimated from two Monte Carlo null tests which also establish the reliability of our analysis.
Assuming a simple, isothermal, cylindrical filament model of electron over-density with a radial
density profile proportional to $r_c/r$ (as determined from simulations), where $r$ is the perpendicular
distance from the cylinder axis and $r_c$ is the core radius of the density profile, we constrain
the product of over-density and filament temperature to be $\delta_c \times (T_{\rm e}/10^7 \,
{\rm K}) \times (r_c/0.5h^{-1} \, {\rm Mpc}) = 2.7 \pm 0.5$. To our knowledge, this is the first detection
of filamentary gas at over-densities typical of cosmological large-scale structure. We compare
our result to the BAHAMAS suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (McCarthy et al. 2017)
and find a slightly lower, but marginally consistent Comptonization excess, $\Delta y = (0.84 \pm
0.24) \times 10^{-8}$.
