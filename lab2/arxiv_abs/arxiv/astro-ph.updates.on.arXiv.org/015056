Whether it is fluorescence emission from asteroids and moons, solar wind charge exchange from comets,
exospheric escape from Mars, pion reactions on Venus, sprite lighting on Saturn, or the Io plasma
torus in the Jovian magnetosphere, the Solar System is surprisingly rich and diverse in X-ray emitting
objects. The compositions of diverse planetary bodies are of fundamental interest to planetary
science, providing clues to the formation and evolutionary history of the target bodies and the
solar system as a whole. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) lines, triggered either by solar X-rays or energetic
ions, are intrinsic to atomic energy levels and carry an unambiguous signature of the elemental
composition of the emitting bodies. All remote-sensing XRF spectrometers used so far on planetary
orbiters have been collimated instruments, with limited achievable spatial resolution, and many
have used archaic X-ray detectors with poor energy resolution. Focusing X-ray optics provide true
spectroscopic imaging and are used widely in astrophysics missions, but until now their mass and
volume have been too large for resource-limited in-situ planetary missions. Recent advances in
X-ray instrumentation such as the Micro-Pore Optics used on the BepiColombo X-ray instrument (Fraser
et al., 2010), Miniature X-ray Optics (Hong et al., 2016) and highly radiation tolerant CMOS X-ray
sensors (e.g., Kenter et al., 2012) enable compact, yet powerful, truly focusing X-ray Imaging
Spectrometers. Such instruments will enable compositional measurements of planetary bodies
with much better spatial resolution and thus open a large new discovery space in planetary science,
greatly enhancing our understanding of the nature and origin of diverse planetary bodies. Here,
we discuss many examples of the power of XRF to address key science questions across the solar system.
