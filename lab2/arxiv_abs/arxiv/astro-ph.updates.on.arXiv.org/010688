Eclipsing binaries (EBs) are unique targets for measuring precise stellar properties and constrain
stellar evolution models. In particular, it is possible to measure at the percent level masses and
radii of both components of a double-lined spectroscopic EB. Since the advent of high-precision
photometric space missions (MOST, CoRoT, Kepler, BRITE, TESS), the use of stellar pulsation properties
to infer stellar interiors and dynamics constitutes a revolution for low-mass star studies. The
Kepler mission has led to the discovery of thousands of classical pulsators such as $\delta$ Scuti
and solar-like oscillators (main sequence and evolved), but also almost 3000 EBs with orbital periods
shorter than 1100 days. We report the first systematic search for stellar pulsators in the entire
Kepler eclipsing binary catalog. The focus is mainly aimed at discovering $\delta$ Scuti, $\gamma$
Doradus, red giant, and tidally excited pulsators. We developed a data inspection tool (DIT) that
automatically produces a series of plots from the Kepler light-curves that allows us to visually
identify whether stellar oscillations are present in a given time series. We applied the DIT to the
whole Kepler eclipsing binary database and identified 303 systems whose light curves display oscillations,
including 163 new discoveries. A total of 149 stars are flagged as $\delta$ Scuti (100 from this paper),
115 stars as $\gamma$ Doradus (69 new), 85 stars as red giants (27 new), 59 as tidally excited oscillators
(29 new). There is some overlap among these groups, as some display several types of oscillations.
Despite many of these systems are likely to be false positives, i. e., when an EB light curve is blended
with a pulsator, this catalog gathers a vast sample of systems that are valuable for a better understanding
of stellar evolution.
