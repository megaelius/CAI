We explore the connections between the evolving galaxy and AGN populations. We present a simple
phenomenological model that links the evolving galaxy mass function and the evolving quasar luminosity
function, motivated by similarities between the two, which makes specific and testable predictions
for the distribution of host galaxy masses for AGN of different luminosities. We show that the phi$^{*}$
normalisations of the galaxy mass function and the AGN luminosity function closely track each other
over a wide range of redshifts, implying a constant "duty cycle" of AGN activity. The strong redshift
evolution in the AGN break luminosity $L^*$ is produced by either an evolution in the distribution
of Eddington rations, or in the $m_{bh}/m_{*}$ mass ratio, or both. An evolving $m_{bh}/m_{*}$
ratio, such that it is ten times higher at $z \sim 2$ (i.e. roughly following $(1+z)^{2}$), reproduces
the observed distribution of SDSS quasars in the ($m_{bh},L$) plane and accounts for the apparent
"sub-Eddington boundary" without new physics and also satisfactorily reproduces the local relations
which connect the black hole population with the host galaxies for both quenched and star-forming
galaxies. The model produces the appearance of "downsizing" without any mass-dependence in the
evolution of black hole growth rates (Eddington ratios) and enables a quantitative assessment
of the strong biasses present in luminosity-selected AGN samples. The constant duty cycle is only
consistent with the idea that AGN trigger the quenching of star-formation in galaxies if the lifetime
of the AGN phase satisfies a particular mass and redshift dependence.
