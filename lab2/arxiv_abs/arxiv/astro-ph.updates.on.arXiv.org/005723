The Palatini formalism is developed for gravitational theories in flat geometries. We focus on
two particularly interesting scenarios. First, we fix the connection to be metric compatible,
but we follow a completely covariant approach by imposing the constraints with suitable Lagrange
multipliers. For a general quadratic theory we show how torsion naturally propagates and we reproduce
the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity as a particular quadratic action that features
an additional Lorentz symmetry. We then study the much less explored theories formulated in a geometry
with neither curvature nor torsion, so that all the geometrical information is encoded in the non-metricity.
We discuss how this geometrical framework leads to a purely inertial connection that can thus be
completely removed by a coordinate gauge choice, the coincident gauge. From the quadratic theory
we recover a simpler formulation of General Relativity in the form of the Einstein action, which
enjoys an enhanced symmetry that reduces to a second linearised diffeomorphism at linear order.
More general theories in both geometries can be formulated consistently by taking into account
the inertial connection and the associated additional degrees of freedom. As immediate applications,
the new cosmological equations and their Newtonian limit are considered, where the role of the lapse
in the consistency of the equations is clarified, and the Schwarzschild black hole entropy is computed
by evaluating the corresponding Euclidean action. We discuss how the boundary terms in the usual
formulation of General Relativity are related to different choices of coordinates in its coincident
version and show that in isotropic coordinates the Euclidean action is finite without the need to
introduce boundary or normalisation terms.
