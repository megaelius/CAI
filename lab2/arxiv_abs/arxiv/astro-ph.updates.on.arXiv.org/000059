Galaxy mergers are considered as questionable mechanisms for the evolution of lenticular galaxies
(S0's), on the basis that even minor ones induce structural changes that are difficult to reconcile
with the strong bulge-disk coupling observed in the photometric scaling relations of S0's. We check
if the evolution induced onto S0's by dry intermediate and minor mergers can reproduce their photometric
scaling relations, analysing the bulge-disk decompositions of the merger simulations presented
in Eliche-Moral et al. (2012). The mergers induce an evolution in the photometric planes compatible
with the data of S0's, even in those ones indicating a strong bulge-disk coupling. The mergers drive
the formation of the observed photometric relation in some cases, whereas they induce a slight dispersion
compatible with data in others. Therefore, this evolutionary mechanism tends to preserve these
scaling relations. In those photometric planes where the morphological types segregate, the mergers
always induce evolution towards the region populated by S0's. The structural coupling of the bulge
and the disk is preserved or reinforced because the mergers trigger internal secular processes
in the primary disk that induce significant bulge growth, even although these models do not induce
bars. Intermediate and minor mergers can thus be considered as plausible mechanisms for the evolution
of S0's attending to their photometric scaling relations, as they can preserve and even strengthen
any pre-existing structural bulge-disk coupling, triggering significant internal secular evolution
(even in the absence of bars or dissipational effects). This means that it may be difficult to isolate
the effects of pure internal secular evolution from those of the merger-driven one in present-day
early-type disks (abridged).
