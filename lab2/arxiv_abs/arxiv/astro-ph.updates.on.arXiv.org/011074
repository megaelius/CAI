We report a 3D MHD simulation study of the interactions between radio galaxies and galaxy-cluster-media
shocks in which the incident shock normals are orthogonal to the bipolar AGN jets. Before shock impact,
light, supersonic jets inflate lobes (cavities) in a static, uniform ICM. We examine three AGN activity
scenarios: 1) continued, steady jet activity; 2) jet source cycled off coincident with shock/radio
lobe impact; 3) jet activity ceased well before shock arrival (a "radio phoenix" scenario). The
simulations follow relativistic electrons (CRe) introduced by the jets, enabling synthetic radio
synchrotron images and spectra. Such encounters can be decomposed into an abrupt shock transition
and a subsequent long term post shock wind. Shock impact disrupts the pre-formed, low density RG
cavities into two ring vortices embedded in the post shock wind. Dynamical processes cause the vortex
pair to merge as they propagate downwind somewhat faster than the wind itself. When the AGN jets remain
active ram pressure bends the jets downwind, generating a narrow angle tail morphology aligned
with the axis of the vortex ring. The deflected jets do not significantly alter dynamical evolution
of the vortex ring. However, active jets and their associated tails do dominate the synchrotron
emission, compromising the observability of the vortex structures. Downwind-directed momentum
concentrated by the jets impacts and alters the post-encounter shock. In the "radio phoenix" scenario,
no DSA of the fossil electron population is required to account for the observed brightening and
flattening of the spectra, adiabatic compression effects are sufficient.
