Stage IV lensing surveys promise to make available an unprecedented amount of excellent data which
will represent a huge leap in terms of both quantity and quality. This will open the way to the use of
novel tools, which go beyond the standard second order statistics probing the high order properties
of the convergence field. We discuss the use of Minkowski Functionals (MFs) as complementary probes
to increase the lensing Figure of Merit (FoM), for a survey made out of a wide total area $A_{\rm{tot}}$
imaged at a limiting magnitude $\rm{mag_{W}}$ containing a subset of area $A_{\rm{deep}}$ where
observations are pushed to a deeper limiting magnitude $\rm{mag_{D}}$. We present an updated procedure
to match the theoretically predicted MFs to the measured ones, taking into account the impact of
map reconstruction from noisy shear data. We validate this renewed method against simulated data
sets with different source redshift distributions and total number density, setting these quantities
in accordance with the depth of the survey. We can then rely on a Fisher matrix analysis to forecast
the improvement in the FoM due to the joint use of shear tomography and MFs under different assumptions
on $(A_{\rm{tot}},\,A_{\rm{deep}},\,\rm{mag_{D}})$, and the prior on the MFs nuisance parameters.
It turns out that MFs can provide a valuable help in increasing the FoM of the lensing survey, provided
the nuisance parameters are known with a non negligible precision. What is actually more interesting
is the possibility to compensate for the loss of FoM due to a cut in the multipole range probed by shear
tomography, which makes the results more robust against uncertainties in the modeling of nonlinearities.
This makes MFs a promising tool to both increase the FoM and make the constraints on the cosmological
parameters less affected by theoretical systematic effects.
