On the AGB, low to intermediate mass stars blow away their outer envelopes, forming planetary nebulae.
Interaction between the planetary nebula and its central progenitor is poorly understood and even
more complex when the central object is a binary star with a magnetically active component, like
it is the case for IN Com. We aim to quantify the surface activity of the cool binary component of IN
Com and aim to explain its origin. We need a better understanding of how central binary stars in planetary
nebulae evolve and how this evolution could develop such magnetically active stars like IN Com.
We present 13 Doppler images covering six months in 2017 and use them to measure the surface differential
rotation. Hitherto unpublished photometric data from between 1989-2017 are presented. We apply
Fourier-transformation to both photometry and spectra. Very high resolution spectra are used
to update IN Com's astrophysical parameters by means of spectral synthesis. Doppler images show
cool and warm spots coexisting with an average surface temperature contrast of -1000K and +300K
with respect to the effective temperature. Approximately 8% of the surface is covered with cool
spots and 3% with warm spots. A cool polar spot is seen in all images. We found anti-solar surface differential
rotation with a shear coefficient of -0.026+/-0.005 and an equatorial rotation period of 5.973+/-0.008
d. We reconfirm the 5.9-day rotation period of the cool star from photometry, radial velocities,
and H alpha line-profile variations. A long-term V-brightness variation with a likely period of
7.2yr is found. It appears in phase with the orbital radial velocity of the binary system in the sense
brightest at highest velocity and faintest at lowest velocity. We redetermine [Ba/Fe], [Y/Fe]
and [Sr/Fe] ratios and confirm the overabundance of these s-process elements in the atmosphere
of IN Com.
