Atmospheric turbulence and precise measurement of the astrometric baseline vector between any
two telescopes are two major challenges in implementing phase referenced interferometric astrometry
and imaging. They limit the performance of a fibre-fed interferometer by degrading the instrument
sensitivity and astrometric measurements precision and by introducing image reconstruction
errors due to inaccurate phases. A multiple beam acquisition and guiding camera was built to meet
these challenges for a recently commissioned four beam combiner instrument, GRAVITY, at the ESO
Very Large Telescope Interferometer. For each telescope beam it measures: a) field tip-tilts by
imaging stars in the sky; b) telescope pupil shifts by imaging pupil reference laser beacons installed
on each telescope using a $2 \times 2$ lenslet; c) higher order aberrations using a $9 \times 9$ Shack-Hartmann.
The telescope pupils are imaged for a visual monitoring while observing. These measurements enable
active field and pupil guiding by actuating a train of tip-tilt mirrors placed in the pupil and field
planes, respectively. The Shack-Hartmann measured quasi-static aberrations are used to focus
the Auxiliary Telescopes and allow the possibility of correcting the non-common path errors between
the Unit Telescopes adaptive optics systems and GRAVITY. The guiding stabilizes light injection
into single-mode fibres, increasing sensitivity and reducing the astrometric and image reconstruction
errors. The beam guiding enables to achieve astrometric error less than $50\,\mu$as. Here, we report
on the data reduction methods and laboratory tests of the multiple beam acquisition and guiding
camera and its performance on-sky.
