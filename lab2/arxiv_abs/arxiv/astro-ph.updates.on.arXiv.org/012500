The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is expected to revolutionize the field of exoplanets. The
broad wavelength coverage and the high sensitivity of its instruments will allow characterization
of exoplanetary atmospheres with unprecedented precision. Following the Call for the Cycle 1 Early
Release Science Program, the Transiting Exoplanet Community was awarded time to observe several
targets, including WASP-43b. The atmosphere of this hot Jupiter has been intensively observed
but still harbors some mysteries, especially concerning the day-night temperature gradient,
the efficiency of the atmospheric circulation, and the presence of nightside clouds. We will constrain
these properties by observing a full orbit of the planet and extracting its spectroscopic phase
curve in the 5--12 $\mu$m range with JWST/MIRI. To prepare for these observations, we performed
an extensive modeling work with various codes: radiative transfer, chemical kinetics, cloud microphysics,
global circulation models, JWST simulators, and spectral retrieval. Our JWST simulations show
that we should achieve a precision of 210 ppm per 0.1 $\mu$m spectral bin on average, which will allow
us to measure the variations of the spectrum in longitude and measure the night-side emission spectrum
for the first time. If the atmosphere of WASP-43b is clear, our observations will permit us to determine
if its atmosphere has an equilibrium or disequilibrium chemical composition, providing eventually
the first conclusive evidence of chemical quenching in a hot Jupiter atmosphere. If the atmosphere
is cloudy, a careful retrieval analysis will allow us to identify the cloud composition.
