(abridged) We present the Significant Cosmic Holes in Universe (SCHU) method for identifying cosmic
voids and loops of filaments in cosmological datasets and assigning their statistical significance
using techniques from topological data analysis. Persistent homology is used to find different
dimensional holes. For dark matter halo catalogs and galaxy surveys, the 0-, 1-, and 2-dimensional
holes can be identified with clusters, loops of filaments, and voids. The procedure overlays halos/galaxies
on a 3D grid, and a distance-to-measure (DTM) function is calculated at each point of the grid. A filtration
is generated over the lower-level sets of the DTM across increasing threshold values. The filtered
simplicial complex can be used to summarize the birth/death times of the different dimension homology
group generators (i.e., the holes). Persistence diagrams are produced from the dimension and birth/death
times of each homology group generator. Using the persistence diagrams and bootstrap sampling,
we explain how $p$-values can be assigned to each homology group generator. The homology group generators
on a persistence diagram are not, in general, uniquely located back in the original dataset volume
so we propose a method for finding a representation of the homology group generators. This method
provides a novel, statistically rigorous approach for locating informative generators in cosmological
datasets, which may be useful for providing complementary cosmological constraints on the effects
of, for example, the sum of the neutrino masses. The method is tested on a Voronoi foam simulation,
and then applied to a subset of the SDSS galaxy survey and a cosmological simulation. Lastly, we calculate
Betti functions for two of the MassiveNuS simulations and discuss implications for using the persistent
homology of the density field to help break degeneracy in the cosmological parameters.
