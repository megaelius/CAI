Since the discovery of the transiting super-Earth CoRoT-7b, several investigations have yielded
different results for the number and masses of planets present in the system, mainly owing to the
star's high level of activity. We re-observed CoRoT-7 in January 2012 with both HARPS and CoRoT,
so that we now have the benefit of simultaneous radial-velocity and photometric data. This allows
us to use the off-transit variations in the star's light curve to estimate the radial-velocity variations
induced by the suppression of convective blueshift and the flux blocked by starspots. To account
for activity-related effects in the radial-velocities which do not have a photometric signature,
we also include an additional activity term in the radial-velocity model, which we treat as a Gaussian
process with the same covariance properties (and hence the same frequency structure) as the light
curve. Our model was incorporated into a Monte Carlo Markov Chain in order to make a precise determination
of the orbits of CoRoT-7b and CoRoT-7c. We measure the masses of planets b and c to be 4.73 +/- 0.95 Mearth
and 13.56 +/- 1.08 Mearth, respectively. The density of CoRoT-7b is (6.61 +/- 1.72)(Rp/1.58 Rearth)^(-3)
g.cm^(-3), which is compatible with a rocky composition. We search for evidence of an additional
planet d, identified by previous authors with a period close to 9 days. We are not able to confirm the
existence of a planet with this orbital period, which is close to the second harmonic of the stellar
rotation at around 7.9 days. Using Bayesian model selection we find that a model with two planets
plus activity-induced variations is most favoured.
