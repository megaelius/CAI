We have improved further the error sensitive Richardson-Lucy deconvolution algorithm making
it applicable directly on the un-binned measured angular power spectrum of Cosmic Microwave Background
observations to reconstruct the form of the primordial power spectrum. This improvement makes
the application of the method very much straight forward by cutting some intermediate stages of
analysis allowing us to reconstruct the form of the primordial spectrum with higher efficiency
and precision and with lower computational expenses. Applying the modified algorithm we have been
able to fit the WMAP 9 year data using the optimized reconstructed form of the primordial spectrum
with more than 300 improvement in \chi^2 with respect to the best fit power-law. This is clearly beyond
the reach of other alternative approaches and reflects the efficiency of the proposed method in
the reconstruction process and allow us to look for any possible feature in the primordial spectrum
projected in the CMB data. Though the proposed method allow us to look at various possibilities for
the form of the primordial spectrum, all having good fit to the data, proper error-analysis is needed
to test for consistency of theoretical models. Reconstructed error-band for the form of the primordial
spectrum using many realizations of the data, all bootstrapped and based on WMAP 9 year data, shows
proper consistency of power-law form of the primordial spectrum with the WMAP 9 data at all wave numbers.
Including WMAP polarization data in to the analysis have not improved much our results due to its
low quality but we expect Planck data will allow us to make a full analysis on CMB observations on both
temperature and polarization separately and in combination.
