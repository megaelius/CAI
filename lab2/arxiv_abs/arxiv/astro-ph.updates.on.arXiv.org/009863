Aims: The long-term carbon cycle for planets with a surface entirely covered by oceans works differently
from that of the present-day Earth because inefficient erosion leads to a strong dependence of the
weathering rate on the rate of volcanism. In this paper, we investigate the long-term carbon cycle
for these planets throughout their evolution. Methods: We built box models of the long-term carbon
cycle based on CO$_2$ degassing, seafloor-weathering, metamorphic decarbonation, and ingassing
and coupled them with thermal evolution models of stagnant lid and plate tectonics planets. Results:
The assumed relationship between the seafloor-weathering rate and the atmospheric CO$_2$ or the
surface temperature strongly influences the climate evolution for both tectonic regimes. For
a plate tectonics planet, the atmospheric CO$_2$ partial pressure is characterised by an equilibrium
between ingassing and degassing and depends on the temperature gradient in subduction zones affecting
the stability of carbonates. For a stagnant lid planet, partial melting and degassing are always
accompanied by decarbonation, such that the combined carbon content of the crust and atmosphere
increases with time. Whereas the initial mantle temperature for plate tectonics planets only affects
the early evolution, it influences the evolution of the surface temperature of stagnant lid planets
for much longer. Conclusions: For both tectonic regimes, mantle cooling results in a decreasing
atmospheric CO$_2$ partial pressure. For a plate tectonics planet this is caused by an increasing
fraction of subduction zones that avoid crustal decarbonation, and for stagnant lid planets this
is caused by an increasing decarbonation depth. This mechanism may partly compensate for the increase
of the surface temperature due to increasing solar luminosity with time and hereby contribute to
keep planets habitable in the long-term.
