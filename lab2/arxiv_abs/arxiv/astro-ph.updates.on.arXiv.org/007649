We present a sample of 17 objects from the CALIFA survey where we find initial evidence of galactic
winds based on their off-axis ionization properties. We identify the presence of outflows using
various optical diagnostic diagrams (e.g., EW(H$\alpha$), [Nii]/H$\alpha$, [Sii]/H$\alpha$,
[Oi]/H$\alpha$ line-ratio maps). We find that all 17 candidate outflow galaxies lie along the sequence
of active star formation in the M$_\star$ vs. star-formation rate diagram, without a clear excess
in the integrated SFR. The location of galaxies along the star-formation main sequence (SFMS) does
not influence strongly the presence or not of outflows. The analysis of the star-formation rate
density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) reveals that the CALIFA sources present higher values when compared
with normal star-forming galaxies. The strength of this relation depends on the calibrator used
to estimate the SFR. This excess in $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ is significant within the first effective
radius supporting the idea that most outflows are driven by processes in the inner regions of a galaxy.
We find that the molecular gas mass density ($\Sigma_\mathrm{gas}$) is a key parameter that plays
an important role in the generation of outflows through its association with the local SFR. The canonical
threshold reported for the generation of outflows -- $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}>0.1$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot
\mathrm{yr}^{-1} \mathrm{kpc}^{-2}$ -- is only marginally exceeded in our sample. Within the
Kennicutt-Schmidt diagram we propose a domain for galaxies hosting starburst-driven outflows
defined by $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}>10^{-2} \,\mathrm{M}_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1} \mathrm{kpc}^{-2}$
and $\Sigma_\mathrm{gas}>10^{1.2} \, \mathrm{M}_\odot \mathrm{pc}^{-2}$ within a central
kiloparcec region.
