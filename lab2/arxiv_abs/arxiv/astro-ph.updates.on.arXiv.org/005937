A substantial fraction of our solar system's trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are in mean motion
resonance with Neptune. Many of these objects were likely caught into resonances by planetary migration---either
smooth or stochastic---approximately 4 Gyr ago. Some, however, gravitationally scattered off
of Neptune and became transiently stuck in more recent events. Here, we use numerical simulations
to predict the number of transiently-stuck objects, captured from the current actively scattering
population, that occupy 111 resonances at semimajor axes $a=$30--100 au. Our source population
is an observationally constrained model of the currently-scattering TNOs. We predict that, integrated
across all resonances at these distances, the current transient sticking population comprises
40\% of total transiently-stuck+scattering TNOs, suggesting that these objects should be treated
as a single population. We compute the relative distribution of transiently-stuck objects across
all $p$:$q$ resonances with $1/6 \le q/p < 1$, $p<40$, and $q<20$, providing predictions for the
population of transient objects with $H_r < 8.66$ in each resonance. We find that the relative populations
are approximately proportional to each resonance's libration period and confirm that the importance
of transient sticking increases with semimajor axis in the studied range. We calculate the expected
distribution of libration amplitudes for stuck objects and demonstrate that observational constraints
indicate that both the total number and the amplitude-distribution of 5:2 resonant TNOs are inconsistent
with a population dominated by transient sticking from the current scattering disk. The 5:2 resonance
hence poses a challenge for leading theories of Kuiper belt sculpting.
