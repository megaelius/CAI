We present a systematic phase curve analysis of known transiting systems observed by the Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite during Year 1 of the Primary Mission. Using theoretical predictions
for the amplitude of the planetary longitudinal atmospheric brightness modulation, stellar ellipsoidal
distortion and Doppler boosting, as well as brightness considerations to select targets with likely
detectable signals, we applied a uniform data processing and light curve modeling framework to
fit the full-orbit phase curves of 19 transiting systems with planet-mass or brown dwarf companions.
Statistically significant secondary eclipse depths and/or atmospheric brightness modulation
amplitudes were measured for HIP 65A, WASP-72, WASP-100, WASP-111, and WASP-122/KELT-14. For
WASP-100b, we found marginal evidence that the brightest region of the atmosphere is shifted eastward
by $14\overset{\circ}{.}2\pm4\overset{\circ}{.}6$ away from the substellar point. We found
significant ellipsoidal distortion signals in the light curves of HIP 65A, TOI-503, and WASP-30,
with TOI-503 also exhibiting Doppler boosting. The measured amplitudes of these signals agree
with the predictions of theoretical models. From our light curve fits, we also measured updated
and refined orbital ephemerides and transit shape parameters. Combining the optical secondary
eclipse depths with previously published Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m measurements, we derived dayside
brightness temperatures and visible-light geometric albedos for a subset of the analyzed systems.
We find a tentative correlation between increasing dayside temperature and increasing geometric
albedo in the TESS bandpass, suggesting enhanced atmospheric reflectivity and/or additional
opacity sources contributing to the visible-light flux for planets with $T_{\mathrm{day}}>2200$
