The Sun constitutes an excellent laboratory of fundamental physics. With the advent of helioseismology,
we were able to probe its internal layers with unprecedented precision. However, the current state
of solar modelling is still stained by tedious issues. One of these problems is related to the disagreement
between models computed with recent photospheric abundances and helioseismic constraints. We
use solar evolutionary models as initial conditions for reintegrations of their structure using
Ledoux discriminant inversions. The resulting models are defined as seismic solar models, satisfying
the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium. They will allow us to better constrain the internal structure
of the Sun and provide complementary information to that of evolutionary models. These seismic
models were computed using various reference models with different equations of state, abundances
and opacity tables. We check the robustness of our approach by confirming the good agreement of our
seismic models in terms of sound speed, density and entropy proxy inversions as well as frequency-separation
ratios of low-degree pressure modes. Our method allows us to determine with an excellent accuracy
the Ledoux discriminant profile of the Sun and compute full profiles of this quantity. Our models
show an agreement with seismic data of ~0.1% in sound speed, density and entropy proxy as well as with
the observed frequency-separation ratios. They surpass all standard and non-standard evolutionary
models including ad-hoc changes aiming at reproducing helioseismic constraints. The obtained
seismic Ledoux discriminant profile as well as the consistent structure obtained from our procedure
paves the way for renewed attempts at constraining the solar modelling problem and the missing physical
processes acting in the solar interior by breaking free from the hypotheses of evolutionary models.
