Context: Vertically hydrostatic protoplanetary disk models are based on the assumption that the
main heating source, stellar irradiation, does not vary much with time. However, it is known that
accreting young stars are variable sources of radiation. This is particularly evident for outbursting
sources such as EX Lupi and FU Orionis stars. Aim: We investigate how such outbursts affect the vertical
structure of the outer regions of the protoplanetary disk, in particular their appearance in scattered
light at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Methods: We employ the 3D FARGOCA radiation-hydrodynamics
code, in polar coordinates, to compute the time-dependent behavior of the axisymmetric disk structure.
The outbursting inner disk region is not included explicitly. Instead, its luminosity is added
to the stellar luminosity and is thus included in the irradiation of the outer disk regions. For time
snapshots of interest we insert the density structure into the RADMC-3D radiative transfer code
and compute the appearance of the disk at optical/near-infrared wavelengths. Results: We find
that, depending on the amplitude of the outbursts, the vertical structure of the disk can become
highly dynamic, featuring circular surface waves of considerable amplitude. These "hills" and
"valleys" on the disk's surface show up in the scattered light images as bright and dark concentric
rings. Initially these rings are small and act as standing waves, but they subsequently lead to outward
propagating waves, like the waves produced by a stone thrown into a pond. These waves continue long
after the actual outburst has died out. Conclusions: We propose that some of the multi-ringed structures
seen in optical/infrared images of several protoplanetary disks may have their origin in outbursts
that occurred decades or centuries ago.
