Based on their stellar parameters and the presence of a mid-IR excess due to circumstellar dust,
RV Tauri stars have been classified as post-AGB stars. Our recent studies, however, reveal diverse
SEDs among RV Tauri stars, suggesting they may occupy other evolutionary channels as well. The aim
of this paper is to present the diverse SED characteristics of RV Tauri stars and investigate their
evolutionary nature as a function of their SEDs. We carried out a systematic study of RV Tauri stars
in the SMC and LMC because of their known distances and hence luminosities. Their SEDs were classified
in three groups: dusty (disc-type), non-dusty (non-IR) and uncertain. A period-luminosity- colour
(PLC) relation was calibrated. The luminosities from the PLC were complemented with the ones found
using their SEDs and the stars were placed on the HR-diagram. The four main results from this study
are: 1) RV Tauri stars with a clear IR-excess have disc-type SEDs, which indicates that the dust is
trapped in a stable disc. Given the strong link between disc-type SEDs and binarity in the Galaxy,
we postulate that these are binaries as well. These cover a range of luminosities and we argue that
the more luminous ones are post-AGB stars while the lower luminosity ones are likely post-Red Giant
Branch (post-RGB) stars. 2) Two of these objects have variable mean brightness with periods of 916
and 850 days, respectively, caused by variable extinction during orbital motion. 3) The non-dusty
RV Tauri stars and the objects with an uncertain SED evolve such that the circumstellar dust has dispersed.
If they are single stars, they are post-AGB objects of low initial mass ($<$ 1.25 M$_\odot$), while
if they are binaries, the low-luminosity part of the sample are likely post-RGB stars. 4) We find
that RV Tauri stars with dust are on average more luminous than the rest of the sample.
