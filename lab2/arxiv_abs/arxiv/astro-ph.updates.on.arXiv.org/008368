We present a morphological and physical analysis of a Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC) using the carbon
monoxide isotopologues ($^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O $^{3}P_{2}\rightarrow$ $^{3}P_{1}$)
survey of the Galactic Plane (Mopra CO Southern Galactic Plane Survey), supplemented with neutral
carbon maps from the HEAT telescope in Antarctica. The giant molecular cloud structure (hereinafter
the ring) covers the sky region $332^\circ$ < $\ell$ < $333^\circ$ and $\mathit{b}$ = $\pm 0.5^\circ$
(hereinafter the G332 region). The mass of the ring and its distance are determined to be respectively
~2$\times10^{5}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and ~3.7 kpc from Sun. The dark molecular gas fraction, estimated
from the $^{13}$CO and [CI] lines, is $\sim17\%$ for a CO T$_{\mathrm{ex}}$ between [10,20 K]. Comparing
the [CI] integrated intensity and N(H$_{2}$) traced by $^{13}$CO and $^{12}$CO, we define an X$\mathrm{_{CI}^{809}}$
factor, analogous to the usual X$_{\mathrm{co}}$, through the [CI] line. X$\mathrm{_{CI}^{809}}$
ranges between [1.8,2.0]$\times10^{21}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{K}^{-1}\mathrm{km}^{-1}\mathrm{s}$.
We examined local variation in X$_{\mathrm{co}}$ and T$_{\mathrm{ex}}$ across the cloud, and
find in regions where the star formation activity is not in an advanced state, an increase in the mean
and dispersion of the X$_{\mathrm{co}}$ factor as the excitation temperature decreases. We present
a catalogue of C$^{18}$O clumps within the cloud. The star formation (SF) activity ongoing in the
cloud shows a correlation with T$_{\mathrm{ex}}$, [CI] and CO emissions, and anti-correlation
with X$_{\mathrm{co}}$, suggesting a North-South spatial gradient in the SF activity. We propose
a method to disentangle dust emission across the Galaxy, using HI and $^{13}$CO data. We describe
Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) data visualisation techniques for the analysis
of radio astronomy data.
