We measured carbon abundances and the $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$ ratio in 31 giant branch
stars with previous CN and CH band measurements that span -2.33 $<$ M$_{\rm V}$ $<$ 0.18 in the globular
cluster M10 (NGC 6254). Abundances were determined by comparing CO features at $\sim 2.3\, \mu \mathrm{m}$
and specifically the $^{13}$CO bandhead at $2.37\, \mu \mathrm{m}$, to synthetic spectra generated
with MOOG. The observed spectra were obtained with GNIRS on Gemini North with a resolution of R $\approx
3500$. The carbon abundances derived from the IR spectra agree with previous [C/Fe] measurements
found using CN and CH features at the near-UV/blue wavelength range. We found an average carbon isotope
ratio of $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$ = 5.10$_{-0.17}^{+0.18}$ for first generation
stars (CN-normal; 13 stars total) and $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$ = 4.84$_{-0.22}^{+0.27}$
for second generation stars (CN-enhanced; 15 stars). We therefore find no statistically significant
difference in $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$ ratio between stars in either population for
the observed magnitude range. Finally, we created models of the expected carbon, nitrogen, and
$^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$ surface abundance evolution on the red giant branch due to
thermohaline mixing using the MESA stellar evolution code. The efficiency of the thermohaline
mixing must be increased to a factor of $\approx 60$ to match [C/Fe] abundances, and by a factor of
$\approx 666$ to match $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$ ratios. We could not simultaneously
fit the evolution of both carbon and the $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}$ ratio with models
using the same thermohaline efficiency parameter.
