We search for transiting exoplanets around the star $\beta$ Pictoris using high resolution spectroscopy
and Doppler imaging that removes the need for standard star observations. These data were obtained
on the VLT with UVES during the course of an observing campaign throughout 2017 that monitored the
Hill sphere transit of the exoplanet $\beta$ Pictoris b. We utilize line profile tomography as a
method for the discovery of transiting exoplanets. By measuring the exoplanet distortion of the
stellar line profile, we remove the need for reference star measurements. We demonstrate the method
with white noise simulations, and then look at the case of $\beta$ Pictoris, which is a $\delta$ Scuti
pulsator. We describe a method to remove the stellar pulsations and perform a search for any transiting
exoplanets in the resultant data set. We inject fake planet transits with varying orbital periods
and planet radii into the spectra and determine the recovery fraction. In the photon noise limited
case we can recover planets down to a Neptune radius with an $\sim$80% success rate, using an 8 m telescope
with a $R\sim 100,000$ spectrograph and 20 minutes of observations per night. The pulsations of
$\beta$ Pictoris limit our sensitivity to Jupiter-sized planets, but a pulsation removal algorithm
improves this limit to Saturn-sized planets. We present two planet candidates, but argue that their
signals are most likely caused by other phenomena. We have demonstrated a method for searching for
transiting exoplanets that (i) does not require ancillary calibration observations, (ii) can
work on any star whose rotational broadening can be resolved with a high spectral dispersion spectrograph
and (iii) provides the lowest limits so far on the radii of transiting Jupiter-sized exoplanets
around $\beta$ Pictoris with orbital periods from 15 days to 200 days with >50% coverage.
