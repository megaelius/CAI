Previous investigations of Saturn's outer D ring (73,200-74,000 km from Saturn's center) identified
periodic brightness variations whose radial wavenumber increased linearly over time. This pattern
was attributed to a vertical corrugation, and its temporal variability implied that some event
--possibly an impact with interplanetary debris-- caused the ring to become tilted out the planet's
equatorial plane in 1983. This work examines these patterns in greater detail using a more extensive
set of Cassini images in order to obtain additional insights into the 1983 event. These additional
data reveal that the D ring is not only corrugated, but also contains a time-variable periodic modulation
in its optical depth that probably represents organized eccentric motions of the D-ring's particles.
This second pattern suggests that whatever event tilted the rings also disturbed the radial or azimuthal
velocities of the ring particles. Furthermore, the relative amplitudes of the two patterns indicate
that the vertical motions induced by the 1983 event were 2.3+/-0.5 times larger than the corresponding
in-plane motions. If these structures were indeed produced by an impact, material would need to
strike the ring at a steep angle (more than 60 degrees from the ring plane) to produce such motions.
Meanwhile, the corrugation wavelengths in the D ring are about 0.7% shorter than one would predict
based on extrapolations from similar structures in the nearby C ring. This could indicate that the
D-ring was tilted/disturbed about 60 days before the C ring. Such a timing difference could be explained
if the debris striking the rings was derived from an object that broke apart in Saturn's atmosphere,
producing debris with a substantial initial velocity dispersion whose orbital properties were
subsequently perturbed by solar tides prior to collision with the rings.
