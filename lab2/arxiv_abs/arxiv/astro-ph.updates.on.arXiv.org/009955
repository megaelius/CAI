We derive dust masses ($M_{\rm dust}$) from the spectral energy distributions of 58 post-starburst
galaxies (PSBs). There is an anticorrelation between specific dust mass ($M_{\rm dust}$/$M_{\star}$)
and the time elapsed since the starburst ended, indicating that dust was either destroyed, expelled,
or rendered undetectable over the $\sim$1 Gyr after the burst. The $M_{\rm dust}$/$M_{\star}$
depletion timescale, 205$^{+58}_{-37}$ Myr, is consistent with that of the CO-traced $M_{\rm
H_2}/M_{\star}$, suggesting that dust and gas are altered via the same process. Extrapolating
these trends leads to the $M_{\rm dust}/M_{\star}$ and $M_{\rm H_2}/M_{\star}$ values of early-type
galaxies (ETGs) within 1-2 Gyr, a timescale consistent with the evolution of other PSB properties
into ETGs. Comparing $M_{\rm dust}$ and $M_{\rm H_2}$ for PSBs yields a calibration, log $M_{\rm
H_2}$ = 0.45 log $M_{\rm dust}$ + 6.02, that allows us to place 33 PSBs on the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS)
plane, $\Sigma \rm SFR-\Sigma M_{\rm H_2}$. Over the first $\sim$200-300 Myr, the PSBs evolve down
and off of the KS relation, as their star formation rate (SFR) decreases more rapidly than $M_{\rm
H_2}$. Afterwards, $M_{\rm H_2}$ continues to decline whereas the SFR levels off. These trends
suggest that the star-formation efficiency bottoms out at 10$^{-11}\ \rm yr^{-1}$ and will rise
to ETG levels within 0.5-1.1 Gyr afterwards. The SFR decline after the burst is likely due to the absence
of gas denser than the CO-traced H$_2$. The mechanism of the $M_{\rm dust}/M_{\star}$ and$M_{\rm
H_2}/M_{\star}$ decline, whose timescale suggests active galactic nucleus (AGN) or low-ionization
nuclear emission-line region (LINER) feedback, may also be preventing the large CO-traced molecular
gas reservoirs from collapsing and forming denser star forming clouds.
