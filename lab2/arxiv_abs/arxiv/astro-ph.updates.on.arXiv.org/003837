(Abridged) We present the first APOKASC catalog of spectroscopic and asteroseismic data for 415
dwarfs and subgiants. Asteroseismic data have been obtained by Kepler in short cadence. The spectroscopic
parameters are based on spectra taken as part of APOGEE and correspond to DR13 of SDSS. We analyze
our data using two Teff scales, the spectroscopic values from DR13 and those derived from SDSS \emph{griz}
photometry. We use the differences in our results arising from these choices as a test of systematic
Teff, and find that they can lead to significant differences in the derived stellar properties.
Determinations of surface gravity ($\log{g}$), mean density ($\rho$), radius ($R$), mass ($M$),
and age ($\tau$) for the whole sample have been carried out with stellar grid-based modeling. We
have assessed random and systematic error sources in the spectroscopic and seismic data, as well
as in the grid-based modeling determination of the stellar quantities in the catalog. We provide
stellar properties for both Teff scales. The median combined (random and systematic) uncertainties
are 2% (0.01 dex; $\log{g}$), 3.4% ($\rho$), 2.6% ($R$), 5.1% ($M$), and 19% ($\tau$) for the photometric
Teff scale and 2% ($\log{g}$), 3.5% ($\rho$), 2.7% ($R$), 6.3% ($M$), and 23% ($\tau$) for the spectroscopic
scale. Comparisons with stellar quantities in the catalog by Chaplin et al. (2014) highlight the
importance of metallicity measurements for determining stellar parameters accurately. We also
compare our results with those from other sources, including stellar radii determined from TGAS
parallaxes and asteroseismic analyses based on individual frequencies. We find a very good agreement
in all cases. The latter comparison, in particular, gives a strong support to the determination
of stellar quantities based on global seismology, a relevant result for future missions such as
TESS and PLATO.
