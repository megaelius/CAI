We present a new technique for the determination of the low-mass slope ($\alpha_1$; $M_* < 0.5
M_{\odot}$) of the present day stellar mass function (PDMF) using the pixel space fitting of integrated
light spectra. It can be used to constrain the initial mass function (IMF) of stellar systems with
relaxation timescales exceeding the Hubble time and testing the IMF universality hypothesis.
We provide two versions of the technique: (1) a fully unconstrained determination of the age, metallicity,
and $\alpha_1$ and (2) a constrained fitting by imposing the externally determined mass-to-light
ratio of the stellar population. We have tested our approach by Monte-Carlo simulations using mock
spectra and conclude that: (a) age, metallicity and $\alpha_1$ can be precisely determined by applying
the unconstrained version of the code to high signal-to-noise datasets (S/N=100, R=7000 yield
$\Delta \alpha_1 \approx 0.1$); (b) the $M/L$ constraint significantly improves the precision
and reduces the degeneracies, however its systematic errors will cause biased $\alpha_1$ estimates;
(c) standard Lick indices cannot constrain the PDMF because they miss most of the mass function sensitive
spectral features; (d) the $\alpha_1$ determination remains unaffected by the high-mass IMF shape
($\alpha_3$; $M_* \ge 1 M_{\odot}$) variation for stellar systems older than 8 Gyr, while the intermediate-mass
IMF slope ($\alpha_2$; $0.5 \le M_* < 1 M_{\odot}$) may introduce biases into the best-fitting
$\alpha_1$ values if it is different from the canonical value $\alpha_2 = 2.3$. We analysed observed
intermediate resolution spectra of ultracompact dwarf galaxies with our technique and demonstrated
its applicability to real data.
