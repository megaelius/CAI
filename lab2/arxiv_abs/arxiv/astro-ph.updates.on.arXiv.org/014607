We report novel cosmological constraints obtained from cosmic voids in the final BOSS DR12 dataset.
They arise from the joint analysis of geometric and dynamic distortions of average void shapes (i.e.,
the stacked void-galaxy cross-correlation function) in redshift space. Our model uses tomographic
deprojection to infer real-space void profiles and self-consistently accounts for the Alcock-Paczynski
(AP) effect and redshift-space distortions (RSD) without any prior assumptions on cosmology or
structure formation. It is derived from first physical principles and provides an extremely good
description of the data at linear perturbation order. We validate this model with the help of mock
catalogs and apply it to the final BOSS data to constrain the RSD and AP parameters $f/b$ and $D_AH/c$,
where $f$ is the linear growth rate, $b$ the linear galaxy bias, $D_A$ the comoving angular diameter
distance, $H$ the Hubble rate, and $c$ the speed of light. In addition, we include two nuisance parameters
in our analysis to marginalize over potential systematics. We obtain $f/b=0.540\pm0.091$ and
$D_AH/c=0.588\pm0.004$ from the full void sample at a mean redshift of $z=0.51$. In a flat $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology, this implies $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.312\pm0.020$ for the present-day matter density
parameter. When we use additional information from the survey mocks to calibrate our model, these
constraints improve to $f/b=0.347\pm0.023$, $D_AH/c=0.588\pm0.003$, and $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.311\pm0.019$.
However, we emphasize that the calibration depends on the specific model of cosmology and structure
formation assumed in the mocks, so the calibrated results should be considered less robust. Nevertheless,
our calibration-independent constraints are among the tightest of their kind to date, demonstrating
the immense potential of using cosmic voids for cosmology in current and future data.
