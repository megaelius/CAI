We simulate the star cluster, made of stars in the main sequence and different black hole (BH) remnants,
around SgrA* at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Tracking stellar evolution, we find the BH remnant
masses and construct the BH mass function. We sample 4 BH species and consider the impact of the mass-function
in the dynamical evolution of system. Starting from an initial 6 dimensional family of parameters
and using an MCMC approach, we find the best fits to various parameters of model by directly comparing
the results of the simulations after $t = 10.5$ Gyrs with current observations of the stellar surface
density, stellar mass profile and the mass of SgrA*. Using these parameters, we study the dynamical
evolution of system in detail. We also explore the mass-growth of SgrA* due to tidally disrupted
stars and swallowed BHs. We show that the consumed mass is dominated for the BH component with larger
initial normalization as given by the BH mass-function. Assuming that about 10% of the tidally disrupted
stars contribute in the growth of SgrA* mass, stars make up the second dominant effect in enhancing
the mass of SgrA*. We consider the detectability of the GW signal from inspiralling stellar mass
BHs around SgrA* with LISA. Computing the fraction of the lifetime of every BH species in the LISA
band, with signal to noise ratio $\gtrsim 8$, to their entire lifetime, and rescaling this number
with the total number of BHs in the system, we find that the total expected rate of inspirals per Milky-Way
sized galaxy per year is $10^{-5}$. Quite interestingly, the rate is dominated for the BH component
with larger initial normalization as dictated by the BH mass-function. We interpret it as the second
signature of the BH mass-function.
