The X-ray, Ultraviolet, Optical emission from radio-quiet AGNs, black hole binaries, and other
compact sources, in general, follow a lognormal flux distribution, a linear rms-flux relation,
and a (broken) power-law power spectral densities (PSDs). These characteristics are normally
attributed to the multiplicative combination of fluctuations in the accretion disk. Similar features
have been inferred for some well-observed blazars in different energy bands, but a systematic study
over a long duration is still missing. Using a continuous gamma-ray light curves over 3-days cadence
from August 2008 - October 2015, we present the first systematic study of these features in four sources:
the FR I radio galaxy NGC 1275 and three blazars- Mrk 421, B2 1520+31 and PKS 1510-089. For all, except
Mrk 421, the flux spans $\gtrsim$ 2 orders of magnitude. For blazars, a log-normal profile describes
the flux histograms better compared to a Gaussian, while none is favored for NGC 1275, the only non-blazar
source, suggesting a complex distribution. Regardless of flux histogram profile, the rms-flux
relation is linear for all with PSDs being consistent with a power-law shot noise spectrum despite
hints of breaks. The inferred results are consistent with the properties of unresolved magnetic
reconnection sites, as inferred in the X-ray emission from the whole Solar disk and the statistical
characteristics of magnetic reconnection based minijets-in-a-jet model. The results, thus,
suggest a strong jet-accretion-disk coupling with energy input from the central source being distributed
over a wide range in time and energy by the reconnection process depending on the geometry and local
physical conditions.
