We discuss properties of Alfv\'enic fluctuations with large amplitude in plasmas characterised
by low magnetic field compression. We note that in such systems power laws can not develop with arbitrarily
steep slopes at large scales, i.e. when $|\delta \bf{B}|$ becomes of the order of the background
field $|\bf{B}|$. In such systems there is a scale $l_0$ at which the spectrum has to break due to the
condition of weak compressibility. A very good example of this dynamics is offered by solar wind
fluctuations in Alfv\'enic fast streams, characterised by the property of constant field magnitude.
We show here that the distribution of $\delta B=|\delta \bf{B}|$ in the fast wind displays a strong
cut-off at $\delta B/|{\bf B}|\lesssim2$, as expected for fluctuations bounded on a sphere of radius
$B=|{\bf B}|$. This is also associated with a saturation of the rms of the fluctuations at large scales
and introduces a specific length $l_0$ above which the amplitude of the fluctuations becomes independent
on the scale $l$. Consistent with that, the power spectrum at $l>l_0$ is characterised by a -1 spectral
slope, as expected for fluctuations that are scale-independent. Moreover, we show that the spectral
break between the 1/f and inertial range in solar wind spectra indeed corresponds to the scale $l_0$
at which $\left<\delta B/B\right>\sim1$. Such a simple model provides a possible alternative
explanation of magnetic spectra observed in interplanetary space, also pointing out the inconsistency
for a plasma to simultaneously maintain $|\bf{B}|\sim$const. at arbitrarily large scales and
satisfy a Kolmogorov scaling.
