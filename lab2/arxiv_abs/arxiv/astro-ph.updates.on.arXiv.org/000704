The spatial segregation between dSphs and dIrrs in the Local Group has long been regarded as evidence
of an interaction with their host galaxies. In this paper, we assume that ram-pressure stripping
is the dominant mechanism that removed gas from the dSphs and we use this to derive a lower bound on
the density of the corona of the Milky Way at large distances (50-90 kpc) from the Galactic centre.
At the same time, we derive an upper bound by demanding that the interstellar medium of the dSphs is
in pressure equilibrium with the hot corona. We consider two dwarfs (Sextans and Carina) with well-determined
orbits and star formation histories. Our approach introduces several novel features: we use the
measured star formation histories of the dwarfs to derive the time at which they last lost their gas,
and (via a modified version of the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation) their internal gas density at that
time; we use a large suite of 2D hydrodynamical simulations to model the gas stripping; and we include
supernova feedback tied to the gas content. Despite having very different orbits and star formation
histories, we find results for the two dSphs that are in excellent agreement with one another. We
derive an average particle density of the corona of the Milky Way at 50-90 kpc in the range 1.3-3.6
10^{-4} cm^{-3}. Including additional constraints from X-ray emission limits and pulsar dispersion
measurements, we extrapolate Galactic coronal density profiles and we estimate the fraction of
baryons that can exist within the virial radius of the Milky Way. For an isothermal corona (T=1.8
10^6 K) this is small, 10-20 % of the universal baryon fraction. Only a hot (T=3 10^6 K) and adiabatic
corona can contain all of the Galaxy's missing baryons. Models for the Milky Way must explain why
its corona is in a hot adiabatic thermal state or why a large fraction of its baryons lie beyond the
virial radius.
