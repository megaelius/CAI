Quiescent solar prominences are observed to exist within the solar atmosphere for up to several
solar rotations. Their eruption is commonly preceded by a slow increase in height that can last from
hours to days. This increase in the prominence height is believed to be due to their host magnetic
flux rope transitioning through a series of neighbouring quasi-equilibria before the main loss-of-equilibrium
that drives the eruption. Recent work suggests that the removal of prominence mass from a stable,
quiescent flux rope is one possible cause for this change in height. However, these conclusions
are drawn from observations and are subject to interpretation. Here we present a simple model to
quantify the effect of "mass-draining" during the pre-eruptive height-evolution of a solar flux
rope. The flux rope is modeled as a line current suspended within a background potential magnetic
field. We first show that the inclusion of mass, up to $10^{12}$~kg, can modify the height at which
the line current experiences loss-of-equilibrium by up to 14\%. Next, we show that the rapid removal
of mass prior to the loss-of-equilibrium can allow the height of the flux rope to increase sharply
and without upper bound as it approaches its loss-of-equilibrium point. This indicates that the
critical height for the loss-of-equilibrium can occur at a range of heights depending explicitly
on the amount and evolution of mass within the flux rope. Finally, we demonstrate that for the same
amount of drained mass, the effect on the height of the flux rope is up to two order of magnitude larger
for quiescent than for active region prominences.
