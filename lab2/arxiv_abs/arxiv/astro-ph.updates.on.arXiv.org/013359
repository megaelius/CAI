Broad-band images of the solar chromosphere in the Ca II H&K line cores around active regions are
covered with fine bright elongated structures called bright fibrils. The mechanisms that form
these structures and cause them to appear bright are still unknown. We aim to investigate the physical
properties, such as temperature, line-of-sight velocity, and microturbulence, in the atmosphere
that produces bright fibrils and to compare those to the properties of their surrounding atmosphere.
We used simultaneous observations of a plage region in Fe I 6301-2 \r{A}, Ca II 8542 \r{A}, Ca II K,
and H$\alpha$ acquired by the CRISP and CHROMIS instruments on the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope.
We manually selected a sample of 282 Ca II K bright fibrils. We compared the appearance of the fibrils
in our sample to the Ca II 8542 \r{A} and H$\alpha$ data. We performed non-local thermodynamic equilibrium
(non-LTE) inversions using the inversion code STiC on the Fe I 6301-2 \r{A}, Ca II 8542 \r{A}, Ca II
K lines to infer the physical properties of the atmosphere. The line profiles in bright fibrils have
a higher intensity in their K$_2$ peaks compared to profiles formed in the surrounding atmosphere.
The inversion results show that the atmosphere in fibrils is on average $100-200$~K hotter at an
optical depth log$(\tau) = -4.3$ compared to their surroundings. The line-of-sight velocity at
chromospheric heights in the fibrils does not show any preference towards upflows or downflows.
The microturbulence in the fibrils is on average 0.5 km s$^{-1}$ higher compared to their surroundings.
Our results suggest that the fibrils have a limited extent in height, and they should be viewed as
hot threads pervading the chromosphere.
