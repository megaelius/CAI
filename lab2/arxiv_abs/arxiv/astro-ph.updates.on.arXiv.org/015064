The connection between star formation rate (SFR) and dark matter (DM) is of paramount importance
to extract cosmological information from next generation spectroscopic surveys like DESI, Euclid
and Roman-space telescope, that will target emission line galaxies. We use a set of publicly available
mock galaxy catalogs obtained by applying different semi-analytic models (SAMs) to DM-only numerical
simulations to explore this connection, search for environmental dependencies and assess their
impact on the Speed-from-Light Method (SfLM) to measure the growth rate, $f$ from luminosity/SFR
shifts. Despite the considerable scatter among SAM predictions, robust conclusions can be drawn:
a) Quiescent galaxies are more clustered relative to the DM than the star forming ones from $z=1$
to the present epoch, b) The linear bias factor, $b$, defined as the clustering ratio of galaxies
to DM, is roughly a scale-independent, constant function of the SFR for star forming galaxies. Its
value at $z=1$ ranges from $1.2$ to $1.5$ depending on the SAM recipe, c) Denser environments are
associated with higher stellar masses, $M_*$, and d) For the majority of the models the SFR probability
distribution is skewed to larger values in denser regions. Only one model exhibits an $inverted$
trend where high SFR is suppressed in galaxies in dense environment. We confirm that the application
of the SfLM to an Euclid-like survey will not be biased by environmental effects. The expected precision
on the measured $\beta=f/b$ parameter is $\sigma_\beta < 0.17$ at $z=1$. This translates into errors
of $\sigma_f \sim 0.22$ and $\sigma_{f\sigma_8}\sim 0.1$, respectively, without invoking any
assumptions on the mass power spectrum. These errors are in the same ballpark as the most recent analyses
of the redshift space distortions in galaxy clustering.
