A pathfinder version of CHIME (the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment) is currently
being commissioned at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO) in Penticton, BC. The
instrument is a hybrid cylindrical interferometer designed to measure the large scale neutral
hydrogen power spectrum across the redshift range 0.8 to 2.5. The power spectrum will be used to measure
the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale across this poorly probed redshift range where dark
energy becomes a significant contributor to the evolution of the Universe. The instrument revives
the cylinder design in radio astronomy with a wide field survey as a primary goal. Modern low-noise
amplifiers and digital processing remove the necessity for the analog beamforming that characterized
previous designs. The Pathfinder consists of two cylinders 37\,m long by 20\,m wide oriented north-south
for a total collecting area of 1,500 square meters. The cylinders are stationary with no moving parts,
and form a transit instrument with an instantaneous field of view of $\sim$100\,degrees by 1-2\,degrees.
Each CHIME Pathfinder cylinder has a feedline with 64 dual polarization feeds placed every $\sim$30\,cm
which Nyquist sample the north-south sky over much of the frequency band. The signals from each dual-polarization
feed are independently amplified, filtered to 400-800\,MHz, and directly sampled at 800\,MSps
using 8 bits. The correlator is an FX design, where the Fourier transform channelization is performed
in FPGAs, which are interfaced to a set of GPUs that compute the correlation matrix. The CHIME Pathfinder
is a 1/10th scale prototype version of CHIME and is designed to detect the BAO feature and constrain
the distance-redshift relation.
