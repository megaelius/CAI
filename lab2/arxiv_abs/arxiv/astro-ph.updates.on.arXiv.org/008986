PSR B0919+06 is known for its abnormal emission phenomenon, where the pulse emission window occasionally
shifts progressively in longitude and returns afterwards. The physical mechanism behind this
phenomenon is still under investigation. In this paper, we present our ultra-wideband observation
of this pulsar using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), with simultaneous
measurements in the frequency ranges 280-780 MHz and 1250-1550 MHz. We have identified three abnormal
events, each of which becomes less apparent as the frequency decreases. At 1400 MHz, the averaged
profile slightly shifted after the first and third abnormal events, implying a relationship between
abnormal event and profile variation. We also found a linear trend in the left-edge position of the
averaged profiles between the first and third event as well as after the third event, suggesting
the existence of a slow-drifting mode between the two major events. The second event has a comparatively
small shift in phase and is thus categorized as a `small flare state'. During the third event, a sequence
of approximately nine pulses was seen to significantly weaken in all frequency bands, likely associated
with the pseudo-nulling observed at 150 MHz. A three-component de-composition analysis of the
normal averaged profiles shows that the trailing component is dominant at our observing frequencies,
while the centre component has a comparatively steeper spectrum. We found the overall flux density
in an abnormal event to slightly differ from that in an ordinary state, and the difference shows a
frequency dependence. A comparison of the normal, abnormal and dimmed averaged profile indicates
that the leading component is likely to be stable in all states.
