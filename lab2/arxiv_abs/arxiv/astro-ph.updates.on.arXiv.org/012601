Several papers have recently suggested the possible presence of a ninth planet (Planet X) that might
explain the gravitational perturbations of a number of detached Trans-Neptunian objects. To analyze
the possibility further, we have applied celestial mechanics, engineering physics and statistical
analysis to develop improved estimates of the planet's primary orbital elements and mass from first
engineering principles, using the orbital characteristics of both the original group of 6 objects
analyzed and also a second group comprising the original 6 together with 6 additional long-period
asteroids selected by the authors. We show that the driving force behind the observed clustering
is gravitational torque that arranges the orbits of asteroids in a systematic, orderly manner,
and we develop the associated equations of motion. As evidence we show that the expected effects
are fully apparent in the orbital characteristics of the correlated bodies involved, including
most strikingly regarding their orbital planes, azimuth orientations and specific relative angular
momenta, which we show generates a highly unexpected form of resonance in their relative angular
momenta. We further show that the coordinates of Planet 9's orbit are close to the original values
proposed recently by other authors, although we prove that its period has to be dramatically smaller
than that proposed in recent literature by Batygin and Brown, 2019, at about 3500 yrs, the eccentricity
is near 0.65, and its mass approximately 8.4 times the Earth's mass. Given the predicted orbit we
show that the planet has apparently created numerous mean motion resonances, of which seven are
noted specifically. As for a possible observation, Planet X, would range between V=18.9 and 26.1,
probably with a magnitude of about 24.8.
