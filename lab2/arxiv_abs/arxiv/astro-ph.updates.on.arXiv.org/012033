We present a catalog of 208 $0.3 < z < 2.1$ Emission Line Galaxies (ELG) selected from 1D slitless spectroscopy
obtained using Hubble's WFC3 G102 grism, as part of the Faint Infrared Grism Survey (FIGS). We identify
ELG candidates by searching for significant peaks in all continuum-subtracted G102 spectra, and,
where possible, confirm candidates by identifying consistent emission lines in other available
spectra or with published spectroscopic redshifts. We provide derived emission line fluxes and
errors, redshifts, and equivalent widths (EW) for H$\alpha$ $\lambda6563$, [OIII]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$,
and [OII]$\lambda\lambda3727$ emission lines, for emission line galaxies down to AB(F105W) $
> 28$ and $> 10^{-17}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ line flux. We use the resulting line catalog to investigate
a possible relationship between line emission and a galaxy's environment. We use 7th-nearest-neighbor
distances to investigate the typical surroundings of ELGs compared to non-ELGs, and we find that
[OIII] emitters are preferentially found at intermediate galaxy densities near galaxy groups.
We characterize these ELGs in terms of the galaxy specific star formation rate (SSFR) versus stellar
mass, and find no significant influence of environment on that relation. We calculate star formation
rates (SFR), and find no dependence of SFR on local galaxy surface density for $0.3 < z < 0.8$ H$\alpha$
emitters and for $0.8<z<1.3$ [OIII] emitters. We find similar rates of close-pair interaction
between ELGs and non-ELGs. For galaxy surface densities $\Sigma \leq 30$ Mpc$^{-2}$, we find no
consistent effect of environment on star formation.
