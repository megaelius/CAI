Interpreting the oscillations of massive and intermediate mass stars remains a challenging task.
In fast rotators, the oscillation spectrum of p-modes is a superposition of sub-spectra which correspond
to different types of modes, among which island modes and chaotic modes are expected to be the most
visible. In the case of island modes, a semi-analytic formula describing the asymptotic behavior
of island modes has been obtained previously. We study the properties of high frequency chaotic
p-modes in a polytropic model. Unexpected peaks appear in the frequency autocorrelations of the
spectra. Our goal is to find a physical interpretation for these peaks and also to provide an overview
of the mode properties. We use the 2D oscillation code TOP to produce the modes and acoustic ray simulations
to explore the wave properties in the asymptotic regime. Using the tools developed in the field of
quantum chaos (or wave chaos), we derive an expression for the frequency autocorrelation involving
the travel time of acoustic rays. Chaotic mode spectra were previously thought to be irregular,
i. e. described only through their statistical properties. Our analysis shows the existence, in
chaotic mode spectra, of a pseudo large separation. This means that chaotic modes are organized
in series, such that the modes in each series follow a nearly regular frequency spacing. The pseudo
large separation of chaotic modes is very close to the large separation of island modes. Its value
is related to the sound speed averaged over the meridional plane of the star. In addition to the pseudo
large separation, other correlations appear in the numerically calculated spectra. We explain
their origin by the trapping of acoustic rays near the stable islands.
