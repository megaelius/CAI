Modern radio astronomical facilities are able to detect extremely weak electromagnetic signals
not only from the universe but also from man-made radio frequency interference of various origins.
These range from wanted signals to unwanted out-of-band emission of radio services and applications
to electromagnetic interference produced by all kinds of electronic and electric devices. Energy
harvesting wind turbines are not only equipped with electric power conversion hardware but also
copious amounts of electronics to control and monitor the turbines. A wind turbine in the vicinity
of a radio telescope could therefore lead to harmful interference, corrupting the measured astronomical
data. Many observatories seek to coordinate placement of new wind farms with wind turbine manufacturers
and operators, as well as with the local planning authorities, to avoid such a situation. In our study,
we provide examples as well as guidelines for the determination of the separation distances between
wind turbines and radio observatories, to enable a benign co-existence for both. The proposed calculations
entail three basic steps. At first, the anticipated maximum emitted power level based on the European
EN 550011 (CISPR-11) standard, which applies to industrial devices, is determined. Then secondly,
the propagation loss along the path to the radio receiver is computed via a model provided by the international
telecommunication union. Finally, the received power is compared to the permitted power limit
that pertains in the protected radio astronomical observing band under consideration. This procedure
may be carried out for each location around a telescope site, in order to obtain a map of potentially
problematic wind turbine positions.
