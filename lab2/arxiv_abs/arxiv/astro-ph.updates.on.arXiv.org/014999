We present observations of $^{12}$C$^{32}$S, $^{12}$C$^{34}$S, $^{13}$C$^{32}$S and $^{12}$C$^{33}$S
J=2$-$1 lines toward a large sample of massive star forming regions by using the Arizona Radio Observatory
12-m telescope and the IRAM\,30-m. Taking new measurements of the carbon $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio,
the $^{32}$S$/$$^{34}$S isotope ratio was determined from the integrated $^{13}$C$^{32}$S/$^{12}$C$^{34}$S
line intensity ratios for our sample. Our analysis shows a $^{32}$S$/$$^{34}$S gradient from the
inner Galaxy out to a galactocentric distance of 12\,kpc. An unweighted least-squares fit to our
data yields $^{32}$S$/$$^{34}$S = (1.56 $\pm$ 0.17)$\rm D_{\rm GC}$ + (6.75 $\pm$ 1.22) with a correlation
coefficient of 0.77. Errors represent 1$\sigma$ standard deviations. Testing this result by (a)
excluding the Galactic center region, (b) excluding all sources with C$^{34}$S opacities $>$ 0.25,
(c) combining our data and old data from previous study, and (d) using different sets of carbon isotope
ratios leads to the conclusion that the observed $^{32}$S$/$$^{34}$S gradient is not an artefact
but persists irrespective of the choice of the sample and carbon isotope data. A gradient with rising
$^{32}$S$/$$^{34}$S values as a function of galactocentric radius implies that the solar system
ratio should be larger than that of the local interstellar medium. With the new carbon isotope ratios
we obtain indeed a local $^{32}$S$/$$^{34}$S isotope ratio about 10$\%$ below the solar system
one, as expected in case of decreasing $^{32}$S$/$$^{34}$S ratios with time and increased amounts
of stellar processing. However, taking older carbon isotope ratios based on a lesser amount of data,
such a decrease is not seen. No systematic variation of $^{34}$S$/$$^{33}$S ratios along galactocentric
distance was found.
