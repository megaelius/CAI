Magnetic fields are expected to play an important role in accretion processes for circumstellar
disks. Measuring the magnetic field morphology is difficult, especially since polarimetric (sub)millimeter
continuum observations may not trace fields in most disks. The Goldreich-Kylafis (GK) effect suggests
that line polarization is perpendicular or parallel to the magnetic field direction. We attempt
to observe CO(2-1), $^{13}$CO(2-1), and C$^{18}$O(2-1) line polarization toward HD 142527 and
IM Lup, which are large, bright protoplanetary disks. We use spatial averaging and spectral integration
to search for signals in both disks, and detect a potential CO(2-1) Stokes $Q$ signal toward both
disks. The total CO(2-1) polarization fractions are 1.57 $\pm$ 0.18% and 1.01 $\pm$ 0.10% for HD
142527 and IM Lup, respectively. Our Monte Carlo simulations indicate that these signals are marginal.
We also stack Stokes parameters based on the Keplerian rotation, but no signal was found. Across
the disk traced by dust of HD 142527, the 3$\sigma$ upper limits for $P_{\text{frac}}$ at 0.5$^{\prime\prime}$
($\sim$80 au) resolution are typically less than 3% for CO(2-1) and $^{13}$CO(2-1) and 4% for C$^{18}$O(2-1).
For IM Lup, the 3$\sigma$ upper limits for these three lines are typically less than 3%, 4%, and 12%,
respectively. Upper limits based on our stacking technique are up to a factor of $\sim$10 lower,
though stacking areas can potentially average out small-scale polarization structure. We also
compare our continuum polarization at 1.3 mm to observations at 870 $\mu$m from previous studies.
The polarization in the northern dust trap of HD 142527 shows a significant change in morphology
and an increase in $P_{\text{frac}}$ as compared to 870 $\mu$m. For IM Lup, the 1.3 mm polarization
may be more azimuthal and has a higher $P_{\text{frac}}$ than at 870 $\mu$m.
