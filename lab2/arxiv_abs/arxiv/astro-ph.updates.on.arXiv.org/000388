We quantify the fraction of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) that originates from galaxies
identified in the UV/optical/near-infrared by stacking 81,250 (~35.7 arcmin^2) K-selected sources,
split according to their rest-frame U - V vs. V - J colors into 72,216 star-forming and 9,034 quiescent
galaxies, on maps from Spitzer/MIPS (24, 70, 160 {\mu}m), Herschel/SPIRE (250, 350, 500 {\mu}m),
and AzTEC (1100 {\mu}m). The fraction of the CIB resolved by our catalog is (67 \pm 16)% at 24 {\mu}m,
(72 \pm 17)% at 70 {\mu}m, (76 \pm 18)% at 160 {\mu}m, (78 \pm 18)% at 250 {\mu}m, (70 \pm 15)% at 350 {\mu}m,
(67 \pm 13)% at 500 {\mu}m, and (52 \pm 9)% at 1100 {\mu}m. Of that total, about 95% originates from
star-forming galaxies, while the remaining 5% is from apparently quiescent galaxies. The CIB at
{\lambda} < 200 {\mu}m appears to be sourced predominantly from galaxies at z < 1, while at
{\lambda} > 200 {\mu}m the bulk originates from 1 < z < 2. Galaxies with stellar masses log(M/
M_sun)=9.5-11 are responsible for the majority of the CIB, with those in the log(M/ M_sun)=9.5-10
contributing mostly at {\lambda} < 250{\mu}m, and those in the log(M/ M_sun)=10.5-11 jointly
dominating at {\lambda} > 350{\mu}m. The contribution from galaxies in the log(M/ M_sun)=9.0$-9.5
(highest) and log(M/ M_sun)=11.0-12.0 (lowest) stellar mass bins contribute the least, both of
order 5%. The luminosities of the galaxies responsible for the CIB shifts from a combination of "normal"
and luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) at \lambda < 160 {\mu}m, to being dominated by LIRGs at
longer wavelengths. Stacking analyses were performed using SIMSTACK, a novel algorithm designed
to account for possible biases in the stacked flux density due to clustering. It is made available
