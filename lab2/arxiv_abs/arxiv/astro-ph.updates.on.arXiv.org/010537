The most important factors determining solar coronal activity are believed to be the availability
of magnetic free energy and the constraint of magnetic helicity conservation. Direct measurements
of the helicity and magnetic free energy in the coronal volume are difficult, but their values may
be estimated from measurements of the helicity and free energy transport rates through the photosphere.
We examine these transport rates for a topologically open system such as the corona, in which the
magnetic fields have a nonzero normal component at the boundaries, and derive a new formula for the
helicity transport rate at the boundaries. In addition, we derive new expressions for helicity
transport due to flux emergence/submergence versus photospheric horizontal motions. The key
feature of our formulas is that they are manifestly gauge invariant. Our results are somewhat counterintuitive
in that only the lamellar electric field produced by the surface potential transports helicity
across boundaries, and the solenoidal electric field produced by a surface stream function does
not contribute to the helicity transport. We discuss the physical interpretation of this result.
Furthermore, we derive an expression for the free energy transport rate and show that a necessary
condition for free energy transport across a boundary is the presence of a closed magnetic field
at the surface, indicating that there are current systems within the volume. We discuss the implications
of these results for using photospheric vector magnetic and velocity field measurements to derive
the solar coronal helicity and magnetic free energy, which can then be used to constrain and drive
models for coronal activity.
