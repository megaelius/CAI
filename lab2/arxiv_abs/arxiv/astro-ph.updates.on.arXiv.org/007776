The transition between atomic and molecular hydrogen is associated with important changes in the
structure of interstellar clouds, and marks the beginning of interstellar chemistry. Because
of the relatively simple networks controlling their abundances, molecular ions are usually good
probes of the underlying physical conditions including for instance the fraction of gas in molecular
form or the fractional ionization. In this paper we focus on three possible probes of the molecular
hydrogen column density, HCO+, HOC+, and CF+. We presented high sensitivity ALMA absorption data
toward a sample of compact HII regions and bright QSOs with prominent foreground absorption, in
the ground state transitions of the molecular ions HCO+, HOC+, and CF+ and the neutral species HCN
and HNC, and from the excited state transitions of C3H+(4-3) and 13CS(2-1). These data are compared
with Herschel absorption spectra of the ground state transition of HF and p-H2O. We show that the
HCO+, HOC+, and CF+ column densities are well correlated with each other. HCO+ and HOC+ are tightly
correlated with p-H2O, while they exhibit a different correlation pattern with HF depending on
whether the absorbing matter is located in the Galactic disk or in the central molecular zone. We
report new detections of C3H+ confirming that this ion is ubiquitous in the diffuse matter, with
an abundance relative to H2 of ~7E-11. We confirm that the CF+ abundance is lower than predicted by
simple chemical models and propose that the rate of the main formation reaction is lower by a factor
of about 3 than usually assumed. In the absence of CH or HF data, we recommend to use the ground state
transitions of HCO+, CCH, and HOC+ to trace diffuse molecular hydrogen, with mean abundances relative
to H2 of 3E-9, 4E-8 and 4E-11.
