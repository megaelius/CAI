Galaxy assembly bias, the correlation between galaxy properties and halo properties at fixed halo
mass, could be an important ingredient in halo-based modelling of galaxy clustering. We investigate
the central galaxy assembly bias by studying the relation between various galaxy and halo properties
in the Illustris hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulation. Galaxy stellar mass $M_{star}$ is
found to have a tighter correlation with peak maximum halo circular velocity $V_{peak}$ than with
halo mass $M_h$. Once the correlation with $V_{peak}$ is accounted for, $M_{star}$ has nearly no
dependence on any other halo assembly variables. The correlations between galaxy properties related
to star formation history and halo assembly properties also show a cleaner form as a function of $V_{peak}$
than as a function of $M_h$, with the main correlation being with halo formation time and to a less
extent halo concentration. Based on the galaxy-halo relation, we present a simple model to relate
the bias factors of a central galaxy sample and the corresponding halo sample, both selected based
on assembly-related properties. It is found that they are connected by the correlation coefficient
of the galaxy and halo properties used to define the two samples, which provides a reasonable description
for the samples in the simulation and suggests a simple prescription to incorporate galaxy assembly
bias into the halo model. By applying the model to the local galaxy clustering measurements in Lin
et al.(2016), we infer that the correlation between star formation history or specific star formation
rate and halo formation time is consistent with being weak.
