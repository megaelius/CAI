We present an update of our on-going project to characterise the impact of radio jets on the ISM by
tracing molecular gas at high spatial resolution using ALMA. The radio active galactic nuclei (AGN)
studied show recently born radio jets. In this stage, the plasma jets can have the largest impact
on the ISM, as also predicted by state-of-the-art simulations. The two targets have quite different
ages, allowing us to get snapshots of the effects of radio jets as they grow. Interestingly, both
also host powerful quasar emission. The largest mass outflow rate of molecular gas is found in a radio
galaxy hosting a newly born radio jet emerging from an obscuring cocoon of gas and dust. Although
the mass outflow rate is high (few hundred Msun/yr), the outflow is limited to the inner few hundred
pc region. In a second object, the jet is larger (a few kpc) and is in a more advanced evolutionary phase.
In this object, the distribution of the molecular gas is reminiscent of what is seen, on larger scales,
in cool-core clusters hosting radio galaxies. Gas deviating from quiescent kinematics is not very
prominent, limited only to the very inner region, and has a low mass outflow rate. Instead, on kpc
scales, the radio lobes appear associated with depressions in the distribution of the molecular
gas, suggesting they have broken out from the dense nuclear region. The AGN does not appear to be able
at present to stop the star formation observed in this galaxy. These results suggest that the effects
of the radio source start in the first phases by producing outflows which, however, tend to be limited
to the kpc region. After that, the effects turn into producing large-scale bubbles which could,
in the long term, prevent the surrounding gas from cooling. Our results characterise the effect
of radio jets in different phases of their evolution, bridging the studies done for radio galaxies
in clusters.
