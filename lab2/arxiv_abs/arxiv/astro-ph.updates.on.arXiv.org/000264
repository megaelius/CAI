We describe a numerical scheme for studying time-dependent, multifluid, magnetohydrodynamic
shock waves in weakly ionized interstellar clouds and cores. Shocks are modeled as propagating
perpendicular to the magnetic field and consist of a neutral molecular fluid plus a fluid of ions
and electrons. The scheme is based on operator splitting, wherein time integration of the governing
equations is split into separate parts. In one part independent homogeneous Riemann problems for
the two fluids are solved using Godunov's method. In the other equations containing the source terms
for transfer of mass, momentum, and energy between the fluids are integrated using standard numerical
techniques. We show that, for the frequent case where the thermal pressures of the ions and electrons
are << magnetic pressure, the Riemann problems for the neutral and ion-electron fluids have
a similar mathematical structure which facilitates numerical coding. Implementation of the scheme
is discussed and several benchmark tests confirming its accuracy are presented, including (i)
MHD wave packets ranging over orders of magnitude in length and time scales; (ii) early evolution
of mulitfluid shocks caused by two colliding clouds; and (iii) a multifluid shock with mass transfer
between the fluids by cosmic-ray ionization and ion-electron recombination, demonstrating the
effect of ion mass loading on magnetic precursors of MHD shocks. An exact solution to a MHD Riemann
problem forming the basis for an approximate numerical solver used in the homogeneous part of our
scheme is presented, along with derivations of the analytic benchmark solutions and tests showing
the convergence of the numerical algorithm.
