While traditionally associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN), the properties of the CII] ($\lambda=2326$\,{\AA}),
CIII] ($\lambda,\lambda=1907,1909$\,{\AA}) and CIV ($\lambda,\lambda=1549, 1551$\,{\AA})
emission lines are still uncertain as large, unbiased samples of sources are scarce. We present
the first blind, statistical study of CII], CIII] and CIV emitters at $z\sim0.68,1.05,1.53$, respectively,
uniformly selected down to a flux limit of $\sim4\times10^{-17}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ through
a narrow band survey covering an area of $\sim1.4$ deg$^2$ over COSMOS and UDS. We detect 16 CII],
35 CIII] and 17 CIV emitters, whose nature we investigate using optical colours as well as HST, X-ray,
radio and far infra-red data. We find that $z\sim0.7$ CII] emitters are consistent with a mixture
of blue (UV slope $\beta=-2.0\pm0.4$) star forming galaxies with disky HST structure and AGN with
Seyfert-like morphologies. Bright CII] emitters have individual X-ray detections as well as high
average black hole accretion rates (BHAR) of $\sim0.1$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. CIII] emitters
at $z\sim1.05$ trace a general population of SF galaxies, with $\beta=-0.8\pm1.1$, a variety of
optical morphologies, including isolated and interacting galaxies and low BHAR ($<0.02$ $M_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$). Our CIV emitters at $z\sim1.5$ are consistent with young, blue quasars ($\beta\sim-1.9$)
with point-like optical morphologies, bright X-ray counterparts and large BHAR ($0.8$ $M_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$). We also find some surprising CII], CIII] and CIV emitters with rest-frame equivalent
widths which could be as large as $50-100$ {\AA}. AGN or spatial offsets between the UV continuum
stellar disk and the line emitting regions may explain the large EW. These bright CII], CIII] and
CIV emitters are ideal candidates for spectroscopic follow up to fully unveil their nature.
