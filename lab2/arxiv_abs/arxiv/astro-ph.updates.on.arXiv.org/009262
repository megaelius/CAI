We present a survey on the rotational and physical properties of the dynamically low inclination
Cold Classical trans-Neptunian objects. The Cold Classicals (CCs) are primordial planetesimals
and contain relevant information about the early phase of our Solar System and planet formation
over the first 100 million years after the formation of the Sun. Our project makes use of the Magellan
and the Lowell's Discovery Channel Telescopes for photometric purposes. We obtained partial/complete
lightcurves for 42 CCs. We use statistical tests to derive general properties about the shape and
rotational frequency distributions of the CC population, and infer that the CCs have slower rotations
and are more elongated/deformed than the other trans-Neptunian objects. Based on the available
full lightcurves, the mean rotational period of the CC population is 9.48$\pm$1.53h whereas the
mean period of the rest of the trans-Neptunian objects is 8.45$\pm$0.58h. About 65% of the trans-Neptunian
objects (excluding the CCs) have a lightcurve amplitude below 0.2mag compared to the 36% of CCs with
small amplitude. We present the full lightcurve of one new likely contact binary: 2004 VC131 with
a potential density of 1gcc for a mass ratio of 0.4. We also have hints that 2004 MU8 and 2004 VU75 are
maybe potential contact binaries based on their sparse lightcurves but more data are needed to confirm
such a find. Assuming equal-sized binaries, we find that only ~10-25% of the Cold Classicals could
be contact binaries, suggesting that there is a deficit of contact binaries in this population compared
to previous estimates and compared to the abundant (~40-50%) possible contact binaries in the 3:2
resonant population. This estimate is a lower limit and will increase if non equal-sized contact
binaries are also considered. Finally, we put in context the early results of the New Horizons flyby
of (486958) 2014 MU69.
