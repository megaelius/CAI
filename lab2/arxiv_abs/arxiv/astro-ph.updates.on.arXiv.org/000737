We have investigated the strength of ultraviolet Fe II emission from quasars within the environments
of Large Quasar Groups (LQGs) in comparison with quasars elsewhere, for 1.1 <= <z_LQG>
<= 1.7, using the DR7QSO catalogue of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We use the Weymann et al. W2400
equivalent width, defined between the rest-frame continuum-windows 2240-2255 and 2665-2695
Ang., as the measure of the UV Fe II emission. We find a significant shift of the W2400 distribution
to higher values for quasars within LQGs, predominantly for those LQGs with 1.1 <= <z_LQG>
<= 1.5. There is a tentative indication that the shift to higher values increases with the quasar
i magnitude. We find evidence that within LQGs the ultrastrong emitters with W2400 >= 45 Ang.
(more precisely, ultrastrong-plus with W2400 >= 44 Ang.) have preferred nearest-neighbour
separations of ~ 30-50 Mpc to the adjacent quasar of any W2400 strength. No such effect is seen for
the ultrastrong emitters that are not in LQGs. The possibilities for increasing the strength of
the Fe II emission appear to be iron abundance, Ly-alpha fluorescence, and microturbulence, and
probably all of these operate. The dense environment of the LQGs may have led to an increased rate
of star formation and an enhanced abundance of iron in the nuclei of galaxies. Similarly the dense
environment may have led to more active blackholes and increased Ly-alpha fluorescence. The preferred
nearest-neighbour separation for the stronger emitters would appear to suggest a dynamical component,
such as microturbulence. In one particular LQG, the Huge-LQG (the largest structure known in the
early universe), six of the seven strongest emitters very obviously form three pairings within
the total of 73 members.
