The empirical scaling relations observed in disk galaxies remain challenging for models of galaxy
formation. The most striking among these is the Mass Discrepancy-Acceleration Relation (MDAR),
which encodes both a tight baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR) and the observed diversity of
galaxy rotation curves through the central surface density relation (CSDR). Building on our earlier
work, we propose here that the MDAR is the result of interactions between baryons and 'Baryon-Interacting
Dark Matter' (BIDM), which heat up the dark matter. Following a bottom-up, hydrodynamical approach,
we find that the MDAR follows if: $i)$ the BIDM equation of state approximates that of an ideal gas;
$ii)$ the BIDM relaxation time is order the Jeans time; $iii)$ the heating rate is inversely proportional
to the BIDM density. Remarkably, under these assumptions the set of hydrodynamical equations together
with Poisson's equation enjoy an anisotropic scaling symmetry. In the BIDM-dominated regime,
this gives rise to an enhanced symmetry which fully captures the low-acceleration limit of the MDAR.
We then show that, assuming a cored pseudo-isothermal profile at equilibrium, this set of equations
gives rise to parameters reproducing the MDAR. Specifically, in the flat part of the rotation curve
the asymptotic rotational velocity matches the parametric dependence of the BTFR. Moreover, in
the central region of high-surface brightness galaxies, the profile reproduces the CSDR. Finally,
by studying the time-dependent approach to equilibrium, we derive a global combination of the BTFR
and CSDR, which matches the expectations in low surface-brightness galaxies. The form of the heating
rate also makes model-independent predictions for various cosmological observables. We argue
that our scenario satisfies existing observational constraints, and, intriguingly, offers a
possible explanation to the EDGES anomaly.
