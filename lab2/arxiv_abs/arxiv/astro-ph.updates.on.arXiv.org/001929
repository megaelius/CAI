Direct measurements of the core-collapse supernova rate in the redshift range 0<z 1 appear to
be about a factor of two smaller than the rate inferred from the measured cosmic massive-star formation
rate (SFR). We explore the possibility that one could clarify the source of this "supernova rate
problem" by detecting the energy spectrum of supernova relic neutrinos with a next generation detector
like Hyper-Kamiokande. We make an alternative compilation of the SFR data. We show that by only including
published SFR data for which the dust obscuration has been directly determined, the ratio of the
observed massive SFR to the observed supernova rate has large uncertainties$\sim 1.8^{+1.6}_{-0.6}$,
and is statistically consistent with no supernova rate problem. If we consider that a significant
fraction of massive stars end their lives as faint ONeMg SNe or as failed SNe, then the ratio reduces
to $\sim 1.1^{+1.0}_{-0.4}$ and the rate problem is solved. We study the sources of uncertainty
involved in estimates of the neutrino detection rate and analyze whether the spectrum of relic neutrinos
can be used to independently identify the existence of a supernova rate problem and its source. We
consider an ensemble of published and unpublished neutrino luminosities and temperatures from
core collapse supernova simulation models. We illustrate how the spectrum of detector events might
be used to constrain the average neutrino temperature and SN models. We study the effects of neutrino
oscillations on the detected neutrino spectrum and also analyze a possible enhanced contribution
from failed supernovae. We conclude that it might be possible to measure the neutrino temperature,
neutrino oscillations, the EOS, and confirm this source of missing luminous supernovae.
