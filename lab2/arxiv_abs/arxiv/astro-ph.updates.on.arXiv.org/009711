We present here the cosmo-SLICS, a new suite of simulations specially designed for the analysis
of current and upcoming weak lensing data beyond the standard two-point cosmic shear. We sample
the $[\Omega_{\rm m}, \sigma_8, h, w_0]$ parameter space at 25 points organised in a Latin hyper-cube,
spanning a range that contains most of the $2\sigma$ posterior distribution from ongoing lensing
surveys. At each of these nodes we evolve a pair of $N$-body simulations in which the sampling variance
is highly suppressed, and ray-trace the volumes 800 times to further increase the effective sky
coverage. We extract a lensing covariance matrix from these pseudo-independent light-cones and
show that it closely matches a brute-force construction based on an ensemble of 800 truly independent
$N$-body runs. More precisely, a Fisher analysis reveals that both methods yield marginalized
two-dimensional constraints that vary by less than 6% in area, a result that holds under different
survey specifications and that matches to within 15% the area obtained from an analytical covariance
calculation. Extending this comparison with our 25 $w$CDM models, we probe the cosmology dependence
of the lensing covariance directly from numerical simulations, reproducing remarkably well the
Fisher results from the analytical models at most cosmologies. We demonstrate that varying the
cosmology at which the covariance matrix is evaluated in the first place might have an order of magnitude
greater impact on the parameter constraints than varying the choice of covariance estimation technique.
We present a test case in which we generate fast predictions for both the lensing signal and its associated
variance with a flexible Gaussian process regression emulator, achieving an accuracy of a few percent
on the former and 10% on the latter.
