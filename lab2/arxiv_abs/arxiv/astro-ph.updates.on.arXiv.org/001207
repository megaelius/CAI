We present a new N-body simulation from the MICE collaboration, the MICE Grand Challenge (MICE-GC),
containing about 70 billion dark-matter particles in a (3 Gpc/h)^3 comoving volume. Given its large
volume and fine spatial resolution, spanning over 5 orders of magnitude in dynamic range, it allows
an accurate modeling of the growth of structure in the universe from the linear through the highly
non-linear regime of gravitational clustering. We validate the dark-matter simulation outputs
using 3D and 2D clustering statistics, and discuss mass-resolution effects in the non-linear regime
by comparing to previous simulations and the latest numerical fits. We show that the MICE-GC run
allows for a measurement of the BAO feature with percent level accuracy and compare it to state-of-the-art
theoretical models. We also use sub-arcmin resolution pixelized 2D maps of the dark-matter counts
in the lightcone to make tomographic analyses in real and redshift space. Our analysis shows the
simulation reproduces the Kaiser effect on large scales, whereas we find a significant suppression
of power on non-linear scales relative to the real space clustering. We complete our validation
by presenting an analysis of the 3-point correlation function in this and previous MICE simulations,
finding further evidence for mass-resolution effects. This is the first of a series of 3 papers in
which we present the MICE-GC end-to-end simulation, along with a wide (5000 sq.deg) and deep (z<1.4)
mock galaxy catalog constructed using a hybrid Halo Occupation Distribution and Halo Abundance
Matching approach. Accompanying these papers, we make a first public release of the MICE-GC lightcone
galaxy mock (MICECAT v1.0) through a dedicated webportal for simulations, this http URL , to help
developing and exploiting the new generation of astronomical surveys.
