We report the discovery and spectroscopic confirmation of 22 new gravitationally lensed quasars
found using $\textit{Gaia}$ data release 2. The selection was made using several techniques: multiple
$\textit{Gaia}$ detections around objects in quasar candidate catalogues, modelling of unWISE
coadd pixels using $\textit{Gaia}$ astrometry, and $\textit{Gaia}$ detections offset from photometric
and spectroscopic galaxies. Spectra of 33 candidates were obtained with the William Herschel Telescope,
22 of which are lensed quasars, 2 highly probably lensed quasars, 5 nearly identical quasar pairs,
1 inconclusive system, and 3 contaminants. Of the 3 confirmed quadruply imaged systems, J2145+6345
is a 2.1 arcsecond separation quad with 4 bright images ($G$=16.86, 17.26, 18.34, 18.56), making
it ideal for time delay monitoring. Analysing this new sample alongside known lenses in the Pan-STARRS
footprint, and comparing to expected numbers of lenses, we show that, as expected, we are biased
towards systems with bright lensing galaxies and low source redshifts. We discuss possible techniques
to remove this bias from future searches. A |b|>20 complete sample of lensed quasars detected by
$\textit{Gaia}$ and with image separations above 1 arcsecond will provide a valuable statistical
sample of around 350 systems. Currently only 96 known lenses satisfy these criteria, yet promisingly,
our unWISE modelling technique is able to recover all of these with simple WISE-$\textit{Gaia}$
colour cuts that remove $\sim$80 per cent of previously followed-up contaminants. Finally, we
provide an online database of known lenses, quasar pairs, and contaminant systems.
