We investigate the patterns observed in ejecta curtain induced by hypervelocity impact (2-6 km/s)
with a variety of the size and shape of target particles. We characterize the patterns by an angle,
defined as the ratio of the characteristic length of the pattern obtained by Fourier transformation
to the distance from the impact point. This angle is found to be almost the same as that obtained by
the reanalysis of the patterns in the previous study at lower impact velocities (Kadono et al., 2015,
Icarus 250, 215-221), which are consistent with lunar crater-ray systems. Assuming that the pattern
is formed by mutual collision of particles with fluctuation velocity in excavation flow, we evaluate
an angle at which the pattern growth stops and show that this angle is the same in the order of magnitude
as the ratio of the fluctuation velocity and the radial velocity. This relation is confirmed in the
results of experiments and numerical simulations. Finally, we discuss the dependence of the patterns
on impact conditions. The experiments show no dependence of the angle on impact velocity. This indicates
that the ratio between the fluctuation and radial velocity components in excavation flow does not
depend on impact velocity. Moreover, the independences on particle size and particle shape suggest
that the angle characterizing the structure of the patterns does not depend on cohesive force. Since
cohesive forces should be related with elastic properties of particles, the structure does not
depend on elastic properties, though inelastic collisions are important for the persistence and
contrast of the patterns.
