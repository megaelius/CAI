We report on a population of short duration near-ultraviolet (NUV) flares in stars observed by the
Kepler and GALEX missions. We analyzed NUV light curves of 34,276 stars observed from 2009-2013
by both the GALEX (NUV) and Kepler (optical) space missions with the eventual goal of investigating
multi-wavelength flares. From the GALEX data we constructed light curves with a 10 second cadence,
and ultimately detected 1,904 short duration flares on 1,021 stars. The vast majority (94.5\%)
of these flares have durations less than five minutes, with flare flux enhancements above the quiescent
flux level ranging from 1.5 to 1700. The flaring stars are primarily solar-like, with T$_{\rm eff}$
ranging from 3,000-11,000 K and radii between 0.5-15 R$_{\odot}$. This set of flaring stars is almost
entirely distinct from that of previous flare surveys of Kepler data and indicates a previously
undetected collection of small flares contained within the Kepler sample. The range in flare energies
spans 1.8$\times$10$^{32}$-8.9$\times$10$^{37}$ erg, with associated relative errors spanning
2-87\%. The flare frequency distribution by energy follows a power-law with index $\alpha=1.72\pm0.05$,
consistent with results of other solar and stellar flare studies at a range of wavelengths. This
supports the idea that the NUV flares we observe are governed by the same physical processes present
in solar and optical flares. The relationship between flare duration and associated flare energy
extends results found for solar and stellar white-light flares, and suggests that these flares
originate in regions with magnetic field strengths of several hundred Gauss, and length scales
of order 10$^{10}$ cm.
