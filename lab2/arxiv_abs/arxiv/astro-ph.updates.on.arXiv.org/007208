Inner Oort Cloud objects have perihelia beyond the Kuiper Belt with semi-major axes less than a few
thousand au. They are beyond the strong gravitational influences of the known planets yet are tightly
bound to the Sun such that outside forces minimally affect them. Here we report the discovery of the
third known Inner Oort Cloud object after Sedna and 2012 VP113, called 2015 TG387. 2015 TG387 has
a perihelion of 65 +-1 au with a semi-major axis of 1190 +-70 au. The longitude of perihelion angle
for 2015 TG387 is between that of Sedna and 2012 VP113, and thus similar to the main group of clustered
extreme trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs), which may be shepherded into similar orbital angles
by an unknown massive distant planet, called Planet X or Planet 9. 2015 TG387's orbit is stable over
the age of the solar system from the known planets and Galactic tide. When including simulated stellar
encounters to our Sun over 4 Gyrs, 2015 TG387's orbit is still mostly stable, but its dynamical evolution
depends on the stellar encounter scenarios used. Surprisingly, when including a massive Planet
X beyond a few hundred au on an eccentric orbit that is anti-aligned in longitude of perihelion with
most of the known ETNOs, we find 2015 TG387 is typically stable for Planet X orbits that render the
other ETNOs stable as well. In fact, 2015 TG387's longitude of perihelion librates about 180 degrees
from Planet X's longitude of perihelion in most stable simulations, keeping 2015 TG387 anti-aligned
with Planet X over the age of the solar system. We find a power law slope near 3 for the semi-major axis
distribution of Inner Oort Cloud objects (IOCs), meaning there are many more high than low semi-major
axis IOCs. There are about 2 million IOCs larger than 40 km, giving a mass of 10^22 kg. The IOCs inclination
distribution is similar to the scattered disk, with an average inclination of 19 degs.
