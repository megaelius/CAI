We describe the sample design for the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey and present the final properties of the
main samples along with important considerations for using these samples for science. Our target
selection criteria were developed while simultaneously optimizing the size distribution of the
MaNGA integral field units (IFUs), the IFU allocation strategy, and the target density to produce
a survey defined in terms of maximizing S/N, spatial resolution, and sample size. Our selection
strategy makes use of redshift limits that only depend on i-band absolute magnitude ($M_i$), or,
for a small subset of our sample, $M_i$ and color (NUV-i). Such a strategy ensures that all galaxies
span the same range in angular size irrespective of luminosity and are therefore covered evenly
by the adopted range of IFU sizes. We define three samples: the Primary and Secondary samples are
selected to have a flat number density with respect to $M_i$ and are targeted to have spectroscopic
coverage to 1.5 and 2.5 effective radii (Re), respectively. The Color-Enhanced supplement increases
the number of galaxies in the low-density regions of color-magnitude space by extending the redshift
limits of the Primary sample in the appropriate color bins. The samples cover the stellar mass range
$5\times10^8 \leq M_* \leq 3\times10^{11} M_{\odot}$ and are sampled at median physical resolutions
of 1.37 kpc and 2.5 kpc for the Primary and Secondary samples respectively. We provide weights that
will statistically correct for our luminosity and color-dependent selection function and IFU
allocation strategy, thus correcting the observed sample to a volume limited sample.
