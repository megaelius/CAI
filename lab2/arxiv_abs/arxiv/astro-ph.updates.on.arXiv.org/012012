Primordial black hole production in the mass range $10-10^4 \,{\rm M_\odot}$ is motivated respectively
by interpretations of the LIGO/Virgo observations of binary black hole mergers and by their ability
to seed intermediate black holes which would account for the presence of supermassive black holes
at very high redshift. Their existence would imply a boost in the primordial power spectrum if they
were produced by overdensities reentering the horizon and collapsing after single-field inflation.
This, together with their associated Poisson fluctuations would cause a boost in the matter power
spectrum on small scales. In fact, any evidence of extra power above that of an almost scale-invariant
primordial power spectrum on small scales would suggest a non-single-field slow-roll model of
inflation, whether or not primordial black holes were produced. The extra power could become potentially
observable in the 21cm power spectrum on scales around $k\sim0.1 - 50\,{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ either with
the new generation of filled low frequency interferometers. We explicitly include the contribution
from primordial fluctuations in our prediction of the 21cm signal which has been previously neglected,
by constructing primordial power spectra motivated by single-field models of inflation that would
produce extra power on small scales. We find that depending on the mass and abundance of primordial
black holes, it is important to include this contribution from the primordial fluctuations, so
as not to underestimate the 21cm signal. Evidently our predictions of detectability, which lack
any modelling of foregrounds, are unrealistic, but we hope that they will motivate improved cleaning
algorithms that can enable us to access this intriguing corner of PBH-motivated parameter space.
