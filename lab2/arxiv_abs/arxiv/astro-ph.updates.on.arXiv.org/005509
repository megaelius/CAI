The star formation (SFH) and chemical enrichment (CEH) histories of Local Group galaxies are traditionally
studied by analyzing their resolved stellar populations in a form of color-magnitude diagrams
obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. Star clusters can be studied in integrated light using
ground-based telescopes to much larger distances. They represent snapshots of chemical evolution
of their host galaxy at different ages. Here we present a simple theoretical framework for the chemical
evolution based on the instantaneous recycling approximation (IRA) model. We infer a CEH from a
SFH and vice versa using observational data. We also present a more advanced model for the evolution
of individual chemical elements which takes into account the contribution of supernovae type Ia.
We demonstrate that ages, iron and $\alpha$-element abundances of 15 star clusters derived from
fitting of their integrated optical spectra reliably trace the CEH of the Large Magellanic Cloud
obtained from resolved stellar populations in the age range 40Myr$<t<$3.5Gyr. The CEH predicted
by our model from the global SFH of the LMC agrees remarkably well with the observed cluster age-metallicity
relation. Moreover, the present day total gas mass of the LMC estimated by the IRA model ($6.2\cdot10^8
M_{\odot}$) matches within uncertainties the observed HI mass corrected for the presence of molecular
gas ($5.8\pm0.5\cdot10^8 M_{\odot}$). We briefly discuss how our approach can be used to study
SFHs of galaxies as distant as 10Mpc at the level of detail that is currently available only in a handful
of nearby Milky Way satellites.
