Subjective classification of galaxies can mislead us in the quest of the origin regarding formation
and evolution of galaxies since this is necessarily limited to a few features. The human mind is not
able to apprehend the complex correlations in a manyfold parameter space, and multivariate analyses
are the best tools to understand the differences among various kinds of objects. In this series of
papers, an objective classification of 362,923 galaxies from the Value Added Galaxy Catalogue
(VAGC) is carried out with the help of two methods of multivariate analysis. First, Independent
Component Analysis (ICA) is used to determine a set of derived independent components that are linear
combinations of 47 observed features (viz. ionized lines, Lick indices, photometric and morphological
properties, star formation rates etc.) of the galaxies. Subsequently, a K-means cluster analysis
is applied on the nine independent components to obtain ten distinct and homogeneous groups. In
this first paper, we describe the methods and the main results. It appears that the nine Independent
Components represent a complete physical description of galaxies (velocity dispersion, ionisation,
metallicity, surface brightness and structure). We find that our ten groups can be essentially
placed into traditional and empirical classes (from colour-magnitude and emission-line diagnostic
diagrams, early- vs late-types) despite the classical corresponding features (colour, line ratios
and morphology) being not significantly correlated with the nine Independent Components. More
detailed physical interpretation of the groups will be performed in subsequent papers.
