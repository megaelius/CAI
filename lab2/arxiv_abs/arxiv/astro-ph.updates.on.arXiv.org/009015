The Chandra X-ray Observatory has detected relatively hard X-ray emission from the central stars
of several planetary nebulae (PNe). A subset have no known late-type companions, making it very
difficult to isolate which of several competing mechanisms may be producing the X-ray emission.
The central star of NGC 2392 is one of the most vexing members, with substantial indirect evidence
for a hot white dwarf (WD) companion. Here we report on the results of a radial velocity (RV) monitoring
campaign of its central star with the HERMES echelle spectrograph of the Flemish 1.2 m Mercator telescope.
We discover a single-lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of $1.902208\pm0.000013$
d and a RV semi-amplitude of $9.96\pm0.13$ km/s. The high degree of nebula ionisation requires a
WD companion ($M\gtrsim0.6 M_\odot$), which the mass-function supports at orbital inclinations
$\lesssim$7 deg, in agreement with the nebula orientation of 9 deg. The hard component of the X-ray
spectrum may be explained by the companion accreting mass from the wind of the Roche lobe filling
primary, while the softer component may be due to colliding winds. A companion with a stronger wind
than the primary could produce the latter and would be consistent with models of the observed diffuse
X-ray emission detected in the nebula. The diffuse X-rays may also be powered by the jets of up to 180
km/s and active accretion would imply that they could be the first active jets of a post-common-envelope
PN, potentially making NGC 2392 an invaluable laboratory to study jet formation physics. The 1.9
d orbital period rules out a double-degenerate merger leading to a Type Ia supernova and the weak
wind of the primary likely also precludes a single-degenerate scenario. We suggest that a hard X-ray
spectrum, in the absence of a late-type companion, could be a powerful tool to identify accreting
WD companions.
