Extending (\citealt{alvio1}), we analyze the physics of the turbulent cascade in stars. Our simulations
give an asymptotic limit for the global damping length for turbulent kinetic energy, $\ld \sim \langle
u^3 \rangle /\langle \epsilon \rangle$, in strongly stratified stellar convection. We identify
it with the "mixing length parameter", $\alpha = \ell_{\rm MLT}/H_P =\Gamma_1 \sim5/3$. This theoretical
prediction agrees to within $\sim$10\% with estimates from stellar evolution, and $\sim$20\%
over the range for stellar atmospheres with variable $\alpha$. For weak stratification $\ld$ shrinks
to the depth of such a thin convective region. Zoning has little effect on the global dissipation
in the turbulent cascade. In the astrophysically appropriate inviscid limit no explicit viscosity
is required. Dissipation by mild shocks from "blow up" of the Euler equations (\citealt{frisch})
drives turbulent kinetic energy from the largest to the smallest scales. In the incompressible
limit nonlinear fluid effects involving vorticity \citep{gitaylor,onsager} control dissipation.
Our implicit large eddy simulations (ILES) resolve the energy-containing eddies, develop a turbulent
cascade down to the grid scale, and produce surfaces of separation at boundary layers. The turbulent
cascade converges quickly as \cite{onsager} suggested, and satisfies a power-law velocity spectrum
similar to \cite{kolmg41}. We derive a dissipation rate from Reynolds stresses which agrees with
our ILES, experiments \citep{warhaft}, and high Reynolds number, direct numerical simulations
(DNS) of the Navier-Stokes equations (\citealt{iyer4096,sree}) which they resemble. They develop
turbulent "anomalies" due to intermittency, anisotropy, and interactions between coherent structures,
features which are missing from K41 theory (\citealt{kolmg41}).
