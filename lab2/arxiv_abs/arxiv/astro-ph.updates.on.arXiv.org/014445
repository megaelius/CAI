Magnetic fields play an important role in the dynamics of present-day molecular clouds. Recent
work has shown that magnetic fields are equally important for primordial clouds, which form the
first stars in the Universe. While the primordial magnetic field strength on cosmic scales is largely
unconstrained, theoretical models strongly suggest that a weak seed field existed in the early
Universe. We study how the amplification of such a weak field can influence the evolution of accretion
discs around the first stars, and thus affect the primordial initial mass function (IMF). We perform
a suite of 3D magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with different initial field strengths and
numerical resolutions. We find that, in simulations with sufficient spatial resolution to resolve
the Jeans scale during the collapse, even initially weak magnetic fields grow exponentially to
become dynamically important due to both the so-called \textit{small-scale turbulent dynamo}
and the \textit{large-scale mean-field dynamo}. Capturing the small-scale dynamo action depends
primarily on how well we resolve the Jeans length, while capturing the large-scale dynamo depends
on the Jeans resolution as well as the maximum absolute resolution. Provided enough resolution,
we find that fragmentation does not depend strongly on the initial field strength, because even
weak fields grow to become strong. However, fragmentation in runs with magnetic fields differs
significantly from those without magnetic fields. We conclude that the development of dynamically
strong magnetic fields during the formation of the first stars is likely inevitable, and that these
fields had a significant impact on the primordial IMF.
