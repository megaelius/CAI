We describe an extension of the Enzo code to enable fully-coupled radiation hydrodynamical simulation
of inhomogeneous reionization in large $\sim (100 Mpc)^3$ cosmological volumes with thousands
to millions of point sources. We solve all dynamical, radiative transfer, thermal, and ionization
processes self-consistently on the same mesh, as opposed to a postprocessing approach which coarse-grains
the radiative transfer. We do, however, employ a simple subgrid model for star formation which we
calibrate to observations. Radiation transport is done in the grey flux-limited diffusion (FLD)
approximation, which is solved by implicit time integration split off from the gas energy and ionization
equations, which are solved separately. This results in a faster and more robust scheme for cosmological
applications compared to the earlier method. The FLD equation is solved using the hypre optimally
scalable geometric multigrid solver from LLNL. By treating the ionizing radiation as a grid field
as opposed to rays, our method is scalable with respect to the number of ionizing sources, limited
only by the parallel scaling properties of the radiation solver. We test the speed and accuracy of
our approach on a number of standard verification and validation tests. We show by direct comparison
with Enzo's adaptive ray tracing method Moray that the well-known inability of FLD to cast a shadow
behind opaque clouds has a minor effect on the evolution of ionized volume and mass fractions in a
reionization simulation validation test. We illustrate an application of our method to the problem
of inhomogeneous reionization in a 80 Mpc comoving box resolved with $3200^3$ Eulerian grid cells
and dark matter particles.
