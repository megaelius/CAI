A new model validation and performance assessment tool is introduced, the sliding threshold of
observation for numeric evaluation (STONE) curve. It is based on the relative operating characteristic
(ROC) curve technique, but instead of sorting all observations in a categorical classification,
the STONE tool uses the continuous nature of the observations. Rather than defining events in the
observations and then sliding the threshold only in the classifier (model) data set, the threshold
is changed simultaneously for both the observational and model values, with the same threshold
value for both data and model. This is only possible if the observations are continuous and the model
output is in the same units and scale as the observations, that is, the model is trying to exactly reproduce
the data. The STONE curve has several similarities with the ROC curve, plotting probability of detection
against probability of false detection, ranging from the (1,1) corner for low thresholds to the
(0,0) corner for high thresholds, and values above the zero-intercept unity-slope line indicating
better than random predictive ability. The main difference is that the STONE curve can be nonmonotonic,
doubling back in both the x and y directions. These ripples reveal asymmetries in the data-model
value pairs. This new technique is applied to modeling output of a common geomagnetic activity index
as well as energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's inner magnetosphere. It is not limited to space
physics applications but can be used for any scientific or engineering field where numerical models
are used to reproduce observations.
