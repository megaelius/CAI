We investigate the Keplerian (mass-shedding) sequence of rotating neutron stars. Twelve different
equations of state are used to describe the nuclear structure. We find four fitting relations which
connect the rotating frequency, mass and radius of stars in the mass-shedding limit to the mass and
radius of stars in the static sequence. We show the breakdown of approximate relation for the Keplerian
frequency derived by Lattimer and Prakash [Science, 304, 536, (2004)] and then we present a new,
EOS-independent and more accurate relation. This relation fits the Keplerian frequency of rotating
neutron stars to about $2\%$ for a large range of the compactness $M_{S}/R_{S}$ of the reference
non-rotating neutron star, namely the static star with the same central density as the rotating
one. The performance of the fitting formula is close to $4\%$ for $M_{S}/R_{S}\leq 0.05~M_{\odot}$/km
($f_{K}\leq 350$~Hz). We present additional EOS-independent relations for the Keplerian sequence
including relations for $M_{K}f_{K}$ and $R_{K}f_{K}$ in terms of $M_{S}f_{S}$ and $R_{S}f_{S}$,
respectively, one of $M_K/R_K$ as a function of $f_{K}/f_{S}$ and $M_S/R_S$, and a relation between
the $M_K$, $R_K$ and $f_K$. These new fitting relations are approximately EOS-independent with
an error in the worst case of $8\%$. The universality of the Keplerian sequence properties presented
here add to the set of other neutron star universal relations in the literature such as the $I$-Love-$Q$
relation, the gravitational binding energy and the energy, angular momentum and radius of the last
circular orbit of a test-particle around rotating neutron stars. This set of universal, analytic
formulas, facilitate the inclusion of general relativistic effects in the description of relativistic
astrophysical systems involving fast rotating neutron stars.
