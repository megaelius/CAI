The influence of considering a generalized dark matter (GDM) model, which allows for a non-pressure-less
dark matter and a non-vanishing sound speed in the non-linear spherical collapse model is discussed
for the Einstein-de Sitter-like (EdSGDM) and $\Lambda$GDM models. By assuming that the vacuum
component responsible for the accelerated expansion of the Universe is not clustering and therefore
behaving similarly to the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, we show how the change in the GDM characteristic
parameters affects the linear density threshold for collapse of the non-relativistic component
($\delta_{\rm c}$) and its virial overdensity ($\Delta_{\rm V}$). We found that the generalized
dark matter equation of state parameter $w_{\rm gdm}$ is responsible for lower values of the linear
overdensity parameter as compared to the standard spherical collapse model and that this effect
is much stronger than the one induced by a change in the generalized dark matter sound speed $c^2_{\rm
s, gdm}$. We also found that the virial overdensity is only slightly affected and mostly sensitive
to the generalized dark matter equation of state parameter $w_{\rm gdm}$. These effects could be
relatively enhanced for lower values of the matter density. Finally, we found that the effects of
the additional physics on $\delta_{\rm c}$ and $\Delta_{\rm V}$, when translated to non-linear
observables such as the halo mass function, induce an overall deviation of about 40\% with respect
to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model at late times for high mass objects. However, within the current
linear constraints for $c^2_{\rm s, gdm}$ and $w_{\rm gdm}$, we found that these changes are the
consequence of properly taking into account the correct linear matter power spectrum for the GDM
model while the effects coming from modifications in the spherical collapse model remain negligible.
