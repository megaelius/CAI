The manner in which the stellar initial mass function (IMF) scales with global galaxy properties
is under debate. We use two hydrodynamical, cosmological simulations to predict possible trends
for two self-consistent variable IMF prescriptions that respectively become locally bottom-heavy
or top-heavy in high-pressure environments. Both simulations have been calibrated to reproduce
the observed correlation between central stellar velocity dispersion and the excess mass-to-light
ratio (MLE) relative to a Salpeter IMF by increasing the mass fraction of, respectively, dwarf stars
or stellar remnants. We find trends of MLE with galaxy age, metallicity and [Mg/Fe] that agree qualitatively
with observations. Predictions for correlations with luminosity, half-light radius, and black
hole mass are presented. The significance of many of these correlations depends sensitively on
galaxy selection criteria such as age, luminosity, and morphology. For an IMF with a varying high-mass
end, some of these correlations are stronger than the correlation with the birth ISM pressure (the
property that governs the form of the IMF), because in this case the MLE has a strong age dependence.
Galaxies with large MLE tend to have overmassive central black holes. This indicates that the abnormally
high MLE observed in the centres of some high-mass galaxies does not imply that overmassive BHs are
merely the result of incorrect IMF assumptions, nor that excess M/L ratios are solely the result
of overmassive BHs. Satellite galaxies tend to scatter toward high MLE due to tidal stripping, which
may have significant implications for the inferred stellar masses of ultracompact dwarf galaxies.
