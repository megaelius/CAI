Telescope scheduling is the task of determining the best sequence of observations (pointings and
filter choices) for a survey system. Because it is computationally intractable to optimize over
all possible multi-year sequences of observations, schedulers use heuristics to pick the best
observation at a given time. A greedy scheduler selects the next observation by choosing whichever
one maximizes a scalar merit function, which serves as a proxy for the scientific goals of the telescope.
This sort of bottom-up approach for scheduling is not guaranteed to produce a schedule for which
the sum of merit over all observations is maximized. As an alternative to greedy schedulers, we introduce
ALTSched, which takes a top-down approach to scheduling. Instead of considering only the next observation,
ALTSched makes global decisions about which area of sky and which filter to observe in, and then refines
these decisions into a sequence of observations taken along the meridian to maximize SNR. We implement
ALTSched for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), and show that it equals or outperforms
the baseline greedy scheduler in essentially all quantitative performance metrics. Due to its
simplicity, our implementation is considerably faster than OpSim, the simulated greedy scheduler
currently used by the LSST Project: a full ten year survey can be simulated in 4 minutes, as opposed
to tens of hours for OpSim. LSST's hardware is fixed, so improving the scheduling algorithm is one
of the only remaining ways to optimize LSST's performance. We see ALTSched as a prototype scheduler
that gives a lower bound on the performance achievable by LSST.
