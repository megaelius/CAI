Asteroseismology can provide joint constraints on masses and radii of individual stars. While
this approach has been extensively tested for red giant branch (RGB) stars, it has been more difficult
to test for helium core-burning red-clump (RC) giants because of the lack of fundamental calibrators.
To provide independent mass estimates, we utilize a number of widely used horizontal-branch (HB)
models in the literature, and derive photometric masses from a comparison with $griBVI_CJHK_s$
photometry. Our selected models disagree with each other on the predicted mass-luminosity-temperature
relation. We adopt first-order corrections on colors and magnitudes to minimize the dispersion
between different models by forcing models to match the observed location in the solar-metallicity
cluster M67. Even for these calibrated models, however, the internal consistency between models
deteriorates at higher metallicities, and photometric mass estimates generally become smaller
than asteroseismic masses, as seen from metal-rich field RC stars with Gaia trigonometric parallaxes.
As a concrete example, the average photometric mass for RC giants in the old, metal-rich cluster,
NGC 6791, ranges from $0.7\ M_\odot$ to $1.1\ M_\odot$, depending on the specific set of models employed.
An ensemble average of the photometric masses ($0.88\pm0.16\ M_\odot$) in NGC 6791 is only marginally
consistent with the asteroseismic mass ($1.16\pm0.04\ M_\odot$). There is a clear tension between
the masses that one would predict from photometry for metal-rich field RC stars, asteroseismic
masses, and those that would be expected from the ages of stars in the Galactic disk populations and
canonical RGB mass loss. We conclude that standard RC models need to be re-examined in light of these
powerful new data sets.
