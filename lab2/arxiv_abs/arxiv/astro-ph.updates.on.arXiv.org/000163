A small number of naturally occurring, proton-rich nuclides (the p-nuclei) cannot be made in the
s- and r-process. Their origin is not well understood. Massive stars can produce p-nuclei through
photodisintegration of pre-existing intermediate and heavy nuclei. This so-called gamma-process
requires high stellar plasma temperatures and occurs mainly in explosive O/Ne burning during a
core-collapse supernova. Although the gamma-process in massive stars has been successful in producing
a large range of p-nuclei, significant deficiences remain. An increasing number of processes and
sites has been studied in recent years in search of viable alternatives replacing or supplementing
the massive star models. A large number of unstable nuclei, however, with only theoretically predicted
reaction rates are included in the reaction network and thus the nuclear input may also bear considerable
uncertainties. The current status of astrophysical models, nuclear input, and observational
constraints is reviewed. After an overview of currently discussed models, the focus is on the possibility
to better constrain those models through different means. Meteoritic data not only provide the
actual isotopic abundances of the p-nuclei but can also put constraints on the possible contribution
of proton-rich nucleosynthesis. The main part of the review focusses on the nuclear uncertainties
involved in the determination of the astrophysical reaction rates required for the extended reaction
networks used in nucleosynthesis studies. Experimental approaches are discussed together with
their necessary connection to theory, which is especially pronounced for reactions with intermediate
and heavy nuclei in explosive nuclear burning, even close to stability.
