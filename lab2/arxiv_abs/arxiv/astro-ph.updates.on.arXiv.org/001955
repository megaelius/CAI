The observation of propagating magneto-hydrodynamic kink waves in magnetic structures and measurement
of their properties (amplitude, phase speed) can be used to diagnose the plasma conditions in the
neighbourhood of the magnetic structure via magneto-seismology (MS). We aim to reveal properties
of the chromosphere/Transition Region above the sunspot penumbra using this technique. Hinode
observed a sunspot as it was crossing the limb, providing a unique side on view of the sunspot atmosphere.
The presence of large spicule-like jets is evident in \ion{Ca}{II} H images. The jets are found to
support transverse wave motions that displace the central axis, which can be interpreted as a kink
wave. The properties of a wave event are measured and used to determine the magnetic and density stratification
along the structure. We also measure the width of the spicule and the intensity profile along the
structure. The measured wave properties reveal an initial rapid increase in amplitude with height
above the solar surface, followed by a decrease in amplitude. The MS inversion suggests this initial
increase corresponds to large changes in density and magnetic field strength. In addition, we provide
the first measurements of spicule width with height, which confirm that the spicule under goes rapid
expansion. The measured expansion shows good agreement with the results from the MS. The observed
variations in plasma parameters are suggested to be partly due to the presence of a gravitational
stratified, ambient atmosphere. Combining width measurements with phase speed measurements
implies the observed decrease in wave amplitude at greater heights can be explained by wave damping.
Hence, we provide the first direct evidence of wave damping in chromospheric spicules and the quality
factor of the damping is found to be significantly smaller than estimated coronal values.
