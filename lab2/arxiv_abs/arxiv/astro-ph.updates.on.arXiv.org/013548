We present \nustar{} observation of the atoll type neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB)
Serpens~X-1 (Ser~X-1) performed on 17 February 2018. We observed Ser~X-1 in a soft X-ray spectral
state with 3-79 keV luminosity of $L_\text{X}\sim0.4\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\sim 23\%$
of the Eddington luminosity), assuming a distance of 7.7 kpc. A positive correlation between intensity
and hardness ratio suggests that the source was in the banana branch during this observation. The
broadband 3-30 keV NuSTAR energy spectrum can be well described either by a three-component continuum
model consisting of a disk blackbody, a single temperature blackbody and a power-law or by a two-component
continuum model consisting of a disk blackbody and a Comptonization component. A broad iron line
$\sim 5-8$ keV and the Compton back-scattering hump peaking at $\sim$10-20 keV band are clearly
detected in the X-ray spectrum. These features are best interpreted by a self-consistent relativistic
reflection model. Fits with relativistically blurred disc reflection model suggests that the
inner disc radius $R_{in}$ is truncated prior to the ISCO at $(1.9-2.5)\;R_{ISCO}$ ($\simeq11.4-15\,R_{g}\:
\text{or}\: 26-34$ km) and the accretion disc is viewed at an low inclination of $i\simeq16^\circ-20^\circ$.
The disc is likely to be truncated either by a boundary layer or by the magnetosphere. Based on the
measured flux and the mass accretion rate, the maximum radial extension for the boundary layer is
estimated to be $\sim6.4\:R_{g}$ from the NS surface. The truncated inner disc in association with
pressure from a magnetic field sets an upper limit of $B\leq1.9\times10^{9}$ G.
