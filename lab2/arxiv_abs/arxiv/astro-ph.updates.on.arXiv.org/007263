A large fraction of massive stars evolve in interacting binary systems, which dramatically modifies
the outcome of stellar evolution. We investigated the properties of blue supergiants in binary
systems and whether they are suitable for extragalactic distance determinations using the flux-weighted
gravity luminosity relationship (FGLR). This is a relationship between the absolute bolometric
magnitude $M_{\rm bol}$ and the spectroscopically determined flux-weighted gravity $g_{\rm
F} = g/T^4_{\rm eff}$. We computed a grid of binary stellar evolution models with MESA and use the
v2.1 BPASS models to examine whether they are compatible with the relatively small scatter shown
by the observed relationship. Our models have initial primary masses of 9 - 30 $M_\odot$, initial
orbital periods of 10 - 2511 days, mass ratio $q$ = 0.9, and metallicity $Z$ = 0.02. We find that the
majority of primary stars that produce blue supergiant stages are consistent with the observed
FGLR, with a small offset towards brighter bolometric magnitudes. In between 1\% - 24\% of cases,
binary evolution may produce blue supergiants after a mass transfer episode, that lie below the
observed FGLR. A small number of such stars have been found in extragalactic FGLR studies, suggesting
that they may have evolved through binary interaction. Some models with shorter periods could resemble
blue hypergiants and LBVs. We used CMFGEN radiative transfer models to investigate the effects
of unresolved secondaries on diagnostics for $T_{\rm eff}$ and $g$, and the biases on the determination
of interstellar reddening and $M_{\rm bol}$. We find that the effects are small and within the observed
scatter, but could lead to a small overestimate of the luminosity, of $T_{\rm eff}$ and of $g$ for
extreme cases. We conclude that the observed FGLR can, in principle, be well reproduced by close
binary evolution models.
