A self-consistent two-dimensional model is proposed to account for the transient mesospheric
nighttime optical emissions associated to possible intra-cloud (IC) lightning occurring in the
Venusian troposphere. The model calculates the mesospheric (between 75 km and 120 km in altitude)
quasielestrostatic electric field and electron density produced in response to IC lightning activity
located beween 40 km and 65 km in the Venusian cloud layer. The optical signatures and the densities
of perturbed excited atomic and molecular neutral and ionic species in the mesosphere of Venus are
also calcutated using a basic kinetic scheme. The calculations were performed for different IC
lightning discharge properties [Krasnopolsky (1980), Cosmic. Res.]. We found that the calculated
electric fields in the mesosphere of Venus are above breakdown values and that, consequently, visible
transient glows (similar to terrestrial Halos produced by lightning) right above the parent IC
lightning are predicted. The transient optical emissions result from radiative de-excitation
of excited electronic states of N$_2$ (in the ultraviolet, visible and near infrared ranges) and
of O($^{1}$S) and of O($^{1}$D) in, respectively, the green (557 nm) and red (630 nm) wavelengths.
The predicted transient lightning induced glows from O($^{1}$S) can reach an intensity higher
than 167 R and, consequently, be above the detection threshold of the Lightning and Airglow Camera
(LAC) instrument aboard the japanese Akatsuki probe orbiting Venus since Dec 2015. However, according
to our model, successful observations of transient lightning-induced optical glows could only
be possible for sufficiently close (300 km or maximum 1000 km) distances.
