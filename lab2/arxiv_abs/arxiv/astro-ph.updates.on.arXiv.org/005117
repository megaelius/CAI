Some low-mass stars appear to have larger radii than predicted by standard 1D structure models;
prior work has suggested that inefficient convective heat transport, due to rotation and/or magnetism,
may ultimately be responsible. We examine this issue using 1D stellar models constructed using
Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). First, we consider standard models that
do not explicitly include rotational/magnetic effects, with convective inhibition modeled by
decreasing a depth-independent mixing length theory (MLT) parameter $\alpha_{\text{MLT}}$
(following Cox et al. 1981; Chabrier et al. 2007). We provide formulae linking changes in $\alpha_{\text{MLT}}$
to changes in the interior specific entropy, and hence to the stellar radius. Next, we modify the
MLT formulation in MESA to mimic explicitly the influence of rotation and magnetism, using formulations
suggested by Stevenson (1979) and MacDonald & Mullan (2014) respectively. We find rapid rotation
in these models has a negligible impact on stellar structure, primarily because a star's adiabat,
and hence its radius, is predominantly affected by layers near the surface; convection is rapid
and largely uninfluenced by rotation there. Magnetic fields, if they influenced convective transport
in the manner described by MacDonald & Mullan (2014), could lead to more noticeable radius inflation.
Finally, we show that these non-standard effects on stellar structure can be fabricated using a
depth-dependent $\alpha_{\text{MLT}}$: a non-magnetic, non-rotating model can be produced
that is virtually indistinguishable from one that explicitly parameterizes rotation and/or magnetism
using the two formulations above. We provide formulae linking the radially-variable $\alpha_{\text{MLT}}$
to these putative MLT reformulations.
