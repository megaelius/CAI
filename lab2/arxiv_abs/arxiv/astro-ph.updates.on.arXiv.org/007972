The LSST survey was designed to deliver transformative results for four primary objectives: constraining
dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical
sky, and mapping the Milky Way. While the LSST Wide-Fast-Deep survey and accompanying Deep Drilling
and mini-surveys will be ground-breaking for each of these areas, there remain competing demands
on the survey area, depth, and temporal coverage amid a desire to maximize all three. In this white
paper, we seek to address a principal source of tension between the different LSST science collaborations,
that of the survey area and depth that they each need in the parts of the sky that they care about. We
present simple tools which can be used to explore trades between the area surveyed by LSST and the
number of visits available per field and then use these tools to propose a change to the baseline survey
strategy. Specifically, we propose to reconfigure the WFD footprint to consist of low-extinction
regions (limited by galactic latitude), with the number of visits per field in WFD limited by the
LSST Science Requirements Document (SRD) design goal, and suggest assignment of the remaining
LSST visits to the full visible LSST sky. This proposal addresses concerns with the WFD footprint
raised by the DESC (as 25 percent of the current baseline WFD region is not usable for dark energy science
due to MW dust extinction), eases the time required for the NES and SCP mini-surveys (since in our
proposal they would partially fall into the modified WFD footprint), raises the number of visits
previously assigned to the GP region, and increases the overlap with DESI and other Northern hemisphere
follow-up facilities. This proposal alleviates many of the current concerns of Science Collaborations
that represent the four scientific pillars of LSST and provides a Big Sky approach to cadence diplomacy.
