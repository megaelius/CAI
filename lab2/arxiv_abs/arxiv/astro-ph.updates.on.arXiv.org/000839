The growth of luminous structures and the building blocks of life in the Universe began as primordial
gas was processed in stars and mixed at galactic scales. The mechanisms responsible for this development
are not well understood and have changed over the intervening 13 billion years. To follow the evolution
of matter over cosmic time, it is necessary to study the strongest (resonance) transitions of the
most abundant species in the Universe. Most of them are in the ultraviolet (UV; 950A-3000A) spectral
range that is unobservable from the ground. A versatile space observatory with UV sensitivity a
factor of 50-100 greater than existing facilities will revolutionize our understanding of the
Universe. Habitable planets grow in protostellar discs under ultraviolet irradiation, a by-product
of the star-disk interaction that drives the physical and chemical evolution of discs and young
planetary systems. The electronic transitions of the most abundant molecules are pumped by the
UV field, providing unique diagnostics of the planet-forming environment that cannot be accessed
from the ground. Earth's atmosphere is in constant interaction with the interplanetary medium
and the solar UV radiation field. A 50-100 times improvement in sensitivity would enable the observation
of the key atmospheric ingredients of Earth-like exoplanets (carbon, oxygen, ozone), provide
crucial input for models of biologically active worlds outside the solar system, and provide the
phenomenological baseline to understand the Earth atmosphere in context. In this white paper,
we outline the key science that such a facility would make possible and outline the instrumentation
to be implemented.
