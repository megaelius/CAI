We use the fundamental parameters delivered by the GES consortium in the first internal data release
to select the members of $\gamma$ Vel and Cha I among the UVES and GIRAFFE spectroscopic observations.
A total of 140 $\gamma$ Vel members and 74 Cha I members were studied. We calculated stellar luminosities
through spectral energy distributions, while stellar masses were derived by comparison with evolutionary
tracks. The spectral subtraction of low-activity and slowly rotating templates, which are rotationally
broadened to match the $v\sin i$ of the targets, enabled us to measure the equivalent widths (EWs)
and the fluxes in the H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines. The H$\alpha$ line was also used for identifying
accreting objects and for evaluating the mass accretion rate ($\dot M_{\rm acc}$). The distribution
of $v\sin i$ for the members of $\gamma$ Vel displays a peak at about 10 km s$^{-1}$ with a tail toward
faster rotators. There is also some indication of a different $v\sin i$ distribution for the members
of its two kinematical populations. Only a handful of stars in $\gamma$ Vel display signatures of
accretion, while many more accretors were detected in the younger Cha~I. Accreting and active stars
occupy two different regions in a $T_{\rm eff}$-flux diagram and we propose a criterion for distinguishing
them. We derive $\dot M_{\rm acc}$ in the ranges $10^{-11}$-$10^{-9} M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ and $10^{-10}$-$10^{-7}
M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ for $\gamma$ Vel and Cha I accretors, respectively. We find less scatter in the
$\dot M_{\rm acc}-M_\star$ relation derived through the H$\alpha$ EWs, when compared to the H$\alpha$
$10\%W$ diagnostics, in agreement with other authors.
