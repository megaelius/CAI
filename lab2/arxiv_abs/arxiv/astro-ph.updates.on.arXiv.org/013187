Context. The wind driven halo is a feature observed within the images delivered by the latest generation
of ground-based instruments equipped with an extreme adaptive optics system and a coronagraphic
device, such as SPHERE at the VLT. This signature appears when the atmospheric turbulence conditions
are varying faster than the adaptive optics loop can correct. The wind driven halo shows as a radial
extension of the point spread function along a distinct direction (sometimes referred to as the
butterfly pattern). When present, it significantly limits the contrast capabilities of the instrument
and prevents the extraction of signals at close separation or extended signals such as circumstellar
disks. This limitation is consequential because it contaminates the data a substantial fraction
of the time: about 30% of the data produced by the VLT/SPHERE instrument are affected by the wind driven
halo.Aims. This paper reviews the causes of the wind driven halo and presents a method to analyze
its contribution directly from the scientific images. Its effect on the raw contrast and on the final
contrast after post-processing is demonstrated.Methods. We used simulations and on-sky SPHERE
data to verify that the parameters extracted with our method are capable of describing the wind driven
halo present in the images. We studied the temporal, spatial and spectral variation of these parameters
to point out its deleterious effect on the final contrast.Results. The data driven analysis we propose
does provide information to accurately describe the wind driven halo contribution in the images.
This analysis justifies why this is a fundamental limitation to the final contrast performance
reached.Conclusions. With the established procedure, we will analyze a large sample of data delivered
by SPHERE in order to propose, in the future, post-processing techniques tailored to remove the
wind driven halo.
