Distant luminous Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) are excellent targets for spectroscopic observations
of galaxies in the epoch of reionisation (EoR). We present deep high-resolution (R=5000) VLT/X-SHOOTER
observations, along with an extensive collection of photometric data of `COLA1', a proposed double
peaked LAE at z=6.6 (Hu et al. 2016). We rule out that COLA1's emission line is an [OII] doublet at z=1.475
on the basis of i) the asymmetric red line-profile and flux ratio of the peaks (blue/red=$0.31\pm0.03$)
and ii) an unphysical [OII]/Ha ratio ([OII]/Ha > 22). We show that COLA1's observed B-band flux is
explained by a faint extended foreground LAE, for which we detect Lya and [OIII] at z=2.142. We thus
conclude that COLA1 is a real double-peaked LAE at z=6.593, the first discovered at z>6. COLA1 is
UV luminous (M$_{1500}=-21.6\pm0.3$), has a high equivalent width (EW$_{0, Ly\alpha}$~85 \AA)
and very compact Lya emission (r$_{50, Ly\alpha} = 0.3$ kpc). Relatively weak inferred Hb+[OIII]
line-emission from Spitzer/IRAC indicates an extremely low metallicity of Z<1/20 Z$_{\odot}$
or reduced strength of nebular lines due to high escape of ionising photons. The small Lya peak separation
of $220\pm20$ km/s implies a low HI column density and an ionising photon escape fraction of ~15-30
%, providing the first direct evidence that such galaxies contribute actively to the reionisation
of the Universe at z>6. Based on simple estimates, we find that COLA1 could have provided just enough
photons to reionise its own ~0.3 pMpc (2.3 cMpc) bubble, allowing the blue Lya line to be observed.
However, we also discuss alternative scenarios explaining the detected double peaked nature of
COLA1. Our results show that future high-resolution observations of statistical samples of double
peaked LAEs at z>5 are a promising probe of the occurrence of ionised regions around galaxies in the
EoR.
