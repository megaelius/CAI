Context: Planet formation by pebble accretion is an alternative to planetesimal-driven core accretion.
In this scenario, planets grow by accreting cm-to-m-sized pebbles instead of km-sized planetesimals.
One of the main differences with planetesimal-driven core accretion is the increased thermal ablation
experienced by pebbles. This can provide early enrichment to the planet's envelope, which changes
the process of core growth. Aims: We aim to predict core masses and envelope compositions of planets
that form by pebble accretion and compare mass deposition of pebbles to planetesimals. Methods:
We model the early growth of a proto-planet by calculating the structure of its envelope, taking
into account the fate of impacting pebbles or planetesimals. The region where high-Z material can
exist in vapor form is determined by the vapor pressure. We include enrichment effects by locally
modifying the mean molecular weight of the envelope. Results: In the pebble case, three phases of
core growth can be identified. In the first phase, pebbles impact the core without significant ablation.
During the second phase, ablation becomes increasingly severe. A layer of high-Z vapor starts to
form around the core that absorbs a small fraction of the ablated mass. The rest either rains out to
the core or mixes outwards instead, slowing core growth. In the third phase, the high-Z inner region
expands outwards, absorbing an increasing fraction of the ablated material as vapor. Rainout ends
before the core mass reaches 0.6 M_Earth, terminating direct core growth. In the case of icy H2O pebbles,
this happens before 0.1 M_Earth. Conclusions: Our results indicate that pebble accretion can directly
form rocky cores up to only 0.6 M_Earth, and is unable to form similarly sized icy cores. Subsequent
core growth can proceed indirectly when the planet cools, provided it is able to retain its high-Z
material.
