Understanding ionizing fluxes of stellar populations is crucial for various astrophysical problems
including the epoch of reionization. Massive short-lived Wolf-Rayet stars are generally considered
as the main ionizing sources. We examine the role of less massive stars that lose their envelope through
interaction with a companion. We use the evolutionary code MESA and the radiative transfer code
CMFGEN to investigate stripped stars as a function of metallicity (Z). We show that typical progenitors,
initially 12$M_{\odot}$, produce hot and compact stars (~4$M_{\odot}$, 60-80 kK, ~1$R_{\odot}$)
that copiously produce ionizing photons, emitting 60-85% and 30-60% of their energy as HI and HeI
ionizing radiation, for Z=0.0001-0.02. This is comparable to a typical massive Wolf-Rayet star,
when accounting for their longer lifetimes and the favoring initial mass function. Stripped stars
further emit their ionizing photons with a delay (~20Myrs after star formation for this progenitor),
allowing time for stellar feedback to disperse the birth clouds. This increases the fraction that
can escape and contribute to ionization of the intergalactic medium. We further find that Roche
stripping fails to fully remove the H-rich envelope at low Z. This questions the common treatment
of stripped stars in rapid population synthesis simulations as pure helium stars. We expect implications
for the rate of type Ib/c supernova at low Z and for the advanced evolutionary channels for type Ia
supernova and gravitational wave sources. We discuss how the characteristic spectral features
of stripped stars can be used to increase the observed sample, which is urgently needed to test the
models.
