Discovery of the first interstellar asteroid (ISA) - 1I/2017 'Oumuamua - raised a number of questions
regarding its origin. Many of them relate to its lack of cometary activity, suggesting refractory
composition of 'Oumuamua. Here we explore the possibility that 'Oumuamua-like ISAs are produced
in tidal disruption events (TDEs) of refractory planetoids (asteroids, dwarf planets, etc.) by
the white dwarfs (WDs). This idea is supported by existing spectroscopic observations of metal-polluted
WDs, hinting at predominantly volatile-poor composition of accreted material. We show that such
TDEs sourced by realistic planetary systems (including a population of >1000 km planetoids and
massive perturbers - Neptune-to-Saturn mass planets) can eject to interstellar space up to 30%
of planetary mass involved in them. Collisional fragmentation, caused by convergent vertical
motion of the disrupted planetoid's debris inside the Roche sphere of the WD, channels most of the
original mass into 0.1-1 km fragments, similar to 'Oumuamua. Such size spectrum of ISAs (very different
from the top-heavy distributions expected in other scenarios) implies that every WD needs to eject
~0.3M_E of refractory material through TDEs (for ISA albedo of 0.2). This figure is consistent with
the existing observations of WD metal pollution once we account for observational biases by using
realistic models of circum-WD planetary systems. ISAs should exhibit kinematic characteristics
similar to old, dynamically hot Galactic populations; we interpret 'Oumuamua's slow Galactic
motion as a statistical fluctuation. ISA ejection in individual planetary TDEs is highly anisotropic,
resulting in large fluctuations of their space density. We also show that other ISA production mechanisms
involving stellar remnants - direct ejection by massive planets around WDs and SN explosions - have
difficulty explaining 'Oumuamua-like ISAs.
