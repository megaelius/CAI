Line shapes of the magnesium resonance lines in white dwarf spectra are determined by the properties
of magnesium atoms and the structure of the white dwarf atmosphere. Through their blanketing effect,
these lines have a dominant influence on the model structure and thus on the determination from the
spectra of other physical parameters that describe the stellar atmosphere and elemental abundances.
In continuation of previous work on Mg$^+$He lines in the UV, we present theoretical profiles of
the resonance line of neutral Mg perturbed by He at the extreme density conditions found in the cool
largely transparent atmosphere of DZ white dwarfs. We accurately determined the broadening of
Mg by He in a unified theory of collisional line profiles using ab initio calculations of MgHe potential
energies and transition matrix elements among the singlet electronic states that are involved
for the observable spectral lines. We computed the shapes and line parameters of the Mg lines and
studied their dependence on helium densities and temperatures. We present results over the full
range of temperatures from 4000 to 12000 K needed for input to stellar spectra models. Atmosphere
models were constructed for a range of effective temperatures and surface gravities typical for
cool DZ white dwarfs. We present synthetic spectra tracing the behavior of the Mg resonance line
profiles under the low temperatures and high gas pressures prevalent in these atmospheres. The
determination of accurate opacity data of magnesium resonance lines together with an improved
atmosphere model code lead to a good fit of cool DZ white dwarf stars. The broadening of spectral lines
by helium needs to be understood to accurately determine the H/He and Mg/He abundance ratio in DZ
white dwarf atmospheres. We emphasize that no free potential parameters or ad hoc adjustments were
used to calculate the line profiles.
