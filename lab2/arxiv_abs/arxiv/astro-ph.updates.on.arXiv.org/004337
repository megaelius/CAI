Context. Most popular algorithms in use to remove the effects of a telescope's point spread function
(PSF) in radio astronomy are variants of the CLEAN algorithm. Most of these algorithms model the
sky brightness using the delta-function basis, which results in undesired artefacts when used
on image extended emission. The adaptive scale pixel decomposition (Asp-Clean) algorithm models
the sky brightness on a scale-sensitive basis and thus gives a significantly better imaging performance
when imaging fields that contain both resolved and unresolved emission. Aims. However, the runtime
cost of Asp-Clean is higher than that of scale-insensitive algorithms. In this paper, we identify
the most expensive step in the original Asp-Clean algorithm and present an efficient implementation
of it, which significantly reduces the computational cost while keeping the imaging performance
comparable to the original algorithm. The PSF sidelobe levels of modern wide-band telescopes are
significantly reduced, allowing us to make approximations to reduce the computing cost, which
in turn allows for the deconvolution of larger images on reasonable timescales. Methods. As in the
original algorithm, scales in the image are estimated through function fitting. Here we introduce
an analytical method to model extended emission, and a modified method for estimating the initial
values used for the fitting procedure, which ultimately leads to a lower computational cost. Results.The
new implementation was tested with simulated EVLA data and the imaging performance compared well
with the original Asp-Clean algorithm. Tests show that the current algorithm can recover features
at different scales with lower computational cost.
