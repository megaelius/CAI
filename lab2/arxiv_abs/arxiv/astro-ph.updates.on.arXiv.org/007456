We study the non-linear evolution of the acoustic 'Resonant Drag Instability' (RDI) using numerical
simulations. The acoustic RDI is excited in a dust-gas mixture when dust grains stream through gas,
interacting with sound waves to cause a linear instability. We study this process in a periodic box
by accelerating neutral dust with an external driving force. The instability grows as predicted
by linear theory, eventually breaking into turbulence and saturating. As in linear theory, the
non-linear behavior is characterized by three regimes - high, intermediate, and low wavenumbers
- the boundary between which is determined by the dust-gas coupling strength and the dust-to-gas
mass ratio. The high and intermediate wavenumber regimes behave similarly to one another, with
large dust-to-gas ratio fluctuations while the gas remains largely incompressible. The saturated
state is highly anisotropic: dust is concentrated in filaments, jets, or plumes along the direction
of acceleration, with turbulent vortex-like structures rapidly forming and dissipating in the
perpendicular directions. The low-wavenumber regime exhibits large fluctuations in gas and dust
density, but the dust and gas remain more strongly coupled in coherent 'fronts' perpendicular to
the acceleration. These behaviors are qualitatively different from those of dust 'passively'
driven by external hydrodynamic turbulence, with no back-reaction force from dust onto gas. The
virulent nature of these instabilities has interesting implications for dust-driven winds in
a variety of astrophysical systems, including around cool-stars, in dusty torii around active-galactic-nuclei,
and in and around giant molecular clouds.
