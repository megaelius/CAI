Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations are rich tools to understand the build-up of stellar
mass and angular momentum in galaxies, but require some level of calibration to observations. We
compare predictions at $z\sim0$ from the Eagle, Hydrangea, Horizon-AGN, and Magneticum simulations
with integral field spectroscopic (IFS) data from the SAMI Galaxy Survey, ATLAS3D, CALIFA and MASSIVE
surveys. The main goal of this work is to simultaneously compare structural, dynamical, and stellar
population measurements in order to identify key areas of success and tension. We have taken great
care to ensure that our simulated measurement methods match the observational methods as closely
as possible. We find that the Eagle and Hydrangea simulations reproduce many galaxy relations but
with some offsets at high stellar masses. There are moderate mismatches in $R_e$ (+), $\epsilon$
(-), $\sigma_e$ (-), and mean stellar age (+), where a plus sign indicates that quantities are too
high on average, and minus sign too low. The Horizon-AGN simulations qualitatively reproduce several
galaxy relations, but there are a number of properties where we find a quantitative offset to observations.
Massive galaxies are better matched to observations than galaxies at low and intermediate masses.
Overall, we find mismatches in $R_e$ (+), $\epsilon$ (-), $\sigma_e$ (-) and $(V/\sigma)_e$ (-).
Magneticum matches observations well: this is the only simulation where we find ellipticities
typical for disk galaxies, but there are moderate differences in $\sigma_e$ (-), $(V/\sigma)_e$
(-) and mean stellar age (+). Our comparison between simulations and observational data has highlighted
several areas for improvement, such as the need for improved modelling resulting in a better vertical
disk structure, yet our results demonstrate the vast improvement of cosmological simulations
in recent years.
