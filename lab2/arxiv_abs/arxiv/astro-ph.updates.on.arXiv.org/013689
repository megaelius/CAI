We use recent 36 observational Hubble data (OHD) in the redshift range $0.07\leq z\leq 2.36$, latest
\textgravedbl joint light curves\textacutedbl (JLA) sample, comprised of 740 type Ia supernovae
(SNIa) in the redshift range $0.01\leq z \leq 1.30$, and their joint combination datasets to constrain
anisotropic Bianchi type I (BI) dark energy (DE) model. To estimate model parameters, we apply Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo technique. We also compute the covariance matrix for BI dark energy model by considering
different datasets to compare the correlation between model parameters. To check the acceptability
of our fittings, all results are compared with those obtained from 9 year WMAP as well as Planck (2015)
collaboration. Our estimations show that at 68\% confidence level the dark energy equation of state
(EOS) parameter for OHD or JLA datasets alone varies between quintessence and phantom regions whereas
for OHD+JLA dataset this parameter only varies in phantom region. It is also found that the current
cosmic anisotropy is of order $\sim10^{-3}$ which imply that the OHD and JLA datasets do not put tight
constraint on this parameter. Therefore, to constraint anisotropy parameter, it is necessary
to use high redshif dataset namely cosmic microwave background (CMB). Moreover, from the calculation
of $p$-value associated with $\chi^{2}$ statistic we observed that non of the $\omega \mbox{BI}$
and flat $\omega\mbox{CDM}$ models rule out by OHD or JLA datasets. The deceleration parameter
is obtained as $q=-0.46^{+0.89 +0.36}_{-0.41 -0.37}$, $q=-0.619^{+0.12 +0.20}_{-0.095 -0.24}$,
and $q=-0.52^{+0.080 +0.014}_{-0.046 -0.15}$ for OHD, SNIa, and OHD+SNIa data respectively.
