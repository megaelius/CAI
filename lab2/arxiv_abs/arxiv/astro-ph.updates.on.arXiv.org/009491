Using the IllustrisTNG simulations, we investigate the connection between galaxy morphology
and star formation in central galaxies with stellar masses in the range $10^9-10^{11.5}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$.
We quantify galaxy morphology by a kinematical decomposition of the stellar component into a spheroidal
and a disc component (spheroid-to-total ratio, S/T) and by the concentration of the stellar mass
density profile ($C_{82}$). S/T is correlated with stellar mass and star-formation activity,
while $C_{82}$ correlates only with stellar mass. Overall, we find good agreement with observational
estimates for both S/T and $C_{82}$. Low and high mass galaxies are dominated by random stellar motion,
while only intermediate-mass galaxies ($M_{\star}\approx10^{10}-10^{10.5}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$)
are dominated by ordered rotation. Whereas higher-mass galaxies are typical spheroids with high
concentrations, lower-mass galaxies have low concentration, pointing to different formation
channels. Although we find a correlation between S/T and star-formation activity, in the TNG model
galaxies do not necessarily change their morphology when they transition through the green valley
or when they cease their star formation, this depending on galaxy stellar mass and morphological
estimator. Instead, the morphology (S/T and $C_{82}$) is generally set during the star-forming
phase of galaxies. The apparent correlation between S/T and star formation arises because earlier-forming
galaxies had, on average, a higher S/T at a given stellar mass. Furthermore, we show that mergers
drive in-situ bulge formation in intermediate-mass galaxies and are responsible for the recent
spheroidal mass assembly in the massive galaxies with $M_{\star}>10^{11}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$.
In particular, these massive galaxies assemble about half of the spheroidal mass while star-forming
and the other half through mergers while quiescent.
