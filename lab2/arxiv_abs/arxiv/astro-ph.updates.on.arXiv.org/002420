We present the ultra-deep Subaru narrowband imaging survey for Lya emitters (LAEs) at $z=7.3$ in
SXDS and COSMOS fields with a total integration time of 106 hours. Exploiting our new sharp bandwidth
filter, NB101, installed on Suprime-Cam, we have reached $L(Lya)=2.4\times10^{42} \ erg \ s^{-1}$
($5\sigma$) for $z=7.3$ LAEs, about 4 times deeper than previous Subaru $z \gtrsim 7$ studies, which
allows us to reliably investigate evolution of Lya luminosity function (LF), for the first time,
down to the luminosity limit same as those of Subaru $z=3.1-6.6$ LAE samples. Surprisingly, we only
find three and four LAEs in SXDS and COSMOS fields, respectively, while one expects a total of $\sim
65$ LAEs by our survey in the case of no Lya LF evolution from $z=6.6$ to $7.3$.We identify a decrease
of Lya LF from $z=6.6$ to $7.3$ at the $>90\%$ confidence level from our $z=7.3$ Lya LF.Moreover,
the evolution of Lya LF is clearly accelerated at $z>6.6$ beyond the measurement uncertainties
including cosmic variance. Because no such accelerated evolution of UV-continuum LF or cosmic
star-formation rate (SFR) is found at $z\sim 7$, but suggested only at $z>8$ (Oesch et al. 2013,
Bouwens et al. 2014), this accelerated Lya LF evolution is explained by physical mechanisms different
from a pure SFR decrease but related to Lya production and escape in the process of cosmic reionization.
Because a simple accelerating increase of IGM neutral hydrogen absorbing Lya would not reconcile
with Thomson scattering optical depth measurements from WMAP and Planck, our findings may support
new physical pictures suggested by recent theoretical studies, such as the existence of HI clumpy
clouds within cosmic ionized bubbles selectively absorbing Lya and the large ionizing photon escape
fraction of galaxies making weak Lya emission.
