Sophisticated atmospheric retrieval algorithms, such as Nested Sampling, explore large parameter
spaces by iterating over millions of radiative transfer (RT) calculations. Probability distribution
functions for retrieved parameters are highly sensitive to assumptions made within the RT forward
model. One key difference between RT models is the computation of the gaseous absorption throughout
the atmosphere. We compare two methods of calculating gaseous absorption, cross-sections and
correlated-$k$, by examining their resulting spectra of a number of typical \ce{H2}-He dominated
exoplanetary and brown dwarf atmospheres. We also consider the effects of including \ce{H2}-He
pressure-broadening in some of these examples. We use NEMESIS to compute forward models. Our $k$-tables
are verified by comparison to ExoMol cross-sections provided online and a line-by-line calculation.
For test cases with typical resolutions ($\Delta \nu = 1$cm$^{-1}$), we show that the cross-section
method overestimates the amount of absorption present in the atmosphere and should be used with
caution. For mixed-gas atmospheres the morphology of the spectra changes, producing `ghost' features.
The two methods produce differences in flux of up to a few orders of magnitude. The addition of pressure
broadening of lines adds up to an additional order of magnitude change in flux. These effects are
more pronounced for brown dwarfs and secondary eclipse geometries. We note that correlated-$k$
can produce similar results to very high-resolution cross-sections, but is much less computationally
expensive. We conclude that inaccurate use of cross-sections and omission of pressure broadening
can be key sources of error in the modelling of brown dwarf and exoplanet atmospheres.
