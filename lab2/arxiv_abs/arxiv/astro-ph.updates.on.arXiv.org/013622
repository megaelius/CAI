We highlight a representative sample of active galactic nuclei selected independent of orientation.
The defining characteristic of the selection is sophisticated matching between the $0.1<z<0.6$
Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars from the Seventh Data Release to the Westerbork Northern Sky Survey
at 325 MHz and the subsequent application of a total radio luminosity cut. The resulting sample is
complete down to the limiting luminosity and unbiased by orientation. Compared to orientation
samples in the literature this approach yields less bias with redshift, relatively more lobe-dominated
sources including those with radio lobes and no visible core, and a distribution of radio core dominance
that is consistent with expectations from a uniform distribution of inclinations with solid angle.
We measure properties of the optical spectra, and use the sample to investigate the orientation
dependence of the velocity width of the broad H$\beta$ emission line. We recover the known orientation
dependence, but the sharp envelope of previous studies where only edge-on sources display the broadest
lines, is absent. Scatter in this diagram is not attributable solely to black hole mass, Eddington
ratio, or contamination in the sample from compact steep spectrum sources. A physical framework
for quasar beaming and a disk-like broad-line region can describe the representative sample when
it is expanded to include additional parameters, in particular jet properties and the broad-line
region velocity field. These points serve to illustrate the critical role of sample selection in
the interpretation of observable properties as indicators of physical parameters of quasar central
engines.
