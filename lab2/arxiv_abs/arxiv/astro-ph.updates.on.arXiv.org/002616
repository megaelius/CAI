A large number of low-mass (< 0.20 M_sun) helium white dwarfs (He WDs) have recently been discovered.
The majority of these are orbiting another WD or a millisecond pulsar (MSP) in a close binary system;
a few examples are found to show pulsations or to have a main-sequence star companion. There appear
to be discrepancies between the current theoretical modelling of such low-mass He WDs and a number
of key observed cases, indicating that their formation scenario remains to be fully understood.
Here we investigate the formation of detached proto-He WDs in close-orbit low-mass X-ray binaries
(LMXBs). Our prime focus is to examine the thermal evolution and the contraction phase towards the
WD cooling track and investigate how this evolution depends on the WD mass. Our calculations are
then compared to the most recent observational data. Numerical calculations with a detailed stellar
evolution code were used to trace the mass-transfer phase in a large number of close-orbit LMXBs.
Subsequently, we followed the evolution of the detached low-mass proto-He WDs, including stages
with residual shell hydrogen burning and vigorous flashes caused by unstable CNO burning. We find
that the time between Roche-lobe detachment until the low-mass proto-He WD reaches the WD cooling
track is typically Delta_t_proto = 0.5 - 2 Gyr, depending systematically on the WD mass and therefore
on its luminosity. The lowest WD mass for developing shell flashes is ~0.21 M_sun for progenitor
stars of mass M2 <= 1.5 M_sun (and ~0.18 M_sun for M2 = 1.6 M_sun). The long timescale of low-mass
proto-He WD evolution can explain a number of recent observations, including some MSP systems hosting
He WD companions with very low surface gravities and high effective temperatures. We find no evidence
for Delta_t_proto to depend on the occurrence of flashes and thus question the suggested dichotomy
in thermal evolution of proto-WDs.
