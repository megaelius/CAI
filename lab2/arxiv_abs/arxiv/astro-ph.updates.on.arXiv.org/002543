Core accretion models of massive star formation require the existence of stable massive starless
cores, but robust observational examples of such objects have proven elusive. We report subarcsecond-resolution
SMA 1.3 mm, 1.1 mm, and 0.88 mm and VLA 1.3 cm observations of an excellent massive starless core candidate,
G11.92-0.61-MM2, initially identified in the course of studies of GLIMPSE Extended Green Objects
(EGOs). Separated by ~7.2" from the nearby MM1 protostellar hot core, MM2 is a strong, compact dust
continuum source (submillimeter spectral index alpha=2.6+/-0.1), but is devoid of star formation
indicators. In contrast to MM1, MM2 has no masers, no centimeter continuum, and no (sub)millimeter
wavelength line emission in ~24 GHz of bandwidth observed with the SMA, including N2H+(3-2), HCO+(3-2),
and HCN(3-2). Additionally, there is no evidence for an outflow driven by MM2. The (sub)millimeter
spectral energy distribution (SED) of MM2 is best fit with a dust temperature of ~17-19 K and luminosity
of ~5-7 L_sun. The combined physical properties of MM2, as inferred from its dust continuum emission,
are extreme: M>30 M_sun within a radius<1000 AU, N(H2)>10^25 cm^-2 and n(H2)>10^9
cm^-3. Comparison of the molecular abundance limits derived from our SMA observations with gas-grain
chemical models indicates that extremely dense (n(H)>>10^8 cm^-3), cold (<20 K) conditions
are required to explain the lack of observed (sub)millimeter line emission, consistent with the
dust continuum results. Our data suggest that G11.92-0.61-MM2 is the best candidate for a bonafide
massive prestellar core found to date, and a promising target for future, higher-sensitivity observations.
