Aims: We investigate the temporal evolution of magnetic flux emergence in the quiet Sun atmosphere
close to disk center. Methods: We combine high-resolution SoHO/MDI magnetograms with TRACE observations
taken in the 1216 {\AA} channel in order to analyze the temporal evolution of an emerging small-scale
magnetic loop and its traces in the chromosphere. Results: At first place, we find signatures of
flux emergence very close to the edge of a supergranular network boundary located at disk center.
The new emerging flux appears first in the MDI magnetograms in form of an asymmetric bipolar element,
i.e. the patch with negative polarity is roughly two-times weaker than the corresponding patch
with opposite polarity. The average values of magnetic flux and magnetic flux densities reach 1.6
x 10^18 Mx, -8.5 x 10^17 Mx, and 55 Mx cm^-2, -30 Mx cm^-2, respectively. The spatial distance between
the opposite polarity patches of the emerged feature increases from about 2.5" to 5.0" during the
lifetime of the loop which was not longer than 36 min. A more precise lifetime-estimate of the feature
was not possible because of a gap in the temporal sequence of the MDI magnetograms. The chromospheric
response to the emerged magnetic dipole occurs ~ 9 minutes later with respect to the photospheric
magnetograms. It consists of a quasi-periodic sequence of time-localized brightenings visible
in the 1216 {\AA} TRACE channel apparent for ~ 14 minutes and being co-spatial with the axis connecting
the two patches of opposite magnetic polarity. Conclusions: We identify the observed event as a
small-scale magnetic loop emerging at photospheric layers and subsequently rising up to the chromosphere.
We discuss the possibility that the fluctuations detected in the chromospheric emission probably
reflect magnetic field oscillations which propagate to the chromosphere in form of waves.
