We report the first APOGEE metallicities and alpha-abundances measured for 3800 red giant stars
spanning a large radial range of both the Large (LMC) and Small Magellanic Clouds (SMC), the largest
Milky Way dwarf galaxies. Our sample is an order of magnitude larger than that of previous studies
and extends to much larger radial distances. These are the first results presented that make use
of the newly installed southern APOGEE instrument at the du Pont telescope at Las Campanas Observatory.
Our unbiased sample of the LMC spans a large range in metallicity from [Fe/H]=-0.2 to very metal poor
stars of [Fe/H]=-2.5, the most metal-poor Magellanic Clouds (MCs) stars detected to date. The LMC
[alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution is very flat over a large metallicity range but rises by ~0.1 dex
at the metal-rich end. We interpret this as a sign of the known recent increase in MC star formation
activity and are able to reproduce the pattern with a chemical evolution model that includes a recent
"starburst". This starburst phase is required to reproduce the flat alpha-abundance distributions
in both the LMC and SMC. At the metal-poor end, we capture the increase of [alpha/Fe] with decreasing
[Fe/H] and constrain the "alpha-knee" to [Fe/H]=-2.2 in both MCs implying a low SFE of ~0.01 Gyr^-1.
Counter-intuitively, the knee is more metal-poor than that of less massive Milky Way (MW) dwarf
galaxies such as Fornax or Sagittarius. One possible interpretation is that the MCs formed in a lower-density
environment than the MW, a hypothesis that is consistent with the paradigm that the MCs fell into
the MW potential only recently.
