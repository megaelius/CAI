We add a suite of chemical abundances to the MACER (Massive AGN Controlled Ellipticals Resolved)
2D code, by solving 12 additional continuity equations for H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Fe and Ni
respectively with sources from AGB stars and supernovae of type Ia and II with metal yields based
on standard stellar physics. New stars, formed in Toomre unstable circumnuclear disks (of a size
$\lesssim150$ parsec), are assumed to have a top-heavy initial mass function with a power index
of 1.65. The metal dilution effects due to cosmic accretion are also included. With the high resolution
of few parsecs in central regions, resolved black hole accretion and AGN feedback, we can track the
metal enrichment, transportation and dilution throughout the modeled massive elliptical galaxy
of velocity dispersion $\sim280$ km/s. We retrieve the chemical composition of the BAL winds launched
by the central AGN, synthesize the X-ray features of the hot ISM, and find that (1) the simulated metallicity
in the BAL winds could be up to $\sim 8 Z_\odot$, while that of the hot ISM in the host galaxy is $\sim
2.3 Z_\odot$, matching well with SDSS observations of BLR gas; (2) the X-ray emitting hot gas is metal
enriched with a typical value $\sim2.5 Z_\odot$; (3) the circumunuclear cold gas disk, where the
metals are condensed, further enriched and recycled, plays a critical role in the metal enrichment;
(4) the black hole accretion rate $\dot{M}_{\rm BH}$ linearly correlates with the star formation
rate $\dot{M}_\star^+$ in the circumnuclear disk, i.e, $\dot{M}_\star^+ \sim 7.7 \dot{M}_{\rm
BH}$, but lagged in time by roughly $10^6$ years.
