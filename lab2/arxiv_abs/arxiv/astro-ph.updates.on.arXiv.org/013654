To date weak gravitational lensing surveys have typically been restricted to small fields of view,
such that the $\textit{flat-sky approximation}$ has been sufficiently satisfied. However, with
Stage IV surveys ($\textit{e.g. LSST}$ and $\textit{Euclid}$) imminent, extending mass-mapping
techniques to the sphere is a fundamental necessity. As such, we extend the sparse hierarchical
Bayesian mass-mapping formalism presented in previous work to the spherical sky. For the first
time, this allows us to construct $\textit{maximum a posteriori}$ spherical weak lensing dark-matter
mass-maps, with principled Bayesian uncertainties, without imposing or assuming Gaussianty.
We solve the spherical mass-mapping inverse problem in the analysis setting adopting a sparsity
promoting Laplace-type wavelet prior, though this theoretical framework supports all log-concave
posteriors. Our spherical mass-mapping formalism facilitates principled statistical interpretation
of reconstructions. We apply our framework to convergence reconstruction on high resolution N-body
simulations with pseudo-Euclid masking, polluted with a variety of realistic noise levels, and
show a dramatic increase in reconstruction fidelity compared to standard approaches. Furthermore
we perform the largest joint reconstruction to date of all publically available shear observational
datasets (combining DESY1, KiDS450 and CFHTLens) and find that our formalism recovers a convergence
map with significantly enhanced small-scale detail. Within our Bayesian framework we validate,
in a statistically rigourous manner, the community's intuition regarding the need to smooth spherical
Kaiser-Squies estimates to provide physically meaningful convergence maps. Such approaches
cannot reveal the small-scale physical structures that we recover within our framework.
