We describe the Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) used for in-field testing of the POLARBEAR
receiver, an experiment located in the Atacama Desert of Chile which measures the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) polarization. The POLARBEAR-FTS (PB-FTS) is a Martin-Puplett interferometer
designed to couple to the Huan Tran Telescope (HTT) on which the POLARBEAR receiver is installed.
The PB-FTS measured the spectral response of the POLARBEAR receiver with signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) $>20$ for $\sim$69% of the focal plane detectors due to three features: a high throughput of
15.1 steradian cm$^{2}$, optimized optical coupling to the POLARBEAR optics using a custom designed
output parabolic mirror, and a continuously modulated output polarizer. The PB-FTS parabolic
mirror is designed to mimic the shape of the 2.5 m-diameter HTT primary reflector which allows for
optimum optical coupling to the POLARBEAR receiver, reducing aberrations and systematics. One
polarizing grid is placed at the output of the PB-FTS, and modulated via continuous rotation. This
modulation allows for decomposition of the signal into different harmonics that can be used to probe
potentially pernicious sources of systematic error in a polarization-sensitive instrument.
The high throughput and continuous output polarizer modulation features are unique compared to
other FTS calibrators used in the CMB field. In-field characterization of the POLARBEAR receiver
was accomplished using the PB-FTS in April 2014. We discuss the design, construction, and operation
of the PB-FTS and present the spectral characterization of the POLARBEAR receiver. We introduce
future applications for the PB-FTS in the next-generation CMB experiment, the Simons Array.
