We estimate the mass of the Milky Way (MW) within 21.1 kpc using the kinematics of halo globular clusters
(GCs) determined by Gaia. The second Gaia data release (DR2) contained a catalogue of absolute proper
motions (PMs) for a set of Galactic GCs and satellite galaxies measured using Gaia DR2 data. We select
from the catalogue only halo GCs, identifying a total of 34 GCs spanning $2.0 < r < 21.1$ kpc, and use
their 3D kinematics to estimate the anisotropy over this range to be $\beta = 0.48^{+0.15}_{-0.20}$,
in good agreement, though slightly lower than, a recent estimate for a sample of halo GCs using HST
PM measurements further out in the halo. We then use the Gaia kinematics to estimate the mass of the
MW inside the outermost GC to be $M(< 21.1 \mathrm{kpc}) = 0.22^{+0.04}_{-0.03} 10^{12} \mathrm{M_\odot}$,
which corresponds to a circular velocity of $v_\mathrm{circ}(21.1 \mathrm{kpc}) = 213^{+20}_{-17}$
km/s. The implied virial mass is $M_\mathrm{virial} = 1.41^{+1.99}_{-0.52} 10^{12} \mathrm{M_\odot}$.
The error bars encompass the uncertainties on the anisotropy and on the density profile of the MW
dark halo, and the shot noise inherent in the mass estimator we use. We get improved estimates when
we combine the Gaia and HST samples to provide kinematics for 46 GCs out to 39.5 kpc: $\beta = 0.52^{+0.12}_{-0.15}$,
$M(< 39.5 \mathrm{kpc}) = 0.44^{+0.07}_{-0.06} 10^{12} \mathrm{M_\odot}$, and $M_\mathrm{virial}
= 1.67^{+0.79}_{-0.50} 10^{12} \mathrm{M_\odot}$. We show that these results are robust to potential
substructure in the halo GC distribution. While a wide range of MW virial masses have been advocated
in the literature, from below $10^{12} \mathrm{M_\odot}$ to above $2 \times 10^{12}\mathrm{M_\odot}$,
these new data imply that an intermediate mass is most likely.
