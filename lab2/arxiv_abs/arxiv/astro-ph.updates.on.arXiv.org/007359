In an earlier campaign to characterize the mass of the transiting temperate super-Earth K2-18b
with HARPS, a second, non-transiting planet was posited to exist in the system at $\sim 9$ days. Further
radial velocity follow-up with the CARMENES spectrograph visible channel revealed a much weaker
signal at 9 days which also appeared to vary chromatically and temporally leading to the conclusion
that the origin of the 9 day signal was more likely to be related to stellar activity than to being planetary.
Here we conduct a detailed re-analysis of all available RV time-series, including a set of 31 previously
unpublished HARPS measurements, to investigate the effects of time-sampling and of simultaneous
modelling of planetary + activity signals on the existence and origin of the curious 9 day signal.
We conclude that the 9 day signal is real and was initially seen to be suppressed in the CARMENES data
due to a small number of anomalous measurements, although the exact cause of these anomalies remains
unknown. Investigation of the signal's evolution in time, with wavelength, and detailed model
comparison reveals that the 9 day signal is most likely planetary in nature. By this analysis, we
reconcile the conflicting HARPS and CARMENES results and measure precise and self-consistent
planet masses of $m_{p,b} = 8.63 \pm 1.35$ and $m_{p,c}\sin{i_c}=5.62 \pm 0.84$ M$_{\oplus}$.
This work, along with the previously published RV papers on the K2-18 planetary system, highlight
the importance of understanding one's time-sampling and of simultaneous planet + stochastic activity
modelling, particularly when searching for sub-Neptune-sized planets with radial velocities.
