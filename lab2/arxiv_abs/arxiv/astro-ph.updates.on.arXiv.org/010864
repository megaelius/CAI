We assemble an unbiased sample of 29 galaxies with [O II] $\lambda 3727$ and/or [O III] $\lambda 5007$
detections at $z < 0.15$ from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) Pilot
Survey (HPS). HPS finds galaxies without pre-selection based on their detected emission lines
via integral field spectroscopy. Sixteen of these objects were followed up with the second-generation,
low resolution spectrograph (LRS2) on the upgraded Hobby-Eberly Telescope. Oxygen abundances
were then derived via strong emission lines using a Bayesian approach. We find most of the galaxies
fall along the mass-metallicity relation derived from photometrically selected star forming
galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). However, two of these galaxies have low metallicity
(similar to the very rare green pea galaxies in mass-metallicity space). The star formation rates
of this sample fall in an intermediate space between the SDSS star forming main sequence and the extreme
green pea galaxies. We conclude that spectroscopic selection fills part of the mass-metallicity-SFR
phase space that is missed in photometric surveys with pre-selection like SDSS, i.e., we find galaxies
that are actively forming stars but are faint in continuum. We use the results of this pilot investigation
to make predictions for the upcoming unbiased, large spectroscopic sample of local line emitters
from HETDEX. With the larger HETDEX survey we will determine if galaxies selected spectroscopically
without continuum brightness pre-selection have metallicities that fall on a continuum that bridges
typical star forming and rarer, more extreme systems like green peas.
