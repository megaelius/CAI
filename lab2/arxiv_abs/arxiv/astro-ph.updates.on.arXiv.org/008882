One clear observational prediction of the single degenerate progenitor scenario as the origin
of type Ia supernovae (SNe) is the presence of relatively narrow ($\approx$1000 km s$^{-1}$) H$\alpha$
emission at nebular phases, although this feature is rarely seen. We present a compilation of nebular
phase H$\alpha$ limits for SN Ia in the literature and demonstrate that this heterogenous sample
has been biased towards SN Ia with relatively high luminosities and slow decline rates, as parameterized
by $\Delta$m$_{15}(B)$, the difference in $B$-band magnitude between maximum light and fifteen
days afterward. Motivated by the need to explore the full parameter space of SN~Ia and their subtypes,
we present two new and six previously published nebular spectra of SN Ia with $\Delta$m$_{15}(B)$$~>~$1.3
mag (including members of the transitional and SN1991bg-like subclasses) and measure nondetection
limits of $L_{H\alpha}$$~<~$0.85-9.9$\times$10$^{36}$ ergs s$^{-1}$, which we confirmed by
implanting simulated H$\alpha$ emission into our data. Based on the lastest models of swept-up
material stripped from a nondegenerate companion star, these $L_{H\alpha}$ values correspond
to hydrogen mass limits of $M_H$$~\lesssim~$1-3$\times$10$^{-4}$ $M_{\odot}$, roughly three
orders of magnitude below that expected for the systems modeled, although we note that no simulations
of H$\alpha$ nebular emission in such weak explosions have yet been performed. Despite the recent
detection of strong H$\alpha$ in SN~2018fhw ($\Delta$m$_{15}(B)$=2.0 mag), we see no evidence
that fast declining systems are more likely to have late time H$\alpha$ emission, although a larger
sample is needed to confirm this result.
