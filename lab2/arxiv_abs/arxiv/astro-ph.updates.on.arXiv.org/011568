We investigate whether the surfaces of the classical moons of Uranus are compositionally stratified,
with a thin veneer of mostly tiny H2O ice grains (<= 2 micron diameters) mantling a lower layer composed
of larger grains of H2O ice, dark material, and CO2 ice (~10 - 50 micron diameters). Near-infrared
observations (~1 - 2.5 microns) have determined that the H2O ice-rich surfaces of these moons are
overprinted by concentrated deposits of CO2 ice, found almost exclusively on their trailing hemispheres.
However, best fit spectral models of longer wavelength datasets (~3 - 5 microns) indicate that the
spectral signature of CO2 ice is largely absent, and instead, the exposed surfaces of these moons
are composed primarily of tiny H2O ice grains. To investigate possible compositional layering
of these moons, we have collected new data using the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) onboard the Spitzer
Space Telescope (~3 - 5 microns). Spectral modeling of these new data is consistent with prior analyses,
suggesting that the exposed surfaces of the Uranian moons are primarily composed of tiny H2O ice
grains. Furthermore, analysis of these new data reveal that the trailing hemispheres of these moons
are brighter than their leading hemispheres over the 3 to 5 micron wavelength range, except for Miranda,
which displays no hemispherical asymmetries in its IRAC albedos. Our analyses also revealed that
the surface of Ariel displays five distinct, regional-scale albedo zones, possibly consistent
with the spatial distribution of CO2 ice on this moon. We discuss possible processes that could be
enhancing the observed leading/trailing albedo asymmetries exhibited by these moons, as well
as processes that could be driving the apparent compositional stratification of their near surfaces.
