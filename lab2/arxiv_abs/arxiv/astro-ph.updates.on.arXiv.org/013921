We analyse luminosity-weighted ages and metallicity (Z) of galaxies in a continuous range of environments,
i.e. clusters, filaments and voids prevalent in the Coma supercluster ($\sim 100 h^{-1}$ Mpc).
Specifically, we employ two absorption line indices, H$\beta$ and $\langle\rm{Fe}\rangle$ as
tracers of age and metallicity of galaxies. We find that the stellar-phase metallicity of galaxies
declines with increasing age as a function of stellar mass ($M^*$) as well as environment. On the
filaments, metallicity of galaxies varies as a function of their distance from the spine of the filament,
such that galaxies closer to the centre of the filaments have lower metallicity relative to their
counterparts 1 Mpc away from it. The mean age of intermediate mass galaxies ($10^{10} < M^*/M_{\odot}
< 10^{10.5}$) galaxies is statistically significantly different in different environments such
that, the galaxies in clusters are older than the filament galaxies by 1-1.5 Gyr, while their counterparts
in the voids are younger than filament galaxies by $\sim 1$ Gyr. The massive galaxies ($M^*/M_{\odot}
> 10^{10.5}$), on the other hand show no such difference for the galaxies in clusters and filaments,
but their counterparts in voids are found to be younger by $\sim 0.5$ Gyr. At fixed age however, Z of
galaxies is independent of their $M^*$ in all environments, except the most massive ($M^*/M_{\odot}
\gtrsim 10^{10.7}$), oldest galaxies ($\gtrsim 9$ Gyr) which show a sharp decline in their Z with
$M^*$. Our results support a scenario where galaxies in the nearby Universe have grown by accreting
smaller galaxies or primordial gas from the large-scale cosmic web.
