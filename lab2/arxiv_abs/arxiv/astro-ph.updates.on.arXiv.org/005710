The EDGES experiment recently announced evidence for a broad absorption feature in the sky-averaged
radio spectrum around 78 MHz, as may result from absorption in the 21 cm line by neutral hydrogen at
z~15-20. If confirmed, one implication is that the spin temperature of the 21 cm line is coupled to
the gas temperature by z=20. The known mechanism for accomplishing this is the Wouthuysen-Field
effect, whereby Lyman-alpha photons scatter in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and impact the hyperfine
level populations. This suggests that early star formation had already produced a copious Lyman-alpha
background by z=20, and strongly constrains models in which the linear matter power spectrum is
suppressed on small-scales, since halo and star formation are delayed in such scenarios. Here we
consider the case that the dark matter consists of ultra-light axions with macroscopic de Broglie
wavelengths (fuzzy dark matter, FDM). We assume that star formation tracks halo formation and adopt
two simple models from the current literature for the halo mass function in FDM. We further suppose
that the fraction of halo baryons which form stars is less than a conservative upper limit of $f_\star
\leq 0.05$, and that ~10^4 Lyman-alpha to Lyman-limit photons are produced per stellar baryon.
We find that the requirement that the 21 cm spin temperature is coupled to the gas temperature by $z=20$
places a lower-limit on the FDM particle mass of $m_a \geq 5 \times 10^{-21} {\rm eV}$. The constraint
is insensitive to the precise minimum mass of halos where stars form. As the global 21 cm measurements
are refined, the coupling redshift could change and we quantify how the FDM constraint would be modified.
A rough translation of the FDM mass bound to a thermal relic warm dark matter (WDM) mass bound is also
provided.
