Gravity waves (or their signatures) are detected in stars thanks to helio- and asteroseismology
and they may play an important role in the evolution of stellar angular momentum. Moreover, the observational
study of the CoRoT target HD51452 by Neiner and collaborators demonstrated the potential strong
impact of rotation on the stochastic excitation of gravito-inertial waves in stellar interiors.
Our goal is to explore the action of rotation on the stochastic excitation of gravity and gravito-inertial
waves in stars. The dynamics of gravito-inertial waves in stellar interiors, both in radiation
and in convection zones, is described with a local non-traditional f-plane model. Their couplings
with convective turbulent flows is studied in this framework. First, we find that, in the super-inertial
regime in which the wave frequency is over twice the rotation frequency, the evanescence of gravito-inertial
waves in convective regions decreases with decreasing wave frequency. Next, in the sub-inertial
regime, gravito-inertial waves become purely propagative inertial waves in convection zones.
Simultaneously, turbulence in convective regions is modified by rotation. Indeed, the turbulent
energy cascade towards small scales is slowed down and in the case of rapid rotation, strongly anisotropic
turbulent flows are obtained that can be understood as complex non-linear triadic interactions
of propagative inertial waves. These different behaviours, due to the action of the Coriolis acceleration,
strongly modify the wave couplings with turbulent flows. On one hand, turbulence weakly influenced
by rotation is coupled with evanescent gravito-inertial waves. On the other hand, rapidly rotating
turbulence is intrinsically and strongly coupled with sub-inertial waves.
