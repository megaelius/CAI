ABRIDGED: 2D spectroscopic MUSE data for the whole extent of NGC3132 have been reduced and analised.
The dust extinction, electron densities and temperatures of the ionised gas and abundances were
determined. The nebula presents a complex reddening structure with high values (c(Hb)~0.4) at
the rim. Density maps are compatible with an inner high-ionisation plasma at moderate high density
(~1000cm^-3) while the low-ionisation plasma presents a structure in density peaking at the rim
with values ~700 cm^-3. Median Te using different diagnostics decreases according to the sequence
[NII],[SII]->[SIII]->[OI]->HeI->PJ. Likewise the range of Te covered by recombination lines
is much larger than those obtained from CELs, with large spatial variations within the nebula. If
these differences were due to the existence of high density clumps, these spatial variations suggest
changes in the properties and/or distribution of the clumps within the nebula. We determined a median
He/H=0.124. The range of measured ionic abundances for light elements are compatible with literature
values. Our kinematic analysis nicely illustrates the power of 2D kinematic information in many
emission lines to shed light on the intrinsic structure of the nebula. Our derived velocity maps
support a geometry for the nebula similar to the previously propose diabolo model, but oriented
with its major axis at P.A.~-22^o. We identified two low-surface brightness arc-like structures
towards the northern and southern tips of the nebula, with high extinction, high helium abundance,
and strong low-ionisation emission lines. They are spatially coincident with some extended low-surface
brightness mid-IR emission. The characteristics of the features are compatible with being the
consequence of precessing jets caused by the binary star system. This study illustrates the enormous
potential of IFS for the study of Galactic PNe.
