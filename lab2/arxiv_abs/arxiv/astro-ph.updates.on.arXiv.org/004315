Spatial association of clumps from different tracers turns out to be a valuable tool to determine
the physical properties of molecular clouds. It provides a reliable estimate for the $X$-factors,
serves to trace the density of clumps seen in column densities only and allows to measure the velocity
dispersion of clumps identified in dust emission. We study the spatial association between clump
populations, extracted by use of the GAUSSCLUMPS technique from $^{12}$CO (1-0), $^{13}$CO (1-0)
line maps and Herschel dust-emission maps of the star-forming region Rosette, and analyse their
physical properties. All CO clumps that overlap with another CO or dust counterpart are found to
be gravitationally bound and located in the massive star-forming filaments of the molecular cloud.
They obey a single mass-size relation $M_{\rm cl}\propto R_{\rm cl}^\gamma$ with $\gamma\simeq3$
(implying constant mean density) and display virtually no velocity-size relation. We interpret
their population as low-density structures formed through compression by converging flows and
still not evolved under the influence of self-gravity. The high-mass parts of their clump mass functions
are fitted by a power law ${\rm d}N_{\rm cl}/{\rm d}\,\log M_{\rm cl}\propto M_{\rm cl}^{\Gamma}$
and display a nearly Salpeter slope $\Gamma\sim-1.3$. On the other hand, clumps extracted from
the dust-emission map exhibit a shallower mass-size relation with $\gamma=2.5$ and mass functions
with very steep slopes $\Gamma\sim-2.3$ even if associated with CO clumps. They trace density peaks
of the associated CO clumps at scales of a few tenths of pc where no single density scaling law should
be expected.
