Mapping of the large-scale structure through cosmic time has numerous applications in the studies
of cosmology and galaxy evolution. At $z > 2$, the structure can be traced by the neutral intergalactic
medium (IGM) by way of observing the Ly$\alpha$, forest towards densely-sampled lines-of-sight
of bright background sources, such as quasars and star forming galaxies. We investigate the scientific
potential of MOSAIC, a planned multi-object spectrograph on the European Extremely Large Telescope
(ELT), for the 3D mapping of the IGM at $z \gtrsim 3$. We simulate a survey of $3 \lesssim z \lesssim
4$ galaxies down to a limiting magnitude of $m_{r}\sim 25.5$ mag in an area of 1 degree$^2$ in the sky.
Galaxies and their spectra (including the line-of-sight Ly$\alpha$ absorption) are taken from
the lightcone extracted from the Horizon-AGN cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. The quality
of the reconstruction of the original density field is studied for different spectral resolutions
and signal-to-noise ratios of the spectra. We demonstrate that the minimum $S/N$ (per resolution
element) of the faintest galaxies that such survey has to reach is $S/N = 4$. We show that a survey with
such sensitivity enables a robust extraction of cosmic filaments and the detection of the theoretically-predicted
galaxy stellar mass and star-formation rate gradients towards filaments. By simulating the realistic
performance of MOSAIC we obtain $S/N(T_{\rm obs}, R, m_{r})$ scaling relations. We estimate that
$\lesssim 35~(65)$ nights of observation time are required to carry out the survey with the instrument's
high multiplex mode and with the spectral resolution of $R=1000~(2000)$. A survey with a MOSAIC-concept
instrument on the ELT is found to enable the mapping of the IGM at $z > 3$ on Mpc scales, and as such will
be complementary to and competitive with other planned IGM tomography surveys. [abridged]
