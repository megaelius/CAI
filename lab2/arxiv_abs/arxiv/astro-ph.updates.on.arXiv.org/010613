This paper proposes a cloud architecture for the correlation of wide bandwidth VLBI data. Cloud
correlation facilitates processing of entire experiments in parallel using flexibly allocated
and practically unlimited compute resources. This approach offers a potential improvement over
dedicated correlation clusters, which are constrained by a fixed number of installed processor
nodes and playback units. Additionally, cloud storage offers an alternative to maintaining a fleet
of hard-disk drives that might be utilized intermittently. We describe benchmarks of VLBI correlation
using the DiFX-2.5.2 software on the Google Cloud Platform to assess cloud-based correlation performance.
The number of virtual CPUs per Virtual Machine was varied to determine the optimum configuration
of cloud resources. The number of stations was varied to determine the scaling of correlation time
with VLBI arrays of different sizes. Data transfer rates from Google Cloud Storage to the Virtual
Machines performing the correlation were also measured. We also present an example cloud correlation
configuration. Current cloud service and equipment pricing data is used to compile cost estimates
allowing an approximate economic comparison between cloud and cluster processing. The economic
comparisons are based on cost figures which are a moving target, and are highly dependent on factors
such as the utilization of cluster and media, which are a challenge to estimate. Our model suggests
that shifting to the cloud is an alternative path for high data rate, low duty cycle wideband VLBI
correlation that should continue to be explored. In the production phase of VLBI correlation, the
cloud has the potential to significantly reduce data processing times and allow the processing
of more science experiments in a given year for the petabyte-scale data sets increasingly common
in both astronomy and geodesy VLBI applications.
