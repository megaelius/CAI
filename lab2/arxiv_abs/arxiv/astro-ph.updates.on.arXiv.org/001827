The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect is one of the most promising tools we have for probing
the baryonic Universe. Unfortunately, the tSZ effect is defined as a line of sight projection of
the thermal pressure fluctuations of free-electrons, compromising our ability to probe the thermal
history of the Universe by smearing out the tSZ observables. This results in a loss of redshift information
diminishing the power of tSZ observations. It is hoped that by cross-correlating the tSZ effect
with external tracers we can recover a good fraction of the lost information. Weak lensing (WL) is
thought to provide a relatively unbiased probe of the dark Universe in 3D with many upcoming WL surveys
having sky coverage that overlaps with current tSZ surveys. Generalising the commonly used tomographic
approach, we advocate the use of the spherical Fourier-Bessel (sFB) expansion as a means to perform
a full analysis of cross-correlations between the projected (2D) tSZ Compton y-parameter maps
and 3D WL-convergence kappa maps. We use redshift dependent linear biasing and a halo model approach
for collapsed objects as a tool to investigate the tSZ-WL cross-correlations in 3D. We use both the
Press-Schechter (PS) as well as the Sheth-Tormen (ST) mass functions in our calculations, finding
that the results are sensitive to detailed modelling. We provide detailed analysis of surveys with
photometric redshifts. In the case of cross-correlation with redshift surveys, we provide detailed
estimates of the contributions from redshift-space distortions. The signal-to-noise (S/N) of
the cross-spectra C(k) for individual 3D modes, defined by the radial and tangential wave numbers
(k,l), remains comparable to but below unity with optimal binning expected to improve the situation.
The results presented here can be generalised to other CMB secondaries such as the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
(kSZ) effect.
