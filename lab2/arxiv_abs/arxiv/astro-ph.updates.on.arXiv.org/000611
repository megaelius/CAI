We present the discovery of eight new radio pulsars located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).
Five of these pulsars were found from reprocessing the Parkes Multibeam Survey of the Magellanic
Clouds, while the remaining three were from an ongoing new survey at Parkes with a high resolution
data acquisition system. It is possible that these pulsars were missed in the earlier processing
due to radio frequency interference, visual judgment, or the large number of candidates that must
be analysed. One of these new pulsars has a dispersion measure of 273 pc cm$^{-3}$, almost twice the
highest previously known value, making it possibly the most distant LMC pulsar. In addition, we
present the null result of a radio pulse search of an X-ray point source located in SNR J0047.2$-$7308
in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Although no millisecond pulsars have been found, these discoveries
have increased the known rotation powered pulsar population in the LMC by more than 50%. Using the
current sample of LMC pulsars, we used a Bayesian analysis to constrain the number of potentially
observable pulsars in the LMC to within a 95% credible interval of 57000$^{+70000}_{-30000}$.
The new survey at Parkes is $\sim$20% complete and it is expected to yield at most six millisecond
pulsars in the LMC and SMC. Although it is very sensitive to short period pulsars, this new survey
provides only a marginal increase in sensitivity to long periods. The limiting luminosity for this
survey is 125 mJy kpc$^2$ for the LMC which covers the upper 10% of all known radio pulsars. The luminosity
function for normal pulsars in the LMC is consistent with their counterparts in the Galactic disk.
The maximum 1400 MHz radio luminosity for LMC pulsars is $\sim 1000$ mJy kpc$^2$.
