The perturbations such as rotation and PC--current have been believed to be greatly affecting the
pulsar radio emission and polarization. The two effects have not been considered simultaneously
in the literature, however, each one of these has been considered separately and deduced the picture
by simply superposing them, but such an approach can lead to spurious results. Hence by considering
pulsar rotation and PC--current perturbations together instead of one at a time we have developed
a single particle curvature radiation model, which is expected to be much more realistic. By simulating
a set of typical pulse profiles we have made an attempt to explain most of the observational results
on pulsar radio emission and polarization. The model predicts that due to the perturbations leading
side component can become either stronger or weaker than the corresponding trailing one in any given
cone depending on the passage of sight line and modulation (nonuniform source distribution). Further
we find that the phase delay of polarization angle inflection point with respect to the core component
greatly depends upon the viewing geometry. The correlation between the sign reversal of circular
polarization and the polarization angle swing in the case of core dominated pulsars become obscure
once the perturbations and modulation become significant. However the correlation that the negative
circular polarization associates with the increasing polarization angle and vice versa shows
up very clearly in the case of conal-double pulsars. The `kinky' type distortions in polarization
angle swing could be due to the incoherent superposition of modulated emissions in the presence
of strong perturbations.
