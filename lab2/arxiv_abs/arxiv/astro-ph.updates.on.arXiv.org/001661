(Abridged) The growth of dust particles into planet embryos needs to circumvent the radial-drift
barrier, i.e. the accretion of dust particles onto the central star by radial migration. The outcome
of he dust radial migration is governed by simple criteria between the dust-to-gas ratio and the
exponents p and q of the surface density and temperature power-laws. The transfer of radiation provides
an additional constraint between these quantities as the disc thermal structure is fixed by the
dust spatial distribution. In order to assess which discs are preferentially affected by the radial-drift
barrier, we use the radiative transfer code MCFOST to compute the temperature structure of a large
range of disc models, stressing the particular effects of grain size distributions and vertical
settling. We find that the outcome of the dust migration process is very sensitive to the physical
conditions within the disc. For high dust-to-gas ratios (> 0.01) or flattened disc structures
(H/R < 0.05), growing dust grains can efficiently decouple from the gas, leading to a high concentration
of grains at a critical radius of a few AU. Decoupling of grains can occur at a large fraction (>
0.1) of the initial radius, for a dust-to-gas ratio larger than ~ 0.05. The exact value of the required
dust-to-gas ratio for dust to stop its migration is strongly dependent on the disc temperature structure.
Non growing dust grains are accreted for discs with flat surface density profiles (p<0.7) while
they always remain in the disc if the surface density is steep enough (p>1.2). Both the presence
of large grains and vertical settling tend to favour the accretion of non growing dust grains onto
the central object, but it slows down the migration of growing dust grains. Importantly, all the
disc configurations are found to have favourable temperature profiles over most of the disc to retain
their planetesimals.
