We have carried out and analyzed a set of axisymmetric MHD simulations of the evolution of a turbulent/diffusive
accretion disc around an initially unmagnetized star. The disc is initially threaded by a weak magnetic
field where the magnetic pressure is significantly less than the kinetic pressure in the disc. The
viscosity and magnetic diffusivity are modelled by two "alpha" parameters, while the coronal region
above the disc is treated using ideal MHD. The initial magnetic field is taken to consist of three
poloidal field loops threading the disc. The motivation for this study is to understand the advection
of disc matter and magnetic field by the turbulent/diffusive disc. At early times the innermost
field loop twists and its field lines become open. The twisting of the opened field lines leads to
the formation of both an inner collimated, magnetically-dominated jet, and at larger distances
from the axis a matter dominated uncollimated wind. For later times, the strength of the magnetic
field decreases owing to field reconnection and annihilation in the disc. For the early times, we
have derived from the simulations both the matter accretion speed in the disc and the accretion speed
of the magnetic field. We show that the derived matter accretion speed agrees approximately with
the predictions of a model where the accretion speed is the sum of two terms, one due to the disc's viscosity
(which gives a radial outflow of angular momentum in the disc), and a second due to the twisted magnetic
field at the disc's surface (which gives a vertical outflow of angular momentum). For early times
we find that the magnetic contribution is roughly twice the viscous contribution for the case where
the alpha parameters are both equal to 0.1. At later times the magnetic contribution to the matter
speed becomes small compared to the viscous contribution.
