The $^{12}$CO $(J=1\rightarrow0)$ velocity fields of a sample of 20 nearby spiral galaxies, selected
from the CO Multi-line Imaging of Nearby Galaxies (COMING) legacy project of Nobeyama Radio Observatory,
have been analyzed by Fourier decomposition to determine their basic kinematic properties, such
as circular and noncircular velocities. On average, the investigated barred (SAB and SB) galaxies
exhibit a ratio of noncircular to circular velocities of molecular gas larger by a factor of 1.5-2
than non-barred (SA) spiral galaxies at radii within the bar semimajor axis $a_\mathrm{b}$ at 1
kpc resolution, with a maximum at a radius of $R/a_\mathrm{b}\sim0.3$. Residual velocity field
images, created by subtracting model velocity fields from the data, reveal that this trend is caused
by kpc-scale streaming motions of molecular gas in the bar region. Applying a new method based on
radial velocity reversal, we estimated the corotation radius $R_\mathrm{CR}$ and bar pattern
speed $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$ in seven SAB and SB systems. The ratio of the corotation to bar radius
is found to be in a range of $\mathcal{R}\equiv R_\mathrm{CR}/a_\mathrm{b}\sim0.8\mathrm{-}1.6$,
suggesting that intermediate (SBb-SBc), luminous barred spiral galaxies host fast and slow rotator
bars. Tentative negative correlations are found for $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$ vs. $a_\mathrm{b}$
and $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$ vs. total stellar mass $M_\ast$, indicating that bars in massive disks
are larger and rotate slower, possibly a consequence of angular momentum transfer. The kinematic
properties of SAB and SB galaxies, derived from Fourier decomposition, are compared with recent
numerical simulations that incorporate various rotation curve models and galaxy interactions.
