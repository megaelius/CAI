The intracluster light (ICL) is a luminous component of galaxy clusters composed of stars that are
gravitationally bound to the cluster potential but do not belong to the individual galaxies. Previous
studies of the ICL have shown that its formation and evolution are intimately linked to the evolutionary
stage of the cluster. Thus, the analysis of the ICL in the Coma cluster will give insights into the
main processes driving the dynamics in this highly complex system. Using a recently developed technique,
we measure the ICL fraction in Coma at several wavelengths, using the J-PLUS unique filter system.
The combination of narrow- and broadband filters provides valuable information on the dynamical
state of the cluster, the ICL stellar types, and the morphology of the diffuse light. We use the Chebyshev-Fourier
Intracluster Light Estimator (CICLE) to disentangle the ICL from the light of the galaxies, and
to robustly measure the ICL fraction in seven J-PLUS filters. We obtain the ICL fraction distribution
of the Coma cluster at different optical wavelengths, which varies from $\sim 7\%-21\%$, showing
the highest values in the narrowband filters J0395, J0410, and J0430. This ICL fraction excess is
distinctive pattern recently observed in dynamically active clusters (mergers), indicating
a higher amount of bluer stars in the ICL compared to the cluster galaxies. Both the high ICL fractions
and the excess in the bluer filters are indicative of a merging state. The presence of younger/lower-metallicity
stars the ICL suggests that the main mechanism of ICL formation for the Coma cluster is the stripping
of the stars in the outskirts of infalling galaxies and, possibly, the disruption of dwarf galaxies
during past/ongoing mergers.
