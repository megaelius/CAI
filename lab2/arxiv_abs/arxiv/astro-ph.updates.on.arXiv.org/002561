We present clustering measurements and halo masses of star forming galaxies at 0.2 < z < 1.0.
After excluding AGN, we construct a sample of 22553 24 {\mu}m sources selected from 8.42 deg^2 of
the Spitzer MIPS AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey of Bo\"otes. Mid-infrared imaging allows us to
observe galaxies with the highest star formation rates (SFRs), less biased by dust obscuration
afflicting the optical bands. We find that the galaxies with the highest SFRs have optical colors
which are redder than typical blue cloud galaxies, with many residing within the green valley. At
z > 0.4 our sample is dominated by luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs, L_TIR > 10^11 Lsun) and
is comprised entirely of LIRGs and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs, L_TIR > 10^12
Lsun) at z > 0.6. We observe weak clustering of r_0 = 3-6 Mpc/h for almost all of our star forming
samples. We find that the clustering and halo mass depend on L_TIR at all redshifts, where galaxies
with higher L_TIR (hence higher SFRs) have stronger clustering. Galaxies with the highest SFRs
at each redshift typically reside within dark matter halos of M_halo ~ 10^12.9 Msun/h. This is consistent
with a transitional halo mass, above which star formation is largely truncated, although we cannot
exclude that ULIRGs reside within higher mass halos. By modeling the clustering evolution of halos,
we connect our star forming galaxy samples to their local descendants. Most star forming galaxies
at z < 1.0 are the progenitors of L < 2.5L* blue galaxies in the local universe, but star forming
galaxies with the highest SFRs (L_TIR >10^11.7 Lsun) at 0.6<z<1.0 are the progenitors
of early-type galaxies in denser group environments.
