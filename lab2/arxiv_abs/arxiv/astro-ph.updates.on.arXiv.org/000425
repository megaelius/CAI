Deep scaled array VLA 20 and 6cm observations including polarization of 19 Virgo spirals are presented.
This sample contains 6 galaxies with a global minimum of 20cm polarized emission at the receding
side of the galactic disk and quadrupolar type large-scale magnetic fields. In the new sample no
additional case of a ram-pressure stripped spiral galaxy with an asymmetric ridge of polarized
radio continuum emission was found. In the absence of a close companion, a truncated HI disk, together
with a ridge of polarized radio continuum emission at the outer edge of the HI disk, is a signpost of
ram pressure stripping. 6 out of the 19 observed galaxies display asymmetric 6cm polarized emission
distributions. Three galaxies belong to tidally interacting pairs, two galaxies host huge accreting
HI envelopes, and one galaxy had a recent minor merger. Tidal interactions and accreting gas envelopes
can lead to compression and shear motions which enhance the polarized radio continuum emission.
In addition, galaxies with low average star formation rate per unit area have a low average degree
of polarization. Shear or compression motions can enhance the degree of polarization. The average
degree of polarization of tidally interacting galaxies is generally lower than expected for a given
rotation velocity and star formation activity. This low average degree of polarization is at least
partly due to the absence of polarized emission from the thin disk. Ram pressure stripping can decrease
whereas tidal interactions most frequently decreases the average degree of polarization of Virgo
spiral galaxies. We found that moderate active ram pressure stripping has no influence on the spectral
index, but enhances the global radio continuum emission with respect to the FIR emission, while
an accreting gas envelope can but not necessarily enhances the radio continuum emission with respect
to the FIR emission.
