The objectives of this paper are to analyse molecular gas properties of the first substantial sample
of GRB hosts and test whether they are deficient in molecular gas. We obtained CO(2-1) observations
of seven GRB hosts with the APEX and IRAM30m telescopes. We analyse these data together with all other
hosts with previous CO observations. We obtained detections for three GRB hosts (980425, 080207
and 111005A) and upper limits for the remaining four (031203, 060505, 060814, 100316D). In our entire
sample of twelve CO-observed GRB hosts, three are clearly deficient in molecular gas, even taking
into account their metallicity (980425, 060814, and 080517). Four others are close to the best fit-line
for other star-forming galaxies on the SFR-MH2 plot (051022, 060505, 080207, and 100316D). One
host is clearly molecule-rich (111005A). Finally, for four GRB hosts the data is not deep enough
to judge whether they are molecule-deficient (000418, 030329, 031203, 090423). The median value
of the molecular gas depletion time, MH2/SFR, of GRB hosts is ~0.3 dex below that of other star-forming
galaxies, but this result has low statistical significance. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test performed
on MH2/SFR shows only ~2 sigma difference between GRB hosts and other galaxies. This difference
can partially be explained by metallicity effects, since the significance decreases to ~1 sigma
for MH2/SFR vs. metallicity. Thus the sample of GRB hosts has consistent molecular properties to
other galaxies, and can be treated as representative star-forming galaxies. Given the concentration
of atomic gas recently found close to GRB and supernova sites, indicating recent gas inflow, our
results imply that such inflow does not enhance the SFRs significantly, or that atomic gas converts
efficiently into the molecular phase.
