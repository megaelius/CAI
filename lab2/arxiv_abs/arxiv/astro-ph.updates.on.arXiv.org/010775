Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nanoparticles are expected to play an important role
in many astrophysical processes due to its dominant surface area, including gas heating, chemistry,
star formation , and anomalous microwave emission. In dense magnetized molecular clouds where
C-shocks are present, PAHs and nanoparticles are widely believed to originate from grain shattering
due to grain-grain collisions. The remaining question is whether these nanoparticles can survive
in the dense and hot shocked regions, and how to constrain their size and abundance with observations.
In this paper, we present a new mechanism to destroy nanoparticles in C-shocks based on centrifugal
stress within rapidly spinning nanoparticles spun-up by stochastic atomic bombardment, which
is termed rotational disruption. We find that, due to supersonic neutral gas-charged grain drift
in C-shocks, nanoparticles can be spun-up to suprathermal rotation by stochastic torques exerted
by supersonic neutral flow. The resulting centrifugal stress within suprathermally rotating
nanoparticles can exceed the maximum tensile strength of grain material ($S_{\max}$), resulting
in rapid disruption of nanoparticles smaller than $a\sim 1$ nm for $S_{\max}\sim 10^{9}\erg\cm^{-3}$.
The proposed disruption mechanism is shown to be more efficient than thermal sputtering in controlling
the lower cutoff of grain size distribution in C-shocks. We model microwave emission from spinning
nanoparticles in C-shocks subject to supersonic neutral drift and rotational disruption. We find
that suprathermally rotating nanoparticles can emit strong microwave radiation, and both peak
flux and peak frequency increase with increasing the shock velocity. We suggest spinning dust as
a new method to constrain nanoparticles and trace shock velocities in dense, shocked regions.
