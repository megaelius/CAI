Designed at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory the SL-method of stellar magnetic field measurement
is based on the calculation of the distance between the centers of gravity of the left and right circularly
polarized components of the spectral line. The SL-method is free from the limitations of the LSD-method,
namely its requirement for weak magnetic fields, weak spectral lines, the same shape of polarized
profiles. Also, this method is free from model limitations of the PCA, NDD and ZCD methods also. The
SL-method involves the calculation of the magnetic field using individual spectral lines and the
subsequent formation of uniform arrays of the magnetic field measurements. The formation of the
arrays is based on different criteria, e.g. using spectral lines of a chemical element, assumption
of the same physical conditions in the areas of the spectral line formation, a statistically significant
difference between the values of the magnetic field calculated from different arrays of spectral
lines etc. If there are several arrays of spectral lines, it is necessary to obtain normalized polarized
profiles using predetermined parameters for each array: the magnitude of the field, wavelength
for normalization, Lande factor and the central residual intensity of the line. In this paper, we
present a method of normalization of polarized profiles based on the dependence of the residual
intensity of the observed polarized profiles on their central residual intensity (COntour Algorithm
of the Line Approximation: COALA). The SL and COALA methods strong depend on the signal-to-noise
ratio and a number of used unblended spectral lines. In this work the application of the proposed
method is demonstrated for synthetic polarized spectra and for circularly polarized spectra of
the yellow subgiant $\beta$ Aql (Sp G8 IV) obtained on 2014 October 06.
