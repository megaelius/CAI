Future radio surveys will generate catalogues of tens of millions of radio sources, for which redshift
estimates will be essential to achieve many of the science goals. However, spectroscopic data will
be available for only a small fraction of these sources, and in most cases even the optical and infrared
photometry will be of limited quality. Furthermore, radio sources tend to be at higher redshift
than most optical sources and so a significant fraction of radio sources hosts differ from those
for which most photometric redshift templates are designed. We therefore need to develop new techniques
for estimating the redshifts of radio sources. As a starting point in this process, we evaluate a
number of machine-learning techniques for estimating redshift, together with a conventional
template-fitting technique. We pay special attention to how the performance is affected by the
incompleteness of the training sample and by sparseness of the parameter space or by limited availability
of ancillary multi-wavelength data. As expected, we find that the quality of the photometric-redshift
degrades as the quality of the photometry decreases, but that even with the limited quality of photometry
available for all sky-surveys, useful redshift information is available for the majority of sources,
particularly at low redshift. We find that a template-fitting technique performs best with high-quality
and almost complete multi-band photometry, especially if radio sources that are also X-ray emitting
are treated separately. When we reduced the quality of photometry to match that available for the
EMU all-sky radio survey, the quality of the template-fitting degraded and became comparable to
some of the machine learning methods. Machine learning techniques currently perform better at
low redshift than at high redshift, because of incompleteness of the currently available training
data at high redshifts.
