In this paper we search for distant massive companions to known transiting gas giant planets that
may have influenced the dynamical evolution of these systems. We present new radial velocity observations
for a sample of 51 planets obtained using the Keck HIRES instrument, and find statistically significant
accelerations in fifteen systems. Six of these systems have no previously reported accelerations
in the published literature: HAT-P-10, HAT-P-22, HAT-P-29, HAT-P-32, WASP-10, and XO-2. We combine
our radial velocity fits with Keck NIRC2 adaptive optics (AO) imaging data to place constraints
on the allowed masses and orbital periods of the companions responsible for the detected accelerations.
The estimated masses of the companions range between 1-500 M_Jup, with orbital semi-major axes
typically between 1-75 AU. A significant majority of the companions detected by our survey are constrained
to have minimum masses comparable to or larger than those of the transiting planets in these systems,
making them candidates for influencing the orbital evolution of the inner gas giant. We estimate
a total occurrence rate of 51 +/- 10% for companions with masses between 1-13 M_Jup and orbital semi-major
axes between 1-20 AU in our sample. We find no statistically significant difference between the
frequency of companions to transiting planets with misaligned or eccentric orbits and those with
well-aligned, circular orbits. We combine our expanded sample of radial velocity measurements
with constraints from transit and secondary eclipse observations to provide improved measurements
of the physical and orbital characteristics of all of the planets included in our survey.
