Evolution of close binaries often proceeds through the common envelope stage. The physics of the
envelope ejection (CEE) is not yet understood, and several mechanisms were suggested to be involved.
These could give rise to different timescales for the CEE mass-loss. Measuring the CEE timescales
can, therefore, probe the physical processes involved in CE. In order to probe the CEE-timescales
we study wide companions to post-CE binaries. Faster mass-loss timescales give rise to higher disruption
rates of wide binaries and result in larger average separations. Thereby, wide-binaries can provide
a unique probe for CEE mass-loss. We make use of data from Gaia DR2 to search for ultra-wide companions
(projected separations less than $2\times 10^5$ a.u.) to several types of post-CEE systems, including
sdBs, white-dwarf post-common binaries, and cataclysmic variables. We find a (wide-orbit) multiplicity
fraction of $1.4\pm 0.2$ per cent for sdBs to be compared with a multiplicity fraction of $5.0\pm
0.2$ per cent for late B and F stars which are possible sdB progenitors. The distribution of projected
separations of ultra-wide pairs to main sequence stars and sdBs differs significantly and is compatible
with prompt mass loss (upper limit on common envelope ejection timescale of $10^2$ years). The smaller
statistics of ultra-wide companions to cataclysmic variables and post-CEE post common-envelope
binaries provide weaker constraints. Nevertheless, the survival rate of ultra-wide pairs to the
cataclysmic variables (likely originating from more massive B-stars) suggest much longer, $\sim10^4$
years timescales for the CEE in these systems, possibly suggesting non-dynamical CEE in this regime.
