Small-scale fluctuations of different tracers of the interstellar the medium can be used to study
the nature of turbulence in astrophysical scales. Of these, the `continuum' emission traces the
fluctuations integrated along the line of sight whereas, the spectral line tracers give the information
along different velocity channels as well. Recently, Miville-Desch\^enes et al. (2016) have measured
the intensity fluctuation power spectrum of the continuum dust emission, and found a power law behaviour
with a power law index of $-2.9 \pm 0.1$ for a region of our Galaxy. Here, we study the same region using
high-velocity resolution 21-cm emission from the diffuse neutral medium, and estimate the power
spectrum at different spectral channels. The measured 21-cm power spectrum also follows a power
law, however, we see a significant variation in the power law index with velocity. The value of the
power-law index estimated from the integrated map for different components are quite different
which is indicative of the different nature of turbulence depending on temperature, density and
ionization fraction. We also measure the power spectra after smoothing the 21 cm emission to velocity
resolution ranging from $1.03$ to $13.39~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$, but the power spectrum remains unchanged
within the error bar. This indicates that the observed fluctuations are dominantly due to density
fluctuations, and we can only constrain the power-law index of velocity structure function of $0.0
\pm 1.1$ which is consistent with the predicted Kolmogorov turbulence $(\gamma=2/3)$ and also
with a shock-dominated medium $(\gamma=1.0)$.
