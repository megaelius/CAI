We study long-term thermal evolution of neutron stars in soft X-ray transients (SXTs), taking the
deep crustal heating into account consistently with the changes of the composition of the crust.
We collect observational estimates of average accretion rates and thermal luminosities of such
neutron stars and compare the theory with observations. We perform simulations of thermal evolution
of accreting neutron stars, considering the gradual replacement of the original nonaccreted crust
by the reprocessed accreted matter, the neutrino and photon energy losses, and the deep crustal
heating due to nuclear reactions in the accreted crust. We test and compare results for different
modern theoretical models. We update a compilation of the observational estimates of the thermal
luminosities in quiescence and average accretion rates in the SXTs and compare the observational
estimates with the theoretical results. Long-term thermal evolution of transiently accreting
neutron stars is nonmonotonic. The quasi-equilibrium temperature in quiescence reaches a minimum
and then increases toward the final steady state. The quasi-equilibrium thermal luminosity of
a neutron star in an SXT can be substantially lower at the minimum than in the final state. This enlarges
the range of possibilities for theoretical interpretation of observations of such neutron stars.
The updates of the theory and observations leave unchanged the previous conclusions that the direct
Urca process operates in relatively cold neutron stars and that an accreted heat-blanketing envelope
is likely present in relatively hot neutron stars in the SXTs in quiescence. The results of the comparison
of theory with observations favor suppression of the triplet pairing type of nucleon superfluidity
in the neutron-star matter.
