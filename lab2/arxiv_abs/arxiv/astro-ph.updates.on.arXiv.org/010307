While we have learned much about Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs) in groups and clusters, relatively
little is known about them in less-dense environments. More isolated UDGs are important for our
understanding of UDG formation scenarios because they form via secular mechanisms, allowing us
to determine the relative importance of environmentally-driven formation in groups and clusters.
We have used the public Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) together with the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic
Program (HSC-SSP) to constrain the abundance and properties of UDGs in the field, targeting sources
with low surface brightness (24.0$\leq$\bar{\mu}_{e,r}}$\leq$\26.5) and large apparent sizes
(3.0\arcsec$\leq$\bar{r}_{e,r}}$\leq$8.0\arcsec). Accounting for several sources of interlopers
in our selection based on canonical scaling relations, and using an empirical UDG model based on
measurements from the literature, we show that a scenario in which cluster-like red sequence UDGs
occupy a significant number of field galaxies is unlikely, with most field UDGs being significantly
bluer and showing signs of localised star formation. An immediate conclusion is that UDGs are much
more efficiently quenched in high-density environments. We estimate an upper-limit on the total
field abundance of UDGs of 8$\pm$3$\times10^{-3}$cMpc$^{-3}$ within our selection range. We
also compare the total field abundance of UDGs to a measurement of the abundance of HI-rich UDGs from
the literature, suggesting that they occupy at least one-fifth of the overall UDG population. The
mass formation efficiency of UDGs implied by this upper-limit is similar to what is measured in groups
and clusters.
