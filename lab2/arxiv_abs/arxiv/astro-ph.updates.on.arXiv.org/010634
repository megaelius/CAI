We present the first measurements of [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] abundances, obtained using spectral
synthesis modeling, for red giant branch stars in M31's giant stellar stream. The spectroscopic
observations, obtained at a projected distance of 17 kpc from M31's center, yielded 61 stars with
[Fe/H] measurements, including 21 stars with [$\alpha$/Fe] measurements, from 112 targets identified
as M31 stars. The [Fe/H] measurements confirm the expectation from photometric metallicity estimates
that stars in this region of M31's halo are relatively metal-rich compared to stars in the MW's inner
halo: more than half the stars in the field, including those not associated with kinematically identified
substructure, have [Fe/H] abundances $> -1.0$. The stars in this field are $\alpha$-enhanced at
lower metallicities, while [$\alpha$/Fe] decreases with increasing [Fe/H] above metallicities
of [Fe/H] $\gtrsim -0.9$. Three kinematical components have been previously identified in this
field: the giant stellar stream, a second kinematically cold feature of unknown origin, and M31's
kinematically hot halo. We compare probabilistic [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] distribution functions
for each of the components. The giant stellar stream and the second kinematically cold feature have
very similar abundance distributions, while the halo component is more metal-poor. Although the
current sample sizes are small, a comparison of the abundances of stars in the giant stellar stream
field with abundances of M31 halo and dSph stars from the literature indicate that the progenitor
of the stream was likely more massive, and experienced a higher efficiency of star formation, than
M31's existing dSphs or the dEs NGC147 and NGC185.
