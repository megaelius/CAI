Galaxy mergers are expected to have a significant role in the mass assembly of galaxies in the early
Universe, but there are very few observational constraints on the merger history of galaxies at
$z>2$. We present the first study of galaxy major mergers (mass ratios $>$ 1:4) in mass-selected
samples out to $z\approx6$. Using all five fields of the HST/CANDELS survey and a probabilistic
pair count methodology that incorporates the full photometric redshift posteriors and corrections
for stellar mass completeness, we measure galaxy pair-counts for projected separations between
5 and 30 kpc in stellar mass selected samples at $9.7 < \log_{10}(\rm{M}_{*}/\rm{M}_{\odot}) <
10.3$ and $\log_{10}(\rm{M}_{*}/\rm{M}_{\odot}) > 10.3$. We find that the major merger pair fraction
rises with redshift to $z\approx6$ proportional to $(1+z)^{m}$, with $m = 0.8\pm0.2$ ($m = 1.8\pm0.2$)
for $\log_{10}(\rm{M}_{*} / \rm{M}_{\odot}) > 10.3$ ($9.7 < \log_{10}(\rm{M}_{*}/\rm{M}_{\odot})
< 10.3$). Investigating the pair fraction as a function of mass ratio between 1:20 and 1:1, we find
no evidence for a strong evolution in the relative numbers of minor to major mergers out to $z<3$.
Using evolving merger timescales we find that the merger rate per galaxy ($\mathcal{R}$) rises
rapidly from $0.07\pm 0.01$ Gyr$^{-1}$ at $z < 1$ to $7.6\pm 2.7$ Gyr$^{-1}$ at $z = 6$ for galaxies
at $\log_{10}(\rm{M}_{*}/\rm{M}_{\odot}) > 10.3$. The corresponding co-moving major merger
rate density remains roughly constant during this time, with rates of $\Gamma \approx 10^{-4}$
Gyr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. Based on the observed merger rates per galaxy, we infer specific mass accretion
rates from major mergers that are comparable to the specific star-formation rates for the same mass
galaxies at $z>3$ - observational evidence that mergers are as important a mechanism for building
up mass at high redshift as in-situ star-formation.
