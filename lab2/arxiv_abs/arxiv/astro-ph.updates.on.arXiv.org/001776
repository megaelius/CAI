We search for the Fe K${\alpha}$ line in spectra of Ultra Compact X-ray Binaries (UCXBs). For this
purpose we have analyzed XMM-Newton observations of five confirmed UCXBs. We find that the object
2S 0918-549 - whose optical spectrum bears tentative signatures of a C/O accretion disk - is devoid
of any emission features in the 6-7 keV range, with an upper limit of less than 10 eV for the equivalent
width (EW) of the iron line. 4U 1916-05 - whose optical spectrum is consistent with reflection from
a He-rich accretion disk - exhibits a bright broad iron emission line. This behavior is in agreement
with the theoretical predictions presented in Koliopanos, Gilfanov and Bildsten (2013). Namely,
we expect strong suppression of the Fe K${\alpha}$ emission line in spectra originating in moderately
bright (LogLx less than $\approx$ 37.5) UCXBs with C/O or O/Ne/Mg-rich donors. On the other hand
the EW of the iron line in spectra from UCXBs with He-rich donors is expected to retain its nominal
value of $\approx$ 100 eV. Our analysis also reveals a strong Fe K${\alpha}$ line in the spectrum
of 4U 0614+091. This detection points towards a He-rich donor and seems to be at odds with the source's
classification as C/O-rich. Nevertheless, a He-rich donor would explain the bursting activity
reported for this system. Lastly, based on our theoretical predictions, we attribute the lack of
a strong iron emission line - in the two remaining UCXB sources in our sample (XTE J1807-294, 4U 0513-40)
- as an indication of a C/O or O/Ne/Mg white dwarf donor. From the upper limits of the Fe K${\alpha}$
line EW in 4U 0513-40, 2S 0918-549 and XTE J1807-294 we obtain a lower limit on the oxygen-to-iron
ratio,O/Fe$\ge$ 10$\times$[O/Fe]$_{\odot}$.
