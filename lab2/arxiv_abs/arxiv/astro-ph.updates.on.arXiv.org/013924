LDN 1157, is one of the several clouds situated in the cloud complex, LDN 1147/1158, represents a
coma-shaped morphology with a well-collimated bipolar outflow emanating from a Class 0 protostar,
LDN 1157-mm. The main goals of this work are (a) to map the inter-cloud magnetic field (ICMF) geometry
of the region surrounding LDN 1157 to investigate its relationship with the cloud morphology, with
the outflow direction and with the core magnetic field (CMF) geometry inferred from the mm- and sub-mm
polarization results from the literature, and (b) to investigate the kinematic structure of the
cloud. We carried out R-band polarization observations of the stars projected on the cloud to map
the pc-scale magnetic field geometry and made spectroscopic observations of the entire cloud in
12CO, C18O and N2H+ (J=1-0) lines to investigate its kinematic structure. We obtained a distance
of 340$\pm$3 pc to the LDN 1147/1158, complex based on the Gaia DR2 parallaxes and proper motion values
of the three YSOs associated with the complex. A single filament of $\sim1.2$ pc in length and $\sim0.09$
pc in width is found to run all along the coma-shaped cloud. Based on the relationships between the
ICMF, CMF, filament orientations, outflow direction, and the presence of an hour-glass morphology
of the magnetic field, it is likely that the magnetic field had played an important role in the star
formation process in LDN 1157. Combining the proper motions of the YSOs and the radial velocity of
LDN 1147/1158 and another complex LDN 1172/1174 which is situated $\sim2$\dgr~east of it, we found
that both the complexes are moving collectively toward the Galactic plane. The filamentary morphology
of the east-west segment of LDN 1157 may have formed as a result of mass lost by ablation due to the interaction
of the moving cloud with the ambient interstellar medium.
