Transition disks are considered sites of ongoing planet formation, and their dust and gas distributions
could be signposts of embedded planets. The transition disk around the T Tauri star RY Lup has an inner
dust cavity and displays a strong silicate emission feature. Using high-resolution imaging we
study the disk geometry, including non-axisymmetric features, and its surface dust grain, to gain
a better understanding of the disk evolutionary process. Moreover, we search for companion candidates,
possibly connected to the disk. We obtained high-contrast and high angular resolution data in the
near-infrared with the VLT/SPHERE extreme adaptive optics instrument whose goal is to study the
planet formation by detecting and characterizing these planets and their formation environments
through direct imaging. We performed polarimetric imaging of the RY~Lup disk with IRDIS (at 1.6
microns), and obtained intensity images with the IRDIS dual-band imaging camera simultaneously
with the IFS spectro-imager (0.9-1.3 microns). We resolved for the first time the scattered light
from the nearly edge-on circumstellar disk around RY~Lup, at projected separations in the 100 \,au
range. The shape of the disk and its sharp features are clearly detectable at wavelengths ranging
from 0.9 to 1.6 microns. We show that the observed morphology can be interpreted as spiral arms in
the disk. This interpretation is supported by in-depth numerical simulations. We also demonstrate
that these features can be produced by one planet interacting with the disk. We also detect several
point sources which are classified as probable background objects.
