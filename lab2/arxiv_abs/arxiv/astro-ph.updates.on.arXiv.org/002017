The stellar spin orientation relative to the orbital planes of multiplanet systems are becoming
accessible to observations. Here, we analyze and classify different types of spin-orbit evolution
in compact multiplanet systems perturbed by an inclined outer companion. Our study is based on classical
secular theory, using a vectorial approach developed in a separate paper. When planet-planet perturbations
are truncated at the second order in eccentricity and mutual inclination, and the planet-companion
perturbations are developed at the quadrupole order, the problem becomes integrable. The motion
is composed of a uniform precession of the whole system around the total angular momentum, and in
the rotating frame, the evolution is periodic. Here, we focus on the relative motion associated
to the oscillations of the inclination between the planet system and the outer orbit, and of the obliquities
of the star with respect to the two orbital planes. The solution is obtained using a powerful geometric
method. With this technique, we identify four different regimes characterized by the nutation
amplitude of the stellar spin-axis relative to the orbital plane of the planets. In particular,
the obliquity of the star reaches its maximum when the system is in the Cassini regime where planets
have more angular momentum than the star, and where the precession rate of the star is similar to that
of the planets induced by the companion. In that case, spin-orbit oscillations exceed twice the
inclination between the planets and the companion. Even if mutual inclination is only ~ 20 deg, this
resonant case can cause the spin-orbit angle to oscillate between perfectly aligned and retrograde
values.
