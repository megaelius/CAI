Primordial clouds are supposed to host the so-called population III stars. These stars are very
massive and completely metal-free. The final stage of the life of population III stars with masses
between 130 and 260 solar masses is a very energetic hypernova explosion. A hypernova drives a shock,
behind which a spherically symmetric very dense supershell forms, which might become gravitationally
unstable, fragment, and form stars. In this paper we study under what conditions can an expanding
supershell become gravitationally unstable and how the feedback of these supershell stars (SSSs)
affects its surroundings. We simulate, by means of a 1-D Eulerian hydrocode, the early evolution
of the primordial cloud after the hypernova explosion, the formation of SSSs, and the following
evolution, once the SSSs start to release energy and heavy elements into the interstellar medium.
Our results indicate that a shell, enriched with nucleosynthetic products from SSSs, propagates
inwards, towards the center of the primordial cloud. In a time span of a few Myr, this inward-propagating
shell reaches a distance of only a few parsec away from the center of the primordial cloud. Its density
is extremely high and its temperature very low, thus the conditions for a new episode of star formation
are achieved. We study what fraction of these two distinct populations of stars can remain bound
and survive until the present day. We study also under what conditions can this process repeat and
form multiple stellar populations. We extensively discuss whether the proposed scenario can help
to explain some open questions of the formation mechanism of globular clusters.
