We present a study of the star-formation rate (SFR)-density relation at z ~ 0.9 using data drawn from
the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey. We find that
SFR does depend on environment, but only for intermediate-stellar mass galaxies (10^10.1 < M* /
Msol < 10^10.8) wherein the median SFR at the highest densities is 0.2-0.3 dex less than at lower densities
at a significance of 4 sigma. Interestingly, mass does not drive SFR; galaxies that are more/less
massive have SFRs that vary at most by ~20% across all environments showing no statistically significant
dependence. We further split galaxies into low-redshift (z ~ 0.8) and high-redshift (z ~ 1.05) subsamples
and observe nearly identical behavior. We devise a simple toy model to explore possible star-formation
histories (SFHs) for galaxies evolving between these redshifts. The key assumption in this model
is that star-forming galaxies in a given environment-stellar mass bin can be described as a superposition
of two exponential timescales (SFR ~ e^(-t/tau)): a long-tau timescale with tau = 4 Gyr to simulate
"normal" star-forming galaxies, and a short-tau timescale with free tau (between 0.3 < tau/Gyr
< 2) to simulate galaxies on a quenching trajectory. In general we find that galaxies residing in
low/high environmental densities are more heavily weighted to the long-tau/short-tau pathways
respectively, which we argue is a signature of environmental quenching. Furthermore, for intermediate-stellar
mass galaxies this transition begins at intermediate-density environments suggesting that environmental
quenching is relevant in group-like halos and/or cluster infall regions.
