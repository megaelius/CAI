Context. A recent observational census of Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) has unveiled anomalous orbital
structures. This has led to the hypothesis that an additional $\sim5-10~m_{\oplus}$ planet exists.
This planet, known as Planet 9, occupies an eccentric and inclined orbit at hundreds of astronomical
units. However, the KBOs under consideration have the largest known semimajor axes at $a>250$ AU;
thus they are very difficult to detect.// Aims. In the context of the proposed Planet 9, we aim to measure
the mean plane of the Kuiper belt at $a>50$ AU. In a comparison of the expected and observed mean planes,
some constraints would be put on the mass and orbit of this undiscovered planet. Methods. We adopted
and developed the theoretical approach of Volk & Malhotra (2017) to the relative angle $\delta$
between the expected mean plane of the Kuiper belt and the invariable plane determined by the eight
known planets. Numerical simulations were constructed to validate our theoretical approach.
Then similar to Volk & Malhotra (2017), we derived the angle $\delta$ for the real observed KBOs with
$100<a<200$ AU, and the measurement uncertainties were also estimated. Finally, for comparison,
maps of the theoretically expected $\delta$ were created for different combinations of possible
Planet 9 parameters. Results. The expected mean plane of the Kuiper belt nearly coincides with the
said invariable plane interior to $a=90$ AU. But these two planes deviate noticeably from each other
at $a>100$ AU owing to the presence of Planet 9 because the relative angle $\delta$ could be as large
as $\sim10^{\circ}$. Using the $1\sigma$ upper limit of $\delta<5^{\circ}$ deduced from real
KBO samples as a constraint, we present the most probable parameters of Planet 9.
