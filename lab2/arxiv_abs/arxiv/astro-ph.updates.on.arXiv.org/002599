Large numbers of small opaque dust clouds - termed 'globulettes' by Gahm et al - have been observed
in the H II regions surrounding young stellar clusters. With masses typically in the planetary (or
low mass brown dwarf) regime, these objects are so numerous in some regions (e.g. the Rosette) that,
if only a small fraction of them could ultimately collapse, then they would be a very significant
source of free floating planets. Here we review the properties of globulettes and present a theoretical
framework for their structure and evolution. We demonstrate that their interior structure is well
described by a pressure confined isothermal Bonnor-Ebert sphere and that the observed mass-radius
relation (mass approximately proportional to the radius squared) is a systematic consequence
of a column density threshold below which components of the globulette are not identified. We also
find that globulettes with this interior structure are very stable against collapse within H II
regions. We follow Gahm et al in assuming that globulettes are detached from the tips of pillars protruding
in from the swept up shell that borders the expanding H II region and produce a model for their dynamics,
finding that globulettes will eventually impact the shell. We derive an expression for the time
it takes to do so and show that dissipation of energy via dust cooling allows all globulettes to survive
this encounter and escape into the wider ISM. Once there the ambient pressure drops and they disperse
on timescales around 30-300 kyr and should be observable using ALMA out to distances of order a parsec.
Since we find that globulettes are stable, the only route via which they might still form brown dwarfs
or planets is during their collision with the shell or some other violent perturbative event.
