We report on the implications for cosmic inflation of the 2018 Release of the Planck CMB anisotropy
measurements. The results are fully consistent with the two previous Planck cosmological releases,
but have smaller uncertainties thanks to improvements in the characterization of polarization
at low and high multipoles. Planck temperature, polarization, and lensing data determine the spectral
index of scalar perturbations to be $n_\mathrm{s}=0.9649\pm 0.0042$ at 68% CL and show no evidence
for a scale dependence of $n_\mathrm{s}.$ Spatial flatness is confirmed at a precision of 0.4% at
95% CL with the combination with BAO data. The Planck 95% CL upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio,
$r_{0.002}<0.10$, is further tightened by combining with the BICEP2/Keck Array BK14 data to obtain
$r_{0.002}<0.064$. In the framework of single-field inflationary models with Einstein gravity,
these results imply that: (a) slow-roll models with a concave potential, $V" (\phi) < 0,$ are increasingly
favoured by the data; and (b) two different methods for reconstructing the inflaton potential find
no evidence for dynamics beyond slow roll. Non-parametric reconstructions of the primordial power
spectrum consistently confirm a pure power law. A complementary analysis also finds no evidence
for theoretically motivated parameterized features in the Planck power spectrum, a result further
strengthened for certain oscillatory models by a new combined analysis that includes Planck bispectrum
data. The new Planck polarization data provide a stringent test of the adiabaticity of the initial
conditions. The polarization data also provide improved constraints on inflationary models that
predict a small statistically anisotropic quadrupolar modulation of the primordial fluctuations.
However, the polarization data do not confirm physical models for a scale-dependent dipolar modulation.
