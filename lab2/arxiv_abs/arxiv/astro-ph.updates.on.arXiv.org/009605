We have mapped the G287.84-0.82 cometary globule (with the Treasure Chest cluster embedded in it)
in the South Pillars region of Carina (i) in [CII], 63micron [OI], and CO(11-10) using upGREAT on
SOFIA and (ii) in J=2-1 transitions of CO, 13CO, C18O and J=3-2 transitions of H2CO using the APEX
telescope in Chile. We probe the morphology, kinematics, and physical conditions of the molecular
gas and the photon dominated regions (PDRs) in G287.84-0.82. The [CII] and [OI] emission suggest
that the overall structure of the pillar (with red-shifted photo evaporating tails) is consistent
with the effect of FUV radiation and winds from eta-Car and O stars in Trumpler 16. The gas in the head
of the pillar is strongly influenced by the embedded cluster, whose brightest member is an O9.5V
star, CPD-59 2661. The emission of the [CII] and [OI] lines peak at a position close to the embedded
star, while all other tracers peak at another position lying to the north-east consistent with gas
being compressed by the expanding PDR created by the embedded cluster. The molecular gas inside
the globule is probed with the J=2-1 transitions of CO and isotopologues as well as H2CO, and analyzed
using a non-LTE model (escape-probability approach), while we use PDR models to derive the physical
conditions of the PDR. We identify at least two PDR gas components; the diffuse part (~10^4 cm^-3)
is traced by [CII], while the dense (n~ 2-8x10^5 cm^-3) part is traced by [CII], [OI], CO(11-10).
Using the F=2-1 transition of [13CII] detected at 50 positions in the region, we derive optical depths
(0.9-5), excitation temperatures of [CII] (80-255 K), and N(C+) of 0.3-1x10^19 cm^-2. The total
mass of the globule is ~1000 Msun, about half of which is traced by [CII]. The dense PDR gas has a thermal
pressure of 10^7-10^8 K cm^-3, which is similar to the values observed in other regions.
