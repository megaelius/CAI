We observationally investigate the relation between the photoelectric heating efficiency in
PDRs and the charge of PAHs, which are considered to play a key role in photoelectric heating. Using
PACS onboard Herschel, we observed six PDRs spanning a wide range of FUV radiation fields (G_0=100-10^5).
To measure the photoelectric heating efficiency, we obtained the intensities of the main cooling
lines, i.e., the [OI]63um, 145um, and [CII]158um, as well as the FIR continuum intensity. We used
Spitzer/IRS spectroscopic mapping observations to investigate the MIR PAH features in the same
regions. We decomposed the MIR PAH emission into that of neutral (PAH^0) and positively ionized
(PAH^+) species to derive the fraction of the positively charged PAHs, and compare it to the photoelectric
heating efficiency. The heating efficiency traced by ([OI]63um+[OI]145um+[CII]158um) / TIR,
ranges between 0.1% and 0.9% in different sources, and the fraction of PAH^+ relative to (PAH^0 +
PAH^+) spans from 0(+11)% to 87(+/-10)%. All positions with a high PAH^+ fraction show a low heating
efficiency, and all positions with a high heating efficiency have a low PAH^+ fraction, supporting
the scenario in which a positive grain charge results in a decreased heating efficiency. Theoretical
estimates of the photoelectric heating efficiency show a stronger dependence on the charging parameter
gamma=G_0 T^{1/2}/n_e than the observed efficiency reported in this study, and the discrepancy
is significant at low gamma. The photoelectric heating efficiency on PAHs, traced by ([OI]63um+[OI]145um+[CII]158um)
/ (PAH+[OI]63um+[OI]145um+[CII]158um), shows a much better match between the observations and
the theoretical estimates. The good agreement of the photoelectric heating efficiency on PAHs
with a theoretical model indicates the dominant contribution of PAHs to the photoelectric heating.
