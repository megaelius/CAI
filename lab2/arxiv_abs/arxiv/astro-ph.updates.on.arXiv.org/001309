Solar flares are associated with intense soft X-ray emission generated by the hot flaring plasma
in coronal magnetic loops. Kink unstable twisted flux-ropes provide a source of magnetic energy
which can be released impulsively and account for the heating of the plasma in flares. We investigate
the temporal, spectral and spatial evolution of the properties of the thermal X-ray emission produced
in such kink-unstable magnetic flux-ropes using a series of MHD simulations. We deduce emission
diagnostics and their temporal evolution and discuss the results of the simulations with respect
to observations. The numerical setup used consists of a highly twisted loop embedded in a region
of uniform and untwisted background coronal magnetic field. We let the kink instability develop,
compute the evolution of the plasma properties in the loop (density, temperature) and deduce the
X-ray emission properties of the plasma during the whole flaring episode. During the initial phase
of the instability plasma heating is mostly adiabatic. Ohmic diffusion takes over as the instability
saturates, leading to strong and quick heating (> 15 MK), to a strong peak of X-ray emission and
to the hardening of the thermal X-ray spectrum. The magnetic flux-rope reconnects with the background
flux and relaxes to a lower energy state. The total thermal X-ray emission then slowly fades away
as the loop plasma cools down. The emission pattern is often filamentary and the amount of twist deduced
from the X-ray emission alone is considerably lower than the maximum twist in the simulated flux-ropes.
The simulated X-ray emission reveals a multi-thermal plasma with an emission measure (EM) which
depends on the temperature. The EM evolves into a bi-modal distribution as a function of temperature
during the saturation phase and later converges to the power-law distribution $\mathrm{EM}\propto
T^{-4.2}$ during the relaxation phase.
