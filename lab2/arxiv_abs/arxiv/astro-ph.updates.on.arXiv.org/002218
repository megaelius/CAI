Maximizing the grating efficiency is a key goal for the first light instrument IRIS (Infrared Imaging
Spectrograph) currently being designed to sample the diffraction limit of the TMT (Thirty Meter
Telescope). Volume Phase Holographic (VPH) gratings have been shown to offer extremely high efficiencies
that approach 100% for high line frequencies (i.e., 600 to 6000l/mm), which has been applicable
for astronomical optical spectrographs. However, VPH gratings have been less exploited in the
near-infrared, particularly for gratings that have lower line frequencies. Given their potential
to offer high throughputs and low scattered light, VPH gratings are being explored for IRIS as a potential
dispersing element in the spectrograph. Our team has procured near-infrared gratings from two
separate vendors. We have two gratings with the specifications needed for IRIS current design:
1.51-1.82{\mu}m (H-band) to produce a spectral resolution of 4000 and 1.19- 1.37 {\mu}m (J-band)
to produce a spectral resolution of 8000. The center wavelengths for each grating are 1.629{\mu}m
and 1.27{\mu}m, and the groove densities are 177l/mm and 440l/mm for H-band R=4000 and J-band R=8000,
respectively. We directly measure the efficiencies in the lab and find that the peak efficiencies
of these two types of gratings are quite good with a peak efficiency of ~88% at the Bragg angle in both
TM and TE modes at H-band, and 90.23% in TM mode, 79.91% in TE mode at J-band for the best vendor. We determine
the drop in efficiency off the Bragg angle, with a 20-23% decrease in efficiency at H-band when 2.5
degree deviation from the Bragg angle, and 25%-28% decrease at J-band when 5{\deg} deviation from
the Bragg angle.
