High-dispersion spectroscopic monitoring of HESS J0632+057 has been carried out over four orbital
cycles in order to search for orbital modulation, covering the entire orbital phase. We have measured
radial velocity of H$\alpha$ emission line with the method introduced by Shafter et al. (1986),
which has been successfully applied to some Be stars. The velocity is seen to increase much earlier
than expected for the orbital period of 315 days, and much more steeply than expected at around "apastron".
The period of the H$\alpha$ modulation is found to be as $308^{+26}_{-23}$ days. We have also analyzed
Swift/XRT data from 2009 to 2015 to study the orbital modulation, selecting the data with good statistics
($\geq$ 30 counts). With additional two-year data to the previous works, the orbital period has
been updated to $313^{+11}_{-8}$ days, which is consistent with the previous X-ray periods and
the spectroscopic one. The past XMM-Newton and Chandra observations prefer the period of 313 days.
With the new period, assuming that H$\alpha$ velocities accurately trace the motion of the Be star,
we have derived a new set of the orbital parameters. In the new orbit, which is less eccentric ($e \sim
0.6$), two outbursts occur after apastron, and just after periastron. Besides, the column density
in bright phase ($4.7^{+0.9}_{-08}\times10^{21}\;\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$) is higher than in faint
phase ($2.2\pm0.5\times10^{21}\;\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$). These facts suggest that outbursts occur
when the compact object passes nearby/through the Be disk. The mass function implies that mass of
the compact object is less than 2.5 $\mathrm{M_{sun}}$ assuming that the mass of the Be star is 13.2--18.2
$\mathrm{M_{sun}}$ (Aragona at al. 2010) unless the inclination is extremely small. The photon
index indicates that the spectra becomes softer when the system is bright. These suggest that the
compact object is a pulsar.
