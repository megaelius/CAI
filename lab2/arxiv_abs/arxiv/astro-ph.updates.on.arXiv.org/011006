Previous studies based on the analysis of Gaia DR2 data have revealed that accreted stars, possibly
originating from a single progenitor satellite, are a significant component of the halo of our Galaxy,
potentially constituting most of the halo stars at $\rm [Fe/H] < -1$ within a few kpc from the Sun and
beyond. In this paper, we couple astrometric data from Gaia DR2 with elemental abundances from APOGEE
DR14 to characterize the kinematics and chemistry of in-situ and accreted populations up to $\rm
[Fe/H] \sim -2$. Accreted stars appear to significantly impact the Galactic chemo-kinematic relations,
not only at $\rm [Fe/H] < -1$, but also at metallicities typical of the thick and metal-poor thin discs.
They constitute about 60% of all stars at $\rm [Fe/H] < -1$, the remaining 40% being made of (metal-weak)
thick disc stars. We find that the stellar kinematic fossil record shows the imprint left by this
accretion event which heated the old Galactic disc. We are able to age-date this kinematic imprint,
showing that the accretion occurred between 9 and 11 Gyr ago, and that it led to the last significant
heating of the Galactic disc. An important fraction of stars with abundances typical of the (metal-rich)
thick disc, and heated by this interaction, is now found in the Galactic halo. Indeed about half of
the kinematically defined halo at few kpc from the Sun is composed of metal-rich thick disc stars.
Moreover, we suggest that this metal-rich thick disc component dominates the stellar halo of the
inner Galaxy. The new picture that emerges from this study is one where the standard non-rotating
in-situ halo population, the collapsed halo, seems to be more elusive than ever.
