The recent demonstration of a real-time direct imaging radio interferometry correlator represents
a new capability in radio astronomy \citep{kent_real-time_2019}. However the issue of wide field
imaging with this method is considerable, with wide-field effects and array non-coplanarity degrading
image quality if not compensated for. Here we present an alternative direct imaging correlation
strategy using a Direct Fourier Transform (DFT), modelled as a linear operator facilitating a matrix
multiplication between the DFT matrix and a vector of the electric fields from each antenna. This
offers perfect correction for wide field and non-coplanarity effects. When implemented with data
from the Long Wavelength Array (LWA), it offers comparable computational performance to previously
demonstrated direct imaging techniques, despite having a theoretically higher floating point
cost. It also has additional benefits, such as imaging sparse arrays and control over which sky co-ordinates
are imaged, allowing variable pixel placement across an image. It is in practice a highly flexible
and efficient method of direct radio imaging when implemented on suitable arrays. A functioning
Electric Field Direct imaging architecture using the DFT is presented, alongside an exploration
of techniques for wide-field imaging similar to those in visibility based imaging, and an explanation
of why they do not fit well to imaging directly with the digitized electric field data. The DFT imaging
method is demonstrated on real data from the LWA telescope, alongside a detailed performance analysis,
as well as an exploration of its applicability to other arrays.
