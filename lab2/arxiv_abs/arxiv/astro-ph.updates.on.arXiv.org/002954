The current generation of experiments aiming to detect the neutral hydrogen signal from the Epoch
of Reionisation (EoR) is likely to be limited by systematic effects associated with removing foreground
sources from target fields. In this paper we develop a model for the compact foreground sources in
one of the target fields of the MWA's EoR key science experiment: the `EoR1' field. The model is based
on both the MWA's GLEAM survey and GMRT 150 MHz data from the TGSS survey, the latter providing higher
angular resolution and better astrometric accuracy for compact sources than is available from
the MWA alone. The model contains 5049 sources, some of which have complicated morphology in MWA
data, Fornax A being the most complex. The higher resolution data show that 13% of sources that appear
point-like to the MWA have complicated morphology such as double and quad structure, with a typical
separation of 33~arcsec. We derive an analytic expression for the error introduced into the EoR
two-dimensional power spectrum due to peeling close double sources as single point sources and
show that for the measured source properties, the error in the power spectrum is confined to high
$k_\bot$ modes that do not affect the overall result for the large-scale cosmological signal of
interest. The brightest ten mis-modelled sources in the field contribute 90% of the power bias in
the data, suggesting that it is most critical to improve the models of the brightest sources. With
this hybrid model we reprocess data from the EoR1 field and show a maximum of 8% improved calibration
accuracy and a factor of two reduction in residual power in $k$-space from peeling these sources.
Implications for future EoR experiments including the SKA are discussed in relation to the improvements
obtained.
