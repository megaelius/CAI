We present James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array 2 (SCUBA-2)
850 \& 450 $\mu$m observations ($\sigma_{850}\sim0.5$ mJy, $\sigma_{450}\sim5$ mJy) of the HS1549+19
and HS1700+64 survey fields containing two of the largest known galaxy over-densities at $z=2.85$
and $2.30$, respectively. We detect 56 sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) with SNR $> 4$ over $\sim
50$ arcmin$^2$ at 850 $\mu$m with flux densities of 3 -- 17 mJy. The number counts indicate over-densities
in the $1$-arcmin radius core region ($\sim 500$ kpc) of $6^{+4}_{-2}\times$ (HS1549) and $4^{+6}_{-2}\times$
(HS1700) over that of blank field surveys. Within these core regions, we spectroscopically confirm
that approximately two thirds of the SMGs lie at the protocluster redshifts for both HS1549 and HS1700.
We use statistical identifications of other SMGs in the wider fields to constrain an additional
four candidate protocluster members in each system. We combine multi wavelength estimates of the
star-formation rates (SFRs) from Lyman-break dropout- and narrowband-selected galaxies, and
the SCUBA-2 SMGs, to estimate total SFRs of 12,$500\pm2800$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ ($4900\pm1200$
M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) in HS1549 (HS1700), and SFR densities (SFRDs) within the centre of each protocluster
to be $3000\pm900$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ ($1300\pm400$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$)
in the HS1549 (HS1700) protocluster, $\sim10^4\times$ larger than the global SFRDs found at their
respective epochs, due to the concentration of star-forming galaxies in the small volume of the
dense cluster cores. Our results suggest centrally concentrated starbursts within protoclusters
may be a relatively common scenario for the build up of mass in rich clusters assembling at $z\gtrsim2$.
