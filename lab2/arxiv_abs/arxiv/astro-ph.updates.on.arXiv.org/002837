The processes leading to dust formation and the subsequent role it plays in driving mass loss in cool
evolved stars is an area of intense study. Here we present high resolution ALMA Science Verification
data of the continuum emission around the highly evolved oxygen-rich red supergiant VY CMa. These
data enable us to study the dust in its inner circumstellar environment at a spatial resolution of
129 mas at 321 GHz and 59 mas at 658 GHz, thus allowing us to trace dust on spatial scales down to 11 R$_{\star}$
(71 AU). Two prominent dust components are detected and resolved. The brightest dust component,
C, is located 334 mas (61 R$_{\star}$) South East of the star and has a dust mass of at least $2.5\times
10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$. It has a dust emissivity spectral index of $\beta =-0.1$ at its peak, implying
that it is optically thick at these frequencies with a cool core of $T_{d}\lesssim 100$ K. Interestingly,
not a single molecule in the ALMA data has emission close to the peak of this massive dust clump. The
other main dust component, VY, is located at the position of the star and contains a total dust mass
of $4.0 \times 10^{-5} $M$_{\odot}$. It also contains a weaker dust feature extending over $60$
R$_{\star}$ to the North with the total component having a typical dust emissivity spectral index
of $\beta =0.7$. We find that at least $17\%$ of the dust mass around VY CMa is located in clumps ejected
within a more quiescent roughly spherical stellar wind, with a quiescent dust mass loss rate of $5
\times 10^{-6}$ M$_{\odot} $yr$^{-1}$. The anisotropic morphology of the dust indicates a continuous,
directed mass loss over a few decades, suggesting that this mass loss cannot be driven by large convection
cells alone.
