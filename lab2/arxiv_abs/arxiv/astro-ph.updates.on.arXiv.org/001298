The study of exoplanetary atmospheres epitomises a continuous quest for higher accuracy measurements.
Systematic effects and noise associated with both the stellar activity and the instrument can bias
the results and thus limit the precision of the analysis. To reach a high photometric and spectroscopic
precision, it is therefore essential to correct for these effects. We present here a novel non-parametric
approach, named Gaussian Process method for Star Characterization (GPSC), to remove effects of
stellar activity and instrumental systematics on planetary signals, with a view to preserve the
atmospheric contribution which can be as small as 10$^{-4}$ or even 10$^{-5}$ the flux of the star.
We applied our method to data recorded with Kepler, focussing on a sample of lightcurves with different
effective temperatures and flux modulations. We found that GPSC can very effectively correct for
the short and long term stellar activity and instrumental systematics. Additionally we run the
GPSC on both real and simulated transit data, finding transit depths consistent with the original
ones. Consequently we considered 10 hours of continuous observations: daily, every other day and
weekly, and we used the GPSC to reconstruct the lightcurves. When data are recorded more frequently
than once every five days we found that our approach is able to extrapolate the stellar flux at the
10$^{-4}$ level compared to the full stellar flux. These results show a great potential of GPSC to
isolate the relevant astrophysical signal and achieve the precision needed for the correction
of short and long term stellar activity.
