This review presents a comprehensive overview of galaxy bias, that is, the statistical relation
between the distribution of galaxies and matter. We focus on large scales where cosmic density fields
are quasi-linear. On these scales, the clustering of galaxies can be described by a perturbative
bias expansion, and the complicated physics of galaxy formation is absorbed by a finite set of coefficients
of the expansion, called bias parameters. The review begins with a detailed derivation of this very
important result, which forms the basis of the rigorous perturbative description of galaxy clustering,
under the assumptions of General Relativity and Gaussian, adiabatic initial conditions. Key components
of the bias expansion are all leading local gravitational observables, which include the matter
density but also tidal fields and their time derivatives. We hence expand the definition of local
bias to encompass all these contributions. This derivation is followed by a presentation of the
peak-background split in its general form, which elucidates the physical meaning of the bias parameters,
and a detailed description of the connection between bias parameters and galaxy statistics. We
then review the excursion-set formalism and peak theory which provide predictions for the values
of the bias parameters. In the remainder of the review, we consider the generalizations of galaxy
bias required in the presence of various types of cosmological physics that go beyond pressureless
matter with adiabatic, Gaussian initial conditions: primordial non-Gaussianity, massive neutrinos,
baryon-CDM isocurvature perturbations, dark energy, and modified gravity. Finally, we discuss
how the description of galaxy bias in the galaxies' rest frame is related to clustering statistics
measured from the observed angular positions and redshifts in actual galaxy catalogs.
