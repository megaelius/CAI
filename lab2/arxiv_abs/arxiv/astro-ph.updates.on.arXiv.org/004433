The galactic environment has been suspected to influence planetary habitability in many ways.
Very metal-poor regions of the Galaxy, or those largely devoid of atoms more massive than H and He,
are thought to be unable to form habitable planets. Moreover, if such planets do form, the young system
is subjected to close stellar passages while it resides in its stellar birth cluster. Various potential
hazards remain after clusters disperse. For instance, central galactic regions may present risks
to habitability via nearby supernovae, gamma ray bursts (GRBs), and frequent comet showers. In
addition, planets residing within very wide binary star systems are affected by the Galaxy, as local
gravitational perturbations from the Galaxy can increase the binary's eccentricity until it destabilizes
the planets it hosts. Here we review the most recent work on the main galactic influences over planetary
habitability. Although there must be some metallicity limit below which rocky planets cannot form,
recent exoplanet surveys show that they form around stars with a very large range of metallicities.
Once formed, the probability of star clusters destabilizing planetary systems only becomes high
for rare, extremely long-lived clusters. Regarding threats to habitability from supernovae,
GRBs, and comet showers, many recent studies suggest that their hazards are more limited than originally
thought. Finally, denser regions of the Galaxy enhance the threat that very wide binary companions
pose to planetary habitability, but the probability that a very wide binary star disrupts habitability
will always be substantially below 100% for any environment. While some Milky Way regions must be
more hospitable to habitable planets than others, it is difficult to state that habitable planets
are confined to any well-defined region of the Galaxy or that any other particular region of the Galaxy
is uninhabitable.
