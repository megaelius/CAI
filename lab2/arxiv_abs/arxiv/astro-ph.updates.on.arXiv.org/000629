The motion of a point mass in the J2 problem is generalized to that of a rigid body in a J2 gravity field.
The linear and nonlinear stability of the classical type of relative equilibria of the rigid body,
which have been obtained in our previous paper, are studied in the framework of geometric mechanics
with the second-order gravitational potential. Non-canonical Hamiltonian structure of the problem,
i.e., Poisson tensor, Casimir functions and equations of motion, are obtained through a Poisson
reduction process by means of the symmetry of the problem. The linear system matrix at the relative
equilibria is given through the multiplication of the Poisson tensor and Hessian matrix of the variational
Lagrangian. Based on the characteristic equation of the linear system matrix, the conditions of
linear stability of the relative equilibria are obtained. The conditions of nonlinear stability
of the relative equilibria are derived with the energy-Casimir method through the projected Hessian
matrix of the variational Lagrangian. With the stability conditions obtained, both the linear
and nonlinear stability of the relative equilibria are investigated in details in a wide range of
the parameters of the gravity field and the rigid body. We find that both the zonal harmonic J2 and
the characteristic dimension of the rigid body have significant effects on the linear and nonlinear
stability. Similar to the classical attitude stability in a central gravity field, the linear stability
region is also consisted of two regions that are analogues of the Lagrange region and the DeBra-Delp
region respectively. The nonlinear stability region is the subset of the linear stability region
in the first quadrant that is the analogue of the Lagrange region. Our results are very useful for
the studies on the motion of natural satellites in our solar system.
