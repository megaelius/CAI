Context: Detecting moons around exoplanets is a major goal of current and future observatories.
Moons are suspected to influence rocky exoplanet habitability, and gaseous exoplanets in stellar
habitable zones could harbour abundant and diverse moons to target in the search for extraterrestrial
habitats. Exomoons will contribute to exoplanetary signals but are virtually undetectable with
current methods. Aims: We identify and analyse traces of exomoons in the temporal variation of total
and polarised fluxes of starlight reflected by an Earth-like exoplanet and its spatially unresolved
moon across all phase angles, with both orbits viewed in an edge-on geometry. Methods: We compute
the total and linearly polarised fluxes, and the degree of linear polarization P of starlight that
is reflected by the exoplanet with its moon along their orbits, accounting for the temporal variation
of the visibility of the planetary and lunar disks, and including effects of mutual transits and
mutual eclipses. Our computations pertain to a wavelength of 450 nm. Results: Total flux F shows
regular dips due to planetary and lunar transits and eclipses. Polarization P shows regular peaks
due to planetary transits and lunar eclipses, and P can increase and/or slightly decrease during
lunar transits and planetary eclipses. Changes in F and P will depend on the radii of the planet and
moon, on their reflective properties, and their orbits, and are about one magnitude smaller than
the smooth background signals. The typical duration of a transit or an eclipse is a few hours. Conclusions:
Traces of an exomoon due to planetary and lunar transits and eclipses show up in F and P of sunlight
reflected by planet-moon systems and could be searched for in exoplanet flux and/or polarisation
phase functions.
