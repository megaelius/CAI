In this paper we obtain observational constraints on three dynamical cold dark energy models ,include
PL , CPL and FSL, with most recent cosmological data and investigate their implication for structure
formation, dark energy clustering and abundance of CMB local peaks. From the joint analysis of the
CMB temperature power spectrum from observation of the Planck, SNIa light-curve, baryon acoustic
oscillation, $f\sigma_8$ for large scale structure observations and the Hubble parameter, the
PL model has the highest growth of matter density, $ \Delta_{m} $, and matter power spectrum, $ P(k)
$, compared to $\Lambda$CDM and other models. For the CPL on the other hand, the structure formation
is considerably suppressed while the FSL has behavior similar to standard model of cosmology. Studying
the clustering of dark energy, $ \Delta_{DE}$, yields positive but small value with maximum of $
\Delta_{DE}\simeq10^{-3} $ at early time due to matter behaviour of the PL, while for the CPL and
FSL cross $ \Delta_{DE}=0 $ several time which demonstrate void of dark energy with $ \Delta_{DE}\simeq-10^{-11}
$ in certain periods of the history of dark energy evolution. Among these three models, the PL model
demonstrate that is more compatible with $ f\sigma_{8} $ data. We also investigated a certain geometrical
measure, namely the abundance of local maxima as a function of threshold for three DDE models and
find that the method is potentially capable to discriminate between the models, especially far
from mean threshold. The contribution of PL and CPL for late ISW are significant compared to cosmological
constant and FSL model. The tension in the Hubble parameters is almost alleviated in the PL model.
