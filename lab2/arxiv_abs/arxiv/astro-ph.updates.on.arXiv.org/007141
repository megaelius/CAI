ZZ Ceti stars are pulsating white dwarfs with a carbon-oxygen core (or possibly ONe for the most massive
stars) build up during the core helium burning (CHeB) and thermally pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch
(TP-AGB) phases. Through the interpretation of their pulsation periods by means of asteroseismology,
details about their origin and evolution can be inferred. The whole pulsation spectrum exhibited
by ZZ Ceti stars strongly depend on the inner chemical structure. At present, there are several processes
affecting the chemical profiles that are still not accurately determined. We present a study of
the impact of current uncertainties in the evolution of white dwarf progenitor on the expected pulsation
properties and on the stellar parameters inferred from asteroseismological fits of ZZ Ceti stars.
Our analysis is based on a set of carbon-oxygen core white dwarf models that are derived from full
evolutionary computations from the ZAMS to the ZZ Ceti domain. We considered models in which we varied
the number of thermal pulses, the amount of overshooting, and the carbon-alpha reaction rate within
their uncertainties. We explore the impact of these major uncertainties in prior evolution on the
chemical structure and expected pulsation spectrum. We find that these uncertainties yield significant
changes in the g-mode pulsation periods being those found during the TP-AGB phase the most relevant
for the pulsational properties and the asteroseismological derived stellar parameters of ZZ Ceti
stars. We conclude that the uncertainties in the white dwarf progenitor evolution should be taken
into account in detailed asteroseismological analyses of these pulsating stars.
