We use Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), AKARI, and Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX)
data to select local analogs of high-redshift (z~2) dust obscured galaxies (DOGs). We identify
47 local DOGs with S_{12\mu m}/S_{0.22 \mu m}>892 and S_{12\mu m}>20 mJy at 0.05<z<0.08
in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 7. The infrared luminosities of these DOGs are in the
range 3.4x10^{10} (L_\odot)<L_{IR}<7.0x10^{11} (L_\odot) with a median L_{IR} of 2.1x10^{11}
(L_\odot). We compare the physical properties of local DOGs with a control sample of galaxies that
have lower $S_{12\mu m}/S_{0.22 \mu m}$ but have similar redshift, IR luminosity, and stellar mass
distributions. Both WISE 12 micron and GALEX near-ultraviolet (NUV) flux densities of DOGs differ
from the control sample of galaxies, but the difference is much larger in the NUV. Among the 47 DOGs,
36\pm7% have small axis ratios in the optical (i.e., b/a<0.6), larger than the fraction among
the control sample (17\pm3%). There is no obvious sign of interaction for many local DOGs. No local
DOGs have companions with comparable optical magnitudes closer than ~50 kpc. The large- and small-scale
environments of DOGs are similar to the control sample. Many physical properties of local DOGs are
similar to those of high-z DOGs, even though the IR luminosities of local objects are an order of magnitude
lower than for the high-z objects: the presence of two classes (active galactic nuclei- and star
formation-dominated) of DOGs, abnormal faintness in the UV rather than extreme brightness in the
mid-infrared, and diverse optical morphology. These results suggest a common underlying physical
origin of local and high-z DOGs. Both seem to represent the high-end tail of the dust obscuration
distribution resulting from various physical mechanisms rather than a unique phase of galaxy evolution.
