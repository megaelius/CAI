Context. The combined use of carbon radio recombination lines (CRRLs) and the 158 $\mu$m-[CII]
line is a powerful tool for the study of the energetics and physical conditions (e.g., temperature
and density) of photodissociation regions (PDRs). However, there are few observational studies
that exploit this synergy. Aims. Here we explore the relation between CRRLs and the 158 $\mu$m-[CII]
line in light of new observations and models. Methods. We present new and existing observations
of CRRLs in the frequency range 0.15--230 GHz with ALMA, VLA, the GBT, Effelsberg 100m, and LOFAR
towards Orion~A (M42). We complement these observations with SOFIA observations of the 158 $\mu$m-[CII]
line. We studied two PDRs: the foreground atomic gas, known as the Veil, and the dense PDR between
the HII region and the background molecular cloud. Results. In the Veil we are able to determine the
gas temperature and electron density, which we use to measure the ionization parameter and the photoelectric
heating efficiency. In the dense PDR, we are able to identify a layered PDR structure at the surface
of the molecular cloud to the south of the Trapezium cluster. There we find that the radio lines trace
the colder portion of the ionized carbon layer, the C$^{+}$/C/CO interface. By modeling the emission
of the $158$~$\mu$m-[CII] line and CRRLs as arising from a PDR we derive a thermal pressure $>5\times10^{7}$
K cm$^{-3}$ and a radiation field $G_{0}\approx10^{5}$ close to the Trapezium. Conclusions. This
work provides additional observational support for the use of CRRLs and the 158 $\mu$m-[CII] line
as complementary tools to study dense and diffuse PDRs, and highlights the usefulness of CRRLs as
probes of the C$^{+}$/C/CO interface.
