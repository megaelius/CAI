The goal of this work is to study the cool, active binary star $\sigma^2$ CrB, focussing on its magnetic
field. We used Stokes $IV$ data from the twin spectropolarimeters Narval at the TBL and ESPaDOnS
at the CFHT. The least-squares deconvolution multi-line technique was used to increase the signal-to-noise
ratio of the data. We then applied a new binary Zeeman-Doppler imaging code to reconstruct simultaneously
the magnetic topology and brightness distribution of both components. This analysis was carried
out for two observational epochs in 2014 and 2017. A previously unconfirmed magnetic field of the
primary star has been securely detected. The polarisation signatures of the secondary appear to
have a systematically larger amplitude than that of the primary. This corresponds to a stronger
magnetic field, for which the magnetic energy of the secondary exceeds that of the primary by a factor
of 3.3-5.7. While the magnetic energy is similar for the secondary star in the two epochs, the magnetic
energy is about twice as high in 2017 for the primary. The magnetic field topology of the two stars
in the earlier epoch (2014) is very different. In the earlier epoch, the magnetic field at the visible
pole appears to be of opposite polarity for the primary and secondary, suggesting linked magnetospheres.
The apparent rotational periods of both $\sigma^2$ CrB components are longer than the orbital period,
which we interpret as an evidence of a solar-like differential rotation. Despite their nearly identical
fundamental parameters, the components of $\sigma^2$ CrB system exhibit different magnetic field
properties. This indicates that the magnetic dynamo process is a very sensitive function of stellar
parameters.
