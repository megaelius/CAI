We present the results from a systematic search and characterization of ionized outflows in nearby
galaxies using the data from the second Data Release of the MaNGA Survey (DR2; > 2700 galaxies, z <
0.015). Using the spatially-resolved spectral information provided by the MANGA data, we have
identified ~5200 Halpha-emitting regions across the galaxies and searched for signatures of ionized
outflows. We find evidence for ionized outflows in 105 regions from 103 galaxies, roughly 7% of all
the Halpha-emitting galaxies identified in this work. Our analysis allows us to study ionized outflows
in individual regions with SFRs down to ~0.01 Msun yr-1, extending the ranges probed by previous
works. The kinematics of the outflowing gas are strongly linked to the type of ionization mechanism:
regions characterized by LIER emission host outflows with more extreme kinematics (FWHM_broad
~900 km/s), followed by those originated in AGN (~550 km/s), `Intermediate' (~450 km/s) and SF (~350
km/s) regions. Moreover, in most of the outflows we find evidence for gas ionized by shocks. We find
a trend for higher outflow kinematics towards larger stellar masses of the host galaxies but no significant
variation as a function of star formation. The fraction of outflowing gas that can escape from galaxies
decreases towards higher dynamical masses, contributing to the preservation of the mass-metallicity
relation by regulating the amount of metals in galaxies. Finally, assuming that the extensions
of the outflows are significantly larger than the individual star-forming regions, as found in
previous works, our results also support the presence of star formation within ionized outflows,
as recently reported by Maiolino et al. 2017 and Gallagher et al. 2019.
