Studying large-scale environments of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies gives a new perspective
on their properties, particularly their radio loudness. The large-scale environment is believed
to have an impact on the evolution and intrinsic properties of galaxies, however, NLS1 sources have
not been studied in this context before. We have a large and diverse sample of 1341 NLS1 galaxies and
three separate environment data sets constructed using Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We use various
statistical methods to investigate how the properties of NLS1 galaxies are connected to the large-scale
environment, and compare the large-scale environments of NLS1 galaxies with other active galacic
nuclei (AGN) classes, for example, other jetted AGN and broad-line Seyfert 1 (BLS1) galaxies, to
study how they are related. NLS1 galaxies reside in less dense environments than any of the comparison
samples, thus confirming their young age. The average large-scale environment density and environmental
distribution of NLS1 sources is clearly different compared to BLS1 galaxies, thus it is improbable
that they could be the parent population of NLS1 galaxies and unified by orientation. Within the
NLS1 class there is a trend of increasing radio loudness with increasing large-scale environment
density, indicating that the large-scale environment affects their intrinsic properties. Our
results suggest that the NLS1 class of sources is not homogeneous, and furthermore, a considerable
fraction of them are misclassified. We further support a published proposal to replace the traditional
classification to radio-loud, and radio-quiet or radio-silent sources with a division to jetted
and non-jetted sources.
