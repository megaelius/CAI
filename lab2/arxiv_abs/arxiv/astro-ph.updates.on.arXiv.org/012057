Fast rotation is responsible for important changes in the structure and evolution of stars. Optical
long baseline interferometry now permits the study of its effects on the stellar surface, mainly
gravity darkening and flattening. We aim to determine the fundamental parameters of the fast-rotating
star Altair, in particular its evolutionary stage, mass, and differential rotation, using state-of-the-art
stellar interior and atmosphere models together with interferometric, spectroscopic, and asteroseismic
observations. We use ESTER 2D stellar models to produce the relevant surface parameters needed
to create intensity maps from atmosphere models. Interferometric and spectroscopic observables
are computed from these intensity maps and several stellar parameters are then adjusted using the
MCMC algorithm Emcee. We determined Altair's equatorial radius to be 2.008 +/- 0.006 Rsun, the position
angle 301.1 +/- 0.3 degrees, the inclination 50.7 +/- 1.2 degrees, and the equatorial angular velocity
0.74 +/- 0.01 times the Keplerian angular velocity. This angular velocity leads to a flattening
of 0.220 +/- 0.003. We also deduce from the spectroscopically derived vsini ~ 243 km/s, a true equatorial
velocity of ~314 km/s corresponding to a rotation period of 7h46m (~3 c/d). The data also impose a
strong correlation between mass, metallicity, hydrogen abundance, and core evolution. Thanks
to asteroseismic data, we constrain the mass of Altair to 1.86 +/- 0.03 Msun and further deduce its
metallicity Z = 0.019 and its core hydrogen mass fraction Xc = 0.71, assuming an initial solar hydrogen
mass fraction X = 0.739. These values suggest that Altair is ~100 Myrs old. Finally, the 2D ESTER model
also gives the internal differential rotation of Altair, showing that its core rotates approximately
50% faster than the envelope, while the surface differential rotation does not exceed 6%.
