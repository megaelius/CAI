We study the influence of the choice of cooling function on the formation of molecular clouds in high-resolution
three-dimensional simulations of converging flows. We directly compare the results obtained
using the simple, parametrized cooling function introduced by Koyama & Inutsuka (2002) and
used by a number of converging flow studies with the results of the detailed calculation of the non-equilibrium
chemistry and thermal balance of the gas. We find that a number of the cloud properties, such as the
mass and volume filling fractions of cold gas, are relatively insensitive to the choice of cooling
function. On the other hand, the cloud morphology and the large-scale velocity distribution of
the gas do strongly depend on the cooling function. We show that the differences that we see can largely
be explained by differences in the way that Lyman-alpha cooling is treated in the two complementary
approaches, and that a proper non-equilibrium treatment of the ionisation and recombination of
the gas is necessary in order to model the high-temperature cooling correctly. We also investigate
the properties of the dense clumps formed within the cloud. In agreement with previous models, we
find that the majority of these clumps are not self-gravitating, suggesting that some form of large-scale
collapse of the cloud may be required in order to produce gravitationally unstable clumps and hence
stars. Overall, the physical properties of the dense clumps are similar in both simulations, suggesting
that they do not depend strongly on the choice of cooling function. However, we do find a systematic
difference of around 10K in the mean temperatures of the clumps produced by the two models.
