Planets similar to Earth - but slightly more irradiated - are expected to enter into a runaway greenhouse
state, where all surface water rapidly evaporates, forming an optically thick H2O-dominated atmosphere.
For Earth, this extreme climate transition is thought to occur for a ~6% increase only of the solar
luminosity, though the exact limit at which the transition would occur is still a highly debated
topic. In general, the runaway greenhouse is believed to be a fundamental process in the evolution
of Earth-size, temperate planets. Using 1-D radiative-convective climate calculations accounting
for thick, hot water vapour-dominated atmospheres, we evaluate the transit atmospheric thickness
of a post-runaway greenhouse atmosphere, and find that it could possibly reach over a thousand kilometers
(i.e., a few tens of % of Earth radius). This abrupt radius inflation - resulting from the runaway-greenhouse-induced
transition - could be detected statistically by ongoing and upcoming space missions such as TESS,
CHEOPS and PLATO (combined with precise radial velocity mass measurements with ground-based spectrographs
such as ESPRESSO, CARMENES or SPIRou), or even in particular cases in multiplanetary systems such
as TRAPPIST-1 (when masses and radii will be known with good enough precision). This result provides
the community with an observational test of (1) the concept of runaway greenhouse, that defines
the inner edge of the traditional Habitable Zone, and the exact limit of the runaway greenhouse transition.
In particular, this could provide an empirical measurement of the irradiation at which Earth analogs
transition from a temperate to a runaway greenhouse climate state. This astronomical measurement
would make it possible to statistically estimate how close Earth is from the runaway greenhouse.
(2) the presence (and statistical abundance) of water in temperate, Earth-size exoplanets.
