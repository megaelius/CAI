In recent years, space weather research has focused on developing modelling techniques to predict
the arrival time and properties of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) at the Earth. The aim of this paper
is to propose a new modelling technique suitable for the next generation of Space Weather predictive
tools that is both efficient and accurate. The aim of the new approach is to provide interplanetary
space weather forecasting models with accurate time dependent boundary conditions of erupting
magnetic flux ropes in the upper solar corona. To produce boundary conditions, we couple two different
modelling techniques, MHD simulations and a quasi-static non-potential evolution model. Both
are applied on a spatial domain that covers the entire solar surface. The non-potential model uses
a time series of observed synoptic magnetograms to drive the non-potential quasi-static evolution
of the coronal magnetic field. This allows us to follow the formation and loss of equilibrium of magnetic
flux ropes. Following this a MHD simulation captures the dynamic evolution of the erupting flux
rope. The present paper focuses on the MHD simulations that follow the ejection of magnetic flux
ropes to 4$R_\odot$. We first propose a technique for specifying the pre-eruptive plasma properties
in the corona. Next, time dependent MHD simulations describe the ejection of two magnetic flux ropes,
that produce time dependent boundary conditions for the magnetic field and plasma at 4$R_{\odot}$.
In the present paper, we show that the dual use of quasi-static non-potential magnetic field simulations
and full time dependent MHD simulations can produce realistic inhomogeneous boundary conditions
for space weather forecasting tools. Before a fully operational model can be produced there are
a number of technical and scientific challenges that still need to be addressed.
