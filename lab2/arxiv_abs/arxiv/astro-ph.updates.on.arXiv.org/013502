We present infrared luminosity functions and dust mass functions for the EAGLE cosmological simulation,
based on synthetic multi-wavelength observations generated with the SKIRT radiative transfer
code. In the local Universe, we reproduce the observed infrared luminosity and dust mass functions
very well. Some minor discrepancies are encountered, mainly in the high luminosity regime, where
the EAGLE-SKIRT luminosity functions mildly but systematically underestimate the observed ones.
The agreement between the EAGLE-SKIRT infrared luminosity functions and the observed ones gradually
worsens with increasing lookback time. Fitting modified Schechter functions to the EAGLE-SKIRT
luminosity and dust mass functions at different redshifts up to $z=1$, we find that the evolution
is compatible with pure luminosity/mass evolution. The evolution is relatively mild: within this
redshift range, we find an evolution of $L_{\star,250}\propto(1+z)^{1.68}$, $L_{\star,\text{TIR}}\propto(1+z)^{2.51}$
and $M_{\star,\text{dust}}\propto(1+z)^{0.83}$ for the characteristic luminosity/mass.
For the luminosity/mass density we find $\varepsilon_{250}\propto(1+z)^{1.62}$, $\varepsilon_{\text{TIR}}\propto(1+z)^{2.35}$
and $\rho_{\text{dust}}\propto(1+z)^{0.80}$, respectively. The mild evolution of the dust
mass density is in relatively good agreement with observations, but the slow evolution of the infrared
luminosity underestimates the observed luminosity evolution significantly. We argue that these
differences can be attributed to increasing limitations in the radiative transfer treatment due
to increasingly poorer resolution, combined with a slower than observed evolution of the SFR density
in the EAGLE simulation and the lack of AGN emission in our EAGLE-SKIRT post-processing recipe.
