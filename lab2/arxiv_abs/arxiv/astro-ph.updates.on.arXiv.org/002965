Polarized emission from aligned dust is a crucial tool for studies of magnetism in the ISM and a troublesome
contaminant for studies of CMB polarization. In each case, an understanding of the significance
of the polarization signal requires well-calibrated physical models of dust grains. Despite decades
of progress in theory and observation, polarized dust models remain largely underconstrained.
During its 2012 flight, the balloon-borne telescope BLASTPol obtained simultaneous broad-band
polarimetric maps of a translucent molecular cloud at 250, 350, and 500 microns. Combining these
data with polarimetry from the Planck 850 micron band, we have produced a submillimeter polarization
spectrum for a cloud of this type for the first time. We find the polarization degree to be largely
constant across the four bands. This result introduces a new observable with the potential to place
strong empirical constraints on ISM dust polarization models in a previously inaccessible density
regime. Comparing with models by Draine and Fraisse (2009), our result disfavors two of their models
for which all polarization arises due only to aligned silicate grains. By creating simple models
for polarized emission in a translucent cloud, we verify that extinction within the cloud should
have only a small effect on the polarization spectrum shape compared to the diffuse ISM. Thus we expect
the measured polarization spectrum to be a valid check on diffuse ISM dust models. The general flatness
of the observed polarization spectrum suggests a challenge to models where temperature and alignment
degree are strongly correlated across major dust components.
