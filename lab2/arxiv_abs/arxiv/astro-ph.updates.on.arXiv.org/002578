Precise stellar parameters are crucial for several reasons, amongst which are the precise characterization
of orbiting exoplanets and the correct determination of galactic chemical evolution. The atmospheric
parameters are extremely important because all the other stellar parameters depend on them. Using
our standard equivalent-width method on high-resolution spectroscopy, good precision can be
obtained for the derived effective temperature and metallicity. The surface gravity, however,
is usually not well constrained with spectroscopy. We use two different samples of FGK dwarfs to
study the effect of the stellar surface gravity on the precise spectroscopic determination of the
other atmospheric parameters. Furthermore, we present a straightforward formula for correcting
the spectroscopic surface gravities derived by our method and with our linelists. Our spectroscopic
analysis is based on Kurucz models in LTE, performed with the MOOG code to derive the atmospheric
parameters. The surface gravity was either left free or fixed to a predetermined value. The latter
is either obtained through a photometric transit light curve or derived using asteroseismology.
We find first that, despite some minor trends, the effective temperatures and metallicities for
FGK dwarfs derived with the described method and linelists are, in most cases, only affected within
the errorbars by using different values for the surface gravity, even for very large differences
in surface gravity, so they can be trusted. The temperatures derived with a fixed surface gravity
continue to be compatible within 1 sigma with the accurate results of the InfraRed Flux Method (IRFM),
as is the case for the unconstrained temperatures. Secondly, we find that the spectroscopic surface
gravity can easily be corrected to a more accurate value using a linear function with the effective
temperature.
