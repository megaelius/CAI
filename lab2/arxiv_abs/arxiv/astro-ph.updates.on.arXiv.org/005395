The combined observation of gravitational and electromagnetic waves from the coalescence of two
neutron stars marks the beginning of multi-messenger astronomy with gravitational waves (GWs).
The development of accurate gravitational waveform models is a crucial prerequisite to extract
information about the properties of the binary system that generated a detected GW signal. In binary
neutron star systems (BNS), tidal effects also need to be incorporated in the modeling for an accurate
waveform representation. Building on previous work [Phys.Rev.D96 121501], we explore the performance
of inspiral-merger waveform models that are obtained by adding a numerical relativity (NR) based
approximant for the tidal part of the phasing (NRTidal) to existing models for nonprecessing and
precessing binary black hole systems (SEOBNRv4, PhenomD and PhenomPv2), as implemented in the
LSC Algorithm Library Suite. The resulting BNS waveforms are compared and contrasted to target
waveforms hybridizing NR waveforms, covering the last approx. 10 orbits up to merger and extending
through the postmerger phase, with inspiral waveforms calculated from 30Hz obtained with TEOBResumS.
The latter is a state-of-the-art effective-one-body waveform model that blends together tidal
and spin effects. We probe that the combination of the PN-based self-spin terms and of the NRTidal
description is necessary to obtain minimal mismatches (< 0.01) and phase differences (< 1 rad) with
respect to the target waveforms. However, we also discuss possible improvements and drawbacks
of the NRTidal approximant in its current form, since we find that it tends to overestimate the tidal
interaction with respect to the TEOBResumS model during the inspiral.
