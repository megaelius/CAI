We examine the impact of baryon-dark matter relative velocities on intergalactic small-scale
structure and the 21 cm signal during reionization. Streaming velocities reduced clumping in the
intergalactic medium (IGM) on mass scales of $\sim 10^4 - 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$. This effect produced
a distinct baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the 21 cm power spectrum at wave numbers
$k\sim 0.1$ h/Mpc, near which forthcoming surveys will be most sensitive. In contrast to the highly
uncertain impact of streaming velocities on star formation, the effect on clumping is better constrained
because it is set mainly by cosmology and straightforward gas dynamics. We quantify the latter using
coupled radiation-hydrodynamic simulations that capture the Jeans scale of pre-reionization
gas. The clumping factor of ionized gas is reduced by 5-10\% in regions with RMS streaming velocities.
The suppression peaks $\approx 5$ Myr after a region is reionized, but disappears within 200 Myr
due to pressure smoothing. We model the corresponding impact on the 21 cm signal and find that the
BAO feature is most likely to appear at $\approx$ 10 \% ionization. During this phase, the feature
may appear at the 1 \% (5 \%) level at $k \sim 0.1 (0.06)$ h/Mpc with an amplitude that varies by a factor
of $< 10$ across a range of reionization histories. We also provide a model for the signal originating
from streaming velocity's impact on ionizing sources, which can vary by 4 orders of magnitude depending
on highly uncertain source properties. We find that the clumping signal probably dominates the
source one unless Population III star formation in $10^6 - 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$ halos contributed
significantly to the first 10\% of reionization.
