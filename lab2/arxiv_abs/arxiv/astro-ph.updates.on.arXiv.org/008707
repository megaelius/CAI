MHD simulations show that the magnetic field can drive molecular outflows during the formation
of massive protostars. The best probe to observationally measure both the morphology and the strength
of this magnetic field at scales of 10-100 au is maser polarization. We measure the direction of magnetic
fields at mas resolution around a sample of massive star-forming regions to determine whether there
is a relation between the orientation of the magnetic field and of the outflows. In addition, by estimating
the magnetic field strength via the Zeeman splitting measurements, the role of magnetic field in
the dynamics of the massive star-forming region is investigated. We selected a flux-limited sample
of 31 massive star-forming regions to perform a statistical analysis of the magnetic field properties
with respect to the molecular outflows characteristics. We report the linearly and circularly
polarized emission of 6.7 GHz CH3OH masers towards seven massive star-forming regions of the total
sample with the EVN. The sources are: G23.44-0.18, G25.83-0.18, G25.71-0.04, G28.31-0.39, G28.83-0.25,
G29.96-0.02, and G43.80-0.13. We identified a total of 219 CH3OH maser features, 47 and 2 of which
showed linearly and circularly polarized emission, respectively. We measured well-ordered linear
polarization vectors around all the massive YSOs and Zeeman splitting towards G25.71-0.04 and
G28.83-0.25. Thanks to recent theoretical results, we were able to provide lower limits to the magnetic
field strength from our Zeeman splitting measurements. We further confirm (based on ~80% of the
total flux-limited sample) that the magnetic field on scales of 10-100 au is preferentially oriented
along the outflow axes. The estimated magnetic field strength of |B_{||}|>61 mG and >21 mG towards
G25.71-0.04 and G28.83-0.2, respectively, indicates that it dominates the dynamics of the gas
in both regions.
