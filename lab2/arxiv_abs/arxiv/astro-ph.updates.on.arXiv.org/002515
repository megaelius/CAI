Strongly gravitationally lensed quasar-galaxy systems allow us to compare competing cosmologies
as long as one can be reasonably sure of the mass distribution within the intervening lens. In this
paper, we assemble a catalog of 69 such systems, and carry out a one-on-one comparison between the
standard model, LCDM, and the R_h=ct Universe. We find that both models account for the lens observations
quite well, though the precision of these measurements does not appear to be good enough to favor
one model over the other. Part of the reason is the so-called bulge-halo conspiracy that, on average,
results in a baryonic velocity dispersion within a fraction of the optical effective radius virtually
identical to that expected for the whole luminous-dark matter distribution. Given the limitations
of doing precision cosmological testing using the current sample, we also carry out Monte Carlo
simulations based on the current lens measurements to estimate how large the source catalog would
have to be in order to rule out either model at a ~99.7% confidence level. We find that if the real cosmology
is LCDM, a sample of ~200 strong gravitational lenses would be sufficient to rule out R_h=ct at this
level of accuracy, while ~300 strong gravitational lenses would be required to rule out LCDM if the
real Universe were instead R_h=ct. The difference in required sample size reflects the greater
number of free parameters available to fit the data with LCDM. We point out that, should the R_h=ct
Universe eventually emerge as the correct cosmology, its lack of any free parameters for this kind
of work will provide a remarkably powerful probe of the mass structure in lensing galaxies, and a
means of better understanding the origin of the bulge-halo conspiracy.
