We report evidence of environmental quenching among galaxies at redshift ~ 2, namely the probability
that a galaxy quenches its star formation activity is enhanced in the regions of space in proximity
of other quenched, more massive galaxies. The effect is observed as strong clustering of quiescent
galaxies around quiescent galaxies on angular scales \theta < 20 arcsec, corresponding to a proper(comoving)
scale of 168 (502) kpc at z = 2. The effect is observed only for quiescent galaxies around other quiescent
galaxies; the probability to find star-forming galaxies around quiescent or around star-forming
ones is consistent with the clustering strength of galaxies of the same mass and at the same redshift,
as observed in dedicated studies of galaxy clustering. The effect is mass dependent in the sense
that the quenching probability is stronger for galaxies of smaller mass ($\rm{M_*<10^{10} Msun}$)
than for more massive ones, i.e. it follows the opposite trend with mass relative to gravitational
galaxy clustering. The spatial scale where the effect is observed suggests these environments
are massive halos, in which case the observed effect would likely be satellite quenching. The effect
is also redshift dependent in that the clustering strength of quiescent galaxies around other quiescent
galaxies at z = 1.6 is ~ 1.7 times larger than that of the galaxies with the same stellar mass at z = 2.6.
This redshift dependence allows for a crude estimate of the time scale of environmental quenching
of low-mass galaxies, which is in the range 1.5 - 4 Gyr, in broad agreement with other estimates and
with our ideas on satellite quenching.
