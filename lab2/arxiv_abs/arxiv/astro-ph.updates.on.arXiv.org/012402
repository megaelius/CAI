We report Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations of 3 mm dust continuum emission and line emission,
in HCO$^{+}$, H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$, N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ and CH$_{3}$CN, towards two massive and dense
clumps (MDCs) in early but distinct evolutionary phases (prestellar and protostellar), made with
the goal of investigating their fragmentation characteristics at angular scales of $\sim$1 $\arcsec$.
Towards the prestellar clump we detected ten compact structures (cores), with radius from 1200
to 4500 AU and masses from 1.6 to 20~M$_\odot$. Half of these cores exhibit inverse P Cygni profiles
in HCO$^{+}$ and are subvirialized indicating that they are undergoing collapse. Towards the protostellar
clump we detected a massive (119~M$_\odot$) central core, with a strong mass infall rate, and nine
less massive cores, with masses from 1.7 to 27~M$_\odot$ and radius from 1000 to 4300 AU. CH$_{3}$CN
rotational temperatures were derived for 8 cores in the protostellar clump and 3 cores in the prestellar
clump. Cores within the prestellar clump have smaller linewidths and lower temperatures than cores
within the protostellar clump. The fraction of total mass in cores to clump mass is smaller in the
prestellar clump ($\sim$6\%) than in the protostellar clump ($\sim$23\%). We conclude that we
are witnessing the evolution of the dense gas in globally collapsing MDCs; the prestellar clump
illustrating the initial stage of fragmentation, harboring cores that are individually collapsing,
and the protostellar clump reflecting a later stage in which a considerable fraction of the gas has
been gravitationally focused into the central region.
