Interpreting the small-scale clustering of galaxies with halo models can elucidate the connection
between galaxies and dark matter halos. Unfortunately, the modelling is typically not sufficiently
accurate for ruling out models in a statistical sense. It is thus difficult to use the information
encoded in small scales to test cosmological models or probe subtle features of the galaxy-halo
connection. In this paper, we attempt to push halo modelling into the "accurate" regime with a fully
numerical mock-based methodology and careful treatment of statistical and systematic errors.
An advantage of this approach is that it can easily incorporate clustering statistics beyond the
traditional two-point statistics. We use this modelling methodology to test the standard $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$
+ halo model against the clustering of SDSS DR7 galaxies. Specifically, we use the projected correlation
function, group multiplicity function and galaxy number density as constraints. We find that while
the model provides a good match to each statistic separately, it struggles to fit them jointly. Adding
group statistics leads to a more stringent test of the model and significantly tighter constraints
on model parameters. We explore the impact of varying the adopted halo definition and cosmological
model and find that changing the cosmology makes a significant difference. The most successful
model we tried (Planck cosmology with Mvir halos) matches the clustering of low luminosity galaxies,
but exhibits a $2.3 \sigma$ tension with the clustering of luminous galaxies, thus providing evidence
that the "standard" halo model needs to be extended. This work represents the most accurate modelling
of small-scale clustering to-date and opens the door to adding interesting freedom to the halo model
and including additional clustering statistics as constraints.
