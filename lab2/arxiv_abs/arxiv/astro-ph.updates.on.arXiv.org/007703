Encounters between galaxies modify their morphology, kinematics, and star formation (SF) history.
The relation between these changes and external perturbations is not straightforward. The great
number of parameters involved requires both the study of large samples and individual encounters
where particular features, motions, and perturbations can be traced and analysed in detail. We
analysed the morphology, kinematics, and dynamics of two luminous infrared spiral galaxies, NGC
5257 and NGC 5258, in which SF is mostly confined to the spiral arms, in order to understand interactions
between galaxies of equivalent masses and SF processes during the encounter. Using scanning Fabry-Perot
interferometry, we studied the contribution of circular and non-circular motions and the response
of the ionized gas to external perturbations. We compared the kinematics with direct images of the
pair and traced the SF processes and gravitational effects due to the presence of the other galaxy.
The SED of each member of the pair was fitted. A mass model was fitted to the rotation curve of each galaxy.
Large, non-circular motions detected in both galaxies are associated with a bar, spiral arms, and
HII regions for the inner parts of the galaxies, and with the tidal interaction for the outer parts
of the discs. Bifurcations in the rotation curves indicate that the galaxies have recently undergone
their pericentric passage. The pattern speed of a perturbation of one of the galaxies is computed.
Location of a possible corotation seems to indicate that the gravitational response of the ionized
gas in the outer parts of the disc is related to the regions where ongoing SF is confined. The SED fit
indicates a slightly different star formation history for each member of the pair. For both galaxies,
a pseudo-isothermal halo better fits the global mass distribution.
