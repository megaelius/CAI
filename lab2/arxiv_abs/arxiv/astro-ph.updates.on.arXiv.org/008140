Recent observations of protoplanetary disks, as well as simulations of planet-disk interaction,
have suggested that a single planet may excite multiple spiral arms in the disk, in contrast to the
previous expectations based on linear theory (predicting a one-armed density wave). We re-assess
the origin of multiple arms in the framework of linear theory, by solving for the global two-dimensional
response of a non-barotropic disk to an orbiting planet. We show that the formation of a secondary
arm in the inner disk, at about half of the orbital radius of the planet, is a robust prediction of linear
theory. This arm becomes stronger than the primary spiral at several tenths of the orbital radius
of the planet. Several additional, weaker spiral arms may also form in the inner disk. On the contrary,
a secondary spiral arm is unlikely to form in the outer disk. Our linear calculations, fully accounting
for the global behavior of both the phases and amplitudes of perturbations, generally support the
recently proposed WKB phase argument for the secondary arm origin (as caused by the intricacy of
constructive interference of azimuthal harmonics of the perturbation at different radii). We
provide analytical arguments showing that the process of a single spiral wake splitting up into
multiple arms is a generic linear outcome of wave propagation in differentially rotating disks.
It is not unique to planet-driven waves and occurs also in linear calculations of spiral wakes freely
propagating with no external torques. These results are relevant for understanding formation
of multiple rings and gaps in protoplanetary disks.
