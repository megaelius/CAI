Determining the expansion of the universe, i.e. the Hubble constant (H0) to better than 2% is required
in order to understand the nature of dark energy. However, the two most accurate methods to do it,
the cosmic microwave background and the distance scale ladder are inconsistent today, which is
refereed as the "tension". One of the key to resolve this tension is related to the calibration of
the period-luminosity (PL) of Cepheids : what is its zero-point ? Is it metallicity dependent ? Can
we reduce the dispersion of the PL relation ? The eclipsing binaries method was recently used to determine
the distance to LMC with a 2.2% accuracy, which is crucial to constrain the zero-point of the PL relation
and to study the impact of metallicity. However, this method is based on the hypothesis that stars
are perfect blackbody, which is not always the case as shown by inconsistencies in the surface brightness
- color relations of early type stars for instance, that are actually useful for the distance determination
of eclipsing binaries in distant galaxies (i.e. M31, M33). On the other hand, it is now possible to
apply the Baade-Wesselink method to Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds, however the value of the
projection factor and its dependence with the period of Cepheids remains a key issue. Understanding
the dynamical structure of the atmosphere of Cepheids (p-factor, k-factor) and their environment
cannot be circumvented in order to determine the distance in the universe. This is even more true
that the environment of Cepheids could increase the dispersion of the PL relation. The next generation
of interferometers (MATISSE, SPICA), the Gaia parallaxes, in the context of JWST, PLATO, and ELT
will help to resolve these fundamental issues.
