We compare the results for a set of hydrodynamical tests performed with the AMR finite volume code,
MG and the SPH code, SEREN. The test suite includes shock tube tests, with and without cooling, the
non-linear thin-shell instability and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The main conclusions
are : (i) the two methods converge in the limit of high resolution and accuracy in most cases. All tests
show good agreement when numerical effects (e.g. discontinuities in SPH) are properly treated.
(ii) Both methods can capture adiabatic shocks and well-resolved cooling shocks perfectly well
with standard prescriptions. However, they both have problems when dealing with under-resolved
cooling shocks, or strictly isothermal shocks, at high Mach numbers. The finite volume code only
works well at 1st order and even then requires some additional artificial viscosity. SPH requires
either a larger value of the artificial viscosity parameter, alpha_AV, or a modified form of the
standard artificial viscosity term using the harmonic mean of the density, rather than the arithmetic
mean. (iii) Some SPH simulations require larger kernels to increase neighbour number and reduce
particle noise in order to achieve agreement with finite volume simulations. However, this is partly
due to the need to reduce noise that can corrupt the growth of small-scale perturbations. In contrast,
instabilities seeded from large-scale perturbations do not require more neighbours and hence
work well with standard SPH formulations and converge with the finite volume simulations. (iv)
For purely hydrodynamical problems, SPH simulations take an order of magnitude longer to run than
finite volume simulations when running at equivalent resolutions, i.e. when they both resolve
the underlying physics to the same degree. This requires about 2-3 times as many particles as the
number of cells.
