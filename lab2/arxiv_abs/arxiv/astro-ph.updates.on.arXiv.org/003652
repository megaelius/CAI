We present a measurement of galaxy-galaxy lensing around a magnitude-limited ($i_{AB} < 22.5$)
sample of galaxies from the Dark Energy Survey Science Verification (DES-SV) data. We split these
lenses into three photometric-redshift bins from 0.2 to 0.8, and determine the product of the galaxy
bias $b$ and cross-correlation coefficient between the galaxy and dark matter overdensity fields
$r$ in each bin, using scales above 4 Mpc/$h$ comoving, where we find the linear bias model to be valid
given our current uncertainties. We compare our galaxy bias results from galaxy-galaxy lensing
with those obtained from galaxy clustering (Crocce et al. 2016) and CMB lensing (Giannantonio et
al. 2016) for the same sample of galaxies, and find our measurements to be in good agreement with those
in Crocce et al. (2016), while, in the lowest redshift bin ($z\sim0.3$), they show some tension with
the findings in Giannantonio et al. (2016). We measure $b\cdot r$ to be $0.87\pm 0.11$, $1.12 \pm
0.16$ and $1.24\pm 0.23$, respectively for the three redshift bins of width $\Delta z = 0.2$ in the
range $0.2<z <0.8$, defined with the photometric-redshift algorithm BPZ. Using a different code
to split the lens sample, TPZ, leads to changes in the measured biases at the 10-20\% level, but it
does not alter the main conclusion of this work: when comparing with Crocce et al. (2016) we do not
find strong evidence for a cross-correlation parameter significantly below one in this galaxy
sample, except possibly at the lowest redshift bin ($z\sim 0.3$), where we find $r = 0.71 \pm 0.11$
when using TPZ, and $0.83 \pm 0.12$ with BPZ.
