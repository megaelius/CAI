We investigate the evolution of both normal and inverse CMEs ejected at different initial velocities,
and observe the effect of the background wind density and their magnetic polarity on their evolution
up to 1 AU. We performed 2.5D simulations by solving the magnetohydrodynamic equations on a radially
stretched grid, employing a block-based adaptive mesh refinement scheme based on a density threshold
to achieve high resolution following the evolution of the magnetic clouds and the leading bow shocks.
All the simulations discussed in the present paper were performed using the same initial grid and
numerical methods. The polarity of the internal magnetic field of the CME has a substantial effect
on its propagation velocity and on its deformation and erosion during its evolution towards Earth.
We quantified the effects of the polarity of the internal magnetic field of the CMEs and of the density
of the background solar wind on the arrival times of the shock front and the magnetic cloud. We determined
the positions and propagation velocities of the magnetic clouds and thus also the stand-off distance
of the leading shock fronts (i.e. the thickness of the magnetic sheath region) and the deformation
and erosion of the magnetic clouds during their evolution from the Sun to the Earth. Inverse CMEs
were found to be faster than normal CMEs ejected in the same initial conditions, but with smaller
stand-off distances. They also have a higher magnetic cloud length, opening angle, and mass. Synthetic
satellite time series showed that the shock magnitude is not affected by the polarity of the CME.
However, the density peak of the magnetic cloud is dependent on the polarity and, in case of inverse
CMEs, also on the background wind density. The magnitude of the z-component of the magnetic field
was not influenced by either the polarity or the wind density.
