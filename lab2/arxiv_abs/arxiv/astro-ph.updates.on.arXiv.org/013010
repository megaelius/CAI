We report the scaling relations derived by fitting the X-ray parameters determined from analyzing
the XMM-Newton observations of 120 galaxy clusters in the Planck Early Sunyaev-Zel'dovich sample
spanning the redshift range of 0.059$<$$z$$<$0.546. We find that the slopes of all the investigated
scaling relations significantly deviate from the self-similar predictions, if self-similar
redshift evolution is assumed. When the redshift evolution is left free to vary, the derived slopes
are more in agreement with the self-similar predictions. Relaxed clusters have on average $\sim$30$\%$
higher X-ray luminosity than disturbed clusters at a given mass, a difference that, depending on
the relative fraction of relaxed and disturbed clusters in the samples (e.g. SZ vs X-ray selected),
have a strong impact in the normalization obtained in different studies. Using the core-excised
cluster luminosities reduces the scatter and brings into better agreement the $L$-$M_{tot}$ and
$L$-$T$ relations determined for different samples. $M_{tot}$-$T$, $M_{tot}$-$Y_X$, and $M_{tot}$-$M_{gas}$
relations show little dependence on the dynamical state of the clusters, but the normalizations
of these relations may depend on the mass range investigated. Although most of the clusters investigated
in this work reside at relatively low redshift, the fits prefer values of $\gamma$, the parameter
accounting for the redshift evolution, different from the self-similar predictions. This suggests
an evolution ($<$2$\sigma$ level, with the exception of the $M_{tot}$-$T$ relation) of the scaling
relations. For the first time, we find significant evolution ($>$3$\sigma$) of the $M_{tot}$-$T$
relation, pointing to an increase of the kinetic-to-thermal energy ratio with redshift. This is
consistent with a scenario in which higher redshift clusters are on average more disturbed than
their lower redshift counterparts.
