Hyper-luminous X-ray sources (HLXs; L_X>10^41 erg s^-1) are off-nuclear X-ray sources in galaxies
and strong candidates for intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We have constructed a sample
of 169 HLX candidates by combining X-ray detections from the Chandra Source Catalog (Version 2)
with galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and registering individual images for improved
relative astrometric accuracy. The spatial resolution of Chandra allows for the sample to extend
out to z~0.9. Optical counterparts are detected among one-fourth of the sample, one-third of which
are consistent with dwarf galaxy stellar masses. The average intrinsic X-ray spectral slope indicates
efficient accretion, potentially driven by galaxy mergers, and the column densities suggest one-third
of the sample has significant X-ray absorption. We find that 144 of the HLX candidates have X-ray
emission that is significantly in excess of the expected contribution from star formation and hot
gas, strongly suggesting that they are produced by accretion onto black holes more massive than
stars. After correcting for an average background or foreground contamination rate of 8%, we estimate
that at least ~20 of the HLX candidates are consistent with IMBH masses, and this estimate is potentially
several times higher assuming more efficient accretion. This catalog currently represents the
largest sample of uniformly-selected, off-nuclear IMBH candidates. These sources may represent
scenarios in which a low-mass galaxy hosting an IMBH has merged with a more massive galaxy and provide
an excellent sample for testing models of low-mass BH formation and merger-driven growth.
