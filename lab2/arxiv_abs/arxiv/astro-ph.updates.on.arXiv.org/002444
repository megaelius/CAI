The observed deficit of strongly Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies at z>6.5 is attributed to either
increasing neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and/or to the evolving galaxy properties.
To investigate this, we have performed very deep near-IR spectroscopy of z>7 galaxies using
MOSFIRE on the Keck-I Telescope. We measure the Lyman-alpha fraction at z~8 (combined photometric
redshift peak at z=7.7) using two methods. First, we derived NLy{\alpha}/Ntot directly using extensive
simulations to correct for incompleteness. Second, we used a Bayesian formalism (introduced by
Treu et al. 2012) that compares the z>7 galaxy spectra to models of the Lyman-alpha equivalent
width (WLy{\alpha}) distribution at z~6. We explored two simple evolutionary scenarios: smooth
evolution where Lyman-alpha is attenuated in all galaxies by a constant factor (perhaps owing to
processes from galaxy evolution or a slowly increasing IGM opacity), and patchy evolution where
Lyman-alpha is blocked in some fraction of galaxies (perhaps due to the IGM being opaque along only
some fraction of sightlines). The Bayesian formalism places stronger constraints compared with
the direct method. Combining our data with that in the literature we find that at z~8 the Lyman-alpha
fraction has dropped by a factor >3(84% confidence interval) using both the smooth and patchy
scenarios compared to the z~6 values. Furthermore, we find a tentative evidence that the data favor
the patchy scenario over smooth (with "positive" Bayesian evidence), extending trends observed
at z~7 to higher redshift. If this decrease is a result of reionization as predicted by theory, then
our data imply the volume averaged neutral hydrogen fraction in the IGM to be >0.3 suggesting
that the reionization of the universe is in progress at z~8.
