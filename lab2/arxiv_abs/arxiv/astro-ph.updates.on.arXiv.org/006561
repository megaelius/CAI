We present a "super-deblended" far-infrared to (sub)millimeter photometric catalog in the Cosmic
Evolution Survey (COSMOS), prepared with the method recently developed by Liu et al. 2018, with
key adaptations. We obtain point spread function (PSF) fitting photometry at fixed prior positions
including 88,008 galaxies detected in either VLA 1.4~GHz, 3~GHz and/or MIPS 24~$\mu$m images.
By adding a specifically carved mass-selected sample (with an evolving stellar mass limit), a highly
complete prior sample of 194,428 galaxies is achieved for deblending FIR/(sub)mm images. We performed
``active' removal of non relevant priors at FIR/(sub)mm bands using spectral energy distribution
(SED) fitting and redshift information. In order to cope with the shallower COSMOS data we subtract
from the maps the flux of faint non-fitted priors and explicitly account for the uncertainty of this
step. The resulting photometry (including data from Spitzer, Herschel, SCUBA2, AzTEC, MAMBO and
NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 3~GHz and 1.4~GHz) displays well behaved quasi-Gaussian
uncertainties, calibrated from Monte Carlo simulations and tailored to observables (crowding,
residual maps). Comparison to ALMA photometry for hundreds of sources provide a remarkable validation
of the technique. We detect 11,220 galaxies over the 100--1200~$\mu$m range, extending to $z_{\rm
phot}\sim7$. We conservatively selected a sample of 85 $z>4$ high redshift candidates, significantly
detected in the FIR/(sub)mm, often with secure radio and/or Spitzer/IRAC counterparts. This provides
a chance to investigate the first generation of vigorous starburst galaxies (SFRs$\sim1000\mathrm{M}_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$).
The photometric and value added catalogs are publicly released.
