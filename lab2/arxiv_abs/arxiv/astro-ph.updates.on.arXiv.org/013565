We study the optical light curves - primarily probing the variable emission from the accretion disk
- of ~ 900 extreme variability quasars (EVQs, with maximum flux variations more than 1 mag) over an
observed-frame baseline of ~ 16 years using public data from the SDSS Stripe 82, PanSTARRS-1 and
the Dark Energy Survey. We classify the multi-year long-term light curves of EVQs into three categories
roughly in the order of decreasing smoothness: monotonic decreasing or increasing (3.7%), single
broad peak and dip (56.8%), and more complex patterns (39.5%). The rareness of monotonic cases suggests
that the major mechanisms driving the extreme optical variability do not operate over timescales
much longer than a few years. Simulated light curves with a damped random walk model generally under-predict
the first two categories with smoother long-term trends. Despite the different long-term behaviors
of these EVQs, there is little dependence of the long-term trend on the physical properties of quasars,
such as their luminosity, BH mass, and Eddington ratio. The large dynamic range of optical flux variability
over multi-year timescales of these EVQs allows us to explore the ensemble correlation between
the short-term (< 6 months) variability and the seasonal-average flux across the decade-long baseline
(the rms-mean flux relation). We find that unlike the results for X-ray variability studies, the
linear short-term flux variations do not scale with the seasonal-average flux, indicating different
mechanisms that drive the short-term flickering and long-term extreme variability of accretion
disk emission. Finally, we present a sample of 16 EVQs, where the approximately bell-shaped large
amplitude variation in the light curve can be reasonably well fit by a simple microlensing model.
