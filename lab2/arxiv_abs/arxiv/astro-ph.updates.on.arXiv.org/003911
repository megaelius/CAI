With a large, unique spectroscopic survey in the fields of 28 galaxy-scale strong gravitational
lenses, we identify groups of galaxies in the 26 adequately-sampled fields. Using a group finding
algorithm, we find 210 groups with at least five member galaxies; the median number of members is
eight. Our sample spans redshifts of 0.04 $\le z_{grp} \le$ 0.76 with a median of 0.31, including
174 groups with $0.1 < z_{grp} < 0.6$. Groups have radial velocity dispersions of 60 $\le \sigma_{grp}
\le$ 1200 km s$^{-1}$ with a median of 350 km s$^{-1}$. We also discover a supergroup in field B0712+472
at $z =$ 0.29 consisting of three main groups. We recover groups similar to $\sim$ 85% of those previously
reported in these fields within our redshift range of sensitivity and find 187 new groups with at
least five members. The properties of our group catalog, specifically 1) the distribution of $\sigma_{grp}$,
2) the fraction of all sample galaxies that are group members, and 3) the fraction of groups with significant
substructure, are consistent with those for other catalogs. The distribution of group virial masses
agrees well with theoretical expectations. Of the lens galaxies, 12 of 26 (46%) (B1422+231, B1600+434,
B2114+022, FBQS J0951+2635, HE0435-1223, HST J14113+5211, MG0751+2716, MGJ1654+1346, PG 1115+080,
Q ER 0047-2808, RXJ1131-1231, and WFI J2033-4723) are members of groups with at least five galaxies,
and one more (B0712+472) belongs to an additional, visually identified group candidate. There
are groups not associated with the lens that still are likely to affect the lens model; in six of 25
(24%) fields (excluding the supergroup), there is at least one massive ($\sigma_{grp} \ge$ 500
km s$^{-1}$) group or group candidate projected within 2$^{\prime}$ of the lens.
