With upcoming all sky surveys such as LSST poised to generate a deep digital movie of the optical sky,
variability-based AGN selection will enable the construction of highly-complete catalogs with
minimum contamination. In this study, we generate $g$-band difference images and construct light
curves for QSO/AGN candidates listed in SDSS Stripe 82 public catalogs compiled from different
methods, including spectroscopy, optical colors, variability, and X-ray detection. Image differencing
excels at identifying variable sources embedded in complex or blended emission regions such as
Type II AGNs and other low-luminosity AGNs that may be omitted from traditional photometric or spectroscopic
catalogs. To separate QSOs/AGNs from other sources using our difference image light curves, we
explore several light curve statistics and parameterize optical variability by the characteristic
damping timescale ($\tau$) and variability amplitude. By virtue of distinguishable variability
parameters of AGNs, we are able to select them with high completeness of 93.4% and efficiency (i.e.,
purity) of 71.3%. Based on optical variability, we also select highly variable blazar candidates,
whose infrared colors are consistent with known blazars. One third of them are also radio detected.
With the X-ray selected AGN candidates, we probe the optical variability of X-ray detected optically-extended
sources using their difference image light curves for the first time. A combination of optical variability
and X-ray detection enables us to select various types of host-dominated AGNs. Contrary to the AGN
unification model prediction, two Type II AGN candidates (out of 6) show detectable variability
on long-term timescales like typical Type I AGNs. This study will provide a baseline for future optical
variability studies of extended sources.
