The mass evolution of protoplanetary disks is driven by both internal processes and external factors,
such as photoevaporation. Disentangling these two effects, however, has remained difficult.
We measure the dust masses of a sample of 132 disks in the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC)-2 region, and
compare them to (i) externally photoevaporated disks in the Trapezium cluster, and (ii) disks in
nearby low-mass star forming regions (SFRs). This allows us to test if initial disk properties are
the same in high- and low-mass SFRs, and enables a direct measurement of the effect of external photoevaporation
on disks. A ~ $20' \times 4'$ mosaic of 3 mm continuum observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) was used to measure the fluxes of 132 disks and 35 protostars >0.5 pc away from the Trapezium.
We identify and characterize a sample of 34 point sources not included in the Spitzer catalog on which
the sample is based. Of the disks, 37 (28%) are detected, with masses ranging from 7-270 M_e. The detection
rate for protostars is higher at 69%. Disks near the Trapezium are found to be less massive by a factor
$0.18^{+0.18}_{-0.11}$, implying a mass loss rate of $8\times10^{-8}$ M_sun/yr. Our observations
allow us to distinguish the impact of time and environment on disk evolution in a single SFR. The disk
mass distribution in OMC-2 is statistically indistinguishable from that in nearby low-mass SFRs,
like Lupus and Taurus. We conclude that age is the main factor determining the evolution of these
disks. This result is robust with respect to assumptions of dust temperature, sample incompleteness
and biases. The difference between the OMC-2 and Trapezium cluster samples is consistent with mass
loss driven by far-ultraviolet radiation near the Trapezium. Together, this implies that in isolation,
disk formation and evolution proceed similarly, regardless of cloud mass.
