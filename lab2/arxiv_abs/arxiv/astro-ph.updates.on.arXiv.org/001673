Observations from optical to centimeter wavelengths have demonstrated that multiple systems
of two or more bodies is the norm at all stellar evolutionary stages. Multiple systems are widely
agreed to result from the collapse and fragmentation of cloud cores, despite the inhibiting influence
of magnetic fields. Surveys of Class 0 protostars with mm interferometers have revealed a very high
multiplicity frequency of about 2/3, even though there are observational difficulties in resolving
close protobinaries, thus supporting the possibility that all stars could be born in multiple systems.
Near-infrared adaptive optics observations of Class I protostars show a lower binary frequency
relative to the Class 0 phase, a declining trend that continues through the Class II/III stages to
the field population. This loss of companions is a natural consequence of dynamical interplay in
small multiple systems, leading to ejection of members. We discuss observational consequences
of this dynamical evolution, and its influence on circumstellar disks, and we review the evolution
of circumbinary disks and their role in defining binary mass ratios. Special attention is paid to
eclipsing PMS binaries, which allow for observational tests of evolutionary models of early stellar
evolution. Many stars are born in clusters and small groups, and we discuss how interactions in dense
stellar environments can significantly alter the distribution of binary separations through
dissolution of wider binaries. The binaries and multiples we find in the field are the survivors
of these internal and external destructive processes, and we provide a detailed overview of the
multiplicity statistics of the field, which form a boundary condition for all models of binary evolution.
Finally we discuss various formation mechanisms for massive binaries, and the properties of massive
trapezia.
