Aims: MASCARA and bRing are photometric surveys designed to detect variability caused by exoplanets
in stars with $m_V < 8.4$. Such variability signals are typically small and require an accurate calibration
algorithm, tailored to the survey, in order to be detected. This paper presents the methods developed
to calibrate the raw photometry of the MASCARA and bRing stations and characterizes the performance
of the methods and instruments. Methods: For the primary calibration a modified version of the coarse
decorrelation algorithm is used, which corrects for the extinction due to the earth's atmosphere,
the camera transmission, and intrapixel variations. Residual trends are removed from the light
curves of individual stars using empirical secondary calibration methods. In order to optimize
these methods, as well as characterize the performance of the instruments, transit signals were
injected in the data. Results: After optimal calibration an RMS scatter of 10 mmag at $m_V \sim 7.5$
is achieved in the light curves. By injecting transit signals with periods between one and five days
in the MASCARA data obtained by the La Palma station over the course of one year, we demonstrate that
MASCARA La Palma is able to recover 84.0, 60.5 and 20.7% of signals with depths of 2, 1 and 0.5% respectively,
with a strong dependency on the observed declination, recovering 65.4% of all transit signals at
$\delta > 0^\circ$ versus 35.8% at $\delta < 0^\circ$. Using the full three years of data obtained
by MASCARA La Palma to date, similar recovery rates are extended to periods up to ten days. We derive
a preliminary occurrence rate for hot Jupiters around A-stars of ${>} 0.4 \%$, knowing that many
hot Jupiters are still overlooked. In the era of TESS, MASCARA and bRing will provide an interesting
synergy for finding long-period (${>} 13.5$ days) transiting gas-giant planets around the brightest
stars.
