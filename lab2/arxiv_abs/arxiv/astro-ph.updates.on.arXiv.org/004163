We analyze scaling relations and evolution histories of galaxy sizes in TNG100, part of the IllustrisTNG
simulation suite. Observational qualitative trends of size with stellar mass, star-formation
rate and redshift are reproduced, and a quantitative comparison of projected r-band sizes at 0~<z<~2
shows agreement to much better than 0.25dex. We follow populations of z=0 galaxies with a range of
masses backwards in time along their main progenitor branches, distinguishing between main-sequence
and quenched galaxies. Our main findings are as follows. (i) At M_{*,z=0}>~10^{9.5}Msun, the evolution
of the median main progenitor differs, with quenched galaxies hardly growing in median size before
quenching, whereas main-sequence galaxies grow their median size continuously, thus opening
a gap from the progenitors of quenched galaxies. This is partly because the main-sequence high-redshift
progenitors of quenched z=0 galaxies are drawn from the lower end of the size distribution of the
overall population of main-sequence high-redshift galaxies. (ii) Quenched galaxies with M_{*,z=0}>~10^{9.5}Msun
experience a steep size growth on the size-mass plane after their quenching time, but with the exception
of galaxies with M_{*,z=0}>~10^{11}Msun, the size growth after quenching is small in absolute
terms, such that most of the size (and mass) growth of quenched galaxies (and its variation among
them) occurs while they are still on the main-sequence. After they become quenched, the size growth
rate of quenched galaxies as a function of time, as opposed to versus mass, is similar to that of main-sequence
galaxies. Hence, the size gap is retained down to z=0.
