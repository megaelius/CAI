Using HST/STIS G140M spectroscopy, we investigate an absorption line system at $z$=0.07489 in
the spectrum of QSO PG1543+489 ($z_{QSO}$=0.401). The sightline passes within $\rho$ = 66 kpc of
an edge-on $2L^*$ disk galaxy at a similar redshift, but the galaxy belongs to a group with 4 other
galaxies within $\rho =160$ kpc. We detect [log $N$(H I/$cm^{-2}$) = 19.12$\pm$0.04] as well as
N I, Mg II, Si II, and Si III, from which we measure a gas-phase abundance of [N/H] = $-1.0\pm 0.1$. Photoionization
models indicate that the nitrogen-to-silicon relative abundance is solar, yet magnesium is underabundant
by a factor of $\approx$ 2. We also report spatially-resolved emission-line spectroscopy of the
nearby galaxy, and we extract its rotation curve. The galaxy's metallicity is $\approx 8 \times$
higher than [N/H] in the absorber, and interestingly, the absorber velocities suggest that the
gas at $\rho =$ 66 kpc is corotating with the galaxy's stellar disk, possibly with an inflow component.
These characteristics could indicate that this sub-DLA system arises in a "cold-accretion" flow.
However, the absorber abundance patterns are peculiar. We hypothesize that the gas was ejected
from its galaxy of origin (or, perhaps is a result of tidal debris from interactions between the group
galaxies) with a solar nitrogen abundance, but that subsequently mixed with (and was diluted by)
gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) or group. If the gas is bound to the nearby galaxy, this system
may be an example of the gas "recycling" predicted by theoretical galaxy simulations. Our hypothesis
is testable with future observations.
