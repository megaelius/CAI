We use detailed numerical simulations of the coupled chemical, thermal and dynamical evolution
of the gas in a turbulent molecular cloud to study the usefulness of the [CI] 609 micron and 370 micron
fine structure emission lines as tracers of cloud structure. Emission from these lines is observed
throughout molecular clouds, and yet the question of what we can learn from them about the physics
of the clouds remains largely unexplored. We show that the fact that [CI] emission is widespread
within molecular clouds is a simple consequence of the fact that the clouds are dominated by turbulent
motions. Turbulence creates large density inhomogeneities, allowing radiation to penetrate
deeply into the clouds. As a result, [CI] emitting gas is found throughout the cloud, rather than
being concentrated at the edges. We examine how well we can use [CI] emission to trace the structure
of the cloud, and show that the integrated intensity of the 609 micron line traces column density
accurately over a wide range of visual extinctions. For extinctions greater than a few, [CI] and
13CO both perform well, but [CI] becomes a superior tracer of column densities for visual extinctions
A_V <= 3 We have also studied the distribution of [CI] excitation temperatures in the gas, and
show that these are typically smaller than the kinetic temperature, indicating that most of the
carbon atoms are not in local thermodynamic equilibrium. We discuss how best to determine T_ex from
observations of the [CI] lines, and how to use these values to estimate the column density of neutral
atomic carbon. We show that even in the best case, we tend to systematically underestimate the atomic
carbon content of the gas. Our results suggest that observationally-derived estimates of the atomic
carbon content of real GMCs could be in error by as much as a factor of two.
