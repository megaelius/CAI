We present a new grid of non-adiabatic, linear pulsation models of Long-Period Variables (LPVs),
including periods and growth rates for radial modes from the fundamental to the fourth overtone.
The models span a wide range in mass, luminosity, metallicity, C/O ratio and helium abundance, effectively
covering the whole thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) evolution, and representing
a significant update with respect to previous works. The main improvement is the inclusion of detailed
atomic and molecular opacities, consistent with the models chemical mixture, that makes the present
set of models the first to systematically account for variability in C-stars. We examine periods
and growth rates in the models, and find that, while the fundamental mode is affected by the structure
of the envelope, overtones are less sensitive to the interior and largely determined by the global
properties. In the models, the frequency of the overtone with the largest degree of excitation is
found to scale with the acoustic cut-off frequency at the stellar surface, a behaviour similar to
that observed for the frequency of maximum oscillation power for solar-like oscillations in less
evolved red giants. This allows us to provide a simple analytic prescription to predict the most-likely
dominant mode as a function of stellar parameters. Best-fit relations for periods are also provided.
By applying results of pulsation models to evolutionary tracks, we present a general picture of
the evolution of long-period variability during the TP-AGB, that we find consistent with observations.
Models are made public through a dedicated web interface.
