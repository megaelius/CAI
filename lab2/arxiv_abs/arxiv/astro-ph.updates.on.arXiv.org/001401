Using the UltraVISTA catalogs, we investigate the evolution in the 11.4 Gyr since z=3 of the progenitors
of local ultra-massive galaxies ($\log{(M_{\rm star}/M_{\odot})}\approx11.8$; UMGs), providing
a complete and consistent picture of how the most massive galaxies at z=0 have assembled. By selecting
the progenitors with a semi-empirical approach using abundance matching, we infer a growth in stellar
mass of 0.56 dex, 0.45 dex, and 0.27 dex from z=3, z=2, and z=1, respectively, to z=0. At z<1, the
progenitors of UMGs constitute a homogeneous population of only quiescent galaxies with old stellar
populations. At z>1, the contribution from star-forming galaxies progressively increases,
with the progenitors at 2<z<3 being dominated by massive ($M_{\rm star} \approx 2 \times
10^{11}$M$_{\odot}$), dusty ($A_{\rm V}\sim$1-2.2 mag), star-forming (SFR$\sim$100-400 M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$) galaxies with a large range in stellar ages. At z=2.75, ~15% of the progenitors are quiescent,
with properties typical of post-starburst galaxies with little dust extinction and strong Balmer
break, and showing a large scatter in color. Our findings indicate that local UMGs have been mostly
assembled between z=3 and z=1.5. Most of the quenching of the star-forming progenitors happened
between z=2.75 and z=1.25, in good agreement with the typical formation redshift and scatter in
age of z=0 UMGs as derived from their fossil records. We show that the progenitors of local UMGs, including
the star-forming ones, have never lived on the blue cloud since z=3, challenging previously proposed
pictures for the formation of local massive spheroids, and we propose an alternative path for the
formation of local UMGs consistent with our findings.
