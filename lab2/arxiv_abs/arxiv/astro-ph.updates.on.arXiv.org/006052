The presence of certain elements within a star, and by extension its planet, strongly impacts the
formation and evolution of the planetary system. The positive correlation between a host star's
iron-content and the presence of an orbiting giant exoplanet has been confirmed (e.g. Valenti &
Fischer 2005). However, the importance of other elements in predicting giant planet occurrence
is less certain despite their central role in shaping internal planetary structure. In order to
understand the subtle, yet crucial way that non-iron elements may influence the formation of giant
planets, we apply advances in data-driven research to the Hypatia Catalog (Hinkel et al. 2014) of
stellar abundances. We designed a machine learning algorithm to analyze stellar abundance patterns
of known host stars, similar to how online streaming services use viewer history to recommend movies,
to determine those elements important in identifying potential giant exoplanet host stars. We
analyzed a variety of scenarios involving different groups of elements, namely volatiles (C, O),
lithophiles (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Mn, Y), siderophiles (Cr, Co, Ni), and Fe. Here we show that
oxygen, carbon, and sodium, besides iron, are influential indicators of a giant planet and we present
a list of ~350 stars that have a $\geq$90% probability of hosting a giant exoplanet. We anticipate
that our findings will revolutionize the determination of interior structure models for both giant
and terrestrial planets. Furthermore, our results demonstrate how this planet-finding algorithm
can be used to guide future target lists, such as the TESS, CHEOPS, JWST, and WFIRST missions.
