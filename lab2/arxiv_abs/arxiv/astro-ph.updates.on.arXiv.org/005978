The current $3.4 \sigma$ tension between local (arXiv:1604.01424) and global (arXiv:1605.02985)
measurements of $H_0$ cannot be fully explained by the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. It could
be produced by unknown systematics or by physics beyond the standard model. In particular, non-standard
dark energy models were shown to be able to alleviate this tension. On the other hand, it is well known
that linear perturbation theory predicts a cosmic variance on the Hubble parameter $H_0$, which
leads to systematic errors on its local determination. Here, we study how including in the likelihood
the cosmic variance on $H_0$ affects statistical inference. In particular we consider the $\gamma$CDM,
$w$CDM and $\gamma w$CDM parametric extensions of the standard model, which we constrain with CMB,
BAO, SNe Ia, RSD and $H_0$ data. We learn two important lessons. First, the systematic error from
cosmic variance is -- independently of the model -- approximately $\sigma_{\text{cv}}\approx
2$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and of the same order of the uncertainty $1.74$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$
on local $H_0$. Taking into account cosmic variance, the tension is reduced to $2.4 \sigma$ so that
the cosmology-independent estimate by Riess et al. (arXiv:1604.01424) can be included in cosmological
analyses without the risk of artificially biasing the results. Second, cosmic variance, besides
shifting the constraints, can drastically change the results of model selection: much of the statistical
advantage of non-standard models is to alleviate the now-reduced tension. We conclude that it is
crucial to include the cosmic variance on $H_0$ if one wants to use the local determination of the
Hubble constant by Riess et al. (arXiv:1604.01424). Doing the contrary could potentially bias
the conclusions.
