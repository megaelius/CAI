Based on CMB maps from the 2013 Planck Mission data release, this paper presents the detection of
the ISW effect, i.e., the correlation between the CMB and large-scale evolving gravitational potentials.
The significance of detection ranges from 2 to 4 sigma, depending on which method is used. We investigate
three separate approaches, which cover essentially all previous studies, as well as breaking new
ground. (i) Correlation of the CMB with the Planck reconstructed gravitational lensing potential
(for the first time). This detection is made using the lensing-induced bispectrum; the correlation
between lensing and the ISW effect has a significance close to 2.5 sigma. (ii) Cross-correlation
with tracers of LSS, yielding around 3 sigma significance, based on a combination of radio (NVSS)
and optical (SDSS) data. (iii) Aperture photometry on stacked CMB fields at the locations of known
large-scale structures, which yields a 4 sigma signal when using a previously explored catalogue,
but shows strong discrepancies in amplitude and scale compared to expectations. Recent catalogues
give more moderate results, ranging from negligible to 2.5 sigma at most, but with a more consistent
scale and amplitude, the latter being still slightly above what is expected from numerical simulations
within LCMD. Where they can be compared, these measurements are compatible with previous work using
data from WMAP, which had already mapped these scales to the limits of cosmic variance. Planck's
broader frequency coverage confirms that the signal is achromatic, bolstering the case for ISW
detection. As a final step we use tracers of large-scale structure to filter the CMB data, presenting
maps of the ISW temperature perturbation. These results provide complementary and independent
evidence for the existence of a dark energy component that governs the current accelerated expansion
of the Universe.
