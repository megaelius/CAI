Mass and radius are two fundamental properties for characterising exoplanets, but only for a relatively
small fraction of exoplanets are they both available. Mass is often derived from radial velocity
measurements, while the radius is almost always measured using the transit method. For a large number
of exoplanets, either the radius or the mass is unknown, while the host star has been characterised.
Several mass-radius relations that are dependent on the planet's type have been published that
often allow us to predict the radius. Our goal is to derive the radius of exoplanets using only observables
extracted from spectra used primarily to determine radial velocities and spectral parameters.
Our objective is to obtain a mass-radius relation independent of the planet's type. We worked with
a database of confirmed exoplanets with known radii and masses, as well as the planets from our Solar
System. Using random forests, a machine learning algorithm, we computed the radius of exoplanets
and compared the results to the published radii. Our code, Bem, is available online. The estimated
radii reproduces the spread in radius found for high mass planets better than previous mass-radius
relations. The average radius error is 1.8 $R_{\oplus}$ across the whole range of radii from 1-22
$R_{\oplus}$. We find that a random forest algorithm is able to derive reliable radii, especially
for planets between 4 $R_{\oplus}$ and 20 $R_{\oplus}$ for which the error is under 25$\%$. The algorithm
has a low bias yet a high variance, which could be reduced by limiting the growth of the forest, or adding
more data. The random forest algorithm is a promising method for deriving exoplanet properties.
We show that the exoplanet's mass and equilibrium temperature are the relevant properties that
constrain the radius, and do so with higher accuracy than the previous methods.
