Asteroids can be classified into several groups based on their spectral reflectance. Among these
groups, the one belonging to the L-class in the taxonomic classification based on visible and near-infrared
spectra exhibit several peculiar properties. First, their near-infrared spectrum is characterized
by a strong absorption band interpreted as the diagnostic of a high content of the FeO bearing spinel
mineral. This mineral is one of the main constituents of Calcium-Aluminum-rich Inclusions (CAI)
the oldest mineral compounds found in the solar system. In polarimetry, they possess an uncommonly
large value of the inversion angle incompatible with all known asteroid belonging to other taxonomical
classes. Asteroids found to possess such a high inversion angle are commonly called Barbarians
based on the first asteroid on which this property was first identified, (234)~Barbara. In this
paper we present the results of an extensive campaign of polarimetric and spectroscopic observations
of L-class objects. We have derived phase-polarization curves for a sample of 7 Barbarians, finding
a variety of inversion angles ranging between 25 and 30$^{\circ}$. Spectral reflectance data exhibit
variations in terms of spectral slope and absorption features in the near-infrared. We analyzed
these data using a Hapke model to obtain some inferences about the relative abundance of CAI and other
mineral compounds. By combining spectroscopic and polarimetric results, we find evidence that
the polarimetric inversion angle is directly correlated with the presence of CAI, and the peculiar
polarimetric properties of Barbarians are primarily a consequence of their anomalous composition.
