The sensitivity of the the pyramid wavefront sensor (PyWFS) has made it a popular choice for astronomical
adaptive optics (AAO) systems, and it is at its most sensitive when it is used without modulation
of the input beam. In non-modulated mode, the device is highly nonlinear. Hence, all PyWFS implementations
on current AAO systems employ modulation to make the device more linear. The upcoming era of 30-m
class telescopes and the demand for ultra-precise wavefront control stemming from science objectives
that include direct imaging of exoplanets make using the PyWFS without modulation desirable. This
article argues that nonlinear estimation based on Newton's method for nonlinear optimization
can be useful for mitigating the effects of nonlinearity in the non-modulated PyWFS. The proposed
approach requires all optical modeling to be pre-computed, which has the advantage of avoiding
real-time simulations of beam propagation. Further, the required real-time calculations are
amenable to massively parallel computation. Numerical experiments simulate a currently operational
PyWFS. A singular value analysis shows that the common practice of calculating two "slope" images
from the four PyWFS pupil images discards critical information and is unsuitable for the non-modulated
PyWFS simulated here. Instead, this article advocates estimators that use the raw pixel values
not only from the four geometrical images of the pupil, but from surrounding pixels as well. The simulations
indicate that nonlinear estimation can be effective when the Strehl ratio of the input beam is greater
than 0.3, and the improvement relative to linear estimation tends to increase at larger Strehl ratios.
At Strehl ratios less than about 0.5, the performances of both the nonlinear and linear estimators
are relatively insensitive to noise, since they are dominated by nonlinearity error.
