We have investigated the properties of gravito-turbulent discs in 3D using high-resolution shearing-box
simulations. For large enough domain sizes, $L_y \gtrsim 60H$, the disc settles down into a quasi-steady
state, showing no long term trends in properties or variation with box size. For smaller boxes, we
find that the azimuthal wavelength of the dominant spiral modes are limited to the domain size. This
is associated with a bursty behaviour that differs from the quasi-steady dynamics at larger sizes.
We point out that a similar transition may be expected in global simulations at the point where the
range of azimuthal wavelengths is limited by the finite disc size. This condition (i.e. when $60
H \sim 2 \pi R$, i.e. $H/R \sim 0.1$) correctly predicts the transition to bursty behaviour previously
found in global simulations for disc-to-star mass ratios in excess of 0.25. We recover a transition
in the dynamics from two- to three-dimensional behaviour, characterized by a turbulence that becomes
more isotropic on small scales. This turbulence likely plays an important role in the evolution
of dust in self-gravitating discs, potentially dominating the collision velocity for particles
with Stokes number $< 1$. Finally, we consider the stability of gravito-turbulence against fragmentation,
finding that discs which cool faster than a few dynamical times fragment immediately, supporting
previous results. We also find hints of stochastic fragmentation at marginally longer cooling
times, in which a fragment forms from a quasi-equilibrium state. However, this makes little practical
difference to region where planet formation via gravitational instability may occur.
