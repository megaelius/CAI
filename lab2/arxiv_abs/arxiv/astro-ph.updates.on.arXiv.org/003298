Chondrules in primitive meteorites likely formed by recrystallisation of dust aggregates that
were flash-heated to nearly complete melting. Chondrules may represent the building blocks of
rocky planetesimals and protoplanets in the inner regions of protoplanetary discs, but the source
of ubiquitous thermal processing of their dust aggregate precursors remains elusive. Here we demonstrate
that escape of positrons released in the decay of the short-lived radionuclide $^{26}$Al leads
to a large-scale charging of dense pebble structures, resulting in neutralisation by lightning
discharge and flash-heating of dust and pebbles. This charging mechanism is similar to a nuclear
battery where a radioactive source charges a capacitor. We show that the nuclear battery effect
operates in circumplanetesimal pebble discs. The extremely high pebble densities in such discs
are consistent with conditions during chondrule heating inferred from the high abundance of sodium
within chondrules. The sedimented mid-plane layer of the protoplanetary disc may also be prone
to charging by the emission of positrons, if the mass density of small dust there is at least an order
of magnitude above the gas density. Our results imply that the decay energy of $^{26}$Al can be harvested
to drive intense lightning activity in protoplanetary discs. The total energy stored in positron
emission is comparable to the energy needed to melt all solids in the protoplanetary disc. The efficiency
of transferring the positron energy to the electric field nevertheless depends on the relatively
unknown distribution and scale-dependence of pebble density gradients in circumplanetesimal
pebble discs and in the protoplanetary disc mid-plane layer.
