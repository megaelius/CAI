We present improved constraints on an interacting vacuum model using updated astronomical observations
including the first data release from Planck. We consider a model with one dimensionless parameter,
$\alpha$, describing the interaction between dark matter and vacuum energy (with fixed equation
of state $w=-1$). The background dynamics correspond to a generalised Chaplygin gas cosmology,
but the perturbations have a zero sound speed. The tension between the value of the Hubble constant,
$H_0$, determined by Planck data plus WMAP polarisation (Planck+WP) and that determined by the
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) can be alleviated by energy transfer from dark matter to vacuum ($\alpha>0$).
A positive $\alpha$ increases the allowed values of $H_0$ due to parameter degeneracy within the
model using only CMB data. Combining with additional datasets of including supernova type Ia (SN
Ia) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), we can significantly tighten the bounds on $\alpha$.
Redshift-space distortions (RSD), which constrain the linear growth of structure, provide the
tightest constraints on vacuum interaction when combined with Planck+WP, and prefer energy transfer
from vacuum to dark matter ($\alpha<0$) which suppresses the growth of structure. Using the
combined datasets of Planck+WP+Union2.1+BAO+RSD, we obtain the constraint on $\alpha$ to be $-0.083<\alpha<-0.006$
(95% C.L.), allowing low $H_0$ consistent with the measurement from 6dF Galaxy survey. This interacting
vacuum model can alleviate the tension between RSD and Planck+WP in the $\Lambda$CDM model for $\alpha<0$,
or between HST measurements of $H_0$ and Planck+WP for $\alpha>0$, but not both at the same time.
