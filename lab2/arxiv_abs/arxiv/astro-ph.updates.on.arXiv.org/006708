It has recently been noted that there seems to be a strong correlation between planetary nebulae
with close binary central stars, and highly enhanced recombination line abundances. We present
new deep spectra of seven objects known to have close binary central stars, and find that the heavy
element abundances derived from recombination lines exceed those from collisionally excited
lines by factors of 5-95, placing several of these nebulae among the most extreme known abundance
discrepancies. This study nearly doubles the number of nebulae known to have a binary central star
and an extreme abundance discrepancy. A statistical analysis of all nebulae with measured recombination
line abundances reveals no link between central star surface chemistry and nebular abundance discrepancy,
but a clear link between binarity and the abundance discrepancy, as well as an anti-correlation
between abundance discrepancies and nebular electron densities: all nebulae with a binary central
star with a period of less than 1.15 days have an abundance discrepancy factor exceeding 10, and an
electron density less than $\sim$1000 cm$^{-3}$; those with longer period binaries have abundance
discrepancy factors less than 10 and much higher electron densities. We find that [O~{\sc ii}] density
diagnostic lines can be strongly enhanced by recombination excitation, while [S~{\sc ii}] lines
are not. These findings give weight to the idea that extreme abundance discrepancies are caused
by a nova-like eruption from the central star system, occurring soon after the common-envelope
phase, which ejects material depleted in hydrogen, and enhanced in CNONe but not in third-row elements.
