We present a detailed elemental abundance study of 90 F and G dwarf, turn-off and subgiant stars in
the Galactic bulge. Based on high-resolution spectra acquired during gravitational microlensing
events, stellar ages and abundances for 11 elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Zn, Y and Ba) have
been determined. We find that the Galactic bulge has a wide metallicity distribution with significant
peaks at [Fe/H]=-1.09, -0.63, -0.20, +0.12, +0.41. We also find a high fraction of intermediate-age
to young stars: at [Fe/H]>0 more than 35 % are younger than 8 Gyr. For [Fe/H]<-0.5 most stars are 10
Gyr or older. We have also identified several episodes when significant star formation in the bulge
happened: 3, 6, 8, and 12 Gyr ago. We further find that the "knee" in the alpha-element abundance trends
of the sub-solar metallicity bulge is located at about 0.1 dex higher [Fe/H] than in the local thick
disk. The Galactic bulge has complex age and abundance properties that appear to be tightly connected
to the main Galactic stellar populations. In particular, the peaks in the metallicity distribution,
the star formation episodes, and the abundance trends, show similarities with the properties of
the Galactic thin and thick disks. At the same time there are additional components not seen outside
the bulge region, and that most likely can be associated with the Galactic bar. For instance, the
star formation rate appears to have been slightly faster in the bulge than in the local thick disk,
which most likely is an indication of the denser stellar environment closer to the Galactic centre.
Our results strengthen the observational evidence that support the idea of a secular origin for
the Galactic bulge, formed out of the other main Galactic stellar populations present in the central
regions of our Galaxy.
