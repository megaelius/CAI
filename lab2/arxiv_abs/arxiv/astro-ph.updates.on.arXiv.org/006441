The imaging and spectroscopy of habitable worlds will require large-aperture space-based telescopes,
to increase the collecting area and the angular resolution. These large telescopes will necessarily
use segmented primaries to fit in a rocket. However, these massively segmented mirrors make high-contrast
performance very difficult to achieve and stabilize, compared to more common monolithic primaries.
Despite space telescopes operating in a friendlier environment than ground-based telescopes,
remaining vibrations and resonant modes on the segments can still deteriorate the performance.
In this context, we present the Pair-based Analytical model for Segmented Telescopes Imaging from
Space (PASTIS) that enables the establishment of a comprehensive error budget, both in term of segment
alignment and stability. Using this model, one may evaluate the influence of the segment cophasing
and surface quality evolution on the final images and contrasts, and set up requirements for any
given mission. One can also identify the dominant modes of a given geometry for a given coronagraphic
instrument and design the feedback control systems accordingly. In this paper, we first develop
and validate this analytical model by comparing its outputs to the images and contrasts predicted
by an end-to-end simulation. We show that the contrasts predicted using PASTIS are accurate enough
compared to the end-to-end propagation results, at the exo-Earth detection level. Second, we develop
a method for a fast and efficient error budget in term of segment manufacturing and alignment that
takes into account the disparities of the segment effects on the final performance. This technique
is then applied on a specific aperture to provide static and quasi-static requirements on each segment
for local aberrations. Finally we discuss potential application of this new technique to future
missions.
