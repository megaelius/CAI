Two years' worth of u-, g-, r-, i-, and z-band optical light curves were obtained for the massive type
1 quasar PG 2308+098 at z=0.433 using the 1.05-m Kiso Schmidt telescope/Kiso Wide Field Camera,
and inter-band time lags of the light curves were measured. Wavelength-dependent continuum reverberation
lag signals of several tens of days relative to the u-band were detected at g-, r-, i-, and z-bands,
where the longer wavelength bands showed larger lags. From the wavelength-dependent lags, and
assuming the standard disk temperature radial profile $T \propto R_{\rm disk}^{-3/4}$ and an X-ray/far-ultraviolet
reprocessing picture, a constraint on the radius of the accretion disk responsible for the rest-frame
2500 \AA\ disk continuum emission was derived as $R_{\rm disk} = 9.46^{+0.29}_{-3.12}$ light-days.
The derived disk size is slightly (1.2-1.8 times) larger than the theoretical disk size of $R_{\rm
disk} = 5.46$ light-days predicted from the black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and Eddington ratio estimates
of PG 2308+098. This result is roughly in accordance with previous studies of lower mass active galactic
nuclei (AGNs), where measured disk sizes have been found to be larger than the standard disk model
predictions by a factor of $\sim 3$; however, the disk size discrepancy is more modest in PG 2308+098.
By compiling literature values of the disk size constraints from continuum reverberation and gravitational
microlensing observations for AGNs/quasars, we show that the $M_{\rm BH}$ dependence of $R_{\rm
disk}$ is weaker than that expected from the standard disk model. These observations suggest that
the standard Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disk theory has limitations in describing AGN/quasar
accretion disks.
