Using three-dimensional, moving-mesh simulations, we investigate the future evolution of the
recently discovered gas cloud G2 traveling through the galactic center. We consider the case of
a spherical cloud initially in pressure equilibrium with the background. Our suite of simulations
explores the following parameters: the equation of state, radial profiles of the background gas,
and start times for the evolution. Our primary focus is on how the fate of this cloud will affect the
future activity of Sgr A*. From our simulations we expect an average feeding rate in the range of $5-19
\times 10^{-8}$ solar masses per year beginning in 2013 and lasting for at least 7 years (our simulations
stop in year 2020). The accretion varies by less than a factor of three on timescales <1 month,
and shows no more than a factor of 10 difference between the maximum and minimum. These rates are comparable
to the current estimated accretion rate in the immediate vicinity of Sgr A*, although they represent
only a small (<5%) increase over the current expected feeding rate at the effective inner boundary
of our simulations. Therefore, the break up of cloud G2 may have only a minimal effect on the brightness
and variability of Sgr A* over the next decade. This is because current models of the galactic center
predict that most of the gas will be caught up in outflows. However, if the accreted G2 material can
remain cold, it may not mix well with the hot, diffuse background gas, and instead accrete efficiently
onto Sgr A*. Further observations of G2 will give us an unprecedented opportunity to test this idea.
The break up of the cloud itself may also be observable. By tracking the amount of cloud energy that
is dissipated during our simulations, we are able to get a rough estimate of the luminosity associated
with its tidal disruption; we find values of a few $10^{36}$ erg/s.
