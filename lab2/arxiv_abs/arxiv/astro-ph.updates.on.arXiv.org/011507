Extragalactic studies have demonstrated that there is a moderately tight ($\approx$ 0.3 dex) relationship
between galaxy stellar mass ($M_{\star}$) and star formation rate (SFR) that holds for star-forming
galaxies at $M_{\star} \sim 3 \times 10^8$-10$^{11}~M_{\odot}$. This relationship has often
been referred to as the "star formation main sequence." However, it has yet to be determined whether
such a relationship extends to even lower mass galaxies. Here, we present new results using observations
for 777 narrowband H$\alpha$-selected galaxies with stellar masses between $10^6$ and $10^{10}~M_{\odot}$
(average of $10^{8.2}~M_{\odot}$) at $z \approx$ 0.07--0.5. These galaxies have sensitive UV
to near-infrared photometric measurements and optical spectroscopy. The latter allows us to correct
our H$\alpha$\ SFRs for dust attenuation using Balmer decrements. Our study reveals: (1) for low-SFR
galaxies, our H$\alpha$ SFRs systematically underpredicts compared to FUV measurements; (2)
on average, sSFR increases with decreasing stellar mass, but at a slower rate compared to more massive
galaxies; (3) the SFR--$M_{\star}$ relation holds for galaxies down to $\sim$10$^6~M_{\odot}$
($\sim$1.5 dex below previous studies), and follows a redshift-dependent main-sequence relation
of $\log{({\rm SFR})} \propto \alpha \log{M_{\star}} + \beta z$ with $\alpha=0.58 \pm 0.01$ and
$\beta=2.08 \pm 0.07$, over lookback times of up to 5 Gyr; (4) the intrinsic dispersion in the SFR--$M_{\star}$
relation at low stellar masses is $\approx0.3$ dex with no strong evidence that lower mass galaxies
display a larger dispersion, consistent with results obtained at similar or higher stellar masses.
