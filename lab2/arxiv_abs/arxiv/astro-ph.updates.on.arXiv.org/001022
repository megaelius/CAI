Context: Solar pores are small sunspots lacking penumbra with prevailing vertical magnetic field
component. They can include light bridges at places with locally reduced magnetic field. Like sunspots,
they exhibit a wide range of oscillatory phenomena. Aims: A large isolated pore with a light bridge
(NOAA 11005) is studied to obtain characteristics of a chromospheric filamentary structure around
the pore, to analyse oscillations and waves in and around the pore, and to understand the structure
and brightness of the light bridge. Methods: Spectral imaging observations in the line Ca II 854.2
nm and a complementary spectropolarimetry in Fe I lines, obtained with the DST/IBIS spectrometer
and HINODE/SOT spectropolarimeter, are used to measure photospheric and chromospheric velocity
fields, oscillations, waves, magnetic field in the photosphere, and acoustic energy flux and radiative
losses in the chromosphere. Results: The chromospheric filamentary structure around the pore
has all important characteristics of a superpenumbra: presence of the inverse Evershed effect
and running waves, morphology, and character of oscillations. The granular structure of the light
bridge in the upper photosphere can be explained by radiative heating. Acoustic waves leaking up
from the photosphere along inclined magnetic field in the light bridge transfer enough energy flux
to cover the total radiative losses of the light-bridge chromosphere. Conclusions: The presence
of a penumbra is not a necessary condition for the formation of a superpenumbra. The light bridge
is heated by radiation in the photosphere and by acoustic waves in the chromosphere.
