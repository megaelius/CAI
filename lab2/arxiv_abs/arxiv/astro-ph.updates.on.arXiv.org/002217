Massive stars are important for the chemical enrichment of the universe. Since internal mixing
processes influence their life, it is of high importance to place constraints on the corresponding
physical parameters, such as core overshooting and the internal rotation profile, to calibrate
their stellar structure and evolution models. Although asteroseismology was shown to be able to
deliver the most precise constraints so far, the number of detailed seismic studies delivering
quantitative results is limited. Our goal is to extend this limited sample with an in-depth case
study and provide a well constrained set of asteroseismic parameters, contributing to the ongoing
mapping efforts of the instability strips of the beta Cep and SPB stars. We derived fundamental parameters
from high-resolution spectra using spectral synthesis techniques. We used custom masks to obtain
optimal light curves from the original pixel level data from the Kepler satellite. We used standard
time-series analysis tools to construct a set of significant pulsation modes which provide the
basis for the seismic analysis carried out afterwards. We find that KIC 10526294 is a cool SPB star,
one of the slowest rotators ever found. Despite this fact, the length of Kepler observations is sufficient
to resolve narrow rotationally split multiplets for each of its nineteen quasi-equally spaced
dipole modes. The number of detected consecutive (in radial order) dipole modes in this series is
higher than ever before. The observed amount of splitting shows an increasing trend towards longer
periods, which - largely independent of the seismically calibrated stellar models - points towards
a non-rigid internal rotation profile. From the average splitting we deduce a rotation period of
188 d. From seismic modelling we find that the star is young with a central hydrogen mass fraction
X_c>0.64; it has a core overshooting alpha_ov<=0.15.
