We show that the luminous supernovae associated with ultra-long gamma-ray bursts can be caused
by the slow adiabatic cooling of hydrogen-free progenitors extended by pulsational pair-instability.
In the accompanying paper (Marchant & Moriya 2020), we have shown that some rapidly-rotating hydrogen-free
gamma-ray burst progenitors that experience pulsational pair-instability can keep an extended
structure caused by pulsational pair-instability until the core collapse. Such progenitors have
large radii exceeding 10 Rsun and they sometimes reach beyond 1000 Rsun at the time of the core collapse.
They are, therefore, promising progenitors of ultra-long gamma-ray bursts. We here perform the
light-curve modeling of the explosions of one extended hydrogen-free progenitor with a radius
of 1962 Rsun. Thanks to the large progenitor radius, the ejecta experience slow adiabatic cooling
and they become rapidly evolving (<~ 10 days) luminous (>~ 1e43 erg/s) supernovae even without the
energy input from the 56Ni nuclear decay. They also have fast photospheric velocity above 10,000
km/s and hot photospheric temperature above 10,000 K at around the peak luminosity. We find that
SN 2011kl, which is associated with the ultra-long gamma-ray burst GRB 111209A, can be explained
by the adiabatic cooling phase of the extended progenitor. The ultra-long gamma-ray burst progenitors
proposed in Marchant & Moriya 2020 can explain both the ultra-long gamma-ray burst duration and
the accompanying supernova properties. When the gamma-ray burst jet is off-axis or choked, the
luminous supernovae could be observed as fast blue optical transients without accompanying gamma-ray
bursts.
