In the interstellar medium, carbon is distributed between the gas and solid phases. However, while
about half of the expected carbon abundance can be accounted for in the gas phase, there is considerable
uncertainty as to the amount incorporated in interstellar dust. The aliphatic component of the
carbonaceous dust is of particular interest because it produces a significant 3.4 $\mu$m absorption
feature when viewed against a background radiation source. The optical depth of the 3.4 $\mu$m absorption
feature is related to the number of aliphatic carbon C-H bonds along the line of sight. It is possible
to estimate the column density of carbon locked up in the aliphatic hydrocarbon component of interstellar
dust from quantitative analysis of the 3.4 $\mu$m interstellar absorption feature providing that
the absorption coefficient of aliphatic hydrocarbons incorporated in the interstellar dust is
known. We generated laboratory analogues of interstellar dust by experimentally mimicking interstellar/circumstellar
conditions. The resultant spectra of these dust analogues closely match those from astronomical
observations. The measurements of the absorption coefficient of aliphatic hydrocarbons incorporated
in the analogues were carried out by a procedure which combined FTIR and $^{13}$C NMR spectroscopies.
The absorption coefficients obtained for both interstellar analogues were found to be in close
agreement (4.76(8) $\times$ 10$^{-18}$ cm group$^{-1}$ and 4.69(14) $\times$ 10$^{-18}$ cm group$^{-1}$),
less than half those obtained in studies using small aliphatic molecules. The results thus obtained
permit direct calibration of the astronomical observations, providing rigorous estimates of
the amount of aliphatic carbon in the interstellar medium.
