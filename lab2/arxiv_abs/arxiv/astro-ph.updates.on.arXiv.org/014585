A few fast radio bursts' (FRBs) light-curves have exhibited large intrinsic modulations of their
flux on extremely short ($t_{\rm r}\sim 10\mu$s) time scales, compared to pulse durations ($t_{\rm
FRB}\sim1$ms). Light-curve variability timescales, the small ratio of rise time of the flux to
pulse duration, and the spectro-temporal correlations in the data constrain the compactness of
the source and the mechanism responsible for the powerful radio emission. The constraints are strongest
when radiation is produced far ($\gtrsim 10^{10}$cm) from the compact object. We describe different
physical set-ups that can account for the observed $t_{\rm r}/t_{\rm FRB}\ll 1$ despite having
large emission radii. The result is either a significant reduction in the radio production efficiency
or distinct light-curves features that could be searched for in observed data. For the same class
of models, we also show that due to high-latitude emission, if a flux $f_1(\nu_1)$ is observed at
$t_1$ then at a lower frequency $\nu_2<\nu_1$ the flux should be at least $(\nu_2/\nu_1)^2f_1$
at a slightly later time ($t_2=t_1\nu_1/\nu_2$) independent of the duration and spectrum of the
emission in the comoving frame. These features can be tested, once light-curve modulations due
to scintillation are accounted for. We provide the timescales and coherence bandwidths of the latter
for a range of possibilities regarding the physical screens and the scintillation regime. Finally,
if future highly resolved FRB light-curves are shown to have intrinsic variability extending down
to $\sim \mu$s timescales, this will provide strong evidence in favor of magnetospheric models.
