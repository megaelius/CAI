The time-variable velocity fields of solar-type stars limit the precision of radial-velocity
determinations of their planets' masses, obstructing detection of Earth twins. Since 2015 July
we have been monitoring disc-integrated sunlight in daytime using a purpose-built solar telescope
and fibre feed to the HARPS-N stellar radial-velocity spectrometer. We present and analyse the
solar radial-velocity measurements and cross-correlation function (CCF) parameters obtained
in the first 3 years of observation, interpreting them in the context of spatially-resolved solar
observations. We describe a Bayesian mixture-model approach to automated data-quality monitoring.
We provide dynamical and daily differential-extinction corrections to place the radial velocities
in the heliocentric reference frame, and the CCF shape parameters in the sidereal frame. We achieve
a photon-noise limited radial-velocity precision better than 0.43 m s$^{-1}$ per 5-minute observation.
The day-to-day precision is limited by zero-point calibration uncertainty with an RMS scatter
of about 0.4 m s$^{-1}$. We find significant signals from granulation and solar activity. Within
a day, granulation noise dominates, with an amplitude of about 0.4 m s$^{-1}$ and an autocorrelation
half-life of 15 minutes. On longer timescales, activity dominates. Sunspot groups broaden the
CCF as they cross the solar disc. Facular regions temporarily reduce the intrinsic asymmetry of
the CCF. The radial-velocity increase that accompanies an active-region passage has a typical
amplitude of 5 m s$^{-1}$ and is correlated with the line asymmetry, but leads it by 3 days. Spectral
line-shape variability thus shows promise as a proxy for recovering the true radial velocity.
