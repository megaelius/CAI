While planets are commonly discovered around main-sequence stars, the processes leading to their
formation are still far from being understood. Current planet population synthesis models, which
aim to describe the planet formation process from the protoplanetary disk phase to the time exoplanets
are observed, rely on prescriptions for the underlying properties of protoplanetary disks where
planets form and evolve. The recent development in measuring disk masses and disk-star interaction
properties, i.e., mass accretion rates, in large samples of young stellar objects demand a more
careful comparison between the models and the data. We performed an initial critical assessment
of the assumptions made by planet synthesis population models by looking at the relation between
mass accretion rates and disk masses in the models and in the currently available data. We find that
the currently used disk models predict mass accretion rate in line with what is measured, but with
a much lower spread of values than observed. This difference is mainly because the models have a smaller
spread of viscous timescales than what is needed to reproduce the observations. We also find an overabundance
of weakly accreting disks in the models where giant planets have formed with respect to observations
of typical disks. We suggest that either fewer giant planets have formed in reality or that the prescription
for planet accretion predicts accretion on the planets that is too high. Finally, the comparison
of the properties of transition disks with large cavities confirms that in many of these objects
the observed accretion rates are higher than those predicted by the models. On the other hand, PDS70,
a transition disk with two detected giant planets in the cavity, shows mass accretion rates well
in line with model predictions.
