A number of Local Group dwarf galaxies are known to have two spatially segregated stellar metallicity
populations, a centrally concentrated metal-rich population and a more extended metal-poor population.
In this work we discuss mechanisms that lead to the formation of two spatially segregated metallicity
populations. Using a set of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of Local Group-like environments,
we select a sample of satellite and field galaxies, spanning the stellar mass range $10^6-10^9$M$_{\odot}$,
that exhibit bimodality in their metallicity distributions. Among those, we identify a subsample
with a strong spatial segregation in the two populations. We find three distinct mechanisms for
their formation. In field dwarfs and in a small fraction of satellites, a merger causes the metal-poor
stars to migrate to larger radii and encourages the available gas to sink to the centre of the dwarf.
Most of the gas is subsequently blown out of the halo through star formation feedback, but the remaining
gas is consumed in the formation of a metal-rich population. In the exclusive case of satellites
that have retained some of their gas at infall, it is the compression of this gas by ram pressure near
pericentre that triggers the formation of metal-rich stars, whilst simultaneously preventing
star formation at larger radii through stripping. Additionally, in a small number of field and satellite
dwarfs, interactions with gaseous filaments and other galaxies can result in the formation of a
metal-rich population. Regardless of the formation mechanism, a history of mergers typically
enhances the spatial segregation.
