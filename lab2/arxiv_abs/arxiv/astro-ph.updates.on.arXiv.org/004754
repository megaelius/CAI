NASA's Kepler mission has discovered thousands of planetary systems, ~20% of which are found to
host multiple transiting planets. This relative paucity (compared to the high fraction of single
transiting systems) is postulated to result from a distinction in the architecture between multi-transiting
systems and those hosting a single transiting planet: a phenomenon usually referred to as the Kepler
dichotomy. In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that external giant planets are the main
cause behind the over-abundance of single- relative to multi-transiting systems, which would
be signaled by higher metallicities in the former sample. To this end, we perform a statistical analysis
on the stellar metallicity distribution with respect to planet multiplicity in the Kepler data.
We perform our analysis on a variety of samples taken from a population of 1166 Kepler main sequence
planetary hosts, using precisely determined metallicities from the California-Kepler survey
and Swift et al. (2015). Contrary to some predictions, we do not find a significant difference between
the stellar metallicities of the single- and multiple-transiting planet systems. However, we
do find a 55% upper bound for systems with a single non-giant planet that could also host a hidden giant
planet, based on metallicity considerations. While the presence of external giant planets might
be one factor behind the Kepler dichotomy, our results also favor alternative explanations. We
suggest that additional radial velocity and direct imaging measurements are necessary to constrain
the presence of gas giants in systems with a single transiting planet.
