Contradictory results have been reported on the time evolution of the alignment between clusters
and their Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG). We study this topic by analyzing cosmological hydro-simulations
of 24 massive clusters with $M_{200}|_{z=0} \gtrsim 10^{15}\, M_\odot$, plus 5 less massive with
$1 \times 10^{14} \lesssim M_{200}|_{z=0} \lesssim 7 \times 10^{14}\, M_\odot$, which have already
proven to produce realistic BCG masses. We compute the BCG alignment with both the distribution
of cluster galaxies and the dark matter (DM) halo. At redshift $z=0$, the major axes of the simulated
BCGs and their host cluster galaxy distributions are aligned on average within 20$^\circ$. The
BCG alignment with the DM halo is even tighter. The alignment persists up to $z\lesssim2$ with no
evident evolution. This result continues, although with a weaker signal, when considering the
projected alignment. The cluster alignment with the surrounding distribution of matter ($3R_{200}$)
is already in place at $z\sim4$ with a typical angle of $35^\circ$, before the BCG-Cluster alignment
develops. The BCG turns out to be also aligned with the same matter distribution, albeit always to
a lesser extent. These results taken together might imply that the BCG-Cluster alignment occurs
in an outside-in fashion. Depending on their frequency and geometry, mergers can promote, destroy
or weaken the alignments. Clusters that do not experience recent major mergers are typically more
relaxed and aligned with their BCG. In turn, accretions closer to the cluster elongation axis tend
to improve the alignment as opposed to accretions closer to the cluster minor axis.
