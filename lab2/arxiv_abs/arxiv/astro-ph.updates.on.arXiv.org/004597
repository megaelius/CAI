NASA's SLS and Orion crew vehicle will launch humans to cislunar space to begin the new era of space
exploration. NASA plans to use the Orion crew vehicle to transport humans between Earth and cislunar
space where there will be a stationed habitat known as the Deep Space Gateway (DSG). The proximity
to the lunar surface allows for direct communication between the DSG and surface assets, which enables
low-latency telerobotic exploration. The operational constraints for telerobotics must be fully
explored on Earth before being utilized on space exploration missions. We identified two constraints
on space exploration using low-latency surface telerobotics and attempts to quantify these constraints.
A constraint associated with low-latency surface telerobotics is the bandwidth available between
the orbiting command station and the ground assets. The bandwidth available will vary during operation.
As a result, it is critical to quantify the operational video conditions required for effective
exploration. We designed an experiment to quantify the threshold frame rate required for effective
exploration. The experiment simulated geological exploration via low-latency surface telerobotics
using a COTS rover in a lunar analog environment. The results from this experiment indicate that
humans should operate above a threshold frame rate of 5 frames per second. In a separate, but similar
experiment, we introduced a 2.6 second delay in the video system. This delay recreated the latency
conditions present when operating rovers on the lunar farside from an Earth-based command station.
This time delay was compared to low-latency conditions for teleoperation at the DSG ($\leq$0.4
seconds). The results from this experiment show a 150% increase in exploration time when the latency
is increased to 2.6 seconds. This indicates that such a delay significantly complicates real-time
exploration strategies.
