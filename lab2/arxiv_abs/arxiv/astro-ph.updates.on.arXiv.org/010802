We present initial results from the K-band focal plane array Examinations of Young STellar Object
Natal Environments (KEYSTONE) survey, a large project on the 100-m Green Bank Telescope mapping
ammonia emission across eleven giant molecular clouds at distances of $0.9-3.0$ kpc (Cygnus X North,
Cygnus X South, M16, M17, MonR1, MonR2, NGC2264, NGC7538, Rosette, W3, and W48). This data release
includes the NH$_3$ (1,1) and (2,2) maps for each cloud, which are modeled to produce maps of kinetic
temperature, centroid velocity, velocity dispersion, and ammonia column density. Median cloud
kinetic temperatures range from $11.4\pm2.2$ K in the coldest cloud (MonR1) to $23.0\pm6.5$ K in
the warmest cloud (M17). Using dendrograms on the NH$_3$ (1,1) integrated intensity maps, we identify
856 dense gas clumps across the eleven clouds. Depending on the cloud observed, $40-100\%$ of the
clumps are aligned spatially with filaments identified in H$_2$ column density maps derived from
SED-fitting of dust continuum emission. A virial analysis reveals that 523 of the 835 clumps ($\sim63\%$)
with mass estimates are bound by gravity alone. We find no significant difference between the virial
parameter distributions for clumps aligned with the dust-continuum filaments and those unaligned
with filaments. In some clouds, however, hubs or ridges of dense gas with unusually high mass and
low virial parameters are located within a single filament or at the intersection of multiple filaments.
These hubs and ridges tend to host water maser emission, multiple 70$\mu$m-detected protostars,
and have masses and radii above an empirical threshold for forming massive stars.
