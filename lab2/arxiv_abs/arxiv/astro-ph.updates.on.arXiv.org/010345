Pre-main sequence stars are variable sources. In diskless stars this variability is mainly due
to the rotational modulation of dark photospheric spots and active regions, as in main sequence
stars even if associated with a stronger magnetic activity. Aims. We aim at analyzing the simultaneous
optical and X-ray variability in these stars to unveil how the activity in the photosphere is connected
with that in the corona, to identify the dominant surface magnetic activity, and to correlate our
results with stellar properties, such as rotation and mass. Methods. We analyzed the simultaneous
optical and X-ray variability in stars without inner disks (e.g., class III objects and stars with
transition disks) in NGC 2264 from observations obtained with Chandra/ACIS-I and CoRoT as part
of the Coordinated Synoptic Investigation of NGC 2264. We searched for those stars whose optical
and X-ray variability is correlated, anti-correlated, or not correlated by sampling their optical
and X-ray light curves in suitable time intervals and studying the correlation between the flux
observed in optical and in X-rays. We then studied how this classification is related with stellar
properties. Results. Starting from a sample of 74 class III/transition disk (TD) stars observed
with CoRoT and detected with Chandra with more than 60 counts, we selected 16 stars whose optical
and X-ray variability is anti-correlated, 11 correlated, and 17 where there is no correlation.
The remaining stars did not fall in any of these groups. We interpreted the anti-correlated optical
and X-ray variability as typical of spot-dominated sources, due to the rotational modulation of
photospheric spots spatially coincident to coronal active regions, and correlated variability
typical of faculae-dominated sources, where the brightening due to faculae is dominant over the
darkening due to spots. [Conclusions not shown in the pre-print]
