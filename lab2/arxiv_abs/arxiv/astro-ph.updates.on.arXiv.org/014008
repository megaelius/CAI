Gas detection around main sequence stars is becoming more common with around 20 systems showing
the presence of CO. However, more detections are needed, especially around later spectral type
stars to better understand the origin of this gas and refine our models. To do so, we carried out a survey
of 10 stars with predicted high likelihoods of secondary CO detection using ALMA in band 6. We looked
for continuum emission of mm-dust as well as gas emission (CO and CN transitions). The continuum
emission was detected in 9/10 systems for which we derived the discs' dust masses and geometrical
properties, providing the first mm-wave detection of the disc around HD 106906, the first mm-wave
radius for HD 114082, 117214, HD 15745, HD 191089 and the first radius at all for HD 121191. A crucial
finding of our paper is that we detect CO for the first time around the young 10-16 Myr old G1V star HD
129590, similar to our early Sun. The gas seems colocated with its planetesimal belt and its total
mass is likely between $3-20 \times 10^{-5}$ M$_\oplus$. This first gas detection around a G-type
main-sequence star raises questions as to whether gas may have been released in the Solar System
as well in its youth, which could potentially have affected planet formation. We also detected CO
gas around HD 121191 at a higher S/N than previously and find that the CO lies much closer-in than the
planetesimals in the system, which could be evidence for the previously suspected CO viscous spreading
owing to shielding preventing its photodissociation. Finally, we make estimates for the CO content
in planetesimals and the HCN/CO outgassing rate (from CN upper limits), which we find are below the
level seen in Solar System comets in some systems.
