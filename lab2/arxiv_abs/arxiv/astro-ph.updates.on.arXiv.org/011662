We examine the impact of black hole jet feedback on the properties of the low-redshift intergalactic
medium (IGM) in the Simba simulation, with a focus on the Ly$\alpha$ forest mean flux decrement $D_A$
and the inferred HI photo-ionisation rate $\Gamma_{HI}$. Without jet feedback, we confirm the
Photon Underproduction Crisis (PUC; Kollmeier et al. 2014) in which $\Gamma_{HI}$ at $z=0$ must
be increased by $\times 6$ over the Haardt & Madau (2012) value in order to match the observed $D_A$.
Turning on jet feedback lowers this discrepancy to $\sim\times 2.5$, and additionally using the
recent Faucher-Gigu\`ere 2019 background results in even better agreement, nearly solving the
PUC. The PUC becomes apparent at late epochs ($z \sim < 1$) where the jet and no-jet simulations diverge;
at higher redshifts Simba reproduces the observed $D_A$ with no adjustment, with or without jets.
The main impact of jet feedback is to lower the cosmic baryon fraction in the diffuse IGM from 39% to
16% at $z=0$, while increasing the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) baryon fraction from 30%
to 70%; the lowering of the diffuse IGM content directly translates into a lowering of $D_A$ by a similar
factor. Comparing to the older Mufasa simulation that employs different quenching feedback but
is otherwise similar to Simba, Mufasa matches $D_A$ less well than Simba, suggesting that low-redshift
measurements of $D_A$ and $\Gamma_{HI}$ could provide constraints on feedback mechanisms. Our
results suggest that widespread IGM heating at late times is a plausible solution to the PUC, and
that Simba's jet AGN feedback model, constrained to reproduce quenched massive galaxies, approximately
yields this required heating.
