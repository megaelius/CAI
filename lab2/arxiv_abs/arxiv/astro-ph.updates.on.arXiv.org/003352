We present the first spectroscopic measurement of multiple rest-frame optical emission lines
at $z>4$. During the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey, we observed the galaxy GOODSN-17940
with the Keck I/MOSFIRE spectrograph. The K-band spectrum of GOODSN-17940 includes significant
detections of the [OII]$\lambda\lambda 3726,3729$, [NeIII]$\lambda3869$, and H$\gamma$ emission
lines and a tentative detection of H$\delta$, indicating $z_{\rm{spec}}=4.4121$. GOODSN-17940
is an actively star-forming $z>4$ galaxy based on its K-band spectrum and broadband spectral energy
distribution. A significant excess relative to the surrounding continuum is present in the Spitzer/IRAC
channel 1 photometry of GOODSN-17940, due primarily to strong H$\alpha$ emission with a rest-frame
equivalent width of $\mbox{EW(H}\alpha)=1200$ \AA. Based on the assumption of $0.5 Z_{\odot}$
models and the Calzetti attenuation curve, GOODSN-17940 is characterized by $M_*=5.0^{+4.3}_{-0.2}\times
10^9 M_{\odot}$. The Balmer decrement inferred from H$\alpha$/H$\gamma$ is used to dust correct
the H$\alpha$ emission, yielding $\mbox{SFR(H}\alpha)=320^{+190}_{-140} M_{\odot}\mbox{
yr}^{-1}$. These $M_*$ and SFR values place GOODSN-17940 an order of magnitude in SFR above the $z\sim
4$ star-forming "main sequence." Finally, we use the observed ratio of [NeIII]/[OII] to estimate
the nebular oxygen abundance in GOODSN-17940, finding $\mbox{O/H}\sim 0.2 \mbox{ (O/H)}_{\odot}$.
Combining our new [NeIII]/[OII] measurement with those from stacked spectra at $z\sim 0, 2, \mbox{
and } 3$, we show that GOODSN-17940 represents an extension to $z>4$ of the evolution towards higher
[NeIII]/[OII] (i.e., lower $\mbox{O/H}$) at fixed stellar mass. It will be possible to perform
the measurements presented here out to $z\sim 10$ using the James Webb Space Telescope.
