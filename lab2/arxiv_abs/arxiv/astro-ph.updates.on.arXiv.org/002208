Exploring the ICM power spectrum can help us to probe the physics of galaxy clusters. Using high-resolution
3D plasma simulations, we study the statistics of the velocity field and its relation with the thermodynamic
perturbations. The normalization of the ICM spectrum (density, entropy, or pressure) is linearly
tied to the level of large-scale motions, which excite both gravity and sound waves due to stratification.
For low 3D Mach number M~0.25, gravity waves mainly drive entropy perturbations, traced by preferentially
tangential turbulence. For M>0.5, sound waves start to significantly contribute, passing
the leading role to compressive pressure fluctuations, associated with isotropic (or slightly
radial) turbulence. Density and temperature fluctuations are then characterized by the dominant
process: isobaric (low M), adiabatic (high M), or isothermal (strong conduction). Most clusters
reside in the intermediate regime, showing a mixture of gravity and sound waves, hence drifting
towards isotropic velocities. Remarkably, regardless of the regime, the variance of density perturbations
is comparable to the 1D Mach number. This linear relation allows to easily convert between gas motions
and ICM perturbations, which can be exploited by Chandra, XMM data and by the forthcoming Astro-H.
At intermediate and small scales (10-100 kpc), the turbulent velocities develop a Kolmogorov cascade.
The thermodynamic perturbations act as effective tracers of the velocity field, broadly consistent
with the Kolmogorov-Obukhov-Corrsin advection theory. Thermal conduction acts to damp the gas
fluctuations, washing out the filamentary structures and steepening the spectrum, while leaving
unaltered the velocity cascade. The ratio of the velocity and density spectrum thus inverts the
downtrend shown by the non-diffusive models, allowing to probe the presence of significant conductivity
in the ICM.
