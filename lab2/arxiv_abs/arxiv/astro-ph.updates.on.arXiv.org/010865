I compare the mass values obtained with data taken from the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI) radio
interferometer system and from the Planck satellite. The former of these uses a Bayesian analysis
pipeline that parameterises a cluster in terms of its physical quantities, and models the dark matter
\& baryonic components of a cluster using Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and generalised-NFW profiles
respectively. I also analyse simulated AMI data with input values based on PwS mass estimates. I
then compare three cluster models using AMI data for the 54 cluster sample. The two observational
models considered only model the gas content of the cluster. To compare the physical and observational
models I consider their posterior parameter estimates, including the calculation of a metric defined
between two probability distributions. The models' fit to the cluster data is evaluated by looking
at the Bayesian evidence values. Improvements to the physical modelling of galaxy clusters are
then considered, either by relaxing some of the assumptions underlying the physical model, or by
introducing a new profile for the dark matter component of clusters. The final part of the cluster
analysis work focuses on Bayesian analysis using a joint likelihood function of data from both AMI
and the Planck satellite simultaneously. Finally, a new Bayesian inference algorithm based on
nested sampling is presented. The algorithm, named the "geometric nested sampler", is an adaption
of the Metropolis-Hastings nested sampler and makes use of the geometrical interpretation of sets
of parameters to sample from their domains efficiently. The geometric nested sampler is tested
on several toy models as well as a model representing the emission of gravitational waves from binary
black hole mergers.
