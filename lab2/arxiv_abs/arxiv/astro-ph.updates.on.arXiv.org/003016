We present high angular resolution dust polarization and molecular line observations carried
out with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) toward the Class 0 protostar
Serpens SMM1. By complementing these observations with new polarization observations from the
Submillimeter Array (SMA) and archival data from the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave
Astronomy (CARMA) and the James Clerk Maxwell Telescopes (JCMT), we can compare the magnetic field
orientations at different spatial scales. We find major changes in the magnetic field orientation
between large (~0.1 pc) scales -- where the magnetic field is oriented E-W, perpendicular to the
major axis of the dusty filament where SMM1 is embedded -- and the intermediate and small scales probed
by CARMA (~1000 AU resolution), the SMA (~350 AU resolution), and ALMA (~140 AU resolution). The
ALMA maps reveal that the redshifted lobe of the bipolar outflow is shaping the magnetic field in
SMM1 on the southeast side of the source; however, on the northwestern side and elsewhere in the source,
low velocity shocks may be causing the observed chaotic magnetic field pattern. High-spatial-resolution
continuum and spectral-line observations also reveal a tight (~130 AU) protobinary system in SMM1-b,
the eastern component of which is launching an extremely high-velocity, one-sided jet visible
in both CO(2-1) and SiO(5-4); however, that jet does not appear to be shaping the magnetic field.
These observations show that with the sensitivity and resolution of ALMA, we can now begin to understand
the role that feedback (e.g., from protostellar outflows) plays in shaping the magnetic field in
very young, star-forming sources like SMM1.
