Using a suite of fully relativistic hydrodynamic simulations applied to main-sequence stars with
realistic internal density profiles, we examine full and partial tidal disruptions across a wide
range of black hole mass ($10^{5}\leq M_{\rm BH}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\leq 5\times 10^{7}$) and
stellar mass ($0.3 \leq M_{\star} /\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\leq 3$) as larger $M_{\rm BH}$ leads to
stronger relativistic effects. For fixed $M_{\star}$, as $M_{\rm BH}$ increases, the ratio of
the maximum pericenter distance yielding full disruptions ($\mathcal{R}_{\rm t}$) to its Newtonian
prediction rises rapidly, becoming triple the Newtonian value for $M_{\rm BH} = 5\times10^{7}~{\rm
M}_\odot$, while the ratio of the energy width of the stellar debris for full disruptions to the Newtonian
prediction decreases steeply, resulting in a factor of two correction at $M_{\rm BH} = 5 \times 10^7~{\rm
M}_\odot$. We find that for partial disruptions, the fractional remnant mass for a given ratio of
the pericenter to $\mathcal{R}_{\rm t}$ is higher for larger $M_{\rm BH}$. These results have several
implications. As $M_{\rm BH}$ increases above $\sim 10^7~{\rm M}_\odot$, the cross section for
complete disruptions is suppressed by competition with direct capture. However, the cross section
ratio for partial to complete disruptions depends only weakly on $M_{\rm BH}$. The relativistic
correction to the debris energy width delays the time of peak mass-return rate and diminishes the
magnitude of the peak return rate. For $M_{\rm BH} \gtrsim 10^7~{\rm M}_\odot$, the $M_{\rm BH}$-dependence
of the full disruption cross section and the peak mass-return rate and time is influenced more by
relativistic effects than by Newtonian dynamics.
