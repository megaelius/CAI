During the rising phase of Solar Cycle 24 tremendous activity occurred on the Sun with fast and compact
emergence of magnetic flux leading to bursts of flares (C to M and even X-class). We investigate the
violent events occurring in the cluster of two active regions (ARs), NOAA numbers 11121 and 11123,
observed in November 2010 with instruments onboard the {\it Solar Dynamics Observatory} and from
Earth. Within one day the total magnetic flux increased by $70\%$ with the emergence of new groups
of bipoles in AR 11123. From all the events on 11 November, we study, in particular, the ones starting
at around 07:16 UT in GOES soft X-ray data and the brightenings preceding them. A magnetic-field
topological analysis indicates the presence of null points, associated separatrices and quasi-separatrix
layers (QSLs) where magnetic reconnection is prone to occur. The presence of null points is confirmed
by a linear and a non-linear force-free magnetic-field model. Their locations and general characteristics
are similar in both modelling approaches, which supports their robustness. However, in order to
explain the full extension of the analysed event brightenings, which are not restricted to the photospheric
traces of the null separatrices, we compute the locations of QSLs. Based on this more complete topological
analysis, we propose a scenario to explain the origin of a low-energy event preceding a filament
eruption, which is accompanied by a two-ribbon flare, and a consecutive confined flare in AR 11123.
The results of our topology computation can also explain the locations of flare ribbons in two other
events, one preceding and one following the ones at 07:16 UT. Finally, this study provides further
examples where flare-ribbon locations can be explained when compared to QSLs and only, partially,
when using separatrices.
