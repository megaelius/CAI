In nuclei of starburst galaxies, the combination of an enhanced rate of supernova explosions and
a high gas density suggests that cosmic rays can be efficiently produced, and that most of them lose
their energy before escaping these regions, resulting in a large flux of secondary products, including
neutrinos. Although the flux inferred from an individual starburst region is expected to be well
below the sensitivity of current neutrino telescopes, such sources may provide a substantial contribution
to the diffuse neutrino flux measured by IceCube. Here we compute the gamma-ray and neutrino flux
due to starburst galaxies based on a physical model of cosmic ray transport in a starburst nucleus,
and accounting for the redshift evolution of the number density of starburst sources as inferred
from recent measurements of the star formation rate. The model accounts for gamma-ray absorption
both inside the sources and in the intergalactic medium. The latter process is responsible for electromagnetic
cascades, which also contribute to the diffuse gamma-ray background at lower energies. The conditions
for acceleration of cosmic ray protons up to energies exceeding $ \sim 10 \, \rm PeV$ in starburst
regions, necessary for the production of PeV neutrinos, are investigated in a critical way. We show
that starburst nuclei can account for the diffuse neutrino flux above $\sim 200 \, \rm TeV$, thereby
producing $\lesssim 40 \%$ of the extragalactic diffuse gamma-ray background. Below $\sim 200
\, \rm TeV$, the flux from starburst appears to be somewhat lower than the observed one, where both
the Galactic contribution and the flux of atmospheric neutrinos may account for the difference.
