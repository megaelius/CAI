Stars rarely form in isolation. Nearly half of the stars in the Milky Way have a companion, and this
fraction increases in star-forming regions. However, why some dense cores and filaments form bound
pairs while others form single stars remains unclear. We present a set of three-dimensional, gravo-magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of turbulent star-forming clouds, aimed at understanding the formation and evolution
of multiple-star systems formed through large scale (>~$10^3$ AU) turbulent fragmentation. We
investigate three global magnetic field strengths, with global mass-to-flux ratios of $\mu_\phi$=2,
8, and 32. The initial separations of protostars in multiples depends on the global magnetic field
strength, with stronger magnetic fields (e.g., $\mu_\phi$=2) suppressing fragmentation on smaller
scales. The overall multiplicity fraction (MF) is between 0.4-0.6 for our strong and intermediate
magnetic field strengths, which is in agreement with observations. The weak field case has a lower
fraction. The MF is relatively constant throughout the simulations, even though stellar densities
increase as collapse continues. While the MF rarely exceeds 60% in all three simulations, over 80%
of all protostars are part of a binary system at some point. We additionally find that the distribution
of binary spin mis-alignment angles is consistent with a randomized distribution. In all three
simulations, several binaries originate with wide separations and dynamically evolve to <~ $10^2$
AU separations. We show that a simple model of mass accretion and dynamical friction with the gas
can explain this orbital evolution.
