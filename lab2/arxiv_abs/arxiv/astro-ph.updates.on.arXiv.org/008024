Several planets have been found that orbit their host star on retrograde orbits (spin-orbit angle
{\phi} > 90{\deg}). Currently, the largest measured projected angle between the orbital angular
momentum axis of a planet and the rotation axis of its host star has been found for HAT-P-14b to be $\approx$
171{\deg}. One possible mechanism for the formation of such misalignments is through long-term
interactions between the planet and other planetary or stellar companions. However, with this
process, it has been found to be difficult to achieve retrogradely orbiting planets, especially
planets that almost exactly counter-orbit their host star ({\phi} $\approx$ 180{\deg}) such as
HAT-P-14b. By contrast, orbital misalignment can be produced efficiently by perturbations of
planetary systems that are passed by stars. Here we demonstrate that not only retrograde fly-bys,
but surprisingly, even prograde fly-bys can induce retrograde orbits. Our simulations show that
depending on the mass ratio of the involved stars, there are significant ranges of planetary pre-encounter
parameters for which counter-orbiting planets are the natural consequence. We find that the highest
probability to produce counter-orbiting planets ($\approx$ 20%) is achieved with close prograde,
coplanar fly-bys of an equal-mass perturber with a pericentre distance of one-third of the initial
orbital radius of the planet. For fly-bys where the pericentre distance equals the initial orbital
radius of the planet, we still find a probability to produce retrograde planets of $\approx$ 10%
for high-mass perturbers on inclined (60{\deg} < i < 120{\deg}) orbits. As usually more distant
fly-bys are more common in star clusters, this means that inclined fly-bys probably lead to more
retrograde planets than those with inclinations < 60{\deg}. (...)
