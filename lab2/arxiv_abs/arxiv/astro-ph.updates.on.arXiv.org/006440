Semi-numerical models of the reionization of neutral hydrogen (HI) based on the excursion set (ES)
approach are known to violate photon number conservation at the few per cent level. In this work,
we highlight a more severe, previously unrecognized shortcoming of ES models: the large-scale
21 cm power spectrum (equivalently, HI bias b_HI) is a relatively strong function of the spatial
resolution used to generate ES ionization maps. We trace this problem to the fact that photon non-conservation
in these models arises from a resolution-dependent mixture of spatially resolved, photon non-conserving
bubbles, and partially ionized grid cells which are perfectly photon-conserving by construction.
We argue that this inevitably leads to a resolution-dependence of b_HI, with the correct, converged
value only emerging at very coarse resolution. Quantitatively, we find that b_HI can be non-converged
by as much as ~20-25% in conservative ES implementations with grid sizes Delta x=5-10 cMpc/h, even
when photon non-conservation is as small as ~3-4%. Thus, although numerically efficient, ES ionization
maps coarse enough to produce a converged HI bias would wash out all topological features of the ionization
field at scales k>~0.05 h/cMpc. We therefore present a new, explicitly photon conserving (PC) semi-numerical
algorithm which distributes photons isotropically around sources while also accounting for anisotropic
overlaps between nearby bubbles. Our PC algorithm predicts a resolution-independent value of
b_HI consistent with the result of low-resolution ES maps, thus serving as a useful compromise between
standard ES implementations and more expensive radiative transfer simulations.
