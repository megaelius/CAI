Outflows in quasars during the early epochs of galaxy evolution are an important part of the feedback
mechanisms potentially affecting the evolution of the host galaxy. However, systematic observations
of outflows are only now becoming possible with the advent of sensitive mm telescopes. In this study
we use spectral stacking methods to search for faint high velocity outflow signal in a sample of [C
II] detected, z ~ 6 quasars. We search for broad emission line signatures from high-velocity outflows
for a sample of 26 z ~ 6 quasars observed with ALMA, with a detection of the [C II] line. The observed
emission lines of the sources are dominated by the host galaxy, and outflow emission is not detected
for the individual sources. We use a spectral line stacking analysis developed for interferometric
data to search for outflow emission. We stack both extracted spectra and the full spectral cubes.
We also investigate the possibility that only a sub-set of our sample contributes to the stacked
outflow emission. We find only a tentative detection of a broad emission line component in the stacked
spectra. When taking a region of about 2 arcsec around the source central position of the stacked
cubes, the stacked line shows an excess emission due to a broad component of 1.1-1.5 sigma, but the
significance drops to 0.4-0.7 sigma when stacking the extracted spectra from a smaller region.
The broad component can be characterised by a line width of full width half max FWHM > 700 km/s. Furthermore,
we find a sub-sample of 12 sources the stack of which maximises the broad component emission. The
stack of this sub-sample shows an excess emission due to a broad component of 1.2-2.5 sigma. The stacked
line of these sources has a broad component of FWHM > 775 km/s. Deeper ALMA observations are necessary
to confirm the presence of a broad component in the individual spectra.
