We use data from the first-year (Y1) observations of the DES collaboration to measure the galaxy
angular power spectrum (APS), and search for its BAO feature using a template-fitting method. We
test our methodology in a sample of 1800 DES Y1-like mock catalogs. The APS is measured with the pseudo-$C_\ell$
method, using pixelized maps constructed from the mock catalogs and the DES mask. The covariance
matrix of the $C_\ell$'s in these tests are also obtained from the mock catalogs. We use templates
to model the measured spectra and estimate template parameters firstly from the $C_\ell$'s of the
mocks using two different methods, a maximum likelihood estimator and a MCMC, finding consistent
results with a good reduced $\chi^2$. Robustness tests are performed to estimate the impact of different
choices of settings used in our analysis. After these tests on mocks, we apply our method to a galaxy
sample constructed from DES Y1 data specifically for LSS studies. This catalog comprises galaxies
within an effective area of 1318 deg$^2$ and $0.6<z<1.0$. We fit the observed spectra with our optimized
templates, considering models with and without BAO features. We find that the DES Y1 data favors
a model with BAO at the $2.6\,\sigma$ C.L. with a best-fit shift parameter of $\alpha=1.023\pm 0.047$.
However, the goodness-of-fit is somewhat poor, with $\chi^2/$(dof) = 1.49. We identify a possible
cause of this issue and show that using a theoretical covariance matrix obtained from $C_\ell$'s
that are better adjusted to data results in an improved value of $\chi^2/$(dof) = 1.36 which is similar
to the value obtained with the real-space analysis. Our results correspond to a distance measurement
of $D_A(z_{\rm eff} = 0.81)/r_d = 10.65 \pm 0.49$, consistent with the main DES BAO findings. This
is a companion paper to the main DES BAO article showing the details of the harmonic space analysis.
