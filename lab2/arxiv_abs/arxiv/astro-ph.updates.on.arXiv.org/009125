We report on the first ALMA observation of the CO(3$-$2) and rest-frame ~340 GHz continuum emission
in PDS 456, which is the most luminous, radio-quiet QSO in the local Universe ($z$~0.18), with a bolometric
luminosity $L_{\rm Bol}\sim10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$. ALMA angular resolution allowed us to map scales
as small as ~700 pc. The molecular gas reservoir, traced by the core of the very bright CO(3$-$2) emission
line, is distributed in a compact rotating disk, with size of ~1.3 kpc, seen close to face-on ($i$~25
deg). Fast CO(3$-$2) emission in the velocity range $v\in[-1000,+500]$ km s$^{-1}$ is also present.
Specifically, we detect several blue-shifted clumps out to ~5 kpc from the nucleus, in addition
to a compact ($R\lesssim1.2$ kpc), broad emission component. These components reveal a galaxy-wide
molecular outflow, with a total mass $M_{\rm mol}^{\rm out}\sim2.5\times10^8$ $M_{\odot}$ and
a mass outflow rate $\dot{M}_{\rm mol}\sim290$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The corresponding depletion
time is ~8 Myr, shorter than the rate at which the molecular gas is converted into stars, indicating
that the detected outflow is potentially able to quench star-formation in the host. The momentum
flux of the molecular outflow normalised to the radiative momentum output (i.e. $L_{\rm Bol}/c$)
is $\lesssim1$, comparable to that of the X-ray ultra-fast outflow (UFO) detected in PDS 456. This
is at odds with the expectations for an energy-conserving expansion suggested for most of the large-scale
outflows detected in low-luminosity AGN so far. We suggest three possible scenarios that may explain
this observation: (i) in very luminous AGN such as our target the molecular gas phase is tracing only
a fraction of the total outflowing mass; (ii) a small coupling between the shocked gas by the UFO and
the host-galaxy ISM (iii) AGN radiation pressure may play an important role in driving the outflow.
