(Abridged) We describe a new algorithm for solving the coupled frequency-integrated transfer
equation and the equations of magnetohydrodynamics when the light-crossing time is only marginally
shorter than dynamical timescales. The transfer equation is solved in the mixed frame, including
velocity dependent source terms accurate to O(v/c). An operator split approach is used to compute
the specific intensity along discrete rays, with upwind monotonic interpolation used along each
ray to update the transport terms, and implicit methods used to compute the scattering and absorption
source terms. Conservative differencing is used for the transport terms, which ensures the specific
intensity (as well as energy and momentum) are conserved along each ray to round-off error. The use
of implicit methods for the source terms ensures the method is stable even if the source terms are
very stiff. To couple the solution of the transfer equation to the MHD algorithms in the Athena code,
we perform direct quadrature of the specific intensity over angles to compute the energy and momentum
source terms. We present the results of a variety of tests of the method, such as calculating the structure
of a non-LTE atmosphere, an advective diffusion test, linear wave convergence tests, and the well-known
shadow test. We use new semi-analytic solutions for radiation modified shocks to demonstrate the
ability of our algorithm to capture the effects of an anisotropic radiation field accurately. Since
the method uses explicit differencing of the spatial operators, it shows excellent weak scaling
on parallel computers. The method is ideally suited for problems in which characteristic velocities
are non-relativistic, but still within a few percent or more of the speed of light. The method is an
intermediate step towards algorithms for fully relativistic flows.
