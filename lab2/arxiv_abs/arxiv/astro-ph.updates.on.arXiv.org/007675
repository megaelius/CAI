We present a multi-wavelength analysis of the core of the massive galaxy cluster MACS\,J0417.5-1154
($z = 0.441$; MACS\;J0417). Our analysis takes advantage of VLT/MUSE observations which allow
the spectroscopic confirmation of three strongly-lensed systems. One of these, nick-named \emph{The
Doughnut}, consists of three complete images of a complex ring galaxy at $z = 0.8718$ and a fourth,
partial and radial image close to the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) only discernible thanks to
its strong [OII] line emission. The best-fit mass model (rms of 0.38\arcsec) yields a two-dimensional
enclosed mass of $M({\rm R < 200\,kpc}) = (1.77\pm0.03)\times10^{14}\,\msun$ and almost perfect
alignment between the peaks of the BCG light and the dark matter of ($0.5\pm0.5$)\arcsec . Our finding
that a significant misalignment results when the radial image of \emph{The Doughnut} is omitted
serves as an important caveat for studies of BCG-dark matter offsets in galaxy clusters. Using \emph{Chandra}
data to map the intra-cluster gas, we observe an offset between the gas and dark-matter peaks of ($1.7\pm0.5$)\arcsec,
and excellent alignment of the X-ray peak with the location of optical emission line associated
with the BCG. We interpret all observational evidence in the framework of on-going merger activity,
noting specifically that the coincidence between the gas peak and the peak of blue light from the
BCG may be evidence of dense, cold gas leading to direct star formation. We use the surface area $\sigma_{\mu}$
above a given magnification factor $\mu$ as a metric to estimate the lensing power of MACS\,J0417.
We obtain $\sigma(\mu > 3) = 0.22$\,arcmin$^2$ confirming MACS\,J0417 as an efficient gravitational
lens. Finally, we discuss the differences between our mass model and Mahler et al. (2018).
