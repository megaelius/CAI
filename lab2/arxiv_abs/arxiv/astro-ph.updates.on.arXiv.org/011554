A network of three or more gravitational wave detectors simultaneously taking data is required
to generate a well-localized sky map for gravitational wave sources, such as GW170817. Local seismic
disturbances often cause the LIGO and Virgo detectors to lose light resonance in one or more of their
component optic cavities, and the affected detector is unable to take data until resonance is recovered.
In this paper, we use machine learning techniques to gain insight into the predictive behavior of
the LIGO detector optic cavities during the second LIGO-Virgo observing run. We identify a minimal
set of optic cavity control signals and data features which capture interferometer behavior leading
to a loss of light resonance, or lockloss. We use these channels to accurately distinguish between
lockloss events and quiet interferometer operating times via both supervised and unsupervised
machine learning methods. This analysis yields new insights into how components of the LIGO detectors
contribute to lockloss events, which could inform detector commissioning efforts to mitigate
the associated loss of uptime. Particularly, we find that the state of the component optical cavities
is a better predictor of loss of lock than ground motion trends. We report prediction accuracies
of 98% for times just prior to lock loss, and 90% for times up to 30 seconds prior to lockloss, which
shows promise for this method to be applied in near-real time to trigger preventative detector state
changes. This method can be extended to target other auxiliary subsystems or times of interest,
such as transient noise or loss in detector sensitivity. Application of these techniques during
the third LIGO-Virgo observing run and beyond would maximize the potential of the global detector
network for multi-messenger astronomy with gravitational waves.
