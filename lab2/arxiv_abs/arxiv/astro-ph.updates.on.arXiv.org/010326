We investigate the binarity properties in field stars using more than 50\,000 main-sequence stars
with stellar mass from 0.4 to 0.85\,$M_\odot$ observed by LAMOST and {\emph Gaia} in the solar neighborhood.
By adopting a power-law shape of the mass-ratio distribution with power index of $\gamma$, we conduct
a hierarchical Bayesian model to derive the binary fraction ($f_{b}$) and $\gamma$ for stellar
populations with different metallicities and primary masses ($m_1$). We find that $f_b$ is tightly
anti-correlated with $\gamma$, i.e. the populations with smaller binary fraction contains more
binaries with larger mass-ratio and vice versa.The high-$\gamma$ populations with $\gamma>1.2$
have lower stellar mass and higher metallicity, while the low-$\gamma$ populations with $\gamma<1.2$
have larger mass or lower metallicity. The $f_b$ of the high-$\gamma$ group is anti-correlated
with [Fe/H] but flat with $m_1$.Meanwhile, the $f_b$ of the low-$\gamma$ group displays clear correlation
with $m_1$ but quite flat with [Fe/H]. The substantial differences are likely due to the dynamical
processing when the binaries were in the embedded star clusters in their early days. The dynamical
processing tends to destroy binaries with smaller primary mass, smaller mass-ratio, and wider
separation. Consequently, the high-$\gamma$ group containing smaller $m_1$ is more effectively
influenced and hence contains less binaries, many of which have larger mass-ratio and shorter period.
However, the low-$\gamma$ group is less affected by the dynamical processing due to their larger
$m_1$. These are evident that the dynamical processing does effectively work and significantly
reshape the present-day binary properties of field stars.
