Galaxies in the reionization-era have been shown to have prominent [OIII]+H$\beta$ emission.
Little is known about the gas conditions and radiation field of this population, making it challenging
to interpret the spectra emerging at $z\gtrsim6$. Motivated by this shortcoming, we have initiated
a large MMT spectroscopic survey identifying rest-frame optical emission lines in 227 intense
[OIII] emitting galaxies at $1.3<z<2.4$. This sample complements the MOSDEF and KBSS surveys,
extending to much lower stellar masses ($10^7-10^8 M_\odot$) and larger specific star formation
rates ($5-300$ Gyr$^{-1}$), providing a window on galaxies directly following a burst or recent
upturn in star formation. The hydrogen ionizing production efficiency ($\xi_{\rm{ion}}$) is
found to increase with the [OIII] EW, in a manner similar to that found in local galaxies by Chevallard
et al. (2018). We describe how this relationship helps explain the anomalous success rate in identifying
Ly$\alpha$ emission in $z\gtrsim7$ galaxies with strong [OIII]+H$\beta$ emission. We probe the
impact of the intense radiation field on the ISM using O32 and Ne3O2, two ionization-sensitive indices.
Both are found to scale with the [OIII] EW, revealing extreme ionization conditions not commonly
seen in older and more massive galaxies. In the most intense line emitters, the indices have very
large average values (O32 $=9.1$, Ne3O2 $=0.5$) that have been shown to be linked to ionizing photon
escape. We discuss implications for the nature of galaxies most likely to have O32 values associated
with significant LyC escape. Finally we consider the optimal strategy for JWST spectroscopic investigations
of galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$ where the strongest rest-frame optical lines are no longer visible
with NIRSpec.
