We report the first systematic study of the submillimeter water vapor rotational emission lines
in infrared (IR) galaxies based on the Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) data of {\it Herschel}
SPIRE. Among the 176 galaxies with publicly available FTS data, 45 have at least one H$_2$O emission
line detected. The H$_2$O line luminosities range from $\sim 1 \times 10^5$ L$_{\odot}$ to $\sim
5 \times 10^7$ L$_{\odot}$ while the total IR luminosities (L$_\mathrm{IR}$) have a similar spread
($\sim$1-300 $\times 10^{10}$ L$_{\odot}$). In addition, emission lines of H$_2$O$^+$ and H$_2^{18}$O
are also detected. H$_2$O is found, for most galaxies, to be the strongest molecular emitter after
CO in FTS spectra. The luminosity of the five most important H$_2$O lines is near-linearly correlated
with L$_\mathrm{IR}$ no matter strong AGN signature is present or not. However, the luminosity
of H$_2$O(2$_{11}-2_{02}$) and H$_2$O(2$_{20}-2_{11}$) appears to increase slightly faster
than linear with L$_\mathrm{IR}$. Although the slope turns out to be slightly steeper when z$\sim$2-4
ULIRGs are included, the correlation is still closely linear. We find that L$_\mathrm{H_2O}/\mathrm{L}_\mathrm{IR}$
decreases with increasing f$_{25}$/f$_{60}$, but see no dependence on f$_{60}$/f$_{100}$, possibly
indicating that very warm dust contributes little to the excitation of the submillimeter H$_2$O
lines. The average spectral line energy distribution (SLED) of entire sample is consistent with
individual SLEDs and the IR pumping plus collisional excitation model, showing that the strongest
lines are H$_2$O(2$_{02}-1_{11}$) and H$_2$O(3$_{21}-3_{12}$).
