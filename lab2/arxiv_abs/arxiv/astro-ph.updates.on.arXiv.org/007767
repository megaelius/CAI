We investigate generalized Einstein-Aether theories that are compatible with the Planck Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) temperature anisotropy, polarisation, and lensing data. For a given
dark energy equation of state, $w_{\rm de}$, we formulate a designer approach and we investigate
their impact on the CMB temperature anisotropy and matter power spectra. We use the Equation of State
approach to parametrize the perturbations and find that this approach is particularly useful in
identifying the most suitable and numerically efficient parameters to explore in a Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. We find the data constrains models with $w_{\rm de} = -1$ to be compatible
with $\Lambda$CDM. For $w_{\rm de} \not= -1$ models, which avoid the gravitational waves constraint
through the entropy perturbation, we constrain $w_{\rm de}$ to be $w_{\rm de } = -1.06^{+0.08}_{-0.03}$
(CMB) and $w_{\rm de } =-1.04^{+0.05}_{-0.02}$ (CMB+Lensing) at $68\%$C.L., and find that these
models can be different from $\Lambda$CDM and still be compatible with the data. We also find that
these models can ameliorate some anomalies in $\Lambda$CDM when confronted with data, such as the
low-$\ell$ and high-$k$ power in the CMB temperature anisotropy and matter power spectra respectively,
but not simultaneously. We also investigate the anomalous lensing amplitude, quantified by $A_{\rm
lens}$, and find that that for $w_{\rm de} = -1$ models, $A_{\rm lens} = 1.15^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$ (CMB)
and $A_{\rm lens} = 1.12\pm0.05$ (CMB+Lensing) at $68\%$C.L. $\sim$ 2$\sigma$ larger than expected,
similar to previous analyses of $\Lambda$CDM.
