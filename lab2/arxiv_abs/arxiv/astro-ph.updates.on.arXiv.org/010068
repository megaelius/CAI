The relation between magnetic activity and rotation in late-type stars provides fundamental information
on stellar dynamos and angular momentum evolution. Rotation/activity studies found in the literature
suffer from inhomogeneity in the measure of activity indexes and rotation periods. We overcome
this limitation with a study of the X-ray emitting late-type main-sequence stars observed by XMM-Newton
and Kepler. We measure rotation periods from photometric variability in Kepler light curves. As
activity indicators, we adopt the X-ray luminosity, the number frequency of white-light flares,
the amplitude of the rotational photometric modulation, and the standard deviation in the Kepler
light curves. The search for X-ray flares in the light curves provided by the EXTraS (Exploring the
X-ray Transient and variable Sky) FP-7 project allows us to identify simultaneous X-ray and white-light
flares. A careful selection of the X-ray sources in the Kepler field yields 102 main-sequence stars
with spectral types from A to M. We find rotation periods for 74 X-ray emitting main-sequence stars,
22 of which without period reported in the previous literature. In the X-ray activity/rotation
relation, we see evidence for the traditional distinction of a saturated and a correlated part,
the latter presenting a continuous decrease in activity towards slower rotators. For the optical
activity indicators the transition is abrupt and located at a period of ~ 10 d but it can be probed only
marginally with this sample which is biased towards fast rotators due to the X-ray selection. We
observe 7 bona-fide X-ray flares with evidence for a white-light counterpart in simultaneous Kepler
data. We derive an X-ray flare frequency of ~ 0.15 d^{-1} , consistent with the optical flare frequency
obtained from the much longer Kepler time-series.
