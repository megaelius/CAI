The Cassini/Composite InfraRed Spectrometer (CIRS) instrument has been observing the middle
atmosphere of Titan over almost half a Saturnian year. We used the CIRS dataset processed through
the up-to-date calibration pipeline to characterize seasonal changes of temperature and abundance
profiles in the middle atmosphere of Titan, from mid-northern winter to early northern summer all
around the satellite. We used limb spectra from 590 to 1500 cm$^{-1}$ at 0.5-cm$^{-1}$ spectral
resolution, which allows us to probe different altitudes. We averaged the limb spectra recorded
during each flyby on a fixed altitude grid to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. These thermal
infrared data were analyzed by means of a radiative transfer code coupled with an inversion algorithm,
in order to retrieve vertical temperature and abundance profiles. These profiles cover an altitude
range of approximately 100 to 600 km, at 10- or 40-km vertical resolution (depending on the observation).
Strong changes in temperature and composition occur in both polar regions where a vortex is in place
during the winter. At this season, we observe a global enrichment in photochemical compounds in
the mesosphere and stratosphere and a hot stratopause located around 0.01 mbar, both linked to downwelling
in a pole-to-pole circulation cell. After the northern spring equinox, between December 2009 and
April 2010, a stronger enhancement of photochemical compounds occurred at the north pole above
the 0.01-mbar region, likely due to combined photochemical and dynamical effects. During the southern
autumn in 2015, above the South pole, we also observed a strong enrichment in photochemical compounds
that contributed to the cooling of the stratosphere above 0.2 mbar. Close to the northern spring
equinox, in December 2009, the thermal profile at 74{\deg}N exhibits an oscillation that we interpret
in terms of an inertia-gravity wave.
