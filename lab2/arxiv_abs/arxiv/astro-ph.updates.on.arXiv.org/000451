We measure the luminosity and color dependence and the redshift evolution of galaxy clustering
in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Ninth Data Release.
We focus on the projected two-point correlation function (2PCF) of subsets of its CMASS sample,
which includes about 260,000 galaxies over ~3,300 sq. deg in the redshift range 0.43<z<0.7.
To minimize the selection effect on galaxy clustering, we construct well-defined luminosity and
color subsamples by carefully accounting for the CMASS galaxy selection cuts. The 2PCF of the whole
CMASS sample, if approximated by a power-law, has a correlation length of r_0=7.93\pm0.06Mpc/h
and an index of \gamma=1.85\pm0.01. Clear dependences on galaxy luminosity and color are found
for the projected 2PCF in all redshift bins, with more luminous and redder galaxies generally exhibiting
stronger clustering and steeper 2PCF. The color dependence is also clearly seen for galaxies within
the red sequence, consistent with the behavior of SDSS-II main sample galaxies at lower redshifts.
At a given luminosity (k+e corrected), no significant evolution of the projected 2PCFs with redshift
is detected for red sequence galaxies. We also construct galaxy samples of fixed number density
at different redshifts, using redshift-dependent magnitude thresholds. The clustering of these
galaxies in the CMASS redshift range is found to be consistent with that predicted by passive evolution.
Our measurements of the luminosity and color dependence and redshift evolution of galaxy clustering
will allow for detailed modeling of the relation between galaxies and dark matter halos and new constraints
on galaxy formation and evolution.
