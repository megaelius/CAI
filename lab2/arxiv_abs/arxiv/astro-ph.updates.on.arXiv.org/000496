Previous analytic and numerical calculations suggest that, at each instant, the emission from
a precessing black hole binary closely resembles the emission from a nonprecessing analog. In this
paper we quantitatively explore the validity and limitations of that correspondence, extracting
the radiation from a large collection of roughly two hundred generic black hole binary merger simulations
both in the simulation frame and in a corotating frame that tracks precession. To a first approximation,
the corotating-frame waveforms resemble nonprecessing analogs, based on similarity over a band-limited
frequency interval defined using a fiducial detector (here, advanced LIGO) and the source's total
mass $M$. By restricting attention to masses $M\in 200, 2500 M_\odot$, we insure our comparisons
are sensitive only to our simulated late-time inspiral, merger, and ringdown signals. In this mass
region, every one of our precessing simulations can be fit by some physically similar member of the
\texttt{IMRPhenomB} phenomenological waveform family to better than 95%; most fit significantly
better. The best-fit parameters at low and high mass correspond to natural physical limits: the
pre-merger orbit and post-merger perturbed black hole. Our results suggest that physically-motivated
synthetic signals can be derived by viewing radiation from suitable nonprecessing binaries in
a suitable nonintertial reference frame. While a good first approximation, precessing systems
have degrees of freedom (i.e., the transverse spins) which a nonprecessing simulation cannot reproduce.
We quantify the extent to which these missing degrees of freedom limit the utility of synthetic precessing
signals for detection and parameter estimation.
