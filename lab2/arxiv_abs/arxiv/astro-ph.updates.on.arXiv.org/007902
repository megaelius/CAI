Despite being hard to measure, GRB prompt $\gamma$-ray emission polarization is a valuable probe
of the dominant emission mechanism and the outflow's composition and angular structure. During
the prompt emission the outflow is ultra-relativistic with Lorentz factors $\Gamma\gg1$. We describe
in detail the linear polarization properties of various emission mechanisms: synchrotron radiation
from different magnetic field structures (ordered: toroidal $B_{\rm tor}$ or radial $B_\parallel$,
and random: normal to the radial direction $B_\perp$), Compton drag, and photospheric emission.
We calculate the polarization for different GRB jet angular structures (e.g. top-hat, Gaussian,
power-law) and viewing angles $\theta_{\rm obs}$. Synchrotron with $B_\perp$ can produce large
polarizations, up to $25\%\lesssim\Pi\lesssim45\%$, for a top-hat jet but only for lines of sight
just outside the jet's sharp edge. The same also holds for Compton drag, albeit with a slightly higher
overall $\Pi$. Moreover, we demonstrate how $\Gamma$-variations during the GRB or smoother jet
edges would significantly reduce $\Pi$. We construct a semi-analytic model for non-dissipative
photospheric emission from structured jets. Such emission can produce up to $\Pi\lesssim15\%$
with reasonably high fluences, but this requires steep gradients in $\Gamma(\theta)$. A polarization
of $50\%\lesssim\Pi\lesssim65\%$ can robustly be produced only by synchrotron emission from
a transverse magnetic field ordered on angles $\gtrsim\!1/\Gamma$ around our line of sight (like
a global toroidal field). Therefore, such a model would be strongly favored even by a single secure
measurement within this range. We find that such a model would also be favored if $\Pi\gtrsim20\%$
is measured in most GRBs within a large enough sample, by deriving the polarization distribution
for our different emission and jet models.
