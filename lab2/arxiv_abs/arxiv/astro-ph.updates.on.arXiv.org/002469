Electron acceleration to non-thermal energies is known to occur in low Mach number (M<5) shocks
in galaxy clusters and solar flares, but the electron acceleration mechanism remains poorly understood.
Using two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations, we showed in Paper I that
electrons are efficiently accelerated in low Mach number (M=3) quasi-perpendicular shocks via
a Fermi-like process. The electrons bounce between the upstream region and the shock front, with
each reflection at the shock resulting in energy gain via shock drift acceleration. The upstream
scattering is provided by oblique magnetic waves, that are self-generated by the electrons escaping
ahead of the shock. In the present work, we employ additional 2D PIC simulations to address the nature
of the upstream oblique waves. We find that the waves are generated by the shock-reflected electrons
via the firehose instability, which is driven by an anisotropy in the electron velocity distribution.
We systematically explore how the efficiency of wave generation and of electron acceleration depend
on the magnetic field obliquity, the flow magnetization (or equivalently, the plasma beta), and
the upstream electron temperature. We find that the mechanism works for shocks with high plasma
beta (>20) at nearly all magnetic field obliquities, and for electron temperatures in the range
relevant for galaxy clusters. Our findings offer a natural solution to the conflict between the
bright radio synchrotron emission observed from the outskirts of galaxy clusters and the low electron
acceleration efficiency usually expected in low Mach number shocks.
