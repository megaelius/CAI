We have investigated a number of factors that can have significant impacts on the classification
performance of $\gamma$-ray sources detected by Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) with machine
learning techniques. We show that a framework of automatic feature selection can construct a simple
model with a small set of features which yields better performance over previous results. Secondly,
because of the small sample size of the training/test sets of certain classes in $\gamma$-ray, nested
re-sampling and cross-validations are suggested for quantifying the statistical fluctuations
of the quoted accuracy. We have also constructed a test set by cross-matching the identified active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) and the pulsars (PSRs) in the Fermi LAT eight-year point source catalog (4FGL)
with those unidentified sources in the previous 3$^{\rm rd}$ Fermi LAT Source Catalog (3FGL). Using
this cross-matched set, we show that some features used for building classification model with
the identified source can suffer from the problem of covariate shift, which can be a result of various
observational effects. This can possibly hamper the actual performance when one applies such model
in classifying unidentified sources. Using our framework, both AGN/PSR and young pulsar (YNG)/millisecond
pulsar (MSP) classifiers are automatically updated with the new features and the enlarged training
samples in 4FGL catalog incorporated. Using a two-layer model with these updated classifiers,
we have selected 20 promising MSP candidates with confidence scores $>98\%$ from the unidentified
sources in 4FGL catalog which can provide inputs for a multi-wavelength identification campaign.
