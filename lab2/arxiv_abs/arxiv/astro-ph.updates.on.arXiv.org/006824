Recently, a widely publicized claim has been made that the Aboriginal Australians discovered the
variability of the red star Betelgeuse in the modern Orion, plus the variability of two other prominent
red stars: Aldebaran and Antares. This result has excited the usual healthy skepticism, with questions
about whether any untrained peoples can discover the variability and whether such a discovery is
likely to be placed into lore and transmitted for long periods of time. Here, I am offering an independent
evaluation, based on broad experience with naked-eye sky viewing and astro-history. I find that
it is easy for inexperienced observers to detect the variability of Betelgeuse over its range in
brightness from V = 0.0 to V = 1.3, for example in noticing from season-to-season that the star varies
from significantly brighter than Procyon to being greatly fainter than Procyon. Further, indigenous
peoples in the Southern Hemisphere inevitably kept watch on the prominent red star, so it is inevitable
that the variability of Betelgeuse was discovered many times over during the last 65 millennia.
The processes of placing this discovery into a cultural context (in this case, put into morality
stories) and the faithful transmission for many millennia is confidently known for the Aboriginal
Australians in particular. So this shows that the whole claim for a changing Betelgeuse in the Aboriginal
Australian lore is both plausible and likely. Given that the discovery and transmission is easily
possible, the real proof is that the Aboriginal lore gives an unambiguous statement that these stars
do indeed vary in brightness, as collected by many ethnographers over a century ago from many Aboriginal
groups. So I strongly conclude that the Aboriginal Australians could and did discover the variability
of Betelgeuse, Aldebaran, and Antares.
