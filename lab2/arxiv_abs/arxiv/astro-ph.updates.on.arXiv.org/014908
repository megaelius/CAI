The correlation between neutral Hydrogen (HI) in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and galaxies now
attracts great interests. We select four fields which include several coherently strong Ly$\alpha$
absorption systems at $z\sim2.2$ detected by using background quasars from the whole SDSS/(e)BOSS
database. Deep narrow-band and $g$-band imaging are performed using the Hyper Suprime-Cam on the
Subaru Telescope. We select out 2,642 Ly$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) candidates at $z=2.177\pm0.023$
down to the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity of $L_{\text{Ly}\alpha}\approx 2 \times 10^{42} {\rm erg~s}^{-1}$
to construct the galaxy overdensity maps, covering an effective area of 5.39 deg$^2$. Combining
the sample with the Ly$\alpha$ absorption estimated from 64 (e)BOSS quasar spectra, we find a moderate
to strong correlation between the LAE overdensity $\delta_{\rm LAE}$ and the effective optical
depth $\tau_{\rm LoS}$ in line-of-sights, with $P$-value$=0.09\%$ ($<0.01\%$) when the field
that contains a significant quasar overdensity is in(ex)cluded. The cross-correlation analysis
also clearly suggests that up to $4\pm1$ pMpc, LAEs tend to cluster in the regions rich in HI gas, indicated
by the high $\tau_{\rm LoS}$, and avoid the low $\tau_{\rm LoS}$ region where the HI gas is deficient.
By averaging the $\tau_{\rm LoS}$ as a function of the projected distance ($d$) to LAEs, we find a
$30\%$ excess signal at $2\sigma$ level at $d<200$ pkpc, indicating the dense HI in circumgalactic
medium, and a tentative excess at $400<d<600$ pkpc in IGM regime, corroborating the cross-correlation
signal detected at about $0.5$ pMpc. These statistical analyses indicate that galaxy$-$IGM HI
correlations exist on scales ranging from several hundred pkpc to several pMpc at $z\sim2.2$.
