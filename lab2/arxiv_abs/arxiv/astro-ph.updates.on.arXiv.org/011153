Supersonic turbulence results in strong density fluctuations in the interstellar medium (ISM),
which have a profound effect on the chemical structure. Particularly useful probes of the diffuse
ISM are the ArH$^+$, OH$^+$, H$_2$O$^+$ molecular ions, which are highly sensitive to fluctuations
in the density and the H$_2$ abundance. We use isothermal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations
of various sonic Mach numbers, $\mathcal{M}_s$, and density decorrelation scales, $y_{\rm dec}$,
to model the turbulent density field. We post-process the simulations with chemical models and
obtain the probability density functions (PDFs) for the H$_2$, ArH$^+$, OH$^+$ and H$_2$O$^+$
abundances. We find that the PDF dispersions increases with increasing $\mathcal{M}_s$ and $y_{\rm
dec}$, as the magnitude of the density fluctuations increases, and as they become more coherent.
Turbulence also affects the median abundances: when $\mathcal{M}_s$ and $y_{\rm dec}$ are high,
low-density regions with low H$_2$ abundance become prevalent, resulting in an enhancement of
ArH$^+$ compared to OH$^+$ and H$_2$O$^+$. We compare our models with Herschel observations. The
large scatter in the observed abundances, as well as the high observed ArH$^+$/OH$^+$ and ArH$^+$/H$_2$O$^+$
ratios are naturally reproduced by our supersonic $(\mathcal{M}_s=4.5)$, large decorrelation
scale $(y_{\rm dec}=0.8)$ model, supporting a scenario of a large-scale turbulence driving. The
abundances also depend on the UV intensity, CR ionization rate, and the cloud column density, and
the observed scatter may be influenced by fluctuations in these parameters.
