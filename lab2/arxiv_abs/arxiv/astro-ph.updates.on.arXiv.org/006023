We examine a magnitude limited (MB <-18.7) sample of post-starburst (PSB) galaxies at 0.03 < z < 0.11
in the different environments from the spectroscopic data set of the Padova Millennium Galaxy Group
Catalog and compare their incidence and properties with those of passive (PAS) and emission line
galaxies (EML). PSB galaxies have a quite precise life-time (< 1 - 1.5Gyr), and they hold important
clues for understanding galaxy evolution. While the properties (stellar mass, absolute magnitude,
color) of PSBs do not depend on environment, their frequency increases going from single galaxies
to binary systems to groups, both considering the incidence with respect to the global number of
galaxies and to the number of currently+recently star-forming galaxies. Including in our analysis
the sample of cluster PSBs drawn from the WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey presented in
Paccagnella et al. , we extend the halo mass range covered and present a coherent picture of the effect
of the environment on galaxy transformations. We find that the PSB/(PSB+EML) fraction steadily
increases with halo mass going from 1% in 10^11Msun haloes to ~15% in the most massive haloes (10^15.5Msun).
Our analysis does not allow us to definitely identify the main mechanisms responsible for the appearance
of the PSB spectrum. However, the higher incidence of PSB galaxies in the densest environments suggests
that the processes operating in the most massive haloes, such as ram pressure stripping, are more
effective in producing such population than the processes operating in the sparsest environments,
most likely galaxy interactions.
