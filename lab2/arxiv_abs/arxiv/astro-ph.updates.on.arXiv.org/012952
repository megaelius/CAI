We present half-light sizes measured from H${\alpha}$ emission tracing star-formation in 281
star-forming galaxies from the KMOS3D survey at 0.7 < z < 2.7. Sizes are derived by fitting 2D exponential
disk models, with bootstrap errors averaging 20%. H${\alpha}$ sizes are a median (mean) of 1.19
(1.26) times larger than those of the stellar continuum, which due to radial dust gradients places
an upper limit on the growth in stellar size via star formation, with just 43% intrinsic scatter.
At fixed continuum size the H${\alpha}$ size shows no residual trend with stellar mass, star formation
rate, redshift or morphology. The only significant residual trend is with the excess obscuration
of H${\alpha}$ by dust, at fixed continuum obscuration. The scatter in continuum size at fixed stellar
mass is likely driven by the scatter in halo spin parameters. The stability of the ratio of H${\alpha}$
size to continuum size demonstrates a high degree of stability in halo spin and in the transfer of
angular momentum to the disk over a wide range of physical conditions and cosmic time. This may require
local regulation by feedback processes. The implication of our results, as we demonstrate using
a toy model, is that our upper limit on star-formation driven growth is sufficient only to evolve
star-forming galaxies approximately along the observed size-mass relation, consistent with
the size growth of galaxies at constant cumulative co-moving number density. To explain the observed
evolution of the size-mass relation of star-forming disk galaxies other processes, such as the
preferential quenching of compact galaxies or galaxy mergers, may be required.
