Silver is a metal which provides the highest reflectivity in the very broad wavelength range as well
as the lowest polarization splitting. However, it is not very stable chemically and silver mirrors
are easily damaged in a corrosive or oxidizing environment, leading first to the drastic drop in
reflection followed by the complete disintegration of a silver layer. For this reason aluminum
is much more in use. The problem of protection of silver layer is a very important one for number of
applications, requiring the front side reflection, such as telescopes mirrors, reflective IR
imaging optics, gratings, photovoltaic concentrator mirrors, etc. Atomic layer deposition (ALD)
technique using trimethylaluminum (TMA) and water as precursors provides a very efficient way
to protect a sensitive surface of silver from a corrosive and oxidizing environment, because ALD
coatings can be deposited at rather low temperature. Moreover, ALD layer provides extremely high
conformality (even when deposited over high aspect ratio features) and has high integrity, efficiently
blocking foreign species diffusion to silver-overcoat interface. In our studies we tested the
efficiency of the protection of silver mirrors by ALD-deposited Al2O3 layers against oxygen plasma
exposure by correlating the ellipsometric measurements with the absolute reflection measurements
and Glow-Discharge Optical Emission Spectroscopy (GD-OES) data. We have found that for optimal
protection the thickness of ALD deposited layer should exceed at least 15 nm (about 150 ALD cycles
at 150 oC), as thinner layers do not provide reliable protection of silver surface against oxygen
plasma. We have also demonstrated that the deposition of 15 nm of a protective ALD-deposited Al2O3
layer does not affect the absolute reflectivity of a silver mirror in a spectral range 300 -2500 nm.
