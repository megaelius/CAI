While ~150 massive black hole binary (MBHB) candidates, at sub-pc orbital separations, have been
reported in recent literature, the definitive detection of even a single such object remains elusive.
Here we describe a signature of MBHBs that will aid in uniquely identifying them in time domain surveys.
We model the signature of gravitational lensing of an accretion disc surrounding a massive black
hole (MBH) by another orbiting MBH in a compact, sub-pc, MBHB system. We show that, for MBHBs with
masses in the range 10^6 - 10^10 solar masses and with orbital periods less then ~10 years, strong
lensing events should occur in 1 to 10's of percent of MBHB systems that are monitored for an entire
orbit. Lensing events will last from days for the less massive, shorter period MBHBs up to a year for
the most massive ~10 year orbital period MBHBs. At small inclinations of the binary orbit to the line
of sight, lensing must occur and will necessarily be accompanied by a sinusoidal variation due to
the relativistic Doppler boost. Flares at the same phase as the otherwise average flux value of the
Doppler modulation would be a smoking gun signature of lensing in a MBHB system. Simultaneous observation
of the Doppler boost and lensing would also constrain binary orbital parameters including the orbital
inclination and mass ratio. For MBHBs with separation above ~100 Schwarzschild radii, we show that
finite-size source effects could serve as a probe of accretion disc structure around the MBHs. Finally,
we stress that our lensing probability estimate implies that ~10 of the known MBHB candidates identified
through quasar periodicity should exhibit strong lensing flares.
