We characterize the radii and masses of the star and planets in the Kepler-59 system, as well as their
orbital parameters. The star parameters are determined through a standard spectroscopic analysis,
resulting in a mass of $1.359\pm 0.155\,M_\odot$ and a radius of $1.367\pm 0.078\,R_\odot$. The
planetary radii obtained are $1.5\pm 0.1\,R_\oplus$ for the inner and $2.2\pm 0.1\,R_\oplus$
for the outer planet. The orbital parameters and the planetary masses are determined by the inversion
of Transit Timing Variations (TTV) signals. For this, we consider two different data sets, one provided
by Holczer et al. 2016, with TTVs only for the planet Kepler-59c, and the other provided by Rowe et
al. 2015, with TTVs signals for both planets. The inversion method is carried out by applying an algorithm
of Bayesian inference (MultiNest) combined with an efficient N-body integrator (Swift). For each
of the data sets, two possible solutions are found, both having the same probability according to
their corresponding Bayesian evidences. All four solutions appear to be indistinguishable within
their 2-$\sigma$ uncertainties. Nevertheless, statistical analyses show that the solutions
from Rowe et al. 2015 data better characterize the data. The first and second solutions identify
masses of $5_{-2}^{+4}~M_{\mathrm{\oplus}}$ and $4.6_{-2.0}^{+3.6}~M_{\mathrm{\oplus}}$,
and $3.0^{+0.8}_{-0.8}~M_{\mathrm{\oplus}}$ and $2.6^{+1.9}_{-0.8}~M_{\mathrm{\oplus}}$
for the inner and outer planet, respectively. This points to a system with an inner super-Earth and
an outer mini-Neptune. Dynamical studies show the planets have almost co-planar orbits with small
eccentricities ($e<0.1$), close but not into the 3:2 mean motion resonance. Stability analysis
indicates that this configuration is stable over million years of evolution.
