The capacity of Stage IV lensing surveys to measure the neutrino mass sum and differentiate between
the normal and inverted mass hierarchies depends on the impact of nuisance parameters describing
small-scale baryonic astrophysics and intrinsic alignments. For a Euclid-like survey, we perform
the first combined weak lensing and galaxy clustering Fisher analysis with baryons, intrinsic
alignments, and massive neutrinos for both hierarchies. We use a matter power spectrum generated
from a halo model that captures the impact of baryonic feedback and adiabatic contraction. For weak
lensing, we find that baryons cause severe degradation to forecasts of the neutrino mass sum, $\Sigma$,
approximately doubling $\sigma_{\Sigma}$. We show that including galaxy clustering constraints
from Euclid and BOSS, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) Planck priors, can reduce this degradation
to $\sigma_{\Sigma}$ to 9% and 16% for the normal and inverted hierarchies respectively. The combined
forecasts, $\sigma_{\Sigma_{\rm{NH}}}=0.034\, \rm{eV}$ and $\sigma_{\Sigma_{\rm{IH}}}=0.034\,
\rm{eV}$, preclude a meaningful distinction of the hierarchies but could be improved upon with
future CMB priors on $n_s$ and information from neutrinoless double beta decay to achieve a 2$\sigma$
distinction. The effect of intrinsic alignments on forecasts is shown to be minimal, with $\sigma_{\Sigma}$
even experiencing mild improvements due to information from the intrinsic alignment signal. We
find that while adiabatic contraction and intrinsic alignments will require careful calibration
to prevent significant biasing of $\Sigma$, there is less risk presented by feedback from energetic
events like AGN and supernovae.
