The most distant known quasar recently discovered by Ba\~nados et al. (2018) is at $z=7.5$ (690 Myr
after the Big Bang), at the dawn of galaxy formation. We explore the host galaxy of the brightest quasar
in the large volume cosmological hydrodynamic simulation BlueTides, which in Phase II has reached
these redshifts. The brightest quasar in BlueTides has a luminosity of a $\sim$ few $10^{13} L_{\odot}$
and a black hole mass of $6.4 \times 10^{8} M_{\odot}$ at $z \sim 7.5$, comparable to the observed
quasar (the only one in this large volume). The quasar resides in a rare halo of mass $M_{H} \sim 10^{12}
M_{\odot}$ and has a host galaxy of stellar mass of $4 \times 10^{10}M_{\odot}$ with an ongoing (intrinsic)
star formation rate of $\sim 80 M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$. The corresponding intrinsic UV magnitude of
the galaxy is $-23.1$, which is roughly $2.7$ magnitudes fainter than the quasar's magnitude of
$-25.9$. We find that the galaxy is highly metal enriched with a mean metallicity equal to the solar
value. We derive quasar and galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) in the mid and near infrared
JWST bands. We predict a significant amount of dust attenuation in the rest-frame UV corresponding
to $A_{1500} \sim 1.7$ giving an UV based SFR of $\sim 14 M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$. We present mock JWST
images of the galaxy with and without central point source, in different MIRI and NIRCam filters.
The host galaxy is detectable in NIRCam filters, but it is extremely compact ($R_{E}=0.35$ kpc).
It will require JWST's exquisite sensitivity and resolution to separate the galaxy from the central
point source. Finally within the FOV of the quasar in BlueTides there are two more sources that would
be detectable by JWST.
