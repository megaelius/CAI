We present broadband polarimetric observations of a sample of high Faraday rotation measure (RM)
AGN using the VLA telescope from 1 to 2 GHz, and 4 to 12 GHz. The sample (14 sources) consists of compact
sources (linear resolution smaller than ~ 5 kpc) that are unpolarized at 1.4 GHz in the NVSS. Total
intensity data have been modelled using combination of synchrotron components, revealing complex
structure in their radio spectra. Depolarization modelling, through the so called qu-fitting,
have been performed on the polarized data using an equation that attempts to simplify the process
of fitting many different depolarization models that we can divide into two major categories: External
Depolarization and Internal Depolarization models. Understanding which of the two mechanisms
are the most representative, would help the qualitative understanding of the AGN jet environment,
whether it is embedded in a dense external magnetoionic medium or if it is the jet-wind that causes
the high RM and strong depolarization. This could help to probe the jet magnetic field geometry (e.g.
helical or otherwise). This new high-sensitivity data, shows a complicated behaviour in the total
intensity and polarization radio spectrum of individual sources. We observed the presence of several
synchrotron components and Faraday components in their total intensity and polarized spectra.
For the majority of our targets, (12 sources) the depolarization seems to be caused by a turbulent
magnetic field. Thus, our main selection criteria (lack of polarization at 1.4 GHz in the NVSS),
results in a sample of sources with very large RMs and depolarization due to turbulent magnetic fields
local to the source. We show how the new qu-fitting technique can be used to probe the magnetised radio
source environment and to spectrally resolve the polarized components of unresolved radio sources.
