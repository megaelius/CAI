We study the $\gamma$-ray and broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) properties of a complete
sample of 104 bright, radio-selected low-synchrotron peaked (LSP) blazars. Most of the sources
have already been detected in the $\gamma$-ray band by Fermi-LAT, however almost 20% of these blazars
have no counterpart in any of the Fermi catalogs so far. Using the Fermi Science Tools, we look for
$\gamma$-ray emission for those objects not yet reported in any Fermi-LAT catalog. We performed
a binned likelihood analysis in the 0.3-500 GeV energy band with Fermi-LAT Pass 8 data, integrating
over 7.5 years of observations. We studied $\gamma$-ray light curves and test statistic (TS) maps
to validate new detections and associations. We fit the synchrotron (Syn) and inverse Compton (IC)
components for all sources using all available historical data, enhancing the study of Syn to IC
peak-power correlations. We derive the distribution of the Compton dominance (CD) along with population
properties such as Syn and IC peak power, and frequency distributions. We deliver a unique characterization
in $\gamma$-rays for a complete sample of LSP blazars. We show that three previously unidentified
3FGL sources can be associated with blazars when using improved $\gamma$-ray positions obtained
from TS maps. Six previously unreported $\gamma$-ray sources are detected at TS>20 level, while
another three show TS values between 10-20. We evaluate two cases in which source confusion is likely
present. In four cases there is no significant $\gamma$-ray signature, however short-lived flares
have been detected in these sources. Finally, the log(CD) has a Gaussian-like distribution with
median log(CD)=0.1, implying that on average the peak-power for the Syn and IC components in LSP
blazars are similar.
