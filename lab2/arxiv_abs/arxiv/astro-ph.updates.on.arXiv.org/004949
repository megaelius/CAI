The {\delta} Sct stars are a diverse group of intermediate-mass pulsating stars located on and near
the main sequence within the classical instability strip in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.
Many of these stars are hybrid stars pulsating simultaneously with pressure and gravity modes that
probe the physics at different depths within a star's interior. Using two large ensembles of {\delta}
Sct stars observed by the Kepler Space Telescope, the instrumental biases inherent to Kepler mission
data and the statistical properties of these stars are investigated. An important focus of this
work is an analysis of the relationships between the pulsational and stellar parameters, and their
distribution within the classical instability strip. It is found that a non-negligible fraction
of main sequence {\delta} Sct stars exist outside theoretical predictions of the classical instability
boundaries, which indicates the necessity of a mass-dependent mixing length parameter to simultaneously
explain low- and high-radial order pressure modes in {\delta} Sct stars within the Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram. Furthermore, a search for regularities in the amplitude spectra of these stars is also
presented, specifically the frequency difference between pressure modes of consecutive radial
order. In this work, it is demonstrated that an ensemble-based approach using space photometry
from the Kepler mission is not only plausible for {\delta} Sct stars, but that it is a valuable method
for identifying the most promising stars for mode identification and asteroseismic modelling.
The full scientific potential of studying {\delta} Sct stars is as yet unrealised. The ensembles
discussed in this paper represent a high-quality data set for future studies of rotation and angular
momentum transport inside A and F stars using asteroseismology.
