We are undertaking a large survey of over thirty disks using the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) to see
whether the observed dust structures match spectral energy distribution (SED) predictions and
have any correlation with stellar properties. GPI can observe near-infrared light scattered from
dust in circumstellar environments using high-resolution Polarimetric Differential Imaging
(PDI) with coronagraphy and adaptive optics. The data have been taken in J and H bands over two years,
with inner working angles of 0.08'' and 0.11'' respectively. Ahead of the release of the complete
survey results, here we present five objects with extended and irregular dust structures within
2'' of the central star. These objects are: FU Ori; MWC 789; HD 45677; Hen 3-365; and HD 139614. The
observed structures are consistent with each object being a pre-main-sequence star with protoplanetary
dust. The five objects' circumstellar environments could result from extreme youth and complex
initial conditions, from asymmetric scattering patterns due to shadows cast by misaligned disks,
or in some cases from interactions with companions. We see complex U_phi structures in most objects
that could indicate multiple scattering or result from the illumination of companions. Specific
key findings include the first high-contrast observation of MWC 789 revealing a newly-discovered
companion candidate and arc, and two faint companion candidates around Hen 3-365. These two objects
should be observed further to confirm whether the companion candidates are co-moving. Further
observations and modeling are required to determine the causes of the structures.
