We describe new Hi-GAL based maps of the entire Galactic Plane, obtained using continuum data in
the wavelength range 70-500 $\mu$m. These maps are derived with the PPMAP procedure, and therefore
represent a significant improvement over those obtained with standard analysis techniques. Specifically
they have greatly improved resolution (12 arcsec) and, in addition to more accurate integrated
column densities and mean dust temperatures, they give temperature-differential column densities,
i.e., separate column density maps in twelve distinct dust temperature intervals, along with the
corresponding uncertainty maps. The complete set of maps is available on-line. We briefly describe
PPMAP and present some illustrative examples of the results. These include (a) multi-temperature
maps of the Galactic HII region W5-E, (b) the temperature decomposition of molecular cloud column-density
probability distribution functions, and (c) the global variation of mean dust temperature as a
function of Galactocentric distance. Amongst our findings are: (i) a strong localised temperature
gradient in W5-E in a direction orthogonal to that towards the ionising star, suggesting an alternative
heating source and providing possible guidance for models of the formation of the bubble complex,
and (ii) the overall radial profile of dust temperature in the Galaxy shows a monotonic decrease,
broadly consistent both with models of the interstellar radiation field and with previous estimates
at lower resolution. However, we also find a central temperature plateau within ~ 6 kpc of the Galactic
centre, outside of which is a pronounced steepening of the radial profile. This behaviour may reflect
the greater proportion of molecular (as opposed to atomic) gas in the central region of the Galaxy.
