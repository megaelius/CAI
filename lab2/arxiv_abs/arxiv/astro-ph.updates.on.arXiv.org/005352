We report results from an exploratory study implementing a new probe of Galactic evolution using
archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging observations. Precise proper motions are combined with
photometric relative metallicity and temperature indices, to produce the proper motion rotation
curves of the Galactic bulge separately for metal-poor and metal-rich Main Sequence samples. This
provides a "pencil-beam" complement to large-scale wide-field surveys, which to-date have focused
on the more traditional bright Giant Branch tracers. We find strong evidence that the Galactic bulge
rotation curves drawn from "Metal-rich" and "Metal-poor" samples are indeed discrepant. The "Metal-rich"
sample shows greater rotation amplitude and a steeper gradient against line of sight distance,
as possibly a stronger central concentration along the line of sight. This may represent a new detection
of differing orbital anisotropy between metal-rich and metal-poor bulge objects. We also investigate
selection effects that would be implied for the longitudinal proper motion cut often used to isolate
a "pure-bulge" sample. Extensive investigation of synthetic stellar populations suggest that
instrumental and observational artifacts are unlikely to account for the observed rotation curve
differences. Thus, proper motion-based rotation curves can be used to probe chemo-dynamical correlations
for Main Sequence tracer stars, which are orders of magnitude more numerous in the Galactic Bulge
than the bright Giant Branch tracers. We discuss briefly the prospect of using this new tool to constrain
detailed models of Galactic formation and evolution.
