We present ALMA [CII] line and far-infrared (FIR) continuum observations of three $z > 6$ low-luminosity
quasars ($M_{\rm 1450} > -25$) discovered by our Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey. The [CII]
line was detected in all three targets with luminosities of $(2.4 - 9.5) \times 10^8~L_\odot$, about
one order of magnitude smaller than optically luminous ($M_{\rm 1450} \lesssim -25$) quasars.
The FIR continuum luminosities range from $< 9 \times 10^{10}~L_\odot$ (3$\sigma$ limit) to $\sim
2 \times 10^{12}~L_\odot$, indicating a wide range in star formation rates in these galaxies. Most
of the HSC quasars studied thus far show [CII]/FIR luminosity ratios similar to local star-forming
galaxies. Using the [CII]-based dynamical mass ($M_{\rm dyn}$) as a surrogate for bulge stellar
mass ($M_{\rm bulge}$), we find that a significant fraction of low-luminosity quasars are located
on or even below the local $M_{\rm BH} - M_{\rm bulge}$ relation, particularly at the massive end
of the galaxy mass distribution. In contrast, previous studies of optically luminous quasars have
found that black holes are overmassive relative to the local relation. Given the low luminosities
of our targets, we are exploring the nature of the early co-evolution of supermassive black holes
and their hosts in a less biased way. Almost all of the quasars presented in this work are growing their
black hole mass at much higher pace at $z \sim 6$ than the parallel growth model, in which supermassive
black holes and their hosts grow simultaneously to match the local $M_{\rm BH} - M_{\rm bulge}$ relation
at all redshifts. As the low-luminosity quasars appear to realize the local co-evolutionary relation
even at $z \sim 6$, they should have experienced vigorous starbursts prior to the currently observed
quasar phase to catch up with the relation.
