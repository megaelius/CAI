We perform a detailed forecast on how well a {\sc Euclid}-like survey will be able to constrain dark
energy and neutrino parameters from a combination of its cosmic shear power spectrum, galaxy power
spectrum, and cluster mass function measurements. We find that the combination of these three probes
vastly improves the survey's potential to measure the time evolution of dark energy. In terms of
a dark energy figure-of-merit defined as $(\sigma(w_{\mathrm p}) \sigma(w_a))^{-1}$, we find
a value of 690 for {\sc Euclid}-like data combined with {\sc Planck}-like measurements of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) anisotropies in a 10-dimensional cosmological parameter space, assuming
a $\Lambda$CDM fiducial cosmology. For the more commonly used 7-parameter model, we find a figure-of-merit
of 1900 for the same data combination. We consider also the survey's potential to measure dark energy
perturbations in models wherein the dark energy is parameterised as a fluid with a nonstandard non-adiabatic
sound speed, and find that in an \emph{optimistic} scenario in which $w_0$ deviates by as much as
is currently observationally allowed from $-1$, models with $\hat{c}_\mathrm{s}^2 = 10^{-6}$
and $\hat{c}_\mathrm{s}^2 = 1$ can be distinguished at more than $2\sigma$ significance. We emphasise
that constraints on the dark energy sound speed from cluster measurements are strongly dependent
on the modelling of the cluster mass function; significantly weaker sensitivities ensue if we modify
our model to include fewer features of nonlinear dark energy clustering. Finally, we find that the
sum of neutrino masses can be measured with a $1 \sigma$ precision of 0.015~eV, (abridged)
