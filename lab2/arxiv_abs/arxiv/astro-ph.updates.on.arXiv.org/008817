Probing the origin of r-process elements in the universe represents a multi-disciplinary challenge.
We review the observational evidence that probe the properties of r-process sites, and address
them using galactic chemical evolution simulations, binary population synthesis models, and
nucleosynthesis calculations. Our motivation is to define which astrophysical sites have significantly
contributed to the total mass of r-process elements present in our Galaxy. We found discrepancies
with the neutron star (NS-NS) merger scenario. Assuming they are the only site, the decreasing trend
of [Eu/Fe] at [Fe/H]\,$>-1$ in the disk of the Milky Way cannot be reproduced while accounting for
the delay-time distribution (DTD) of coalescence times ($\propto~t^{-1}$) derived from short
gamma-ray bursts and population synthesis models. Steeper DTD functions ($\propto~t^{-1.5}$)
or power laws combined with a strong burst of mergers before the onset of Type~Ia supernovae can reproduce
the [Eu/Fe] trend, but this scenario is inconsistent with the similar fraction of short gamma-ray
bursts and Type~Ia supernovae occurring in early-type galaxies, and reduces the probability of
detecting GW170817 in an early-type galaxy. One solution is to assume an extra production site of
Eu that would be active in the early universe, but would fade away with increasing metallicity. If
this is correct, this extra site could be responsible for roughly 50% of the Eu production in the early
universe, before the onset of Type~Ia supernovae. Rare classes of supernovae could be this additional
r-process source, but hydrodynamic simulations still need to ensure the conditions for a robust
r-process pattern.
