Poorly understood "baryonic physics" impacts our ability to predict the power spectrum of the kinetic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. We study this in one sample high resolution simulation of galaxy
formation and feedback, Illustris. The high resolution of Illustris allows us to probe the kSZ power
spectrum on multipoles $\ell =10^3-3\times 10^4$. Strong AGN feedback in Illustris nearly wipes
out gas fluctuations at $k\gtrsim1~h~\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and at late times, likely somewhat under
predicting the kSZ power generated at $z\lesssim 1$. The post-reionization kSZ power spectrum
for Illustris is well-fit by $\mathcal{D}^{z<6}_{\ell} = 1.38[\ell/3000]^{0.21}~\mu K^2$ over
$3000\lesssim\ell\lesssim10000$, somewhat lower than most other reported values but consistent
with the analysis of Shaw et al. Our analysis of the bias of free electrons reveals subtle effects
associated with the multi-phase gas physics and stellar fractions that affect even linear scales.
In particular there are fewer electrons in biased galaxies, due to gas cooling and star formation,
and this leads to an electron bias less than one even at low wavenumbers. The combination of bias and
electron fraction that determines the overall suppression is relatively constant, $f_e^2b^2_{e0}
\sim 0.7$, but more simulations are needed to see if this is Illustris-specific. By separating the
kSZ power into different terms, we find at least $6\, (10)\%$ of the signal at $\ell=3000\, (10000)$
comes from non-Gaussian connected four-point density and velocity correlations, $\left<\delta
v \delta v\right>_{c}$, even without correcting for the Illustris simulation box size. A challenge
going forward will be to accurately model long-wave velocity modes simultaneously with Illustris-like
high resolution to capture the complexities of galaxy formation and its correlations with large
scale flows.
