We present 48 Herschel/PACS spectra of evolved stars in the wavelength range of 67-72 $\mu$m. This
wavelength range covers the 69 $\mu$m band of crystalline olivine ($\text{Mg}_{2-2x}\text{Fe}_{(2x)}\text{SiO}_{4}$).
The width and wavelength position of this band are sensitive to the temperature and composition
of the crystalline olivine. Our sample covers a wide range of objects: from high mass-loss rate AGB
stars (OH/IR stars, $\dot M \ge 10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$/yr), through post-AGB stars with and without
circumbinary disks, to planetary nebulae and even a few massive evolved stars. The goal of this study
is to exploit the spectral properties of the 69 $\mu$m band to determine the composition and temperature
of the crystalline olivine. Since the objects cover a range of evolutionary phases, we study the
physical and chemical properties in this range of physical environments. We fit the 69 $\mu$m band
and use its width and position to probe the composition and temperature of the crystalline olivine.
For 27 sources in the sample, we detected the 69 $\mu$m band of crystalline olivine ($\text{Mg}_{(2-2x)}\text{Fe}_{(2x)}\text{SiO}_{4}$).
The 69 $\mu$m band shows that all the sources produce pure forsterite grains containing no iron in
their lattice structure. The temperature of the crystalline olivine as indicated by the 69 $\mu$m
band, shows that on average the temperature of the crystalline olivine is highest in the group of
OH/IR stars and the post-AGB stars with confirmed Keplerian disks. The temperature is lower for
the other post-AGB stars and lowest for the planetary nebulae. A couple of the detected 69 $\mu$m
bands are broader than those of pure magnesium-rich crystalline olivine, which we show can be due
to a temperature gradient in the circumstellar environment of these stars. continued...
