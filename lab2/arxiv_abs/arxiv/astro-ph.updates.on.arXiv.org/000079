[abridged] Aims. The aim of the present paper is to provide new and more detailed relations at the
kpc scale between the gas surface density and the face-on optical depth directly calibrated on galaxies,
in order to compute the attenuation not only for semi-analytic models but also observationally
as new and upcoming radio observatories are able to trace gas ever farther in the Universe. Methods.
We have selected a sample of 4 nearby resolved galaxies and a sample of 27 unresolved galaxies from
the Herschel Reference Survey and the Very Nearby Galaxies Survey, for which we have a large set of
multi-wavelength data from the FUV to the FIR including metallicity gradients for resolved galaxies,
along with radio HI and CO observations. For each pixel in resolved galaxies and for each galaxy in
the unresolved sample, we compute the face-on optical depth from the attenuation determined with
the CIGALE SED fitting code and an assumed geometry. We determine the gas surface density from HI
and CO observations with a metallicity-dependent XCO factor. Results. We provide new, simple to
use, relations to determine the face-on optical depth from the gas surface density, taking the metallicity
into account, which proves to be crucial for a proper estimate. The method used to determine the gas
surface density or the face-on optical depth has little impact on the relations except for galaxies
that have an inclination over 50d. Finally, we provide detailed instructions on how to compute the
attenuation practically from the gas surface density taking into account possible information
on the metallicity. Conclusions. Examination of the influence of these new relations on simulated
FUV and IR luminosity functions shows a clear impact compared to older oft-used relations, which
in turn could affect the conclusions drawn from studies based on large scale cosmological simulations.
