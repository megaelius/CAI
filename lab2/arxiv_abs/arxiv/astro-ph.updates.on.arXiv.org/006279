We describe the application of the supervised machine-learning algorithms to identify the likely
multi-wavelength counterparts to submillimeter sources detected in panoramic, single-dish
submillimeter surveys. As a training set, we employ a sample of 695 ($S_{\rm 870\mu m}$ >1 mJy) submillimeter
galaxies (SMGs) with precise identifications from the ALMA follow-up of the SCUBA-2 Cosmology
Legacy Survey's UKIDSS-UDS field (AS2UDS). We show that radio emission, near-/mid-infrared colors,
photometric redshift, and absolute $H$-band magnitude are effective predictors that can distinguish
SMGs from submillimeter-faint field galaxies. Our combined radio+machine-learning method is
able to successfully recover $\sim$85 percent of ALMA-identified SMGs which are detected in at
least three bands from the ultraviolet to radio. We confirm the robustness of our method by dividing
our training set into independent subsets and using these for training and testing respectively,
as well as applying our method to an independent sample of $\sim$100 ALMA-identified SMGs from the
ALMA/LABOCA ECDF-South Survey (ALESS). To further test our methodology, we stack the 870$\mu$m
ALMA maps at the positions of those $K$-band galaxies that are classified as SMG counterparts by
the machine-learning but do not have a $>$4.3$ \sigma$ ALMA detection. The median peak flux density
of these galaxies is $S_{\rm 870\mu m}=(0.61\pm0.03)$ mJy, demonstrating that our method can recover
faint and/or diffuse SMGs even when they are below the detection threshold of our ALMA observations.
In future, we will apply this method to samples drawn from panoramic single-dish submillimeter
surveys which currently lack interferometric follow-up observations, to address science questions
which can only be tackled with large, statistical samples of SMGs.
