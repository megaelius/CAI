The role of turbulence in low-$\beta$, guide-field reconnection exhausts is explored in 2D reconnection
and 2D and 3D Riemann simulations. The structure of the exhaust and associated turbulence is controlled
by a pair of rotational discontinuities (RDs) at the exhaust boundary and a pair of slow shocks (SSs)
that are generated by counterstreaming ions beams. In 2D the exhaust develops large-amplitude
striations at the ion Larmor radius scale that are produced by electron-beam-driven ion cyclotron
waves. The electron beams driving the instability are injected into the exhaust from one of the RDs.
However, in 3D Riemann simulations, the additional dimension (in the out-of-plane direction)
results in strong Buneman and electron-electron streaming instabilities at the RD which suppress
electron beam formation and therefore the striations in the exhaust. The strength of the streaming
instabilities at the RD are controlled by the ratio of the electron thermal speed to Alfv\'en speed,
lower thermal speed being more unstable. In the 3D simulations an ion-ion streaming instability
acts to partially thermalize the counterstreaming ion beams at the SSs. This instability is controlled
by the ratio of the sound speed to Alfv\'en speed and is expected to be stable in the low $\beta$ solar
corona. The results suggest that in a guide field reconnection exhaust with $1 \gg \beta > m_e/m_i$,
the kinetic-scale turbulence that develops will be too weak to play a significant role in energy
conversion and particle acceleration. Therefore, the energy conversion will be mostly controlled
by laminar physics or multi-x-line reconnection.
