During stellar evolution, especially in the PMS, stellar structure and rotation evolve significantly
causing major changes in the dynamics and global flows of the star. We wish to assess the consequences
of these changes on stellar dynamo, internal magnetic field topology and activity level. To do so,
we have performed a series of 3D HD and MHD simulations with the ASH code. We choose five different
models characterized by the radius of their radiative zone following an evolutionary track computed
by a 1D stellar evolution code. These models characterized stellar evolution from 1 Myr to 50 Myr.
By introducing a seed magnetic field in the fully convective model and spreading its evolved state
through all four remaining cases, we observe systematic variations in the dynamical properties
and magnetic field amplitude and topology of the models. The five MHD simulations develop strong
dynamo field that can reach equipartition state between the kinetic and magnetic energy and even
super- equipartition levels in the faster rotating cases. We find that the magnetic field amplitude
increases as it evolves toward the ZAMS. Moreover the magnetic field topology becomes more complex,
with a decreasing axisymmetric component and a non-axisymmetric one becoming predominant. The
dipolar components decrease as the rotation rate and the size of the radiative core increase. The
magnetic fields possess a mixed poloidal-toroidal topology with no obvious dominant component.
Moreover the relaxation of the vestige dynamo magnetic field within the radiative core is found
to satisfy MHD stability criteria. Hence it does not experience a global reconfiguration but slowly
relaxes by retaining its mixed stable poloidal-toroidal topology.
