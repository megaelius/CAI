We present a new measurement of the evolving galaxy far-IR luminosity function (LF) extending out
to redshifts z~5, with resulting implications for the level of dust-obscured star-formation density
in the young Universe. To achieve this we have exploited recent advances in sub-mm/mm imaging with
SCUBA-2 on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter
Array (ALMA), which together provide unconfused imaging with sufficient dynamic range to provide
meaningful coverage of the luminosity-redshift plane out to z>4. Our results support previous
indications that the faint-end slope of the far-IR LF is sufficiently flat that comoving luminosity-density
is dominated by bright objects (~L*). However, we find that the number-density/luminosity of such
sources at high redshifts has been severely over-estimated by studies that have attempted to push
the highly-confused Herschel SPIRE surveys beyond z~2. Consequently we confirm recent reports
that cosmic star-formation density is dominated by UV-visible star formation at z>4. Using both
direct (1/Vmax) and maximum likelihood determinations of the LF, we find that its high-redshift
evolution is well characterized by continued positive luminosity evolution coupled with negative
density evolution (with increasing redshift). This explains why bright sub-mm sources continue
to be found at z>5, even though their integrated contribution to cosmic star-formation density
at such early times is very small. The evolution of the far-IR galaxy LF thus appears similar in form
to that already established for active galactic nuclei, possibly reflecting a similar dependence
on the growth of galaxy mass.
