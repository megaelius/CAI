Predicting the rate of escape and thermal structure of Pluto's upper atmosphere in preparation
for the New Horizons Spacecraft encounter in 2015 is important for planning and interpreting the
expected measurements. Having a moderate Jeans parameter Pluto's atmosphere does not fit the classic
definition of Jeans escape for light species escaping from the terrestrial planets, nor does it
fit the hydrodynamic outflow from comets and certain exoplanets. It has been proposed for some time
that Pluto lies in the region of slow hydrodynamic escape. Using a hybrid fluid/molecular-kinetic
model, we previously demonstrated the typical implementation of this model fails to correctly
describe the appropriate temperature structure for the upper atmosphere for solar minimum conditions.
Here we use a time-dependent solver to allow us to extend those simulations to higher heating rates
and we examine fluid models in which Jeans-like escape expressions are used for the upper boundary
conditions. We compare these to hybrid simulations of the atmosphere under heating conditions
roughly representative of solar minimum and mean conditions as these bracket conditions expected
during the New Horizon encounter. Although we find escape rates comparable to those previously
estimated by the slow hydrodynamic escape model, and roughly consistent with energy limited escape,
our model produces a much more extended atmosphere with higher temperatures roughly consistent
with recent observations of CO. Such an extended atmosphere will be affected by Charon and will affect
Pluto's interaction with the solar wind at the New Horizon encounter. Since we have previously shown
that such models can be scaled, these results have implications for modeling exoplanet atmospheres
for which the energy limited escape approximation is often used.
