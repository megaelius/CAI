Using high-resolution (sub-kiloparsec scale) submillimeter data obtained by ALMA, we analyze
the star formation rate (SFR), gas content and kinematics in SDP 81, a gravitationally-lensed star-forming
galaxy at redshift 3. We estimate the SFR surface density ($\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$) in the brightest
clump of this galaxy to be $357^{+135}_{-85}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}\,kpc^{-2}}$, over
an area of $0.07\pm0.02\,\mathrm{kpc}^2$. Using the intensity-weighted velocity of CO$\,$(5-4),
we measure the turbulent velocity dispersion in the plane-of-the-sky and find $\sigma_{\mathrm{v,turb}}
= 37\pm5\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ for the star-forming clump, in good agreement with previous estimates
along the line of sight. Our measurements of gas surface density, freefall time and turbulent Mach
number reveal that the role of turbulence is vital to explaining the observed SFR in this clump. While
the Kennicutt Schmidt (KS) relation predicts a SFR surface density of $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR,KS}}
= 52\pm17\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}\,kpc^{-2}}$, the single-freefall model by Krumholz,
Dekel and McKee (KDM) predicts $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR,KDM}} = 106\pm37\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}\,kpc^{-2}}$.
In contrast, the multi-freefall (turbulence) model by Salim, Federrath and Kewley (SFK) gives
$\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR,SFK}} = 491^{+139}_{-194}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}\,kpc^{-2}}$.
Although the SFK relation overestimates the SFR in this clump (possibly due to the ignorance of magnetic
field), it provides the best prediction among the available models. Finally, we compare the star
formation and gas properties of this high-redshift galaxy to local star-forming regions and find
that the SFK relation provides the best estimates of SFR in both local and high-redshift galaxies.
