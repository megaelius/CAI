We investigate the effects of mass loss during the main-sequence (MS) and post-MS phases on the final
black hole (BH) masses of massive stars. We compute solar metallicity Geneva stellar evolution
models of an 85 $M_\odot$ star with mass-loss rate ($M_\odot$) prescriptions for MS and post-MS
phases. Such models could lead to massive BHs such as the recently detected 70 $M_\odot$ BH in the
LB-1 system. Based on the observational constraints for $M_\odot$ of luminous stars, we discuss
two possible scenarios that could produce such a massive BH at high metallicity. First, if the progenitor
of LB-1 evolved from the observed population of WNh stars, we show that its average mass loss rate
during its post-MS evolution was less than $1\,\times10^{-5}\,M_\odot/$yr. However, this is
lower than the typical observed mass-loss rates of LBVs. A second possibility is that the progenitor
evolved from a yet undetected population of 80-85~\msun\ stars with strong surface magnetic fields,
which could quench mass loss during the MS evolution. In this case, the average mass-loss rate during
the post-MS luminous blue variable (LBV) phase has to be less than $5\,\times10^{-5}\,M_\odot/$yr.
This value is still low, considering that LBVs such as AG Carinae typically have average mass-loss
rates from quiescent stellar winds close or above this level. LBVs directly collapsing to massive
BHs are apparently at odds with the evidence that LBVs are the direct progenitors of some supernovae
(SNe). To reconcile this, we suggest that LBVs from single stars (or mergers that fully mixed) have
large cores and form BHs, while binary LBVs may have smaller cores and larger envelopes (either mergers
or mass gainers that do not fully mix) and could produce a SN.
