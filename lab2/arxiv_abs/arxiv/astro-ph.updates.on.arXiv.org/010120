We present extensive ground-based and $Hubble~Space~Telescope$ ($HST$) photometry of the highly
reddened, very nearby type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2014J in M82, covering the phases from 9 days before
to about 900 days after the $B$-band maximum. SN 2014J is similar to other normal SNe Ia near the maximum
light, but it shows flux excess in the $B$ band in the early nebular phase. This excess flux emission
can be due to light scattering by some structures of circumstellar materials located at a few 10$^{17}$
cm, consistent with a single degenerate progenitor system or a double degenerate progenitor system
with mass outflows in the final evolution or magnetically driven winds around the binary system.
At t$\sim$+300 to $\sim$+500 days past the $B$-band maximum, the light curve of SN 2014J shows a faster
decline relative to the $^{56}$Ni decay. Such a feature can be attributed to the significant weakening
of the emission features around [Fe III] $\lambda$4700 and [Fe II] $\lambda$5200 rather than the
positron escape as previously suggested. Analysis of the $HST$ images taken at t$>$600 days confirms
that the luminosity of SN 2014J maintains a flat evolution at the very late phase. Fitting the late-time
pseudo-bolometric light curve with radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni, $^{57}$Ni and $^{55}$Fe isotopes,
we obtain the mass ratio $^{57}$Ni/$^{56}$Ni as $0.035 \pm 0.011$, which is consistent with the
corresponding value predicted from the 2D and 3D delayed-detonation models. Combined with early-time
analysis, we propose that delayed-detonation through single degenerate scenario is most likely
favored for SN 2014J.
