The merger of a neutron star (NS) binary may result in the formation of a long-lived, or indefinitely
stable, millisecond magnetar remnant surrounded by a low-mass ejecta shell. A portion of the magnetar's
prodigious rotational energy is deposited behind the ejecta in a pulsar wind nebula, powering luminous
optical/X-ray emission for hours to days following the merger. Ions in the pulsar wind may also be
accelerated to ultra-high energies, providing a coincident source of high energy cosmic rays and
neutrinos. At early times, the cosmic rays experience strong synchrotron losses; however, after
a day or so, pion production through photomeson interaction with thermal photons in the nebula comes
to dominate. The pion products initially suffer from synchrotron cooling themselves, but after
a few days have sufficient time to decay into energetic leptons and high-energy neutrinos. After
roughly a week, the density of background photons decreases sufficiently for cosmic rays to escape
the source without secondary production. These competing effects result in a neutrino light curve
that peaks on a few day timescale near an energy of $\sim10^{18}$ eV. This signal may be detectable
for individual mergers out to $\sim$ 10 Mpc by the IceCube Observatory (or up to 100 Mpc by next-generation
neutrino telescopes), providing clear evidence for a long-lived NS remnant, the presence of which
may otherwise be challenging to identify from the gravitational waves alone. Under the optimistic
assumption that a sizable fraction of NS mergers produce long-lived magnetars, the cumulative
cosmological neutrino background is estimated to be $\sim 10^{-8}\,\rm GeV\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}$
for a NS merger rate of $10^{-7}\,\rm Mpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}$ (depending also on the magnetar's dipole
field strength), overlapping with IceCube's current sensitivity and within the reach of next-generation
neutrino telescopes.
