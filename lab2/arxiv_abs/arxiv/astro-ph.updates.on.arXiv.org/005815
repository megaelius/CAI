Spatially resolved HI studies of dwarf galaxies have provided a wealth of precision data. However
these high-quality, resolved observations are only possible for handful of dwarf galaxies in the
Local Volume. Future HI surveys are unlikely to improve the current situation. We therefore explore
a method for estimating the surface density of the atomic gas from global HI parameters, which are
conversely widely available. We perform empirical tests using galaxies with resolved HI maps,
and find that our approximation produces values for the surface density of atomic hydrogen within
typically 0.5dex of the true value. We apply this method to a sample of 147 galaxies drawn from modern
near-infrared stellar photometric surveys. With this sample we confirm a strict correlation between
the atomic gas surface density and the star formation rate surface density, that is vertically offset
from the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation by a factor of 10-30, and significantly steeper than the classical
N=1.4 of Kennicutt (1998). We further infer the molecular fraction in the sample of low surface brightness,
predominantly dwarf galaxies by assuming that the star formation relationship with molecular
gas observed for spiral galaxies also holds in these galaxies, finding a molecular-to-atomic gas
mass fraction within the range of 5-15%. Comparison of the data to available models shows that a model
in which the thermal pressure balances the vertical gravitational field captures better the shape
of the $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}-\Sigma_{\rm gas}$ relationship. However, such models fail to reproduce
the data completely, suggesting that thermal pressure plays an important role in the disks of dwarf
galaxies.
