We describe the afterglows of long GRBs within the context of a binary-driven hypernova (BdHN).
In this paradigm afterglows originate from the interaction between a newly born neutron star (vNS),
created by an Ic supernova (SN), and a mildly relativistic ejecta of a hypernova (HN). Such a HN in
turn results from the impact of the GRB on the original SN Ic. The mildly relativistic expansion velocity
of the afterglow ($\Gamma$~3) is determined, using our model indipendent approach, from the thermal
emission between 196s and 461s. The observed power-law afterglow in the optical and X-ray bands
is shown to arise from the synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons in the expanding magnetized
HN ejecta. Two components contribute to the injected energy: the kinetic energy of the mildly relativistic
expanding HN and the rotational energy of the fast rotating highly magnetized vNS. As an example
we reproduce the observed afterglow of GRB130427A [...]. Initially, the emission is dominated
by the loss of kinetic energy of the HN component. After $10^5$s the emission is dominated by the loss
of rotational energy of the vNS, for which we adopt an initial rotation period of 2ms and a dipole/quadrupole
magnetic field of $\lesssim7x10^{12}$G/~$10^{14}$G. This approach opens new views on the roles
of the GRB interaction with the SN ejecta, on the mildly relativistic kinetic energy of the HN and
on the pulsar-like phenomena of the vNS. This scenario differs from the current ultra-relativistic
treatments of the afterglows and is consistent with the current observations of the mildly relativistic
expansions determined in a model independent approach in the Hard X-ray flares (HXFs), extended
thermal emission (ETE), soft X-ray flares (SXFs) and flare-plateau-afterglow (FPA) phase in the
BdHN, as well as of the thermal emission between 196s and 461s first presented in this paper.
