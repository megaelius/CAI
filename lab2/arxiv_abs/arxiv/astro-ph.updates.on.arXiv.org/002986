The mergers of galaxy clusters are the most energetic events in the universe after the Big Bang. With
the increased availability of multi-object spectroscopy and X-ray data an ever increasing fraction
of local clusters are recognised as exhibiting signs of recent or past merging events on various
scales. Our goal is to probe how these mergers affect the evolution and content of their member galaxies.
We specifically aim to answer the following questions: Is the quenching of star formation in merging
clusters enhanced when compared with relaxed clusters? Is the quenching preceded by a (short lived)
burst of star formation? We obtained optical spectroscopy of >400 galaxies in the field of the merging
cluster Abell 520. We combine these observations with archival data to get a comprehensive picture
of the state of star formation in the members of this merging cluster. Finally, we compare these observations
with a control sample of 10 non-merging clusters at the same redshift from The Arizona Cluster Redshift
Survey (ACReS). We split the member galaxies in passive, star forming or recently quenched depending
on their spectra. The core of the merger shows a decreased fraction of star forming galaxies compared
to clusters in the non-merging sample. This region, dominated by passive galaxies, is extended
along the axis of the merger. We find evidence of rapid quenching of the galaxies during the core passage
with no signs of a star burst on the time scales of the merger (~0.4Gyr). Additionally, we report the
tentative discovery of an infalling group along the main filament feeding the merger, currently
at ~2.5 Mpc from the merger centre. This group contains a high fraction of star forming galaxies as
well as ~2/3 of all the recently quenched galaxies in our survey.
