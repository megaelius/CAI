We present the three-dimensional numerical simulation of jets modeled with Relativistic Radiation
Hydrodynamics (RRH), that evolve across two environments: i) a stratified surrounding medium
and ii) a 16TI progenitor model. We consider opacities consistent with various processes of interaction
between the fluid and radiation, specifically, free-free, bound-free, bound-bound and electron
scattering. We explore various initial conditions, with different radiation energy densities
of the beam in hydrodynamical and radiation pressure dominated scenarios, considering only ultra-relativistic
jets. In order to investigate the impact of the radiation field on the evolution of the jets, we compare
our results with purely hydrodynamical jets. Comparing among jets driven by RRH, we find that radiation
pressure dominated jets propagate slightly faster than gas pressure dominated ones. Finally,
we construct the luminosity Light Curves (LCs) associated with all these cases. The construction
of LCs uses the fluxes of the radiation field which is fully coupled to the hydrodynamics equations
during the evolution. The main properties of the jets propagating on the stratified surrounding
medium are that the LCs show the same order of magnitude as the gamma-ray luminosity of typical Long
Gamma-Ray Bursts $10^{50}-10^{54}$erg/s and the difference between the radiation and gas temperatures
is of nearly one order of magnitude. The properties of jets breaking out from the progenitor star
model are that the LCs are of the order of magnitude of low-luminosity GRBs $10^{46}-10^{49}$ erg/s,
and in this scenario the difference between the gas and radiation temperature is of four orders of
magnitude, which is a case far from thermal equilibrium.
