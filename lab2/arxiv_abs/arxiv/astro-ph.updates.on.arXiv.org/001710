We present a new set of synthesis models for stellar populations obtained with Starburst99, which
are based on new stellar evolutionary tracks with rotation. We discuss models with zero rotation
velocity and with velocities of 40% of the break-up velocity on the zero-age main-sequence. These
values are expected to bracket realistic rotation velocity distributions in stellar populations.
The new rotating models for massive stars are more luminous and hotter due to a larger convective
core and enhanced surface abundances. This results in pronounced changes in the integrated spectral
energy distribution of a population containing massive stars. The changes are most significant
at the shortest wavelengths where an increase of the ionizing luminosity by up to a factor of 5 is predicted.
We also show that high equivalent widths of recombination lines may not necessarily indicate a very
young age but can be achieved at ages as late as 10 Myr. Comparison of these two boundary cases (0 and
40% of the break-up velocity) will allow users to evaluate the effects of rotation and provide guidance
for calibrating the stellar evolution models. We also introduce a new theoretical ultraviolet
spectral library built from the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) atmospheres. Its purpose is to help identify
signatures of Wolf-Rayet stars in the ultraviolet whose strength is sensitive to the particulars
of the evolution models. The new models are available for solar and 1/7th solar metallicities. A
complete suite of models can be generated on the Starburst99 website (www.stsci.edu/science/starburst99/).
The updated Starburst99 package can be retrieved from this website as well.
