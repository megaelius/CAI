The Shapley Concentration ($z\approx0.048$) covers several degrees in the Southern Hemisphere,
and includes galaxy clusters in advanced evolutionary stage, groups of clusters in the early stages
of merger, fairly massive clusters with ongoing accretion activity, and smaller groups located
in filaments in the regions between the main clusters. With the goal to investigate the role of cluster
mergers and accretion on the radio galaxy population, we performed a multi-wavelength study of
the BCGs and of the galaxies showing extended radio emission in the cluster complexes of Abell 3528
and Abell 3558. Our study is based on a sample of 12 galaxies. We observed the clusters with the GMRT
at 235, 325 and 610 MHz, and with the VLA at 8.46 GHz. We complemented our study with the TGSS at 150 MHz,
the SUMSS at 843 MHz and ATCA at 1380, 1400, 2380, and 4790 MHz data. Optical imaging with ESO-VST and
mid-IR coverage with WISE are also available for the host galaxies. We found deep differences in
the properties of the radio emission of the BCGs in the two cluster complexes. The BCGs in the A3528
complex and in A3556, which are relaxed cool-core objects, are powerful active radio galaxies.
They also present hints of restarted activity. On the contrary, the BCGs in A3558 and A3562, which
are well known merging systems, are very faint, or quiet, in the radio band. The optical and IR properties
of the galaxies are fairly similar in the two complexes, showing all passive red galaxies. Our study
shows remarkable differences in the radio properties of the BGCs, which we relate to the different
dynamical state of the host cluster. On the contrary, the lack of changes between such different
environments in the optical band suggests that the dynamical state of galaxy clusters does not affect
the optical counterparts of the radio galaxies, at least over the life-time of the radio emission.
