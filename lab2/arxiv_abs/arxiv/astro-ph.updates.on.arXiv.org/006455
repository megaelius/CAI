We present an analysis of the structure of post-starburst (PSB) galaxies in the redshift range $0.5
< z < 2$, using a photometrically-selected sample identified in the Ultra Deep Survey (UDS) field.
We examine the structure of $\sim80$ of these transient galaxies using radial light $\mu(r)$ profiles
obtained from CANDELS $\textit{Hubble Space Telescope}$ near-infrared/optical imaging, and
compare to a large sample of $\sim2000$ passive and star-forming galaxies. For each population,
we determine their typical structural properties (effective radius $r_{\rm e}$, S\'ersic index
$n$) and find significant differences in PSB structure at different epochs. At high redshift ($z
> 1$), PSBs are typically massive ($M_* > 10^{10}\rm\,M_{\odot}$), very compact and exhibit high
S\'ersic indices, with structures that differ significantly from their star-forming progenitors
but are similar to massive passive galaxies. In contrast, at lower redshift ($0.5 < z < 1$), PSBs are
generally of low mass ($M_* < 10^{10}\rm\,M_{\odot}$) and exhibit compact but less concentrated
profiles (i.e. lower S\'ersic indices), with structures similar to low-mass passive discs. Furthermore,
for both epochs we find remarkably consistent PSB structure across the optical/near-infrared
wavebands (which largely trace different stellar populations), suggesting that any preceding
starburst and/or quenching in PSBs was not strongly centralized. Taken together, these results
imply that PSBs at $z > 1$ have been recently quenched during a major disruptive event (e.g. merger
or protogalactic collapse) which formed a compact remnant, while at $z < 1$ an alternative less disruptive
process is primarily responsible. Our results suggest that high-$z$ PSBs are an intrinsically
different population to those at lower redshifts, and indicate different quenching routes are
active at different epochs.
