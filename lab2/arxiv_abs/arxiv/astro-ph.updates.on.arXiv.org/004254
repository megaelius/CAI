${\bf Aim:}$ To test the hypothesis that radiation pressure from star clusters acting on dust is
the dominant feedback agent disrupting the largest star-forming molecular clouds and thus regulating
the star-formation process. ${\bf Methods:}$ We perform multi-frequency, 3D, RT calculations
including scattering, absorption, and re-emission to longer wavelengths for clouds with masses
of $10^4$-$10^7\,$M$_{\odot}$, with embedded clusters and a star formation efficiencies of 0.009%-91%,
and varying maximum grain sizes up to 200$\,\mu$m. We calculate the ratio between radiative force
and gravity to determine whether radiation pressure can disrupt clouds. ${\bf Results:}$ We find
that radiation acting on dust almost never disrupts star-forming clouds. UV and optical photons
to which the cloud is optically thick do not scatter much. Instead, they quickly get absorbed and
re-emitted by at thermal wavelengths. As the cloud is typically optically thin to far-IR radiation,
it promptly escapes, depositing little momentum. The resulting spectrum is more narrowly peaked
than the corresponding Planck function with an extended tail at longer wavelengths. As the opacity
drops significantly across the sub-mm and mm, the resulting radiative force is even smaller than
for the corresponding single-temperature black body. The force from radiation pressure falls
below the strength of gravitational attraction by an order of magnitude or more for either Milky
Way or starbust conditions. For unrealistically large maximum grain sizes, and star formation
efficiencies far exceeding 50% do we find that the strength of radiation pressure can exceed gravity.
${\bf Conclusions:}$ We conclude that radiation pressure acting on dust does not disrupt star-forming
molecular clouds in any Local Group galaxies. Radiation pressure thus appears unlikely to regulate
the star-formation process on either local or global scales.
