Transmission spectroscopy during planetary transits, which is based on the measurements of the
variations of planet-to-star radius ratio as a function of wavelength, is a powerful technique
to study the atmospheric properties of transiting planets. One of the main limitation of this technique
is the effects of stellar activity, which up until now, have been taken into account only by assessing
the effect of non-occulted stellar spots on the estimates of planet-to-star radius ratio. In this
paper, we study, for the first time, the impact of the occultation of a stellar spot and plage on the
transmission spectra of transiting exoplanets. We simulated this effect by generating a large
number of transit light curves for different transiting planets, stellar spectral types, and for
different wavelengths. Results of our simulations indicate that the anomalies inside the transit
light curve can lead to a significant underestimation or overestimation of the planet-to-star
radius ratio as a function of wavelength. At short wavelengths, the effect can reach to a difference
of up to 10% in the planet-to-star radius ratio, mimicking the signature of light scattering in the
planetary atmosphere. Atmospheric scattering has been proposed to interpret the increasing slopes
of transmission spectra toward blue for exoplanets HD 189733b and GJ 3470b. Here we show that these
signatures can be alternatively interpreted by the occultation of stellar plages. Results also
suggest that the best strategy to identify and quantify the effects of stellar activities on the
transmission spectrum of a planet is to perform several observations during the transit epoch at
the same wavelength. This will allow for identifying the possible variations in transit depth as
a function of time due to stellar activity variability.
