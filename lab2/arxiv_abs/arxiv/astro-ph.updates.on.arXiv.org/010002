Magnetic reconnection is often invoked to explain the non-thermal radiation of relativistic outflows,
including jets of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Motivated by the largely unknown plasma composition
of AGN jets, we study reconnection in the unexplored regime of electron-positron-proton (pair-proton)
plasmas with large-scale two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. We cover a wide range
of pair multiplicities (lepton-to-proton number ratio $\kappa=1-199$) for different values
of the all-species plasma magnetization ($\sigma=1,3$ and 10) and electron temperature ($\Theta_e\equiv
kT_e/m_ec^2=0.1-100$). We focus on the dependence of the post-reconnection energy partition
and lepton energy spectra on the hot pair plasma magnetization $\sigma_{e,h}$ (i.e., the ratio
of magnetic to pair enthalpy densities). We find that the post-reconnection energy is shared roughly
equally between magnetic fields, pairs, and protons for $\sigma_{e,h}\gtrsim 3$. We empirically
find that the mean lepton Lorentz factor in the post-reconnection region depends on $\sigma, \Theta_e$,
and $\sigma_{e,h}$ as $\langle \gamma_e-1\rangle \approx \sqrt{\sigma}(1+4\Theta_e)\left(1+\sigma_{e,h}/30\right)$,
for $\sigma\ge1$. The high-energy part of the post-reconnection lepton energy distributions
can be described by a power law, whose slope is mainly controlled by $\sigma_{e,h}$ for $\kappa \gtrsim
3-6$, with harder power laws obtained for higher magnetizations. We finally show that reconnection
in pair-proton plasmas with multiplicities $\kappa \sim 1-20$, magnetizations $\sigma \sim 1-10$,
and temperatures $\Theta_e \sim 1-10$ results in particle power law slopes and average electron
Lorentz factors that are consistent with those inferred in leptonic models of AGN jet emission.
