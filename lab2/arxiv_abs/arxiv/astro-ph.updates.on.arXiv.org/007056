We present Lampray: a multi-group long characteristics ray tracing method for adaptive mesh radiation
hydrodynamics in the Ramses code. It avoids diffusion, captures shadows, and treats colliding
beams correctly, and therefore complements existing moment-based ray tracing in Ramses. Lampray
includes different options for interpolation between ray and cell domain, and use either integral,
Fourier, or an implicit method for hydrogen ionization to solve the radiative transfer. The opacity
can either be tabulated or computed through a coupling to the general non-equilibrium astro-chemistry
framework Krome. We use an H-He-C-O network with 36 species and 240 reactions to track the photo-chemistry
in the interstellar medium across 6 and 10 orders of magnitude in temperature and density. Self-shielding
prescriptions for H$_2$ and CO are used together with a new model for the diffuse interstellar UV-field.
We also track the dust temperature, formation of H$_2$ on grains, and H$_2$O and CO ices in detail.
Lampray is tested against standard benchmarks for molecular cloud and star formation simulations,
including the formation of a Str\"omgren sphere, the expansion of an ionization front, the photo-evaporation
of a dense clump, and the H-He-C-O chemistry in a static photo-dissociation front. Efficient parallelisation
is achieved with a separate domain decomposition for rays where points along a ray reside in the same
memory space, and data movement from cell- to ray-domain is done with a direct hash-table lookup
algorithm. Point sources are treated without splitting rays, and therefore the method currently
only scales to a few point sources, while diffuse radiation has excellent scaling.
