We investigate the optical properties of Ophiuchus to obtain clues on the formation epoch of this
cluster, and compare them to those of the Coma cluster, which is comparable in mass to Ophiuchus but
much more disturbed dynamically. Based on a deep image of the Ophiuchus cluster in the r' band obtained
at the Canada France Hawaii Telescope with the MegaCam camera, we have applied an iterative process
to subtract the contribution of the numerous stars that pollute the image, due to the low Galactic
latitude of the cluster, and obtained a photometric catalogue of 2818 galaxies fully complete at
r'=20.5 mag and still 91% complete at r'=21.5 mag. We use this catalogue to derive the cluster Galaxy
Luminosity Function (GLF) for the overall image and for a region (hereafter the "rectangle" region)
covering exactly the same physical size as the region in which the GLF of the Coma cluster was studied
by Adami et al. (2007). We then compute density maps based on an adaptive kernel technique, for different
magnitude limits, and define three circular regions covering 0.08, 0.08 and 0.06 deg^2 respectively
centered on the cluster (C), northwest (NW) and southeast (SE) of the cluster, in which we compute
the GLFs. The GLF fits are much better when a Gaussian is added to the usual Schechter function, to
account for the excess of very bright galaxies. Compared to Coma, Ophiuchus shows a strong excess
of bright galaxies. The properties of the two nearby very massive clusters Ophiuchus and Coma are
quite comparable, though they seem embedded in different large scale environments. Our interpretation
is that Ophiuchus has built up long ago, as confirmed by its relaxed state (see paper I) while Coma
is still in the process of forming.
