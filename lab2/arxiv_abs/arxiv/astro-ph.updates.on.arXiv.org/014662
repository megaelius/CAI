A crucial problem for part-sky analysis of CMB polarization is the $E$-$B$ leakage problem. Such
leakage arises from the presence of 'ambiguous' modes that satisfy properties of both $E$ and $B$
modes. Solving this problem is critical for primordial polarization $B$ mode detection in part-sky
CMB polarization experiments. In this work we introduce a new method for reducing the leakage. We
demonstrate that if we complement the $E$-mode information outside the observation patch with
ancillary data from full-sky CMB observations, we can reduce and even effectively remove the $E$-to-$B$
leakage. For this objective, we produce $E$-mode Stokes $QU$ maps from Wiener filtered full-sky
intensity and polarization CMB observations. We use these maps to fill the sky region that is not
observed by the ground-based experiment of interest, and thus complement the part-sky Stokes $QU$
maps. Since the $E$-mode information is now available on the full sky we see a significant reduction
in the $E$-to-$B$ leakage. We evaluate on simulated data sets the performance of our method for a
`shallow' $f_\text{sky}=8\%$, and a `deep' $f_\text{sky}=2\%$ northern hemisphere sky patch,
with AliCPT-like properties, by combining those observations with Planck-like full sky polarization
maps. We find that our method outperforms the standard and the pure-$B$ method pseudo-$C_\ell$
estimators for all of our simulations. Our new method gives unbiased estimates of the $B$-mode power
spectrum with near-optimal errors. We also study the application of our method to the CMB-S4 experiment
combined with LiteBIRD-like full sky data, and show that using signal-dominated full sky $E$-mode
data we can eliminate the $E$-to-$B$ leakage problem.
