We report the identification of an unusual absorption line system in the quasar SDSS J080248.18$+$551328.9
and present a detailed study of the system, incorporating follow-up optical and NIR spectroscopy.
A few tens of absorption lines are detected, including He I*, Fe II* and Ni II* that arise from metastable
or excited levels, as well as resonant lines in Mg I, Mg II, Fe II, Mn II, and Ca II. All of the isolated
absorption lines show the same profile of width $\Delta v\sim 1,500$km s$^{-1}$ centered at a common
redshift as that of the quasar emission lines, such as [O II], [S II], and hydrogen Paschen and Balmer
series. With narrow Balmer lines, strong optical Fe II multiplets, and weak [O III] doublets, its
emission line spectrum is typical for that of a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy (NLS1). We have derived
reliable measurements of the gas-phase column densities of the absorbing ions/levels. Photoionization
modeling indicates that the absorber has a density of $n_{\rm H} \sim (1.0-2.5)\times 10^5~ {\rm
cm}^{-3}$ and a column density of $N_{\rm H} \sim (1.0-3.2)\times 10^{21} \sim {\rm cm}^{-2}$,
and is located at $R\sim100-250$ pc from the central super-massive black hole. The location of the
absorber, the symmetric profile of the absorption lines, and the coincidence of the absorption
and emission line centroid jointly suggest that the absorption gas is originated from the host galaxy
and is plausibly accelerated by stellar processes, such as stellar winds \zhy{and/or} supernova
explosions. The implications for the detection of such a peculiar absorption line system in an NLS1
are discussed in the context of co-evolution between super-massive black hole growth and host galaxy
build-up.
