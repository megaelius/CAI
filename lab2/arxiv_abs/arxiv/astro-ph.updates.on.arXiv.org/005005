The ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Reticulum II was enriched by a rare and prolific r-process event, such
as a neutron star merger. To investigate the nature of this event, we present high-resolution Magellan/MIKE
spectroscopy of the brightest star in this galaxy. The high signal-to-noise allows us to determine
the abundances of 41 elements, including the radioactive actinide element Th and first ever detections
of third r-process peak elements (Os and Ir) in a star outside the Milky Way. The observed neutron-capture
element abundances closely match the solar r-process component, except for the first r-process
peak which is significantly lower than solar but matches other r-process enhanced stars. The ratio
of first peak to heavier r-process elements implies the r-process site produces roughly equal masses
of high and low electron fraction ejecta, within a factor of 2. We compare the detailed abundance
pattern to predictions from nucleosynthesis calculations of neutron star mergers and magneto-rotationally
driven jet supernovae, finding that nuclear physics uncertainties dominate over astrophysical
uncertainties. We measure $\log\mbox{Th/Eu} = -0.84 \pm 0.06\,\text{(stat)} \pm 0.22\,\text{(sys)}$,
somewhat lower than all previous Th/Eu observations. The youngest age we derive from this ratio
is $21.7 \pm 2.8\,\text{(stat)} \pm 10.3\,\text{(sys)}$ Gyr, indicating that current initial
production ratios do not well describe the r-process event in Reticulum II. The abundance of light
elements up to Zn are consistent with extremely metal-poor Milky Way halo stars. They may eventually
provide a way to distinguish between neutron star mergers and magneto-rotationally driven jet
supernovae, but this would require more detailed knowledge of the chemical evolution of Reticulum
II.
