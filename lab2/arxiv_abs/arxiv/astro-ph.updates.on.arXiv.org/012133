Protoplanetary discs are the site of star and planet formation, and their evolution and consequent
dispersal deeply affect the formation of planetary systems. In the standard scenario they evolve
on timescales ~Myr due to the viscous transport of angular momentum. The analytical self-similar
solution for their evolution predicts also specific disc isochrones in the accretion rate - disc
mass plane. However, photoevaporation by radiation emitted by the central star is likely to dominate
the gas disc dispersal of the innermost region, introducing another (shorter) timescale for this
process. In this paper, we include the effect of internal (X and EUV) photoevaporation on the disc
evolution, finding numerical solutions for a population of protoplanetary discs. Our models naturally
reproduce the expected quick dispersal of the inner region of discs when their accretion rates match
the rate of photoevaporative mass loss, in line with previous studies. We find that photoevaporation
preferentially removes the lightest discs in the sample. The net result is that, counter-intuitively,
photoevaporation increases the average disc mass in the sample, by dispersing the lightest discs.
At the same time, photoevaporation also reduces the mass accretion rate by cutting the supply of
material from the outer to the inner disc. In a purely viscous framework, this would be interpreted
as the result of a longer viscous evolution, leading to an overestimate of the disc age. Our results
thus show that photoevaporation is a necessary ingredient to include when interpreting observations
of large disc samples with measured mass accretion rates and disc masses. Photoevaporation leaves
a characteristic imprint on the shape of the isochrone. Accurate data in the accretion rate - disc
mass plane in the low disc mass region therefore give clues on the typical photoevaporation rate.
