The atmospheres of late M stars represent a significant challenge in the characterization of any
transiting exoplanets due to the presence of strong molecular features in the stellar atmosphere.
TRAPPIST-1 is an ultra-cool dwarf, host to seven transiting planets, and contains its own molecular
signatures which can potentially be imprinted on planetary transit lightcurves due to inhomogeneities
in the occulted stellar photosphere. We present a case study on TRAPPIST-1g, the largest planet
in the system, using a new observation together with previous data, to disentangle the atmospheric
transmission of the planet from that of the star. We use the out-of-transit stellar spectra to reconstruct
the stellar flux based on one-, two-, and three-temperature components. We find that TRAPPIST-1
is a 0.08 M$_*$, 0.117 R$_*$, M8V star with a photospheric effective temperature of 2400 K, with ~35%
3000 K spot coverage and a very small fraction, <3%, of ~5800 K hot spot. We calculate a planetary radius
for TRAPPIST-1g to be Rp = 1.124 R$_\oplus$ with a planetary density of $\rho_p$ = 0.8214 $\rho_\oplus$.
Based on the stellar reconstruction there are eleven plausible scenarios for the combined stellar
photosphere and planet transit geometry; in our analysis we are able to rule out 8 of the 11 scenarios.
Using planetary models we evaluate the remaining scenarios with respect to the transmission spectrum
of TRAPPIST-1g. We conclude that the planetary transmission spectrum is likely not contaminated
by any stellar spectral features, and are able to rule out a clear solar H2/He-dominated atmosphere
at greater than 3-sigma.
