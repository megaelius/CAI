Directly comparing the 6 expansion rate measured by type Ia supernovae data and the lower bound on
the expansion rate set by the strong energy conditions or the null hypothesis that there never exists
cosmic acceleration, we see $3\sigma$ direct evidence of cosmic acceleration and the $Rh=ct$ model
is strongly excluded by the type Ia supernovae data. We also use Gaussian process method to reconstruct
the expansion rate and the deceleration parameter from the 31 cosmic chronometers data and the 6
data points on the expansion rate measured from type Ia supernoave data, the direct evidence of cosmic
acceleration is more than $3\sigma$ and we find that the transition redshift $z_t=0.60_{-0.12}^{+0.21}$
at which the expansion of the Universe underwent the transition from acceleration to deceleration.
The Hubble constant inferred from the cosmic chronometers data with the Gaussian process method
is $H_0=67.46\pm4.75$ Km/s/Mpc. To understand the properties of cosmic acceleration and dark
energy, we fit two different two-parameter models to the observational data, and we find that the
constraints on the model parameters from either the full distance modulus data by the Pantheon compilation
or the compressed expansion rate data are very similar, and the derived Hubble constants are consistent
with the Planck 2018 result. Our results confirm that the 6 compressed expansion rate data can replace
the full 1048 distance modulus data from the Pantheon compilation. We derive the transition redshift
$z_t=0.61_{-0.16}^{+0.24}$ by fitting a simple $q(z)$ model to the combination of cosmic chronometers
data and the Pantheon compilation, the result is consistent with that obtained from the reconstruction
with Gaussian process. Abridged.
