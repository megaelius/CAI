The first quenched galaxies (z>2) are both the most massive, and most compact, suggesting a physical
connection between high stellar density and efficient, rapid cessation of star-formation. We
present rest-frame UV spectra of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at z~3 selected to be candidate progenitors
of the quenched galaxies at z~2, compared to other LBGs of similar mass and star-formation rate (non-candidates).
We find that candidate progenitors have faster outflow velocities and higher equivalent widths
of interstellar absorption lines, implying larger velocity spread among absorbing clouds. Candidates
deviate from the relationship between equivalent widths of Lyman-alpha and interstellar absorption
lines in that their Lyman-alpha emission remains strong despite high interstellar absorption,
possibly indicating that the neutral HI fraction is patchy, such that Lyman-alpha photons can escape.
We detect stronger CIV P-Cygni features (emission and absorption) and HeII emission in candidates,
indicative of larger populations of metal-rich Wolf-Rayet stars compared to non-candidates.
The faster outflows, broader spread of gas velocity, and Lyman-alpha properties of candidates
are consistent with their ISM being subject to more energetic feedback than non-candidates. Together
with their larger metallicity (implying more evolved star-formation activity) this leads us to
propose, if speculatively, that they are likely to quench sooner than non-candidates, supporting
the validity of selection criteria used to identify them as progenitors of z~2 passive galaxies.
We propose that massive, compact galaxies undergo more rapid growth of their stellar mass content,
perhaps because the gas accretion mechanisms are different, and quench sooner than normally-sized
LBGs at these (early) epochs.
