Aims: We explore the long-term evolution of young protoplanetary disks with different approaches
to computing the thermal structure determined by various cooling and heating processes in the disk
and its surroundings. Methods: Numerical hydrodynamics simulations in the thin-disk limit were
complemented with three thermal evolution schemes: a simplified $\beta$-cooling approach with
and without irradiation, in which the rate of disk cooling is proportional to the local dynamical
time, a fiducial model with equal dust and gas temperatures calculated taking viscous heating,
irradiation, and radiative cooling into account, and also a more sophisticated approach allowing
decoupled dust and gas temperatures. Results: We found that the gas temperature may significantly
exceed that of dust in the outer regions of young disks thanks to additional compressional heating
caused by the infalling envelope material in the early stages of disk evolution and slow collisional
exchange of energy between gas and dust in low-density disk regions. The outer envelope however
shows an inverse trend with the gas temperatures dropping below that of dust. The global disk evolution
is only weakly sensitive to temperature decoupling. Nevertheless, separate dust and gas temperatures
may affect the chemical composition, dust evolution, and disk mass estimates. Constant-$\beta$
models without stellar and background irradiation fail to reproduce the disk evolution with more
sophisticated thermal schemes because of intrinsically variable nature of the $\beta$-parameter.
Constant-$\beta$ models with irradiation can better match the dynamical and thermal evolution,
but the agreement is still incomplete. Conclusions: Models allowing separate dust and gas temperatures
are needed when emphasis is placed on the chemical or dust evolution in protoplanetary disks, particularly
in sub-solar metallicity environments.
