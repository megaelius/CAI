At low redshift, the majority of supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass estimates are obtained from
modeling stellar kinematics or ionized gas dynamics in the vicinity of the galaxy nucleus. For large
early type galaxies, stellar kinematics models predict higher masses than gas-dynamical models.
In the case of M87, this discrepancy is larger than 2 $\sigma$. Critical to gas-dynamical modeling
is the assumed underlying dynamical state of the gas: that it lies on circular Keplerian orbits,
potentially with some additional turbulent pressure support. This is inconsistent with models
of the gas flow about low-accretion-rate SMBHs and at odds with observations of the Galactic Center.
We present a simple model for non-Keplerian gas disks and explore their implications for SMBH mass
measurements. We show that a larger central black hole with gas experiencing small amounts of sub-Keplerian
motion can produce velocity curves similar to models that just contain circular Keplerian motions
and a lower black hole mass. However, these non-Keplerian models are distinguishable from low-mass
Keplerian models primarily through measurements of the velocity dispersion, wherein non-Keplerian
models produce higher and narrower peak dispersions. Away from the galaxy center, but still within
the circumnuclear gas disk, non-Keplerian models also become distinguishable from Keplerian
models via a shift in the velocity curve. The velocity model presented in this paper is capable of
resolving the discrepancy between the ionized gas dynamics and stellar kinematics mass estimates,
and is applicable to gas-dynamical mass estimates of SMBHs in general.
