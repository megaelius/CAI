Oscillations in solar prominences are a frequent phenomenon, and they have been the subject of many
studies. A full understanding of the mechanisms that drive them and their attenuation has not been
reached yet. We numerically investigate the periodicity and damping of transverse and longitudinal
oscillations in a 3D model of a curtain-shaped prominence. We carried out a set of numerical simulations
of vertical, transverse and longitudinal oscillations with the high-order finite-difference
Pencil Code. We solved the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations for a wide range of parameters,
including the width and density of the prominence, and the magnetic field strength (B) of the solar
corona. We studied the periodicity and attenuation of the induced oscillations. We found that longitudinal
oscillations can be fit with the pendulum model, whose restoring force is the field aligned component
of gravity, but other mechanisms such as pressure gradients may contribute to the movement. On the
other hand, transverse oscillations are subject to magnetic forces. The analysis of the parametric
survey shows, in agreement with observational studies, that the oscillation period (P) increases
with the prominence width. For transverse oscillations we obtained that P increases with density
and decreases with B. For longitudinal oscillations we also found that P increases with density,
but there are no variations with B. The attenuation of transverse oscillations was investigated
by analysing the velocity distribution and computing the Alfv\'en continuum modes. We conclude
that resonant absorption is the mean cause. Damping of longitudinal oscillations is due to some
kind of shear numerical viscosity.
