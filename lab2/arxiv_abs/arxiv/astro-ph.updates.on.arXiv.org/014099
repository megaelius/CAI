Pulsar timing experiments typically generate a phase-connected timing solution from a sequence
of times-of-arrival (TOAs) by absolute pulse numbering, i.e. by fitting an integer number of pulses
between TOAs in order to minimize the residuals with respect to a parametrized phase model. In this
observing mode, rotational glitches are discovered, when the residuals of the no-glitch phase
model diverge after some epoch, and glitch parameters are refined by Bayesian follow-up. Here an
alternative, complementary approach is presented which tracks the pulse frequency $f$ and its
time derivative $df/dt$ with a hidden Markov model (HMM), whose dynamics include stochastic spin
wandering (timing noise) and impulsive jumps in $f$ and $df/dt$ (glitches). The HMM tracks spin
wandering explicitly, as a specific realization of a discrete-time Markov chain. It discovers
glitches by comparing the Bayes factor for glitch and no-glitch models. It ingests standard TOAs
for convenience and, being fully automated, allows performance bounds to be calculated quickly
via Monte Carlo simulations. Practical, user-oriented plots are presented of the false alarm probability
and detection threshold (e.g. minimum resolvable glitch size) versus observational scheduling
parameters (e.g. TOA uncertainty, mean delay between TOAs) and glitch parameters (e.g. transient
and permanent jump sizes, exponential recovery time-scale). The HMM is also applied to $\sim 1$
yr of real data bracketing the 2016 December 12 glitch in PSR J0835-4510 as a proof of principle. It
detects the known glitch and confirms that no other glitch exists in the same data with size $> 10^{-7}
f$.
