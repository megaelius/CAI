Context. Observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) can be used to derive accurate cosmological
distances through empirical standardization techniques. Despite this success neither the progenitors
of SNe Ia nor the explosion process are fully understood. The U-band region has been less well observed
for nearby SNe, due to technical challenges, but is the most readily accessible band for high-redshift
SNe. Aims. Using spectrophotometry from the Nearby Supernova Factory, we study the origin and extent
of U-band spectroscopic variations in SNe Ia and explore consequences for their standardization
and the potential for providing new insights into the explosion process. Methods. We divide the
U-band spectrum into four wavelength regions {\lambda}(uNi), {\lambda}(uTi), {\lambda}(uSi)
and {\lambda}(uCa). Two of these span the Ca H&K {\lambda}{\lambda} 3934, 3969 complex. We employ
spectral synthesis using SYNAPPS to associate the two bluer regions with Ni/Co and Ti. Results.
(1) The flux of the uTi feature is an extremely sensitive temperature/luminosity indicator, standardizing
the SN peak luminosity to 0.116 $\pm$ 0.011 mag RMS. A traditional SALT2.4 fit on the same sample yields
a 0.135 mag RMS. Standardization using uTi also reduces the difference in corrected magnitude between
SNe originating from different host galaxy environments. (2) Early U-band spectra can be used to
probe the Ni+Co distribution in the ejecta, thus offering a rare window into the source of lightcurve
power. (3) The uCa flux further improves standardization, yielding a 0.086 $\pm$ 0.010 mag RMS without
the need to include an additional intrinsic dispersion to reach {\chi}$^2$/dof $\sim$ 1. This reduction
in RMS is partially driven by an improved standardization of Shallow Silicon and 91T-like SNe.
