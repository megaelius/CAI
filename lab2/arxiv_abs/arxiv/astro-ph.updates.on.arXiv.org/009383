Asteroid (6478) Gault was discovered to exhibit a comet-like tail in observations from December
2018, becoming a new member of the so-called active asteroid population in the main asteroid belt.
The aims are to investigate the grain properties of the dust ejected from asteroid (6478) Gault and
to give insight into the activity mechanism(s). We use a Monte Carlo dust tail brightness code to
retrieve the dates of dust ejection, the physical properties of the grains, and the total dust mass
losses during each event. The code takes into account the brightness contribution of the asteroid
itself. The model is applied to a large data set of images spanning the period from January 11, 2019
to March 13, 2019. In addition, both short- and long-term photometric measurements of the asteroid
have been carried out. It is shown that, to date, asteroid (6478) Gault has experienced two episodes
of impulsive dust ejection, that took place around 2018 November 5 and 2019 January 2, releasing
at least 1.4$\times$10$^7$ kg and 1.6 $\times$10$^6$ kg of dust, respectively, at escape speeds.
The size distribution, consisting of particles in the 1 $\mu$m to 1 cm radius range, follows a broken
power-law with bending points near 15 $\mu$m and 870 $\mu$m. On the other hand, the photometric series
indicate a nearly constant magnitude over several 5--7.3 h periods, a possible effect of the masking
of a rotational lightcurve by the dust. The dust particles forming Gault's tails were released from
the asteroid at escape speeds, but the specific ejection mechanism is unclear until photometry
of the dust-free asteroid are conducted, in order to assess whether this was related to rotational
disruption or to other possible causes.
