Until recently, symbiotic binary systems in which a white dwarf accretes from a red giant were thought
to be mainly a soft X-ray population. Here we describe the detection with the X-ray Telescope (XRT)
on the Swift satellite of nine white dwarf symbiotics that were not previously known to be X-ray sources
and one that had previously been detected as a supersoft X-ray source. The nine new X-ray detections
were the result of a survey of 41 symbiotic stars, and they increase the number of symbiotic stars
known to be X-ray sources by approximately 30%. The Swift/XRT telescope detected all of the new X-ray
sources at energies greater than 2 keV. Their X-ray spectra are consistent with thermal emission
and fall naturally into three distinct groups. The first group contains those sources with a single,
highly absorbed hard component that we identify as probably coming from an accretion-disk boundary
layer. The second group is composed of those sources with a single, soft X-ray spectral component
that probably originates in a region where low-velocity shocks produce X-ray emission, i.e., a
colliding-wind region. The third group consists of those sources with both hard and soft X-ray spectral
components. We also find that unlike in the optical, where rapid, stochastic brightness variations
from the accretion disk typically are not seen, detectable UV flickering is a common property of
symbiotic stars. Supporting our physical interpretation of the two X-ray spectral components,
simultaneous Swift UV photometry shows that symbiotic stars with harder X-ray emission tend to
have stronger UV flickering, which is usually associated with accretion through a disk. To place
these new observations in the context of previous work on X-ray emission from symbiotic star.............
