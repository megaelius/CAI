Recombination lines involving high principal quantum numbers populate the radio spectrum in large
numbers. Low-frequency (<1 GHz) observations of radio recombination lines (RRLs) primarily from
carbon and hydrogen offer a new, if not unique, way to probe cold, largely atomic gas and warm, ionised
gas in other galaxies. Furthermore, RRLs can be used to determine the physical state of the emitting
regions, such as temperature and density. These properties make RRLs, potentially, a powerful
tool of extragalactic ISM physics. At low radio frequencies, its conceivable to detect RRLs out
to cosmological distances when illuminated by a strong radio continuum. However, they are extremely
faint (tau ~ 1e-3 -- 1e-4) and have so far eluded detection outside of the local universe. With LOFAR
observations of the radio quasar 3C 190 (z=1.1946), we aim to demonstrate that the ISM can be explored
out to great distances through low-frequency RRLs. We report the detection of RRLs in the frequency
range 112--163 MHz in the spectrum of 3C 190. Stacking 13 a-transitions with principal quantum numbers
n=266-301, a peak 6sigma feature of optical depth, tau(peak) = (1.0 +\- 0.2) x 1e-3 and FWHM = 31.2
+/- 8.3 km/s was found at z=1.124. This corresponds to a velocity offset of -9965 km/s with respect
to the systemic redshift of 3C 190. We consider three interpretations of the origin of the RRL emission:
an intervening dwarf-like galaxy, an AGN-driven outflow, and the inter-galactic medium. We argue
that the RRLs most likely originate in a dwarf-like galaxy (M ~ 1e9 Msun) along the line of sight, although
we cannot rule out an AGN-driven outflow. We do find the RRLs to be inconsistent with an inter-galactic
medium origin. With this detection, we have opened up a new way to study the physical properties of
cool, diffuse gas out to cosmological distances.
