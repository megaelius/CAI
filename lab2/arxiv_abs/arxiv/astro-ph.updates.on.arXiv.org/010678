Using a sample of 70 924 stars from the second data release of the GALAH optical spectroscopic survey,
we construct median sequences of [X/Mg] vs. [Mg/H] for 21 elements, separating the low-Ia (high-$\alpha$)
and high-Ia (low-$\alpha$) stellar populations based on cuts in [Mg/Fe]. Previous work with the
near-IR APOGEE survey has shown that such sequences are nearly independent of location in the Galactic
disk, which implies that they are determined by stellar nucleosynthesis yields with little sensitivity
to other aspects of chemical evolution. The separation between the low-Ia and high-Ia [X/Mg] sequences
indicates the relative importance of prompt and delayed enrichment mechanisms (e.g., core collapse
supernovae vs. SNIa or AGB stars), while the slopes of the sequences indicate metallicity dependence
of the corresponding yields. GALAH and APOGEE measurements agree fairly well for some of the elements
they have in common (Si, Mn, Cr, Fe, Ni), but they differ in sequence separation or metallicity trends
for others (O, Ca, Na, Al, K, V, Co). GALAH offers access to nine new elements. We infer that about $75\%$
of solar C comes from core collapse supernovae and $25\%$ from delayed mechanisms. We find core collapse
fractions of $60-80\%$ for the Fe-peak elements Sc, Ti, Cu, and Zn, with strong metallicity dependence
of the core collapse Cu yield. For the neutron capture elements Y, Ba, and La, we infer large delayed
contributions with, non-monotonic metallicity dependence. The separation of the [Eu/Mg] sequences
implies that at least $\sim30\%$ of Eu enrichment is significantly delayed with respect to star
formation. We compare our results to predictions of several supernova and AGB yield models; C, Na,
K, Mn, and Ca all show discrepancies with one or more models that could make them useful diagnostics
of nucleosynthesis physics.
