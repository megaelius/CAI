A five-dimensional interpolation method and corresponding computer program are developed for
using published calculations to determine the non-LTE correction {\Delta\}NLTE to the lithium
abundance log{\epsilon}(Li) derived from the Li I 6707.8 {\AA} line. The {\Delta\}NLTE values
is determined from the following five parameters: {\Delta\}NLTE the effective temperature Teff,
the acceleration of gravity logg, the metallicity index [Fe/H], the microturbulent velocity Vt,
and the LTE Li abundance log {\epsilon}(Li). The program is used to calculate values of {\Delta\}NLTE
and the non-LTE Li abundance for 91 single bright giants from the list of Lebre, et al. By combining
these results with data for 55 stars, we obtain the non-LTE values of log {\epsilon}(Li) for 146 FGK-giants
and supergiants. We confirm that, in the spectra of most of these stars, it is only possible to estimate
for them an upper limit for the Li abundance. A large spread is confirmed in log {\epsilon}(Li) for
stars with masses M<6Msun. A comparison of these results with model calculations of stars confirms
the unique sensitivity of the lithium abundance to the initial rotation velocity V0. We discuss
the giants and supergiants with lithium abundances log {\epsilon}(Li) = 1.4 +- 0.3, which could
have a rotation velocity V0=0 km/s and have already undergone deep convective mixing. Li-rich giants
with lithium abundances log {\epsilon}(Li)>2 and nearly up to the initial value of log {\epsilon}(Li)
= 3.2 +- 0.1 are examined. It is shown that the fraction of Li-rich giants with V0 = 0 - 50 km/s is consistent
with current evolutionary models. The other stars of this type, as well as all of the "super Li-rich"
giants, for which the standard theory is untenable, can be explained by invoking the hypothesis
of recent lithium synthesis in the star or an alternative hypothesis according to which a giant planet
is engulfed by the star.
