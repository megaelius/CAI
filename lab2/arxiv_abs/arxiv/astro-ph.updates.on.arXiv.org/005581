Aims. We develop, test and characterise of a new statistical tool (intelligent system) for the sifting
and analysis of nearby young open cluster (NYOC) populations. Methods. Using a Bayesian formalism,
this statistical tool is able to obtain the posterior distributions of parameters governing the
cluster model. It also uses hierarchical bayesian models to establish weakly informative priors,
and incorporates the treatment of missing values and non-homogeneous (heteroscedastic) observational
uncertainties. Results. From simulations, we estimate that this statistical tool renders kinematic
(proper motion) and photometric (luminosity) distributions of the cluster population with a contamination
rate of $5.8 \pm 0.2$ %. The luminosity distributions and present day mass function agree with the
ones found by Bouy et al. (2015b) on the completeness interval of the survey. At the probability threshold
of maximum accuracy, the classifier recovers $\sim$ 90% of Bouy et al. (2015b) candidate members
and finds 10% of new ones. Conclusions. A new statistical tool for the analysis of NYOC is introduced,
tested and characterised. Its comprehensive modelling of the data properties allows it to get rid
of the biases present in previous works. In particular, those resulting from the use of only completely
observed (non-missing) data and the assumption of homoskedastic uncertainties. Also, its Bayesian
framework allows it to properly propagate observational uncertainties into membership probabilities
and cluster velocity and luminosity distributions. Our results are in a general agreement with
those from the literature, although we provide the most up-to-date and extended list of candidate
members of the Pleiades cluster.
