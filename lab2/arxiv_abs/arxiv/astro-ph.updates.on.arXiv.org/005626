We investigated the relationship between the accretion process and jet properties by ultilizing
the VLBA and mid-infrared (MIR) data for a sample of 45 3CRR radio galaxies selected with a flux density
at 178 MHz $>16.4$ Jy, 5 GHz VLA core flux density $\geq$ 7 mJy, and MIR observations. The pc-scale
radio structure at 5 GHz are presented by using our VLBA observations for 21 sources in February,
2016, the analysis on the archival data for 16 objects, and directly taking the measurements for
8 radio galaxies available in literatures. The accretion mode is constrained from the Eddington
ratio with a dividing value of 0.01, which is estimated from the MIR-based bolometric luminosity
and the black hole masses. While most FRII radio galaxies have higher Eddington ratio than FRIs,
we found that there is indeed no single correspondence between the FR morphology and accretion mode
with eight FRIIs at low accretion and two FRIs at high accretion rate. There is a significant correlation
between the VLBA core luminosity at 5 GHz and the Eddington ratio. Various morphologies are found
in our sample, including core only, single-sided core-jet, and two-sided core-jet structures.
We found that the higher accretion rate may be more likely related with the core-jet structure, thus
more extended jet. These results imply that the higher accretion rates are likely able to produce
more powerful jets. There is a strong correlation between the MIR luminosity at 15 $\mu$m and VLBA
5 GHz core luminosity, in favour of the tight relation between the accretion disk and jets. In our
sample, the core brightness temperature ranges from $10^{9}$ to $10^{13.38}$ K with a median value
of $10^{11.09}$ K indicating that systematically the beaming effect may not be significant....
