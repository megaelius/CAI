Stellar activity is ubiquitously encountered in M dwarfs and often characterised by the H$\alpha$
line. In the most active M dwarfs, H$\alpha$ is found in emission, sometimes with a complex line profile.
Previous studies have reported extended wings and asymmetries in the H$\alpha$ line during flares.
We used a total of 473 high-resolution spectra of 28 active M dwarfs obtained by the CARMENES (Calar
Alto high-Resolution search for M dwarfs with Exo-earths with Near-infrared and optical Echelle
Spectrographs) spectrograph to study the occurrence of broadened and asymmetric H$\alpha$ line
profiles and their association with flares, and examine possible physical explanations. We detected
a total of 41 flares and 67 broad, potentially asymmetric, wings in H$\alpha$. The broadened H$\alpha$
lines display a variety of profiles with symmetric cases and both red and blue asymmetries. Although
some of these line profiles are found during flares, the majority are at least not obviously associated
with flaring. We propose a mechanism similar to coronal rain or chromospheric downward condensations
as a cause for the observed red asymmetries; the symmetric cases may also be caused by Stark broadening.
We suggest that blue asymmetries are associated with rising material, and our results are consistent
with a prevalence of blue asymmetries during the flare onset. Besides the H$\alpha$ asymmetries,
we find some cases of additional line asymmetries in \ion{He}{i} D$_{3}$, \ion{Na}{i}~D lines,
and the \ion{He}{i} line at 10830\,\AA\, taken all simultaneously thanks to the large wavelength
coverage of CARMENES. Our study shows that asymmetric H$\alpha$ lines are a rather common phenomenon
in M~dwarfs and need to be studied in more detail to obtain a better understanding of the atmospheric
dynamics in these objects.
