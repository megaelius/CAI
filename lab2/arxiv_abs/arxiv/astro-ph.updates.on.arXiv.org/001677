For the spectral analysis of high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise spectra of hot stars, state-of-the-art
non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) model-atmospheres are mandatory. These are strongly
dependent on the reliability of the atomic data that is used for their calculation. In a recent analysis
of the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of the DA-type white dwarf G191-B2B, 21 Zn IV lines were newly identified.
Because of the lack of Zn IV data, transition probabilities of the isoelectronic Ge VI were adapted
for a first, coarse determination of the photospheric Zn abundance. We performed new calculations
of Zn IV and Zn V oscillator strengths to consider their radiative and collisional bound-bound transitions
in detail in our NLTE stellar-atmosphere models for the analysis of the Zn IV - V spectrum exhibited
in high-resolution and high-S/N UV observations of G191-B2B and RE0503-289. In the UV spectrum
of G191-B2B, we identify 31 Zn IV and 16 Zn V lines. Most of these are identified for the first time in
any star. We can reproduce well almost all of them at log Zn = -5.52 +/- 0.2 (mass fraction, about 1.7
times solar). In particular, the Zn IV / Zn V ionization equilibrium, which is a very sensitive indicator
for the effective temperature, is well reproduced with the previously determined Teff = 60000 +/-
2000 and log g = 7.60 +/- 0.05. In the spectrum of RE0503-289, we identified 128 Zn V lines for the first
time and determined log Zn = -3.57 +/- 0.2 (155 times solar). Reliable measurements and calculations
of atomic data are a pre-requisite for stellar-atmosphere modeling. Observed Zn IV and Zn V line
profiles in two white dwarf (G191-B2B and RE0503-289) ultraviolet spectra were well reproduced
with our newly calculated oscillator strengths. This allowed us to determine the photospheric
Zn abundance of these two stars precisely.
