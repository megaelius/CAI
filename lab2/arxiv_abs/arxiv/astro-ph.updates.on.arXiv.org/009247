The supernova remnant (SNR) HESS J1731-347 is a young SNR which displays a non-thermal X-ray and
TeV shell structure. A molecular cloud at a distance of 3.2 kpc is spatially coincident with the western
part of the SNR, and it is likely hit by the SNR. The X-ray emission from this part of the shell is much
lower than from the rest of the SNR. Moreover, a compact GeV emission region coincident with the cloud
has been detected with a soft spectrum. These observations seem to imply a shock-cloud collision
scenario at this area, where the stalled shock can no longer accelerate super-TeV electrons or maintain
strong magnetic turbulence downstream, while the GeV cosmic rays (CRs) are released through this
stalled shock. To test this hypothesis, we have performed a detailed Fermi-LAT reanalysis of the
HESS J1731-347 region with over 9 years of data. We find that the compact GeV emission region displays
a spectral power-law index of -2.4, whereas the GeV emission from the rest of the SNR (excluding the
cloud region) has an index of -1.8. A hadronic model involving a shock-cloud collision scenario
is built to explain the -ray emission from this area. It consists of three CR sources: run-away super-TeV
CRs that have escaped from the fast shock, leaked GeV CRs from the stalled shock, and the local CR sea.
The X-ray and -ray emission of the SNR excluding the shock-cloud interaction region is explained
in a one-zone leptonic model. Our shock-cloud collision model explains well the GeV-TeV observations
from both cloud regions around HESS J1731-347, i.e. from the cloud in contact with the SNR and from
the more distant cloud which is coincident with the nearby TeV source HESS J1729-345. We find however
that the leaked GeV CRs from the shock-cloud collision do not necessarily dominate the GeV emission
from the clouds, due to a comparable contribution from the local CR sea.
