For the past 400 years, astronomers have sought to observe and interpret the Universe by building
more powerful telescopes. These incredible instruments extend the capabilities of one of our most
important senses, sight, towards new limits such as increased sensitivity and resolution, new
dimensions such as exploration of wavelengths across the full electromagnetic spectrum, new information
content such as analysis through spectroscopy, and new cadences such as rapid time-series views
of the variable sky. The results from these investments, from small to large telescopes on the ground
and in space, have completely transformed our understanding of the Universe; including the discovery
that Earth is not the center of the Universe, that the Milky Way is one among many galaxies in the Universe,
that relic cosmic background radiation fills all space in the early Universe, that that the expansion
rate of the Universe is accelerating, that exoplanets are common around stars, that gravitational
waves exist, and much more. For modern astronomical research, the next wave of breakthroughs in
fields ranging over planetary, stellar, galactic, and extragalactic science motivate a general-purpose
observatory that is optimized at near- and mid-infrared wavelengths, and that has much greater
sensitivity, resolution, and spectroscopic multiplexing than all previous telescopes. This
scientific vision, from measuring the composition of rocky worlds in the nearby Milky Way galaxy
to finding the first sources of light in the Universe to other topics at the forefront of modern astrophysics,
motivates the state-of-the-art James Webb Space Telescope (Webb). In this review paper, I summarize
the design and technical capabilities of Webb and the scientific opportunities that it enables.
