LB-1 has recently been proposed to be a binary system at 4 kpc consisting of a B star of 8 Msol and a massive
stellar black hole of 70 Msol. This finding challenges our current theories of massive star evolution
and formation of BHs at solar metallicity. Our objective is to derive the effective temperature,
surface gravity and chemical composition of the B-type component in order to determine its nature
and evolutionary status and, indirectly, to constrain the mass of the BH. We use the non-LTE stellar
atmosphere code FASTWIND to analyse new and archival high resolution data. We determine (Teff,
logg) values of (14000$\pm500$ K, 3.50$\pm0.15$ dex) that, combined with the Gaia parallax, implies
a spectroscopic mass, from logg, of $3.2^{+2.1}_{-1.9}$ Msol and an evolutionary mass, assuming
single star evolution, of $5.2^{+0.3}_{-0.6}$ Msol. We determine an upper limit of 8 km/s for the
projected rotational velocity and derive the surface abundances, finding the star to have a silicon
abundance below solar, to be significantly enhanced in nitrogen and iron, and depleted in carbon
and magnesium. Complementary evidence derived from a photometric extinction analysis and Gaia
yields similar results for Teff and logg and a consistent distance around 2~kpc. We propose that
the B star is a slightly evolved main sequence star of 3-5 Msol with surface abundances reminiscent
of diffusion in late B/A chemically peculiar stars with low rotational velocities. There is also
evidence for CN-processed material in its atmosphere. These conclusions rely critically on the
distance inferred from the Gaia parallax. The goodness of fit of the Gaia astrometry also favours
a high-inclination orbit. If the orbit is edge-on and the B star has a mass of 3-5 Msol, the mass of the
dark companion would be 4-5 Msol, which would be easier to explain with our current stellar evolutionary
models.
