One of the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological framework is the hierarchical formation
of structure, giving rise to dark matter (DM) halos and subhalos. When the latter are massive enough
they retain gas (i.e., baryons) and become visible. This is the case of the dwarf satellite galaxies
in the Milky Way (MW). Below a certain mass, halos may not accumulate significant amounts of baryons
and remain completely dark. However, if DM particles are Weakly Interacting Massive Particles
(WIMPs), we expect them to annihilate in subhalos, producing gamma rays which can be detected with
the Fermi satellite. Using the three most recent point-source Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT)
catalogs (3FGL, 2FHL and 3FHL), we search for DM subhalo candidates among the unidentified sources,
i.e., sources with no firm association to a known astrophysical object. We apply several selection
criteria based on the expected properties of the DM-induced emission from subhalos, which allow
us to significantly reduce the list of potential candidates. Then, by characterizing the minimum
detection flux of the instrument and comparing our sample to predictions from the Via Lactea II (VL-II)
N-body cosmological simulation, we place conservative and robust constraints on the $\langle\sigma
v\rangle-m_{DM}$ parameter space. For annihilation via the $\tau^+\tau^-$ channel, we put an
upper limit of $4\times 10^{-26}~(5\times 10^{-25})~cm^3~s^{-1}$ for a mass of 10 (100) GeV. A
critical improvement over previous treatments is the repopulation we made to include low-mass
subhalos below the VL-II mass resolution. With more advanced subhalo candidate filtering the sensitivity
reach of our method can potentially improve these constraints by a factor 3 (2) for $\tau^+\tau^-$
($b \bar{b}$) channel.
