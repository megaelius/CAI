An introduction is given to a meeting on the role of massive and stellar black holes in powering non-thermal
activity in a rich variety of cosmic sources. Relevant properties of magnetized, spinning black
holes are summarized and their observational expression, within galactic nuclei, in terms of radio
loudness and Fanaroff-Riley class, is briefly described. The dependence of the accretion mode
on the rate and manner of the mass supply beyond the black hole sphere of influence is also discussed.
It is argued that hydromagnetic outflows from accretion disks are generally expected over as many
as six decades of radius and that they may be the source of emission line gas. These outflows collimate
the relativistic jets which are probably generated in an electromagnetic form but become hydromagnetic
as they entrain gas through boundary layers where most of the initial nonthermal emission occurs.
It is proposed that the particle acceleration close to the hole emphasizes the proton channel which
allows secondary pairs to be created at far higher energies than is possible from direct acceleration.
These pairs radiate synchrotron gamma-rays which can escape along the jet because the outflow effectively
shields them from pair-producing, soft photons. Jets are subject to helical instabilities which
can tangle their magnetic field and may destroy them. The jet should become plasma-dominated through
intermittent, "magnetoluminescent" untangling of the field which causes nonthermal emission
all along its length. Powerful jets remain supersonic out to the "hot spots" at the extremities of
the source; weaker jets become subsonic plumes or bubbles. The prospects for learning much more
about the nature and operation of jets over the next decade are excellent.
