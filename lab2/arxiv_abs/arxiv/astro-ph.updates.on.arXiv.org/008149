We aim at detecting and characterizing the main-sequence companions of a sample of known and suspected
Galactic binary Cepheids. We used the multi-telescope interferometric combiners MIRC and PIONIER
to detect and measure the astrometric positions of the high-contrast companions orbiting 16 bright
Galactic Cepheids. We made use of the CANDID algorithm to search for the companions and set detection
limits. We also present new high-precision RVs which were used to fit radial pulsation and orbital
velocities. We report the detection of the companions orbiting the Cepheids U Aql, BP Cir, and S Mus,
possible detections for FF Aql, Y Car, BG Cru, X Sgr, V350 Sgr, and V636 Sco, while no component is detected
around U Car, YZ Car, T Mon, R Mus, S Nor, W Sgr and AH Vel. For U Aql and S Mus, we performed a preliminary
orbital fit combining astrometry with new high-precision RVs, providing the full set of orbital
and pulsation parameters. Assuming the distance, we estimated preliminary masses of M(U Aql) =
4.97+/-0.62Msun and M(S Mus) = 4.63+/-0.99Msun. For YZ Car, W Sgr, V350 Sgr, and V636 Sco, we revised
the spectroscopic orbits using new high-precision RVs, while we updated the pulsation parameters
for BP Cir, BG Cru, S Nor and AH Vel. Our interferometric observations also provide measurements
of the angular diameters, that can be used in a Baade-Wesselink type analysis. We have now several
astrometric detections of Cepheid companions. When RVs of the companions will be available, such
systems will provide accurate and independent masses and distances. Orbital parallaxes with an
accuracy <5% will be particularly useful for a better calibration of the P-L relation. The final
Gaia parallaxes will be also particularly helpful for single-line spectroscopic systems, where
mass and distance are degenerate. Mass measurements are necessary for a better understanding of
the age and evolution of Cepheids
