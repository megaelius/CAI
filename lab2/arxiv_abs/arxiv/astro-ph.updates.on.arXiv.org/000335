We explore the structure of nuclei and topological defects in the first-order phase transition
between the nematic (N) and isotropic (I) phases in lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (LCLCs).
The LCLCs are formed by self-assembled molecular aggregates of various lengths and show a broad
biphasic region. The defects emerge as a result of two mechanisms. 1) Surface anisotropy mechanism
that endows each N nucleus (tactoid) with topological defects thanks to preferential (tangential)
orientation of the director at the closed I-N interface, and 2) Kibble mechanism with defects forming
when differently oriented N tactoids merge with each other. Different scenarios of phase transition
involve positive (N-in-I) and negative (I-in-N) tactoids with non-trivial topology of the director
field and also multiply connected tactoids-in-tactoids configurations. The closed I-N interface
limiting a tactoid shows a certain number of cusps; the lips of the interface on the opposite sides
of the cusp make an angle different from pi. The N side of each cusp contains a point defect-boojum.
The number of cusps shows how many times the director becomes perpendicular to the I-N interface
when one circumnavigates the closed boundary of the tactoid. We derive conservation laws that connect
the number of cusps c to the topological strength m of defects in the N part of the simply-connected
and multiply-connected tactoids. We demonstrate how the elastic anisotropy of the N phase results
in non-circular shape of the disclination cores. A generalized Wulff construction is used to derive
the shape of I and N tactoids as the function of I-N interfacial tension anisotropy in the frozen director
field of various topological charges m. The complex shapes and structures of tactoids and topological
defects demonstrate an important role of surface anisotropy in morphogenesis of phase transitions
in liquid crystals.
