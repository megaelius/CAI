(abridged) We correlated near-infrared stellar H-Ks colour excesses of background stars from
NTT/SOFI with the far-IR optical depth map, tauFIR, derived from Herschel 160, 250, 350, and 500
um data. The Herschel maps were also used to construct a model for the cloud to examine the effect of
temperature gradients on the estimated optical depths and dust absorption cross-sections. A linear
correlation is seen between the colour H-Ks and tauFIR up to high extinctions (AV ~ 25). The correlation
translates to the average extinction ratio A250um/AJ = 0.0014 +/- 0.0002, assuming a standard near-infrared
extinction law and a dust emissivity index beta=2. Using an empirical NH/AJ ratio we obtain an average
absorption cross-section per H nucleus of sigmaH(250um) = (1.8 +/- 0.3) * 10^(-25) cm^2 / H-atom,
corresponding to a cross-section per unit mass of gas kappaG(250 um) = 0.08 +/- 0.01 cm^2 / g. The cloud
model however suggests that owing to the bias caused by temperature changes along the line-of-sight
these values underestimate the true cross-sections by up to 40% near the centre of the core. Assuming
that the model describes the effect of the temperature variation on tauFIR correctly, we find that
the relationship between H-Ks and tauFIR agrees with the recently determined relationship between
sigmaH and NH in Orion A. The derived far-IR cross-section agrees with previous determinations
in molecular clouds with moderate column densities, and is not particularly large compared with
some other cold cores. We suggest that this is connected to the core not beng very dense (the central
density is likely to be ~10^5 cm^-3) and judging from previous molecular line data, it appears to
be at an early stage of chemical evolution.
