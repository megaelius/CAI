Dark matter halo clustering depends not only on halo mass, but also on other properties such as concentration
and shape. This phenomenon is known broadly as assembly bias. We explore the dependence of assembly
bias on halo definition, parametrized by spherical overdensity parameter, $\Delta$. We summarize
the strength of concentration-, shape-, and spin-dependent halo clustering as a function of halo
mass and halo definition. Concentration-dependent clustering depends strongly on mass at all
$\Delta$. For conventional halo definitions ($\Delta \sim 200\mathrm{m}-600\mathrm{m}$),
concentration-dependent clustering at low mass is driven by a population of haloes that is altered
through interactions with neighbouring haloes. Concentration-dependent clustering can be greatly
reduced through a mass-dependent halo definition with $\Delta \sim 20\mathrm{m}-40\mathrm{m}$
for haloes with $M_{200\mathrm{m}} \lesssim 10^{12}\, h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Smaller
$\Delta$ implies larger radii and mitigates assembly bias at low mass by subsuming altered, so-called
backsplash haloes into now larger host haloes. At higher masses ($M_{200\mathrm{m}} \gtrsim 10^{13}\,
h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) larger overdensities, $\Delta \gtrsim 600\mathrm{m}$, are necessary.
Shape- and spin-dependent clustering are significant for all halo definitions that we explore
and exhibit a relatively weaker mass dependence. Generally, both the strength and the sense of assembly
bias depend on halo definition, varying significantly even among common definitions. We identify
no halo definition that mitigates all manifestations of assembly bias. A halo definition that mitigates
assembly bias based on one halo property (e.g., concentration) must be mass dependent. The halo
definitions that best mitigate concentration-dependent halo clustering do not coincide with
the expected average splashback radii at fixed halo mass.
