We study tidal dissipation in stars with masses in the range $0.1-1.6 M_\odot$ throughout their
evolution, including turbulent effective viscosity acting on equilibrium tides and inertial
waves in convection zones, and internal gravity waves in radiation zones. We consider a range of
stellar evolutionary models and incorporate the frequency-dependent effective viscosity acting
on equilibrium tides based on the latest simulations. We compare the tidal flow and dissipation
obtained with the conventional equilibrium tide, which is strictly invalid in convection zones,
finding that the latter typically over-predicts the dissipation by a factor of 2-3. Dissipation
of inertial waves is computed using a frequency-averaged formalism accounting for realistic stellar
structure for the first time, and is the dominant mechanism for binary circularization and synchronization
on the main sequence. Dissipation of gravity waves in the radiation zone assumes these waves to be
fully damped (e.g.~by wave breaking), and is the dominant mechanism for planetary orbital decay.
We calculate the critical planetary mass required for wave breaking as a function of stellar mass
and age, and show that this mechanism predicts destruction of many hot Jupiters but probably not
Earth-mass planets on the main sequence. We apply our results to compute tidal quality factors following
stellar evolution, and tidal evolutionary timescales, for the orbital decay of hot Jupiters, and
the spin synchronization and circularization of binary stars. We also provide predictions for
shifts in transit arrival times due to tidally-driven orbital decay of hot Jupiters that may be detected
with NGTS, TESS or PLATO.
