We conduct a deep narrow-band imaging survey of 13 Ly$\alpha$ blobs (LABs) located in the SSA22 proto-cluster
at z~3.1 in the CIV and HeII emission lines in an effort to constrain the physical process powering
the Ly$\alpha$ emission in LABs. Our observations probe down to unprecedented surface brightness
limits of 2.1 $-$ 3.4 $\times$ 10$^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ per 1 arcsec$^2$
aperture (5$\sigma$) for the HeII$\lambda$1640 and CIV$\lambda$1549 lines, respectively. We
do not detect extended HeII and CIV emission in any of the LABs, placing strong upper limits on the
HeII/Ly$\alpha$ and CIV/Ly$\alpha$ line ratios, of 0.11 and 0.16, for the brightest two LABs in
the field. We conduct detailed photoionization modeling of the expected line ratios and find that,
although our data constitute the deepest ever observations of these lines, they are still not deep
enough to rule out a scenario where the Ly$\alpha$ emission is powered by the ionizing luminosity
of an obscured AGN. Our models can accommodate HeII/Ly$\alpha$ and CIV/Ly$\alpha$ ratios as low
as $\simeq$0.05 and $\simeq$0.07 respectively, implying that one needs to reach surface brightness
as low as 1 $-$ 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ (at 5$\sigma$) in order
to rule out a photoionization scenario. These depths will be achievable with the new generation
of image-slicing integral field units such as VLT/MUSE or Keck/KCWI. We also model the expected
HeII/Ly$\alpha$ and CIV/Ly$\alpha$ in a different scenario, where Ly$\alpha$ emission is powered
by shocks generated in a large-scale superwind, but find that our observational constraints can
only be met for shock velocities $v_{\rm s} \gtrsim$ 250 km s$^{-1}$, which appear to be in conflict
with recent observations of quiescent kinematics in LABs.
