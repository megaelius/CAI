Diagnosing the physical and chemical conditions within star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is of paramount
importance to understanding key components of galaxy formation and evolution: star-formation,
gas enrichment, outflows, and accretion. Well established optical emission-line diagnostics
used to discern such properties (i.e., metal content, density, strength/shape of ionizing radiation)
will be observationally inaccessible for the earliest galaxies, emphasizing the need for robust,
reliable interstellar medium (ISM) diagnostics at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. Calibrating
these UV diagnostics requires a comprehensive comparison of the UV and optical emission lines in
nearby SFGs. Optical integral field unit (IFU) surveys have revealed the inhomogeneous nature
of the ISM in SFGs, which leads to non-systematic biases in the interpretation of unresolved sources.
Spatial variations are especially important to consider at UV wavelengths, where the strongest
emission features originate from only the highest excitation regions of the nebula and are challenging
to distinguish from competing high-ionization sources (e.g., shocks, AGN, etc.). Since surveys
collecting large-scale optical integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy are already underway,
this white paper calls for an IFU or multi-object far-UV (FUV) spectroscopic instrument with high
sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and large field of view (FoV). Given the impact of large-scale
optical IFU surveys over the past decade, this white paper emphasizes the scientific need for a comparable
foundation of spatially-resolved far-UV spectroscopy survey of nearby galaxies that will lay
the foundation of diagnostics critical to the interpretation of the distant universe.
