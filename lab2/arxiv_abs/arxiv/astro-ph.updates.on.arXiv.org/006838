The ionization mechanism of the low-ionization gas in quiescent red sequence galaxies has been
a long-standing puzzle. Direct temperature measurements would put strong constraints on this
issue. We carefully selected a sample of quiescent red sequence galaxies from SDSS. We bin them into
three bins with different [N II]/H{\alpha} and [N II]/[O II] ratios, and we measure the temperature-sensitive
[O III] {\lambda}4363, [N II] {\lambda}5755, [S II] {\lambda}{\lambda}4068,4076, and [O II] {\lambda}{\lambda}7320,7330
lines in the stacked spectra. The [S II] doublet ratios indicate the line-emitting gas is in the low
density regime (~10-100 cm$^{-3}$).We found the temperatures in the S+ zones to be around 8000K,
the temperatures in the O+ zones to be around $1.1-1.5\times10^4$K, and the temperatures in the
N+ zones to be around $1-1.4\times10^4$K. The [O III] {\lambda}4363 line is not robustly detected.
We found that the extinction corrections derived from Balmer decrements would yield unphysical
relationships between the temperatures of the S+ zones and O+ zones, indicating that the extinction
is significantly overestimated by the measured Balmer decrements. We compared these line ratios
with model predictions for three ionization mechanisms: photoionization by hot evolved stars,
shocks, and turbulent mixing layers. For both the photoionization and shock models, the hot temperatures
inferred from [S II] and [N II] coronal-to-strong line ratios require metallicities to be significantly
subsolar. However, the [N II]/[O II] line ratios require them to be supersolar. None of the models
could simultaneously explain all of the observed line ratios, neither could their combinations
do.
