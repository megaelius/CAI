We present a new methodology for the estimation of stellar atmospheric parameters from narrow-
and intermediate-band photometry of the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS),
and propose a method for target pre-selection of low-metallicity stars for follow-up spectroscopic
studies. Photometric metallicity estimates for stars in the globular cluster M15 are determined
using this method. By development of a neural-network-based photometry pipeline, we aim to produce
estimates of effective temperature, $T_{\rm eff}$, and metallicity, [Fe/H], for a large subset
of stars in the J-PLUS footprint. The Stellar Photometric Index Network Explorer, SPHINX, is developed
to produce estimates of $T_{\rm eff}$ and [Fe/H], after training on a combination of J-PLUS photometric
inputs and synthetic magnitudes computed for medium-resolution (R ~ 2000) spectra of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. This methodology is applied to J-PLUS photometry of the globular cluster M15.
Effective temperature estimates made with J-PLUS Early Data Release photometry exhibit low scatter,
\sigma($T_{\rm eff}$) = 91 K, over the temperature range 4500 < $T_{\rm eff}$ (K) < 8500. For stars
from the J-PLUS First Data Release with 4500 < $T_{\rm eff}$ (K) < 6200, 85 $\pm$ 3% of stars known to
have [Fe/H] <-2.0 are recovered by SPHINX. A mean metallicity of [Fe/H]=-2.32 $\pm$ 0.01, with a
residual spread of 0.3 dex, is determined for M15 using J-PLUS photometry of 664 likely cluster members.
We confirm the performance of SPHINX within the ranges specified, and verify its utility as a stand-alone
tool for photometric estimation of effective temperature and metallicity, and for pre-selection
of metal-poor spectroscopic targets.
