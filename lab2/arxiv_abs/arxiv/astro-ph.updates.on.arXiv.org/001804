Clusters of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been proposed as candidates for evaporating
very small grains, which are thought to be precursors of free-flying PAHs. Evaporation rates have
been calculated so far only for species containing up to a few 100 C atoms, whereas interstellar PAH
clusters could contain up to ~1000 C atoms. We present a method that generalises the calculation
of the statistical evaporation rate of large PAH clusters and provides rates for species containing
up to ~1000 C-atoms. The evaporation of non-rotating neutral homo-molecular PAH clusters containing
up to 12 molecules from a family of highly symmetric compact PAHs is studied. Statistical calculations
were performed and completed with molecular dynamics simulations at high internal energies to
provide absolute values for the evaporation rate and distributions of kinetic energy released.
The calculations used explicit atom-atom Lennard-Jones potentials in the rigid molecule approximation.
A new method is proposed to take both inter- and intra-molecular vibrations into account. Without
any parameter adjustment, the calculated evaporation rates agree well with available experimental
data. We find that the non-rotation assumption has a limited impact on the evaporation rates. The
photostability of PAH clusters increases dramatically with the size of molecules in the clusters,
and to a lesser extent with the number of molecules in the clusters. For values of the UV radiation
field that are typical of the regions where evaporating very small grains are observed, the smallest
clusters in this study (~50 C-atoms) are found to be quickly photo-evaporated, whereas the largest
clusters (~1000 C-atoms) are photostable. Our results support the idea that large PAH clusters
are good candidates for evaporating very small grains.
