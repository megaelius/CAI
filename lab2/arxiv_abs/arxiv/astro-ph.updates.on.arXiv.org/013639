We fit the ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray (UHECR, $E\gtrsim0.1$ EeV) spectrum and composition data
from the Pierre Auger Observatory at energies $E\gtrsim5\cdot10^{18}$ eV, i.e., beyond the ankle
using two populations of astrophysical sources. One population, accelerating dominantly protons
($^1$H), extends up to the highest observed energies with maximum energy close to the GZK cutoff
and injection spectral index near the Fermi acceleration model; while another population accelerates
light-to-heavy nuclei ($^4$He, $^{14}$N, $^{28}$Si, $^{56}$Fe) with a relatively low rigidity
cutoff and hard injection spectrum. A single extragalactic homogeneous source population with
a mixed composition ($^1$H, $^4$He, $^{14}$N, $^{28}$Si, $^{56}$Fe) at injection leads to zero
$^1$H abundance fraction, while fitting the spectrum at energies $\gtrsim 5\cdot10^{18}$ eV.
With our choice of exponential cutoff power-law injection spectrum and \textsc{sybill2.3c} hadronic
interaction model, we investigate the effects on composition predictions and other UHECR source
parameters, as we go from a single-population to two-population model. For the latter, a non-zero
$^1$H abundance is found to be inevitable at the highest energies, and a significant improvement
in the combined fit is noted on addition of a pure-proton spectrum. We vary the proton injection index
to find the best-fit parameter values of the two-population model, and constrain the maximum allowed
proton fraction at the highest-energy bin within 3.5$\sigma$ statistical significance. We compute
expected cosmogenic neutrino flux in such a hybrid source population scenario and discuss possibilities
to detect these neutrinos by upcoming detectors to shed light on the sources of UHECRs.
