The coded-mask spectrometer-telescope SPI on board the INTEGRAL observatory records photons
in the energy range between 20 and 8000 keV. A robust and versatile method to model the dominating
instrumental background (BG) radiation is difficult to establish for such a telescope in the rapidly
changing space environment. From long-term monitoring of SPI's Germanium detectors, we built
up a spectral parameter data base, which characterises the instrument response as well as the BG
behaviour. We aim to build a self-consistent and broadly applicable BG model for typical science
cases of INTEGRAL/SPI, based on this data base. The general analysis method for SPI relies on distinguishing
between illumination patterns on the 19-element Germanium detector array from BG and sky in a maximum
likelihood framework. We illustrate how the complete set of measurements, even including the exposures
of the sources of interest, can be used to define a BG model. We apply our method to different science
cases, including point-like, diffuse, continuum, and line emission, and evaluate the adequacy
in each case. From likelihood values and the number of fitted parameters, we determine how strong
the impact of the unknown BG variability is. We find that the number of fitted parameters, i.e. how
often the BG has to be re-normalised, depends on the emission type (diffuse with many observations
over a large sky region, or point-like with concentrated exposure around one source), and the spectral
energy range and bandwidth. A unique time scale, valid for all analysis issues, is not applicable
for INTEGRAL/SPI, but must and can be inferred from the chosen data set. We conclude that our BG modelling
method is usable in a large variety of INTEGRAL/SPI science cases, and provides nearly systematics-free
and robust results.
