Classical novae are the results of surface thermonuclear explosions of hydrogen accreted by white
dwarfs (WDs) from their low-mass main-sequence or red-giant binary companions. Chemical composition
analysis of their ejecta shows that nova outbursts occur on both carbon-oxygen (CO) and more massive
oxygen-neon (ONe) WDs, and that there is cross-boundary mixing between the accreted envelope and
underlying WD. We demonstrate that the state-of-the-art stellar evolution code MESA and post-processing
nucleosynthesis tools of NuGrid can successfully be used for modeling of CO and ONe nova outbursts
and nucleosynthesis. The convective boundary mixing (CBM) in our 1D numerical simulations is implemented
using a diffusion coefficient that is exponentially decreasing with a distance below the bottom
of the convective envelope. We show that this prescription produces maximum temperature evolution
profiles and nucleosynthesis yields in good agreement with those obtained using the commonly adopted
1D nova model in which the CBM is mimicked by assuming that the accreted envelope has been pre-mixed
with WD's material. In a previous paper, we have found that 3He can be produced in situ in solar-composition
envelopes accreted with slow rates (dM/dt < 1e-10 M_sun/yr) by cold (T_WD < 1d7 K) CO WDs, and
that convection is triggered by 3He burning before the nova outburst in this case. Here, we confirm
this result for ONe novae. Additionally, we find that the interplay between the 3He production and
destruction in the solar-composition envelope accreted with an intermediate rate, e.g. dM/dt
= 1e-10 M_sun/yr, by the 1.15 M_sun ONe WD with a relatively high initial central temperature, e.g.
T_WD = 15e6 K, leads to the formation of a thick radiative buffer zone that separates the bottom of
the convective envelope from the WD surface.
