The (black hole mass, $M_\text{BH}$)-(bulge stellar mass, $M_{\rm*,sph}$) relation is, obviously,
derived using two quantities. We endeavor to provide accurate values for the latter by generating
detailed multi-component galaxy decompositions for the current full sample of 43 spiral galaxies
having directly measured supermassive black hole masses - 35 of these galaxies have been alleged
to contain pseudobulges, and another three appear bulgeless. This more than doubles the previous
sample size of spiral galaxies with a finessed image analysis. We have analyzed their near-infrared
images with meticulous care, accounting for not only the bulge, disk (exponential, truncated,
or inclined), and bar, but also for spiral arms and rings, and additional central components (active
galactic nuclei, etc.), all of which can bias the bulge parameters if they are not included. A symmetric
Bayesian analysis finds $M_{\rm BH}\propto M_{\rm *,sph}^{2.44\pm0.31}$. This result corroborates
previous observational studies, and simulations, which have reported a near-quadratic slope
at the low-mass end of the $M_\text{BH}$-$M_{\rm*,sph}$ diagram. The non-linear slope additionally
rules out the idea that many mergers, coupled with the central limit theorem, independently produced
this scaling relation, and it has important implications for the formation pathway of supermassive
black holes. Models that have invoked active galactic nuclei feedback to establish a linear $M_{\rm
BH}$-$M_{\rm*,sph}$ relation need revisiting. We additionally present an updated $M_\text{BH}$-(S\'ersic
index, $n_\text{sph}$) relation for spiral galaxy bulges, with a comparable level of scatter,
and a new $M_{\rm*,sph}$-(spiral arm pitch angle, $\phi$) relation.
