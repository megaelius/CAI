The crystalline color superconducting phase is believed to be the ground state of deconfined quark
matter for sufficiently large values of the strange quark mass. This phase has the remarkable property
of being more rigid than any known material. It can therefore sustain large shear stresses, supporting
torsional oscillations of large amplitude. The torsional oscillations could lead to observable
electromagnetic signals if strange stars have a crystalline color superconducting crust. Indeed,
considering a simple model of strange star with a bare quark matter surface, it turns out that a positive
charge is localized in a narrow shell about ten Fermi thick beneath the star surface. The electrons
needed to neutralize the positive charge of quarks spill in the star exterior forming an electromagnetically
bounded atmosphere hundreds of Fermi thick. When a torsional oscillation is excited, for example
by a stellar glitch, the positive charge oscillates with typical kHz frequencies, for a $1$ km thick
crust, to hundreds of Hz, for a $9$ km thick crust. Higher frequencies, of the order of few GHz, can
be reached if the star crust is of the order of few centimeters thick. We estimate the emitted power
considering emission by an oscillating magnetic dipole, finding that it can be quite large, of the
order of $10^{51}$ erg/s. The associated relaxation times are very uncertain, with values ranging
between milliseconds, for a $1$ km thick crust, to minutes, for a $9$ km crust. The radiated photons
will be in part absorbed by the electronic atmosphere, but a sizable fraction of them should be emitted
by the star.
