The level of spatial complexity associated with a given vector field on an arbitrary range of scales
\iffalse ${\bf F(x}, t)$ can be quantified by a simple, time-dependent function $S(t)={1\over
2}(1-\hat{\bf F}_l.\hat{\bf F}_L)_{rms}$ with ${\bf F}_l$ (${\bf F}_L$) being the average field
in a volume of scale $l$ ($L>l$) and the unit vector defined as $\hat{\bf F}={\bf F}/|{\bf F}|$. Thus,\fi
can be quantified by a simple, scale-dependent function of time; $0\leq S(t)\leq 1$. Previous work
has invoked kinetic and magnetic complexities, associated with velocity and magnetic fields ${\bf
u(x}, t)$ and ${\bf B(x}, t)$, to study magnetic reconnection and diffusion in turbulent and magnetized
fluids. In this paper, using the coarse-grained momentum equation, we argue that the fluid jets
associated with magnetic reconnection events at an arbitrary scale $l$ in the turbulence inertial
range are predominantly driven by the Lorentz force ${\bf{N}}_l=({\bf j\times B})_l-{\bf j}_l\times
{\bf B}_l$. This force, is induced by the subscale currents and is analogous to the turbulent electromotive
force ${\cal E}_l=({\bf u\times B})_l-{\bf u}_l\times {\bf B}_l$ in dynamo theories. Typically,
high (low) magnetic complexities during reconnection imply large (small) spatial gradients for
the magnetic field, i.e., strong (weak) Lorentz forces ${\bf N}_l$. Reconnection launches jets
of fluid, hence the rate of change of kinetic complexity is expected to strongly correlate with the
power injected by the Lorentz force ${\bf N}_l$. We test this prediction using an incompressible,
homogeneous magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation and associate it with previous results. It
follows that the stronger (weaker) the turbulence, the more (less) complex the magnetic field and
the stronger (weaker) the reconnection field and thus the ensuing reconnection.
