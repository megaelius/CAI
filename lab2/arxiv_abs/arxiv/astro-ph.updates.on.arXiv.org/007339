We present an analytic, parametric model to describe the supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB)
merger rate in the Universe in terms of astrophysical observables: galaxy stellar mass function,
pair fraction, merger timescale and black hole - host galaxy relations. We construct observational
priors for each observable and compute the allowed range of the characteristic spectrum $h_c$ of
the gravitational wave background (GWB) emitted to be $10^{-16}<h_c<10^{-15}$ at a frequency
of 1/1yr. We then exploit our novel parametrization to tackle the problem of astrophysical inference
from Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations. We simulate a series of progressively more stringent
PTA upper limits, as well as detections and use a nested sampling algorithm to explore the parameter
space of the underlying model. Corroborating previous results, we find that the current PTA non-detection
does not place significant constraints on any observables; however, either more stringent future
upper limits or detections will significantly enhance our knowledge of the SMBHB population and
the physics of galaxy mergers. If a GWB is not detected at a nominal level of $h_c(f=1{\rm yr}^{-1})=10^{-17}$,
our current understanding of the physics driving galaxy and SMBHB mergers is disfavoured at a $5\sigma$
level, indicating a combination of severe binary stalling, over-estimating of the SMBH -- host
galaxy relations, and extreme dynamical properties of merging SMBHBs. Conversely, future detections
will allow to constrain some physical key parameters. An SKA-type array will be able to constrain
the normalization of the SMBHB merger rate in the universe, the typical time elapsed between galaxy
pairing and SMBHB mergers, the intrinsic normalization of the SMBH -- host galaxy relations and
the dynamical properties of the merging SMBHBs, including their typical eccentricity and the density
of their stellar environment.
