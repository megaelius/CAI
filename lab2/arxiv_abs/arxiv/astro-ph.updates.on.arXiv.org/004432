Ultralight bosons and axion-like particles appear naturally in different scenarios and could
solve some long-standing puzzles. Their detection is challenging, and all direct methods hinge
on unknown couplings to the Standard Model of particle physics. However, the universal coupling
to gravity provides model-independent signatures for these fields. We explore here the superradiant
instability of spinning black holes triggered in the presence of such fields. The instability taps
angular momentum from and limits the maximum spin of astrophysical black holes. We compute, for
the first time, the spectrum of the most unstable modes of a massive vector (Proca) field for generic
black-hole spin and Proca mass. The observed stability of the inner disk of stellar-mass black holes
can be used to derive \emph{direct} constraints on the mass of dark photons in the mass range $ 10^{-13}\,{\rm
eV}\lesssim m_V \lesssim 3\times 10^{-12}\,{\rm eV}$. By including also higher azimuthal modes,
similar constraints apply to axion-like particles in the mass range $6\times10^{-13}\,{\rm eV}\lesssim
m_{\rm ALP} \lesssim 10^{-11}\, {\rm eV}$. Likewise, mass and spin distributions of supermassive
BHs --~as measured through continuum fitting, K$\alpha$ iron line, or with the future space-based
gravitational-wave detector LISA~-- imply indirect bounds in the mass range approximately $10^{-19}\,{\rm
eV}\lesssim m_V, m_{\rm ALP} \lesssim 10^{-13}\, {\rm eV}$, for both axion-like particles and
dark photons. Overall, superradiance allows to explore a region of approximately $8$ orders of
magnitude in the mass of ultralight bosons.
