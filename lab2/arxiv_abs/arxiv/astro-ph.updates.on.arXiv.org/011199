The Upper-Scorpius association (5-11 Myr) contains a unique population of low-mass (M<30 MJup)
brown-dwarfs. The detailed relative characterization of their physical properties (mass, radius,
temperature, composition, ongoing accretion) offers the opportunity to potentially explore
their origin and their mechanisms of formation. We aim at characterizing the chemical and physical
properties of three young, late-M brown-dwarfs claimed to be companions of the Upper-Scorpius
stars USco161031.9-16191305, HIP77900, and HIP78530 using medium resolution spectroscopy at
UV (R~3300), optical (R~5400), and near-infrared (R~4300) wavelengths. The spectra of six free-floating
analogues from the same association are analyzed for comparison and to explore the potential physical
differences between these substellar objects. We also aim at analyzing emission lines at UV and
optical wavelengths to investigate the presence of ongoing accretion processes. The X-Shooter
spectrograph at VLT was used to obtain the spectra of our targets over the 0.3-2.5 $\mu$m range simultaneously.
Performing a forward modelling of the observed spectra with the ForMoSA code (Nested Sampling Bayesian
inference method in using BT-SETTL15 models), we infer the Teff, log(g), and radius of our objects.
Our results are compatible with physical parameters found for free floating analogues of the association
and with evolutionary-model predictions. However the final accuracy on the Teff estimates is strongly
limited by non-reproducibilities of the BT-SETTL15 models for late-M brown-dwarfs. We identified
emission lines in the spectrum of several objects attributed to chromospheric activity except
for USco1608-2315 for which they are indicative of active accretion. We confirm the x4 over-luminosity
of USco161031.9-16191305B. It could be explained by the object activity and if the companion is
an unresolved multiple system.
