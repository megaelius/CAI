The XMM-Newton Survey Science Centre Consortium (SSC) develops software in close collaboration
with the Science Operations Centre to perform a pipeline analysis of all XMM-Newton observations.
In celebration of the 20th launch anniversary, the SSC has compiled the 4th generation of serendipitous
source catalogues, 4XMM. The catalogue described here, 4XMM-DR9s, explores sky areas that were
observed more than once by XMM-Newton. It was constructed from simultaneous source detection on
the overlapping observations, which were bundled in groups ("stacks"). Stacking leads to a higher
sensitivity, resulting in newly discovered sources and better constrained source parameters,
and unveils long-term brightness variations. As a novel feature, positional rectification was
applied beforehand. Observations with all filters and suitable camera settings were included.
Exposures with a high background were discarded, which was determined through a statistical analysis
of all exposures in each instrument configuration. The X-ray background maps used in source detection
were modelled via adaptive smoothing with newly determined parameters. Source fluxes were derived
for all contributing observations, irrespective of whether the source would be detectable in an
individual observation. From 1,329 stacks with 6,604 contributing observations over repeatedly
covered 300 square degrees in the sky, 4XMM-DR9s lists 288,191 sources. 218,283 of them were observed
several times. Most stacks are composed of two observations, the largest one comprises 352. The
number of observations of a source ranges from 1 to 40. Auxiliary products like X-ray images, long-term
light curves, and optical finding charts are published as well. 4XMM-DR9s is considered a prime
resource to explore long-term variability of X-ray sources discovered by XMM-Newton. Regular
incremental releases including new public observations are planned.
