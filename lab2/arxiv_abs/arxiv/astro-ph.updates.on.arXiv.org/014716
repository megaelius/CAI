Apparent deviations between properties of dwarf galaxies from observations and simulations are
known to exist, such as the "Missing Dwarfs" problem, the too-big-to-fail problem, and the cusp-core
problem, to name a few. Recent studies have shown that these issues can at least be partially resolved
by taking into account the systematic differences between simulations and observations. This
work aims to investigate and address any systematic differences affecting the comparison of simulations
with observations. To this aim, we analyzed a set of 24 realistically simulated MoRIA (Models of
Realistic dwarfs In Action) dwarf galaxies in an observationally motivated way. We first constructed
"observed" color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of the simulated dwarf galaxies in the typically used
V- and I-bands. Then we used the CMD-fitting method to recover their star-formation histories (SFHs)
from their observed CMDs. These solved SFHs were then directly compared to the true SFHs from the
simulation star-particle data, mainly in terms of the star-formation rate(SFR) and the age-metallicity
relation (AMR). We applied a dust extinction prescription to the simulation data to produce observed
CMDs affected by dust in star-formation regions. Since future facilities, such as the JWST and E-ELT
will focus on the near IR rather than the optical, we also constructed and analyzed CMDs using the
I- and H-bands. We find a very good agreement between the recovered and the true SFHs of all the simulated
dwarf galaxies in our sample, from the synthetic CMD analysis of their V-I versus I as well as the I-H
versus H CMDs. Dust leads to an underestimation of the SFR during the last few hundred million years.
Overall, our analysis indicates that quantities like SFR and AMR derived from the photometric observations
of galaxies are directly comparable to their simulated counterparts.
