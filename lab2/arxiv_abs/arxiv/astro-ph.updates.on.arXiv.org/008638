Estimating the sky background is critical for ground-based astronomical research. In the optical,
scattered moonlight dominates the sky background, when the moon is above the horizon. The most uncertain
component of a scattered moonlight model is the aerosol scattering. The current sky background
model for Cerro Paranal uses an extrapolated aerosol extinction curve. With a set of X-Shooter sky
observations, we have tested the current model as well as determined the aerosol extinction from
the ultra-violet to near-infrared. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a scattered moonlight
model has been used for this purpose. These observations were taken of blank sky, during three different
lunar phases, and at six different angular distances from the moon for each night/lunar phase. Overall,
the current model does reproduce the observations for average conditions decently well. Using
a set of sky background models with varying aerosol distributions to compare with the observations,
we found the most likely aerosol extinction curves, phase functions, and volume densities for the
three nights of observations and compare them with the current model. While there were some degeneracies
in the aerosol scattering properties, the extinction curves tend to flatten towards redder wavelengths
and are overall less steep compared to the extrapolated curve used in the current model. Also, the
current model had significantly less coarse particles compared to the favored volume densities
from the X-Shooter data. For the three nights of sky observations, the aerosol size distributions
differed, most likely reflecting the changes in atmospheric conditions and aerosol content. In
short, the current sky background model is in fair agreement with the observations, and we have determined
better aerosol extinction curves and phase functions for Cerro Paranal.
