ABRIDGED: We have used the LABOCA Survey of the ECDF-S (LESS) to investigate rest-frame FIR emission
from typical SF systems (LBGs) at redshift 3, 4, and 5. We initially concentrate on LBGs at z~3 and
select three subsamples on stellar mass, extinction corrected SF and rest-frame UV-magnitude.
We produce composite 870micron images of the typical source in our subsamples, obtaining ~4sigma
detections and suggesting a correlation between FIR luminosity and stellar mass. We apply a similar
procedure to our full samples at z~3, 4, 4.5 and 5 and do not obtain detections - consistent with a simple
scaling between FIR luminosity and stellar mass. In order to constrain the FIR SED of these systems
we explore their emission at multiple wavelengths spanning the peak of dust emission at z~3 using
the Herschel SPIRE observations of the field. We obtain detections at multiple wavelengths for
both our stellar mass and UV-magnitude selected samples, and find a best-fit SED with T_dust in the
~33-41K range. We calculate L_FIR, obscured SFRs and M_dust, and find that a significant fraction
of SF in these systems is obscured. Interestingly, our extinction corrected SFR sample does not
display the large FIR fluxes predicted from its red UV-spectral slope. This suggests that the method
of assuming an intrinsic UV-slope and correcting for dust attenuation may be invalid for this sample
- and that these are not in fact the most actively SF systems. All of our z~3 samples fall on the `main
sequence' of SF galaxies at z~3 and our detected subsamples are likely to represent the high obscuration
end of LBGs at their epoch. We compare the FIR properties of our subsamples with various other populations,
finding that our stellar mass selected sample shows similar FIR characteristics to SMGs at the same
epoch and therefore potentially represents the low L_FIR end of the high redshift FIR luminosity
function.
