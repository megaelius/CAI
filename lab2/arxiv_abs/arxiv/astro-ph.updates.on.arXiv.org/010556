The bright quasar PG1302-102 has been identified as a candidate supermassive black hole binary
from its near-sinusoidal optical variability. While the significance of its optical periodicity
has been debated due to the stochastic variability of quasars, its multi-wavelength variability
in the ultraviolet (UV) and optical bands is consistent with relativistic Doppler boost caused
by the orbital motion in a binary. However, this conclusion was based previously on sparse UV data
which were not taken simultaneously with the optical data. Here we report simultaneous follow-up
observations of PG1302-102 with the Ultraviolet Optical Telescope on the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory
in six optical + UV bands. We perform a statistical analysis to further test the Doppler boost hypothesis,
which predicts that UV variability should track the optical, but with a $\sim2.2$ times higher amplitude.
We find that the additional nine Swift observations produce light curves roughly consistent with
this trend. The data are consistent with the Doppler boost hypothesis when we compare the optical
B-band and UV light curves. However, the ratio of UV to V-band variability is larger than expected
and is consistent with the Doppler model, only if either the UV/optical spectral slopes vary, the
stochastic variability makes a large contribution in the UV, or the sparse new optical data underestimate
the true optical variability. We have evidence for the latter from comparison with the optical light
curve from ASAS-SN. Additional, simultaneous optical + UV observations tracing out another cycle
of the 5.2-year proposed periodicity should lead to a definitive conclusion.
