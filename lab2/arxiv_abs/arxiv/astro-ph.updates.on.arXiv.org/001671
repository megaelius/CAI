We present multiwavelength photometry, high angular resolution imaging, and radial velocities,
of the unique and confounding disintegrating low-mass planet candidate KIC 12557548b. Our high
angular resolution imaging, which includes spacebased HST/WFC3 observations in the optical,
and groundbased Keck/NIRC2 observations in K'-band, allow us to rule-out background and foreground
candidates at angular separations greater than 0.2 arcsec that are bright enough to be responsible
for the transits we associate with KIC 12557548. Our radial velocity limit from Keck/HIRES allows
us to rule-out bound, low-mass stellar companions to KIC 12557548 on orbits less than 10 years, as
well as placing an upper-limit on the mass of the candidate planet of 1.2 Jupiter masses; therefore,
the combination of our radial velocities, high angular-resolution imaging, and photometry are
able to rule-out most false positive interpretations of the transits. Our precise multiwavelength
photometry includes two simultaneous detections of the transit of KIC 12557548b using CFHT/WIRCam
at 2.15 microns and the Kepler space telescope at 0.6 microns, as well as simultaneous null-detections
of the transit by Kepler and HST/WFC3 at 1.4 microns. Our simultaneous HST/WFC3 and Kepler null-detections,
provide no evidence for radically different transit depths at these wavelengths. Our simultaneous
CFHT/WIRCam detections in the near-infrared and with Kepler in the optical reveal very similar
transit depths (the average ratio of the transit depths at ~2.15 microns compared to ~0.6 microns
is: 1.02 +/- 0.20). This suggests that if the transits we observe are due to scattering from single-size
particles streaming from the planet in a comet-like tail, then the particles must be ~0.5 microns
in radius or larger, which would favor that KIC 12557548b is a sub-Mercury, rather than super-Mercury,
mass planet.
