Our current understanding of the final stages of massive star evolution is largely incomplete,
particularly in low metallicity environments. To improve upon this, we investigate the behavior
of a suspected LBV in one of the most metal-poor dwarf galaxies, PHL 293B. Excitingly, we find the
sudden disappearance of the LBV signature from our spectra obtained in 2019. Spectroscopic observations
of PHL 293B between 2001 and 2009 consistently revealed both narrow and broad strong emission components
in the hydrogen Balmer lines, with minimal variation between observations. These broad components
combined with P Cygni profiles have been associated with a massive Luminous Blue Variable (LBV)
star. However, such features are absent from our spectra obtained in 2019 with the ESPRESSO and X-shooter
instruments of the ESO's VLT, as well as archival data from 2011 and 2016. We compute radiative transfer
models using CMFGEN that fit the observed spectrum of the LBV. This reveals that during 2001-2009
the LBV had a luminosity $L_* = 2.5-5.0 \times 10^6 L_{\odot}$, a mass-loss rate $\dot{M} = 0.005-0.020
M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, a stellar wind velocity of 1000 km s$^{-1}$, and an effective temperature
$T_\mathrm{eff} = 6000-6800$ K. These values indicate an eruptive state. We consider two main hypotheses
for the absence of the broad emission components from the spectra obtained since 2011. One possibility
is that we are seeing the end of an LBV eruption of a surviving star, with a mild drop in luminosity,
a shift to hotter effective temperatures, and some dust obscuration. Alternatively, the LBV could
have collapsed to a massive black hole without the production of a bright supernova.
