The centrifugal acceleration is due to the rotating poloidal magnetic field in the magnetosphere
creates the electric field which is orthogonal to the magnetic field. Charged particles with finite
cyclotron radii can move along the electric field and receive energy. Centrifugal acceleration
pushes particles to the periphery, where their azimuthal velocity reaches the light speed. We have
calculated particle trajectories by numerical and analytical methods. The maximum obtained energies
depend on the parameter of the particle magnetization $ \kappa $, which is the ratio of rotation frequency
of magnetic field lines in the magnetosphere $ \Omega_F $ to non-relativistic cyclotron frequency
of particles $ \omega_c $, $ \kappa = \Omega_F /\omega_c << 1 $, and from the parameter $ \alpha $ which
is the ratio of toroidal magnetic field $ B_T $ to the poloidal one $ B_P $, $ \alpha = B_T / B_P $. It is
shown that for small toroidal fields, $ \alpha <\kappa^{1/4} $, the maximum Lorentz factor $ \gamma_m
$ is only the square root of magnetization, $ \gamma_m = \kappa^{-1/2} $, while for large toroidal
fields, $ \alpha >\kappa^{1/4} $, the energy increases significantly, $ \gamma_m = \kappa^{-2/3}
$. However, the maximum possible acceleration, $ \gamma_m = \kappa^{-1} $, is not achieved in the
magnetosphere. For a number of active galactic nuclei, such as M87, maximum values of Lorentz factor
for accelerated protons are found. Also for special case of Sgr. A* estimations of the maximum proton
energy and its energy flux are obtained. They are in agreement with experimental data obtained by
HESS Cherenkov telescope.
