Mechanisms of planet formation are still under debate.Little we know about how planets form, even
if $\sim$4000 exoplanets have been detected.Recent investigations target the cot of new born planets:
the protoplanetary disk.At the first stages of their life,exoplanets are still accreting material
from the gas rich disk.Transitional disks are indeed disks that show peculiarities such as gaps,spiral
arms,rings which can be connected to the presence of substellar companions.To investigate on the
responsible(s) of these features,we selected all the known TDs in the solar neighborhood (<200
pc) visible from the Southern hemisphere.We conducted a survey of 11 TDs with SPHERE.This is the
largest Ha survey to look for protoplanets conducted so far.The observations were performed with
the Ha filter of ZIMPOL,to target protoplanets that are still in the accretion stage.All the selected
targets are very young stars(<20 Myr), and show low extinction in the visible.We reduced the pupil
stabilized data applying the method of the ADI,which combines angular and spectral differential
imaging.The datacubes are composed of the CntHa and the Ha filter taken simultaneously, to permit
the suppression of the speckle pattern.PCA method was employed for the reduction of the data. For
each dataset we derived the contrast limit and convert it in upper limits on the accretion luminosity.We
do not detect any new accreting substellar companion around the targeted transition disks down
to an average contrast of 12 mag at 0,2'' from the central star.We recovered the signal of the accreting
companion around the star HD142527.We have resolved for the first time the quadruple system HD98800.For
each other system we can exclude the presence of massive actively accreting companions,assuming
that the accretion is not episodic and that the extinction is negligible.The mean accretion luminosity
limit is 10e-6 L_S at 0,2''.
