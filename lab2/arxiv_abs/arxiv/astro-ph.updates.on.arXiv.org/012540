We infer the collapse times of long-lived neutron stars into black holes using the X-ray afterglows
of 18 short gamma-ray bursts. We then apply hierarchical inference to infer properties of the neutron
star equation of state and dominant spin-down mechanism. We measure the maximum non-rotating neutron
star mass $M_\mathrm{TOV} = 2.31 ^{+0.36}_{-0.21} M_{\odot}$ and constrain the fraction of remnants
spinning down predominantly through gravitational-wave emission to $\eta = 0.69 ^{+0.21}_{-0.39}$
with $68 \%$ uncertainties. In principle, this method can determine the difference between hadronic
and quark equation of states. In practice, however, the data is not yet informative with indications
that these neutron stars do not have hadronic equation of states at the $1\sigma$ level. These inferences
all depend on the underlying progenitor mass distribution for short gamma-ray bursts produced
by binary neutron star mergers. The recently announced gravitational-wave detection of GW190425
suggests this underlying distribution is different from the locally-measured population of double
neutron stars. We show that $M_\mathrm{TOV}$ and $\eta$ constraints depend on the fraction of binary
mergers that form through a distribution consistent with the locally-measured population and
a distribution that can explain GW190425. The more binaries that form from the latter distribution,
the larger $M_\mathrm{TOV}$ needs to be to satisfy the X-ray observations. Our measurements above
are marginalised over this unknown fraction. If instead, we assume GW190425 is not a binary neutron
star merger, i.e the underlying mass distribution of double neutron stars is the same as observed
locally, we measure $M_\mathrm{TOV} = 2.26 ^{+0.31}_{-0.17} M_{\odot}$.
