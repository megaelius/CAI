We report the first systematic study of the submillimeter water vapor rotational emission lines
in infrared (IR) galaxies based on the Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) data of {\it Herschel}
SPIRE. Among the 176 galaxies with publicly available FTS data, 45 have at least one H$_2$O emission
line detected. The H$_2$O line luminosities range from $\sim 1 \times 10^5$ $L_{\odot}$ to $\sim
5 \times 10^7 L_{\odot}$ while the total IR luminosities ($L_\mathrm{IR}$) have a similar spread
($\sim 1-300 \times 10^{10} L_{\odot}$). In addition, emission lines of H$_2$O$^+$ and H$_2^{18}$O
are also detected. H$_2$O is found, for most galaxies, to be the strongest molecular emitter after
CO in FTS spectra. The luminosity of the five most important H$_2$O lines is near-linearly correlated
with $L_\mathrm{IR}$, no matter whether strong active galactic nucleus signature is present or
not. However, the luminosity of H$_2$O($2_{11}-2_{02}$) and H$_2$O($2_{20}-2_{11}$) appears
to increase slightly faster than linear with $L_\mathrm{IR}$. Although the slope turns out to be
slightly steeper when $z\sim 2-4$ ULIRGs are included, the correlation is still closely linear.
We find that $L_\mathrm{H_2O}/L_\mathrm{IR}$ decreases with increasing $f_{25}/f_{60}$, but
see no dependence on $f_{60}/f_{100}$, possibly indicating that very warm dust contributes little
to the excitation of the submillimeter H$_2$O lines. The average spectral line energy distribution
(SLED) of the entire sample is consistent with individual SLEDs and the IR pumping plus collisional
excitation model, showing that the strongest lines are H$_2$O($2_{02}-1_{11}$) and H$_2$O($3_{21}-3_{12}$).
