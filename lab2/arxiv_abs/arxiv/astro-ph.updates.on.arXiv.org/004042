We analyze the parsec-scale jet kinematics from 2007 June to 2013 January of a sample of $\gamma$-ray
bright blazars monitored roughly monthly with the Very Long Baseline Array at 43~GHz. In a total
of 1929 images, we measure apparent speeds of 252 emission knots in 21 quasars, 12 BL~Lacertae objects
(BLLacs), and 3 radio galaxies, ranging from 0.02$c$ to 78$c$; 21\% of the knots are quasi-stationary.
Approximately 1/3 of the moving knots execute non-ballistic motions, with the quasars exhibiting
acceleration along the jet within 5~pc (projected) of the core, and knots in the BLLacs tending to
decelerate near the core. Using apparent speeds of components and timescales of variability from
their light curves, we derive physical parameters of 120 superluminal knots, including variability
Doppler factors, Lorentz factors, and viewing angles. We estimate the half-opening angle of each
jet based on the projected opening angle and scatter of intrinsic viewing angles of knots. We determine
characteristic values of physical parameters for each jet and AGN class based on the range of values
obtained for individual features. We calculate intrinsic brightness temperatures of the cores,
$T_{\rm b,int}^{\rm core}$, at all epochs, finding that the radio galaxies usually maintain equipartition
conditions in the cores, while $\sim$30\% of $T_{\rm b,int}^{\rm core}$ measurements in the quasars
and BLLacs deviate from equipartition values by a factor $>$10. This probably occurs during transient
events connected with active states. In the Appendix we briefly describe the behavior of each blazar
during the period analyzed.
