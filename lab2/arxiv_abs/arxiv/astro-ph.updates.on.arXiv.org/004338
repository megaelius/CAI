Exoplanet hunting efforts have revealed the prevalence of exotic worlds with diverse properties,
including temperate Earth-sized bodies, fueling our endeavor to search for life beyond the Solar
System. Accumulating experiences in astrophysical, chemical, and climatological characterization
of uninhabitable planets are paving the way to characterization of astrobiologically motivated
targets. In this paper, we explore our roadmap toward the comprehensive assessment of temperate
terrestrial planets for the potential of life by reviewing the proposed methods and surveying the
future observational capabilities. We discuss the observability of not only the proposed biosignature
candidates themselves, but also of more general planetary properties that provide circumstantial
evidence, since the evaluation of any biosignature candidate relies on their context. Characterization
of temperate Earth-size planets in the coming years will focus on those around nearby low-mass stars.
JWST and later 30 meter-class ground-based telescopes will empower their chemical investigations.
Spectroscopic studies of potentially habitable planets around Sun-like stars will likely require
a designated spacecraft mission for direct imaging, with the first possibility being WFIRST. Successful
initial characterization of a few nearby targets will be an important touchstone toward a more detailed
scrutiny and a larger survey that are envisioned beyond 2030. The broad outlook this paper presents
may help develop new observational techniques to detect relevant features as well as frameworks
to diagnose planets based on the observables.
