We aim to determine the relative angle between the total angular momentum of the minor planets and
that of the Sun-planets system, and to improve the orientation of the invariable plane of the solar
system. By utilizing physical parameters available in public domain archives, we assigned reasonable
masses to 718041 minor planets throughout the solar system, including near-Earth objects, main
belt asteroids, Jupiter trojans, trans-Neptunian objects, scattered-disk objects, and centaurs.
Then we combined the orbital data to calibrate the angular momenta of these small bodies, and evaluated
the specific contribution of the massive dwarf planets. The effects of uncertainties on the mass
determination and the observational incompleteness were also estimated. We determine the total
angular momentum of the known minor planets to be $1.7817\times10^{46}$ g $\cdot$ cm$^2$ $\cdot$
s$^{-1}$. The relative angle $\alpha$ between this vector and the total angular momentum of the
Sun-planets system is calculated to be 14.74 deg.. By excluding the dwarf planets Eris, Pluto, and
Haumea, which have peculiar angular momentum directions, $\alpha$ drops sharply to 1.76 deg.;
a similar result applies to each individual minor planet group. This suggests that, without these
three most massive bodies, the plane perpendicular to the total angular momentum of the minor planets
would be close to the invariable plane of the solar system. On the other hand, the inclusion of Eris,
Haumea, and Makemake can produce a difference of 1254 mas in the inclination of the invariable plane,
which is much larger than the difference of 9 mas induced by Ceres, Vesta, and Pallas as found previously.
By taking into account the angular momentum contributions from all minor planets, including unseen
ones, the orientation improvement of the invariable plane is larger than 1000 mas in inclination
with a $1\sigma$ error of 50-140 mas.
