A crucial challenge to successful flare prediction is forecasting periods that transition between
"flare-quiet" and "flare-active". Building on earlier studies in this series (Barnes et al. 2016;
Leka et al. 2019a,b) in which we describe methodology, details, and results of flare forecasting
comparison efforts, we focus here on patterns of forecast outcomes (success and failure) over multi-day
periods. A novel analysis is developed to evaluate forecasting success in the context of catching
the first event of flare-active periods, and conversely, of correctly predicting declining flare
activity. We demonstrate these evaluation methods graphically and quantitatively as they provide
both quick comparative evaluations and options for detailed analysis. For the testing interval
2016-2017, we determine the relative frequency distribution of two-day dichotomous forecast
outcomes for three different event histories (i.e., event/event, no-event/event and event/no-event),
and use it to highlight performance differences between forecasting methods. A trend is identified
across all forecasting methods that a high/low forecast probability on day-1 remains high/low
on day-2 even though flaring activity is transitioning. For M-class and larger flares, we find that
explicitly including persistence or prior flare history in computing forecasts helps to improve
overall forecast performance. It is also found that using magnetic/modern data leads to improvement
in catching the first-event/first-no-event transitions. Finally, 15% of major (i.e., M-class
or above) flare days over the testing interval were effectively missed due to a lack of observations
from instruments away from the Earth-Sun line.
