The current Hubble constant tension is usually presented by comparing constraints on $H_0$ only.
However, the post-recombination background cosmic evolution is determined by two parameters
in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and today's matter energy fraction
($\Omega_{\rm{m}}$). If we therefore compare all constraints individually in the $H_0$-$\Omega_{\rm{m}}$
plane, (1) various constraints can be treated as independently as possible, (2) single-sided constraints
are easier to consider, (3) compatibility among different constraints can be viewed in a more robust
way, and (4) whether or not a nonstandard model is able to reconcile all constraints in tension can
be seen more effectively. We perform a systematic comparison of independent constraints in the
$H_0$-$\Omega_{\rm{m}}$ space based on a flat $\Lambda$CDM model. Constraints along different
degeneracy directions consistently overlap in one region of the space, with the exception of the
local measurement from Cepheid variable-calibrated supernovae. Due to the different responses
of individual constraints to a modified model, it is difficult for nonstandard models with modifications
at high-, mid- or low-redshifts to reconcile all constraints if none of them have unaccounted-for
systematic effects. Based on our analysis, the local measurement is the most outlying and therefore
drives the bulk of the tension. This may suggest that the most likely solution to the tension is an
alteration to the local result, either due to some previously unseen feature in our local cosmic
environment, or some other unknown systematic effect.
