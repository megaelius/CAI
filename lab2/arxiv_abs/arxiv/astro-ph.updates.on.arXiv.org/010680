In current models used to interpret exoplanet atmospheric observations, the planetary mass is
treated as a prior and is estimated independently with external methods (e.g: radial velocity or
Transit Timing Variation techniques). This approach is necessary as available spectroscopic
data do not have sufficient wavelength coverage and/or signal to noise to infer the planetary mass.
We examine here whether the planetary mass can be directly retrieved from higher quality transit
spectra as observed by future space observatories. More in general, we quantify the impact of mass
uncertainties on spectral retrieval analyses. Our approach is analytical and numerical: we first
extract analytically the influence of each parameter to the wavelength-dependent transit depth.
We then adopt a fully Bayesian retrieval model to quantify the propagation of the mass uncertainty
onto other atmospheric parameters. We found that for clear-sky, gaseous atmospheres the posterior
distributions are the same when the mass is known or retrieved. The retrieved mass is very accurate,
with a precision of more than 10%, provided the wavelength coverage and S/N are adequate. When opaque
clouds are included, the uncertainties in the retrieved mass increase but atmospheric parameters
such as the temperature and trace-gas abundances are unaffected by the knowledge of the mass. Secondary
atmospheres are more challenging due to the higher degree of freedom for the atmospheric main component.
For broad wavelength range and adequate signal to noise, the mass can still be retrieved accurately
if clouds are not present, and so are all the other atmospheric parameters. When clouds are added,
mass uncertainties may impact substantially the retrieval of the mean molecular weight: an independent
characterisation of the mass would therefore be helpful to capture the main atmospheric constituent.
