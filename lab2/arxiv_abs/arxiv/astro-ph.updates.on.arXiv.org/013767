We present the first Hubble diagram of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) out to a redshift of two,
together with constraints on the matter density, $\Omega_{\rm M}$, and the dark energy equation-of-state
parameter, $w(\equiv p/\rho)$. We build a sample of 20 cosmologically useful SLSNe~I based on light
curve and spectroscopy quality cuts. We confirm the robustness of the peak decline SLSN~I standardization
relation with a larger dataset and improved fitting techniques than previous works. We then solve
the SLSN model based on the above standardisation via minimisation of the $\chi^2$ computed from
a covariance matrix which includes statistical and systematic uncertainties. For a spatially
flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, we find $\Omega_{\rm M}=0.44^{+0.21}_{-0.21}$, with
a rms of 0.28 mag for the residuals of the distance moduli. For an $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological model,
the addition of SLSNe~I to a `baseline' measurement consisting of Planck temperature and WMAP polarization
of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuation together with type Ia supernovae, results
in a small improvement in the constraints of $w_0$ and $w_a$ of 4\%. We present simulations of future
surveys with 847 SLSNe I and show that such a sample can deliver cosmological constraints in a flat
$\Lambda$CDM model with the same precision (considering only statistical uncertainties) as current
surveys that use type Ia supernovae, while providing an improvement of 15\% in the constraints on
the time variation of dark energy, $w_0$ and $w_a$. This paper represents the proof-of-concept
for superluminous supernova cosmology, and demonstrates they can provide an independent test
of cosmology in the high-redshift ($z>1$) universe.
