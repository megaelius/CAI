Anomalous surface abundances are observed in a fraction of the low-mass stars of Galactic globular
clusters, that may originate from hot-hydrogen-burning products ejected by a previous generation
of massive stars. We present and investigate a scenario in which the second generation of polluted
low-mass stars can form in shells around cool supergiant stars within a young globular cluster.
Simulations of low-Z massive stars (M$_{\rm i}\sim$ 150$-$600 M$_{\odot}$) show that both core-hydrogen-burning
cool supergiants and hot ionizing stellar sources are expected to be present simulaneously in young
globular clusters. Under these conditions, photoionization-confined shells form around the
supergiants. We find that the shell is gravitationally unstable on a timescale that is shorter than
the lifetime of the supergiant, and the Bonnor-Ebert mass of the overdense regions is low enough
to allow star formation. Since the low-mass stellar generation formed in this shell is made up of
the material lost from the supergiant, its composition necessarily reflects the composition of
the supergiant wind. We show that the wind contains hot-hydrogen-burning products, and that the
shell-stars therefore have very similar abundance anomalies that are observed in the second generation
stars of globular clusters. Considering the mass-budget required for the second generation star-formation,
we offer two solutions. Either a top-heavy initial mass function is needed with an index of $-$1.71..$-$2.07.
Alternatively, we suggest the shell-stars to have a truncated mass distribution, and solve the
mass budget problem by justifiably accounting for only a fraction of the first generation. Even
without forming a photoionizaton-confined shell, the cool supergiant stars predicted at low-Z
could contribute to the pollution of the interstellar medium of the cluster from which the second
generation was born.
