XMM-Newton has observed the X-ray sky since early 2000. The XMM-Newton Survey Science Centre Consortium
has published catalogues of X-ray and ultraviolet sources found serendipitously in the individual
observations. This series is now augmented by a catalogue dedicated to X-ray sources detected in
spatially overlapping XMM-Newton observations. The aim of this catalogue is to explore repeatedly
observed sky regions. It thus makes use of the long(er) effective exposure time per sky area and offers
the opportunity to investigate long-term flux variability directly through the source detection
process. A new standardised strategy for simultaneous source detection on multiple observations
is introduced. It is coded as a new task within the XMM-Newton Science Analysis System and used to
compile a catalogue of sources from 434 stacks comprising 1,789 overlapping XMM-Newton observations
that entered the 3XMM-DR7 catalogue, have a low background and full-frame readout of all EPIC cameras.
The first stacked catalogue is called 3XMM-DR7s. It contains 71,951 unique sources with positions
and parameters such as fluxes, hardness ratios, quality estimates, and information on inter-observation
variability. About 15% of the sources are new with respect to 3XMM-DR7. Through stacked source detection,
the parameters of repeatedly observed sources can be determined with higher accuracy than in the
individual observations. The method is more sensitive to faint sources and tends to produce fewer
spurious detections. With this first stacked catalogue we demonstrate the feasibility and benefit
of the approach. It supplements the large data base of XMM-Newton detections by additional, in particular
faint, sources and adds variability information. In the future, the catalogue will be expanded
to larger samples and continued within the series of serendipitous XMM-Newton source catalogues.
