Mass-radius relationships for water-rich rocky planets are usually calculated assuming most
water is present in condensed (either liquid or solid) form. Planet density estimates are then compared
to these mass-radius relationships, even when these planets are more irradiated than the runaway
greenhouse irradiation limit (around 1.1~times the insolation at Earth for planets orbiting a
Sun-like star), for which water has been shown to be unstable in condensed form and would instead
form a thick H2O-dominated atmosphere. Here we use the LMD Generic numerical climate model to derive
new mass-radius relationships appropriate for water-rich rocky planets that are more irradiated
than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit, meaning planets endowed with a steam, water-dominated
atmosphere. For a given water-to-rock mass ratio, these new mass-radius relationships lead to
planet bulk densities much lower than calculated when water is assumed to be in condensed form. In
other words, using traditional mass-radius relationships for planets that are more irradiated
than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit tends to dramatically overestimate -- possibly
by several orders of magnitude -- their bulk water content. In particular, this result applies to
TRAPPIST-1 b, c, and d, which can accommodate a water mass fraction of at most 2, 0.3 and 0.08 %, respectively,
assuming planetary core with a terrestrial composition. In addition, we show that significant
changes of mass-radius relationships (between planets less and more irradiated than the runaway
greenhouse limit) can be used to remove bulk composition degeneracies in multiplanetary systems
such as TRAPPIST-1. Finally, we provide an empirical formula for the H2O steam atmosphere thickness
which can be used to construct mass-radius relationships for any water-rich, rocky planet more
irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation threshold.
