We analyze the process of planetary scattering around M0-type stars. To do this, we carry out N-body
simulations with three Jupiter-mass planets close to their instability limit together with an
outer planetesimal disk. This paper focuses on the analysis of systems in which a single Jupiter-mass
planet survives after the dynamical instability event. The small body reservoirs show different
dynamical behaviors. In fact, our simulations produce particles on prograde and retrograde orbits,
as well as particles whose orbital plane flips from prograde to retrograde and back again along their
evolution. Such particles are called "Type-F particles". We find strong correlations between
the inclination $i$ and the ascending node longitude $\Omega$ of such particles. First, $\Omega$
librates around 90$^{\circ}$ or/and 270$^{\circ}$. This property is very important since it represents
a necessary and sufficient condition for the flipping of an orbit. Moreover, the libration periods
of $i$ and $\Omega$ are equal and they are out to phase by a quarter period. We also remark that the larger
the libration amplitude of $i$, the larger the libration amplitude of $\Omega$. Finally, we analyze
the initial conditions of Type-F particles of all our simulations immediately after the dynamical
instability event, when a single Jupiter-mass planet survives in the system. We carry out this study
with the goal to determine the parameter space that lead to the flipping of an orbit. Our results suggest
that the orbit of a test particle can flip for any value of its initial eccentricity, although we found
only two Type-F particles with initial inclinations $i <$ 17$^{\circ}$. Moreover, our study indicates
that the minimum value of the inclination of the Type-F particles in a given system decreases with
an increase in the eccentricity of the giant planet.
