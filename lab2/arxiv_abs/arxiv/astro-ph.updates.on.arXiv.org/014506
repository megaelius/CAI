Synchronously orbiting, tidally-locked exoplanets with a dayside facing their star and a permanently
dark nightside orbiting dim stars are prime candidates for habitability. Simulations of these
planets often show the potential to maintain an Earth-like climate with a complete hydrological
cycle. Here, we examine the sensitivity of the atmospheric water cycle to changes in stellar flux
and describe the main underlying mechanisms. In a slowly-rotating, tidally-locked Earth-like
atmospheric model, the response to a small (about 10%) increase in stellar irradiance from a habitable-zone
control simulation is examined. The water cycle is enhanced in response to the increased stellar
irradiance. While the evaporation increase behaves similarly to the stellar radiation increase,
the day-to-night energy transport by the mean circulation is critical to the planet's precipitation
changes. Increased efficiency of the energy transport in a warmer climate shapes the substellar
precipitation increase. On the nightside, precipitation changes are weak as a result of the large
cancellation between the increased energy transport and the increased longwave emission. The
day-to-night energy transport efficiency is sensitive to the variation of the atmosphere's vertical
stratification. Due to weak temperature gradients in upper troposphere and a moist adiabat maintained
in the substellar region, variations in the substellar surface temperature and specific humidity
govern the increase of the planet's stratification with warming. This suggests a scaling of nightside's
precipitation based on the substellar surface thermodynamic changes, a sensitivity that holds
over a wider range of stellar irradiance changes.
