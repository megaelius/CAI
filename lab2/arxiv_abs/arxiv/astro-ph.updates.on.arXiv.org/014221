Combining high time and frequency resolution full-polarisation spectra of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)
with knowledge of their host galaxy properties provides an opportunity to study both the emission
mechanism generating them and the impact of their propagation through their local environment,
host galaxy, and the intergalactic medium. The Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP)
telescope has provided the first ensemble of bursts with this information. In this paper, we present
the high time and spectral resolution, full polarisation observations of five localised FRBs to
complement the results published for the previously studied ASKAP FRB~181112. We find that every
FRB is highly polarised, with polarisation fractions ranging from 80 -- 100\%, and that they are
generally dominated by linear polarisation. While some FRBs in our sample exhibit properties associated
with an emerging archetype (i.e., repeating or apparently non-repeating), others exhibit characteristic
features of both, implying the existence of a continuum of FRB properties. When examined at high
time resolution, we find that all FRBs in our sample have evidence for multiple sub-components and
for scattering at a level greater than expected from the Milky Way. We find no correlation between
the diverse range of FRB properties (e.g., scattering time, intrinsic width, and rotation measure)
and any global property of their host galaxy. The most heavily scattered bursts reside in the outskirts
of their host galaxies, suggesting that the source-local environment rather than the host interstellar
medium is likely the dominant origin of the scattering in our sample.
