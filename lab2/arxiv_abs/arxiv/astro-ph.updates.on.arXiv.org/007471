We investigate the effect on the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) from the presence of a stochastic
primordial magnetic field (PMF) whose strength is spatially inhomogeneous. We assume a uniform
total energy density and a gaussian distribution of field strength. In this case, domains of different
temperatures exist in the BBN epoch due to variations in the local PMF. We show that in such case, the
effective distribution function of particle velocities averaged over domains of different temperatures
deviates from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. This deviation is related to the scale invariant
strength of the PMF energy density $\rho_{\rm Bc}$ and the fluctuation parameter $\sigma_{\rm
B}$. We perform BBN network calculations taking into account the PMF strength distribution, and
deduce the element abundances as functions of the baryon-to-photon ratio $\eta$, $\rho_{\rm Bc}$,
and $\sigma_{\rm B}$. We find that the fluctuations of the PMF reduces the $^7$Be production and
enhances D production. We analyze the averaged thermonuclear reaction rates compared with those
of a single temperature, and find that the averaged charged-particle reaction rates are very different.
Finally, we constrain the parameters $\rho_{\rm Bc}$ and $\sigma_{\rm B}$ for our fluctuating
PMF model from observed abundances of $^4$He and D. In this model, the $^7$Li abundance is significantly
reduced. We also discuss the possibility that the baryon-to-photon ratio decreased after the BBN
epoch. In this case, we find that if the $\eta$ value during BBN was larger than the present-day value,
all produced light elements are consistent with observational constraints.
