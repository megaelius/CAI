One key ingredient in using galaxy clusters (GCs) as a precision cosmological probe in large X-ray
surveys is to understand selection effects. The dependence of the X-ray emission on the square of
the gas density leads to a predominant role of GC cool cores in the detection. The contribution of
cool cores to the X-ray luminosity does not scale with GC mass and cosmology and therefore affects
the use of X-ray GCs in producing cosmological constraints. One of the main science goals of the eROSITA
mission is to constrain cosmology with a wide X-ray survey. We propose an eROSITA GC detection scheme
that avoids the use of X-ray GC centers in detection. We calculate theoretical expectations and
characterize the performance of this scheme by simulations. Performing realistic simulations
of point sources (PSs) in survey mode we search for spatial scales where the extended signal is uncontaminated
by the PS flux. We derive a combination of scales and thresholds, which result in a clean extended
source catalog. We design the output of the GC detection which enables calibrating the core-excised
luminosity using external mass measurements. We provide a way to incorporate the results of this
calibration in the production of final core-excised luminosity. Similarly to other GC detection
pipelines, we sample the flux - core radius detection space of our method and find many similarities
with the pipeline used in the 400d survey. Both detection methods require large statistics on compact
GCs, in order to reduce the contamination from PSs. The benefit of our pipeline consists in the sensitivity
to the outer GC shapes, which are characterized by large core sizes with little GC to GC variation
at a fixed total mass. Galaxy cluster detection by outskirts improves the GC characterization using
eROSITA survey data and is expected to yield well characterized GC catalogs having simple selection
functions.
