The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will enable the detection of optical emission lines in galaxies
spanning a broad range of luminosities out to redshifts z > 10. Measurements of key galaxy properties,
such as star formation rate and metallicity, through these observations will provide unique insight
into, e.g., the role of feedback from stars and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in regulating galaxy
evolution, the co-evolution of AGNs and host galaxies, the physical origin of the "main sequence"
of star-forming galaxies and the contribution by star-forming galaxies to cosmic reionization.
We present an original framework to simulate and analyse observations performed with the Near Infrared
Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board JWST. We use the beagle tool (BayEsian Analysis of GaLaxy sEds)
to build a semi-empirical catalogue of galaxy spectra based on photometric spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of dropout galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). We demonstrate that the resulting
catalogue of galaxy spectra satisfies different types of observational constraints on high-redshift
galaxies, and use it as input to simulate NIRSpec/prism (R~100) observations. We show that a single
"deep" (~100 ks) NIRSpec/prism pointing in the HUDF will enable S/N > 3 detections of multiple optical
emission lines in ~30 (~60) galaxies at z > 6 (z~ 4-6) down to F160W < 30 mag AB. Such observations will
allow measurements of galaxy star formation rates, ionization parameters and gas-phase metallicities
within factors of 1.5, mass-to-light ratios within a factor of 2, galaxy ages within a factor of 3
and V-band attenuation optical depths with a precision of 0.3.
