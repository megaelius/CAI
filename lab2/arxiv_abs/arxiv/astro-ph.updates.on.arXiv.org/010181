Feedback from high-mass stars shapes the ISM of galaxies and thereby impacts gas that will form future
generations of stars. However, due to our inability to track the time evolution of individual molecular
clouds, quantifying the exact role of feedback on their star formation history is an observationally
challenging task. In the present study, we take advantage of the unique properties of the G316.75-00.00
high-mass star-forming ridge to determine how feedback from O-stars impacts the dynamical stability
of filaments. G316.75 is a 13.6pc long ridge containing 18,900Msun of H2 gas which is half IR dark,
half IR bright. The IR bright half has already formed 4 O-type stars over the past 2Myr, while the IR
dark half is still quiescent. Therefore, by assuming the gas properties of the dark part represents
an earlier evolutionary stage of the bright part, we can quantify how feedback impacts these properties
by contrasting them. We use archive Herschel and molecular line data, tracing both dense (NH3 and
N2H+) and more diffuse (13CO) gas, to measure the ratio of kinetic to gravitational energy per-unit-length,
virial-ratio-per-line, across the ridge for a range of gas volume densities. We show that despite
the presence of 4 embedded O-stars, feedback cannot unbind the ridge's mass except for some small
gas pockets near the O-stars. In fact, the virial-ratio-per-line is almost indistinguishable
for both parts of the ridge. These results are at odds with most simulations where O-star-forming
clouds are dispersed by feedback within a few cloud free-fall time. We conclude that the discrepancy
between such simulations and our observations originates from different cloud morphologies and
average densities when the first O-star forms. These results have important implications regarding,
for instance, how feedback is implemented within cosmological and galactic-scale simulations.
