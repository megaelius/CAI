The influence of the Cosmic Web on galaxy formation and evolution is of great observational and theoretical
interest. We investigate whether the Cosmic Web leaves an imprint in the spatial clustering of galaxies
in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), using the group catalog of Yang et al. and tidal field estimates
at $\sim2h^{-1}$Mpc scales from the Mass-Tides-Velocity data set of Wang et al. We use the $\textit{tidal
anisotropy}$ $\alpha$ (Paranjape et al.) to characterise the tidal environment of groups, and
measure the redshift-space 2-point correlation function (2pcf) of group positions and the luminosity-
and colour-dependent clustering of group galaxies using samples segregated by $\alpha$. We find
that all the 2pcf measurements depend strongly on $\alpha$, with factors of $\sim20$ between the
large-scale 2pcf of objects in the most and least isotropic environments. To test whether these
strong trends imply `beyond halo mass' effects for galaxy evolution, we compare our results with
corresponding 2pcf measurements in mock catalogs constructed using a halo occupation distribution
that only uses halo mass as an input. We find that this prescription qualitatively reproduces $\textit{all}$
observed trends, and also quantitatively matches many of the observed results. Although there
are some statistically significant differences between our `halo mass only' mocks and the data
-- in the most and least isotropic environments -- which deserve further investigation, our results
suggest that if the tidal environment induces additional effects on galaxy properties other than
those inherited from their host halos, then these must be weak.
