The aim of this work is to combine the model of orbital and rotational motion of the Moon developed
for DE430 with up-to-date astronomical, geodynamical, and geo- and selenophysical models. The
parameters of the orbit and physical libration are determined in this work from LLR observations
made at different observatories in 1970-2013. Parameters of other models are taken from solutions
that were obtained independently from LLR. A new implementation of the DE430 lunar model, including
the liquid core equations, was done within the EPM ephemeris. The postfit residuals of LLR observations
make evident that the terrestrial models and solutions recommended by the IERS Conventions are
compatible with the lunar theory. That includes: EGM2008 with conventional corrections and variations
from solid and ocean tides; displacement of stations due to solid and ocean loading tides; and precession-nutation
model. Usage of these models in the solution for LLR observations has allowed us to reduce the number
of parameters to be fit. The fixed model of tidal variations of the geopotential has resulted in a
lesser value of Moon's extra eccentricity rate, as compared to the original DE430 model with two
fit parameters. A mixed model of lunar gravitational potential was used, with some coefficients
determined from LLR observations, and other taken from the GL660b solution. Solutions obtain accurate
positions for the ranging stations and the 5 retroreflectors. Station motion is derived for sites
with long data spans. Dissipation is detected at the lunar fluid core-solid mantle boundary demonstrating
that a fluid core is present. Tidal dissipation is strong at both Earth and Moon. Consequently, the
lunar semimajor axis is expanding by 38.20 mm/yr, the tidal acceleration in mean longitude is -25.90
"/cy2, and the eccentricity is increasing by 1.48e-11 each year.
