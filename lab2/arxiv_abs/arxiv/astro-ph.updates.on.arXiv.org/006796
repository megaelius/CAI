Inelastic collisions occur among regolith particles, such as those in the ejecta curtain from a
crater, and may cause clustering or agglomeration of particles and thus produce discrete patterns
of ejecta deposits around a crater. Previous studies have shown that clusters, and even agglomerates,
are formed via mutual, inelastic collisions of spherical particles due to adhering forces between
particles in granular streams. To investigate the condition of agglomerate formation in granular
streams, we conducted laboratory experiments of granular streams using both spherical and irregular,
non-spherical particles. Measurements of particle adhesion in this study were performed using
a centrifugal separation method, in contrast to the previous study in which atomic force microscopy
(AFM) was used. This enabled simultaneous measurements of multiple particles of various shapes
for a statistical analysis of the results. With similar relative velocities and adhesion values,
irregular particles were found to form agglomerates much more easily than spherical particles.
The axial ratio of the agglomerates of spherical particles and irregular particles was similar
and was in accordance with those observed in previous laboratory studies, whereas the size of the
agglomerates of irregular particles was larger than the size of spherical particles. The degree
of agglomeration and the axial ratio of agglomerates can be used as an indicator of the shape or adhesive
force of the particles in granular stream. Our findings on agglomeration in granular streams could
provide new insights into the origin of rays on airless bodies and grooves on Phobos.
