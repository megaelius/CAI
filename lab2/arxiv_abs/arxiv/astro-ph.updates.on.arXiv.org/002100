A system of multiple open magnetic flux tubes spanning the solar photosphere and lower corona is
modelled analytically, within a realistic stratified atmosphere subject to solar gravity. This
extends results for a single magnetic flux tube in magnetohydrostatic equilibrium, described
in Gent et al. (MNRAS, 435, 689, 2013). Self-similar magnetic flux tubes are combined to form magnetic
structures, which are consistent with high-resolution observations. The observational evidence
supports the existence of strands of open flux tubes and loops persisting in a relatively steady
state. Self-similar magnetic flux tubes, for which an analytic solution to the plasma density and
pressure distribution is possible, are combined. We calculate the appropriate balancing forces,
applying to the equations of momentum and energy conservation to preserve equilibrium. Multiplex
flux tube configurations are observed to remain relatively stable for up to a day or more, and it is
our aim to apply our model as the background condition for numerical studies of energy transport
mechanisms from the solar surface to the corona. We apply magnetic field strength, plasma density,
pressure and temperature distributions consistent with observational and theoretical estimates
for the lower solar atmosphere. Although each flux tube is identical in construction apart from
the location of the radial axis, combinations can be applied to generate a non-axisymmetric magnetic
field with multiple non-uniform flux tubes. This is a considerable step forward in modelling the
realistic magnetized three-dimensional equilibria of the solar atmosphere.
