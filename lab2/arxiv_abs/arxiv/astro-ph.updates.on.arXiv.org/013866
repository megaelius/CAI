Current and upcoming cosmological experiments open a new era of precision cosmology, thus demanding
accurate theoretical predictions for cosmological observables. Because of the complexity of
the codes delivering such predictions, reaching a high level of numerical accuracy is challenging.
Among the codes already fulfilling this task, $\textsf{PyCosmo}$ is a Python based framework providing
solutions to the Einstein-Boltzmann equations and accurate predictions for cosmological observables.
In this work, we first describe how the observables are implemented. Then, we check the accuracy
of the theoretical predictions for background quantities, power spectra and Limber and beyond-Limber
angular power spectra by comparison with other codes: the Core Cosmology Library ($\texttt{CCL}$),
$\texttt{CLASS}$, $\texttt{HMCode}$ and $\texttt{iCosmo}$. In our analysis we quantify the
agreement of $\textsf{PyCosmo}$ with the other codes, for a range of cosmological models, monitored
through a series of $\textit{unit tests}$. $\textsf{PyCosmo}$, conceived as a multi purpose cosmology
calculation tool in $\texttt{Python}$, is designed to be interactive and user friendly. A current
version of the code (without the Boltzmann Solver) is publicly available and can be used interactively
on the platform $\textsf{PyCosmo Hub}$, all accessible from this link: https://cosmology.ethz.ch/research/software-lab/PyCosmo.html
. On the hub the users can perform their own computations using $\texttt{Jupyter Notebooks}$ without
the need of installing any software, access to the results presented in this work and benefit from
tutorial notebooks illustrating the usage of the code. The link above also redirects to the code
release and documentation.
