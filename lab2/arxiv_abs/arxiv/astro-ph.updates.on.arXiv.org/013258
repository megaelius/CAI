We investigate a well known scenario of interaction in the dark sector where the vacuum energy is
interacting with cold dark matter throughout the cosmic evolution in light of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) data from final Planck 2018 release. In addition to this minimal scenario, we generalize
the model baseline by including the properties of neutrinos, such as the neutrino mass scale ($M_{\nu}$)
and the effective number of neutrino species ($N_{\rm eff}$) as free parameters, in order to verify
the possible effects that such parameters might generate on the coupling parameter, and vice versa.
As already known, we again confirm that in light of the Planck 2018 data, such dark coupling can successfully
solve the $H_0$ tension (with and without the presence of neutrinos). Concerning the properties
of neutrinos, we find that $M_{\nu}$ may be wider than expected within the $\Lambda$CDM model and
$N_{\rm eff}$ is fully compatible with three neutrino species (similar to $\Lambda$CDM prevision).
The parameters characterizing the properties of neutrinos do not correlate with the coupling parameter
of the interaction model. When considering the joint analysis of CMB from Planck 2018 and an estimate
of $H_0$ from Hubble Space Telescope 2019 data, {\it we find an evidence for a non-null value of the
coupling parameter at more than 3$\sigma$ confidence-level.} We also discuss the possible effects
on the interacting scenario due to the inclusion of baryon acoustic oscillations data with Planck
2018. Our main results updating the dark sectors' interaction and neutrino properties in the model
baseline, represent a new perspective in this direction. Clearly, a possible new physics in light
of some dark interaction between dark energy and dark matter can serve as an alternative to $\Lambda$CDM
scenario to explain the observable Universe, mainly in light of the current tension on $H_0$.
