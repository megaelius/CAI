We present the discovery and early evolution of ASASSN-19bt, a tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered
by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae at a distance of $d\simeq115$ Mpc and the first TDE
to be detected by TESS. As the TDE is located in the TESS Continuous Viewing Zone, our dataset includes
30-minute cadence observations of the transient and its host dating to the start of TESS Sector 1,
and we are able to precisely determine the date when the TDE begins to brighten. Due to early discovery
by ASAS-SN and the prompt triggering of follow-up observations, our dataset also includes 18 epochs
of Swift UVOT and XRT observations, including 10 prior to peak light, XMM-Newton observations obtained
at peak, 12 spectroscopic observations (7 prior to peak), and ground data from the Las Cumbres Observatory
telescope network. ASASSN-19bt thus has the most detailed pre-peak dataset for any TDE, allowing
us to better model the early emission of a TDE than has been previously possible. From the TESS light
curve, we find that the transient began to brighten on 2019 January 21.6 and that its initial rise
was consistent with a flux $\propto t^2$ power-law model. ASASSN-19bt has optical/UV emission
that is well-fit by a blackbody SED, and it exhibits an early spike in its luminosity and temperature
roughly 31 rest-frame days before peak that has not been seen in other TDEs, possibly because UV observations
were not triggered early enough to detect it. It peaked on 2019 March 04.9 at a luminosity of $L\simeq1.3\times10^{44}$
ergs s$^{-1}$ and radiated $E\simeq3.2\times10^{50}$ ergs during the rise to peak.
