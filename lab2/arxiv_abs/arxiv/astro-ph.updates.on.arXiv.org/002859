Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are thought to drive collisionless shocks in the solar corona, which
in turn have been shown capable of accelerating solar energetic particles (SEPs) in minutes. It
has been notoriously difficult to extract information about energetic particle spectra in the
corona, due to lack of in-situ measurements. It is possible, however, to combine remote observations
with data-driven models in order to deduce coronal shock properties relevant to the local acceleration
of SEPs and their heliospheric connectivity to near-Earth space. We present such novel analysis
applied to the May 11, 2011 CME event on the western solar limb, focusing on the evolution of the eruption-driven,
dome-like shock wave observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) EUV telescopes on board
the Solar Dynamics Observatory spacecraft. We analyze the shock evolution and estimate its strength
using emission measure modeling. We apply a new method combining a geometric model of the shock front
with a potential field source surface model to estimate time-dependent field-to-shock angles
and heliospheric connectivity during shock passage in the low corona. We find that the shock was
weak, with an initial speed of ~450 km/s. It was initially mostly quasi-parallel, but significant
portion of it turned quasi-perpendicular later in the event. There was good magnetic connectivity
to near-Earth space towards the end of the event as observed by the AIA instrument. The methods used
in this analysis hold a significant potential for early characterization of coronal shock waves
and forecasting of SEP spectra based on remote observations.
