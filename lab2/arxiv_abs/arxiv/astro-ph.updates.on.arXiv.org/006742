Gaia DR2 provides a unique all-sky catalogue of 550'737 variable stars, of which 151'761 are long-period
variable (LPV) candidates with G variability amplitudes larger than 0.2 mag (5-95% quantile range).
About one-fifth of the LPV candidates are Mira candidates, the majority of the rest are semi-regular
variable candidates. For each source, G, BP , and RP photometric time-series are published, together
with some LPV-specific attributes for the subset of 89'617 candidates with periods in G longer than
60 days. We describe this first Gaia catalogue of LPV candidates, and present various validation
checks. Various samples of LPVs were used to validate the catalogue: a sample of well-studied very
bright LPVs with light curves from the AAVSO that are partly contemporaneous with Gaia light curves,
a sample of Gaia LPV candidates with good parallaxes, the ASAS_SN catalogue of LPVs, and the OGLE
catalogues of LPVs towards the Magellanic Clouds and the Galactic bulge. The analyses of these samples
show a good agreement between Gaia DR2 and literature periods. The same is globally true for bolometric
corrections of M-type stars. The main contaminant of our DR2 catalogue comes from young stellar
objects (YSOs) in the solar vicinity (within ~1 kpc), although their number in the whole catalogue
is only at the percent level. A cautionary note is provided about parallax-dependent LPV attributes
published in the catalogue. This first Gaia catalogue of LPVs approximately doubles the number
of known LPVs with amplitudes larger than 0.2 mag, despite the conservative candidate selection
criteria that prioritise low contamination over high completeness, and despite the limited DR2
time coverage compared to the long periods characteristic of LPVs. It also contains a small set of
YSO candidates, which offers the serendipitous opportunity to study these objects at an early stage
of the Gaia data releases.
