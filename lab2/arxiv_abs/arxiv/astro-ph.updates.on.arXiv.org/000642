For galaxies hosting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), it has been observed that the mass of the
central black hole (M_BH) tightly correlates with the effective or central velocity dispersion
(sigma) of the host galaxy. The origin of this M_BH - sigma scaling relation is assumed to lie in the
merging history of the galaxies but many open questions about its origin and the behavior in different
mass ranges still need to be addressed. The goal of this work is to study the black-hole scaling relations
for low black-hole masses, where the regime of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in globular
clusters (GCs) is entered. We collect all existing reports of dynamical black-hole measurements
in globular clusters, providing black-hole masses or upper limits for 14 candidates. We plot the
black-hole masses versus different cluster parameters including total mass, velocity dispersion,
concentration and half-mass radius. We search for trends and test the correlations in order to quantify
their significance using a set of different statistical approaches. For correlations showing
a large significance we perform a linear fit, accounting for uncertainties and upper limits. We
find a clear correlation between the mass of the IMBH and the velocity dispersion of the globular
cluster. As expected, the total mass of the globular cluster then also correlates with the mass of
the IMBH. While the slope of the M_BH - sigma correlation differs strongly from the one observed for
SMBHs, the other scaling relations M_BH - M_TOT, and M_BH - L are similar to the correlations in galaxies.
Significant correlations of black-hole mass with other cluster properties were not found in the
present sample.
