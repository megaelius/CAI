The simultaneous detection of electromagnetic and gravitational waves from the coalescence of
two neutron stars (GW170817 and GRB170817A) has ushered in a new era of "multi-messenger" astronomy,
with electromagnetic detections spanning from gamma to radio. This great opportunity for new scientific
investigations raises the issue of how the available multi-messenger tools can best be integrated
to constitute a powerful method to study the transient universe in particular. To facilitate the
classification of possible optical counterparts to gravitational-wave events, it is important
to optimize the scheduling of observations and the filtering of transients, both key elements of
the follow-up process. In this work, we describe the existing workflow whereby telescope networks
such as GRANDMA and GROWTH are currently scheduled; we then present modifications we have developed
for the scheduling process specifically, so as to face the relevant challenges that have appeared
during the latest observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. We address issues with scheduling
more than one epoch for multiple fields within a skymap, especially for large and disjointed localizations.
This is done in two ways: by optimizing the maximum number of fields that can be scheduled, and by splitting
up the lobes within the skymap by right ascension to be scheduled individually. In addition, we implement
the ability to take previously observed fields into consideration when rescheduling. We show the
improvements that these modifications produce in making the search for optical counterparts more
efficient, and we point to areas needing further improvement.
