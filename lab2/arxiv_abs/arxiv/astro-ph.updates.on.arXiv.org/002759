We present a sample of 266 bright (-22.7 < M_UV < -20.5) Lyman-break galaxies at 5.5 < z <
6.5 found within a total of 1.65 square degrees of imaging in the UltraVISTA/COSMOS and UKIDSS UDS/SXDS
fields. The deep near-infrared imaging available in the two independent fields, in addition to
deep optical (including z'-band) data, enables the sample of z ~ 6 star-forming galaxies to be securely
detected long-ward of the break (in contrast to several previous studies). By simulating the potential
contamination of our sample by cool galactic brown dwarfs, we find that the expected contamination
rate of our initial sample is < 3 percent and that dwarf stars can be effectively removed by fitting
dwarf star spectral templates to the photometry. At z ~ 6 the galaxy surface density in the UltraVISTA
field exceeds that in the UDS by a factor of ~ 1.8, indicating strong cosmic variance even between
degree-scale fields at z > 5. We calculate the bright end of the rest-frame Ultra-Violet (UV)
luminosity function (LF) at z ~ 6. The galaxy number counts are a factor of 2 lower than predicted by
the recent LF determination by Bouwens et al.. In comparison to other smaller area studies, we find
an evolution in the characteristic magnitude between z ~ 5 and z ~ 7 of dM* ~ 0.4 mag, and show that a double
power-law or a Schechter function can equally well describe the LF at z = 6. Furthermore, the bright-end
of the LF appears to steepen from z ~ 7 to z ~ 5, which could indicate the onset of mass quenching or the
rise of dust obscuration, a conclusion supported by comparing the observed LFs to a range of theoretical
model predictions.
