We use the LAMOST spectra of member stars in Pleiades, M34, Praesepe, and Hyades to study how chromospheric
activity vary as a function of mass and rotation at different age. We measured excess equivalent
widths of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and Ca~{\sc ii} K based on estimated chromospheric contributions
from old and inactive field dwarfs, and excess luminosities are obtained by normalizing bolometric
luminosity, for more than 700 late-type stars in these open clusters. Results indicate two activity
sequences in cool spot coverage and H$\alpha$ excess emission among GK dwarfs in Pleiades and M dwarfs
in Praesepe and Hyades, paralleling with well known rotation sequences. A weak dependence of chromospheric
emission on rotation exists among ultra fast rotators in saturated regime with Rossby number Ro$\lesssim0.1$.
In the unsaturated regime, chromospheric and coronal emission show similar dependence on Ro, but
with a shift toward larger Ro, indicating chromospheric emission gets easily saturated than coronal
emission, and/or convective turnover time-scales based on X-ray data do not work well with chromospheric
emission. More interestingly, our analysis show fully convective slow rotators obey the rotation-chromospheric
activity relation similar to hotter stars, confirming the previous finding. We found correlations
among H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and Ca~{\sc ii} K emissions, in which H$\alpha$ losses are more important
than Ca~{\sc ii} K for cooler and more active stars. In addition, a weak correlation is seen between
chromospheric emission and photospheric activity that shows dependency on stellar spectral type
and activity level, which provides some clues on how spot configuration vary as a function of mass
and activity level.
