We present new low-resolution (R~800) optical spectra of 22 Galactic PNe with Spitzer spectra.
These data are combined with recent optical spectroscopic data available in the literature to construct
representative samples of compact (and presumably young) Galactic disc and bulge PNe with Spitzer
spectra. Attending to the nature of the dust features seen in their Spitzer spectra, Galactic disc
and bulge PNe are classified according to four major dust types (oxygen chemistry or OC, carbon chemistry
or CC, double chemistry or DC, featureless or F) and subtypes (amorphous and crystalline, and aliphatic
and aromatic). Nebular gas abundances of He, N, O, Ne, S, Cl and Ar, as well as plasma parameters (e.g.
Ne, Te) are homogeneously derived and we study the median chemical abundances and nebular properties
in Galactic disc and bulge PNe depending on their Spitzer dust types and subtypes. A comparison of
the derived median abundance patterns with AGB nucleosynthesis predictions show mainly that:
i) DC PNe, both with amorphous and crystalline silicates, display high-metallicity (solar/supra-solar)
and the highest He abundances and N/O ratios, suggesting relatively massive (~3-5 M_sun) hot bottom
burning AGB stars as progenitors; ii) PNe with O-rich and C-rich unevolved dust (amorphous and aliphatic)
seem to evolve from sub-solar metallicity (z~0.008) and lower mass (<3 M_sun) AGB stars; iii)
a few O-rich PNe and a significant fraction of C-rich PNe with more evolved dust (crystalline and
aromatic, respectively) display chemical abundances similar to DC PNe, suggesting that they are
related objects. A comparison of the derived nebular properties with predictions from models combining
the theoretical central star evolution with a simple nebular model is also presented. Finally,
a possible link between the Spitzer dust properties, chemical abundances and evolutionary status
is discussed.
