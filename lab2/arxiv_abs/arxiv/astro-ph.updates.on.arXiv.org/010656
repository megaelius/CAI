Context. Direct imaging of debris discs gives important information about their nature, their
global morphology, and allows us to identify specific structures possibly in connection with the
presence of gravitational perturbers. It is the most straightforward technique to observe planetary
systems as a whole. Aims. We present the first resolved images of the debris disc around the young
F-type star HD 160305, detected in scattered light using the VLT/SPHERE instrument in the near infrared.
Methods. We used a post-processing method based on angular differential imaging and synthetic
images of debris discs produced with a disc modelling code (GRaTer) to constrain the main characteristics
of the disc around HD 160305. All of the point sources in the field of the IRDIS camera were analysed
with an astrometric tool to determine whether they are bound objects or background stars. Results.
We detect a very inclined (~ 82{\deg}) ring-like debris disc located at a stellocentric distance
of about 86au (deprojected width ~27 au). The disc displays a brightness asymmetry between the two
sides of the major axis, as can be expected from scattering properties of dust grains. We derive an
anisotropic scattering factor g>0.5. A second right-left asymmetry is also observed with respect
to the minor axis. We measure a surface brightness ratio of 0.73 $\pm$ 0.18 between the bright and
the faint sides. Because of the low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the images we cannot easily discriminate
between several possible explanations for this left-right asymmetry, such as perturbations by
an unseen planet, the aftermath of the breakup of a massive planetesimal, or the pericenter glow
effect due to an eccentric ring. Two epochs of observations allow us to reject the companionship
hypothesis for the 15 point sources present in the field.
