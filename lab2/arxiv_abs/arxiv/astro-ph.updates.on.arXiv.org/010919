We present a Chandra and XMM-Newton imaging and spectroscopic study of the supernova remnant (SNR)
RCW 103 (G332.4-00.4) containing the Central Compact Object 1E 161348-5055. The high resolution
Chandra X-ray images reveal enhanced emission in the south-eastern and north-western regions.
Equivalent width line images of Fe L, Mg, Si, and S using XMM-Newton data were used to map the distribution
of ejecta. The SNR was sectioned into 56 regions best characterized by two-component thermal models.
The harder component (kT~0.6 keV) is adequately fitted by the VPSHOCK non-equilibrium ionization
model with an ionization timescale ~ 1E11-1E12 cm^-3 s, and slightly enhanced abundances over solar
values. The soft component (kT~0.2 keV), fitted by the APEC model, is well described by plasma in
collisional ionization equilibrium with abundances consistent with solar values. Assuming a
distance of 3.1 kpc and a Sedov phase of expansion into a uniform medium, we estimate an SNR age of 4.4
kyr, a swept-up mass M_sw=16 f_s^{-1/2} D_{3.1}^{5/2} solar masses, and a low explosion energy
E=3.7E49 f_s^{-1/2} D_{3.1}^{5/2} erg. This energy could be an order of magnitude higher if we relax
the Sedov assumption, the plasma has a low filling factor, the plasma temperature is under-estimated,
or if the SNR is expanding into the progenitor's wind-blown bubble. Standard explosion models did
not match the ejecta yields. By comparing the fitted abundances to the most recent core-collapse
nucleosynthesis models, our best estimate yields a low-mass progenitor around 12-13 solar masses,
lower than previously reported. We discuss degeneracies in the model fitting, particularly the
effect of altering the explosion energy on the progenitor mass estimate.
