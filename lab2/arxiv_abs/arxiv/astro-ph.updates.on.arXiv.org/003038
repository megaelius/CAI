The absolute number and the density profiles of different types of stars in the solar neighborhood
are a fundamental anchor for studies of the initial mass function, stellar evolution, and galactic
structure. Using data from the Gaia DR1 Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution, we reconstruct Gaia's
selection function and we determine Gaia's volume completeness, the local number density, and
the vertical profiles of different spectral types along the main sequence from early A stars to late
K stars as well as along the giant branch. We clearly detect the expected flattening of the stellar
density profile near the mid-plane for all stellar types: All vertical profiles are well represented
by sech^2 profiles, with scale heights ranging from ~50 pc for A stars to ~150 pc for G and K dwarfs and
giants. We determine the luminosity function along the main sequence for M_V < 7 (M >~ $0.72 M_\odot$)
and along the giant branch for M_J >~ -2.5. Converting this to a mass function, we find that the high-mass
(M > $1\,M_\odot$) present-day mass function along the main sequence is d n / d M = 0.016 $(M/M_\odot)^{-4.7}$
stars/pc^3/$M_\odot$. Extrapolating below M = $0.72\,M_\odot$, we find a total mid-plane stellar
density of 0.040+/-0.002 $M_\odot$/pc^3. Giants contribute 0.00039+/-0.00001 stars/pc^3 or
about 0.00046+/-0.00005 $M_\odot$/pc^3. The star-formation rate surface density is \Sigma(t)
= 7+/-1 exp(-t/[7+/-1 Gyr]) $M_\odot$/pc^2/Gyr. Overall, we find that Gaia DR1's selection biases
are manageable and allow a detailed new inventory of the solar neighborhood to be made that agrees
with and extends previous studies. This bodes well for mapping the Milky Way with the full Gaia data
set.
