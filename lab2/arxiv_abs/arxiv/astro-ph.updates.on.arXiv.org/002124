The pulsar triple system, J0337+1715, is remarkably regular and highly hierarchical. Secular
dynamics controls its long term evolution with orbital commensurability having negligible effect.
Secular interactions transfer angular momentum between inner and outer orbits unless their apsidal
lines are parallel or anti-parallel. These choices correspond, respectively, to orthogonal eigenmodes
p and a. Each is characterized by an eccentricity ratio set by the masses and semi-major axes, i.e.,
$e_{p, 1}/e_{p, 2}\sim a_1/a_2$ while $e_{a, 1}/e_{a, 2}\sim (a_1/a_2)^{-3/2}(m_2/m_1)$. Mode
p dominates the system's current state so $e_1/e_2$ always remains close to $e_{p, 1}/e_{p, 2}$.
A small contribution by Mode a causes $e_1$ and $e_2$ to oscillate with period $\sim 10^3\,\yr$.
Orbital changes should be apparent in a few years. These will reveal the forcing of the apsidal precession
of the inner orbit by general relativity (GR), and possibly also the smaller contribution due to
the tidal and rotational distortion of the inner white dwarf (WD). Phinney (1992) proposes that
the epicyclic energy of a WD-pulsar binary reaches equipartition with the kinetic energy of a single
convective eddy when the WD's progenitor fills its Roche lobe. We extend Phinney's theory to apply
to modes rather than individual orbits. Thus we predict that Mode p and Mode a achieved equipartition
with eddies in the giant envelopes of the progenitors of the outer and inner WD, respectively. The
most effective eddies are those with lifetimes closest to the orbit period. These were more energetic
in the progenitor of the outer WD. This explains why Mode p overwhelms Mode a, and also why the inner
binary's orbit is far more eccentric than other WD-pulsar binaries with similar orbit periods.
Mode a's small but finite amplitude places a lower bound of $Q\sim 10^6$ on the tidal quality parameter
of the inner WD.
