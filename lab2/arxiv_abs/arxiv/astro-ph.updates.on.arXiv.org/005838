We report the results of a search for serendipitous [CII] 157.74$\mu$m emitters at $z\sim4.4$-$4.7$
using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The search exploits the AS2UDS
continuum survey, which covers ~50 arcmin$^2$ of the sky towards 695 luminous ($S_{870}\gtrsim1$mJy)
submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), selected from the SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey (S2CLS) 0.96deg$^2$
Ultra Deep Survey (UDS) field. We detect ten candidate line emitters, with an expected false detection
rate of ten percent. All of these line emitters correspond to 870$\mu$m continuum-detected sources
in AS2UDS. The emission lines in two emitters appear to be high-J CO, but the remainder have multi-wavelength
properties consistent with [CII] from $z\simeq4.5$ galaxies. Using our sample, we place a lower
limit of $>5\times10^{-6}$Mpc$^{-3}$ on the space density of luminous ($L_{\rm IR} \simeq 10^{13}$Lsun)
SMGs at $z=4.40$-$4.66$, suggesting $\ge7$percent of SMGs with $S_{870\mu{\rm m}}\gtrsim1$mJy
lie at $4<z<5$. From stacking the high-resolution ($\sim0.15"$ full-width half maximum) ALMA
$870\mu$m imaging, we show that the [CII] line emission is more extended than the continuum dust
emission, with an average effective radius for the [CII] of $r_{\rm e} = 1.7^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$kpc
compared to $r_{\rm e} = 1.0\pm0.1$kpc for the continuum (rest-frame $160\mu$m). By fitting the
far-infrared photometry for these galaxies from $100$-$870\mu$m, we show that SMGs at $z\sim4.5$
have a median dust temperature of $T_{\rm d}=55\pm4$K. This is systematically warmer than $870\mu$m-selected
SMGs at $z\simeq2$, which typically have temperatures around $35$K. These $z\simeq4.5$ SMGs display
a steeper trend in the luminosity-temperature plane than $z\le2$ SMGs. We discuss the implications
of this result in terms of the selection biases of high redshift starbursts in far-infrared/submillimeter
surveys.
