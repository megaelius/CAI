The first nearby very-low mass star planet-host discovered, TRAPPIST-1, presents not only a unique
opportunity for studying a system of multiple terrestrial planets, but a new means to test the nature
of magnetic processes taking place at the end of the main sequence. These encompass both the possibility
of persistent coronal solar-like activity, despite cool atmospheric temperatures, and the presence
of large-scale magnetospheric currents, similar to what is seen in the Jovian system. Significantly,
the current systems include a potential role for close-in planetary satellites analogous to the
role played by the Galilean satellites around Jupiter. We present the first radio observations
of the seven-planet TRAPPIST-1 system using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, looking for both
highly circularly polarized radio emission and/or persistent quiescent emissions. We measure
a broadband upper flux limit of <8.1 uJy across 4-8 GHz, and place these observations both in the context
of expectations for stellar radio emission, and the possible electrodynamic engines driving strong
radio emissions in very-low mass stars and brown dwarfs, with implications for future radio surveys
of TRAPPIST-1 like planet-hosts. We conclude that magnetic activity of TRAPPIST-1 is predominantly
coronal and does not behave like the strong radio emitters at the stellar/sub-stellar boundary.
We further discuss the potential importance of magnetic field topology and rotation rates, demonstrating
that a TRAPPIST-1 like planetary system around a rapidly rotating very-low mass star can generate
emission consistent with the observed radio luminosities of very-low mass stars and brown dwarfs.
