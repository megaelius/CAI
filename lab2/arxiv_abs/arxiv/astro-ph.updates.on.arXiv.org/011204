We present velocities of galactic outflows in seven star-forming galaxies at $z=$5-6 with stellar
masses of $M_* \sim10^{10.1}\ \rm{M_\odot}$. Although it is challenging to observationally determine
the outflow velocities, we overcome this challenge by using ALMA [CII]158 $\mu$m emission lines
for systemic velocities and deep Keck spectra with metal absorption lines for velocity profiles
available to date. We construct a composite Keck spectrum of the galaxies at $z=$5-6 with the [CII]-systemic
velocities, and fit outflow-line profiles to the SiII1260, CII1335, and SiIV1394,1403 absorption
lines in the composite spectrum. We measure the maximum (90%) and central outflow velocities to
be $v_\rm{max}=700^{+180}_{-110}\ \rm{km\ s^{-1}}$ and $v_\rm{out}= 400^{+100}_{-150}\ \rm{km\
s^{-1}}$ on average, respectively, showing no significant differences between the outflow velocities
derived with the low to high-ionization absorption lines. For $M_* \sim10^{10.1}\ \rm{M_\odot}$,
we find that the $v_\rm{max}$ value of our $z=$5-6 galaxies is 3.5 times higher than those of $z\sim0$
galaxies and comparable to $z\sim2$ galaxies. Estimating the halo circular velocity $v_\rm{cir}$
from the stellar masses and the abundance matching results, we investigate a $v_\rm{max}$-$v_\rm{cir}$
relation. Interestingly, $v_\rm{max}$ for galaxies with $M_*=10^{10.0-10.8}\ \rm{M_\odot}$
shows a clear positive correlation with $v_\rm{cir}$ and/or the galaxy star formation rate over
$z=$0-6 with a small scatter of $\simeq \pm 0.1$ dex, which is in good agreement with theoretical
predictions. This positive correlation suggests that the outflow velocity is physically related
to the halo circular velocity, and that the redshift evolution of $v_\rm{max}$ at fixed $M_*$ is
explained by the increase of $v_\rm{cir}$ toward high redshift.
