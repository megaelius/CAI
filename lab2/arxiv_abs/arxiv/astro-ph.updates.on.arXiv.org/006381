Neutrinos play a crucial role in the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosion mechanism. The requirement
of accurately calculating the transport of neutrinos makes simulations of the CCSN mechanism extremely
challenging and computationally expensive. Historically, this stiff challenge has been met by
making approximations to the full transport equation. In this work, we compare CCSN simulations
in one- and two-dimensions with three approximate neutrino transport schemes, each implemented
in the {\tt FLASH} simulation framework. We compare a two moment M1 scheme with an analytic closure
(M1), the Isotropic Diffusion Source Approximation (IDSA), and the Advanced Spectral Leakage
(ASL) method. We identify and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each scheme. For each
approximate transport scheme, we use identical grid setups, hydrodynamics, and gravity solvers
to investigate the transport effects on supernova shock dynamics and neutrino quantities. We find
that the transport scheme has a small effect on the evolution of protoneutron star (PNS) radius,
PNS mass, and the mass accretion rate. The neutrino luminosities, mean energies, and shock radii
have a $\sim$ 10-20\% quantitative difference but the overall qualitative trends are fairly consistent
between all three approximations. We find larger differences in the gain region properties, including
the gain region mass and the net heating rate in the gain region, as well as the strength of PNS convection
in the core. We investigate the progenitor, nuclear equation of state, and stochastic perturbation
dependence of our simulations and find similar magnitudes of impact on key quantities. We also compare
the computational expense of the various approximations.
