[Abridged] By appealing to a Quark-Nova (QN; the explosive transition of a neutron star to a quark
star) in the wake of a core-collapse Supernova explosion of a massive star, we develop a unified model
for long duration Gamma-ray Bursts (LGRBs) and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The time delay (years to
decades) between the SN and the QN and, the fragmented nature (i.e. millions of chunks) of the relativistic
QN ejecta are key to yielding a robust LGRB engine. In our model, a LGRB light-curve exhibits the interaction
of the fragmented QN ejecta with a turbulent (i.e. filamentary and magnetically saturated) SN ejecta
which is shaped by its interaction with an underlying pulsar wind nebula (PWN). The afterglow is
due to the interaction of the QN chunks, exiting the SN ejecta, with the surrounding medium. Our model
can fit BAT/XRT prompt and afterglow light-curves, simultaneously with their spectra, thus yielding
the observed properties of LGRBs (e.g. the Band function and the X-ray flares). We find that the Yonetoku
law and the Amati law are not fundamental but phenomenological. FRBs result from coherent synchrotron
emission when the QN chunks interact with non-turbulent weakly magnetized PWN-SN ejecta, where
conditions are prone to the Weibel instability. Magnetic field amplification induced by the Weibel
instability sets the bunching length for electrons and pairs to radiate coherently. The resulting
emission frequency, luminosity, duration and dispersion measure in our model are consistent with
FRB data. We find a natural unification of high-energy burst phenomena from FRBs to LGRBs including
X-ray Flashes and X-ray rich GRBs as well as Super-Luminous SNe. We find a possible connection between
Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays and FRBs and propose that a QN following a binary neutron star merger
can yield a short GRB (SGRB) with fits to BAT/XRT light-curves.
