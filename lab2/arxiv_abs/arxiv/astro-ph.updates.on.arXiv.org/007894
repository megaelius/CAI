Cosmic Dawn II (CoDa II) is a new, fully-coupled radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of cosmic
reionization and galaxy formation and their mutual impact, to redshift z < 6. With $4096^3$ particles
and cells in a 94 Mpc box, it is large enough to model global reionization and its feedback on galaxy
formation while resolving all haloes above $10^8$ M$_\odot$. Using a constrained realization
of {\Lambda}CDM constructed from galaxy survey data to reproduce the large-scale structure and
familiar objects of the present-day Local Universe, CoDa II serves to model both global and local
reionization, including its impact on the Local Group. Using the same hybrid CPU-GPU code RAMSES-CUDATON
as CoDa I in Ocvirk et al. (2016), CoDa II modified and re-calibrated the subgrid star-formation
algorithm, making reionization end earlier, at z $\gtrsim 6$, thereby better matching the observations
of intergalactic Lyman-alpha opacity from quasar spectra and electron-scattering optical depth
from cosmic microwave background fluctuations. The post-reionization UV background intensity
is somewhat high, however, making the H I fraction after overlap lower than observed, a possible
sign of missing bound-free opacity from unresolved substructure. CoDa II predicts a UV continuum
luminosity function in good agreement with observations of high-z galaxies, especially at z = 6.
The cosmic star formation rate density from M1600 < -17 galaxies is only 63% (18%) of the total in all
haloes at z = 6 (z = 10). As in CoDa I, reionization feedback suppresses star formation in haloes below
$\sim 2 \times 10^9 {\rm{M}}_\odot$ , though suppression here is less extreme, a possible consequence
of modifying the star-formation algorithm. Suppression is environment-dependent, occurring
earlier (later) in overdense (underdense) regions, in response to their local reionization times.
