Gas motions in galaxy clusters play important roles in determining the properties of the intracluster
medium (ICM) and in the constraint of cosmological parameters via X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
effect observations of galaxy clusters. The Hitomi measurements of gas motions in the core of the
Perseus Cluster have provided insights into the physics in galaxy clusters. The XARM mission, equipped
with the Resolve X-ray micro-calorimeter, will continue Hitomi's legacy by measuring ICM motions
through Doppler shifting and broadening of emission lines in a larger number of galaxy clusters,
and at larger radii. In this work, we investigate how well we can measure bulk and turbulent gas motions
in the ICM with XARM, by analyzing mock XARM simulations of galaxy clusters extracted from cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations. We assess how photon counts, spectral fitting methods, multiphase
ICM structure, deprojections, and region selection affect the measurements of gas motions. We
first show that XARM is capable of recovering the underlying spherically averaged turbulent and
bulk velocity profiles for dynamically relaxed clusters to within $\sim 50\%$ with a reasonable
amount of photon counts in the X-ray emission lines. We also find that there are considerable azimuthal
variations in the ICM velocities, where the velocities measured in a single azimuthal direction
can significantly deviate from the true value even in dynamically relaxed systems. Such variation
must be taken into account when interpreting data and developing observing strategies. We will
discuss the prospect of using the upcoming XARM mission to measure non-thermal pressure and to correct
for the hydrostatic mass bias of galaxy clusters. Our results are broadly applicable for future
X-ray missions, such as Athena and Lynx.
