On 2019 July 2 a total solar eclipse -- visible across some parts of the Southern Pacific Ocean, Chile
and Argentina -- will enable observations of the Sun's large-scale coronal structure. The structure
of the Sun's corona and their emission characteristics are determined by underlying magnetic fields
which also govern coronal heating and solar eruptive events. However, coronal magnetic field measurements
remain an outstanding challenge. Computational models of coronal magnetic fields serve an important
purpose in this context. Earlier work has demonstrated that the large-scale coronal field is governed
by slow surface flux evolution and memory build-up which allows for prediction of the coronal structure
on solar rotational timescales. Utilizing this idea and based upon a 51 day forward run of a data-driven
solar surface flux transport model and a Potential Field Source Surface model, we predict the Sun's
coronal structure for the 2019 July 2 solar eclipse. We also forward model the polarization characteristics
of the coronal emission from the predicted magnetic fields. We predict two large-scale streamer
structures and their locations on the east and west limbs of the Sun and discuss the possibility of
development of a pseudo-streamer based on an analysis of field line topology. This study is relevant
for coronal magnetometry initiatives from ground-based facilities such as the Daniel K. Inouye
Solar Telescope and Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter, and upcoming space-based instruments
such as the Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope and the Variable Emission Line Coronagraph onboard
ISRO's Aditya-L1 space mission.
