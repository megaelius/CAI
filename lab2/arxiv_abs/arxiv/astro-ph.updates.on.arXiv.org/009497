The small ($\le$ 135 km mean radius) saturnian satellites are closely related to the rings and together
they constitute a complex dynamical system where formation and destruction mechanisms compete
against each other. We model the cratering process by Centaur objects on the small saturnian satellites,
and compare our results with the observational crater counts obtained from the Voyager and Cassini
missions. Using a theoretical model previously developed we calculate the crater production on
these satellites considering two slopes of the size-frequency distribution (SFD) for the smaller
objects of the Centaur population and compare our results with the available observations. In addition,
we consider the case of catastrophic collisions between these satellites and Centaur objects and
calculate the age of formation of those satellites that suffer one or more disruptions. In general
we find that the observed crater distributions are best modeled by the crater size distribution
corresponding to the $s_2 = 3.5$ index of the SFD of impactors with diameters smaller than 60 km. However,
for crater diameters $D \lesssim 3-8$ km (which correspond to impactor diameters $d \sim 0.04 - 0.15$
km), the observed distributions become flatter and deviate from our results, which may evidence
processes of erosion and/or crater saturation at small crater sizes or a possible break in the SFD
of impactors at $d \sim 0.04 - 0.15$ km to a much shallower differential slope of $\sim -1.5$. Our results
suggest that Pan, Daphnis, Atlas, Aegaeon, Methone, Anthe, Pallene, Calypso and Polydeuces suffered
one or more catastrophic collisions over the age of the Solar System, the younger being associated
to arcs with ages of $\sim10^8$ years. We have also calculated the satellites' surface ages, which
indicate ongoing resurfacing processes.
