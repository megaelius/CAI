We compare the observed turbulent pressure in molecular gas, $P_\mathrm{turb}$, to the required
pressure for the interstellar gas to stay in equilibrium in the gravitational potential of a galaxy,
$P_\mathrm{DE}$. To do this, we combine arcsecond resolution CO data from PHANGS-ALMA with multi-wavelength
data that traces the atomic gas, stellar structure, and star formation rate (SFR) for 28 nearby star-forming
galaxies. We find that $P_\mathrm{turb}$ correlates with, but almost always exceeds the estimated
$P_\mathrm{DE}$ on kiloparsec scales. This indicates that the molecular gas is over-pressurized
relative to the large-scale environment. We show that this over-pressurization can be explained
by the clumpy nature of molecular gas; a revised estimate of $P_\mathrm{DE}$ on cloud scales, which
accounts for molecular gas self-gravity, external gravity, and ambient pressure, agrees well
with the observed $P_\mathrm{turb}$ in galaxy disks. We also find that molecular gas with cloud-scale
${P_\mathrm{turb}}\approx{P_\mathrm{DE}}\gtrsim{10^5\,k_\mathrm{B}\,\mathrm{K\,cm^{-3}}}$
in our sample is more likely to be self-gravitating, whereas gas at lower pressure appears more influenced
by ambient pressure and/or external gravity. Furthermore, we show that the ratio between $P_\mathrm{turb}$
and the observed SFR surface density, $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$, is compatible with stellar feedback-driven
momentum injection in most cases, while a subset of the regions may show evidence of turbulence driven
by additional sources. The correlation between $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ and kpc-scale $P_\mathrm{DE}$
in galaxy disks is consistent with the expectation from self-regulated star formation models.
Finally, we confirm the empirical correlation between molecular-to-atomic gas ratio and kpc-scale
$P_\mathrm{DE}$ reported in previous works.
