We quantify the gas-phase abundance of deuterium and fractional contribution of stellar mass loss
to the gas in cosmological zoom-in simulations from the Feedback In Realistic Environments project.
At low metallicity, our simulations confirm that the deuterium abundance is very close to the primordial
value. The chemical evolution of the deuterium abundance that we derive here agrees quantitatively
with analytical chemical evolution models. We furthermore find that the relation between the deuterium
and oxygen abundance exhibits very little scatter. We compare our simulations to existing high-redshift
observations in order to determine a primordial deuterium fraction of 2.549 +/- 0.033 x 10^-5 and
stress that future observations at higher metallicity can also be used to constrain this value.
At fixed metallicity, the deuterium fraction decreases slightly with decreasing redshift, due
to the increased importance of mass loss from intermediate-mass stars. We find that the evolution
of the average deuterium fraction in a galaxy correlates with its star formation history. Our simulations
are consistent with observations of the Milky Way's interstellar medium: the deuterium fraction
at the solar circle is 85-92 per cent of the primordial deuterium fraction. We use our simulations
to make predictions for future observations. In particular, the deuterium abundance is lower at
smaller galactocentric radii and in higher mass galaxies, showing that stellar mass loss is more
important for fuelling star formation in these regimes (and can even dominate). Gas accreting onto
galaxies has a deuterium fraction above that of the galaxies' interstellar medium, but below the
primordial fraction, because it is a mix of gas accreting from the intergalactic medium and gas previously
ejected or stripped from galaxies.
