In current models used to interpret exoplanet atmospheric observations, the planet mass is treated
as a prior and is estimated independently with external methods, such as RV or TTV techniques. This
approach is necessary as available spectroscopic data do not have sufficient wavelength coverage
and/or SNR to infer the planetary mass. We examine here the impact of mass uncertainties on spectral
retrieval analyses for a host of atmospheric scenarios. Our approach is both analytical and numerical:
we first use simple approximations to extract analytically the influence of each parameter to the
wavelength-dependent transit depth. We then adopt a fully Bayesian retrieval model to quantify
the propagation of the mass uncertainty onto other atmospheric parameters. We found that for clear-sky,
gaseous atmospheres the posterior distributions are the same when the mass is known or retrieved.
The retrieved mass is very accurate, with a precision of more than 10%, provided the wavelength coverage
and S/N are adequate. When opaque clouds are included in the simulations, the uncertainties in the
retrieved mass increase, especially for high altitude clouds. However atmospheric parameters
such as the temperature and trace-gas abundances are unaffected by the knowledge of the mass. Secondary
atmospheres are more challenging due to the higher degree of freedom for the atmospheric main component,
which is unknown. For broad wavelength range and adequate SNR, the mass can still be retrieved accurately
and precisely if clouds are not present, and so are all the other atmospheric/planetary parameters.
When clouds are added, we find that the mass uncertainties may impact substantially the retrieval
of the mean molecular weight: an independent characterisation of the mass would therefore be helpful
to capture/confirm the main atmospheric constituent.
