The Near-infrared Sky Brightness Monitor (NIRBM) aims to measure the middle infrared sky background
in Antarctica. The NIRBM mainly consists of an InGaAs detector, a chopper, a reflector, a cooler
and a black body. The reflector can rotate to scan the sky with a field of view ranging from 0{\deg}
to 180{\deg}. Electromechanical control and weak signal readout functions are accomplished by
the same circuit, whose core chip is a STM32F407VG microcontroller. Considering the environment
is harsh for humans in Antarctica, a multi-level remote control software system is designed and
implemented. A set of EPICS IOCs are developed to control each hardware module independently via
serial port communication with the STM32 microcontroller. The tornado web framework and PyEpics
are introduced as a combination where PyEpics is used to monitor or change the EPICS Process Variables,
functioning as a client for the EPICS framework. Tornado is responsible for the specific operation
process of inter-device collaboration, and expose a set of interfaces to users to make calls. Considering
the high delay and low bandwidth of the network environment, the tornado back-end is designed as
a master-and-agent architecture to improve domestic user experience. The master node is deployed
in Antarctic while multiple agent nodes can be deployed domestic. The master and agent nodes communicate
with each other through the WebSocket protocol to exchange latest information so that bandwidth
is saved. The GUI is implemented in the form of single-page application based on the Vue framework
which communicates with tornado through WebSocket and AJAX requests. The web page integrates device
control, data curve drawing, alarm display, auto observation and other functions together.
