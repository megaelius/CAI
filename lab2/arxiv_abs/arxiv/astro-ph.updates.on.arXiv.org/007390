We constrain spatially-flat tilted and nonflat untilted scalar field ($\phi$) dynamical dark
energy inflation ($\phi$CDM) models by using Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy
measurements and recent baryonic acoustic oscillation distance observations, Type Ia supernovae
apparent magnitude data, Hubble parameter measurements, and growth rate data. We assume an inverse
power-law scalar field potential energy density $V(\phi)=V_0 \phi^{-\alpha}$. We find that the
combination of the CMB data with the four non-CMB data sets significantly improves parameter constraints
and strengthens the evidence for nonflatness in the nonflat untilted $\phi$CDM case from $1.8\sigma$
for the CMB measurements only to more than $3.1\sigma$ for the combined data. In the nonflat untilted
$\phi$CDM model current observations favor a spatially closed universe with spatial curvature
contributing about two-thirds of a percent of the present cosmological energy budget. The flat
tilted $\phi$CDM model is a 0.4$\sigma$ better fit to the data than is the standard flat tilted $\Lambda$CDM
model: current data allow for the possibility that dark energy is dynamical. The nonflat tilted
$\phi$CDM model is in better accord with the Dark Energy Survey bounds on the rms amplitude of mass
fluctuations now ($\sigma_8$) as a function of the nonrelativistic matter density parameter now
($\Omega_m$) but it does not provide as good a fit to the larger-multipole Planck 2015 CMB anisotropy
data as does the standard flat tilted $\Lambda$CDM model. A few cosmological parameter value measurements
differ significantly when determined using the tilted flat and the untilted nonflat $\phi$CDM
models, including the cold dark matter density parameter and the reionization optical depth.
