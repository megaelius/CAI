The distribution of solar system absolute magnitudes ($H$) for the near-Earth asteroids (NEAs)
observable near opposition -- i.e. Amors, Apollos, and Atens ($A^3$) -- is derived from the set of
ALL currently known NEAs. The result is based only on common sense assumptions of uniformly random
distributions and that the orbital phase space and $H$-magnitude distribution of known NEAs is
representative of the total population. There is no population or other modeling and no assumption
on albedo except in interpreting the result as a size-frequency distribution (SFD). The analysis
is based on the 18355 $A^3$ NEAs cataloged by the MPC as of June 2018. The observations from 9 of the
top programs (in terms of number of distinct NEAs observed) and the smaller but deeper DECam NEO Survey
are used, comprising 74696 measurements of 13466 NEAs observed within 30 deg of opposition. The
only parameter in the analysis is an estimate of the detection magnitude limits for each program.
A single power-law slope for the cumulative distribution, $\log(N<H)=0.50\pm0.03H$, for $H <
27$ is found with no evidence for additional structure. A turn-over fainter than 27th magnitude
may occur, but the population of known NEAs is dropping off rapidly because they are difficult to
detect and so possibly is a completeness effect. Connecting to the nearly complete census of the
brightest/biggest NEAs (diameter $> {\sim}2$Km) provides a normalization that estimates ${\sim}10^8
A^3$ NEAs with $H < {\sim}27$ corresponding to NEAs greater than ${\sim}10$m in diameter for reasonable
typical albedos. Restricting the analysis to Earth crossing asteroids (10839 known, 7336 selected,
36541 observed) produces the same power-law slope.
