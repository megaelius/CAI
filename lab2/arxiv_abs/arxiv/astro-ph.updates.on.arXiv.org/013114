We report results of astrometric VLBI observations toward a Mira variable star BX~Cam using the
VLBI array "VERA". The observations were performed from February 2012 to November 2014. Obtained
parallax is 1.73$\pm$0.03 mas corresponding to a distance of 0.58$\pm$0.01 kpc. Parallax of this
source was also reported in Gaia DR2 as 4.13$\pm$0.25 mas, and there is a 240 \% difference between
these two measurements. Astrometric results from our VLBI observations show that we exactly traced
angular motions of the seven maser spots in BX~Cam. We calculated stellar luminosities using both
parallaxes, and obtained luminosities of $L_{\ast}^{\mathrm{VERA}} = 4950\pm170 L_{\odot}$
and $L_{\ast}^{\mathrm{Gaia}} = 870\pm110 L_{\odot}$. Deduced luminosities also support a validity
of the parallax that we determined with VERA. Evaluating the two parallaxes, we concluded that the
parallax of 1.73$\pm$0.03 mas from the VERA observations is correct for BX~Cam. We obtained a systemic
motion of BX~Cam as (${\mu_{\alpha}}\cos{\delta}^{\mathrm{sys}}$, ${\mu}_{\delta}^{\mathrm{sys}}$)
$=$ (13.48$\pm$0.14, $-$34.30$\pm$0.18) mas\,yr$^{-1}$. A total of 73 H$_2$O maser spots detected
from our VLBI observations show a spatial distribution of 30 au $\times$ 80 au with a strong elongation
along north-south direction. They show outflows with a three-dimensional velocity of 14.79$\pm$1.40
km\,s$^{-1}$. From a comparison between time variations of $V$-band magnitudes and H$_2$O maser,
we found that variation of the H$_2$O maser is relevant to that seen in $V$-band even though the H$_2$O
maser does not recover its maximum flux in each cycle.
