Local magnetic reversals are an inseparable part of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence whose
collective outcome on an arbitrary scale in the inertial range may lead to a global stochastic reconnection
event with a rate independent of small scale physics. We show that this picture is intimately related
to the nanoflare theory of the solar corona. First, we argue that due to stochastic flux freezing,
a generalized version of flux freezing in turbulence, the magnetic field follows the turbulent
flow in a statistical sense. Bending and stretching an initially smooth field, therefore, the turbulence
generally increases the magnetic spatial complexity. Strong magnetic shears associated with
such a highly tangled field can trigger local reversals and field annihilations that convert magnetic
energy into kinetic and thermal energy respectively. The former maintains the turbulence, which
incidentally continues to entangle the field completing the cycle, while the latter enhances the
heat generation in the dissipative range. We support this theoretical picture invoking recent
analytical and numerical studies which suggest a correlation between magnetic complexity and
magnetic energy dissipation. The amplification of multiple local, in-phase reversals by super-linear
Richardson diffusion may initiate a global reconnection at larger scales, however, even in the
absence of such a global stochastic reconnection, the small scale reversals will continue to interact
with the turbulence. We employ conventional scaling laws of MHD turbulence to illustrate that these
local events are indeed efficient in both enhancing the turbulence and generating heat. Finally,
using an MHD numerical simulation, we show that the time evolution of the magnetic complexity is
statistically correlated with the kinetic energy injection rate and/or magnetic-to-thermal
energy conversion rate.
