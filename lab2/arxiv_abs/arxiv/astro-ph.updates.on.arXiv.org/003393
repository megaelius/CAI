Within the GAs Stripping Phenomena in galaxies with MUSE (GASP) sample, we identified an ongoing
merger between two galaxies in a poor group at $z = 0.05043$. We present the spatially resolved kinematics
and physical properties of gas and stars of this object and describe its evolutionary history. An
old (luminosity weighted age $\rm \sim 2\times 10^9 \, yr$), gas poor, early-type-like galaxy is
merging with a younger (luminosity weighted age $\rm \sim 2.5\times 10^8 \, yr$), gas rich, late-type
galaxy. The system has a quite strong metallicity gradient, indicative of an early-stage phase.
Comparing the spatial extension of the star formation at different epochs, we can date the beginning
of the merging between $\rm 2\times 10^7 yr <t<5.7\times 10^8 yr$ ago. The gas kinematic pattern
reflects the gas of the late-type object and is distorted mainly in correspondence to the location
of the impact, while the northern regions had not time to be noticeably influenced yet. The stellar
kinematic instead is much more chaotic, as expected in case of mergers. The gas redistribution in
the system induces high levels of star formation between the two components, especially in the region
of the impact, where we detect the formation of a tidal dwarf galaxy. This stellar structure has a
mass of $\sim 6\times 10^9 M_\odot$ and a radius of $\rm \sim 2 \, kpc$ and, even though it has already
accreted large quantities of gas and stars, it is still located within the disk of the progenitor,
is characterized by a high velocity dispersion, indication that it is still forming, is dusty and
has high levels of star formation (SFR$\sim 0.3 M_\odot \, yr^{-1}$). This tidal dwarf is originated
in an early-stage merger, while these stellar structures usually form in more evolved systems.
