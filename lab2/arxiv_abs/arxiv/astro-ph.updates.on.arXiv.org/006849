Context. Recent observations of unexpected structures in the Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) spectrum
and composition, as well as growing evidence for episodes of intense dynamical activity in the inner
regions of the Galaxy, call for an evaluation of the high-energy particle acceleration associated
with such activity and its potential impact on the global GCR phenomenology. Aims. We investigate
whether particles accelerated during high-power episodes around the Galactic center can account
for a significant fraction of the observed GCRs, or conversely what constraints can be derived regarding
their Galactic transport if their contributions are negligible. Methods. We address these questions
by studying the contribution of a continuous source of energetic particles at the Galactic center
to the local GCRs. Particle transport in the Galaxy is described with a two-zone analytical model.
We solve for the contribution of a Galactic Center Cosmic-Ray (GCCR) source using Green functions
and Bessel expansion, and discuss the required injection power for these GCCRs to influence the
global GCR phenomenology at Earth. Results. We find that, with standard parameters for particle
propagation in the galactic disk and halo, the GCCRs can make a significant or even dominant contribution
to the total CR flux observed at Earth. Depending on the parameters, such a source can account for
both the observed proton flux and B-to-C ratio (in the case of a Kraichnan-like scaling of the diffusion
coefficient), or potentially produce spectral and composition features. Conclusions. Our results
show that the contribution of GCCRs cannot be neglected a priori, and that they can influence the
global GCR phenomenology significantly, thereby calling for a reassessement of the standard inferences
from a scenario where GCRs are entirely dominated by a single type of sources distributed throughout
the Galactic disk.
