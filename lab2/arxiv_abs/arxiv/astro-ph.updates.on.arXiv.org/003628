Whether is ground-based or space-based, any optical instrument suffers from some amount of optical
geometric distortion. Recently, the diffraction-limited image quality afforded by space-based
telescopes and by Adaptive Optics (AO) corrected instruments on ground based-telescope, have
increased the relative importance of the error terms induced by optical distortions. In particular,
variable distortions present in Multi-Conjugated Adaptive Optics (MCAO) data are limiting the
astrometry and photometry accuracy of such high resolution instruments. From there, the ability
to deal with those phenomenon had become a critical issue for high-precision studies. We present
in this paper an optimal method of distortion correction for high angular resolution images. Based
on a prior-knowledge of the static distortion the method aims to correct the dynamical distortions
specifically for each observation set and each frame. The method follows an inverse problem approach
based on the work done by Gratadour et al. 2005 on image re-centering, and we aim to generalized it
to any kind of distortion mode. The complete formalism of a Weighted Least Square minimization,
as well as a detailed characterization of the error budget are presented. In particular we study
the influence of different parameters such as the number of frames and the density of the field (sparse
or crowed images), of the noise level, and of the aliasing effect. Finally, we show the first application
of the method on real observations collected with the Gemini MCAO instrument, GeMS/GSAOI. The performance
as well as the gain brought by this method are presented.
