The faintest Local Group galaxies found lurking in and around the Milky Way halo provide a unique
test bed for theories of structure formation and evolution on small scales. Deep Subaru and Hubble
Space Telescope photometry demonstrates that their stellar populations are old, and that the star
formation activity did not last longer than 2 Gyr in these systems. A few mechanisms that may lead
to such a rapid quenching have been investigated by means of hydrodynamic simulations, without
providing any final assessment so far. This is the first in a series of papers aimed at analysing the
roles of stellar feedback, ram pressure stripping, host-satellite tidal interactions and reionization
in cleaning the lowest-mass Milky Way companions of their cold gas, by using high-resolution, three-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations. We simulate an isolated ultrafaint dwarf galaxy loosely modeled after
Bootes I, and examine whether or not stellar feedback alone could drive a substantial fraction of
the ambient gas out from the shallow potential well. In contrast to simple analytical estimates,
but in agreement with previous hydrodynamical studies, we find that most of the cold gas reservoir
is retained. Conversely, a significant fraction of the metal-enriched stellar ejecta crosses
the boundaries of the computational box with velocities exceeding the local escape velocity and
is, thus, likely lost from the system. Although the total energy output from multiple supernova
explosions exceeds the binding energy of the gas, no galactic-scale outflow develops in our simulations
and as such, most of the ambient medium remains trapped within the weak potential well of the model
galaxy. It seems thus unavoidable that, in order to explain the dearth of gas in ultrafaint dwarf
galaxies, we will have to resort to environmental effects. This will be the subject of a forthcoming
paper.
