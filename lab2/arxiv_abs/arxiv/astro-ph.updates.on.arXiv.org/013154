Extending our recent studies of two-dimensional stellar convection to 3D, we compare three-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations to identically set-up two-dimensional simulations, for a realistic
pre-main sequence star. We compare statistical quantities related to convective flows including:
average velocity, vorticity, local enstrophy, and penetration depth beneath a convection zone.
These statistics are produced during stationary, steady-state compressible convection in the
star's convection zone. Our simulations with the MUSIC code confirm the common result that two-dimensional
simulations of stellar convection have a higher magnitude of velocity on average than three-dimensional
simulations. Boundary conditions and the extent of the spherical shell can affect the magnitude
and variability of convective velocities. The difference between 2D and 3D velocities is dependent
on these background points; in our simulations this can have an effect as large as the difference
resulting from the dimensionality of the simulation. Nevertheless, radial velocities near the
convective boundary are comparable in our 2D and 3D simulations. The average local enstrophy of
the flow is lower for two-dimensional simulations than for three-dimensional simulations, indicating
a different shape and structuring of 3D stellar convection. We perform a statistical analysis of
the depth of convective penetration below the convection zone, using the model proposed in our recent
study (Pratt et al. 2017). Here we analyze the convective penetration in three dimensional simulations,
and compare the results to identically set-up 2D simulations. In 3D the penetration depth is as large
as the penetration depth calculated from 2D simulations.
