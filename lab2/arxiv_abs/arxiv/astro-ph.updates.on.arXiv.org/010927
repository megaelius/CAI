We present a statistical weak-lensing magnification analysis on an optically selected sample
of 3029 \texttt{CAMIRA} galaxy clusters with richness $N>15$ in the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC)
survey. The CAMIRA sample spans a wide redshift range of $0.2\leq z <1.1$. We use two distinct populations
of color-selected, flux-limited background galaxies, namely the low-$z$ and high-$z$ samples
at mean redshifts of $\approx1.1$ and $\approx1.4$, respectively, from which to measure the weak-lensing
magnification signal by accounting for cluster contamination as well as masking effects. Our magnification
bias measurements are found to be uncontaminated according to validation tests against the "null-test"
samples for which the net magnification bias is expected to vanish. The magnification bias for the
full \texttt{CAMIRA} sample is detected at a significance level of $8.29\sigma$, which is dominated
by the high-$z$ background. We forward-model the observed magnification data to constrain the
richness-to-mass ($N-M$) relation for the \texttt{CAMIRA} sample. In this work, we can only constrain
the normalization of the $N-M$ relation by employing informative priors on the mass and redshift
trends, and on the intrinsic scatter at fixed mass. The resulting scaling relation is $N\propto
{M_{500}}^{0.91\pm0.14} (1 + z)^{-0.45\pm0.75}$, with a characteristic richness of $N=\left(19.63\pm3.16\right)$
and intrinsic log-normal scatter of $0.14\pm0.07$ at $M_{500} = 10^{14}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$. With
the derived $N-M$ relation, we provide magnification-calibrated mass estimates of individual
\texttt{CAMIRA} clusters, with the typical uncertainty of $\approx38\percent$ and $\approx30\percent$
at richness$\approx20$ and $\approx40$, respectively. We further compare our magnification-inferred
$N-M$ relation with those from the shear-based results in the literature, finding good agreement.
