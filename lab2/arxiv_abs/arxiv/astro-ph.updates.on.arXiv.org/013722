Correlated noise affects most astronomical datasets and to neglect accounting for it can lead to
spurious signal detections, especially in low signal-to-noise conditions, which is often the
context in which new discoveries are pursued. For instance, in the realm of exoplanet detection
with radial velocity time series, stellar variability can induce false detections. However, a
white noise approximation is often used because accounting for correlated noise when analyzing
data implies a more complex analysis. Moreover, the computational cost can be prohibitive as it
typically scales as the cube of the dataset size. For some restricted classes of correlated noise
models, there are specific algorithms that can be used to help bring down the computational cost.
This improvement in speed is particularly useful in the context of Gaussian process regression,
however, it comes at the expense of the generality of the noise model. Here, we present the S+LEAF
noise model, which allows us to account for a large class of correlated noises with a linear scaling
of the computational cost with respect to the size of the dataset. The S+LEAF model includes, in particular,
mixtures of quasiperiodic kernels and calibration noise. This efficient modeling is made possible
by a sparse representation of the covariance matrix of the noise and the use of dedicated algorithms
for matrix inversion, solving, determinant computation, etc. We applied the S+LEAF model to reanalyze
the HARPS radial velocity time series of HD 136352. We illustrate the flexibility of the S+LEAF model
in handling various sources of noise. We demonstrate the importance of taking correlated noise
into account, and especially calibration noise, to correctly assess the significance of detected
signals. We provide an open-source implementation of the S+LEAF model, available at https://gitlab.unige.ch/jean-baptiste.delisle/spleaf.
