We review and discuss theoretical studies addressing the possibility of gas accretion onto black
holes occurring at rates exceeding the Eddington limit. Our focus is on the applications to the growth
of black hole seeds at high redshift. We first present the general notion of Super-Eddington accretion,
and then summarize the different models and numerical simulations developed to study such regime.
We consider optically thick flows in accretion disks as well as in spherically symmetric envelopes,
and devote particular attention to the widely adopted model based on the SLIM disk solution. While
attractive for its simplicity, the SLIM disk solution is challenged by the latest generation of
three-dimensional radiation (magneto)-hydrodynamical simulations, in which radiative losses
can be an order of magnitude higher, and the mechanisms of radiation transport is more complex than
straight advection as it takes place in a complex turbulent regime. We then discuss the gas supply
rate to the sub-pc scale accretion disk or envelope from larger scales, revisiting gas inflow rates
in protogalaxies under various conditions. We conclude that in the dense gaseous nuclei of high-z
galaxies the conditions necessary for the onset of Super Eddington accretion regimes, such as a
high optical depth and high gas supply rates from large scales, should be naturally met. Feedback
from the growing BH seed should not alter significantly such conditions according to the results
of radiation magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of super-critical flows in accretion disks.
Furthermore, based on the required nuclear gas inflow rates and the tendency of stellar feedback
to remove efficiently gas in low mass halos, we argue that super-critical accretion will be more
easily achieved in relatively sizable halos, with virial masses $M_{\rm vir} > 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$,
which become more common at $z < 15$.
