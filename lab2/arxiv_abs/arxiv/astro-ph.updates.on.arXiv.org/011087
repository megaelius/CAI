We present a weak-lensing analysis of X-ray galaxy groups and clusters selected from the XMM-XXL
survey using the first-year data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program. Our
joint weak-lensing and X-ray analysis focuses on 136 spectroscopically confirmed X-ray-selected
systems at 0.031 < z < 1.033 detected in the 25sqdeg XXL-N region. We characterize the mass distributions
of individual XXL clusters and establish their concentration-mass (c-M) relation down to group
scales, by accounting for selection bias and statistical effects, and marginalizing over the remaining
mass calibration uncertainty. We find the mass-trend parameter of the c-M relation to be \beta =
-0.07 \pm 0.28 and the normalization to be c200 = 4.8 \pm 1.0 (stat) \pm 0.8 (syst) at M200=10^{14}Msun/h
and z = 0.3. We find no statistical evidence for redshift evolution. Our weak-lensing results are
in excellent agreement with dark-matter-only c-M relations calibrated for recent LCDM cosmologies.
The level of intrinsic scatter in c200 is constrained as \sigma(\ln[c200]) < 24% (99.7% CL), which
is smaller than predicted for the full population of LCDM halos. This is likely caused by the X-ray
selection bias in terms of the relaxation state. We determine the temperature-mass (Tx-M500) relation
for a subset of 105 XXL clusters that have both measured HSC lensing masses and X-ray temperatures.
The resulting Tx-M500 relation is consistent with the self-similar prediction. Our Tx-M500 relation
agrees with the XXL DR1 results at group scales, but has a slightly steeper mass trend, implying a
smaller mass scale in the cluster regime. The overall offset in the Tx-M500 relation is at the 1.5\sigma
level, corresponding to a mean mass offset of (34\pm 20)%. We also provide bias-corrected, weak-lensing-calibrated
M500 mass estimates of individual XXL clusters based on their measured X-ray temperatures.
