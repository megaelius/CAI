The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) will investigate the origins of cosmic acceleration
using weak gravitational lensing at near infrared wavelengths. Lensing analyses place strict
constraints on the precision of size and ellipticity measurements of the point spread function.
WFIRST will use infrared detector arrays, which must be fully characterized to inform data reduction
and calibration procedures such that unbiased cosmological results can be achieved. Hirata & Choi
2019 introduces formalism to connect the cross-correlation signal of different flat field time
samples to non-linear detector behaviors such as the brighter fatter effect (BFE) and non-linear
inter-pixel capacitance (NL-IPC), and this paper applies that framework to a WFIRST development
detector, SCA 18237. We find a residual correlation signal after accounting for classical non-linearity.
This residual correlation contains a combination of the BFE and NL-IPC; however, further tests
suggest that the BFE is the dominant mechanism. If interpreted as a pure BFE, it suggests that the
effective area of a pixel is increased by $(2.87\pm0.03)\times 10^{-7}$ (stat.) for every electron
in the 4 nearest neighbors, with a rapid $\sim r^{-5.6\pm0.2}$ fall-off of the effect for more distant
neighbors. We show that the IPC inferred from hot pixels contains the same large-scale spatial variations
as the IPC inferred from auto-correlations, albeit with an overall offset of $\sim 0.06\%$. The
NL-IPC inferred from hot pixels is too small to explain the cross-correlation measurement, further
supporting the BFE hypothesis. This work presents the first evidence for the BFE in an H4RG-10 detector,
demonstrates some of the useful insights that can be gleaned from flat field statistics, and represents
a significant step towards calibration of WFIRST data.
