LARS is an Absolute Reference Spectrograph designed for ultra-precise solar observations. The
high-resolution echelle spectrograph of the Vacuum Tower Telescope is supported by a state-of-the-art
laser frequency comb to calibrate the solar spectrum on an absolute wavelength scale. In this article,
we describe the scientific instrument and focus on the upgrades in the last two years to turn the prototype
into a turn-key system. The pursued goal was to improve the short-term and long-term stability of
the systems, and enable a user-friendly and more versatile operation of the instrument. The first
upgrade involved the modernization of the frequency comb. The Fabry-Perot cavities were adjusted
to filter to a repetition frequency of 8GHz. A technologically matured photonic crystal fiber was
implemented for spectral broadening. The second, quite recent upgrade was performed on the optics
feeding the sunlight into a single-mode fiber connected to the spectrograph. A motorized translation
stage was deployed to allow the automated selection of three different fields-of-view with diameters
of 1", 3", and 10" for the analysis of the solar spectrum. The successful upgrades allow for long-term
observations of up to several hours per day with a stable spectral accuracy of 1 m/s limited by the
spectrograph. Stable, user-friendly operation of the instrument is supported. The selection
of the pre-aligned fiber to change the field of view can now be done within seconds. LARS offers the
possibility to observe absolute wavelength positions of spectral lines and Doppler velocities
in the solar atmosphere. First results demonstrate the capabilities of the instrument for solar
science. The accurate measurement of the solar convection, p-modes, and atmospheric waves will
enhance our knowledge of the solar atmosphere and its physical conditions to improve current atmospheric
models.
