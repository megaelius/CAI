We describe a module for the Athena code that solves the gray equations of radiation hydrodynamics
(RHD), based on the first two moments of the radiative transfer equation. We use a combination of
explicit Godunov methods to advance the gas and radiation variables including the non-stiff source
terms, and a local implicit method to integrate the stiff source terms. We adopt the M1 closure relation
and include all leading source terms. We employ the reduced speed of light approximation (RSLA)
with subcycling of the radiation variables in order to reduce computational costs. Our code is dimensionally
unsplit in one, two, and three space dimensions and is parallelized using MPI. The streaming and
diffusion limits are well-described by the M1 closure model, and our implementation shows excellent
behavior for a problem with a concentrated radiation source containing both regimes simultaneously.
Our operator-split method is ideally suited for problems with a slowly varying radiation field
and dynamical gas flows, in which the effect of the RSLA is minimal. We present an analysis of the dispersion
relation of RHD linear waves highlighting the conditions of applicability for the RSLA. To demonstrate
the accuracy of our method, we utilize a suite of radiation and RHD tests covering a broad range of
regimes, including RHD waves, shocks, and equilibria, which show second-order convergence in
most cases. As an application, we investigate radiation-driven ejection of a dusty, optically
thick shell in the interstellar medium (ISM). Finally, we compare the timing of our method with other
well-known iterative schemes for the RHD equations. Our code implementation, Hyperion, is suitable
for a wide variety of astrophysical applications and will be made freely available on the Web.
