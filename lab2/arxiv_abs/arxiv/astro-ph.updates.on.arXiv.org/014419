Measuring cosmic shear in wide-field imaging surveys requires accurate knowledge of the redshift
distribution of all sources. The clustering-redshift technique exploits the angular cross-correlation
of a target galaxy sample with unknown redshifts and a reference sample with known redshifts, and
is an attractive alternative to colour-based methods of redshift calibration. We test the performance
of such clustering redshift measurements using mock catalogues that resemble the Kilo-Degree
Survey (KiDS). These mocks are created from the MICE simulation and closely mimic the properties
of the KiDS source sample and the overlapping spectroscopic reference samples. We quantify the
performance of the clustering redshifts by comparing the cross-correlation results with the true
redshift distributions in each of the five KiDS photometric redshift bins. Such a comparison to
an informative model is necessary due to the incompleteness of the reference samples at high redshifts.
Clustering mean redshifts are unbiased at $|\Delta z|<0.006$ under these conditions. The redshift
evolution of the galaxy bias can be reliably mitigated at this level of precision using auto-correlation
measurements and self-consistency relations, and will not become a dominant source of systematic
error until the arrival of Stage-IV cosmic shear surveys. Using redshift distributions from a direct
colour-based estimate instead of the true redshift distributions as a model for comparison with
the clustering redshifts increases the biases in the mean to up to $|\Delta z|\sim0.04$. This indicates
that the interpretation of clustering redshifts in real-world applications will require more
sophisticated (parameterised) models of the redshift distribution in the future. If such better
models are available, the clustering-redshift technique promises to be a highly complementary
alternative to other methods of redshift calibration.
