It is increasingly suspected that the rare R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars - hydrogen-deficient
and carbon-rich supergiant stars - are the products of mergers of CO/He white-dwarf binary systems
in the intermediate mass regime ($0.6<M_{Tot}<1.2 M_{\odot}$). Only 77 RCB stars are currently
known in our Galaxy while up to 1000 were expected. It is necessary to find more of these peculiar and
diverse stars to understand their origin and evolutionary path. We are undertaking such a dedicated
search. We plan to follow up spectroscopically 2356 targets of interest that were carefully selected
using the all sky 2MASS and WISE surveys. We have observed nearly 500 of these targets using optical
low-resolution spectrographs. These spectra were compared to synthetic spectra from a new grid
of MARCs hydrogen-deficient atmospheric models. Classical RCB stars' photospheric temperatures
range mostly from 4000 K to about 8500 K, and therefore their spectra look very different showing
the presence of carbon molecules C$_2$ and CN up to $\sim$6800 K and solely atomic absorption lines
above that. We have put in place a series of criteria to distinguish RCB stars from other AGB carbon-rich
stars. We found 45 new RCB stars, including 30 Cold ($4000<T_{eff}<6800$ K), 14 Warm ($6800<T_{eff}<8500$
K) and one hot RCB ($T_{eff}>15000$ K). Forty of these belong to the Milky Way and five are located
in the Magellanic Clouds. We also confirmed that the long lasting candidate KDM 5651 is indeed a new
Magellanic RCB star, increasing the total number of Magellanic Cloud RCB stars to 30. We have increased
by $\sim$50\% the total number of RCB stars known, now reaching 147. We also include a list of 14 strong
RCB candidates, most certainly observed during a dust obscuration phase. From the detection efficiency
and success rate so far, we estimate that there should be no more than 500 RCB stars/HdC stars in the
Milky Way.
