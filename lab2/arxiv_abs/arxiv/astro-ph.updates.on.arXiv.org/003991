We examine the quenched fraction of central and satellite galaxies as a function of galaxy stellar
mass, halo mass, and the matter density of their large scale environment. Matter densities are inferred
from our ELUCID simulation, a constrained simulation of local Universe sampled by SDSS, while halo
masses and central/satellite classification are taken from the galaxy group catalog of Yang et
al. The quenched fraction for the total population increases systematically with the three quantities.
We find that the `environmental quenching efficiency', which quantifies the quenched fraction
as function of halo mass, is independent of stellar mass. And this independence is the origin of the
stellar mass-independence of density-based quenching efficiency, found in previous studies.
Considering centrals and satellites separately, we find that the two populations follow similar
correlations of quenching efficiency with halo mass and stellar mass, suggesting that they have
experienced similar quenching processes in their host halo. We demonstrate that satellite quenching
alone cannot account for the environmental quenching efficiency of the total galaxy population
and the difference between the two populations found previously mainly arises from the fact that
centrals and satellites of the same stellar mass reside, on average, in halos of different mass.
After removing these halo-mass and stellar-mass effects, there remains a weak, but significant,
residual dependence on environmental density, which is eliminated when halo assembly bias is taken
into account. Our results therefore indicate that halo mass is the prime environmental parameter
that regulates the quenching of both centrals and satellites.
