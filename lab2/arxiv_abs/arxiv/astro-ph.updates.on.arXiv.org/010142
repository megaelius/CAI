Since the first observations of solar oscillations, helioseismology has been one of the most successful
fields of astrophysics. Data of high quality were obtained through the implementation of networks
of ground-based observatories such as the GONG project or the BiSON network, coupled with space-based
telescopes such as SOHO and SDO missions. Besides the improvement of observational data, solar
seismologists developed sophisticated techniques to infer the internal structure of the Sun.
These methods, then already extensively used in the field of Geophysics, are called inversion techniques.
They allowed to determine the position of the solar convective envelope, its helium abundance and
the internal radial profiles of thermodynamic quantities. Back in 1990s these comparisons showed
a very high agreement between solar models and the Sun. However, the downward revision of the CNO
surface abundances in the Sun induced a drastic reduction of this agreement leading to the solar
modelling problem. More than ten years later, in the era of the space-based photometry missions
which have established asteroseismology of solar-like stars as a standard approach to obtain their
masses, radii and ages, the solar modelling problem still awaits a solution. We will present the
results of new helioseismic inversions, discuss the current uncertainties of solar models as well
as some possible solutions to the solar problem. We will show how helioseismology can help us grasp
what is amiss in our models. We will also show that, far from being an argument about details of solar
models, the solar problem has significant implications for seismology of solar-like stars, on
the main sequence and beyond, impacting asteroseismology as a whole as well as the fields requiring
precise and accurate knowledge of stellar masses, radii and ages, such as Galactic archaeology
and exoplanetology.
