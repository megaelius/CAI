We study the neutrino-induced production of nuclides in explosive supernova nucleosynthesis
for progenitor stars with solar metallicity including neutrino nucleus reactions for all nuclei
with charge numbers $Z < 76$ with average neutrino energies in agreement with modern Supernova simulations.
Considering progenitors with initial main sequence masses between 13~M$_\odot$ and 30~M$_\odot$,
we find a significant production of $^{11}$B, $^{138}$La, and $^{180}$Ta by neutrino nucleosynthesis,
despite the significantly reduced neutrino energies. The production of $^{19}$F turns out to be
more sensitive to the progenitor mass and structure than to the $\nu$ process. With our complete
set of cross sections we have identified effects of the $\nu$~process on several stable nuclei including
$^{33}$S, $^{40}$Ar, $^{41}$K, $^{59}$Co, and $^{113}$In at the 10\% level. Neutrino-induced
reactions contribute to a similar extent to the production of radioactive ${}^{26}$Al and increase
the yield of $^{22}$Na by 50\%. Future $\gamma$~ray astronomy missions may reach the precision
at which the contribution from the $\nu$~process becomes relevant. We find that the production
of $^{22}$Na by the $\nu$~process could explain the Ne-E(L) component of meteoritic graphite grains.
The $\nu$~process enhances the yield of $^{36}$Cl and we point out that the resulting $^{36}$Cl/$^{35}$Cl
ratio is in agreement with the values infrerred for the early solar system. Our extended set of neutrino-nucleus
interactions also allows us to exclude any further effects of the $\nu$ process on stable nuclei
and to quantify the effects on numerous, hitherto unconsidered radioactive nuclei, e.g., $^{36}$Cl,
$^{72}$As, $^{84}$Rb, and $^{88}$Y.
