In this thesis we will primarily demonstrate how additional scalar degrees of freedom - which are
motivated from many high-energy embeddings - open up new observational windows onto the physics
of inflation. We construct a Bayesian framework to statistically compare models with additional
fields given the current astronomical data. Putting inflation to the test, we perform our analysis
on the quadratic curvaton accompanying a range of inflationary potentials, where we find that only
one potential remains as a viable candidate. Furthermore, if the curvaton mechanism were to be confirmed
by future non-Gaussianity measurements (from large scale structure surveys), the model could
prove to be tremendously informative of the early inflationary history. The initial conditions
given to these scalar fields become apparent when considering their fundamentally quantum behaviour.
Taking this physics into account leads us to develop detailed models for post-inflationary phenomenology
(namely, the curvaton and freeze-in dark matter models) and to discover powerful new probes of inflation
itself. We further demonstrate how this theoretical study complements our statistical approach
by motivating the prior information in our Bayesian analyses. The thesis finishes with a discussion
of the future prospects for inflationary model selection. By hypothesising different toy survey
configurations, we forecast different outcomes using information theory and our newly developed
Bayesian experimental design formalism. In particular, we find that the most likely observable
to optimise model selection between single-field inflationary models, through an order of magnitude
precision improvement in the future, is the scalar spectral index. We conclude with a summary of
the results obtained throughout.
