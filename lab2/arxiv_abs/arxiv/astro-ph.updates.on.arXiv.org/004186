Combining the catalogue of galaxy morphologies in the COSMOS field and the sample of H$\alpha$ emitters
at redshifts $z=0.4$ and $z=0.84$ of the HiZELS survey, we selected $\sim$ 220 star-forming bulgeless
systems (S\'ersic index $n \leq 1.5$) at both epochs. We present their star formation properties
and we investigate their contribution to the star formation rate function (SFRF) and global star
formation rate density (SFRD) at $z < 1$. For comparison, we also analyse H$\alpha$ emitters with
more structurally evolved morphologies that we split into two classes according to their S\'ersic
index $n$: intermediate ($ 1.5 < n \leq 3 $) and bulge-dominated ($n > 3$). At both redshifts the SFRF
is dominated by the contribution of bulgeless galaxies and we show that they account for more than
60% of the cosmic SFRD at $z < 1$. The decrease of the SFRD with redshift is common to the three morphological
types but it is stronger for bulge-dominated systems. Star-forming bulgeless systems are mostly
located in regions of low to intermediate galaxy densities ($\Sigma \sim 1 - 4$ Mpc$^{-2}$) typical
of field-like and filament-like environments and their specific star formation rates (sSFRs)
do not appear to vary strongly with local galaxy density. Only few bulgeless galaxies in our sample
have high (sSFR $>$ 10$^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$) and these are mainly low-mass systems. Above $M_* \sim
10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ bulgeless are evolving at a "normal" rate (10$^{-9}$ yr$^{-1} <$ sSFR $<$10$^{-10}$
yr$^{-1}$) and in the absence of an external trigger (i.e. mergers/strong interactions) they might
not be able to develop a central classical bulge.
