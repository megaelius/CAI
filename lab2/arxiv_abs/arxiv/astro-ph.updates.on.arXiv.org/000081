We present a study exploring the impact of a starburst on the properties of the surrounding circum-galactic
medium (CGM): gas located beyond the galaxy's stellar body and extending out to the virial radius
(200 kpc). We obtained ultraviolet spectroscopic data from the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS)
probing the CGM of 20 low-redshift foreground galaxies using background QSOs. Our sample consists
of starburst and control galaxies. The latter comprises normal star-forming and passive galaxies
with similar stellar masses and impact parameters as the starbursts. We used optical spectra from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey(SDSS) to estimate the properties of the starbursts, inferring average
ages of 200 Myrs and burst fractions involving ~10% of their stellar mass. The COS data reveal highly
ionized gas traced by CIV in 80%(4/5) of the starburst and in 17%(2/12) of the control sample. The
two control galaxies with CIV absorbers differed from the four starbursts in showing multiple low-ionization
transitions and strong saturated Lyman-alpha lines. They therefore appear to be physically different
systems. We show that the CIV absorbers in the starburst CGM represent a significant baryon repository.
The high detection rate of this highly ionized material in the starbursts suggests that starburst-driven
winds can affect the CGM out to radii as large as 200 kpc. This is plausible given the inferred properties
of the starbursts and the known properties of starburst-driven winds. This would represent the
first direct observational evidence that local starbursts can impact the bulk of the gaseous halos
of their host galaxies, and as such provides new evidence of the importance of this kind of feedback
in the evolution of galaxies.
