Tunguska and Chelyabinsk impact events occurred inside a geographical area of only 3.4\% of the
Earth's surface. Although two events hardly constitute a statistically significant demonstration
of a geographical pattern of impacts, their spatial coincidence is at least tantalizing. To understand
if this concurrence reflects an underlying geographical and/or temporal pattern, we must aim at
predicting the spatio-temporal distribution of meteoroid impacts on Earth. For this purpose we
designed, implemented and tested a novel numerical technique, the "Gravitational Ray Tracing"
(GRT) designed to compute the relative impact probability (RIP) on the surface of any planet. GRT
is inspired by the so-called ray-casting techniques used to render realistic images of complex
3D scenes. In this paper we describe the method and the results of testing it at the time of large impact
events. Our findings suggest a non-trivial pattern of impact probabilities at any given time on
Earth. Locations at $60-90\deg$ from the apex are more prone to impacts, especially at midnight.
Counterintuitively, sites close to apex direction have the lowest RIP, while in the antapex RIP
are slightly larger than average. We present here preliminary maps of RIP at the time of Tunguska
and Chelyabinsk events and found no evidence of a spatial or temporal pattern, suggesting that their
coincidence was fortuitous. We apply the GRT method to compute theoretical RIP at the location and
time of 394 large fireballs. Although the predicted spatio-temporal impact distribution matches
marginally the observed events, we successfully predict their impact speed distribution.
