We aim to map the distribution and kinematics of molecular and ionized gas in a sample of active galaxies,
to quantify the nuclear inflows and outflows. Here, we analyze the nuclear kinematics of NGC 1566
via ALMA observations of the CO J:2-1 emission at 24 pc spatial and $\sim$2.6 km s$^{-1}$ spectral
resolution, and Gemini-GMOS/IFU observations of ionized gas emission lines and stellar absorption
lines at similar spatial resolution, and 123 km s$^{-1}$ of intrinsic spectral resolution. The
morphology and kinematics of stellar, molecular (CO) and ionized ([N II]) emission lines are compared
to the expectations from rotation, outflows, and streaming inflows. While both ionized and molecular
gas show rotation signatures, there are significant non-circular motions in the innermost 200
pc and along spiral arms in the central kpc (CO). The nucleus shows a double-peaked CO profile (Full
Width at Zero Intensity of 200 km s$^{-1}$), and prominent ($\sim$80 km s$^{-1}$) blue and redshifted
lobes are found along the minor axis in the inner arcseconds. Perturbations by the large-scale bar
can qualitatively explain all features in the observed velocity field. We thus favour the presence
of a molecular outflow in the disk with true velocities of $\sim$180 km s$^{-1}$ in the nucleus and
decelerating to 0 by $\sim$72 pc. The implied molecular outflow rate is $5.6~[M_{o}yr^{-1}]$,
with this gas accumulating in the nuclear 2 arcsec arms. The ionized gas kinematics support an interpretation
of a similar, but more spherical, outflow in the inner 100 pc, with no signs of deceleration. There
is some evidence of streaming inflows of $\sim$50 km s$^{-1}$ along specific spiral arms, and the
estimated molecular mass inflow rate, $\sim0.1~[M_{o}yr^{-1}]$, is significantly larger than
the SMBH accretion rate ($\dot{m}=4.8\times10^{-5}~[M_{o}yr^{-1}]$).
