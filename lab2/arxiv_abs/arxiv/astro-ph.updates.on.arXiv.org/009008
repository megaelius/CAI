Massive young stellar objects are known to undergo an evolutionary phase in which high mass accretion
rates drive strong outflows. A class of objects believed to trace this phase accurately is the GLIMPSE
Extended Green Object (EGO) sample, so named for the presence of extended 4.5 $\mu$m emission on
sizescales of $\sim$0.1 pc in \textit{Spitzer} images. We have been conducting a multi-wavelength
examination of a sample of 12 EGOs with distances of 1 to 5 kpc. In this paper, we present mid-infrared
images and photometry of these EGOs obtained with the SOFIA telescope, and subsequently construct
SEDs for these sources from the near-IR to sub-millimeter regimes using additional archival data.
We compare the results from greybody models and several publicly-available software packages
which produce model SEDs in the context of a single massive protostar. The models yield typical \rstar\/$\sim$10
\rsun, \tstar\/$\sim$10$^3$ to 10$^4$ K, and \lstar\/$\sim$1~$-$~40~$\times$~10$^3$ \lsun;
the median $L/M$ for our sample is 24.7 \lsun/\msun. Model results rarely converge for \rstar\/
and \tstar, but do for \lstar, which we take to be an indication of the multiplicity and inherently
clustered nature of these sources even though, typically, only a single source dominates in the
mid-infrared. The median $L/M$ value for the sample suggests that these objects may be in a transitional
stage between the commonly described ``IR-quiet'' and ``IR-bright'' stages of MYSO evolution.
The median $T_{dust}$ for the sample is less conclusive, but suggests that these objects are either
in this transitional stage or occupy the cooler (and presumably younger) part of the IR-bright stage.
