In solar flares, a large number of charged particles is accelerated to high energies. By which physical
processes this is achieved is one of the main open problems in solar physics. It has been suggested
that during a flare, regions of the rapidly relaxing magnetic field can form a collapsing magnetic
trap (CMT) and that this trap may contribute to particle energisation.} In this Research Note we
focus on a particular analytical CMT model based on kinematic magnetohydrodynamics. Previous
investigations of particle acceleration for this CMT model focused on the non-relativistic energy
regime. It is the specific aim of this Research Note to extend the previous work to relativistic particle
energies. Particle orbits were calculated numerically using the relativistic guiding centre
equations. We also calculated particle orbits using the non-relativistic guiding centre equations
for comparison. For mildly relativistic energies the relativistic and non-relativistic particle
orbits mainly agree well, but clear deviations are seen for higher energies. In particular, the
final particle energies obtained from the relativistic calculations are systematically lower
than the energies reached from the corresponding non-relativistic calculations, and the mirror
points of the relativistic orbits are systematically higher than for the corresponding non-relativistic
orbits. While the overall behaviour of particle orbits in CMTs does not differ qualitatively when
using the relativistic guiding centre equations, there are a few systematic quantitative differences
between relativistic and non-relativistic particle dynamics.
