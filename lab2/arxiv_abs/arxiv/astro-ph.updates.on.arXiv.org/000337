Abridged: The discovery of "hot Jupiters" very close to their parent stars confirmed that Jovian
planets migrate inward via several potential mechanisms. We present empirical constraints on
planet migration halting mechanisms. We compute model density functions of close-in exoplanets
in the orbital semi-major axis - stellar mass plane to represent planet migration that is halted
via several mechanisms, including the interior 1:2 resonance with the magnetospheric disk truncation
radius, the interior 1:2 resonance with the dust sublimation radius, and several scenarios for
tidal halting. The models differ in the predicted power law dependence of the exoplanet orbital
semi-major axis as a function stellar mass, and thus we also include a power law model with the exponent
as a free parameter. We use a Bayesian analysis to assess the model success in reproducing empirical
distributions of confirmed exoplanets and Kepler candidates that orbit interior to 0.1 AU. Our
results confirm a correlation of the halting distance with stellar mass. Tidal halting provides
the best fit to the empirical distribution of confirmed Jovian exoplanets at a statistically robust
level, consistent with the Kozai mechanism and the spin-orbit misalignment of a substantial fraction
of hot Jupiters. For Kepler candidates, which have a more restricted range in stellar mass compared
to confirmed planets, we are unable to discern between the tidal dissipation and magnetospheric
disk truncation braking mechanisms at a statistically significant level. The power law model favors
exponents in the range of 0.38-0.9. This is larger than that predicted for tidal halting (0.23-0.33),
which suggests that additional physics may be missing in the tidal halting theory.
