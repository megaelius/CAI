The secondary electrons and positrons (SEPs) generated by the hadronic interactions in supernova
remnants (SNRs) will give rise to synchrotron radiation in the magnetic field of the SNR shock, which
may be a powerful way to distinguish whether the gamma-ray emission from SNRs is leptonic or hadronic
origin, and whether cosmic rays are accelerated in SNR shocks. Here we provide a method that directly
use the observed gamma-ray flux from SNRs, created by pion decays, to derive the SEP distribution
and hence the synchrotron spectrum. We apply the method to SNRs RX J1713.7-3946, IC 443 and W44 and
find: (1) If the gamma-rays from the young SNR RX J1713.7-3946 are produced by hadronic interactions,
the SEP synchrotron radiation may show a spectral bump at $10^{-5}-10^{-2}$eV dominating the primary
electrons' synchrotron component, if the magnetic field in the SNR shock is $\gtrsim 0.5$mG; (2)
In the leptonic model for the gamma-rays from RX J1713.7-3946, the SEPs from subdominant hadronic
processes may still produce a flat synchrotron spectrum and a flux in the level of a few $10^{-13}
\rm erg~cm^{-2}s^{-1}$ at $\gtrsim100$ keV; (3) If the gamma-rays from middle-aged SNRs IC443
and W44 are produced by hadronic interactions, the SEP synchrotron radiation can well account for
the observed radio flux and spectral slopes, supporting the hadronic origin of the gamma-rays in
these two SNRs; (4) The requirement that the SEP radiation derived by the observed gamma-ray spectra,
assumed to be hadronic origin, cannot exceed the observed radio flux constrain the magnetic fields
in the SNR shocks to be $\lesssim 2$mG, $\lesssim 350 \mu$G, and $\lesssim400 \mu$G for RX J1713.7-3946,
IC 443 and W44, respectively. Future microwave to far-infrared and hard ($>100$~keV) X-ray observations
are encouraged to detect the SEP radiation, and constrain the SNR ability of cosmic ray acceleration.
