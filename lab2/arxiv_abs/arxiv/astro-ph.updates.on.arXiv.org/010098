The distinction between the mean anomaly $\mathcal{M}(t)$ and the mean anomaly at epoch $\eta$,
and the mean longitude $l(t)$ and the mean longitude at epoch $\epsilon$ is clarified in the context
of a possible use of such orbital elements in post-Keplerian tests of gravity, both Newtonian and
post-Newtonian. In particular, the perturbations induced on $\mathcal{M}(t),\,\eta,\,l(t),\,\epsilon$
by the post-Newtonian Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring fields, and the classical accelerations
due to the atmospheric drag and the oblateness $J_2$ of the central body are calculated for an arbitrary
orbital configuration of the test particle and a general orientation of the primary's spin axis
$\boldsymbol{\hat{S}}$. They provide us with further observables which could be fruitfully used,
e.g., in better characterizing astrophysical binary systems and in more accurate satellite-based
tests around major bodies of the Solar System. Some erroneous and misleading claims by Ciufolini
and Pavlis appeared in the literature are confuted. In particular, it is shown that there are no net
perturbations of the Lense-Thirring acceleration on either the semimajor axis $a$ and the mean
motion $n_\mathrm{b}$. Furthermore, the quadratic signatures on $\mathcal{M}(t)$ and $l(t)$
due to certain disturbing non-gravitational accelerations like the atmospheric drag can be effectively
disentangled from the post-Newtonian linear trends of interest provided that a sufficiently extended
temporal interval for the data analysis is assumed. A possible use of $\eta$ along with the longitudes
of the ascending node $\Omega$ in tests of general relativity with the existing LAGEOS and LAGEOS
II satellites is suggested.
