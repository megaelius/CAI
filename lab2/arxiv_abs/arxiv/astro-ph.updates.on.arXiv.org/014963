We present the study of three homologous solar eruptions from NOAA active region (AR) 11429 over
four days. This large and complex AR divided into two relatively simple sub-regions: northeast
(NE) and southwest (SW). Recurrent eruptions occurred from the SW sub-region over different evolutionary
phases, which provided a unique opportunity to isolate the physical processes responsible for
solar eruptions. Persistent shearing and convergence of opposite magnetic polarities led to continuous
flux cancellation along the SW polarity inversion line (PIL). A filament persistently lying along
the SW-PIL was observed to survive each eruption, which suggests the partial eruption of the magnetic
system. Further, following the first and second eruptions, a sigmoidal magnetic structure of similar
morphology was reformed along the SW-PIL. The photospheric motion of magnetic flux continuously
injected and stored the negative helicity in the partially erupted magnetic system and built up
the magnetic free energy for the successive eruptions. These results suggest that the shearing
motion and magnetic flux cancellation of opposite fluxes were: (1) the dominant factor, irrespective
of the evolutionary phase, that contributed to the recurrent homologous eruption, and (2) the key
processes of forming the erupting structure, likely a magnetic flux rope, and its long-lasting
continuation results in reformation of identical erupting structure. The study also finds that
similar magnetic topology could result in the magnetic reconnection at the same location, and such
flares during the precursor phase would help in the eruption by decreasing the constraint of overlying
magnetic field.
