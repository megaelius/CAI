We present results from our on-going MusE GAs FLOw and Wind (MEGAFLOW) survey, which consists of
22 quasar lines-of-sight, each observed with the integral field unit (IFU) MUSE and the UVES spectrograph
at the ESO Very Large Telescopes (VLT). The goals of this survey are to study the properties of the
circum-galactic medium around $z\sim1$ star-forming galaxies. The absorption-line selected
survey consists of 79 strong \MgII\ absorbers (with rest-frame equivalent width (REW)$\gtrsim$0.3\AA)
and, currently, 86 associated galaxies within 100 projected~kpc of the quasar with stellar masses
($M_\star$) from $10^9$ to $10^{11}$ \msun. We find that the cool halo gas traced by \MgII\ is not
isotropically distributed around these galaxies, as we show the strong bi-modal distribution
in the azimuthal angle of the apparent location of the quasar with respect to the galaxy major-axis.
This supports a scenario in which outflows are bi-conical in nature and co-exist with a coplanar
gaseous structure extending at least up to 60 to 80 kpc. Assuming that absorbers near the minor axis
probe outflows, the current MEGAFLOW sample allowed us to select 26 galaxy-quasar pairs suitable
for studying winds. From this sample, using a simple geometrical model, we find that the outflow
velocity only exceeds the escape velocity when $M_{\star}\lesssim 4\times10^9$~\msun, implying
the cool material is likely to fall back except in the smallest halos. Finally, we find that the mass
loading factor $\eta$, the ratio between the ejected mass rate and the star formation rate (SFR),
appears to be roughly constant with respect to the galaxy mass.
