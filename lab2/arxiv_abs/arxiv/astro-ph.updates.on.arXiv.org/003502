We investigate to which precision local magnification ratios, $\mathcal{J}$, ratios of convergences,
$f$, and reduced shears, $g = (g_{1}, g_{2})$, can be determined model-independently for the five
resolved multiple images of the source at $z_\mathrm{s}=1.675$ in CL0024. We also determine if
a comparison to the respective results obtained by the parametric modelling program Lenstool and
by the non-parametric modelling program Grale can detect biases in the lens models. For these model-based
approaches we additionally analyse the influence of the number and location of the constraints
from multiple images on the local lens properties determined at the positions of the five multiple
images of the source at $z_\mathrm{s}=1.675$. All approaches show high agreement on the local values
of $\mathcal{J}$, $f$, and $g$. We find that Lenstool obtains the tightest confidence bounds even
for convergences around one using constraints from six multiple image systems, while the best Grale
model is generated only using constraints from all multiple images with resolved brightness features
and adding limited small-scale mass corrections. Yet, confidence bounds as large as the values
themselves can occur for convergences close to one in all approaches. Our results are in agreement
with previous findings, supporting the light-traces-mass assumption and the merger hypothesis
for CL0024. Comparing the three different approaches allows to detect modelling biases. Given
that the lens properties remain approximately constant over the extension of the image areas covered
by the resolvable brightness features, the model-independent approach determines the local lens
properties to a comparable precision but within less than a second. (shortened)
