{We use all the published data in radio, optical and X-ray bands to analyze and model afterglows of
GW/GRB 170817A. Our analysis is based on a phenomenological gamma-ray burst generator model which
we previously used to study the prompt gamma-ray emission of this important transient. The data
is fit with a 3-component model. Taking into account relativistic beaming and off-axis view, we
interpret the model as approximately presenting the profile of a relativistic structured jet with
a rapidly declining Lorentz factor from our line of sight, where it was ultra-relativistic and had
a Lorentz factor of $\mathcal {O}(100)$, to outer boundaries where it became a mildly relativistic
cocoon with a relative velocity to light of $\sim 0.4-0.97$. Properties of the ultra-relativistic
core of this jet obtained here are consistent with conclusions from analysis of the prompt gamma-ray
emission. In particular, our results show that after prompt internal shocks the remnant of the jet
retains in some extent its internal collimation and coherence. Slow rise of the afterglows can be
associated to long distance from the merger, low column density of the jet when external shocks began,
and low density of circum-burst material. Long distance of circum-burst material from center could
have been in part responsible for thinning of the jet through expansion and energy dissipation before
occurrence of external shocks. We discuss implications of these observations for origin and properties
of circum-burst material around Binary Neutron Stars (BNS). This analysis confirms our previous
results showing that an outflow with a Lorentz factor of $\sim 2-5$ cannot explain observed afterglows
without an additional X-ray source or significant absorption of optical/IR photons.
