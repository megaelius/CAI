In this work we measure and study the cross-correlation signal between a foreground sample of GAMA
galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the range $0.2<z<0.8$, and a background sample of H-ATLAS
galaxies with photometric redshifts $\gtrsim1.2$. It constitutes a substantial improvement
over the cross-correlation measurements made by Gonzalez-Nuevo et al. (2014) with updated catalogues
and wider area (with $S/N\gtrsim 5$ below 10 arcmins and reaching $S/N\sim 20$ below 30 arcsecs).
The better statistics allow us to split the sample in different redshift bins and perform a tomographic
analysis (with $S/N\gtrsim 3$ below 10 arcmins and reaching $S/N\sim 15$ below 30 arcsecs). Moreover,
we implement a halo model to extract astrophysical information about the background galaxies and
the deflectors that are producing the lensing link between the foreground (lenses) and background
(sources) samples. In the case of the sources, we find typical masses values in agreement with previous
studies: a minimum halo mass to host a central galaxy, $M_{min}\sim 10^{12.23} M_\odot$, and a pivot
halo mass to have at least one sub-halo satellite, $M_1\sim 10^{12.85} M_\odot$. However, the lenses
are massive galaxies or even galaxy groups/clusters, with minimum mass of $M_{min}\sim 10^{13.06}
M_\odot$. Above a mass of $M_1\sim 10^{14.57} M_\odot$ they contain at least one additional satellite
galaxy which contributes to the lensing effect. The tomographic analysis shows that, while $M_1$
is almost redshift independent, there is a clear evolution of an increasing $M_{min}$ value with
redshift in agreement with theoretical estimations. Finally, the halo modeling allow us to identify
a strong lensing contribution to the cross-correlation for angular scales below 30 arcsecs. This
interpretation is supported by the results of basic but effective simulations.
