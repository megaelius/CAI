During the merger of two galaxies, the resulting system undergoes violent relaxation and seeks
stable equilibrium. However, the details of this evolution are not fully understood. Using Illustris
simulation, we probe two physically related processes, mixing and relaxation. Though the two are
driven by the same dynamics---global time-varying potential for the energy, and torques caused
by asymmetries for angular momentum---we measure them differently. We define mixing as the redistribution
of energy and angular momentum between particles of the two merging galaxies. We assess the degree
of mixing as the difference between the shapes of their N(E)s, and their N(L^2)s. We find that the
difference is decreasing with time, indicating mixing. To measure relaxation, we compare N(E)
of the newly merged system to N(E) of a theoretical prediction for relaxed collisionless systems,
DARKexp, and witness the system becoming more relaxed, in the sense that N(E) approaches DARKexp
N(E). Because the dynamics driving mixing and relaxation are the same, the timescale is similar
for both. We measure two sequential timescales: a rapid, 1 Gyr phase after the initial merger, during
which the difference in N(E) of the two merging halos decreases by ~80%, followed by a slow phase,
when the difference decreases by ~50% over ~8.5 Gyrs. This is a direct measurement of the relaxation
timescale. Our work also draws attention to the fact that when a galaxy has reached Jeans equilibrium
it may not yet have reached a fully relaxed state given by DARKexp, in that it retains information
about its past history. This manifests itself most strongly in stars being centrally concentrated.
We argue that it is particularly difficult for stars, and other tightly bound particles, to mix because
they have less time to be influenced by the fluctuating potential, even across multiple merger events.
