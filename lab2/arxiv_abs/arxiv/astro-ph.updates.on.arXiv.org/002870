Radio millisecond pulsars in binary systems are spun up to their present period by a Gyr-long phase
of accretion of the mass transferred from a low-mass companion star. Recently, three such systems
have been observed to switch between an accretion disk state and a radio pulsar regime over time-scales
ranging from weeks to years, and were dubbed transitional millisecond pulsars. These sources have
been often found in a sub-luminous accretion disk state, characterized by a lower X-ray luminosity
(~1E33-1E34 erg/s) than the level usually attained by similar sources during X-ray outbursts (~1E36
erg/s), and by a bright radio and gamma-ray emission. The physical mechanism acting in this enigmatic
state is still unclear. Here, we present the first detection of X-ray pulsations from the transitional
millisecond pulsar XSS J12270-4859. Pulsations were detected by XMM-Newton during an observation
performed while the source was in a sub-luminous accretion disk state. They had an rms amplitude
of (7.7+/-0.5)% with a second harmonic stronger than the the fundamental frequency, and were detected
when the source is neither flaring nor dipping. The most likely interpretation of this detection
is that matter from the accretion disk was channelled by the neutron star magnetosphere and accreted
onto its polar caps. According to standard disk accretion theory, for pulsations to be observed
the mass in-flow rate in the disk was likely larger than the amount of plasma actually reaching the
neutron star surface; an outflow launched by the fast rotating magnetosphere then probably took
place, in agreement with the observed broad-band spectral energy distribution.We also report
about the non-detection of X-ray pulsations during an observation performed while the source behaved
as a rotationally-powered radio pulsar.
