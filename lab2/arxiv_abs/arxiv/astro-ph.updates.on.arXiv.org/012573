We constrain the rest-frame FUV (1546\AA), NUV (2345\AA) and U-band (3690\AA) luminosity functions
(LFs) and luminosity densities (LDs) with unprecedented precision from $z \sim 0.2$ up to $z \sim
3$ (FUV, NUV) and $z \sim 2$ (U band). Our sample of more than 4.3 million galaxies, selected from the
CFHT Large Area $U$-band Deep Survey (CLAUDS) and HyperSuprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP)
data lets us probe the very faint regime (down to $M_\mathrm{FUV}$, $M_\mathrm{NUV}$, $M_\mathrm{U}
\simeq -15$) while simultaneously detecting very rare galaxies at the bright end down to comoving
densities $<10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. Our FUV and NUV LFs are well fitted by a single Schechter function,
with faint-end slopes that are very stable up to $z\sim 2$. We confirm, but self-consistently and
with much better precision than previous findings that the LDs at all three wavelengths increase
rapidly with lookback time to $z\sim1$, and then much more slowly at $1<z<2$-$3$. Evolution of the
FUV and NUV LFs and LDs at $z<1$ is driven almost entirely by the fading of the characteristic magnitude,
$M^\star_{UV}$, while at $z>1$ it is due to the evolution of both $M^\star_{UV}$ and the characteristic
number density $\phi^\star_{UV}$. In contrast, the U-band LF has an excess of faint galaxies and
is fitted with a double-Schechter form; $M^\star_\mathrm{U}$ and both $\phi^\star_\mathrm{U}$
components, as well as the bright-end slope evolve throughout $0.2<z<2$, while the faint-end slope
appears to be constant over $0.05 < z < 0.6$ (where the double-Schechter profile of the U-band LF is
undeniable), at least. We present tables of our Schechter parameters and LD measurements that can
be used for testing theoretical galaxy evolution models and forecasting future observations.
