Directly-imaged exoplanets are unexplored laboratories for the application of the spectral and
temperature retrieval method, where the chemistry and composition of their atmospheres are inferred
from inverse modeling of the available data. As a pilot study, we focus on the extrasolar gas giant
HR 8799b for which more than 50 data points are available. We upgrade our non-linear optimal estimation
retrieval method to include a phenomenological model of clouds that requires the cloud optical
depth and monodisperse particle size to be specified. Previous studies have focused on forward
models with assumed values of the exoplanetary properties; there is no consensus on the best-fit
values of the radius, mass, surface gravity and effective temperature of HR 8799b. We show that cloudfree
models produce reasonable fits to the data if the atmosphere is of super-solar metallicity and non-solar
elemental abundances. Intermediately cloudy models with moderate values of the cloud optical
depth and micron-sized particles provide a marginally better fit to the data and require a lower
mean molecular weight. There is a mismatch between the photospheric and model radii, which we term
the "radius ratio problem" and has been encountered in previous studies. By virtue of using an inverse
model, we confirm that the radius ratio problem is not due to inadequacies with the evolutionary
models. We report our best-fit values for the radius, mass, surface gravity and effective temperature
of HR 8799b. The mean molecular weight is about 3.8, while the carbon-to-oxygen ratio is about unity
due to the prevalence of carbon monoxide. Our study emphasizes the need for robust claims about the
nature of an exoplanetary atmosphere to be based on analyses involving both photometry and spectroscopy
and inferred from beyond a few photometric data points, such as are typically reported for hot Jupiters.
