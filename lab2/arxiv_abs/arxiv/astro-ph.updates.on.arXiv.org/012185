Constraining the composition of super-Earth-to-sub-Neptune-size planets is a priority to understand
the processes of planetary formation and evolution. pi Men c represents a unique target for the atmospheric
and compositional characterization of such planets because it is strongly irradiated and its bulk
density is consistent with abundant H2O. We searched for hydrogen from photodissociating H2/H2O
in pi Men c's upper atmosphere through H i Ly-alpha transmission spectroscopy with the Hubble Space
Telescope's STIS instrument, but did not detect it. We set 1 (3) upper limits for the effective planet-to-star
size ratio RLy-alpha/Rearth=0.13 (0.24) and 0.12 (0.20) at velocities [-215,-91] km/s and [+57,+180]
km/s, respectively. We reconstructed the stellar spectrum, and estimate that Men c receives about
1350 erg cm-2 s-1 of 5-912-Angstroms-energy, enough to cause rapid atmospheric escape. An interesting
scenario to explain the non-detection is that Men c's atmosphere is dominated by H2O or other heavy
molecules rather than H2/He. According to our models, abundant oxygen results in less extended
atmospheres, which transition from neutral to ionized hydrogen closer to the planet. We compare
our non-detection to other detection attempts, and tentatively identify two behaviors: planets
with densities <2 g cm-3 (and likely hydrogen-dominated atmospheres) result in H i Ly-alpha absorption,
whereas planets with densities >3 g cm-3 (and plausibly non-hydrogen-dominated atmospheres)
do not result in measurable absorption. Investigating a sample of strongly-irradiated sub-Neptunes
may provide some statistical confirmation if it is shown that they do not generally develop extended
atmospheres.
