We use a combination of high-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) radio and multi-wavelength
flux density and polarization observations to constrain the physics of the dissipation mechanism
powering the broadband flares in 3C 279 during an episode of extreme flaring activity in 2013-2014.
Six bright flares superimposed on a long-term outburst are detected at $\gamma$-ray energies.
Four of the flares have optical and radio counterparts. The two modes of flaring activity (faster
flares sitting on top of a long term outburst) present at radio, optical, $\gamma$-ray frequencies
are missing in X-rays. X-ray counterparts are only observed for two flares. The first three flares
are accompanied by ejection of a new VLBI component (NC2) suggesting the 43 GHz VLBI core as the site
of energy dissipation. Another new component, NC3, is ejected after the last three flares, which
suggests that the emission is produced upstream from the core (closer to the black hole). The study
therefore indicates multiple sites of energy dissipation in the source. An anti-correlation is
detected between the optical percentage polarization (PP) and optical/$\gamma$-ray flux variations,
while the PP has a positive correlation with optical/$\gamma$-rays spectral indices. Given that
the mean polarization is inversely proportional to the number of cells in the emission region, the
PP vs. optical/$\gamma$-ray anti-correlation could be due to more active cells during the outburst
than at other times. In addition to the turbulent component, our analysis suggests the presence
of a combined turbulent and ordered magnetic field, with the ordered component transverse to the
jet axis.
