We present SCExAO/CHARIS 1.1--2.4 micron integral field direct spectroscopy of the young HIP 79124
triple system. HIP 79124 is a member of the Scorpius-Centaurus association, consisting of an A0V
primary with two low-mass companions at a projected separation of <1 arcsecond. Thanks to the high
quality wavefront corrections provided by SCExAO, both companions are decisively detected without
the employment of any PSF-subtraction algorithm to eliminate quasi-static noise. The spectrum
of the outer C object is very well matched by Upper Scorpius M4 pm 0.5 standard spectra, with a Teff
= 2945 pm 100 and a mass of 350 MJup. HIP 79124 B is detected at a separation of only 180 mas in a highly-correlated
noise regime, and it falls in the spectral range M6 pm 0.5 with Teff = 2840 pm 190 and 100 MJup. Previous
studies of stellar populations in Sco-Cen have highlighted a discrepancy in isochronal ages between
the low-mass and high-mass populations. This could be explained either by a mass-dependent age
gradient in the region, or by conventional isochronal models failing to reproduce the evolution
of low-mass stars. The HIP 79124 system should be coeval, and therefore it provides an ideal laboratory
to test these scenarios. We place the three components in a color-magnitude diagram and find that
the models predict a younger age for the two low-mass companions (3 Myr) than for the primary star
(6 Myr). These results imply that the omission of magnetic effects in conventional isochronal models
inhibit them from reproducing early low-mass stellar evolution, which is further supported by
the fact that new models that include such effects provide more consistent ages in the HIP 79124 system.
