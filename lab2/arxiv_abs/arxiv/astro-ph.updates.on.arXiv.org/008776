High power Earth and orbital-based directed energy (DE) systems pose a potential hazard to Earth
orbiting spacecraft. The use of very high power, large aperture DE systems to propel spacecraft
is being pursued as the only known, feasible method to achieve relativistic flight in our NASA Starlight
and Breakthrough Starshot programs. In addition, other beamed power mission scenarios, such as
orbital debris removal and our NASA program using DE for powering high performance ion engine missions,
pose similar concerns. It is critical to quantify the probability and rates of interception of the
DE beam with the approximately 2000 active Earth orbiting spacecraft. We have modeled the interception
of the beam with satellites by using their orbital parameters and computing the likelihood of interception
for many of the scenarios of the proposed systems we are working on. We are able to simulate both the
absolute interception as well as the distance and angle from the beam to the spacecraft, and have
modeled a number of scenarios to obtain general probabilities. We have established that the probability
of beam interception of any active satellite, including its orbital position uncertainty, during
any of the proposed mission scenarios is low ($\approx10^{-4}$). The outcome of this work gives
us the ability to predict when to energize the beam without intercept, as well as the capability to
turn off the DE as needed for extended mission scenarios. As additional satellites are launched,
our work can be readily extended to accommodate them. Our work can also be used to predict interception
of astronomical adaptive optics guide-star lasers as well as more general laser use.
