It is well known that there is temporal relationship between coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and associated
flares. The duration of the acceleration phase is related to the duration of the rise phase of a flare.
We investigate CMEs associated with slow long duration events (LDEs), i.e. flares with the long
rising phase. We determined the relationships between flares and CMEs and analyzed the CME kinematics
in detail. The parameters of the flares (GOES flux, duration of the rising phase) show strong correlations
with the CME parameters (velocity, acceleration during main acceleration phase and duration of
the CME acceleration phase). These correlations confirm the strong relation between slow LDEs
and CMEs. We also analyzed the relation between the parameters of the CMEs, i.e. a velocity, an acceleration
during the main acceleration phase, a duration of the acceleration phase, and a height of a CME at
the end of the acceleration phase. The CMEs associated with the slow LDEs are characterized by high
velocity during the propagation phase, with the median equal 1423 km/s. In half of the analyzed cases,
the main acceleration was low (a<300 m/s^2), which suggests that the high velocity is caused
by the prolongated acceleration phase (the median for the duration of the acceleration phase is
equal 90 minutes). The CMEs were accelerated up to several solar radii (with the median 7 Rsun), which
is much higher than in typical impulsive CMEs. Therefore, slow LDEs may potentially precede extremely
strong geomagnetic storms. The analysis of slow LDEs and associated CMEs may give important information
for developing more accurate space weather forecasts, especially for extreme events.
