Snowlines are key ingredients for planet formation. Providing observational constraints on the
locations of the major snowlines is therefore crucial for fully connecting planet compositions
to their formation mechanism. Unfortunately, the most important snowline, that of water, is very
difficult to observe directly in protoplanetary disks due to its close proximity to the central
star. Based on chemical considerations, HCO$^+$ is predicted to be a good chemical tracer of the
water snowline, because it is particularly abundant in dense clouds when water is frozen out. This
work maps the optically thin isotopologue H$^{13}$CO$^+$ ($J=3-2$) toward the envelope of the
low-mass protostar NGC1333-IRAS2A (observed with NOEMA at ~0.9" resolution), where the snowline
is at larger distance from the star than in disks. The H$^{13}$CO$^+$ emission peaks ~2" northeast
of the continuum peak, whereas the previously observed H$_2^{18}$O shows compact emission on source.
Quantitative modeling shows that a decrease in H$^{13}$CO$^+$ abundance by at least a factor of
six is needed in the inner ~360 AU to reproduce the observed emission profile. Chemical modeling
predicts indeed a steep increase in HCO$^+$ just outside the water snowline; the 50% decrease in
gaseous H$_2$O at the snowline is not enough to allow HCO$^+$ to be abundant. This places the water
snowline at 225 AU, further away from the star than expected based on the 1D envelope temperature
structure for NGC1333-IRAS2A. In contrast, DCO$^+$ observations show that the CO snowline is at
the expected location, making an outburst scenario unlikely. The spatial anticorrelation of the
H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and H$_2^{18}$O emission provide a proof of concept that H$^{13}$CO$^+$ can be
used as a tracer of the water snowline.
