From mock Hubble Space Telescope images, we quantify non-parametric statistics of galaxy morphology,
thereby predicting the emergence of relationships among stellar mass, star formation, and observed
rest-frame optical structure at 1 < z < 3. We measure these diagnostics of galaxy morphology
from cosmological simulations of the formation of 22 central galaxies with 9.3 < log_10 M_*/M_sun
< 10.7. These high-spatial-resolution zoom-in calculations enable accurate modeling of the
rest-frame UV and optical morphology. This could depend strongly on dust radiative transfer, which
we model using the Sunrise code. Even with small numbers of galaxies, we find that structural evolution
is neither universal nor monotonic: galaxy interactions may trigger either bulge or disc formation,
and optically bulge-dominated galaxies at this mass may not remain so forever. Simulated galaxies
with M_* > 10^10 M_sun contain relatively more disc-dominated light profiles than those with
lower mass, reflecting significant disc brightening in some haloes at 1 < z < 2. By this epoch,
simulated galaxies with specific star formation rates below 10^-9.7 yr^-1 are more likely than
normal star-formers to have a broader mix of structural types, especially at M_* > 10^10 M_sun.
We analyze a cosmological major merger at z~1.5 and find that the newly proposed MID morphology diagnostics
trace later stages while G-M20 trace earlier ones. MID is sensitive also to clumpy star-forming
discs. The observability time of typical MID-enhanced events in our simulation sample is less than
100 Myr. A larger sample of cosmological assembly histories may be required to calibrate such diagnostics
in the face of their sensitivity to viewing angle, segmentation algorithm, and various phenomena
such as clumpy star formation and minor mergers.
