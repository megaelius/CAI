Cosmic shear, the weak gravitational lensing caused by the large-scale structure, is one of the
primary probes to test gravity with current and future surveys. There are two main techniques to
analyse a cosmic shear survey; a tomographic method, where correlations between the lensing signal
in different redshift bins are used to recover redshift information, and a 3D approach, where the
full redshift information is carried through the entire analysis. Here we compare the two methods,
by forecasting cosmological constraints for future surveys like Euclid. We extend the 3D formalism
for the first time to theories beyond the standard model, belonging to the Horndeski class. This
includes the majority of universally coupled extensions to {\Lambda}CDM with one scalar degree
of freedom in addition to the metric, which are still in agreement with current observations. Given
a fixed background, the evolution of linear perturbations in Horndeski gravity is described by
a set of four functions of time only. We model their time evolution assuming proportionality to the
dark energy density fraction and place Fisher matrix constraints on the proportionality coefficients.
We find that a 3D analysis can constrain Horndeski theories better than a tomographic one, in particular
with a decrease in the errors on the Horndeski parameters of the order of 20 - 30$\%$. This paper shows
for the first time a quantitative comparison on an equal footing between Fisher matrix forecasts
for both a fully 3D and a tomographic analysis of cosmic shear surveys. The increased sensitivity
of the 3D formalism comes from its ability to retain information on the source redshifts along the
entire analysis.
