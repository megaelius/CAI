By measuring precise radial velocities of planetary nebulae (which belong to the intermediate
age population), H II regions, and A-type supergiant stars (which are members of the young population)
in NGC 6822, we aim to determine if both types of population share the kinematics of the disk of H I found
in this galaxy. Spectroscopic data for four planetary nebulae were obtained with the high spectral
resolution spectrograph Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle (MIKE) on the Magellan telescope at
Las Campanas Observatory. Data for other three PNe and one H II region were obtained from the SPM Catalog
of Extragalactic Planetary Nebulae which employed the Manchester Echelle Spectrometer attached
to the 2.1m telescope at the Observatorio Astron\'omico Nacional, M\'exico. In the wavelength
calibrated spectra, the heliocentric radial velocities were measured with a precision better
than 5-6 km s$^{-1}$. Data for three additional H II regions and a couple of A-type supergiant stars
were collected from the literature. The heliocentric radial velocities of the different objects
were compared to the velocities of the H i disk at the same position. From the analysis of radial velocities
it is found that H II regions and A-type supergiants do share the kinematics of the H I disk at the same
position, as expected for these young objects. On the contrary, planetary nebula velocities differ
significantly from that of the H I at the same position. The kinematics of planetary nebulae is independent
from the young population kinematics and it is closer to the behavior shown by carbon stars, which
are intermediate-age members of the stellar spheroid existing in this galaxy. Our results are confirming
that there are at least two very different kinematical systems in NGC 6822.
