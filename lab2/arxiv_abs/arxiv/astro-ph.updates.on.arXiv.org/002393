Residual errors in shear measurements, after corrections for instrument systematics and atmospheric
effects, can impact cosmological parameters derived from weak lensing observations. Here we combine
convergence maps from our suite of ray-tracing simulations with random realizations of spurious
shear with a power spectrum estimated for the LSST instrument. This allows us to quantify the errors
and biases of the triplet $(\Omega_m,w,\sigma_8)$ derived from the power spectrum (PS), as well
as from three different sets of non-Gaussian statistics of the lensing convergence field: Minkowski
functionals (MF), low--order moments (LM), and peak counts (PK). Our main results are: (i) We find
an order of magnitude smaller biases from the PS than in previous work. (ii) The PS and LM yield biases
much smaller than the morphological statistics (MF, PK). (iii) For strictly Gaussian spurious
shear with integrated amplitude as low as its current estimate of $\sigma^2_{sys}\approx 10^{-7}$,
biases from the PS and LM would be unimportant even for a survey with the statistical power of LSST.
However, we find that for surveys larger than $\approx 100$ deg$^2$, non-Gaussianity in the noise
(not included in our analysis) will likely be important and must be quantified to assess the biases.
(iv) The morphological statistics (MF,PK) introduce important biases even for Gaussian noise,
which must be corrected in large surveys. The biases are in different directions in $(\Omega_m,w,\sigma_8)$
parameter space, allowing self-calibration by combining multiple statistics. Our results warrant
follow-up studies with more extensive lensing simulations and more accurate spurious shear estimates.
