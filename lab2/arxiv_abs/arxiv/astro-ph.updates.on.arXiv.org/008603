Gamma-ray astronomy explores the most energetic photons in nature to address some of the most pressing
puzzles in contemporary astrophysics. It encompasses a wide range of objects and phenomena: stars,
supernovae, novae, neutron stars, stellar-mass black holes, nucleosynthesis, the interstellar
medium, cosmic rays and relativistic-particle acceleration, and the evolution of galaxies. MeV
gamma-rays provide a unique probe of nuclear processes in astronomy, directly measuring radioactive
decay, nuclear de-excitation, and positron annihilation. The substantial information carried
by gamma-ray photons allows us to see deeper into these objects, the bulk of the power is often emitted
at gamma-ray energies, and radioactivity provides a natural physical clock that adds unique information.
New science will be driven by time-domain population studies at gamma-ray energies. This science
is enabled by next-generation gamma-ray instruments with one to two orders of magnitude better
sensitivity, larger sky coverage, and faster cadence than all previous gamma-ray instruments.
This transformative capability permits: (a) the accurate identification of the gamma-ray emitting
objects and correlations with observations taken at other wavelengths and with other messengers;
(b) construction of new gamma-ray maps of the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies where extended
regions are distinguished from point sources; and (c) considerable serendipitous science of scarce
events -- nearby neutron star mergers, for example. Advances in technology push the performance
of new gamma-ray instruments to address a wide set of astrophysical questions.
