We report the first discovery of a fast radio burst (FRB), FRB 20200125A, by the Green Bank Northern
Celestial Cap (GBNCC) Pulsar Survey conducted with the Green Bank Telescope at 350 MHz. FRB 20200125A
was detected at a Galactic latitude of 58.43 degrees with a dispersion measure of 179 pc cm$^{-3}$,
while electron density models predict a maximum Galactic contribution of 25 pc cm$^{-3}$ along
this line of sight. Moreover, no apparent Galactic foreground sources of ionized gas that could
account for the excess DM are visible in multi-wavelength surveys of this region. This argues that
the source is extragalactic. The maximum redshift for the host galaxy is $z_{max}=0.17$, corresponding
to a maximum comoving distance of approximately 750 Mpc. The measured peak flux density for FRB 20200125A
is 0.37 Jy, and we measure a pulse width of 3.7 ms, consistent with the distribution of FRB widths observed
at higher frequencies. Based on this detection and assuming an Euclidean flux density distribution
of FRBs, we calculate an all-sky rate at 350 MHz of $3.4^{+15.4}_{-3.3} \times 10^3$ FRBs sky$^{-1}$
day$^{-1}$ above a peak flux density of 0.42 Jy for an unscattered pulse having an intrinsic width
of 5 ms, consistent with rates reported at higher frequencies. Given the recent improvements in
our single-pulse search pipeline, we also revisit the GBNCC survey sensitivity to various burst
properties. Finally, we find no evidence of interstellar scattering in FRB 20200125A, adding to
the growing evidence that some FRBs have circumburst environments where free-free absorption
and scattering are not significant.
