Using a sample of 4 galaxy clusters at $0.85 < z < 1.35$ and 10 galaxy clusters at $0.85 < z < 1.35$, we
measure the environmental quenching timescale, $t_Q$, corresponding to the time required after
a galaxy is accreted by a cluster for it to fully cease star formation. Cluster members are selected
by a photometric-redshift criterion, and categorized as star-forming, quiescent, or intermediate
according to their dust-corrected rest-frame colors and magnitudes. We employ a "delayed-then-rapid"
quenching model that relates a simulated cluster mass accretion rate to the observed numbers of
each type of galaxy in the cluster to constrain $t_Q$. For galaxies of mass $M_* \gtrsim 10^{10.5}~
\mathrm{M}_\odot$, we find a quenching timescale of $t_Q=$ 1.24 Gyr in the $z\sim1.5$ cluster sample,
and $t_Q=$ 1.50 Gyr at $z\sim1$. Using values drawn from the literature, we compare the redshift
evolution of $t_Q$ to timescales predicted for different physical quenching mechanisms. We find
$t_Q$ to depend on host halo mass such that quenching occurs over faster timescales in clusters relative
to groups, suggesting that properties of the host halo are responsible for quenching high-mass
galaxies. The environmental quenching timescale evolves faster from $z=0$ to $z=1.5$ than the
molecular gas depletion timescale and slower than an SFR-outflow timescale, but is consistent
with the evolution of the dynamical time. Between $z=0$ and $z=1.5$, we find that $t_Q$ evolves faster
than the molecular gas depletion timescale and slower than an SFR-outflow timescale, but is consistent
with the evolution of the dynamical time. This suggests that environmental quenching in these galaxies
is driven by the motion of satellites relative to the cluster environment, although due to uncertainties
in the atomic gas budget at high redshift, we cannot rule out quenching due to simple gas depletion.
