The search for antideuterons in cosmic rays has been proposed as a promising channel for dark matter
indirect detection, especially for dark matter particles with a low or intermediate mass. With
the current operational phase of the AMS-02 experiment and the ongoing development of a future dedicated
experiment, the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS), there are exciting prospects for a
dark matter detection in the near future. In this paper we develop a detailed and complete re-analysis
of the cosmic-ray antideuteron signal, by discussing the main relevant issues related to antideuteron
production and propagation through the interstellar medium and the heliosphere. In particular,
we first critically revisit the coalescence mechanism for antideuteron production in dark matter
annihilation processes. Then, since antideuteron searches have their best prospects of detection
at low kinetic energies where the effect of the solar wind and magnetic field are most relevant, we
address the impact of solar modulation modeling on the antideuteron flux at the Earth by developing
a full numerical 4D solution of cosmic rays transport in the heliosphere. We finally use these improved
predictions to provide updated estimates of the reaching capabilities for AMS-02 and GAPS, compatible
with the current constraints imposed by the antiprotons measurements of PAMELA. After the antiproton
bound is applied, prospects of detection of up to about 15 events in GAPS LDB+ and AMS-02 missions
are found, depending on the dark matter mass, annihilation rate and production channel from one
side, and on the coalescence process, galactic and solar transport parameters on the other.
