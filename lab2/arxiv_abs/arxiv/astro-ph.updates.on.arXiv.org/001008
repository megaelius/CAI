We present the results of a series of cosmological $N$-body simulations of a Vector Dark Energy (VDE)
model, performed using a suitably modified version of the publicly available \texttt{GADGET}-2
code. The setups of our simulations were calibrated pursuing a twofold aim: 1) to analyze the large
scale distribution of massive objects and 2) to determine the properties of halo structure in this
different ramework.We observe that structure formation is enhanced in VDE, since the mass function
at high redshift is boosted up to a factor of ten with respect to \LCDM, possibly alleviating tensions
with the observations of massive clusters at high redshifts and early reionization epoch. Significant
differences can also be found for the value of the growth factor, that in VDE shows a completely different
behaviour, and in the distribution of voids, which in this cosmology are on average smaller and less
abundant. We further studied the structure of dark matter haloes more massive than $5\times10^{13}$\hMsun,
finding that no substantial difference emerges when comparing spin parameter, shape, triaxiality
and profiles of structures evolved under different cosmological pictures. Nevertheless, minor
differences can be found in the concentration-mass relation and the two point correlation function;
both showing different amplitudes and steeper slopes.Using an additional series of simulations
of a \LCDM\ scenario with the same $\Omega_M$ and $\sigma_8$ used in the VDE cosmology, we have been
able to establish whether the modifications induced in the new cosmological picture were due to
the particular nature of the dynamical dark energy or a straightforward consequence of the cosmological
parameters.
