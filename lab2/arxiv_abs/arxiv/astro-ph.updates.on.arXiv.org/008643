Barium stars are peculiar red giants characterized by an overabundance of s-process elements along
with an enrichment in carbon. These stars are discovered in binaries with white dwarf companions.
The more recently formed of these stars are still surrounded by a planetary nebula. Precise abundance
determinations of the various s-process elements, especially, of the lightest, short-lived radionuclide
technetium will establish constraints for the formation of s-process elements in asymptotic giant
branch stars as well as mass transfer through, for example, stellar wind, Roche-lobe overflow,
and common-envelope evolution. We performed a detailed spectral analysis of the K-type subgiant
central star of the planetary nebula Hen 2-39 based on high-resolution optical spectra obtained
with the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope using LTE model
atmospheres. We confirm the effective temperature of $T_\mathrm{eff} = 4350 \pm 150$ K for the central
star of the planetary nebula Hen 2-39. It has a photospheric carbon enrichment of $[\mathrm{C/H}]=
0.36 \pm 0.08$ and a barium overabundance of $[\mathrm{Ba/Fe}]= 1.8 \pm 0.5$. We find a deficiency
for most of the iron-group elements (calcium to iron) and establish an upper abundance limit for
technetium ($\log \epsilon_\mathrm{Tc} < 2.5$). The quality of the available optical spectra
is not sufficient to measure abundances of all s-process elements accurately. Despite large uncertainties
on the abundances as well as on the model yields, the derived abundances are most consistent with
a progenitor mass in the range 1.75-3.00 $M_\odot$ and a metallicity of $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]= -0.3
\pm 1.0$. This result leads to the conclusion that the formation of such systems requires a relatively
large mass transfer that is most easily obtained via wind-Roche lobe overflow.
