We compile from the literature many local galaxy samples (mostly from follow-up radio observations
of optically-selected samples) with available information on stellar mass, morphology, and HI
and/or $H_{2}$ gas content. After homogenizing the data and handling adequately the reported upper
limits in the case of non gas detections, we determine the $HI$- and $H_{2}$-to-stellar mass correlations
(mean and standard deviation) of galaxies separated into two main populations, late- and early-type
galaxies (LTGs and ETGs, respectively). The correlations are described by either a single or double
power law, but at the low-mass side, some hints of flattening are found, with transition masses close
to the one that separates normal and dwarf galaxies, $M_{\ast}\approx 1-2\times 10^{9}M_{\odot}$.
LTGs are significantly gas richer than ETGs, specially at the highest masses. The respective $H_{2}$-to-$HI$
mass ratios as a function of $M_{\ast}$ are presented. Further, we attempt to constrain the corresponding
full distributions of the $HI$- and $H_{2}$-to-stellar mass ratios as a function of $M_{\ast}$
for both LTGs and ETGs. A Schechter function for the former and a (broken) Schechter + uniform function
for the latter, with the function parameters depending on $M_{\ast}$, provide reasonable descriptions
of the data (detections and non detections). By using the observed galaxy stellar mass function
and volume-complete fractions of LTGs/ETGs as a function of $M_{\ast}$, these empirical distributions
are mapped into $HI$ and $H_{2}$ mass functions. The obtained total $HI$ and $H_{2}$ mass functions
are in reasonable agreement with those inferred from observations. The empirical gas-to-stellar
mass correlations and distributions for local LTGs and ETGs presented here can be used to constrain
models and simulations of galaxy evolution.
