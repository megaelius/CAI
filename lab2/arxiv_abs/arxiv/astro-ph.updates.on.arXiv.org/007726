IGR J16493-4348 is an eclipsing supergiant high-mass X-ray binary (sgHMXB), where accretion onto
the compact object occurs via the radially outflowing stellar wind of its early B-type companion.
We present an analysis of the system's X-ray variability and periodic modulation using pointed
observations (2.5-25 keV) and Galactic bulge scans (2-10 keV) from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer
(RXTE) Proportional Counter Array (PCA), along with Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) 70-month
snapshot (14-195 keV) and transient monitor (15-50 keV) observations. The orbital eclipse profiles
in the PCA bulge scans and BAT light curves are modeled using asymmetric and symmetric step and ramp
functions. We obtain an improved orbital period measurement of 6.7828 $\pm$ 0.0004 days from an
observed minus calculated (O-C) analysis of mid-eclipse times derived from the BAT transient monitor
and PCA scan data. No evidence is found for the presence of a strong photoionization or accretion
wake. We refine the superorbital period to 20.067 $\pm$ 0.009 days from the discrete Fourier transform
(DFT) of the BAT transient monitor light curve. A pulse period of 1093.1036 $\pm$ 0.0004 s is measured
from a pulsar timing analysis using pointed PCA observations spanning $\sim$1.4 binary orbits.
We present pulse times of arrival (ToAs), circular and eccentric timing models, and calculations
of the system's Keplerian binary orbital parameters. We derive an X-ray mass function of $f_{x}(M)$
$=$ 13.2$^{+2.4}_{-2.5}$ $M_{\odot}$ and find a spectral type of B0.5 Ia for the supergiant companion
through constraints on the mass and radius of the donor. Measurements of the eclipse half-angle
and additional parameters describing the system geometry are provided.
