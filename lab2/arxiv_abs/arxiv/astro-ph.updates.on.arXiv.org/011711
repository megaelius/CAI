It remains a major challenge to derive a theory of cloud-scale ($\lesssim100$ pc) star formation
and feedback, describing how galaxies convert gas into stars as a function of the galactic environment.
Progress has been hampered by a lack of robust empirical constraints on the giant molecular cloud
(GMC) lifecycle. We address this problem by systematically applying a new statistical method for
measuring the evolutionary timeline of the GMC lifecycle, star formation, and feedback to a sample
of nine nearby disc galaxies, observed as part of the PHANGS-ALMA survey. We measure the spatially-resolved
($\sim100$ pc) CO-to-H$\alpha$ flux ratio and find a universal de-correlation between molecular
gas and young stars on GMC scales, allowing us to quantify the underlying evolutionary timeline.
GMC lifetimes are short, typically 10-30 Myr, and exhibit environmental variation, between and
within galaxies. At kpc-scale molecular gas surface densities $\Sigma_{\rm H_2}\geqslant8$M$_{\odot}$pc$^{-2}$,
the GMC lifetime correlates with time-scales for galactic dynamical processes, whereas at $\Sigma_{\rm
H_2}\leqslant8$M$_{\odot}$pc$^{-2}$ GMCs decouple from galactic dynamics and live for an internal
dynamical time-scale. After a long inert phase without massive star formation traced by H$\alpha$
(75-90% of the cloud lifetime), GMCs disperse within just 1-5 Myr once massive stars emerge. The
dispersal is most likely due to early stellar feedback, causing GMCs to achieve integrated star
formation efficiencies of 4-10% These results show that galactic star formation is governed by
cloud-scale, environmentally-dependent, dynamical processes driving rapid evolutionary cycling.
GMCs and HII regions are the fundamental units undergoing these lifecycles, with mean separations
of 100-300 pc in star-forming discs. Future work should characterise the multi-scale physics and
mass flows driving these lifecycles.
