The detection of the first electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational-wave signal in August
2017 marked the start of a new era of multi-messenger astrophysics. An unprecedented number of telescopes
around the world were involved in hunting for the source of the signal, and although more gravitational-wave
signals have been since detected, no further electromagnetic counterparts have been found. In
this thesis, I present my work to help build a telescope dedicated to the hunt for these elusive sources:
the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO). I detail the creation of the GOTO Telescope
Control System, G-TeCS, which includes the software required to control multiple wide-field telescopes
on a single robotic mount. G-TeCS also includes software that enables the telescope to complete
a sky survey and transient alert follow-up observations completely autonomously, whilst monitoring
the weather conditions and automatically fixing any hardware issues that arise. I go on to describe
the routines used to determine target priorities, as well as how the all-sky survey grid is defined,
how gravitational-wave and other transient alerts are received and processed, and how the optimum
follow-up strategies for these events were determined. The GOTO prototype, situated on La Palma,
saw first light in June 2017. I detail the work I carried out on the site to help commission the prototype,
and how the control software was developed during the commissioning phase. I also analyse the GOTO
CCD cameras and optics, building a complete theoretical model of the system to confirm the performance
of the prototype. Finally, I describe the results of simulations I carried out predicting the future
of the GOTO project, with multiple robotic telescopes on La Palma and in Australia, and how G-TeCS
might be modified to operate these telescopes as a single, global observatory.
