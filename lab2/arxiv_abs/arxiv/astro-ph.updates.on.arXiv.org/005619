We present the 1-100 GeV spectral energy distribution for a population of 148 high-synchrotron-peaked
blazars (HSPs) recently detected with Fermi-LAT as part of the First Brazil-ICRANet Gamma-ray
Blazar catalogue (1BIGB). Most of the 1BIGB sources do not appear in previous Fermi-LAT catalogues
and their gamma-ray spectral properties are presented here for the first time, representing a significant
new extension of the gamma-ray blazar population. Since our sample was originally selected from
an excess signal in the 0.3-500 GeV band, the sources stand out as promising TeV blazar candidates,
potentially in reach of the forthcoming very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray observatory, CTA. The
flux estimates presented here are derived considering PASS8 data, integrating over more than 9
years of Fermi-LAT observations. We also review the full broadband fit between 0.3-500 GeV presented
in the original 1BIGB paper for all sources, updating the power-law parameters with currently available
Fermi-LAT dataset. The importance of these sources in the context of VHE population studies with
both current instruments and the future CTA is evaluated. To do so, we select a subsample of 1BIGB
sources and extrapolate their gamma-ray SEDs to the highest energies, properly accounting for
absorption due to the extragalactic background light. We compare those extrapolations to the published
CTA sensitivity curves and estimate their detectability by CTA. Two notable sources from our sample,
namely 1BIGB J224910.6-130002 and 1BIGB J194356.2+211821, are discussed in greater detail. All
gamma-ray SEDs, which are shown here for the first time, are made publicly available via the Brazilian
Science Data Center (BSDC) service, maintained at CBPF, in Rio de Janeiro.
