The structure of the coronal magnetic field prior to eruptive processes and the conditions for the
onset of eruption are important issues that can be addressed through studying the magnetohydrodynamic
stability and evolution of nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) models. This paper uses data-constrained
NLFFF models of a solar active region that erupted on 2010 April~8 as initial condition in MHD simulations.
These models, constructed with the techniques of flux rope insertion and magnetofrictional relaxation,
include a stable, an approximately marginally stable, and an unstable configuration. The simulations
confirm previous related results of magnetofrictional relaxation runs, in particular that stable
flux rope equilibria represent key features of the observed pre-eruption coronal structure very
well and that there is a limiting value of the axial flux in the rope for the existence of stable NLFFF
equilibria. The specific limiting value is located within a tighter range, due to the sharper discrimination
between stability and instability by the MHD description. The MHD treatment of the eruptive configuration
yields very good agreement with a number of observed features like the strongly inclined initial
rise path and the close temporal association between the coronal mass ejection and the onset of flare
reconnection. Minor differences occur in the velocity of flare ribbon expansion and in the further
evolution of the inclination; these can be eliminated through refined simulations. We suggest
that the slingshot effect of horizontally bent flux in the source region of eruptions can contribute
significantly to the inclination of the rise direction. Finally, we demonstrate that the onset
criterion formulated in terms of a threshold value for the axial flux in the rope corresponds very
well to the threshold of the torus instability in the considered active region.
