We utilise the final catalogue from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey to investigate the
links between the globular cluster system and field halo in M31 at projected radii $R_p=25-150$
kpc. In this region the cluster surface density profile exhibits a power-law decline with index
$\Gamma=-2.37\pm0.17$, matching that for the metal-poor stellar halo component with [Fe/H] $<-1.1$.
Spatial density maps reveal a striking correspondence between the most luminous substructures
in the metal-poor field halo and the positions of many clusters. By calculating the surface density
of metal-poor halo stars in the vicinity of each globular cluster and comparing to the azimuthal
distribution at commensurate radius, we reject the possibility of no correlation between clusters
and field overdensities with high confidence. In contrast, we find no evidence for a similar association
between clusters and metal-rich features ([Fe/H] $>-1.1$) even though this component contains
the dominant fraction ($>70\%$) of the halo luminosity. Our data reveal that $\approx35-60\%$
of clusters exhibit properties consistent with having been accreted into the outskirts of M31 at
late times with their now-defunct parent dwarfs. Conversely, at least $\sim40\%$ of remote clusters
show no evidence for a link with halo substructure. The radial density profile for this subgroup
is featureless and has a power-law index $\Gamma=-2.15\pm0.05$, identical to that observed for
the apparently smooth component of the metal-poor stellar halo. We speculate that these clusters
are associated with the smooth halo; if so, their properties support a scenario where the smooth
halo was built up at early times via the destruction of primitive satellites. In this picture the
entire M31 globular cluster system outside $R_p=25$ kpc is comprised of objects accumulated from
external galaxies over a Hubble time of growth.
