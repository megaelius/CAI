We discuss candidates for non-radial modes excited in a mass accreting and rapidly rotating neutron
star to explain the coherent frequency identified in the light curves of a millisecond X-ray pulsar
XTE J1751-305. The spin frequency of the pulsar is $\nu_{\rm spin}\cong435$Hz and the identified
coherent frequency is $\nu_{\rm osc}=0.5727595\times\nu_{\rm spin}$. Assuming the frequency
identified is that observed in the corotating frame of the neutron star, we find that the surface
$r$-modes of $l^\prime=m=1$ and 2 excited by $\epsilon$-mechanism due to helium burning in the
thin shell can give the frequency ratio $\kappa=\nu_{\rm osc}/\nu_{\rm spin}\simeq0.57$ at $\nu_{\rm
spin}=435$Hz. As another candidate for the observed ratio $\kappa$, we also suggest a toroidal
crustal mode that has penetrating amplitudes in the fluid core and is destabilized by gravitational
wave emission. Since the surface fluid layer is separated from the fluid core by a solid crust, the
amplitudes of an $r$-mode in the core, which is destabilized by emitting gravitational waves, can
be by a large factor different from those in the fluid ocean. We find that the amplification factor
defined as $f_{\rm amp}=\alpha_{\rm surface}/\alpha_{\rm core}$ is as large as $f_{\rm amp}\sim
10^2$ for the $l^\prime=m=2$ $r$-mode at $\nu_{\rm spin}=435$Hz for a $M=1.4M_\odot$ neutron
star model. Because of this significant amplification of the $r$-mode amplitudes in the surface
fluid layer, we suggest that, when proper corrections to the $r$-mode frequency such as due to the
general relativistic effects are taken into consideration, the core $r$-mode of $l^\prime=m=2$
can be a candidate for the detected frequency, without leading to serious contradictions to, for
example, the spin evolution of the underlying neutron star.
