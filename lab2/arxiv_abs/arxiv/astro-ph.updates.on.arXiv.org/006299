We present the Mass Assembly of Stellar Systems and their Evolution with the SMA (MASSES) survey,
which uses the Submillimeter Array (SMA) interferometer to map the continuum and molecular lines
for all 74 known Class 0/I protostellar systems in the Perseus molecular cloud. The primary goal
of the survey is to observe an unbiased sample of young protostars in a single molecular cloud so that
we can characterize the evolution of protostars. This paper releases the MASSES 1.3 mm data from
the subcompact configuration ($\sim$4$^{\prime\prime}$ or $\sim$1000 au resolution), which
is the SMA's most compact array configuration. We release both $uv$ visibility data and imaged data
for the spectral lines CO(2-1),$^{13}$CO(2-1), C$^{18}$O(2-1), and N$_2$D$^+$(3-2), as well
as for the 1.3 mm continuum. We identify the tracers that are detected toward each source. We also
show example images of continuum and CO(2-1) outflows, analyze C$^{18}$O(2-1) spectra, and present
data from the SVS 13 star-forming region. The calculated envelope masses from the continuum show
a decreasing trend with bolometric temperature (a proxy for age). Typical C$^{18}$O(2-1) linewidths
are 1.45 km s$^{-1}$, which is higher than the C$^{18}$O linewidths detected toward Perseus filaments
and cores. We find that N$_2$D$^+$(3-2) is significantly more likely to be detected toward younger
protostars. We show that the protostars in SVS 13 are contained within filamentary structures as
traced by C$^{18}$O(2-1) and N$_2$D$^+$(3-2). We also present the locations of SVS 13A's high velocity
(absolute line-of-sight velocities $>$150 km s$^{-1}$) red and blue outflow components. Data
