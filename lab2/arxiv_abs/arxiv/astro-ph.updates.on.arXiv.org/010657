Full-disc Ca II K photographic observations of the Sun carry direct information about the evolution
of solar-plage regions for more than a century and are therefore a unique dataset for solar-activity
studies. For a long time Ca II K observations were barely explored, but recent digitisations of multiple
archives have allowed their extensive analysis. However, various studies have reported diverse
results partly due to the insufficient quality of the digitised data. Furthermore, inhomogeneities
have been identified within the individual archives, which, at least partly, could be due to the
digitisation. As a result, some of the archives, e.g. that from the Kodaikanal observatory, were
re-digitised. The results obtained by different authors who analysed the data from the new digitisation
of the Kodaikanal archive differ from each other as well as from those derived from the old digitisation.
Since the data were processed and analysed using different techniques, it is not clear, however,
whether the differences are due to the digitisation or the processing of the data. To understand
the reasons for such discrepancies, we analyse here the data from the two most recent digitisations
of this archive. We use the same techniques to consistently process the images from both archives
and to derive the plage areas from them. Some issues have been identified in both digitisations,
implying that they are intrinsic characteristics of the data. Moreover, errors in timing of the
observations plague both digitisations. Overall, the most recent 16-bit digitisation offers
an improvement over the earlier 8-bit one. It also includes considerably more data and should be
preferred.
