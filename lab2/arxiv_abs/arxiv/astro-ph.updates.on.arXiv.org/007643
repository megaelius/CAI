As a young massive cluster in the Central Molecular Zone, the Arches cluster is a valuable probe of
the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) in the extreme Galactic Center environment. We use multi-epoch
Hubble Space Telescope observations to obtain high-precision proper motion and photometric measurements
of the cluster, calculating cluster membership probabilities for stars down to 1.8 M$_{\odot}$
between cluster radii of 0.25 pc -- 3.0 pc. We achieve a cluster sample with just ~8% field contamination,
a significant improvement over photometrically-selected samples which are severely compromised
by the differential extinction across the field. Combining this sample with K-band spectroscopy
of 5 cluster members, we forward model the Arches cluster to simultaneously constrain its IMF and
other properties (such as age and total mass) while accounting for observational uncertainties,
completeness, mass segregation, and stellar multiplicity. We find that the Arches IMF is best described
by a 1-segment power law that is significantly top-heavy: $\alpha$ = 1.80 $\pm$ 0.05 (stat) $\pm$
0.06 (sys), where dN/dm $\propto$ m$^{-\alpha}$, though we cannot discount a 2-segment power law
model with a high-mass slope only slightly shallower than local star forming regions ($\alpha$
= 2.04$^{+0.14}_{-0.19}$ $\pm$ 0.04) but with a break at 5.8$^{+3.2}_{-1.2}$ $\pm$ 0.02 M$_{\odot}$.
In either case, the Arches IMF is significantly different than the standard IMF. Comparing the Arches
to other young massive clusters in the Milky Way, we find tentative evidence for a systematically
top-heavy IMF at the Galactic Center.
