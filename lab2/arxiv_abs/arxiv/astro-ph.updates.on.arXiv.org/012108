The detection of GW170817 in gravitational waves and gamma rays revealed that short gamma-ray bursts
are associated with the merger of neutron-stars. Gamma rays are thought to result from the formation
of collimated jets, but the details of this process continue to elude us. One fundamental observable
is the emission profile of the jet as a function of viewing angle. We present two methods to measure
the effective angular width, $\theta_B$, of short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) jets using gravitational
wave and gamma-ray data, assuming all sGRBs have the same angular dependence for their luminosities.
The first is a counting experiment, where we combine the known detection thresholds of the LIGO/Virgo
and Fermi Gamma Ray Burst Monitor detectors to infer parameters of systems that are detected in gravitational
waves. This method requires minimal knowledge about each event, beyond whether or not they were
detected in gamma-rays. The second method uses additional information from the gravitational-wave
and electromagnetic data to estimate parameters of the source, and thereby improve constraints
on jet properties. Applying our methods to GW170817, we find only weak constraints on the sGRB luminosity
profile, with statistical uncertainty dominating differences between models. We also analyze
simulated events from future observing runs, and find that with 5 and 100 BNS detections, the counting
method constrains the relative uncertainty in $\theta_B$ to within 51% and 12%, respectively.
Incorporating gravitational-wave parameter estimation would further tighten these constraints
to 43% and 9.6%. In the limit of many detections, incorporating parameter estimation achieves only
marginal improvements; we conclude that the majority of the information about jet structure comes
from the relative sensitivities of gravitational-wave and gamma-ray detectors as encoded in simple
counting experiments.
