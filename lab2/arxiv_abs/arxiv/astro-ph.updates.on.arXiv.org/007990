We present new observations of the edge-on debris disk around HD 15115 (F star at 48.2 pc) obtained
in the near IR. We search for observational evidence for a second inner planetesimal ring in the system.
We obtained total intensity and polarimetric data in the broadbands J and H and processed the data
with differential imaging techniques achieving an angular resolution of about 40 mas. We observe
an axisymmetric planetesimal belt with a radius of $\sim$2$''$, an inclination of $85.8^{\circ}
\pm 0.7^{\circ}$ and position angle of 278.9$^{\circ} \pm 0.1^{\circ}$. A grid of models describing
the spatial distribution of the grains in the disk is generated to constrain the geometric parameters
of the disk and to explore the presence of a second belt. We perform a photometric analysis of the data
and compare disk brightness in two bands in scattered and in polarized light. The analysis shows
that the west side is $\sim$2.5 times brighter in total intensity than the east side in both bands,
while for polarized light in the J band this ratio is only 1.25. The maximum polarization fraction
is 15--20% at $r\sim$2.5$''$. We also find that the J - H color of the disk appears to be red for the radial
separations $r\lesssim2''$ and it is getting bluer for the larger separations. This apparent change
of disk color from red to blue with an increasing radial separation could be explained by the decreasing
average grain size with a distance. The presence of an additional inner belt slighly inclined with
respect to the main planetesimal belt is suspected from the polarized intensity image but the analysis
and modeling presented here cannot establish a firm conclusion due to the faintness of the disk and
its high inclination.
