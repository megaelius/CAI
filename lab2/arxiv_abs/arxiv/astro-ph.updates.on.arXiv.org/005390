NGC 253 hosts the nearest bar-fed nuclear starburst. Previous observations show a region rich in
molecular gas, with dense clouds and clumps associated with recent star formation. We used ALMA
to image the 350 GHz dust continuum and molecular line emission from this region at 2 pc resolution.
Our observations reveal 14 bright, compact (~2-3 pc FWHM) knots of dust emission. We argue that most
of these sources are likely to be forming super star clusters (SSCs) based on their inferred dynamical
and gas masses, association with 36 GHz radio continuum emission, and coincidence with line emission
tracing dense, excited gas. One source coincides with a known SSC, but the rest remain largely invisible
in Hubble near-IR imaging. Our observations show the presence of dense, highly-excited gas in these
objects and imply that gas still makes up a large fraction of their overall mass. The high brightness
temperature of the sources even at 350 GHz implies a large optical depth near the peak of the infrared
(IR) SED. This suggests that these sources may have large IR photospheres and that the IR radiation
force likely exceeds L/c. Still, their moderate observed velocity dispersions suggest that feedback
from radiation, winds, and supernovae are not yet disrupting most sources. Several lines of argument
suggest that this mode of star formation may produce most of the stars in the burst. We argue for a scenario
in which this phase lasts ~1 Myr, after which the clusters shed their natal cocoons but continue to
produce ionizing photons and starlight. The strong feedback that drives the observed cold gas and
X-ray outflows then likely occurs after the clusters emerge from this early phase.
