We evaluated the effectiveness of different indicators of cluster virialization using 12 large-scale
structures in the ORELSE survey spanning from $0.7<z<1.3$. We located diffuse X-ray emission from
16 galaxy clusters using Chandra observations. We studied the properties of these clusters and
their members, using Chandra data in conjunction with optical and near-IR imaging and spectroscopy.
We measured X-ray luminosities and gas temperatures of each cluster, as well as velocity dispersions
of their member galaxies. We compared these results to scaling relations derived from virialized
clusters, finding significant offsets of up to 3-4$\sigma$ for some clusters, which could indicate
they are disturbed or still forming. We explored if other properties of the clusters correlated
with these offsets by performing a set of tests of virialization and substructure on our sample,
including Dressler-Schectman tests, power ratios, analyses of the velocity distributions of
galaxy populations, and centroiding differences. For comparison to a wide range of studies, we
used two sets of tests: ones that did and did not use spectral energy distribution fitting to obtain
rest-frame colours, stellar masses, and photometric redshifts of galaxies. Our results indicated
that the difference between the stellar mass or light mean-weighted center and the X-ray center,
as well as the projected offset of the most-massive/brightest cluster galaxy from other cluster
centroids had the strongest correlations with scaling relation offsets, implying they are the
most robust indicators of cluster virialization and can be used for this purpose when X-ray data
is insufficiently deep for reliable $L_X$ and $T_X$ measurements.
