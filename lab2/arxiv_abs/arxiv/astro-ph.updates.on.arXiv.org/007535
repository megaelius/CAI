We aim to reveal the physical properties and chemical composition of the cores in the California
molecular cloud (CMC), so as to better understand the initial conditions of star formation. We made
a high-resolution column density map (18.2") with Herschel data, and extracted a complete sample
of the cores in the CMC with the \textsl{fellwalker} algorithm. We performed new single-pointing
observations of molecular lines near 90 GHz with the IRAM 30m telescope along the main filament of
the CMC. In addition, we also performed a numerical modeling of chemical evolution for the cores
under the physical conditions. We extracted 300 cores, of which 33 are protostellar and 267 are starless
cores. About 51\% (137 of 267) of the starless cores are prestellar cores. Three cores have the potential
to evolve into high-mass stars. The prestellar core mass function (CMF) can be well fit by a log-normal
form. The high-mass end of the prestellar CMF shows a power-law form with an index $\alpha=-0.9\pm
0.1$ that is shallower than that of the Galactic field stellar mass function. Combining the mass
transformation efficiency ($\varepsilon$) from the prestellar core to the star of $15\pm 1\%$
and the core formation efficiency (CFE) of 5.5\%, we suggest an overall star formation efficiency
of about 1\% in the CMC. In the single-pointing observations with the IRAM 30m telescope, we find
that 6 cores show blue-skewed profile, while 4 cores show red-skewed profile. [$\rm {HCO}^{+}$]/[HNC]
and [$\rm {HCO}^{+}$]/$\rm [N_{2}H^{+}]$ in protostellar cores are higher than those in prestellar
cores; this can be used as chemical clocks. The best-fit chemical age of the cores with line observations
is $\sim 5\times 10^4$~years.
