Directional statistical analyses, using the variance momentum, on the four foreground-cleaned
Planck maps evidence a net dipolar distribution pointing in the direction (l,b) $\sim$ (245$^\circ$,-35$^\circ$),
consistent with the direction of the North-South asymmetry phenomenon. Although the magnitude
of this variance dipole is not statistically significant, $\sim$ 85% CL, as compared with maps produced
with similar directional analysis, it evidences interesting attributes. First, Planck's variance
dipole - magnitude and direction - appears robust against the four different component separation
algorithms (employed to clean contaminants in Planck data), various Planck masks, map's pixelization
parameters, and the addition of inhomogeneous real noise. Moreover, Planck's variance dipole
magnitude has a curious behavior: it gets lower values for larger sky-cut masks, independent of
the map analyzed, strongly suggesting two causes: either foreground remnants that diminishe their
influence when severe masks are used or CMB power from the quadrupole-octopole alignment whose
larger influence is cut off in the region where the masks act. Extra analyses were performed here
to elucidate this point. From one side, we show that Planck's variance dipole is robust in magnitude
and direction against fre- quency dependence, disfavoring the foreground residuals as an explanation.
From the other side, we shuffle Planck's quadrupole and octopole components, leaving their magnitudes
intact: the result was a variance dipole with half of its original magnitude pointing in a different
direction, showing that these CMB multipoles have a definitive effect on the Planck's variance
dipolar distri- bution. Albeit the foreground residuals can not be excluded altogether, our analyses
suggest that the main reason for this variance dipole is the CMB quadrupole-octopole alignment
phenomenon.
