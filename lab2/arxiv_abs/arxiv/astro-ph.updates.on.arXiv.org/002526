We apply the convolved Lagrangian perturbation theory (CLPT) formalism, in which one can express
the matter density power spectrum in terms of integrals over a function of cumulants of the displacement
field, allowing for a resummation of the terms, to evaluate the full one loop power spectrum. We keep
the cumulants up to third order, extending the Zel'dovich approximation and providing the power
spectrum analogous to the calculations recently performed for the correlation function. We compare
the results to the N-body simulations and to the Lagrangian perturbation simulations up to the second
order. We find that the analytic calculations are in a good agreement with the LPT simulations, but
when compared to full N-body simulations, we find that while one loop calculations improve upon
the Zel'dovich approximation in the power spectrum, they still significantly lack power. As found
previously in the correlation function one loop CLPT improves slightly against Zel'dovich above
30Mpc/h, but is actually worse than Zel'dovich below that. We investigate the deficiencies of the
CLPT approach and argue that main problem of CLPT is its inability to trap particles inside dark matter
halos, which leads to an overestimate of the small scale power of the displacement field and to an
underestimate of the small scale power from one halo term effects. We model this using the displacement
field damped at a nonlinear scale (CLPTs). To explore this in more detail we decompose the power spectrum
and correlation function into three additive components: Zel'dovich, residual BAO wiggle, and
residual broad band. One loop CLPT predicts small modifications to BAO wiggles that are enhanced
in CLPTs, with up to 5\% corrections to correlation function around BAO scale.
