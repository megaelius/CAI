High-resolution ($<$0.1pc) ALMA observations of the 30Dor-10 molecular cloud 15pc north of R136
are presented. The $^{12}$CO 2-1 emission morphology contains clumps near the locations of known
mid-infrared massive protostars, as well as a series of parsec-long filaments oriented almost
directly towards R136. There is elevated kinetic energy (linewidths at a given size scale) in 30Dor-10
compared to other LMC and Galactic star formation regions, consistent with large scale energy injection
to the region. Analysis of the cloud substructures is performed by segmenting emission into disjoint
approximately round "cores" using clumpfind, by considering the hierarchical structures defined
by isointensity contours using dendrograms, and by segmenting into disjoint long thin "filaments"
using Filfinder. Identified filaments have widths $\sim$0.1pc. The inferred balance between
gravity and kinematic motions depends on the segmentation method: Entire objects identified with
clumpfind are consistent with free-fall collapse or virial equilibrium with moderate external
pressure, whereas many dendrogram-identified parts of hierarchical structures have higher mass
surface densities $\Sigma_{LTE}$ than if gravitational and kinetic energies were in balance.
Filaments have line masses that vary widely compared to the critical line mass calculated assuming
thermal and nonthermal support. Velocity gradients in the region do not show any strong evidence
for accretion of mass along filaments. The upper end of the "core" mass distribution is consistent
with a power-law with the same slope as the stellar initial mass function.
