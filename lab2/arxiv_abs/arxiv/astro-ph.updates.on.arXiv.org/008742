A suite of 432 collisionless simulations of bound pairs of spiral galaxies with mass ratios 1:1 and
3:1, and global properties consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, is used to test the conjecture
that major mergers fuel the dual AGN (DAGN) of the local volume. Our analysis is based on the premise
that the essential aspects of this scenario can be captured by replacing the physics of the central
BH with restrictions on their relative separation in phase space. We introduce several estimates
of the DAGN fraction and infer predictions for the activity levels and resolution limits usually
involved in surveys of these systems, assessing their dependence on the parameters controlling
the length of both mergers and nuclear activity. Given a set of constraints, we find that the values
adopted for some of the latter factors often condition the outcomes from individual experiments.
Still, the results do not reveal, in general, very tight correlations, being the tendency of the
frequencies normalized to the merger time to anticorrelate with the orbital circularity the clearest
effect. In agreement with other theoretical studies, our simulations predict intrinsic abundances
of these systems that range from $\sim$few to $15\%$ depending on the maximum level of nuclear activity
achieved. At the same time, we show that these probabilities are reduced by about an order of magnitude
when they are filtered with the typical constraints applied by observational studies of the DAGN
fraction at low redshift. As a whole, the results of the present work prove that the consideration
of the most common limitations involved in the detection of close active pairs at optical wavelengths
is sufficient by itself to reconcile the intrinsic frequencies envisaged in a hierarchical universe
with the small fractions of double-peaked narrow-line systems which are often reported at kpc-scales.
