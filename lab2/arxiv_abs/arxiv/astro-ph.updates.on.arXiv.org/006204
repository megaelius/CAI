We study the birth of supermassive black holes from the direct collapse process and characterize
the sites where these black hole seeds form. In the pre-reionization epoch, molecular hydrogen
(H$_2$) is an efficient coolant, causing gas to fragment and form Population III stars, but Lyman-Werner
radiation can suppress H$_2$ formation and allow gas to collapse directly into a massive black hole.
The critical flux required to inhibit H$_2$ formation, $J_{\rm crit}$, is hotly debated, largely
due to the uncertainties in the source radiation spectrum, H$_2$ self-shielding, and collisional
dissociation rates. Here, we test the power of the direct collapse model in a self-consistent, time-dependant,
non-uniform Lyman-Werner radiation field -- the first time such has been done in a cosmological
volume -- using an updated version of the SPH+N-body tree code Gasoline with H$_2$ non-equilibrium
abundance tracking, H$_2$ cooling, and a modern SPH implementation. We vary $J_{\rm crit} $ from
$30$ to $10^3$ in units of $J_{21}$ to study how this parameter impacts the number of seed black holes
and the type of galaxies which host them. We focus on black hole formation as a function of environment,
halo mass, metallicity, and proximity of the Lyman-Werner source. Massive black hole seeds form
more abundantly with lower $J_{\rm crit}$ thresholds, but regardless of $J_{\rm crit}$, these
seeds typically form in halos that have recently begun star formation. Our results do not confirm
the proposed atomic cooling halo pair scenario; rather black hole seeds predominantly form in low-metallicity
pockets of halos which already host star formation.
