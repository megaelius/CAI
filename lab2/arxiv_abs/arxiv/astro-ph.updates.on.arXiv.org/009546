Ellerman bombs and UV bursts are transient brightenings that are ubiquitously observed in the lower
atmospheres of active and emerging flux regions. Here we present inversion results of SST/CRISP
and CHROMIS, as well as IRIS data of such transient events. Combining information from the Mg II h
& k, Si IV and Ca II 8542A and Ca II H & K lines, we aim to characterise their temperature and velocity
stratification, as well as their magnetic field configuration. We find average temperature enhancements
of a few thousand kelvin close to the classical temperature minimum, but localised peak temperatures
of up to 10,000-15,000 K from Ca II inversions. Including Mg II generally dampens these temperature
enhancements to below 8000 K, while Si IV requires temperatures in excess of 10,000 K at low heights,
but may also be reproduced with secondary temperature enhancements of 35,000-60,000 K higher up.
However, reproducing Si IV comes at the expense of overestimating the Mg II emission. The line-of-sight
velocity maps show clear bi-directional jet signatures and strong correlation with substructure
in the intensity images, with slightly larger velocities towards the observer than away. The magnetic
field parameters show an enhancement of the horizontal field co-located with the brightenings
at similar heights as the temperature increase. We are thus able to largely reproduce the observational
properties of Ellerman bombs with UV burst signature with temperature stratifications peaking
close to the classical temperature minimum. Correctly modelling the Si IV emission in agreement
with all other diagnostics is, however, an outstanding issue. Accounting for resolution differences,
fitting localised temperature enhancements and/or performing spatially-coupled inversions
is likely necessary to obtain better agreement between all considered diagnostics.
