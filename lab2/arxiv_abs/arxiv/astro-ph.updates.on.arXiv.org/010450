This paper presents a case study of microbe transportation in the Mars-satellites system. We examined
the spatial distribution of potential impact-transported microbes on the Martian moons using
impact physics by following a companion study (Fujita et al.). We used sterilization data from the
precede studies. We considered that the microbes came mainly from the Zunil crater on Mars. We found
that 70-80% of the microbes are likely to be dispersed all over the moon surface and are rapidly sterilized
due to radiation except for those microbes within a thick ejecta deposit produced by meteoroids.
The other 20-30% might be shielded from radiation by thick regolith layers that formed at collapsed
layers in craters produced by Mars rock impacts. The total number of potentially surviving microbes
at the thick ejecta deposits is estimated to be 3-4 orders of magnitude lower than at the Mars rock
craters. The microbe concentration is irregular in the horizontal direction and is largely depth-dependent
due to the radiation sterilization. The surviving fraction of transported microbes would be only
1 ppm on Phobos and 100 ppm on Deimos, suggesting that the transport processes and radiation severely
affect microbe survival. The microbe sampling probability from the Martian moons was also investigated.
We suggest that sample return missions from the Martian moons are classified into Unrestricted
Earth-Return missions for 30 g samples and 10 cm depth sampling, even in our conservative scenario.
We also conducted a full statistical analysis for sampling the regolith of Phobos to include the
effects of uncertainties in input parameters on the sampling probability. The most likely probability
of microbial contamination for return samples is estimated to be two orders of magnitude lower than
the criterion defined by the planetary protection policy of the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR).
