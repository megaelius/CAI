The formation of planets in compact or highly eccentric binaries and the migration of hot Jupiters
are two outstanding problems in planet formation. The hot Jupiter $\tau$ Boo Ab orbits the primary
star in the long-period ($P \gtrsim 1000\,$yr), highly eccentric ($e \sim 0.9$) binary $\tau$ Bo\"otis.
Due to the long orbital period, the orbit of the stellar binary is poorly constrained. Here we aim
to constrain the orbit of the stellar binary $\tau$ Boo AB in order to investigate the formation and
migration history of the system. The mutual orbital inclination of the stellar companion and the
hot Jupiter has important implications for planet migration. The binary eccentricity and periastron
distance are important for understanding the conditions under which $\tau$ Boo Ab formed. We combine
more than 150 years of astrometric data with twenty-five years of high precision radial velocities.
The combination of sky-projected and line-of-sight measurements places tight constraints on
the orbital inclination, eccentricity, and periastron distance of $\tau$ Boo AB. We find an orbital
inclination of $47.2^{+2.7}_{-3.7}\,$deg, periastron distance of $28.3^{+2.3}_{-3.0}\,$au
and eccentricity of $0.87^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$. We find that the orbital inclinations of $\tau$ Boo
Ab and $\tau$ Boo B, as well as the stellar spin-axis of $\tau$ Boo A coincide at $\sim \! 45$ degrees,
a result consistent with the assumption of a well-aligned, coplanar system. The likely aligned,
coplanar configuration suggests planetary migration within a well-aligned protoplanetary disc.
Due to the high eccentricity and small periastron distance of $\tau$ Boo B, the protoplanetary disc
was tidally truncated at $\approx \! 6\,$au. We suggest that $\tau$ Boo Ab formed near the edge of
the truncated disc and migrated inwards with high eccentricity due to spiral waves generated by
the stellar companion.
