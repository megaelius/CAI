We explore the physics of relativistic radiation mediated shocks (RRMSs) in the regime where photon
advection dominates over photon generation. For this purpose, a novel iterative method for deriving
a self-consistent steady-state structure of RRMS is developed, based on a Monte-Carlo code that
solves the transfer of photons subject to Compton scattering and pair production/annihilation.
Systematic study is performed by imposing various upstream conditions which are characterized
by the following three parameters: the photon-to-baryon inertia ratio $\xi_{u *}$, the photon-to-baryon
number ratio $\tilde{n}$, and the shock Lorentz factor $\gamma_u$. We find that the properties
of RRMSs vary considerably with these parameters. In particular, while a smooth decline in the velocity,
accompanied by a gradual temperature increase is seen for $\xi_{u*} \gg 1$, an efficient bulk Comptonization,
that leads to a heating precursor, is found for $\xi_{u*} \lesssim 1$. As a consequence, although
particle acceleration is highly inefficient in these shocks, a broad non-thermal spectrum is produced
in the latter case. The generation of high energy photons through bulk Comptonization leads, in
certain cases, to a copious production of pairs that provide the dominant opacity for Compton scattering.
We also find that for certain upstream conditions a weak subshock appears within the flow. For a choice
of parameters suitable to gamma-ray bursts, the radiation spectrum within the shock is found to
be compatible with that of the prompt emission, suggesting that subphotospheric shocks may give
rise to the observed non-thermal features despite the absence of accelerated particles.
