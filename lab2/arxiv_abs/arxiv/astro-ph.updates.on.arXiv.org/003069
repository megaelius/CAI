Context: In the past decade, sensitive, resolved Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) studies of galaxy clusters
have become common. Whereas many previous SZ studies have parameterized the pressure profiles
of galaxy clusters, non-parametric reconstructions will provide insights into the thermodynamic
state of the intracluster medium (ICM). Aims: We seek to recover the non-parametric pressure profiles
of the high redshift ($z=0.89$) galaxy cluster CLJ 1226.9+3332 as inferred from SZ data from the
MUSTANG, NIKA, Bolocam, and Planck instruments, which all probe different angular scales. Methods:
Our non-parametric algorithm makes use of logarithmic interpolation, which under the assumption
of ellipsoidal symmetry is analytically integrable. For MUSTANG, NIKA, and Bolocam we derive a
non-parametric pressure profile independently and find good agreement among the instruments.
In particular, we find that the non-parametric profiles are consistent with a fitted gNFW profile.
Given the ability of Planck to constrain the total signal, we include a prior on the integrated Compton
Y parameter as determined by Planck. Results: For a given instrument, constraints on the pressure
profile diminish rapidly beyond the field of view. The overlap in spatial scales probed by these
four datasets is therefore critical in checking for consistency between instruments. By using
multiple instruments, our analysis of CLJ 1226.9+3332 covers a large radial range, from the central
regions to the cluster outskirts: $0.05 R_{500} < r < 1.1 R_{500}$. This is a wider range of spatial
scales than is typical recovered by SZ instruments. Similar analyses will be possible with the new
generation of SZ instruments such as NIKA2 and MUSTANG2.
