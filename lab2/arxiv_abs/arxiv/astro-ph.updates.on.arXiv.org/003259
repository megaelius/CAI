We present spectroscopic follow-up of candidate luminous Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z=5.7-6.6$
in the SA22 field with VLT/X-SHOOTER. We confirm two new luminous LAEs at $z=5.676$ (SR6) and $z=6.532$
(VR7), and also present {\it HST} follow-up of both sources. These sources have luminosities L$_{\rm
Ly\alpha} \approx 3\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, very high rest-frame equivalent widths of EW$_0\gtrsim
200$ {\AA} and narrow Ly$\alpha$ lines (200-340 km s$^{-1}$). VR7 is the most UV-luminous LAE at
$z>6.5$, with M$_{1500} = -22.5$, even brighter in the UV than CR7. Besides Ly$\alpha$, we do not
detect any other rest-frame UV lines in the spectra of SR6 and VR7, and argue that rest-frame UV lines
are easier to observe in bright galaxies with low Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths. We confirm that
Ly$\alpha$ line-widths increase with Ly$\alpha$ luminosity at $z=5.7$, while there are indications
that Ly$\alpha$ lines of faint LAEs become broader at $z=6.6$, potentially due to reionisation.
We find a large spread of up to 3 dex in UV luminosity for $>L^{\star}$ LAEs, but find that the Ly$\alpha$
luminosity of the brightest LAEs is strongly related to UV luminosity at $z=6.6$. Under basic assumptions,
we find that several LAEs at $z\approx6-7$ have Ly$\alpha$ escape fractions $\gtrsim100$ \%, indicating
bursty star-formation histories, alternative Ly$\alpha$ production mechanisms, or dust attenuating
Ly$\alpha$ emission differently than UV emission. Finally, we present a method to compute $\xi_{ion}$,
the production efficiency of ionising photons, and find that LAEs at $z\approx6-7$ have high values
of log$_{10}(\xi_{ion}$/Hz erg$^{-1}) \approx 25.51\pm0.09$ that may alleviate the need for
high Lyman-Continuum escape fractions required for reionisation.
