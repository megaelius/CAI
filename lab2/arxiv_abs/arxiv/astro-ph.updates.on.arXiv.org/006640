Studying the gravitational-wave sky with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) is a key science goal for the
Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and its pathfinder telescopes. With current PTAs reaching sub-microsecond
timing precision, making accurate measurements of interstellar propagation effects and mitigating
them effectively has become increasingly important to realise PTA goals. As these effects are much
stronger at longer wavelengths, low-frequency observations are most appealing for characterizing
the interstellar medium (ISM) along the sight lines toward PTA pulsars. The Murchison Widefield
Array (MWA) and the Engineering Development Array (EDA), which utilizes MWA technologies, present
promising opportunities for undertaking such studies, particularly for PTA pulsars located in
the southern sky. Such pulsars are also the prime targets for PTA efforts planned with the South African
MeerKAT, and eventually with the SKA. In this paper we report on observations of two bright southern
millisecond pulsars PSRs J0437-4715 and J2145-0750 made with these facilities; MWA observations
sampling multiple frequencies across the 80-250 MHz frequency range, while the EDA providing direct-sampled
baseband data to yield a large instantaneous usable bandwidth of $\sim$200 MHz. Using these observations,
we investigate various aspects relating to pulsar emission and ISM properties, such as spectral
evolution of the mean pulse shape, scintillation as a function of frequency, chromaticity in interstellar
dispersion, and flux density spectra at low frequencies. Systematic and regular monitoring observations
will help ascertain the role of low-frequency measurements in PTA experiments, while simultaneously
providing a detailed characterization of the ISM toward the pulsars, which will be useful in devising
optimal observing strategies for future PTA experiments.
