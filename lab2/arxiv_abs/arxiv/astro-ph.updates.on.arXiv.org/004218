We present a new measurement of the Ly${\alpha}$ forest power spectrum at $1.8 < z < 3.4$ using 74 Keck/HIRES
and VLT/UVES high-resolution, high-S/N quasar spectra. We developed a custom pipeline to measure
the power spectrum and its uncertainty, which fully accounts for finite resolution and noise, and
corrects for the bias induced by masking missing data, DLAs, and metal absorption lines. Our measurement
results in unprecedented precision on the small-scale modes $k > 0.02\,\mathrm{s\,km^{-1}}$,
unaccessible to previous SDSS/BOSS analyses. It is well known that these high-$k$ modes are highly
sensitive to the thermal state of the intergalactic medium, however contamination by narrow metal
lines is a significant concern. We quantify the effect of metals on the small-scale power, and find
a modest effect on modes with $k < 0.1\,\mathrm{s\,km^{-1}} $. As a result, by masking metals and
restricting to $k < 0.1\,\mathrm{s\,km^{-1}}$ their impact is completely mitigated. We present
an end-to-end Bayesian forward modeling framework whereby mock spectra with the same noise, resolution,
and masking as our data are generated from Ly${\alpha}$ forest simulations. These mocks are used
to build a custom emulator, enabling us to interpolate between a sparse grid of models and perform
MCMC fits. Our results agree well with BOSS on scales $k < 0.02\,\mathrm{s\,km^{-1}}$ where the
measurements overlap. The combination of BOSS' percent level low-$k$ precision with our $5-15\%$
high-$k$ measurements, results in a powerful new dataset for precisely constraining the thermal
history of the intergalactic medium, cosmological parameters, and the nature of dark matter. The
power spectra and their covariance matrices are provided as electronic tables.
