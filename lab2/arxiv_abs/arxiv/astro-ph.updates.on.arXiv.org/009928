We report the discovery with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) of narrow emission
and absorption lines during photospheric radius expansion (PRE) X-ray bursts from the ultracompact
binary 4U 1820-30. NICER observed the source in 2017 August accumulating about 60 ks of exposure.
Five thermonuclear X-ray bursts were detected of which four showed clear signs of PRE. We extracted
spectra during the PRE phases and fit each to a model that includes a comptonized component to describe
the accretion-driven emission, and a black body for the burst thermal radiation. The temperature
and spherical emitting radius of the fitted black body are used to assess the strength of PRE in each
burst. The two strongest PRE bursts (burst pair 1) had black body temperatures of approximately
0.6 keV and emitting radii of 100 km (at a distance of 8.4 kpc). The other two bursts (burst pair 2) had
higher temperatures (~0.67 keV) and smaller radii (75 km). All of the PRE bursts show evidence of
narrow line emission near 1 keV. By co-adding the PRE phase spectra of burst pairs 1 and, separately,
2 we find, in both co-added spectra, significant, narrow, spectral features near 1.0 (emission),
1.7 and 3.0 keV (both in absorption). Remarkably, all the fitted line centroids in the co-added spectrum
of burst pair 1 appear systematically blue-shifted by a factor of $1.046 \pm 0.006$ compared to the
centroids of pair 2, strongly indicative of a gravitational red-shift, a wind-induced blue-shift,
or more likely some combination of both effects. The observed shifts are consistent with this scenario
in that the stronger PRE bursts in pair 1 reach larger photospheric radii, and thus have weaker gravitational
red-shifts, and they generate faster outflows, yielding higher blue-shifts. We discuss possible
elemental identifications for the observed features in the context of recent burst-driven wind
models.
