Cold dark matter (CDM) has shown to be an excellent candidate for the dark matter (DM) of the Universe
at large scales, however it presents some challenges at the galactic level. The scalar field dark
matter (SFDM), also called fuzzy, wave, Bose-Einstein condensate or ultra-light axion DM, is identical
to CDM at cosmological scales but different at the galactic ones. SFDM forms core halos, it has a natural
cut-off in its matter power spectrum and it predicts well-formed galaxies at high redshifts. In
this work we reproduce the rotation curves of high-resolution low surface brightness (LSB) and
SPARC galaxies with two SFDM profiles: (1)~The soliton+NFW profile in the fuzzy DM (FDM) model,
arising empirically from cosmological simulations of real, non-interacting scalar field (SF)
at zero temperature, and (2)~the multistate SFDM (mSFDM) profile, an exact solution to the Einstein-Klein-Gordon
equations for a real, self-interacting SF, with finite temperature into the SF potential, introducing
several quantum states as a realistic model for a SFDM halo. From the fits with the soliton+NFW profile,
we obtained for the boson mass $0.212< m_\psi/(10^{-23} \mathrm{eV}/c^2)<27.0$ and for the core
radius $0.326< r_c/\mathrm{kpc}<8.96$. From the combined analysis with the LSB galaxies, we obtained
$m_\psi = 0.554 \times10^{-23}\mathrm{eV}$, a result in tension with the severe cosmological
constraints. Also, we show the analytical mSFDM model fits the observations as well as or better
than the empirical soliton+NFW profile, and it reproduces naturally the wiggles present in some
galaxies, being a theoretically motivated framework additional or alternative to the FDM profile.
