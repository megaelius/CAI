A new class of faint, spectroscopically peculiar transients has emerged in the last decade. We term
these events "calcium-strong transients" (CaSTs) because of their atypically high calcium-to-oxygen
nebular line ratios. Previous studies have struggled to deduce the identity of their progenitors
due to a combination of their extremely extended radial distributions with respect to their host
galaxies and their relatively high rate of occurrence. In this work, we find that the CaST radial
distribution is consistent with the radial distribution of two populations of stars: old (ages
> 5 Gyr), low-metallicity (Z/Zsol < 0.3) stars and globular clusters. While no obvious progenitor
scenario arises from considering old, metal-poor stars, the alternative production site of globular
clusters leads us to narrow down the list of possible candidates to three binary scenarios: mergers
of helium and oxygen/neon white dwarfs; tidal disruptions of helium white dwarfs by neutron stars;
and stable accretion from low-mass helium-burning stars onto white dwarfs. While rare in the field,
these binary systems can be formed dynamically at much higher rates in globular clusters. Subsequent
binary hardening both increases their interaction rate and ejects them from their parent globular
clusters prior to mass transfer contact. Their production in, and ejection from, globular clusters
may explain their radial distribution and the absence of globular clusters at their explosion site.
This model predicts a currently undiscovered high rate of CaSTs in nuclear star clusters. Alternatively,
an undetermined progenitor scenario involving old, low-metallicity stars may instead hold the
key to understanding CaSTs.
