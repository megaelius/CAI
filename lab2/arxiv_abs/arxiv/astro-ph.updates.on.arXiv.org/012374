Transits of exoplanets across cool stars contain blended information about structures on the stellar
surface and about the planetary body and atmosphere. To advance understanding of how this information
is entangled, a surface-flux transport code, based on observed properties of the Sun's magnetic
field, is used to simulate the appearance of hypothetical stellar photospheres from the visible
near 4000 Angstrom to the near-IR at 1.6 micron, by mapping intensities characteristic of faculae
and spots onto stellar disks. Stellar appearances are computed for a Sun-like star of solar activity
up to a star with mean magnetic flux density ~30 times higher. Simulated transit signals for a Jupiter-class
planet are compared with observations. This (1) suggests that the solar paradigm is consistent
with observations for stars throughout the activity range explored provided that infrequent large
active regions with fluxes up to $\sim 3\times 10^{23}$ Mx are included in the emergence spectrum,
(2) quantitatively confirms that for such a model, faculae brighten relatively inactive stars
while starspots dim more active stars, (3) suggests that large starspots inferred from transits
of active stars are consistent with clusters of more compact spots seen in the model runs, (4) that
wavelength-dependent transit-depth effects caused by stellar magnetic activity for the range
of activity and the planetary diameter studied here can introduce apparent changes in the inferred
exoplanetary radii across wavelengths from a few hundred to a few thousand kilometers, increasing
with activity, and (5) that activity-modulated distortions of broadband stellar radiance across
the visible to near-IR spectrum can reach several percent.
