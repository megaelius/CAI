Unless the reality of spacetime singularities is assumed, astrophysical black holes cannot be
identical to their mathematical counterparts obtained as solutions of the Einstein field equations.
Mechanisms for singularity regularization would spark deviations with respect to the predictions
of general relativity, although these deviations are generally presumed to be negligible for all
practical purposes. Nonetheless, the strength and nature of these deviations remain open questions,
given the present uncertainties about the dynamics of quantum gravity. We present here a geometric
classification of all spherically symmetric spacetimes that could result from singularity regularization,
using a kinematic construction that is both exhaustive and oblivious to the dynamics of the fields
involved. Due to the minimal geometric assumptions behind it, this classification encompasses
virtually all modified gravity theories, and any theory of quantum gravity in which an effective
description in terms of an effective metric is available. The first noteworthy conclusion of our
analysis is that the number of independent classes of geometries that can be constructed is remarkably
limited, with no more than a handful of qualitatively different possibilities. But our most surprising
result is that this catalogue of possibilities clearly demonstrates that the degree of internal
consistency and the strength of deviations with respect to general relativity are strongly, and
positively, correlated. Hence, either quantum fluctuations of spacetime come to the rescue and
solve these internal consistency issues, or singularity regularization will percolate to macroscopic
(near-horizon) scales, radically changing our understanding of black holes and opening new opportunities
to test quantum gravity.
