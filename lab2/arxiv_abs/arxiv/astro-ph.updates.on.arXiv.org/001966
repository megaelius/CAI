The rate constants required to model the OH$^+$ observations in different regions of the interstellar
medium have been determined using state of the art quantum methods. First, state-to-state rate
constants for the H$_2(v=0,J=0,1)$+ O$^+$($^4S$) $\rightarrow$ H + OH$^+(X ^3\Sigma^-, v', N)$
reaction have been obtained using a quantum wave packet method. The calculations have been compared
with time-independent results to asses the accuracy of reaction probabilities at collision energies
of about 1 meV. The good agreement between the simulations and the existing experimental cross sections
in the $0.01-$1 eV energy range shows the quality of the results. The calculated state-to-state
rate constants have been fitted to an analytical form. Second, the Einstein coefficients of OH$^+$
have been obtained for all astronomically significant ro-vibrational bands involving the $X^3\Sigma^-$
and/or $A^3\Pi$ electronic states. For this purpose the potential energy curves and electric dipole
transition moments for seven electronic states of OH$^+$ are calculated with {\it ab initio} methods
at the highest level and including spin-orbit terms, and the rovibrational levels have been calculated
including the empirical spin-rotation and spin-spin terms. Third, the state-to-state rate constants
for inelastic collisions between He and OH$^+(X ^3\Sigma^-)$ have been calculated using a time-independent
close coupling method on a new potential energy surface. All these rates have been implemented in
detailed chemical and radiative transfer models. Applications of these models to various astronomical
sources show that inelastic collisions dominate the excitation of the rotational levels of OH$^+$.
In the models considered the excitation resulting from the chemical formation of OH$^+$ increases
the line fluxes by about 10 % or less depending on the density of the gas.
