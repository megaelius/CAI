Shock interaction has been argued to play a role in powering a range of optical transients, including
supernovae (particularly the superluminous class), classical novae, stellar mergers, tidal
disruption events, and fast blue optical transients. These same shocks can accelerate relativistic
ions, generating high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray emission via hadronic pion production. The
recent discovery of time-correlated optical and gamma-ray emission in classical novae has revealed
the important role of radiative shocks in powering these events, enabling an unprecedented view
of the properties of ion acceleration, including its efficiency and energy spectrum, under similar
physical conditions to shocks in extragalactic transients. Here we introduce a model for connecting
the radiated optical fluence of non-relativistic transients to their maximal neutrino and gamma-ray
fluence. We apply this technique to a wide range of extragalactic transient classes in order to place
limits on their contributions to the cosmological high-energy gamma-ray and neutrino backgrounds.
Based on a simple model for diffusive shock acceleration at radiative shocks, calibrated to novae,
we demonstrate that several of the most luminous transients can accelerate protons up to energies
$E_{\rm max} \gtrsim 10^{16}$ eV, sufficient to contribute to the IceCube astrophysical background.
Furthermore, several of the considered sources$-$particularly hydrogen-poor supernovae$-$may
serve as "hidden" gamma-ray sources due to the high gamma-ray opacity of their ejecta, evading constraints
imposed by the non-blazar Fermi-LAT background. However, adopting an ion acceleration efficiency
$\sim$ 0.3-1$\%$ motivated by nova observations, we find that currently known classes of non-relativistic,
potentially shock-powered transients contribute at most a few percent of the total IceCube background.
