Understanding the properties and physical mechanisms that shape dust attenuation curves in galaxies
is one of the fundamental questions of extragalactic astrophysics, with a great practical significance
for deriving the physical properties of galaxies, such as the star formation rate and stellar mass.
Attenuation curves result from a combination of dust grain properties, dust content, and the spatial
arrangement of dust and different populations of stars. In this review we assess the current state
of the field, paying particular attention to the importance of extinction curves as the building
blocks of attenuation laws. We introduce a quantitative framework to characterize and compare
extinction and attenuation curves, present a theoretical foundation for interpreting empirical
results, overview an array of observational methods, and review the observational state of the
field at both low and high redshift. Our main conclusions are: Attenuation curves exhibit a large
range of slopes, from curves with shallow (Milky Way-like) slopes to those exceeding the slope of
the SMC extinction curve. The slopes of the curves correlate strongly with the effective optical
opacities, in the sense that galaxies with low dust column density (lower visual attenuation) tend
to have steeper slopes, whereas the galaxies with high dust column density have shallower (grey)
slopes. Galaxies appear to exhibit a diverse range of 2175A UV bump strengths, but on average have
suppressed bumps compared to the average Milky Way extinction curve. Theoretical studies indicate
that variations in bump strength may result from similar geometric and radiative transfer effects
that drive the correlation between the slope and the dust column.
