We provide a detailed description of the Chimera code, a code developed to model core collapse supernovae
in multiple spatial dimensions. The core collapse supernova explosion mechanism remains the subject
of intense research. Progress to date demonstrates that it involves a complex interplay of neutrino
production, transport, and interaction in the stellar core, three-dimensional stellar core fluid
dynamics and its associated instabilities, nuclear burning, and the foundational physics of the
neutrino-stellar core weak interactions and the equations of state of all stellar core constituents
-particularly, the nuclear equation of state associated with nucleons, both free and bound in nuclei.
Chimera, by incorporating detailed neutrino transport, realistic neutrino-matter interactions,
three-dimensional hydrodynamics, realistic nuclear, leptonic, and photonic equations of state,
and a nuclear reaction network, along with other refinements, can be used to study the role of neutrino
radiation, hydrodynamic instabilities, and a variety of input physics in the explosion mechanism
itself. It can also be used to compute observables such as neutrino signatures, gravitational radiation,
and the products of nucleosynthesis associated with core collapse supernovae. The code contains
modules for neutrino transport, multidimensional compressible hydrodynamics, nuclear reactions,
a variety of neutrino interactions, equations of state, and modules to provide data for post-processing
observables such as the products of nucleosynthesis, and gravitational radiation. Chimera is
an evolving code, being updated periodically with improved input physics and numerical refinements.
We detail here the current version of the code, from which future improvements will stem, which can
in turn be described as needed in future publications.
