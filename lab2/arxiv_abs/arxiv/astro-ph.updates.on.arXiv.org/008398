We constrain the abundance of primordial black holes (PBH) using 2622 microlensing events obtained
from 5-years observations of stars in the Galactic bulge by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment
(OGLE). The majority of microlensing events display a single or at least continuous population
that has a peak around the light curve timescale $t_{\rm E}\simeq 20~{\rm days}$ and a wide distribution
over the range $t_{\rm E}\simeq [1, 300]~{\rm days}$, while the data also indicates a second population
of 6 ultrashort-timescale events in $t_{\rm E}\simeq [0.1,0.3]~{\rm days}$, which are advocated
to be due to free-floating planets. We confirm that the main population of OGLE events can be well
modeled by microlensing due to brown dwarfs, main sequence stars and stellar remnants (white dwarfs
and neutron stars) in the standard Galactic bulge and disk models for their spatial and velocity
distributions. Using the dark matter (DM) model for the Milky Way (MW) halo relative to the Galactic
bulge/disk models, we obtain the tightest upper bound on the PBH abundance in the mass range $M_{\rm
PBH}\simeq[10^{-6},10^{-3}]M_\odot$ (Earth-Jupiter mass range), if we employ null hypothesis
that the OGLE data does not contain any PBH microlensing event. More interestingly, we also show
that Earth-mass PBHs can well reproduce the 6 ultrashort-timescale events, without the need of
free-floating planets, if the mass fraction of PBH to DM is at a per cent level, which is consistent
with other constraints such as the microlensing search for Andromeda galaxy (M31) and the longer
timescale OGLE events. Our result gives a hint of PBH existence, and can be confirmed or falsified
by microlensing search for stars in M31, because M31 is towards the MW halo direction and should therefore
contain a much less number of free-floating planets, even if exist, than the direction to the MW center.
