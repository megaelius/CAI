The nearby and young M star AU Mic is surrounded by a debris disk in which we previously identified
a series of large-scale arch-like structures that have never been seen before in any other debris
disk and that move outward at high velocities. We initiated a monitoring program with the following
objectives: 1) track the location of the structures and better constrain their projected speeds,
2) search for new features emerging closer in, and ultimately 3) understand the mechanism responsible
for the motion and production of the disk features. AU Mic was observed at 11 different epochs between
August 2014 and October 2017 with the IR camera and spectrograph of SPHERE. These high-contrast
imaging data were processed with a variety of angular, spectral, and polarimetric differential
imaging techniques to reveal the faintest structures in the disk. We measured the projected separations
of the features in a systematic way for all epochs. We also applied the very same measurements to older
observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) with the visible cameras STIS and ACS. The main
outcomes of this work are 1) the recovery of the five southeastern broad arch-like structures we
identified in our first study, and confirmation of their fast motion (projected speed in the range
4-12 km/s); 2) the confirmation that the very first structures observed in 2004 with ACS are indeed
connected to those observed later with STIS and now SPHERE; 3) the discovery of two new very compact
structures at the northwest side of the disk (at 0.40" and 0.55" in May 2015) that move to the southeast
at low speed; and 4) the identification of a new arch-like structure that might be emerging at the
southeast side at about 0.4" from the star (as of May 2016). Abridged.
