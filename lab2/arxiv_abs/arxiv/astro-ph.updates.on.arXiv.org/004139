Among the various possibilities to probe the theory behind the recent accelerated expansion of
the universe, the energy conditions (ECs) are of particular interest, since it is possible to confront
and constrain the many models, including different theories of gravity, with observational data.
In this context, we use the ECs to probe any alternative theory whose extra term acts as a cosmological
constant. For this purpose, we apply a model-independent approach to reconstruct the recent expansion
of the universe. Using Type Ia supernova, baryon acoustic oscillations and cosmic-chronometer
data, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to put constraints on the effective cosmological
constant $\Omega^0_{\rm eff}$. By imposing that the cosmological constant is the only component
that possibly violates the ECs, we derive lower and upper bounds for its value. For instance, we obtain
that $0.59 < \Omega^0_{\rm eff} < 0.91$ and $0.40 < \Omega^0_{\rm eff} < 0.93$ within, respectively,
$1\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ confidence levels. In addition, about 30\% of the posterior distribution
is incompatible with a cosmological constant, showing that this method can potentially rule it
out as a mechanism for the accelerated expansion. We also study the consequence of these constraints
for two particular formulations of the bimetric massive gravity. Namely, we consider the Visser's
theory and the Hassan and Roses's massive gravity by choosing a background metric such that both
theories mimic General Relativity with a cosmological constant. Using the $\Omega^0_{\rm eff}$
observational bounds along with the upper bounds on the graviton mass we obtain constraints on the
parameter spaces of both theories.
