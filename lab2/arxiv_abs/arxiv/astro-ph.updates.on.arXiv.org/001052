Solar-like oscillations in red giants have been investigated with CoRoT and Kepler, while pulsations
in more evolved M giants have been studied with ground-based microlensing surveys. After 3.1 years
of observation with Kepler, it is now possible to make a link between these different observations
of semi-regular variables. We aim to identify period-luminosity sequences in evolved red giants
identified as semi-regular variables. Then, we investigate the consequences of the comparison
of ground-based and space-borne observations. We have first measured global oscillation parameters
of evolved red giants observed with Kepler with the envelope autocorrelation function method.
We then used an extended form of the universal red giant oscillation pattern, extrapolated to very
low frequency, to fully identify their oscillations. From the link between red giant oscillations
observed by Kepler and period-luminosity sequences, we have identified these relations in evolved
red giants as radial and non-radial solar-like oscillations. We were able to expand scaling relations
at very low frequency. This helped us to identify the different sequences of period-luminosity
relations, and allowed us to propose a calibration of the K magnitude with the observed frequency
large separation. Interpreting period-luminosity relations in red giants in terms of solar-like
oscillations allows us to investigate, with a firm physical basis, the time series obtained from
ground-based microlensing surveys. This can be done with an analytical expression that describes
the low-frequency oscillation spectra. The different behavior of oscillations at low frequency,
with frequency separations scaling only approximately with the square root of the mean stellar
density, can be used to address precisely the physics of the semi-regular variables.
