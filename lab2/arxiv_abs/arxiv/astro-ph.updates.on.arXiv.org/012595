Black hole and neutron star X-ray binary systems routinely show quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs)
in their X-ray flux. Despite being strong, easily measurable signals, their physical origin has
long remained elusive. However, recent observational and theoretical work has greatly improved
our understanding. Here, we briefly review the basic phenomenology of the different varieties
of QPO in both black hole and neutron star systems before focusing mainly on low frequency QPOs in
black hole systems, for which much of the recent progress has been made. We describe the detailed
statistical properties of these QPOs and review the physical models proposed in the literature,
with particular attention to those based on Lense-Thirring precession. This is a relativistic
effect whereby a spinning massive object twists up the surrounding spacetime, inducing nodal precession
in inclined orbits. We review the theory describing how an accretion flow reacts to the Lense-Thirring
effect, including analytic theory and recent numerical simulations. We then describe recent observational
tests that provide very strong evidence that at least a certain type of low frequency QPOs are a geometric
effect, and good evidence that they are the result of precession. We discuss the possibility of the
spin axis of the compact object being misaligned with the binary rotation axis for a large fraction
of X-ray binaries, as is required for QPOs to be driven specifically by Lense-Thirring precession,
as well as some outstanding gaps in our understanding and future opportunities provided by X-ray
polarimeters and/or high throughput X-ray detectors.
