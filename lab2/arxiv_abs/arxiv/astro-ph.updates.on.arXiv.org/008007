Context: Absorption lines of H$_2$ and HD molecules observed at high redshift in the line of sight
towards quasars are a test ground to search for variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio $\mu$.
For this purpose results from astronomical observations are compared with a compilation of molecular
data of the highest accuracy, obtained in laboratory studies as well as in first principles calculations.
Aims: A comprehensive line list is compiled for H$_2$ and HD absorption lines in the Lyman ($B^1\Sigma_u^+$
- $X^1\Sigma_g^+$) and Werner ($C^1\Pi_u$ - $X^1\Sigma_g^+$) bands systems up to the Lyman cutoff
at 912 \AA. Molecular parameters listed for each line $i$ are the transition wavelength $\lambda_i$,
the line oscillator strength $f_i$, the radiative damping parameter of the excited state $\Gamma_i$,
and the sensitivity coefficient $K_i$ for a variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio. Methods:
The transition wavelengths $\lambda_i$ for the H$_2$ and HD molecules are determined by a variety
of advanced high-precision spectroscopic experiments involving narrowband vacuum ultraviolet
lasers, Fourier-transform spectrometers and synchrotron radiation sources. Results for the
line oscillator strengths $f_i$, damping parameters $\Gamma_i$ and sensitivity coefficients
$K_i$ are obtained in theoretical quantum chemical calculations. Results: A new list of molecular
data is compiled for future analyses of cold clouds of hydrogen absorbers, specifically for studies
of $\mu$-variation from quasar data. The list is applied in a refit of quasar absorption spectra
of B0642$-$5038 and J1237$+$0647 yielding constraints on a variation of the proton-to-electron
mass ratio $\Delta\mu/\mu$ consistent with previous analyses.
