ABRIDGED- The UV-optical color magnitude diagram (CMD) of rich galaxy groups is characterised
by a well developed Red Sequence (RS), a Blue Cloud (BC) and the so-called Green Valley (GV). Loose,
less evolved groups of galaxies likely not virialized yet may lack a well defined RS. This is actually
explained in the framework of galaxy evolution. We are focussing on understanding galaxy migration
towards the RS, checking for signatures of such a transition in their photometric and morphological
properties. We report on the UV properties of a sample of ETGs galaxies inhabiting the RS. The analysis
of their structures, as derived by fitting a Sersic law to their UV luminosity profiles, suggests
the presence of an underlying disk. This is the hallmark of dissipation processes that still must
have a role in the evolution of this class of galaxies. SPH simulations with chemo-photometric implementations
able to match the global properties of our targets are used to derive their evolutionary paths through
UV-optical CDM, providing some fundamental information such as the crossing time through the GV,
which depends on their luminosity. The transition from the BC to the RS takes several Gyrs, being
about 3-5 Gyr for the the brightest galaxies and more long for fainter ones, if it occurs. The photometric
study of nearby galaxy structures in UV is seriously hampered by either the limited FoV of the cameras
(e.g in HST) or by the low spatial resolution of the images (e.g in the GALEX). Current missions equipped
with telescopes and cameras sensitive to UV wavelengths, such as Swift-UVOT and Astrosat-UVIT,
provide a relatively large FoV and better resolution than the GALEX. More powerful UV instruments
(size, resolution and FoV) are obviously bound to yield fundamental advances in the accuracy and
depth of the surface photometry and in the characterisation of the galaxy environment.
