We present an empirical study of contamination in deep, rapid, and wide-field optical follow-up
searches of GW sources from aLIGO. We utilize dedicated observations during four nights of imaging
with DECam. Our search covered $\sim56$ deg$^2$, with two visits per night separated by $\approx
3$~hours, in $i$- and $z$-band, followed by an additional set of $griz$ images three weeks later
to serve as reference images for subtraction, and for the purpose of identifying galaxy and stellar
counterparts for any transient sources. We achieve $5\sigma$ point-source limiting magnitudes
of $i \approx 23.5$ and $z \approx 22.4$ mag in the coadded single-epoch images. We conduct a search
for transient objects that can mimic the $i-z$ color behavior of both red ($i-z > 0.5$~mag) and blue
($i-z < 0$~mag) kilonova emission, finding 11 and 10 contaminants, respectively. Independent
of color, we identify 48 transients of interest. Additionally, we leverage the rapid cadence of
our observations to search for sources with characteristic timescales of $\approx1$ day and $\approx3$
hours, finding no potential contaminants. We assess the efficiency of our pipeline and search methodology
with injected point sources, finding that we are 90\% (60\%) efficient when searching for red (blue)
kilonova-like sources to a limiting magnitude of $i \lesssim 22.5$ mag. Applying these efficiencies,
we derive sky rates for kilonova contaminants in the red and blue regimes of $\mathcal{R}_{\rm red}
\approx 0.16$ deg$^{-2}$ and $\mathcal{R}_{\rm blue} \approx 0.80$ deg$^{-2}$. The total contamination
rate, independent of color, is $\mathcal{R}_{\rm all} \approx 1.79$ deg$^{-2}$. We compare our
derived results to optical follow-up searches of the GW events GW150914 and GW151226 and comment
on the outlook for GW follow-up searches as additional GW detectors (e.g., KAGRA, LIGO India) come
online in the next decade.
