Context: Convective motions overshooting to regions that are formally convectively stable cause
extended mixing. Aims: To determine the scaling of overshooting depth ($d_{\rm os}$) at the base
of the convection zone as a function of imposed energy flux ($\mathscr{F}_{\rm n}$) and to estimate
the extent of overshooting at the base of the solar convection zone. Methods: Three-dimensional
Cartesian simulations of compressible non-rotating convection with unstable and stable layers
are used. The simulations use either a fixed heat conduction profile or a temperature and density
dependent formulation based on Kramers opacity law. The simulations cover a range of almost four
orders of magnitude in the imposed flux. Results: Two distinct regimes were found where the scaling
properties of overshooting differ depending on the heat conductivity profile. A smooth heat conduction
profile (either fixed or through Kramers opacity law) and surface cooling via a relaxation term
leads to a relatively shallow power law with $d_{\rm os}\propto \mathscr{F}_{\rm n}^{0.08}$ for
low $\mathscr{F}_{\rm n}$. A fixed step-profile of the heat conductivity at the bottom of the convection
zone leads to a somewhat steeper dependency with $d_{\rm os}\propto \mathscr{F}_{\rm n}^{0.14}$
in the same regime. Furthermore, changing the heat conductivity artificially in the radiative
and overshoot layers to speed up thermal saturation is shown to lead to a substantial underestimation
of overshooting depth. Conclusions: Extrapolating from the results obtained with smooth heat
conductivity profiles, which are the most realistic of the setups considered, suggest that the
overshooting depth for the Sun is on the order of 10 per cent of the pressure scale height at the base
of the convection zone in broad agreement with helioseismic constraints.
