We present a kinematic study of the nuclear stellar disk in M31 at infrared wavelengths using high
spatial resolution integral field spectroscopy. The spatial resolution achieved, FWHM = 0."12
(0.45 pc at the distance of M31), has only previously been equaled in spectroscopic studies by space-based
long-slit observations. Using adaptive optics-corrected integral field spectroscopy from the
OSIRIS instrument at the W. M. Keck Observatory, we map the line-of-sight kinematics over the entire
old stellar eccentric disk orbiting the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at a distance of r<4 pc. The
peak velocity dispersion is 381+/-55 km/s , offset by 0.13 +/- 0.03 from the SMBH, consistent with
previous high-resolution long-slit observations. There is a lack of near-infrared (NIR) emission
at the position of the SMBH and young nuclear cluster, suggesting a spatial separation between the
young and old stellar populations within the nucleus. We compare the observed kinematics with dynamical
models from Peiris & Tremaine (2003). The best-fit disk orientation to the NIR flux is [$\theta_l$,
$\theta_i$, $\theta_a$] = [-33 +/- 4$^{\circ}$, 44 +/- 2$^{\circ}$, -15 +/- 15$^{\circ}$], which
is tilted with respect to both the larger-scale galactic disk and the best-fit orientation derived
from optical observations. The precession rate of the old disk is $\Omega_P$ = 0.0 +/- 3.9 km/s/pc,
lower than the majority of previous observations. This slow precession rate suggests that stellar
winds from the disk will collide and shock, driving rapid gas inflows and fueling an episodic central
starburst as suggested in Chang et al. (2007).
