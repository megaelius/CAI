We present the first scattered-light images of two debris disks around the F8 star HD 104860 and the
F0V star HD 192758, respectively $\sim45$ and $\sim67$ pc away. We detected these systems in the
F110W and F160W filters through our re-analysis of archival Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS data
with modern starlight subtraction techniques. Our image of HD 104860 confirms the morphology previously
observed by Herschel in thermal emission with a well-defined ring at radius $\sim114$ au inclined
$\sim58$ degrees. Although the outer edge profile is consistent with dynamical evolution models,
the sharp inner edge suggests sculpting by unseen perturbers. Our images of HD 192758 reveal a disk
at radius $\sim95$ au inclined by $\sim59$ degrees, never resolved so far. These disks have low scattering
albedos of 10% and 13% respectively, inconsistent with water ice grain compositions. They are reminiscent
of several other disks with similar inclination and scattering albedos: Fomalhaut, HD 92945, HD
202628, and HD 207129. They are also very distinct from brighter disks in the same inclination bin,
which point to different compositions between these two populations. Varying scattering albedo
values can be explained by different grain porosities, chemical compositions, or grain size distributions,
which may indicate distinct formation mechanisms or dynamical processes at work in these systems.
Finally, these faint disks with large infrared excesses may be representative of an underlying
population of systems with low albedo values. Searches with more sensitive instruments on HST or
on the James Webb Space Telescope and using state-of-the art starlight-subtraction methods may
help discover more of such faint systems.
