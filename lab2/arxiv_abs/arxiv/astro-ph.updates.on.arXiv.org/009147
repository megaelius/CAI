We present a Bayesian full-spectral-fitting analysis of 75 massive ($M_* > 10^{10.3} \mathrm{M_\odot}$)
UVJ-selected galaxies at redshifts of $1.0 < z < 1.3$, combining extremely deep rest-frame ultraviolet
spectroscopy from VANDELS with multi-wavelength photometry. By the use of a sophisticated physical
plus systematic uncertainties model, constructed within the Bagpipes code, we place strong constraints
on the star-formation histories (SFHs) of individual objects. We firstly constrain the stellar
mass vs stellar age relationship, finding a strong trend towards earlier formation with increasing
stellar mass (downsizing) of $1.48^{+0.34}_{-0.39}$ Gyr per decade in mass. We show that this is
consistent with other spectroscopic studies from $0 < z < 2$. This relationship places strong constraints
on the AGN-feedback models used in cosmological simulations. We demonstrate that, although the
relationships predicted by Simba and IllustrisTNG agree well with observations at $z=0.1$, they
are too shallow at $z=1$, predicting an evolution of $\lesssim0.5$ Gyr per decade in mass. Secondly,
we consider the connections between green-valley, post-starburst and quiescent galaxies, using
our inferred SFH shapes and the distributions of galaxy physical properties on the UVJ diagram.
The majority of our lowest-mass galaxies ($M_* \sim 10^{10.5} \mathrm{M_\odot}$) are consistent
with formation in recent ($z<2$), intense starburst events, with timescales of $\lesssim500$
Myr. A second class of objects experience extended star-formation epochs before rapidly quenching,
passing through both green-valley and post-starburst phases. The most massive galaxies in our
sample are extreme systems: already old by $z=1$, they formed at $z\sim5$ and quenched by $z=3$.
However, we find evidence for their continued evolution through both AGN and rejuvenated star-formation
activity.
