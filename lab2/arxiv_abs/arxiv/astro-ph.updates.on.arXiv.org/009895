(modified from published version) Twelve years ago the Catalina Sky Survey discovered Earth's
first known natural geocentric object other than the Moon, a few-meter diameter asteroid designated
2006 RH120. Despite significant improvements in ground-based telescope and detector technology
in the past decade the asteroid surveys have not discovered another temporarily-captured orbiter
(TCO; colloquially known as minimoons). Within a few years the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
(LSST) will either begin to regularly detect TCOs or force a re-analysis of the creation and dynamical
evolution of small asteroids in the inner solar system. The first studies of the provenance, properties,
and dynamics of Earth's minimoons suggested that there should be a steady state population with
about one 1- to 2-meter diameter captured objects at any time. That model was then improved and extended
to include the population of temporarily-captured flybys (TCFs), objects that fail to make an entire
revolution around Earth while energetically bound to the Earth-Moon system. Several different
techniques for discovering TCOs have been considered but their small diameters, proximity, and
rapid motion make them challenging targets for existing ground-based optical, meteor, and radar
surveys. We expect that if the TCO population is confirmed, and new objects are frequently discovered,
they can provide new opportunities for 1) studying the dynamics of the Earth-Moon system, 2) testing
models of the production and dynamical evolution of small asteroids from the asteroid belt, 3) rapid
and frequent low delta-v missions to multiple minimoons, and 4) evaluating in-situ resource utilization
techniques on asteroidal material. Here we review the past decade of minimoon studies in preparation
for capitalizing on the scientific and commercial opportunities of TCOs in the first decade of LSST
operations.
