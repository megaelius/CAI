As dark matter (DM) direct detection experiments continue to improve their sensitivity they will
inevitably encounter an irreducible background arising from coherent neutrino scattering. This
so-called "neutrino floor" may significantly reduce the sensitivity of an experiment to DM-nuclei
interactions, particularly if the recoil spectrum of the neutrino background is approximately
degenerate with the DM signal. This occurs for the conventionally considered spin-independent
(SI) or spin-dependent (SD) interactions. In such case, an increase in the experiment's exposure
by multiple orders of magnitude may not yield any significant increase in sensitivity. The typically
considered SI and SD interactions, however, do not adequately reflect the whole landscape of the
well-motivated DM models, which includes other interactions. Since particle DM has not been detected
yet in laboratories, it is essential to understand and maximize the detection capabilities for
a broad variety of possible models and signatures. In this work we explore the impact of the background
arising from various neutrino sources on the discovery potential of a DM signal for a large class
of viable DM-nucleus interactions and several potential futuristic experimental settings, with
different target elements. For some momentum suppressed cross sections, large DM particle masses
and heavier targets, we find that there is no suppression of the discovery limits due to neutrino
backgrounds. Further, we explicitly demonstrate that inelastic scattering, which could appear
in models with multicomponent dark sectors, would help to lift the signal degeneracy associated
with the neutrino floor. This study could assist with mapping out the optimal DM detection strategy
for the next generation of experiments.
