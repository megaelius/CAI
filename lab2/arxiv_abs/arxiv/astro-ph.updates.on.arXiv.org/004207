Convective boundary mixing (CBM) in the advanced evolutionary stages of massive stars is not well
understood. Structural changes caused by convection have an impact on the evolution as well as the
subsequent supernova, or lack thereof. The effects of convectively driven mixing across convective
boundaries during the post He core burning evolution of $25\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, solar-metallicity,
non-rotating stellar models is studied using the MESA stellar evolution code. CBM is modelled using
the exponentially decaying diffusion coefficient equation, the free parameter of which, $f_{\mathrm{cbm}}$,
is varied systematically throughout the course of the stellar model's evolution with values of
$(0.002, 0.012, 0.022, 0.032)$. The effect of varying this parameter produces mass ranges at collapse
in the ONe, Si, Fe cores of $(1.82\mathrm{M}_{\odot}, 4.36\mathrm{M}_{\odot})$, $(1.67\mathrm{M}_{\odot},
1.99\mathrm{M}_{\odot})$ and $(1.46\mathrm{M}_{\odot}, 1.70\mathrm{M}_{\odot})$ respectively,
with percent differences from the model with minimal CBM as large as 86.3%. At the presupernova stage,
the compactness of the stellar cores from O'Connor & Ott (2011), $\xi_M$, exhibit a range of $(0.120,
0.354)$, suggesting that the extent of CBM in the advanced burning stages of massive stars is an important
consideration for the explodability and type of compact remnant. The nucleosynthetic yields from
the models, most notably C, O, Ne, Mg and Si are also significantly affected by the CBM assumptions,
showing non-linear trends with increased mixing. The simulations show that interactions between
convective C, Ne and O shells produce significant non-linear changes in the evolution, whereas
from the end of Si burning, the structural changes attributed to the CBM are dominated by the growth
of the convective C shell. Progenitor structures for all the models are available from HERE (link
