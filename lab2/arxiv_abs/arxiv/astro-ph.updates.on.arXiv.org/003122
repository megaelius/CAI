Direct imaging suggests that there is a Jovian exoplanet around the primary A-star in the triple-star
system HD131399. We investigate a high-quality spectrum of the primary component HD131399A obtained
with FEROS on the ESO/MPG 2.2m telescope, aiming to characterise the star's atmospheric and fundamental
parameters, and to determine elemental abundances at high precision and accuracy. The aim is to
constrain the chemical composition of the birth cloud of the system and therefore the bulk composition
of the putative planet. A hybrid non-local thermal equilibrium (non-LTE) model atmosphere technique
is adopted for the quantitative spectral analysis. Comparison with the most recent stellar evolution
models yields the fundamental parameters. The atmospheric and fundamental stellar parameters
of HD131399A are constrained to Teff=9200+-100 K, log g=4.37+-0.10, M=1.95+0.08-0.06 Msun, R=1.51+0.13-0.10
Rsun, and log L/Lsun=1.17+-0.07, locating the star on the zero-age main sequence. Non-LTE effects
on the derived metal abundances are often smaller than 0.1dex, but can reach up to ~0.8dex for individual
lines. The observed lighter elements up to calcium are overall consistent with present-day cosmic
abundances, with a C/O ratio of 0.45$\pm$0.07 by number, while the heavier elements show mild overabundances.
We conclude that the birth cloud of the system had a standard chemical composition, but we witness
the onset of the Am phenomenon in the slowly rotating star. We furthermore show that non-LTE analyses
have the potential to solve the remaining discrepancies between observed abundances and predictions
by diffusion models for Am stars. Moreover, the present case allows mass loss, not turbulent mixing,
to be identified as the main transport process competing with diffusion in very young Am stars.
