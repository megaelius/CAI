Mass outflow rates and loading factors are typically used to infer the quenching potential of galactic-scale
outflows. However, these generally rely on observations of a single gas phase which can severely
underestimate the total ejected gas mass. To address this, we use observations of high mass ($\geqslant$10$^{10}$
M$_{\odot}$), normal star-forming galaxies at $z\sim$0 from the MaNGA, xCOLD GASS, xGASS and ALFALFA
surveys and a stacking of NaD, H$\alpha$, CO(1-0) and HI 21cm tracers with the aim of placing constraints
on an average, total mass outflow rate and loading factor. We find detections of outflows in both
neutral and ionised gas tracers, with no detections in stacks of molecular or atomic gas emission.
Modelling of the outflow components reveals velocities of $|$v$_{\text{NaD}}|$=131 km s$^{-1}$
and $|$v$_{\text{H}\alpha}|$=439 km s$^{-1}$ and outflow rates of $\dot{M}_{\text{NaD}}$=7.55
M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ and $\dot{M}_{\text{H}\alpha}$=0.10 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for neutral
and ionised gas, respectively. Assuming a molecular/atomic outflow velocity of 200 km s$^{-1}$,
we derive upper limits of $\dot{M}_{\text{CO}}<$19.43 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ and $\dot{M}_{\text{HI}}<$26.72
M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for the molecular and atomic gas, respectively. Combining the detections
and upper limits, we find average total outflow rates of $\dot{M}_{\text{tot}}\lesssim$27 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$
and a loading factor of $\eta_{\text{tot}}\lesssim$6.39, with molecular gas likely contributing
$\lesssim$72% of the total mass outflow rate, and neutral and ionised gas contributing $\sim$28%
and $<$1%, respectively. Our results suggest that, to first order, a degree of quenching via ejective
feedback could occur in normal galaxies when considering all gas phases, even in the absence of an
AGN.
