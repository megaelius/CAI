A common problem in cosmology is to integrate the product of two or more spherical Bessel functions
(sBFs) with different configuration-space arguments against the power spectrum or its square,
weighted by powers of wavenumber. Naively computing them scales as $N_{\rm g}^{p+1}$ with $p$ the
number of configuration space arguments and $N_{\rm g}$ the grid size, and they cannot be done with
Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs). Here we show that by rewriting the sBFs as sums of products of sine
and cosine and then using the product to sum identities, these integrals can then be performed using
1-D FFTs with $N_{\rm g} \log N_{\rm g}$ scaling. This "rotation" method has the potential to accelerate
significantly a number of calculations in cosmology, such as perturbation theory predictions
of loop integrals, higher order correlation functions, and analytic templates for correlation
function covariance matrices. We implement this approach numerically both in a free-standing,
publicly-available \textsc{Python} code and within the larger, publicly-available package
\texttt{mcfit}. The rotation method evaluated with direct integrations already offers a factor
of 6-10$\times$ speed-up over the naive approach in our test cases. Using FFTs, which the rotation
method enables, then further improves this to a speed-up of $\sim$$1000-3000\times$ over the naive
approach. The rotation method should be useful in light of upcoming large datasets such as DESI or
LSST. In analysing these datasets recomputation of these integrals a substantial number of times,
for instance to update perturbation theory predictions or covariance matrices as the input linear
power spectrum is changed, will be one piece in a Monte Carlo Markov Chain cosmological parameter
search: thus the overall savings from our method should be significant.
