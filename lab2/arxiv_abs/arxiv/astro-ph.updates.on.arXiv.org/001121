We present an approximate calculation of the full Bayesian posterior probability distribution
for the local non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\text{nl}}$ from observations of cosmic microwave
background anisotropies within the framework of information field theory. The approximation
that we introduce allows us to dispense with numerically expensive sampling techniques. We use
a novel posterior validation method (DIP test) in cosmology to test the precision of our method.
It transfers inaccuracies of the calculated posterior into deviations from a uniform distribution
for a specially constructed test quantity. For this procedure we study toy cases that use one- and
two-dimensional flat skies, as well as the full spherical sky. We find that we are able to calculate
the posterior precisely under a flat-sky approximation, albeit not in the spherical case. We argue
that this is most likely due to an insufficient precision of the used numerical implementation of
the spherical harmonic transform, which might affect other non-Gaussianity estimators as well.
Furthermore, we present how a nonlinear reconstruction of the primordial gravitational potential
on the full spherical sky can be obtained in principle. Using the flat-sky approximation, we find
deviations for the posterior of $f_{\text{nl}}$ from a Gaussian shape that become more significant
for larger values of the underlying true $f_{\text{nl}}$. We also perform a comparison to the well-known
estimator of Komatsu et al. [Astrophys. J. 634, 14 (2005)] and finally derive the posterior for the
local non-Gaussianity parameter $g_{\text{nl}}$ as an example of how to extend the introduced
formalism to higher orders of non-Gaussianity.
