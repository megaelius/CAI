(Abridged) We explore the role of X-ray photoevaporation in the evolution and dispersal of viscously
evolving T-Tauri discs. We show that the X-ray photoevaporation wind rates scale linearly with
X-ray luminosity, such that the observed range of X-ray luminosities for solar-type T-Tauri stars
(10e28-10e31 erg\s) gives rise to vigorous disc winds with rates of order 10e-10-10e-7 M_sun/yr.
We use the wind solutions from radiation-hydrodynamic models, coupled to a viscous evolution model
to construct a population synthesis model so that we may study the physical properties of evolving
discs and so-called `transition discs'. Current observations of disc lifetimes and accretion
rates can be matched by our model assuming a viscosity parameter alpha = 2.5e-3. Our models confirm
that X-rays play a dominant role in the evolution and dispersal of protoplanetary discs giving rise
to the observed diverse population of inner hole `transition' sources which include those with
massive outer discs, those with gas in their inner holes and those with detectable accretion signatures.
To help understand the nature of observed transition discs we present a diagnostic diagram based
on accretion rates versus inner hole sizes that demonstrate that, contrary to recent claims, many
of the observed accreting and non accreting transition discs can easily be explained by X-ray photoevaporation.
Finally, we confirm the conjecture of Drake et al. (2009), that accretion is suppressed by the X-rays
through `photoevaporation starved accretion' and predict this effect can give rise to a negative
correlation between X-ray luminosity and accretion rate, as reported in the Orion data.
