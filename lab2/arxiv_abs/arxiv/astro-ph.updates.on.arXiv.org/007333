We use photoionization models designed to reconcile the joint rest-UV-optical spectra of high-z
star-forming galaxies to self-consistently infer the gas chemistry and nebular ionization and
excitation conditions for ~150 galaxies from the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS), using
only observations of their rest-optical nebular spectra. We find that the majority of z~2-3 KBSS
galaxies are moderately O-rich, with an interquartile range in 12+log(O/H)=8.29-8.56, and have
significantly sub-solar Fe enrichment, with an interquartile range of [Fe/H]=[-0.79,-0.53],
contributing additional evidence in favor of super-solar O/Fe in high-z galaxies. Model-inferred
ionization parameter and N/O are strongly correlated with common strong-line indices (such as
O32 and N2O2), with the latter exhibiting similar behavior to local extragalactic HII regions.
In contrast, diagnostics commonly used for measuring gas-phase O/H (such as N2 and O3N2) show relatively
large scatter with the overall amount of oxygen present in the gas and behave differently than observed
at z~0. We provide a new calibration for using R23 to measure O/H in typical high-z galaxies, although
it is most useful for relatively O-rich galaxies; combining O32 and R23 does not yield a more effective
calibration. Finally, we consider implications for the intrinsic correlations between physical
conditions across the galaxy sample and find that N/O varies with O/H in high-z galaxies in a manner
almost identical to local HII regions. However, we do not find a strong anti-correlation between
ionization parameter and metallicity (O/H or Fe/H) in high-z galaxies, which is one of the principal
bases for using strong-line ratios to infer oxygen abundance.
