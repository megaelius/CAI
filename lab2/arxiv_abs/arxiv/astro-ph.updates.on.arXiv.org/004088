We attempt to determine the relative fraction of stars that have undergone significant radial migration
by studying the orbital properties of metal-rich ([Fe/H]$>0.1$) stars within 2 kpc of the Sun using
a sample of more than 3,000 stars selected from iDR4 of the Gaia-ESO Survey. We investigate the kinematic
properties, such as velocity dispersion and orbital parameters, of stellar populations near the
sun as a function of [Mg/Fe] and [Fe/H], which could show evidence of a major merger in the past history
of the Milky Way. This was done using the stellar parameters from the Gaia-ESO Survey along with proper
motions from PPMXL to determine distances, kinematics, and orbital properties for these stars
to analyze the chemodynamic properties of stellar populations near the Sun. Analyzing the kinematics
of the most metal-rich stars ([Fe/H]$>0.1$), we find that more than half have small eccentricities
($e<0.2$) or are on nearly circular orbits. Slightly more than 20\% of the metal-rich stars have
perigalacticons $R_p>7$ kpc. We find that the highest [Mg/Fe], metal-poor populations have lower
vertical and radial velocity dispersions compared to lower [Mg/Fe] populations of similar metallicity
by $\sim10$ km s$^{-1}$. The median eccentricity increases linearly with [Mg/Fe] across all metallicities,
while the perigalacticon decreases with increasing [Mg/Fe] for all metallicities. Finally, the
most [Mg/Fe]-rich stars are found to have significant asymmetric drift and rotate more than 40 km
s$^{-1}$ slower than stars with lower [Mg/Fe] ratios. While our results cannot constrain how far
stars have migrated, we propose that migration processes are likely to have played an important
role in the evolution of the Milky Way, with metal-rich stars migrating from the inner disk toward
to solar neighborhood and past mergers potentially driving enhanced migration of older stellar
populations in the disk.
