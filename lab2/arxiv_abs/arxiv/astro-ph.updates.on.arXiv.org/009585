In the standard inflationary paradigm, cosmological density perturbations are generated as quantum
fluctuations in the early Universe, but then undergo a quantum-to-classical transition. A key
role in this transition is played by squeezing of the quantum state, which is a result of the strong
suppression of the decaying mode component of the perturbations. Motivated by ever improving measurements
of the cosmological perturbations, we ask whether there are scenarios where this decaying mode
is nevertheless still observable in the late Universe, ideally leading to a ``smoking gun'' signature
of the quantum nature of the perturbations. We address this question by evolving the quantum state
of the perturbations from inflation into the post-inflationary Universe. After recovering the
standard result that in slow-roll (SR) inflation the decaying mode is indeed hopelessly suppressed
by the time the perturbations are observed (by $\sim 115$ orders of magnitude), we turn to ultra slow-roll
(USR) inflation, a scenario in which the usual decaying mode actually grows on super-horizon scales.
Despite this drastic difference in the behavior of the mode functions, we find also in USR that the
late-Universe decaying mode amplitude is dramatically suppressed, in fact by the same $\sim 115$
orders of magnitude. We finally explain that this large suppression is a general result that holds
beyond the SR and USR scenarios considered and follows from a modified version of Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle and the observed amplitude of the primordial power spectrum. The classical behavior
of the perturbations is thus closely related to the classical behavior of macroscopic objects drawing
an analogy with the position of a massive particle, the curvature perturbations today have an enormous
effective mass of order $m_{\rm pl}^2/H_0^2 \sim 10^{120}$, making them highly classical.
