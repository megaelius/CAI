The orbital shapes of galaxies is a probe of their formation and evolution. The Bayesian MAMPOSSt
mass/orbit modeling algorithm is used to jointly fit the distribution of elliptical (E), spiral/Irr
(S), and S0 galaxies in projected phase space, on 3 pseudo-clusters (built by stacking the clusters
after renormalizing their positions and velocities) of 54 regular clusters from the WINGS Survey,
with at least 30 member velocities. Our pseudo-clusters (stacks) contain nearly 5000 galaxies
with available velocities and morphological types. 30 runs of MAMPOSSt with different priors are
presented. The highest MAMPOSSt likelihoods are obtained for generalized NFW models with steeper
inner slope or a double NFW cluster+BCG model. However, there is no strong Bayesian evidence for
a steeper profile than the NFW model. The mass concentration matches the predictions from cosmological
simulations. Ellipticals usually trace best the mass distribution, while S0s are close. Spirals
show increasingly radial orbits at increasing radius, as do S0s on two stacks, and Es on one stack.
The inner orbits of all 3 types in the 3 stacks are consistent with isotropy. Spirals should transform
rapidly into early-types given their much larger extent in clusters. Outer radial orbits are expected
for the spirals, a consequence of their recent radial infall into the cluster. The less radial orbits
we find for Ellipticals & S0s could be related to the longer time they spend in the cluster. We show
that 2-body relaxation is too slow to explain the inner isotropy of the E/S0s, which suggests that
inner isotropy is the consequence of violent relaxation during major cluster mergers or dynamical
friction and tidal braking acting on subclusters. We propose that the inner isotropy of the short-lived
spirals is a selection effect of spirals passing only once through pericenter before being transformed
into E/S0 morphologies.
