Motivated by recent developments in perturbative calculations of the nonlinear evolution of large-scale
structure, we present an iterative algorithm to reconstruct the initial conditions in a given volume
starting from the dark matter distribution in real space. In our algorithm, objects are first moved
back iteratively along estimated potential gradients, with a progressively reduced smoothing
scale, until a nearly uniform catalog is obtained. The linear initial density is then estimated
as the divergence of the cumulative displacement, with an optional second-order correction. This
algorithm should undo nonlinear effects up to one-loop order, including the higher-order infrared
resummation piece. We test the method using dark matter simulations in real space. At redshift $z=0$,
we find that after eight iterations the reconstructed density is more than $95\%$ correlated with
the initial density at $k\le 0.35\; h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The reconstruction also reduces the
power in the difference between reconstructed and initial fields by more than 2 orders of magnitude
at $k\le 0.2\; h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and it extends the range of scales where the full broadband
shape of the power spectrum matches linear theory by a factor of 2-3. As a specific application, we
consider measurements of the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale that can be improved by
reducing the degradation effects of large-scale flows. In our idealized dark matter simulations,
the method improves the BAO signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 2.7 at $z=0$ and by a factor of 2.5
at $z=0.6$, improving standard BAO reconstruction by $70\%$ at $z=0$ and $30\%$ at $z=0.6$, and
matching the optimal BAO signal and signal-to-noise ratio of the linear density in the same volume.
For BAO, the iterative nature of the reconstruction is the most important aspect.
