Despite the discovery of thousands of exoplanets in recent years, the number of known exoplanets
in star clusters remains tiny. This may be a consequence of close stellar encounters perturbing
the dynamical evolution of planetary systems in these clusters. Here, we present the results from
direct $N$-body simulations of multiplanetary systems embedded in star clusters containing $N
= 8k, 16k, 32k$, and $64k$ stars. The planetary systems, which consist of the four Solar system giant
planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, are initialized in different orbital configurations,
to study the effect of the system architecture on the dynamical evolution of the entire planetary
system, and on the escape rate of the individual planets. We find that the current orbital parameters
of the Solar system giants (with initially circular orbits, as well as with present-day eccentricities)
and a slightly more compact configuration, have a high resilience against stellar perturbations.
A configuration with initial mean-motion resonances of 3:2, 3:2, and 5:4 between the planets, which
is inspired by the Nice model, and for which the two outermost planets are usually ejected within
the first $10^5$ yr, is in many cases stabilized due to the removal of the resonances by external stellar
perturbation and by the rapid ejection of at least one planet. Assigning all planets the same mass
of 1 Jovian mass almost equalizes the survival fractions. Our simulations reproduce the broad diversity
amongst observed exoplanet systems. We find not only many very wide and/or eccentric orbits, but
also a significant number of (stable) retrograde orbits.
