Essentially all low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in the soft state appear to drive powerful equatorial
disc winds. A simple mechanism for driving such outflows involves X-ray heating of the top of the
disc atmosphere to the Compton temperature. Beyond the Compton radius, the thermal speed exceeds
the escape velocity, and mass loss is inevitable. Here, we present the first coupled radiation-hydrodynamic
simulation of such thermally-driven disc winds. The main advance over previous modelling efforts
is that the frequency-dependent attenuation of the irradiating SED is taken into account. We can
therefore relax the approximation that the wind is optically thin throughout which is unlikely
to hold in the crucial acceleration zone of the flow. The main remaining limitations of our simulations
are connected to our treatment of optically thick regions. Adopting parameters representative
of the wind-driving LMXB GRO~J1655-40, our radiation-hydrodynamic model yields a mass-loss rate
that is $\simeq5\times$ lower than that suggested by pure hydrodynamic, optically thin models.
This outflow rate still represents more than twice the accretion rate and agrees well with the mass-loss
rate inferred from Chandra/HETG observations of GRO~J1655-40 at a time when the system had a similar
luminosity to that adopted in our simulations. The Fe XXV and Fe XXVI Lyman $\rm{\alpha}~$ absorption
line profiles observed in this state are slightly stronger than those predicted by our simulations
but the qualitative agreement between observed and simulated outflow properties means that thermal
driving is a viable mechanism for powering the disc winds seen in soft-state LMXBs.
