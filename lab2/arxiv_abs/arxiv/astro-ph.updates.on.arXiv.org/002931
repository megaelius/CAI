We develop a method for constraining the scaling relation of optical richness ($\lambda$) with
halo masses ($M$) for a sample of galaxy clusters based on a forward modeling approach for the Planck
cosmology, where we model the probability distribution of optical richness for a given mass, $P(\ln
\lambda| M)$. To model the abundance and the stacked lensing profiles, we employ the halo emulator
that outputs the halo mass function and the stacked lensing profile for an arbitrary set of halo mass
and redshift, calibrated based on a suite of high-resolution $N$-body simulations. By applying
our method to 8,312 SDSS redMaPPer clusters with $20\le \lambda \le 100$ and $0.10\le z_{\lambda}\le0.33$,
we show that the log-normal distribution model for $P(\ln \lambda|M)$, with four free parameters,
well reproduces the measured abundances and lensing profiles simultaneously. The constraints
are characterized by the mean relation, $\left\langle \ln{\lambda}\right\rangle(M)=A+B\ln(M/M_{\rm
pivot})$, with $A=3.211^{+0.043}_{-0.045}$ and $B=0.999^{+0.037}_{-0.051}$ (68% CL), for
the pivot mass scale $M_{\rm pivot}=3\times 10^{14} h^{-1}M_\odot$, and the scatter $\sigma_{\mathrm{\ln\lambda}|M}=\sigma_0+q\ln(M/M_{\rm
pivot})$ with $\sigma_0=0.451^{+0.045}_{-0.037}$ and $q=-0.173^{+0.032}_{-0.024}$. However,
we find that a large scatter for the low richness bins, especially $20\le \lambda \lesssim 30$, is
required in order for the model to reproduce the measurements by the contributions from low-mass
halos for the Planck cosmology. Without such a large scatter, the model prediction for the lensing
profiles tends to overestimate the measured amplitudes. This might imply a possible contamination
of low-richness clusters due to the projection effects. Such a low-mass halo contribution is significantly
reduced when applying our method to the sample of $30\le \lambda \le 100$.
