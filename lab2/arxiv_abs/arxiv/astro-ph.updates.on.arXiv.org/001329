In a turbulent proto-planetary disk, dust grains undergo large density fluctuations and under
the right circumstances, these grain overdensities can overcome shear, turbulent, and gas pressure
support to collapse under self-gravity (forming a 'pebble pile' planetesimal). Using insights
from simulations and a new analytic model for the fluctuations, we calculate the rate-of-formation
and mass function of self-gravitating, collapsing planetesimal-mass bodies formed by this mechanism.
The statistics of this process depend sensitively on the size/stopping time of the largest grains,
disk surface density, and turbulent Mach numbers. However, when it occurs, we predict that the resulting
planetesimal mass function is broad and quasi-universal, with a slope dN/dM~1/M, spanning a size/mass
range ~10-1e4 km (~1e-9-5.0 M_Earth). Collapse to planetesimal through super-Earth masses is
possible. The key condition is that grain density fluctuations reach large amplitudes on large
scales, where gravitational instability proceeds most easily (collapse of small grains is strongly
suppressed by turbulent vorticity). We show this leads to a new criterion for 'pebble-pile' formation
in terms of the dimensionless particle stopping time (tau_stop > f(Q,Z,alpha)). In a MMSN, this
requires grains larger than a=(50,1,0.1)cm at r=(1,30,100)au. So at large radii, this can easily
occur and seed core accretion. At small radii, it would depend on the existence of large boulders.
However, because density fluctuations depend super-exponentially on tau_stop (inversely proportional
to disk surface density), lower-density disks are more unstable! In fact, we predict that cm-sized
grains at ~1au will form pebble piles in a disk with ~10% the MMSN density, so planet formation at ~au
may generically occur late, as disks are evaporating.
