[Abridged] We develop and benchmark a fast and easy-to-use effective-opacity formalism for line
and continuum radiative transfer in an accelerating two-component clumpy medium. The formalism
bridges the limits of optically thin and thick clumps, and is here used to i) design a simple vorosity-modified
Sobolev with exact integration (vmSEI) method for analyzing UV wind resonance lines in hot, massive
stars, and ii) derive simple correction factors to the line force driving the outflows of such stars.
We show that (for a given ionization factor) UV resonance doublets may be used to analytically predict
the upward corrections in empirically inferred mass-loss rates associated with porosity in velocity
space (a.k.a. velocity-porosity, or vorosity), but that severe solution degeneracies exist.
For an inter-clump density set to 1 % of the mean density, we for O and B supergiants derive upward empirical
mass-loss corrections of typically factors of either ~5 or ~50, depending on which of the two applicable
solutions is chosen. Overall, our results indicate this solution dichotomy severely limits the
use of UV resonance lines as direct mass-loss indicators of clumped hot stellar winds. We next apply
the effective-opacity formalism to the standard CAK theory of line-driven winds. By analytic and
numerical hydrodynamics calculations, we show that in cases where vorosity is important at the
critical point setting the mass-loss rate, the reduced line-force leads to a lower theoretical
mass loss, by a factor scaling with the normalized velocity filling factor fvel. On the other hand,
if vorosity is important only above this critical point, the predicted mass loss is not affected,
but the wind terminal speed is reduced. This shows that porosity in velocity space can have a significant
impact not only on the diagnostics, but also on the dynamics and theory of radiatively driven winds.
