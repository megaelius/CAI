The space-based Kepler mission provided four years of highly precise and almost uninterrupted
photometry for hundreds of $\gamma$ Doradus stars and tens of SPB stars, finally allowing us to apply
asteroseismology to these gravity mode pulsators. Without rotation, gravity modes are equally
spaced in period. This simple structure does not hold in rotating stars for which rotation needs
to be taken into account to accurately interpret the oscillation spectrum. We aim to develop a stellar-model-independent
method to analyse and interpret the oscillation spectrum of $\gamma$ Dor and SPB stars. Within the
traditional approximation of rotation, we highlight the possibility of recovering the equidistance
of period spacings by stretching the pulsation periods. The stretching function depends on the
degree and azimuthal order of gravity modes and the rotation rate of the star. In this new stretched
space, the pulsation modes are regularly spaced by the stellar buoyancy radius. On the basis of this
property, we implemented a method to search for these new regularities and simultaneously infer
the rotation frequency and buoyancy radius. Tests on synthetic spectra computed with a non-perturbative
approach show that we can retrieve these two parameters with reasonable accuracy along with the
mode identification. In uniformly rotating models of a typical $\gamma$ Dor star, and for the most
observed prograde dipole modes, we show that the accuracy on the derived parameters is better than
5% on both the internal rotation rate and the buoyancy radius. Finally, we apply the method to two
stars of the Kepler field, a $\gamma$ Dor and an SPB, and compare our results with those of other existing
methods. We provide a stellar-model-independent method to obtain the near-core rotation rate,
the buoyancy radius and mode identification from g-mode spectra of $\gamma$ Dor and SPB stars.
