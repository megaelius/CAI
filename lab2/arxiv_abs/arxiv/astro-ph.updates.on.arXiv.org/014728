We present updated cosmological constraints for the KiDS+VIKING-450 cosmic shear data set (KV450),
estimated using redshift distributions and photometric samples defined using self-organising
maps (SOMs). Our fiducial analysis finds marginal posterior constraints of $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm
m}/0.3}=0.716^{+0.043}_{-0.038}$; smaller than, but otherwise consistent with, previous work
using this data set ($|\Delta S_8| = 0.023$). We analyse additional samples and redshift distributions
constructed in three ways: excluding certain spectroscopic surveys during redshift calibration,
excluding lower-confidence spectroscopic redshifts in redshift calibration, and considering
only photometric sources which are jointly calibrated by at least three spectroscopic surveys.
In all cases, the method utilised here proves robust: we find a maximal deviation from our fiducial
analysis of $|\Delta S_8| \leq 0.011$ for all samples defined and analysed using our SOM. To demonstrate
the reduction in systematic biases found within our analysis, we highlight our results when performing
redshift calibration without the DEEP2 spectroscopic data set. In this case we find marginal posterior
constraints of $S_8=0.707_{-0.042}^{+0.046}$; a difference with respect to the fiducial that
is both significantly smaller than, and in the opposite direction to, the equivalent shift from
previous work. These results suggest that our improved cosmological parameter estimates are insensitive
to pathological misrepresentation of photometric sources by the spectroscopy used for direct
redshift calibration, and therefore that this systematic effect cannot be responsible for the
observed difference between $S_8$ estimates made with KV450 and Planck CMB probes.
