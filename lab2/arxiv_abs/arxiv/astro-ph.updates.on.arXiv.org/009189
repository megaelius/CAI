Most of planet formation models that incorporate planetesimal fragmentation consider a catastrophic
impact energy threshold for basalts at a constant velocity of 3 km/s during all the process of the
formation of the planets. However, as planets grow the relative velocities of the surrounding planetesimals
increase from velocities of the order of m/s to a few km/s. In addition, beyond the ice line where giant
planets are formed, planetesimals are expected to be composed roughly by 50 percentage of ices.
We aim to study the role of planetesimal fragmentation on giant planet formation considering planetesimal
catastrophic impact energy threshold as a function of the planetesimal relative velocities and
compositions. We improve our model of planetesimal fragmentation incorporating a functional
form of the catastrophic impact energy threshold with the planetesimal relative velocities and
compositions. We also improve in our model the accretion of small fragments produced by the fragmentation
of planetesimals during the collisional cascade considering specific pebble accretion rates.
We find that a more accurate and realistic model for the calculation of the catastrophic impact energy
threshold tends to slow down the formation of massive cores. Only for reduced grain opacity values
at the envelope of the planet, the cross-over mass is achieved before the disk time-scale dissipation.
While planetesimal fragmentation favors the quick formation of massive cores of 5-10 Earth masses
the cross-over mass could be inhibited by planetesimal fragmentation. However, grain opacity
reduction or pollution by the accreted planetesimals together with planetesimal fragmentation
could explain the formation of giant planets with low-mass cores.
