We explore how environment affects the metallicity of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) using 13
low mass galaxy groups (2-5 galaxies) at $\langle z_{abs}\rangle=0.25$ identified near background
quasars. Using quasar spectra from HST/COS and from Keck/HIRES or VLT/UVES we measure column densities
of, or determine limits on, CGM absorption lines. We use a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach with
Cloudy to estimate metallicities of cool ($T\sim10^4$K) CGM gas within groups and compare them
to CGM metallicities of 47 isolated galaxies. Both group and isolated CGM metallicities span a wide
range ($-2<$[Si/H]$<0$), where the mean group ($-0.54\pm0.22$) and isolated ($-0.77\pm0.14$)
CGM metallicities are similar. Group and isolated environments have similar distributions of
{\HI} column densities as a function of impact parameter. However, contrary to isolated galaxies,
we do not find an anti-correlation between {\HI} column density and the nearest group galaxy impact
parameter. We additionally divided the groups by member luminosity ratios (i.e., galaxy-galaxy
and galaxy-dwarf groups). While there was no significant difference in their mean metallicities,
a modest increase in sample size should allow one to statistically identify a higher CGM metallicity
in galaxy-dwarf groups compared to galaxy-galaxy groups. We conclude that either environmental
effects have not played an important role in the metallicity of the CGM at this stage and expect that
this may only occur when galaxies are strongly interacting or merging, or that some isolated galaxies
have higher CGM metallicities due to past interactions. Thus, environment does not seem to be the
cause of the CGM metallicity bimodality.
