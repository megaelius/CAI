Scaling relations are the most powerful astrophysical tools to set constraints to the physical
mechanisms of astro- nomical sources and to infer properties that cannot be accessed directly.
We re-investigate here one of these scaling relations in active galactic nuclei (AGN); the so-called
X-ray variability plane (or mass-luminosity-timescale relation, McHardy et al. 2006). This relation
links the power-spectral density (PSD) break frequency with the super-massive black hole (SMBH)
mass and the bolometric luminosity. We used available XMM -Newton observations of a sample of 22
AGN to study the PSD and spectra in short segments within each observation. This allows us to report
for the first time that the PSD break frequency varies for each object, showing variations in 19 out
of the 22 AGN analyzed. Our analysis of the variability plane confirms the relation between the break
frequency and the SMBH mass and finds that the obscuration along the line of sight NH (or the variations
on the obscuration using its standard deviation, $\rm{\Delta}$(NH)) is also a required parameter,
at least for the range of frequencies analyzed here (3x10E-5-5x10E-2Hz). We constrain a new variability
plane of the form: log($\nu_{Break}$) = (-0.589$\rm{\pm}$0.005) log(MBH ) + (0.10$\rm{\pm}$0.01)
log(NH ) - (1.5$\rm{\pm}$0.3) (or log($\nu_{Break}$)=(-0.549$\rm{\pm}$0.009)log(MBH)+(0.56$\rm{\pm}$0.06)$\rm{\Delta}$(NH)+(0.19$\rm{\pm}$0.08)).
The X-ray variability plane found by McHardy et al. (2006) is roughly recovered when we use unobscured
segments. We speculate that this behavior is well explained if most of the reported frequencies
are related to inner clouds (within 1pc), following Kepler orbits under the gravitational field
of the SMBH.
