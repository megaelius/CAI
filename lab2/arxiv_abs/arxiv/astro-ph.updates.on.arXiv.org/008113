There are few warp kinematic models able to characterise both structure and kinematics. These models
are needed to shed some light to the lopsidedness and twisting of the stellar warp already seen in
gas and dust. We use the vertical information from the Gaia Data Release 2 up to G=20 mag to study the
structure of the Galactic warp, the related vertical motions and the relation with age. We analyse
two populations up to galactocentric distances of R=16 kpc, a young bright sample formed by OB stars
and an older one of Red Giant Branch stars. We use two methods (ngc PCM and LonKin) based on the Gaia
observables, together with 2D maps of positions and proper motions in the Galactic plane. We indeed
confirm the age dependency of the Galactic warp, both in positions and kinematics, being the height
of the Galactic warp ~ 0.2 kpc for the OB sample and ~1.0 kpc for the Red Giant Branch at R=14 kpc. Both
methods find that the onset radius is 12<R<13 kpc for the OB sample and 10<R<11 kpc for the RGB. From
the RGB sample, we find from R>10 kpc the line-of-nodes twists away from the Sun-anticentre line
towards galactic azimuths ~180-200 deg increasingly with radius. Also, the RGB sample reveals
a slightly lopsided stellar warp with |Z(down)|- |Z(up)|~250 pc. The line of maximum of proper motions
in latitude is systematically offset from the line-of-nodes estimated from the spatial data, which
our warp models predict as a kinematic signature of lopsidedness. We also show a prominent wave-like
pattern of a bending mode different in the OB and RGB samples. Both positions and kinematics also
reveal substructures that might not be related to the large scale Galactic warp or to the bending
mode. GaiaDR2 reveals a high degree of complexity that triggers the need for complex kinematic models,
flexible enough to combine wave-like patterns and an S-shaped lopsided and twisted warp [abridged].
