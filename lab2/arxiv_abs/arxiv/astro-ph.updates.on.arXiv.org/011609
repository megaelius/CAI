Constraining parameters such as the initial mass function high-mass slope and the frequency of
type Ia supernovae is of critical importance in the ongoing quest to understand galactic physics
and create realistic hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate a method to precisely
determine these using individual chemical abundances from a large set of stars, coupled with some
estimate of their ages. Inference is performed via the simple chemical evolution model Chempy in
a Bayesian framework, marginalizing over each star's specific interstellar medium parameters,
including an element-specific `model error' parameter to account for inadequacies in our model.
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) methods are used to sample the posterior function, made possible
by replacing Chempy with a trained neural network at negligible error. The approach is tested using
data from both Chempy and the IllustrisTNG simulation, showing sub-percent agreement between
inferred and true parameters using data from up to 1600 individual stellar abundances. For IllustrisTNG,
strongest constraints are obtained from metal ratios, competitive with those from other methods
including star counts. Analysis using a different set of nucleosynthetic yields shows that incorrectly
assumed yield models can give non-negligible bias in the derived parameters; this is reduced by
our model errors, which further show how well the yield tables match data. We also find a significant
bias from analyzing only a small set of stars, as is often done in current analyses. The method can
be easily applied to observational data, giving tight bounds on key galactic parameters from chemical
abundances alone.
