Based on tensions between the early and late time cosmology, we proposed a double valued cosmological
constant which could undergo a phase transition in its history. It is named "double-$\Lambda$ Cold
Dark Matter": $\Lambda\Lambda$CDM. An occurred phase transition results in (micro-) structures
for the dark sector with a proper (local) interaction. In this paper, inspired by the physics of critical
phenomena, we study a simplified model such that the cosmological constant has two values before
a transition redshift, $z_t$, and afterwards it becomes single-valued. We consider the background
data set including BAO distances and Riess et al.'s $H_0$ data point, with and without a prior on $\Omega_m\,h^2$,
we could show our model can lessen the $H_0$ tension by $\Delta\chi_{total}^2=-7.49$ and $\Delta\chi_{total}^2=-7.15$
respectively with two more free parameters. We also examine our model to check if we can reduce the
$f\,\sigma_8$ tension. In the presence of Planck 2015 prior on $\Omega_m\,h^2$ it will be shown
that our model is much better than $\Lambda$CDM by $\Delta\chi_{total}^2=-7.26$ where $H_0$ tension
is removed while we do not have any better results for $f\,\sigma_8$. If we relax the prior on $\Omega_m$
then our model behaves in a very non-trivial way. Our $1\,\sigma$ likelihood has two extrema at $z_t\sim
0$ and one around $z_t\sim 2.25$. The former corresponds to $\Delta\chi_{total}^2=-6.74$ while
$\Delta\chi_{H_0}^2=-6.93$ and $\Delta\chi_{f\,\sigma_8}^2=+0.74$ which means we could only
solve $H_0$ tension without any success on $f\,\sigma_8$ one. However for the latter case, $z_t=2.25$,
we have $\Delta\chi_{total}^2=-5.26$ while $\Delta\chi_{H_0}^2=-2.89$ and $\Delta\chi_{f\,\sigma_8}^2=-2.01$.
This case shows we can reduce both tensions together which is a hint for our idea that the dark sector
underwent a phase transition and it may have (micro-) structures.
