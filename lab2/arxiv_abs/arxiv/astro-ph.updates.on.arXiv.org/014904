We present the discovery with Keck of the extremely infrared (IR) luminous transient AT 2017gbl,
coincident with the Northern nucleus of the luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) IRAS 23436+5257. Our
extensive multi-wavelength follow-up spans ~900 days, including photometry and spectroscopy
in the optical and IR, and (very long baseline interferometry) radio and X-ray observations. Radiative
transfer modelling of the host galaxy spectral energy distribution and long-term pre-outburst
variability in the mid-IR indicate the presence of a hitherto undetected dust obscured active galactic
nucleus (AGN). The optical and near-IR spectra show broad 2000 km/s hydrogen, He I and O I emission
features that decrease in flux over time. Radio imaging shows a fast evolving compact source of synchrotron
emission spatially coincident with AT 2017gbl. We infer a lower limit for the radiated energy of
7.3 x 10^50 erg from the IR photometry. An extremely energetic supernova would satisfy this budget,
but is ruled out by the radio counterpart evolution. Instead, we propose AT 2017gbl is related to
an accretion event by the central supermassive black hole, where the spectral signatures originate
in the AGN broad line region and the IR photometry is consistent with re-radiation by polar dust.
Given the fast evolution of AT 2017gbl, we deem a tidal disruption event (TDE) of a star a more plausible
scenario than a dramatic change in the AGN accretion rate. This makes AT 2017gbl the third TDE candidate
to be hosted by a LIRG, in contrast to the so far considered TDE population discovered at optical wavelengths
and hosted preferably by post-starburst galaxies.
