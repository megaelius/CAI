We have modelled the near-infrared to radio images of the Crab Nebula with a Bayesian SED model to
simultaneously fit its synchrotron, interstellar and supernova dust emission. We infer an interstellar
dust extinction map with an average $A_{\text{V}}$=1.08$\pm$0.38 mag, consistent with a small
contribution (<22%) to the Crab's overall infrared emission. The Crab's supernova dust mass is
estimated to be between 0.032 and 0.049 M$_{\odot}$ (for amorphous carbon grains) with an average
dust temperature $T_{\text{dust}}$=41$\pm$3K, corresponding to a dust condensation efficiency
of 8-12%. This revised dust mass is up to an order of magnitude lower than some previous estimates,
which can be attributed to our different interstellar dust corrections, lower SPIRE flux densities,
and higher dust temperature than were used in previous studies. The dust within the Crab is predominantly
found in dense filaments south of the pulsar, with an average V-band dust extinction of $A_{\text{V}}$=0.20-0.39
mag, consistent with recent optical dust extinction studies. The modelled synchrotron power-law
spectrum is consistent with a radio spectral index $\alpha_{\text{radio}}$=0.297$\pm$0.009
and an infrared spectral index $\alpha_{\text{IR}}$=0.429$\pm$0.021. We have identified a millimetre
excess emission in the Crab's central regions, and argue that it most likely results from two distinct
populations of synchrotron emitting particles. We conclude that the Crab's efficient dust condensation
(8-12%) provides further evidence for a scenario where supernovae can provide substantial contributions
to the interstellar dust budgets in galaxies.
