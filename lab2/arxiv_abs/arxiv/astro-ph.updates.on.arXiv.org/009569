We present comprehensive observations and analysis of the energetic H-stripped SN 2016coi (a.k.a.
ASASSN-16fp), spanning the $\gamma$-ray through optical and radio wavelengths, acquired within
the first hours to $\sim$420 days post explosion. Our campaign confirms the identification of He
in the SN ejecta, which we interpret to be caused by a larger mixing of Ni into the outer ejecta layers.
From the modeling of the broad bolometric light curve we derive a large ejecta mass to kinetic energy
ratio ($M_{\rm{ej}}\sim 4-7\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$, $E_{\rm{k}}\sim 7-8\times 10^{51}\,\rm{erg}$).
The small [\ion{Ca}{ii}] \lam\lam7291,7324 to [\ion{O}{i}] \lam\lam6300,6364 ratio ($\sim$0.2)
observed in our late-time optical spectra is suggestive of a large progenitor core mass at the time
of collapse. We find that SN 2016coi is a luminous source of X-rays ($L_{X}>10^{39}\,\rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$
in the first $\sim100$ days post explosion) and radio emission ($L_{8.5\,GHz}\sim7\times 10^{27}\,\rm{erg\,s^{-1}Hz^{-1}}$
at peak). These values are in line with those of relativistic SNe (2009bb, 2012ap). However, for
SN 2016coi we infer substantial pre-explosion progenitor mass-loss with rate $\dot M \sim (1-2)\times
10^{-4}\,\rm{M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$ and a sub-relativistic shock velocity $v_{sh}\sim0.15c$,
in stark contrast with relativistic SNe and similar to normal SNe. Finally, we find no evidence for
a SN-associated shock breakout $\gamma$-ray pulse with energy $E_{\gamma}>2\times 10^{46}\,\rm{erg}$.
While we cannot exclude the presence of a companion in a binary system, taken together, our findings
are consistent with a massive single star progenitor that experienced large mass loss in the years
leading up to core-collapse, but was unable to achieve complete stripping of its outer layers before
explosion.
