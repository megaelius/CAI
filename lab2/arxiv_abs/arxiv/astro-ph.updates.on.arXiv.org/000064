In this article, we present a galactic gravitational model of three degrees of freedom (3D), in order
to study and reveal the character of the orbits of the stars, in a binary stellar system composed of
a primary quiet or active galaxy and a small satellite companion galaxy. Our main dynamical analysis
will be focused on the behavior of the primary galaxy. We investigate in detail the regular or chaotic
nature of motion, in two different cases: (i) the time-independent model in both 2D and 3D dynamical
systems and (ii) the time-evolving 3D model. Our numerical calculations indicate that the percentage
of the chaotic orbits increases when the primary galaxy has a dense and massive nucleus. The presence
of the dense galactic core also increases the stellar velocities near the center of the galaxy. Moreover,
for small values of the distance R between the two bodies, low-energy stars display chaotic motion,
near the central region of the galaxy, while for larger values of the distance R, the motion in active
galaxies is entirely regular for low-energy stars. Our simulations suggest that in galaxies with
a satellite companion, the chaotic nature of motion is not only a result of the galactic interaction
between the primary galaxy and its companion, but also a result caused by the presence of the dense
nucleus in the core of the primary galaxy. Theoretical arguments are presented in order to support
and interpret the numerically derived outcomes. Furthermore, we follow the 3D evolution of the
primary galaxy, when mass is transported adiabatically from the disk to the nucleus. Our numerical
results are in satisfactory agreement with observational data obtained from the M51-type binary
stellar systems. A comparison between the present research and similar and earlier work is also
made.
