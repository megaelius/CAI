The dynamical evolution of triple stellar systems could give rise to the formation of compact binaries
and induce binary mergers. Common envelope (CE) evolution, which plays a major role in the evolution
of compact binary systems, can similarly play a key role in the evolution of triples. Here we use hydrodynamical
simulations coupled with few-body dynamics to provide the first detailed models of triple common
envelope (TCE) evolution. We focus on the circumstellar case, where the envelope of an evolved giant
engulfs a compact binary orbiting the giant (inner-binary), which then in-spirals into the core
of the evolved star. Through our exploratory modeling we find several possible outcomes of such
TCE: (1) The merger of the binary inside the third star's envelope; (2) The binary disruption of the
in-spiraling binary following its plunge, leading to a chaotic triple dynamics of the stellar-core
and the two components of the former disrupted binary. The chaotic evolution typically leads to
the in-spiral and merger of at least one of the former binary components with the core, and sometimes
to the ejection of the second, or alternatively its further now-binary common-envelope evolution.
The in-spiral in TCE leads to overall slower in-spiral, larger mass ejection and the production
of more aspherical remnant, compared with a corresponding binary case of similar masses, due to
the energy/momentum extraction from the inner-binary. We expect TCE to play a key role in producing
various types of stellar-mergers and unique compact binary systems, and potentially induce transient
electromagnetic and gravitational-wave sources.
