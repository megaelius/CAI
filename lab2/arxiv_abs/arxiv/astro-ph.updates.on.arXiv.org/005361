We report spectroscopic results from our 40-orbit $Hubble~Space~Telescope$ slitless grism spectroscopy
program observing the 20 densest CARLA candidate galaxy clusters at $1.4 < z < 2.8$. These candidate
rich structures, among the richest and most distant known, were identified on the basis of $[3.6]-[4.5]$
color from a $408~$hr multi-cycle $Spitzer$ program targeting $420$ distant radio-loud AGN. We
report the spectroscopic confirmation of $16$ distant structures at $1.4 < z < 2.8$ associated with
the targeted powerful high-redshift radio-loud AGN. We also report the serendipitous discovery
and spectroscopic confirmation of seven additional structures at $0.87 < z < 2.12$ not associated
with the targeted radio-loud AGN. We find that $10^{10} - 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$ member galaxies
of our confirmed CARLA structures form significantly fewer stars than their field counterparts
at all redshifts within $1.4\leq z\leq 2$. We also observe higher star-forming activity in the structure
cores up to $z = 2$, finding similar trends as cluster surveys at slightly lower redshifts ($1.0 <
z < 1.5$). By design, our efficient strategy of obtaining just two grism orbits per field only obtains
spectroscopic confirmation of emission-line galaxies. Deeper spectroscopy will be required
to study the population of evolved, massive galaxies in these (forming) clusters. Lacking multi-band
coverage of the fields, we adopt a very conservative approach of calling all confirmations "structures",
although we note that a number of features are consistent with some of them being bona fide galaxy
clusters. Together, this survey represents a unique and large homogenous sample of spectroscopically
confirmed structures at high redshifts, potentially more than doubling the census of confirmed,
massive clusters at $z > 1.4$.
