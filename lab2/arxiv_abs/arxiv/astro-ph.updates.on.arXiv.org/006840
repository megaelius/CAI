We study the total and dark matter (DM) density profiles as well as their correlations for a sample
of 15 high-mass galaxy clusters by extending our previous work on several clusters from Newman et
al. Our analysis focuses on 15 CLASH X-ray-selected clusters that have high-quality weak- and strong-lensing
measurements from combined Subaru and {\em Hubble Space Telescope} observations. The total density
profiles derived from lensing are interpreted based on the two-phase scenario of cluster formation.
In this context, the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) forms in the first dissipative phase, followed
by a dissipationless phase where baryonic physics flattens the inner DM distribution. This results
in the formation of clusters with modified DM distribution and several correlations between characteristic
quantities of the clusters. We find that the central DM density profiles of the clusters are strongly
influenced by baryonic physics as found in our earlier work. The inner slope of the DM density for
the CLASH clusters is found to be flatter than the Navarro--Frenk--White profile, ranging from
$\alpha=0.30$ to $0.79$. We examine correlations of the DM density slope $\alpha$ with the effective
radius $R_\mathrm{e}$ and stellar mass $M_\mathrm{e}$ of the BCG, finding that these quantities
are anti-correlated with a Spearman correlation coefficient of $\sim -0.6$. We also study the correlation
between $R_\mathrm{e}$ and the cluster halo mass $M_{500}$, and the correlation between the total
masses inside 5\,kpc and 100\,kpc. We find that these quantities are correlated with Spearman coefficients
of $0.68$ and $0.64$, respectively. These observed correlations are in support of the physical
picture proposed by Newman et al.
