The total number and luminosity function of the population of dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way (MW)
provide important constraints on the nature of the dark matter and on the astrophysics of galaxy
formation at low masses. However, only a partial census of this population exists because of the
flux limits and restricted sky coverage of existing Galactic surveys. We combine the sample of satellites
recently discovered by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) survey with the satellites found in Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 9 (together these surveys cover nearly half the sky) to estimate the
total luminosity function of satellites down to $M_{\rm V}=0$. We apply a new Bayesian inference
method in which we assume that the radial distribution of satellites follows that of subhaloes selected
according to their peak maximum circular velocity. We find that there should be at least $142^{+53}_{-34}$
($1\sigma$ CL) satellites brighter than $M_{\rm V}=0$ within $300$ kpc of the Sun. As a result of
our use of new data and better simulations, and a more robust statistical method, we infer a much smaller
population of satellites than reported in previous studies using earlier SDSS data only; we also
address an underestimation of the uncertainties in earlier work by accounting for discreteness
effects. We find that the inferred number of faint satellites depends only weakly on the assumed
mass of the MW halo and we provide scaling relations to extend our results to different assumed halo
masses and outer radii. We predict that half of our estimated total satellite population of the MW
should be detected by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).
