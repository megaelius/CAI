To better understand the LBV phenomenon, we analyze multi-epoch and multi-wavelength spectra
and photometry of R71. Pre-outburst spectra are analyzed with the radiative transfer code CMFGEN
to determine the star's fundamental stellar parameters. During quiescence, R71 has an effective
temperature of $T_\mathrm{{eff}} = 15\,500~K$ and a luminosity of log$(L_*/L_{\odot})$ = 5.78
and is thus a classical LBV, but at the lower luminosity end of this group. We determine its mass-loss
rate to $4.0 \times 10^{-6}~M_{\odot}~$yr$^{-1}$. We present R71's spectral energy distribution
from the near-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared during its present outburst. Mid-infrared observations
suggest that we are witnessing dust formation and grain evolution. Semi-regular oscillatory variability
in the star's light curve is observed during the current outburst. Absorption lines develop a second
blue component on a timescale twice that length. The variability may consist of one (quasi-)periodic
component with P ~ 425/850 d with additional variations superimposed. During its current S Doradus
outburst, R71 occupies a region in the HR diagram at the high-luminosity extension of the Cepheid
instability strip and exhibits similar irregular variations as RV Tau variables. LBVs do not pass
the Cepheid instability strip because of core evolution, but they develop comparable cool, low-mass,
extended atmospheres in which convective instabilities may occur. As in the case of RV Tau variables,
the occurrence of double absorption lines with an apparent regular cycle may be due to shocks within
the atmosphere and period doubling may explain the factor of two in the lengths of the photometric
and spectroscopic cycles.
