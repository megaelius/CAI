There is increasing evidence that globular clusters retain sizeable black hole populations at
present day. This is supported by dynamical simulations of cluster evolution, which have unveiled
the spatial distribution and mass spectrum of black holes in clusters across cosmic age. However,
the black hole populations of young, high metallicity clusters remain unconstrained. The black
holes hosted by these clusters are expected to rapidly mass segregate early in their evolutionary
history, forming central cusps of hundreds to thousands of black holes. Here, we argue that the host
young cluster can accumulate gas from its dense surroundings, from which the black hole cusp members
can accrete at highly enhanced rates. Their collective accretion luminosity can be substantial
and provides a novel observational constraint for nearby young massive clusters. We test this hypothesis
by performing 3D hydrodynamic simulations where we embed discretized potentials, representing
our black holes, within the core potential of a massive cluster. This system moves supersonically
with respect to a gaseous medium from which it accretes. We study the accretion of this black hole
cusp for different cusp populations and determine the integrated accretion luminosity of the black
hole cusp. We apply our results to the young massive clusters of the Antennae Galaxies and find that
a typical cusp accretion luminosity should be in excess of $\approx 10^{40}\,{\rm ergs\,\,s^{-1}}$.
We argue that no strong candidates of this luminous signal have been observed, and constrain the
cusp population of a typical cluster in the Antennae Galaxies to $\lesssim10-2\times10^2$ $10\,M_\odot$
black holes. This is in conflict with predictions of dynamical simulations, which suggest that
these systems should harbor several hundred to thousands of black holes, and we explore the reasons
for this discrepancy in our conclusions.
