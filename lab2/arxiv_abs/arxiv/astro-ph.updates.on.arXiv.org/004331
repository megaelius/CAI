We jointly analyze Bolocam Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect and Chandra X-ray data for a set of 45 clusters
to derive gas density and temperature profiles without using spectroscopic information. The sample
spans the mass and redshift range $3 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot} \le M_{500} \le 25 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$
and $0.15\le z \le 0.89$. We define cool-core (CC) and non-cool core (NCC) subsamples based on the
central X-ray luminosity, and 17/45 clusters are classified as CC. In general, the profiles derived
from our analysis are found to be in good agreement with previous analyses, and profile constraints
beyond $r_{500}$ are obtained for 34/45 clusters. In approximately 30% of the CC clusters our analysis
shows a central temperature drop with a statistical significance of $>3\sigma$; this modest detection
fraction is due mainly to a combination of coarse angular resolution and modest S/N in the SZ data.
Most clusters are consistent with an isothermal profile at the largest radii near $r_{500}$, although
9/45 show a significant temperature decrease with increasing radius. The sample mean density profile
is in good agreement with previous studies, and shows a minimum intrinsic scatter of approximately
10% near $0.5 \times r_{500}$. The sample mean temperature profile is consistent with isothermal,
and has an intrinsic scatter of approximately 50% independent of radius. This scatter is significantly
higher compared to earlier X-ray-only studies, which find intrinsic scatters near 10%, likely
due to a combination of unaccounted for non-idealities in the SZ noise, projection effects, and
sample selection.
