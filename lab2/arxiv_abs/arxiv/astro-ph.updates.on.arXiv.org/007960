(Abridged) The existence of an extended neutral hydrogen exosphere around small planets can be
used as an evidence for the presence of water in their lower atmosphere but, to date, such feature
has not been securely detected in rocky exoplanets. Planetary exospheres can be observed using
transit spectroscopy of the Lyman-$\alpha$ line, which is limited mainly by interstellar medium
absorption in the core of the line, and airglow contamination from the geocorona when using low-orbit
space telescopes. Our objective is to assess the detectability of the neutral hydrogen exosphere
of an Earth-like planet transiting a nearby M dwarf using Lyman-$\alpha$ spectroscopy and provide
the necessary strategies to inform future observations. The spatial distribution in the upper
atmosphere is provided by an empirical model of the geocorona, and we assume a velocity distribution
based on radiative pressure as the main driver in shaping the exosphere. We compute the excess absorption
in the stellar Lyman-$\alpha$ line while in transit, and use realistic estimates of the uncertainties
involved in observations to determine the observability of the signal. We found that the signal
in Lyman-$\alpha$ of the exosphere of an Earth-like exoplanet transiting M dwarfs with radii between
0.1 and 0.6 R$_\odot$ produces an excess absorption between 50 and 600 ppm. The Lyman-$\alpha$ flux
of stars decays exponentially with distance because of interstellar medium absorption, which
is the main observability limitation. Other limits are related to the stellar radial velocity and
instrumental setup. The excess absorption in Lyman-$\alpha$ is observable using LUVOIR/LUMOS
in M dwarfs up to a distance of $\sim$15 pc. The analysis of noise-injected data suggests that it would
be possible to detect the exosphere of an Earth-like planet transiting TRAPPIST-1 within 20 transits.
