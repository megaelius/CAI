The formation of sunspots requires the concentration of magnetic flux near the surface. The negative
magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI) might be a possible mechanism for accomplishing this, but
it has mainly been studied in simple systems using an isothermal equation of state without a natural
free surface. We study NEMPI in a stratified Cartesian mean-field model where turbulence effects
are parameterized. We use an ideal equation of state and include radiation transport, which establishes
selfconsistently a free surface. We use a Kramers-type opacity with adjustable exponents chosen
such that the deeper layers are approximately isentropic. No convection is therefore possible
in this model, allowing us to study NEMPI with radiation in isolation. We restrict ourselves to two-dimensional
models. We use artificially enhanced mean-field coefficients to allow NEMPI to develop, making
it therefore possible to study the reason why it is much harder to excite in the presence of radiation.
NEMPI yields moderately strong magnetic flux concentrations a certain distance beneath the surface
where optical depth is unity. The instability is oscillatory and in the form of upward travelling
waves. This seems to be a new effect that has not been found in earlier models without radiative transport.
The horizontal wavelength is about ten times smaller than what has been found previously in more
idealized isothermal models. In our models, NEMPI saturates at field strengths too low to explain
sunspots. Furthermore, the structures appear too narrow and too far beneath the surface to cause
significant brightness variations at the radiative surface. We speculate that the failure to reproduce
effects resembling sunspots may be related to the neglect of convection.
