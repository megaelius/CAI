HC$_3$N is an ubiquitous molecule in interstellar environments, from external galaxies, to Galactic
interstellar clouds, star forming regions, and planetary atmospheres. Observations of its rotational
and vibrational transitions provide important information on the physical and chemical structure
of the above environments. We present the most complete global analysis of the spectroscopic data
of HC$_3$N. We have recorded the high-resolution infrared spectrum from 450 to 1350 cm$^{-1}$,
a region dominated by the intense $\nu_5$ and $\nu_6$ fundamental bands, located at 660 and 500 cm$^{-1}$,
respectively, and their associated hot bands. Pure rotational transitions in the ground and vibrationally
excited states have been recorded in the millimetre and sub-millimetre regions in order to extend
the frequency range so far considered in previous investigations. All the transitions from the
literature and from this work involving energy levels lower than 1000 cm$^{-1}$ have been fitted
together to an effective Hamiltonian. Because of the presence of various anharmonic resonances,
the Hamiltonian includes a number of interaction constants, in addition to the conventional rotational
and vibrational l-type resonance terms. The data set contains about 3400 ro-vibrational lines
of 13 bands and some 1500 pure rotational lines belonging to 12 vibrational states. More than 120
spectroscopic constants have been determined directly from the fit, without any assumption deduced
from theoretical calculations or comparisons with similar molecules. An extensive list of highly
accurate rest frequencies has been produced to assist astronomical searches and data interpretation.
These improved data, have enabled a refined analysis of the ALMA observations towards Sgr B2(N2).
