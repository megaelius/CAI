We observed the Crab pulsar with the 43-m telescope in Green Bank, WV over a timespan of 15 months.
In total we obtained 100 hours of data at 1.2 GHz and seven hours at 330 MHz, resulting in a sample of
about 95000 giant pulses (GPs). This is the largest sample, to date, of GPs from the Crab pulsar taken
with the same telescope and backend and analyzed as one data set. We calculated power-law fits to
amplitude distributions for main pulse (MP) and interpulse (IP) GPs, resulting in indices in the
range of 2.1-3.1 for MP GPs at 1.2 GHz and in the range of 2.5-3.0 and 2.4-3.1 for MP and IP GPs at 330 MHz.
We also correlated the GPs at 1.2 GHz with GPs from the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT), which
were obtained simultaneously at a higher frequency (8.9 GHz) over a span of 26 hours. In total, 7933
GPs from the 43-m telescope at 1.2 GHz and 39900 GPs from the GBT were recorded during these contemporaneous
observations. At 1.2 GHz, 236 (3%) MP GPs and 23 (5%) IP GPs were detected at 8.9 GHz, both with zero
chance probability. Another 15 (4%) low-frequency IP GPs were detected within one spin period of
high-frequency IP GPs, with a chance probability of 9%. This indicates that the emission processes
at high and low radio frequencies are related, despite significant pulse profile shape differences.
The 43-m GPs were also correlated with Fermi gamma-ray photons to see if increased pair production
in the magnetosphere is the mechanism responsible for GP emission. A total of 92022 GPs and 393 gamma-ray
photons were used in this correlation analysis. No significant correlations were found between
GPs and gamma-ray photons. This indicates that increased pair production in the magnetosphere
is likely not the dominant cause of GPs. Possible methods of GP production may be increased coherence
of synchrotron emission or changes in beaming direction.
