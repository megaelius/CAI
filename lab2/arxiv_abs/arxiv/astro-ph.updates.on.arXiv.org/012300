ALMA has been operating since 2011, but has not yet been populated with the full suite of intended
frequency bands. In particular, ALMA Band 2 (67-90 GHz) is the final band in the original ALMA band
definition to be approved for production. We aim to produce a wideband, tuneable, sideband-separating
receiver with 28 GHz of instantaneous bandwidth per polarisation operating in the sky frequency
range 67-116 GHz. Our design anticipates new ALMA requirements following the recommendations
in the 2030 ALMA Development Roadmap. The cryogenic cartridge is designed to be compatible with
the ALMA Band 2 cartridge slot, where the coldest components -- the feedhorns, orthomode transducers,
and cryogenic low noise amplifiers -- operate at a temperature of 15 K. We use multiple simulation
methods and tools to optimise our designs for both the passive optics and the active components.
The cryogenic cartridge interfaces with a room temperature cartridge hosting the local oscillator
(LO) and the downconverter module. This warm cartridge is largely based on GaAs semiconductor technology
and is optimised to match the cryogenic receiver bandwidth with the required instantaneous LO tuning
range. Our collaboration has designed, fabricated, and tested multiple technical solutions for
each of the components, producing a state-of-the-art receiver covering the full ALMA Band 2 & 3 atmospheric
window. The receiver is suitable for deployment on ALMA in the coming years, and is capable of dual-polarisation,
sideband-separating observations in intermediate frequency bands spanning 4-18 GHz, for a total
of 28 GHz on-sky bandwidth per polarisation channel. We conclude that the 67-116 GHz wideband implementation
for ALMA Band 2 is now feasible, and this receiver is a compelling instrumental upgrade that will
enhance observational capabilities and scientific reach.
