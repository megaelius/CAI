The Hubble Tarantula Treasury Project (HTTP) has provided an unprecedented photometric coverage
of the entire star-burst region of 30 Doradus down to the half Solar mass limit. We use the deep stellar
catalogue of HTTP to identify all the pre--main-sequence (PMS) stars of the region, i.e., stars
that have not started their lives on the main-sequence yet. The photometric distinction of these
stars from the more evolved populations is not a trivial task due to several factors that alter their
colour-magnitude diagram positions. The identification of PMS stars requires, thus, sophisticated
statistical methods. We employ Machine Learning Classification techniques on the HTTP survey
of more than 800,000 sources to identify the PMS stellar content of the observed field. Our methodology
consists of 1) carefully selecting the most probable low-mass PMS stellar population of the star-forming
cluster NGC 2070, 2) using this sample to train classification algorithms to build a predictive
model for PMS stars, and 3) applying this model in order to identify the most probable PMS content
across the entire Tarantula Nebula. We employ Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine
classifiers to categorise the stars as PMS and Non-PMS. The Random Forest and Support Vector Machine
provided the most accurate models, predicting about 20,000 sources with a candidateship probability
higher than 50 percent, and almost 10,000 PMS candidates with a probability higher than 95 percent.
This is the richest and most accurate photometric catalogue of extragalactic PMS candidates across
the extent of a whole star-forming complex.
