Aim: Our aim is to obtain high-accuracy measurements of the physical and orbital parameters of two
evolved eclipsing binary systems, and to use these measurements to study their evolutionary status.
We also aim to derive distances to the systems by using a surface brightness - colour relation and
compare these distances with the measurements provided by GAIA. Methods: We measured the physical
and orbital parameters on both systems based on V-band and I-band photometry from OGLE, near-infrared
photometry obtained with the NTT telescope and the instrument SOFI, as well as high-resolution
spectra obtained at ESO 3.6m/HARPS and Clay 6.5/MIKE spectrographs. The light curves and radial-velocity
curves were analysed with the Wilson-Devinney code. Results: We analysed two double-lined eclipsing
binary systems OGLE-BLG-ECL-23903 and OGLE-BLG-ECL-296596 from the Optical Gravitational Lensing
Experiment (OGLE) catalogue. Both systems have a configuration of two well-detached giant stars.
The masses of the components ofOGLE-BLG-ECL-123903 are M_1= 2.045 $\pm$ 0.027 and M_2=2.074 $\pm$
0.023 $M_\odot$ and the radii are R_1=9.540 $\pm$ 0.049 and R_2=9.052 $\pm$ 0.060 $R_\odot$. For
OGLE-BLG-ECL-296596, the masses are M_1=1.093 $\pm$ 0.015 and M_2=1.125 $\pm$ 0.014 $M_\odot$,
while the radii are R_1=18.06 $\pm$ 0.28 and R_2=29.80 $\pm$ 0.33 $R_\odot$. Evolutionary status
was discussed based on the isochrones and evolutionary tracks from PARSEC and MESA codes. The ages
of the systems were establishes to be around 1.3 Gyr for the OGLE-BLG-ECL-123903 and 7.7 Gyr for the
OGLE-BLG-ECL-296596. We also determined the distance to both systems. For OGLE-BLG-ECL-123903
this is equal to d=2.95 $\pm$ 0.06 (stat.) $\pm$ 0.07 (syst.) kpc, while for the OGLE-BLG-ECL-296596
it is d=5.68 $\pm$ 0.07 (stat.) $\pm$ 0.14 (syst.) kpc. This is the first analysis of its kind for these
unique evolved eclipsing binary systems.
