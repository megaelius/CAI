We present a new prospective analysis of deep multi-band imaging with the James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST). In this work, we investigate the recovery of high-redshift $5<z<12$ galaxies through extensive
image simulations of accepted JWST programs such as CEERS in the EGS field and HUDF GTO. We introduce
complete samples of $\sim300,000$ galaxies with stellar masses $\log(M_*/M_\odot)>6$ and redshifts
$0<z<15$, as well as galactic stars, into realistic mock NIRCam, MIRI and HST images to properly
describe the impact of source blending. We extract the photometry of the detected sources as in real
images and estimate the physical properties of galaxies through spectral energy distribution
fitting. We find that the photometric redshifts are primarily limited by the availability of blue-band
and near-infrared medium-band imaging. The stellar masses and star-formation rates are recovered
within $0.25$ and $0.3$ dex respectively, for galaxies with accurate photometric redshifts. Brown
dwarfs contaminating the $z>5$ galaxy samples can be reduced to $<0.01$ arcmin$^{-2}$ with a limited
impact on galaxy completeness. We investigate multiple high-redshift galaxy selection techniques
and find the best compromise between completeness and purity at $5<z<10$ using the full redshift
posterior probability distributions. In the EGS field, the galaxy completeness remains higher
than $50\%$ for $m_\text{UV}<27.5$ sources at all redshifts, and the purity is maintained above
$80$ and $60\%$ at $z\leq7$ and $10$ respectively. The faint-end slope of the galaxy UV luminosity
function is recovered with a precision of $0.1-0.25$, and the cosmic star-formation rate density
within $0.1$ dex. We argue in favor of additional observing programs covering larger areas to better
constrain the bright end.
