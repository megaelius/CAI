MAGIC, a system of two imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, achieves its best performance
under dark conditions, i.e. in absence of moonlight or twilight. Since operating the telescopes
only during dark time would severely limit the duty cycle, observations are also performed when
the Moon is present in the sky. Here we develop a dedicated Moon-adapted analysis to characterize
the performance of MAGIC under moonlight. We evaluate energy threshold, angular resolution and
sensitivity of MAGIC under different background light levels, based on Crab Nebula observations
and tuned Monte Carlo simulations. This study includes observations taken under non-standard
hardware configurations, such as reducing the camera photomultiplier tubes gain by a factor ~1.7
(Reduced HV settings) with respect to standard settings (Nominal HV) or using UV-pass filters to
strongly reduce the amount of moonlight reaching the cameras of the telescopes. The Crab Nebula
spectrum is correctly reconstructed in all the studied illumination levels, that reach up to 30
times brighter than under dark conditions. The main effect of moonlight is an increase in the analysis
energy threshold and in the systematic uncertainties on the flux normalization. The sensitivity
degradation is constrained to be below 10%, within 15-30% and between 60 and 80% for Nominal HV, Reduced
HV and UV-pass filter observations, respectively. No worsening of the angular resolution was found.
Thanks to observations during moonlight, the maximal duty cycle of MAGIC can be increased from ~18%,
under dark nights only, to up to ~40% in total with only moderate performance degradation.
