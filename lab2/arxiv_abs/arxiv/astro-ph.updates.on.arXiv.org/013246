We use cosmological, magnetohydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies from the Auriga
project to study their enrichment with rapid neutron capture (r-process) elements. We implement
a variety of enrichment models from both binary neutron star mergers and rare core-collapse supernovae.
We focus on the abundances of (extremely) metal-poor stars, most of which were formed during the
first ~Gyr of the Universe in external galaxies and later accreted onto the main galaxy. We find that
the majority of metal-poor stars are r-process enriched in all our enrichment models. Neutron star
merger models result in a median r-process abundance ratio which increases with metallicity, whereas
the median trend in rare core-collapse supernova models is approximately flat. The scatter in r-process
abundance increases for models with longer delay times or lower rates of r-process producing events.
Our results are nearly perfectly converged, in part due to the mixing of gas between mesh cells in
the simulations. Additionally, different Milky Way-mass galaxies show only small variation in
their respective r-process abundance ratios. Current (sparse and potentially biased) observations
of metal-poor stars in the Milky Way seem to prefer rare core-collapse supernovae over neutron star
mergers as the dominant source of r-process elements at low metallicity, but we discuss possible
caveats to our models. Dwarf galaxies which experience a single r-process event early in their history
show highly enhanced r-process abundances at low metallicity, which is seen both in observations
and in our simulations. We also find that the elements produced in a single event are mixed with ~10^8
Msun of gas relatively quickly, distributing the r-process elements over a large region.
