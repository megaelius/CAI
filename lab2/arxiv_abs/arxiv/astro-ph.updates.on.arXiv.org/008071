We study the impact of numerical parameters on the properties of cold dark matter haloes formed in
collisionless cosmological simulations. We quantify convergence in the median spherically-averaged
circular velocity profiles for haloes of widely varying particle number, as well as in the statistics
of their structural scaling relations and mass functions. In agreement with prior work focused
on single haloes, our results suggest that cosmological simulations yield robust halo properties
for a wide range of softening parameters, $\epsilon$, provided: 1) $\epsilon$ is not larger than
a "convergence radius", $r_{\rm conv}$, which is dictated by 2-body relaxation and determined
by particle number, and 2) a sufficient number of timesteps are taken to accurately resolve particle
orbits with short dynamical times. Provided these conditions are met, median circular velocity
profiles converge to within $\approx 10$ per cent for radii beyond which the local 2-body relaxation
timescale exceeds the Hubble time by a factor $\kappa\equiv t_{\rm relax}/t_{\rm H}> 0.177$, with
better convergence attained for higher $\kappa$. We provide analytic estimates of $r_{\rm conv}$
that build on previous attempts in two ways: first, by highlighting its explicit (but weak) softening-dependence
and, second, by providing a simpler criterion in which $r_{\rm conv}$ is determined entirely by
the mean inter-particle spacing, $l$; for example, $< 10$ per cent convergence in circular velocity
for $r> 0.05\,l$. We show how these analytic criteria can be used to assess convergence in structural
scaling relations for dark matter haloes as a function of their mass or maximum circular speed, $V_{\rm
max}$. The convergence radius is smaller than the virial radius, $r_{200}$, of all haloes resolved
with $\geq 32$ particles, a result that we verify explicitly using our suite of simulations. [Abridged]
