We characterize the radial and angular variance of the Hubble flow in the COMPOSITE sample of 4534
galaxies, on scales in which much of the flow is in the nonlinear regime. Independent of any cosmological
assumptions other than the existence of a suitably averaged linear Hubble law, we find with decisive
Bayesian evidence (ln B >> 5) that the Hubble constant averaged in spherical radial shells
is closer to its asymptotic value when referred to the rest frame of the Local Group rather than the
standard rest frame of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Angular averages reveal a dipole
structure in the Hubble flow, whose amplitude in the two rest frames changes in correlation with
the monopole variation within spheres of radius 30/h - 62/h Mpc in markedly different ways, with
99.99% confidence. The angular map of Hubble flow variation is found to coincide with that of the
residual CMB temperature dipole in the Local Group rest frame, with correlation coefficient -0.92.
The combined results of the monopole and dipole variations do not support the standard kinematic
interpretation of the motion of the Local Group in response to the clustering dipole, but are consistent
with a foreground non-kinematic anisotropy in the distance-redshift relation of 0.5% on scales
up to 65/h Mpc. Effectively, the differential expansion of space produced by nearby nonlinear structures
of local voids and denser walls and filaments cannot be reduced to a local boost. This hypothesis
suggests a reinterpretation of bulk flows, which may potentially impact on calibration of supernovae
distances, anomalies associated with large angles in the CMB anisotropy spectrum, and the dark
flow inferred from the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. It is consistent with recent studies
that find evidence for a non-kinematic dipole in the distribution of distant radio sources.
