We discuss the detection in the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS) of two objects in Neptune's
distant 9:1 mean motion resonance at semimajor axis $a\approx 130$~au. Both objects are securely
resonant on 10 Myr timescales, with one securely in the 9:1 resonance's leading asymmetric libration
island and the other in either the symmetric or trailing asymmetric island. These two objects are
the largest semimajor axis objects known with secure resonant classifications, and their detection
in a carefully characterized survey allows for the first robust population estimate for a resonance
beyond 100~au. The detection of these two objects implies a population in the 9:1 resonance of $1.1\times10^4$
objects with $H_r<8.66$ ($D \gtrsim 100$~km) on similar orbits, with 95\% confidence range of $\sim0.4-3\times10^4$.
Integrations over 4 Gyr of an ensemble of clones chosen from within the orbit fit uncertainties for
these objects reveal that they both have median resonance occupation timescales of $\sim1$~Gyr.
These timescales are consistent with the hypothesis that these two objects originate in the scattering
population but became transiently stuck to Neptune's 9:1 resonance within the last $\sim1$~Gyr
of solar system evolution. Based on simulations of a model of the current scattering population,
we estimate the expected resonance sticking population in the 9:1 resonance to be 1000--5000 objects
with $H_r<8.66$; this is marginally consistent with the OSSOS 9:1 population estimate. We conclude
that resonance sticking is a plausible explanation for the observed 9:1 population, but we also
discuss the possibility of a primordial 9:1 population, which would have interesting implications
for the Kuiper belt's dynamical history.
