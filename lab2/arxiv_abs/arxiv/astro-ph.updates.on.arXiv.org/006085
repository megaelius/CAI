We present $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O data as the next major release for the CHaMP project,
an unbiased sample of Galactic molecular clouds in $l$ = 280$^{\circ}$-300$^{\circ}$. From a radiative
transfer analysis, we self-consistently compute 3D cubes of optical depth, excitation temperature,
and column density for $\sim$300 massive clumps, and update the $I_{\rm CO}$-dependent CO$\rightarrow$H$_2$
conversion law of Barnes et al (2015). For $N$ $\propto$ $I^p$, we find $p$ = 1.92$\pm$0.05 for the
velocity-resolved conversion law aggregated over all clumps. A practical, integrated conversion
law is $N_{\rm CO}$ = (4.0$\pm$0.3)$\times$10$^{19}$m$^{-2}$ $I_{\rm CO}^{1.27\pm0.02}$,
confirming an overall 2$\times$ higher total molecular mass for Milky Way clouds, compared to the
standard $X$ factor. We use these laws to compare the kinematics of clump interiors with their foreground
$^{12}$CO envelopes, and find evidence that most clumps are not dynamically uniform: irregular
portions seem to be either slowly accreting onto the interiors, or dispersing from them. We compute
the spatially-resolved mass accretion/dispersal rate across all clumps, and map the local flow
timescale. While these flows are not clearly correlated with clump structures, the inferred accretion
rate is a statistically strong function of the local mass surface density $\Sigma$, suggesting
near-exponential growth or loss of mass over effective timescales $\sim$30-50 Myr. At high enough
$\Sigma$, accretion dominates, suggesting gravity plays an important role in both processes.
If confirmed by numerical simulations, this sedimentation picture would support arguments for
long clump lifetimes mediated by pressure confinement, with a terminal crescendo of star formation,
suggesting a resolution to the 40-yr-old puzzle of the dynamical state of molecular clouds and their
low star formation efficiency.
