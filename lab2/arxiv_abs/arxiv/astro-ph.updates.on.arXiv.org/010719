Cassini spacecraft observations of Saturn in 2006 revealed south polar cloud shadows, the common
interpretation of which was initiated by Dyudina et al. (2008, Science 319, 1801) who suggested
they were being cast by concentric cloud walls, analogous to the physically and optically thick
eyewalls of a hurricane. Here we use radiative transfer results of Sromovsky et al. (2019, Icarus,
doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2019.113398), in conjunction with Monte Carlo calculations and physical
models, to show that this interpretation is almost certainly wrong because (1) optically thick
eyewalls should produce very bright features in the poleward direction that are not seen, while
the moderately brighter features that are seen appear in the opposite direction, (2) eyewall shadows
should be very dark, but the observed shadows create only 5-10\% I/F variations, (3) radiation transfer
modeling of clouds in this region have detected no optically thick wall clouds and no significant
variation in pressures of the model cloud layers, and (4) there is an alternative explanation that
is much more consistent with observations. The most plausible scenario is that the shadows near
87.9 deg S and 88.9 deg S are both cast by overlying translucent aerosol layers from edges created
by step decreases in their optical depths, the first in the stratospheric layer at the 50 mbar level
and the second in a putative diphosphine layer near 350 mbar, with optical depths reduced at the poleward
side of each step by 0.15 and 0.12 respectively at 752 nm. These steps are sufficient to create shadows
of roughly the correct size and shape, falling mainly on the underlying ammonia ice layer near 900
mbar, and to create the bright features we call antishadows.
