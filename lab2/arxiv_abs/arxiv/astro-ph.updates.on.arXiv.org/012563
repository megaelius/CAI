We address the generation of initial conditions (ICs) for GRAMSES, a code for nonlinear general
relativistic (GR) $N$-body cosmological simulations recently introduced in Ref. [1]. GRAMSES
adopts a constant mean curvature slicing with a minimal distortion gauge, where the linear growth
rate is scale-dependent, and the standard method for realising initial particle data is not straightforwardly
applicable. A new method is introduced, in which the initial positions of particles are generated
from the displacement field realised for a matter power spectrum as usual, but the velocity is calculated
by finite-differencing the displacement fields around the initial redshift. In this way, all the
information required for setting up the initial conditions is drawn from three consecutive input
matter power spectra, and additional assumptions such as scale-independence of the linear growth
factor and growth rate are not needed. We implement this method in a modified 2LPTic code, and demonstrate
that in a Newtonian setting it can reproduce the velocity field given by the default 2LPTic code with
subpercent accuracy. We also show that the matter and velocity power spectra of the initial particle
data generated for GRAMSES simulations using this method agree very well with the linear-theory
predictions in the particular gauge used by GRAMSES. Finally, we discuss corrections to the finite
difference calculation of the velocity when radiation is present, as well as additional corrections
implemented in GRAMSES to ensure consistency. This method can be applied in ICs generation for GR
simulations in generic gauges, and simulations of cosmological models with scale-dependent linear
growth rate.
