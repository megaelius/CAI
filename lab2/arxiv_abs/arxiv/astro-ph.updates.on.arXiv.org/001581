There is growing evidence of a higher intrinsic fraction of broad absorption line quasars (BALQSOs)
than that obtained in optical surveys, on which most previous X-ray studies of BALQSOs have focused.
Here we present Chandra observations of 18 BALQSOs at $z\sim2$, selected from a near-infrared (2MASS)
sample, where the BALQSO fraction is likely to be close to the intrinsic fraction. We measure photon
indices using the stacked spectra of the optically-faint ($i-K_s\geq 2.3$ mag) and optically-bright
($i-K_s < 2.3$ mag) samples to be $\Gamma \simeq 1.5$--$2.1$. We constrain their intrinsic column
density by modelling the X-ray fractional hardness ratio, finding a mean column density of $3.5\times10^{22}$
\cmsq\ assuming neutral absorption. We incorporate SDSS optical measurements (rest frame UV)
to study the broadband spectral index between the X-ray and UV bands, and compare this to a large sample
of normal quasars. We estimate that the optically-faint BALQSOs are X-ray weaker than the optically-bright
ones, and the entire sample of BALQSOs are intrinsically X-ray weak when compared to normal AGN.
Correcting for magnification of X-ray emission via gravitational lensing by the central black
hole viewed at large inclination angles makes these BALQSOs even more intrinsically X-ray weak.
Finally, we estimate AGN kinetic feedback efficiencies of a few percent for an X-ray wind of $0.3c$
in high-ionization BALQSOs. Combined with energy carried by low-ionization BALQSOs and UV winds,
the total kinetic energy in BALQSOs can be sufficient to provide AGN kinetic feedback required to
explain the co-evolution between black holes and host galaxies.
