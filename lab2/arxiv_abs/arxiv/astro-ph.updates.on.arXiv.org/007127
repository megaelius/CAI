Aims. We study the kinematically distinct components in two early-type galaxies NGC 448 and NGC
4365 aided by integral-field observations with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on
the Very Large Telescope. We aim to measure the brightness profiles, kinematics, and stellar population
properties of the peculiar kinematic structures in these galaxies and shed light on their true nature
and formation mechanism. Methods. We use a kinematic decomposition technique to separate the individual
contributions to the spectra of the two distinct kinematic components observed at each spatial
position in the field of view. By folding back the outcome of a photometric decomposition we reduce
the intrinsic degeneracies in recovering the kinematics and the best-fitting stellar spectral
templates. Finally, by extracting the Lick line-strength indices for the individual components
and fitting them to single stellar population models we derive their ages, metallicities, and {\alpha}/Fe
overabundances. Results. The two kinematically decoupled stellar components in NGC 448 have similar
ages, but different chemical compositions. The distinct kinematic feature in NGC 448 has a nearly
exponential surface-brightness light profile, dominates in the innermost ~ 10", is smaller in
size, and is very likely an embedded counter-rotating disk as also indicated by its kinematics.
It has higher metallicity than the main galaxy stellar body and lower {\alpha}/Fe overabundance.
By contrast, we do not find evidence for true decoupling in the two distinct kinematic components
in NGC 4365. This confirms earlier work suggesting that the kinematically distinct core is likely
not a separate dynamical structure, but most certainly likely a projection effect stemming from
the orbital structure of this galaxy that was previously found to be intrinsically triaxial in shape.
