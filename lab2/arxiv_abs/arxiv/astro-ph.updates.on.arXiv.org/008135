The hydrodynamic version of the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code, MG, has been employed to perform
3D simulations of the formation of collapsing cold clumps on the scale of a few parsecs, inside a larger
cloud complex. The diffuse atomic initial condition consists of a stationary, thermally unstable,
200pc diameter spherical cloud in pressure equilibrium with low density surroundings. The diffuse
atomic cloud was seeded with 10% density perturbations at the finest initial grid level (0.29pc)
around n_H=1.1cm^-3 and evolved with self-gravity included from the outset. No magnetic field
was imposed. Resimulation of a region of this simulation at higher resolution (down to 0.039pc),
shows that the thermal instability dynamically forms sheets and filaments. The natural width of
the filaments is 0.1-0.3pc. Following this, clumps grow at the intersections of filaments with
size-scales of around 5pc and aspect ratios around unity. Imposed on the entire potential well of
the cloud, the FellWalker routine finds 21 distinct clumps. The properties of these clumps are in
agreement with clumps observed in molecular clouds. Given their positions, at the interconnections
of the filamentary network, many show evidence of infalling linear structure. Not all are gravitationally
bound, but the convergent nature of the infall and increasing central density in each suggest they
are highly-likely to form stars. Further simulation of the most massive clump reveals the final
gravitational collapse of the clump, to resolved levels of density six orders of magnitude higher
than the initial condition (i.e. to n_H>10^6cm^-3). The clumps within the cloud provide a realistic
initial condition that can be used to study feedback in 1) individual clumps, 2) interacting clumps
and 3) across the entire molecular cloud complex. Future work will consider the effects of cluster
feedback in each of these three scenarios.
