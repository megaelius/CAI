We present a semi-empirical, largely model-independent approach for estimating Galactic birth
radii, r_birth, for Milky Way disk stars. The technique relies on the justifiable assumption that
a negative radial metallicity gradient in the interstellar medium (ISM) existed for most of the
disk lifetime. Stars are projected back to their birth positions according to the observationally
derived age and [Fe/H] with no kinematical information required. Applying our approach to the AMBRE:HARPS
and HARPS-GTO local samples, we show that we can constrain the ISM metallicity evolution with Galactic
radius and cosmic time, [Fe/H]_ISM(r, t), by requiring a physically meaningful r_birth distribution.
We find that the data are consistent with an ISM radial metallicity gradient that flattens with time
from ~-0.15 dex/kpc at the beginning of disk formation, to its measured present-day value (-0.07
dex/kpc). We present several chemo-kinematical relations in terms of mono-r_birth populations.
One remarkable result is that the kinematically hottest stars would have been born locally or in
the outer disk, consistent with thick disk formation from the nested flares of mono-age populations
and predictions from cosmological simulations. This phenomenon can be also seen in the observed
age-velocity dispersion relation, in that its upper boundary is dominated by stars born at larger
radii. We also find that the flatness of the local age-metallicity relation (AMR) is the result of
the superposition of the AMRs of mono-r_birth populations, each with a well-defined negative slope.
The solar birth radius is estimated to be 7.3+-0.6 kpc, for a current Galactocentric radius of 8 kpc.
