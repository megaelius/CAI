The coldest brown dwarf, WISE 0855, is the closest known planetary-mass, free-floating object
and has a temperature nearly as cold as the solar system gas giants. Like Jupiter, it is predicted
to have an atmosphere rich in methane, water, and ammonia, with clouds of volatile ices. WISE 0855
is faint at near-infrared wavelengths and emits almost all its energy in the mid-infrared. Skemer
et al. 2016 presented a spectrum of WISE 0855 from 4.5-5.1 micron (M band), revealing water vapor
features. Here, we present a spectrum of WISE 0855 in L band, from 3.4-4.14 micron. We present a set
of atmosphere models that include a range of compositions (metallicities and C/O ratios) and water
ice clouds. Methane absorption is clearly present in the spectrum. The mid-infrared color can be
better matched with a methane abundance that is depleted relative to solar abundance. We find that
there is evidence for water ice clouds in the M band spectrum, and we find a lack of phosphine spectral
features in both the L and M band spectra. We suggest that a deep continuum opacity source may be obscuring
the near-infrared flux, possibly a deep phosphorous-bearing cloud, ammonium dihyrogen phosphate.
Observations of WISE 0855 provide critical constraints for cold planetary atmospheres, bridging
the temperature range between the long-studied solar system planets and accessible exoplanets.
JWST will soon revolutionize our understanding of cold brown dwarfs with high-precision spectroscopy
across the infrared, allowing us to study their compositions and cloud properties, and to infer
their atmospheric dynamics and formation processes.
