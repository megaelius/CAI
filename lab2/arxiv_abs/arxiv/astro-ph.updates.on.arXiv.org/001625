We present the first 3-dimensional, fully compressible gas-dynamics simulations in $4\pi$ geometry
of He-shell flash convection with proton-rich fuel entrainment at the upper boundary. This work
is motivated by the insufficiently understood observed consequences of the H-ingestion flash
in post-AGB stars (Sakurai's object) and metal-poor AGB stars. Our investigation is focused on
the entrainment process at the top convection boundary and on the subsequent advection of H-rich
material into deeper layers, and we therefore ignore the burning of the proton-rich fuel in this
study. We find that, for our deep convection zone, coherent convective motions of near global scale
appear to dominate the flow. These very large-scale motions have significant impact upon the flow
behavior where the H-rich fluid is entrained. Additionally, we establish the quantitative dependence
of the entrainment rate on grid resolution. With our numerical technique and with the relatively
stiff convective boundaries that we find to apply for H-entrainment into He-shell flash convection
zones, simulations with $1024^3$ cells or more are required to reach a numerical fidelity appropriate
for the problem. However, only the result from the $1536^3$ simulation provides evidence that we
do reach convergence with regard to the entrainment rate. Our results demonstrate that our method,
which is described in detail, can provide quantitative results related to entrainment and convective
boundary mixing in deep stellar interior environments with very stiff convective boundaries.
For the representative case we study in detail, we find an entrainment rate of $4.38 \pm 1.48 \times
10^{-13}M_\odot\mathrm{/s}$.
