The IllustrisTNG project is a new suite of cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of
galaxy formation performed with the moving-mesh code Arepo and updated models for feedback physics.
Here we introduce the first two simulations of the series, TNG100 and TNG300, and quantify the stellar
mass content of about 4000 massive galaxy groups and clusters ($10^{13} \leq M_{\rm 200c}/M_{\rm
sun} \leq 10^{15}$) at recent times ($z \leq 1$). We find that, while Milky Way-sized haloes contain
about 95% of their diffuse stars within the inner tenth of their virial radii, this fraction drops
to just 50% for the richest galaxy clusters. These clusters have half of their total stellar mass
bound to satellite galaxies, with the other half being associated with the central galaxy and the
diffuse intra-cluster light (ICL). The exact ICL fraction depends sensitively on the definition
of a central galaxy's mass and varies in our most massive clusters between 20 to 40% of the total stellar
mass. Haloes of $5\times 10^{14}M_{\rm sun}$ and above have more diffuse stellar mass outside 100
kpc than within 100 kpc, with power-law slopes of the radial density distribution as shallow as the
dark matter's ( $-3.5 < \alpha_{\rm 3D} < -3$). We confirm that total halo mass is a very good predictor
of stellar mass, and vice versa: the stellar mass measured within 30 kpc scales as $\propto (M_{\rm
500c})^{0.49}$ with a $\sim 0.12$ dex scatter. The 3D stellar half mass radii of massive galaxies
fall too on a tight ($\sim$0.16 dex scatter) power-law relation with halo mass, $r^{\rm stars}_{\rm
0.5} \propto (M_{\rm 500c})^{0.53}$. Even more fundamentally, we find that halo mass alone is a
good predictor for the whole stellar mass profiles of massive galaxies beyond the inner few kpc,
and we show how on average these can be precisely recovered given a single mass measurement of the
galaxy or its halo.
