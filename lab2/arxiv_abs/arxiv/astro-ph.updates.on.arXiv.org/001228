This paper analyses the behaviour of the gas-to-dust mass ratio (G/D) of local Universe galaxies
over a large metallicity range. We combine three samples: the Dwarf Galaxy Survey, the KINGFISH
survey and a subsample from Galametz et al. (2011) totalling 126 galaxies, covering a 2 dex metallicity
range, with 30% of the sample with 12+log(O/H) < 8.0. The dust masses are homogeneously determined
with a semi-empirical dust model, including submm constraints. The atomic and molecular gas masses
are compiled from the literature. Two XCO are used to estimate molecular gas masses: the Galactic
XCO, and a XCO depending on the metallicity (as Z^{-2}). Correlations with morphological types,
stellar masses, star formation rates and specific star formation rates are discussed. The trend
between G/D and metallicity is empirically modelled using power-laws (slope of -1 and free) and
a broken power-law. We compare the evolution of the G/D with predictions from chemical evolution
models. We find that out of the five tested galactic parameters, metallicity is the galactic property
driving the observed G/D. The G/D versus metallicity relation cannot be represented by a power-law
with a slope of -1 over the whole metallicity range. The observed trend is steeper for metallicities
lower than ~ 8.0. A large scatter is observed in the G/D for a given metallicity, with a dispersion
of 0.37 dex in metallicity bins of ~0.1 dex. The broken power-law reproduces best the observed G/D
and provides estimates of the G/D that are accurate to a factor of 1.6. The good agreement of the G/D
and its scatter with the three tested chemical evolution models shows that the scatter is intrinsic
to galactic properties, reflecting the different star formation histories, dust destruction
efficiencies, dust grain size distributions and chemical compositions across the sample. (abriged)
