Einstein's General Relativity (GR) is possibly one of the greatest intellectual achievements
ever conceived by the human mind. In fact, over the last century, GR has proven to be an extremely successful
theory, with a well established experimental footing. However, the discovery of the late-time
cosmic acceleration, which represents a new imbalance in the governing gravitational field equations,
has forced theorists and experimentalists to question whether GR is the correct relativistic theory
of gravitation, and has spurred much research in modified gravity, where extensions of the Hilbert-Einstein
action describe the gravitational field. In this review, we perform a detailed theoretical and
phenomenological analysis of two largely explored extensions of $f(R)$ gravity, namely: (i) the
hybrid metric-Palatini theory; (ii) and modified gravity with curvature-matter couplings. Relative
to the former, it has been established that both metric and Palatini versions of $f(R)$ gravity possess
interesting features but also manifest severe drawbacks. A hybrid combination, containing elements
from both of these formalisms, turns out to be very successful in accounting for the observed phenomenology
and avoids some drawbacks of the original approaches. Relative to the curvature-matter coupling
theories, these offer interesting extensions of $f(R)$ gravity, where the explicit nonminimal
couplings between an arbitrary function of the scalar curvature $R$ and the Lagrangian density
of matter, induces a non-vanishing covariant derivative of the energy-momentum tensor. We extensively
explore both theories in a plethora of applications, namely, the weak-field limit, galactic and
extragalactic dynamics, cosmology, stellar-type compact objects, irreversible matter creation
processes and the quantum cosmology of a specific curvature-matter coupling theory.
