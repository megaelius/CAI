We present new 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu m$ Spitzer phase curves for the highly irradiated hot Jupiter WASP-33b
and the unusually dense Saturn-mass planet HD 149026b. As part of this analysis, we develop a new
variant of pixel level decorrelation that is effective at removing intrapixel sensitivity variations
for long observations (>10 hours) where the position of the star can vary by a significant fraction
of a pixel. Using this algorithm, we measure eclipse depths, phase amplitudes, and phase offsets
for both planets at 3.6 $\mu m$ and 4.5 $\mu m$. We use a simple toy model to show that WASP-33b's phase
offset, albedo, and heat recirculation efficiency are largely similar to those of other hot Jupiters
despite its very high irradiation. On the other hand, our fits for HD 149026b prefer a very high albedo
and an unusually high recirculation efficiency. We also compare our results to predictions from
general circulation models, and find that while neither are a good match to the data, the discrepancies
for HD 149026b are especially large. We speculate that this may be related to its high bulk metallicity,
which could lead to enhanced atmospheric opacities and the formation of reflective cloud layers
in localized regions of the atmosphere. We then place these two planets in a broader context by exploring
relationships between the temperatures, albedos, heat transport efficiencies, and phase offsets
of all planets with published thermal phase curves. We find a striking relationship between phase
offset and irradiation temperature--the former drops with increasing temperature until around
3400 K, and rises thereafter. Although some aspects of this trend are mirrored in the circulation
models, there are notable differences that provide important clues for future modeling efforts.
