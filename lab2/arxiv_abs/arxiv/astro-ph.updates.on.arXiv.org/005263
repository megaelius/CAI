In this paper we review a new scenario for the formation of massive black hole seeds that relies on
multi-scale gas inflows initiated by the merger of massive gas-rich galaxies at $z > 6$, where gas
has already achieved solar composition. Hydrodynamical simulations undertaken to explore our
scenario show that supermassive, gravitationally bound gaseous disks, weighing a billion solar
masses and of a few pc in size, form in the nuclei of merger remnants in less than $10^5$ yr. These could
later produce a supermassive protostar or supermassive star at their center via various mechanisms.
Moreover, we present a new analytical model, based on angular momentum transport in mass-loaded
gravitoturbulent disks. This naturally predicts that a nuclear disk accreting at rates exceeding
$1000 M_{\odot}$/yr, as seen in the simulations, is stable against fragmentation irrespective
of its metallicity. This is at variance with conventional direct collapse scenarios, which require
the suppression of gas cooling in metal-free protogalaxies for gas collapse to take place. Such
high accretion rates reflect the high free-fall velocities in massive halos appearing at $z < 10$,
and occur naturally as a result of the efficient angular momentum loss provided by mergers. We discuss
the implications of our scenario on the observed population of high-z quasars and on its evolution
to lower redshifts using a semi-analytical galaxy formation model. Finally, we consider the intriguing
possibility that the secondary gas inflows in the unstable disks might drive gas to collapse into
a supermassive black hole directly via the General Relativistic radial instability. Such {\it
dark collapse} route could generate gravitational wave emission detectable via the future Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). [Abridged]
