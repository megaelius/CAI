Modern cosmological simulations model the universe with increasing sophistication and at higher
spatial and temporal resolutions. These enhancements permit detailed comparisons between the
simulation outputs and real observational data. Recent projects such as Illustris are capable
of producing simulated images that are comparable to those obtained from local surveys. This paper
tests how well Illustris achieves this goal across a diverse population of galaxies using visual
morphologies derived from Galaxy Zoo citizen scientists. Morphological classifications provided
by volunteers for simulated galaxies are compared with similar data for a compatible sample of images
drawn from the SDSS Legacy Survey. This paper investigates how simple morphological characterization
by human volunteers asked to distinguish smooth from featured systems differs between simulated
and real galaxy images. Differences are identified, which are likely due to the limited resolution
of the simulation, but which could be revealing real differences in the dynamical evolution of populations
of galaxies in the real and model universes. Specifically, for stellar masses $M_{\star}\lesssim10^{11}M_{\odot}$,
a larger proportion of Illustris galaxies that exhibit disk-like morphology or visible substructure,
relative to their SDSS counterparts. Toward higher masses, simulated and observed galaxies converge
and exhibit similar morphology distributions. The stellar mass threshold indicated by this divergent
behavior confirms recent works using parametric measures of morphology from Illustris simulated
images. When $M_{\star}\gtrsim10^{11}M_{\odot}$, the Illustris dataset contains fewer galaxies
that classifiers regard as unambiguously featured. These results suggest that comparison between
the detailed properties of observed and simulated galaxies, even when limited to reasonably massive
systems, may be misleading.
