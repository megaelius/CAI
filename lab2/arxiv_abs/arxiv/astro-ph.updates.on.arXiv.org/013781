We present proper motion measurements for more than $0.55$ million main-sequence stars, by comparing
astrometric positions of matched stars between the multi-band imaging datasets from the Hyper
Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey and the SDSS Stripe 82. In doing this we use $3$ million galaxies to recalibrate
the astrometry and set up a common reference frame between the two catalogues. The exquisite depth
and the nearly $12$ years of time baseline between HSC and SDSS enable high-precision measurements
of statistical proper motions for stars down to $i\simeq 24$. A validation of our method is demonstrated
by the agreement with the $Gaia$ proper motions, to the precision better than $0.1$ mas yr$^{-1}$.
To retain the precision, we make a correction of the subtle effects due to the differential chromatic
refraction in the SDSS images based on the comparison with the $Gaia$ proper motions against colour
of stars, which is validated using the SDSS spectroscopic quasars. Combining with the photometric
distance estimates for individual stars based on the precise HSC photometry, we show a significant
detection of the net proper motions for stars in each bin of distance out to $100$ kpc. The two-component
tangential velocities after subtracting the apparent motions due to our own motion display rich
phase-space structures including a clear signature of the Sagittarius stream in the halo region
of distance range $[10,\ 35]$ kpc. We also measure the tangential velocity dispersion in the distance
range $5-20$ kpc and find that the data are consistent with a constant isotropic dispersion of $80\pm
10\ {\rm km/s}$. More distant stars appear to have random motions with respect to the Galactic centre
on average.
