In typical environments of star-forming clouds, converging supersonic turbulence generates
shock-compressed regions, and can create strongly-magnetized sheet-like layers. Numerical
MHD simulations show that within these post-shock layers, dense filaments and embedded self-gravitating
cores form via gathering material along the magnetic field lines. As a result of the preferred-direction
mass collection, a velocity gradient perpendicular to the filament major axis is a common feature
seen in simulations. We show that this prediction is in good agreement with recent observations
from the CARMA Large Area Star Formation Survey (CLASSy), from which we identified several filaments
with prominent velocity gradients perpendicular to their major axes. Highlighting a filament
from the northwest part of Serpens South, we provide both qualitative and quantitative comparisons
between simulation results and observational data. In particular, we show that the dimensionless
ratio $C_v \equiv {\Delta v_h}^2/(GM/L)$, where $\Delta v_h$ is half of the observed perpendicular
velocity difference across a filament, and $M/L$ is the filament's mass per unit length, can distinguish
between filaments formed purely due to turbulent compression and those formed due to gravity-induced
accretion. We conclude that the perpendicular velocity gradient observed in the Serpens South
northwest filament can be caused by gravity-induced anisotropic accretion of material from a flattened
layer. Using synthetic observations of our simulated filaments, we also propose that a density-selection
effect may explain observed subfilaments (one filament breaking into two components in velocity
space) as reported in Dhabal et al. (2018).
