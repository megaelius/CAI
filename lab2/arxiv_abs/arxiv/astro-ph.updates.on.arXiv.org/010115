Asteroseismology can provide joint constraints on masses and radii of individual stars. While
this approach has been extensively tested for red giant branch (RGB) stars, it has been more difficult
to test for helium core-burning red-clump (RC) giants because of the lack of fundamental calibrators.
To provide independent mass estimates, we utilize a number of widely used horizontal-branch (HB)
models in the literature, and derive photometric masses from a comparison with $griBVI_CJHK_s$
photometry. Our selected models disagree with each other on the predicted mass-luminosity-temperature
relation. We adopt first-order corrections on colors and magnitudes to minimize the dispersion
between different models by forcing models to match the observed location in the solar-metallicity
cluster M67. Even for these calibrated models, however, the internal consistency between models
deteriorates at higher metallicities, and photometric masses become smaller than asteroseismic
masses, as seen from metal-rich field RC stars with Gaia parallaxes. Similarly, the average photometric
mass for metal-rich NGC 6791 stars ranges from $0.7\ M_\odot$ to $1.1\ M_\odot$, depending on the
specific set of models employed. An ensemble average of the photometric masses ($0.88\pm0.16\
M_\odot$) in NGC 6791 is marginally consistent with the asteroseismic mass ($1.16\pm0.04\ M_\odot$).
There is a clear tension between the masses that one would predict from photometry for metal-rich
field RC stars, asteroseismic masses, and those that would be expected from the ages of stars in the
Galactic disk populations and canonical RGB mass loss. We conclude that standard RC models need
to be re-examined in light of these powerful new data sets.
