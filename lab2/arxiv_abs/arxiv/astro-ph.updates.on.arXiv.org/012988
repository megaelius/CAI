In circumstellar gas, the complex organic molecule methanol has been found almost exclusively
around young stellar objects, and is thus regarded as a signpost of recent star formation. Here we
report the first probable detection of methanol around an evolved high-mass star, in the complex
circumstellar environment around the Luminous Blue Variable $\eta$ Carinae, while using ALMA
to investigate molecular cloud conditions traced by CO (2-1) in an orbit phase of the massive binary
preceding the 2020 periastron. Favoring methanol over a $^{13}$CS alternative, the emission originates
from hot ($T_{\rm{gas}} \simeq$ 700 K) material, $\sim$2$''$ (0.02 pc) across, centered on the
dust-obscured binary in contrast to the CO which traces inner layers of the extended massive equatorial
torus, and is accompanied by prominent absorption in a cooler ($T_{\rm{gas}} \simeq$ 110 K) layer
of gas. We also report detections of water in $Herschel$/HIFI observations at 557 GHz and 988 GHz.
The methanol abundance is several to 50 times higher than observed towards several lower mass stars,
while water abundances are similar to those observed in cool, dense molecular clouds. The very high
methanol:water abundance ratio in the core of $\eta$ Carinae may suggest methanol formation processes
similar to Fischer-Tropsch-type catalytic reactions on dust grains. These observations prove
that complex molecule formation can occur in the chemically evolved environments around massive
stars in the end stages of their evolution, given sufficient gas densities and shielding conditions
as may occur in material around massive interacting companions and merger remnants.
