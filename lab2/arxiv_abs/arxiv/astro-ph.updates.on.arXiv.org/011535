We present mid-infrared photometry and measured global properties of the 100 largest galaxies
in the sky, including the Magellanic Clouds, Local Group galaxies M31 and M33, the Fornax and Virgo
Galaxy Cluster giants, and many of the most spectacular Messier objects (e.g., M51 and M83). This
is the first release of a larger catalog of extended sources as imaged in the mid-infrared, called
the WISE Extended Source Catalogue (WXSC). In this study we measure their global attributes, including
integrated flux, surface brightness and radial distribution. The largest of the large are the LMC,
SMC and the Andromeda Galaxy, which are also the brightest mid-infrared galaxies in the sky. We interrogate
the large galaxies using WISE colors, which serve as proxies for four general types of galaxies:
bulge-dominated spheroidals, intermediate semi-quiescent disks, star-forming spirals, and
AGN-dominated. The colors reveal a tight "sequence" that spans 5 magnitudes in W2-W3 color, ranging
from early to late-types, and low to high star-forming activity; we fit the functional form given
by: ${\rm (W1-W2)} = [0.015 \times {\rm e}^{ \frac{{\rm (W2-W3)}}{1.38} }] - 0.08$. Departures
from this sequence may reveal nuclear, starburst, and merging events. Physical properties and
luminosity attributes are computed, notably the diameter, aggregate stellar mass and the dust-obscured
star formation activity. We introduce the 'pinwheel' diagram which depicts physical properties
with respect to the median value observed for WISE galaxies in the local universe. Utilized with
the WXSC, this diagram will delineate between different kinds of galaxies, identifying those with
similar star formation and structural properties. Finally, we present the mid-infrared photometry
of the 25 brightest globular clusters in the sky, including Omega Centauri, 47 Tucanae and a number
of famed night-sky targets (e.g. M 13). (Abridged)
