A link between magnetars and fast radio burst (FRB) sources has finally been established. In this
context, one of the open issues is whether/which sources of extra galactic FRBs exhibit X/gamma-ray
outbursts and whether it is correlated with radio activity. We aim to constrain possible X/gamma-ray
burst activity from one of the nearest extragalactic FRB sources currently known over a broad energy
range, by looking for bursts over a range of timescales and energies that are compatible with being
powerful flares from extragalactic magnetars. We followed up the as-yet nearest extragalactic
FRB source at a mere 149 Mpc distance, the periodic repeater FRB180916.J0158+65, during the active
phase on February 4-7, 2020, with the Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT). Taking advantage
of the combination of broad band, large effective area, and several independent detectors available,
we searched for bursts over a set of timescales from 1 ms to 1.024 s with a sensitive algorithm, that
had previously been characterised and optimised. Moreover, through simulations we studied the
sensitivity of our technique in the released energy-duration phase space for a set of synthetic
flares and assuming different energy spectra. We constrain the possible occurrence of flares in
the 1-100 keV energy band to E<10^46 erg for durations <0.1 s over several tens of ks exposure. We can
rule out the occurrence of giant flares similar to the ones that were observed in the few cases of Galactic
magnetars. The absence of reported radio activity during our observations does not allow us to make
any statements on the possible simultaneous high-energy emission.
