We study the polarization signals and physical parameters of penumbral microjets (PMJs) by using
high spatial resolution data taken in the Fe I 630 nm pair, Ca II 854.2 nm and Ca II K lines with the CRISP
and CHROMIS instruments at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. We infer their physical parameters,
such as physical observables in the photosphere and chromospheric velocity diagnostics, by different
methods, including inversions of the observed Stokes profiles with the STiC code. PMJs harbor overall
brighter Ca II K line profiles and conspicuous polarization signals in Ca II 854.2 nm, specifically
in circular polarization that often shows multiple lobes mainly due to the shape of Stokes I. They
usually overlap photospheric regions with sheared magnetic field configuration, suggesting
that magnetic reconnections could play an important role in the origin of PMJs. The discrepancy
between their low LOS velocities and the high apparent speeds reported on earlier, as well as the
existence of different vertical velocity gradients in the chromosphere, indicate that PMJs might
not be entirely related to mass motions. Instead, PMJs could be due to perturbation fronts induced
by magnetic reconnections occurring in the deep photosphere that propagate through the chromosphere.
This reconnection may be associated with current heating that produces temperature enhancements
from the temperature minimum region. Furthermore, enhanced collisions with electrons could also
increase the coupling to the local conditions at higher layers during the PMJ phase, giving a possible
explanation for the enhanced emission in the overall Ca II K profiles emerging from these transients.
