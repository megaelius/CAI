During the solar magnetic activity cycle the emergence latitudes of sunspots change, leading to
the well-known butterfly diagram. This phenomenon is poorly understood for other stars as starspot
latitudes are generally unknown. The related changes in starspot rotation rates caused by latitudinal
differential rotation can however be measured. Using the set of 3093 Kepler stars with activity
cycles identified by Reinhold et al. (2017), we aim to study the temporal change in starspot rotation
rates over magnetic activity cycles, and how this relates to the activity level, mean rotation rate,
and effective temperature of the star. We measure the photometric variability as a proxy for the
magnetic activity and the spot rotation rate in each quarter over the duration of the Kepler mission.
We phase-fold these measurements with the cycle period. We perform averages over stars with comparable
mean rotation rates and effective temperature at fixed activity-cycle phases. We detect a clear
correlation between the variation of activity level and the variation of the starspot rotation
rate. The sign and amplitude of this correlation depends on the mean stellar rotation and, to a lesser
extent, on the effective temperature. For slowly rotating stars (with periods between 15-28 days)
the starspot rotation rates are clearly anti-correlated with the level of activity during the activity
cycles. A transition is seen at periods of 10-15 days, where stars with effective temperature above
4200K instead show positive correlation. Our results can be interpreted in terms of a stellar "butterfly
diagram", but these appear different from the Sun's as the starspot rotation rates are either in
phase or anti-phase with the activity level. Alternatively, the activity cycles seen by Kepler
are short (around 2.5 years) and may therefore be secondary cycles, perhaps analogous to the solar
quasi-biennial oscillations.
