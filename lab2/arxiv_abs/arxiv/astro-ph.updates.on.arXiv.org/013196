We present multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2019ein, a High
Velocity Type Ia supernova discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC 5353 with a two day non-detection
limit. SN 2019ein exhibited some of the highest measured expansion velocities of any Type Ia supernovae,
with a Si II absorption minimum blueshifted by 24,000 km s$^{-1}$ at 14 days before peak brightness.
More unusually, we observed the emission components of the P Cygni profiles to be blueshifted upwards
of 10,000 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the host galaxy redshift before B-band maximum light. This
blueshift, among the highest in a sample of other Type Ia supernovae, is greatest at our earliest
spectroscopic epoch and subsequently decreases toward maximum light. We discuss models of progenitor
systems and explosion mechanisms that could explain these extreme absorption and emission velocities.
Radio observations beginning 14 days before B-band maximum light yield non-detections at the position
of SN 2019ein, which rules out symbiotic progenitor systems, most models of white dwarfs powering
fast optically-thick accretion winds, and optically thin shells of mass $\lesssim 10^{-6}$ M$_\odot$
at radii $< 100$ AU. Comparing our spectra to models and observations of other High Velocity Type
Ia supernovae, we find that the observational properties of SN 2019ein match those of a delayed detonation
explosion. We propose that the high velocity ejecta and blueshifted emission may be the result of
abundance enhancements due to ejecta mixing in an asymmetric explosion, or optical depth effects
in the photosphere of the ejecta at early times. These findings may provide evidence for common explosion
mechanisms and ejecta geometries among High Velocity Type Ia supernovae.
