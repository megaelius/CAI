4C 71.07 is a high-redshift blazar whose optical radiation is dominated by quasar-like nuclear
emission. We here present the results of a spectroscopic monitoring of the source to study its unbeamed
properties. We obtained 24 optical spectra at the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) and William Herschel
Telescope (WHT) and 3 near-infrared spectra at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG). They show
no evidence of narrow emission lines. The estimate of the systemic redshift from the H$\beta$ and
H$\alpha$ broad emission lines leads to $z_{\rm sys}=2.2130 \pm 0.0004$. Notwithstanding the
nearly face-on orientation of the accretion disc, the high-ionization emission lines present
large broadening as well as noticeable blueshifts, which increase with the ionizing energy of the
corresponding species. This is a clear indication of strong ionized outflows. Line broadening
and blueshift appear correlated. We applied scaling relationships to estimate the mass of the supermassive
black hole from the Balmer and C IV lines, taking into account the prescriptions to correct for outflow.
They give $M_{\rm BH} \sim 2 \times 10^9 \, M_\odot$. We derived an Eddington luminosity $L_{\rm
Edd} \sim 2.5 \times 10^{47} \rm \, erg \, s^{-1}$ $\sim L_{\rm disc}$, and a broad line region luminosity
$L_{\rm BLR} \sim 1.5 \times 10^{46} \rm \, erg \, s^{-1}$. The line fluxes do not show significant
variability in time. In particular, there is no line reaction to the jet flaring activity detected
in 2015 October and November. This implies that the jet gives no contribution to the photoionization
of the broad line region in the considered period.
