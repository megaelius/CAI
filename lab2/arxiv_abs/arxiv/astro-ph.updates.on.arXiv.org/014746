We present hitherto the largest sample of gas-phase metallicity radial gradients measured at sub-kiloparsec
resolution in star-forming galaxies in the redshift range of $z\in[1.2, 2.3]$. These measurements
are enabled by the synergy of slitless spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope near-infrared
channels and the lensing magnification from foreground galaxy clusters. Our sample consists of
76 galaxies with stellar mass ranging from 10$^7$ to 10$^{10}$ $M_\odot$, instantaneous star-formation
rate in the range of [1, 100] $M_\odot$/yr, and global metallicity [$\frac{1}{12}$, 2] solar. At
2-$\sigma$ confidence level, 15/76 galaxies in our sample show negative radial gradients, whereas
7/76 show inverted gradients. Combining ours and all other metallicity gradients obtained at similar
resolution currently available in the literature, we measure a negative mass dependence of $\Delta\log({\rm
O/H})/\Delta r~ [\mathrm{dex~kpc^{-1}}] = \left(-0.020\pm0.007\right) + \left(-0.016\pm0.008\right)
\log(M_\ast/10^{9.4} M_\odot)$ with the intrinsic scatter being $\sigma=0.060\pm0.006$ over
four orders of magnitude in stellar mass. Our result is consistent with strong feedback, not secular
processes, being the primary governor of the chemo-structural evolution of star-forming galaxies
during the disk mass assembly at cosmic noon. We also find that the intrinsic scatter of metallicity
gradients increases with decreasing stellar mass and increasing specific star-formation rate.
This increase in the intrinsic scatter is likely caused by the combined effect of cold-mode gas accretion
and merger-induced starbursts, with the latter more predominant in the dwarf mass regime of $M_\ast\lesssim10^9
M_\odot$.
