We have measured the clustering of galaxies around active galactic nuclei (AGN) for which single-epoch
virial masses of the super-massive black hole (SMBH) are available to investigate the relation
between the large scale environment of AGNs and the evolution of SMBHs. The AGN samples used in this
work were derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) observations and the galaxy samples were
from 240~deg$^{2}$ S15b data of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). The
investigated redshift range is 0.6--3.0, and the masses of the SMBHs lie in the range $10^{7.5}$--$10^{10}$~M$_{\odot}$.
The absolute magnitude of the galaxy samples reaches to $M_{\lambda 310}$ $\sim$ $-$18 at rest frame
wavelength 310~nm for the low-redshift end of the samples. More than 70\% of the galaxies in the analysis
are blue. We found a significant dependence of the cross-correlation length on redshift, which
primarily reflects the brightness dependence of the galaxy clustering. At the lowest redshifts
the cross-correlation length increases from 7~$h^{-1}$~Mpc around $M_{\lambda 310}$$ = $$-19$~mag
to $>$10~$h^{-1}$~Mpc beyond $M_{\lambda 310}$$ = $$-20$~mag. No significant dependence of the
cross-correlation length on BH mass was found for whole galaxy samples dominated by blue galaxies,
while there was an indication of BH mass dependence in the cross-correlation with red galaxies.
These results provides a picture of the environment of AGNs studied in this paper being enriched
with blue starforming galaxies, and a fraction of the galaxies are being evolved to red galaxies
along with the evolution of SMBHs in that system.
