M dwarfs, though the most abundant star in the galaxy, form only a small subset of stellar hosts with
exoplanets with measured radii and masses. In this paper we analyze the Mass-Radius (M-R) relationship
of planets around M dwarfs using M-R measurements for 24 exoplanets. In particular, we apply both
parametric and nonparametric models and compare the two different fitting methods. We also use
these methods to compare the results of the M dwarf M-R relationship with that from the Kepler sample.
Using the nonparametric method, we find that the predicted masses for the smallest and largest planets
around M dwarfs are smaller than that given by the relation fit to the Kepler data, but that the distribution
of masses for 3 Earth Radii planets does not substantially differ between the two datasets. With
future additions to the M dwarf M-R relation from TESS and instruments like the Habitable Zone Planet
Finder, we will be able to characterize these differences in more detail, which will help illuminate
the process of planetary formation and evolution around these stars. We release a publicly available
Python code called MRExo which uses the nonparametric algorithm introduced by Ning et al. (2018)
to fit the M-R relationship. Such a nonparametric fit does not assume an underlying power law fit
to the measurements and hence can be used on samples spanning large mass and radii ranges. Therefore
by not assuming a functional form, the fit is less biased. MRExo also offers a tool to predict mass
from radius posteriors, and vice versa. This functionality can help inform observational strategies
for radial velocity campaigns, such as TESS follow-up studies, as well as predict radii with microlensing
planet masses.
