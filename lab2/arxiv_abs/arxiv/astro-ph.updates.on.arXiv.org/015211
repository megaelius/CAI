GrailQuest (Gamma Ray Astronomy International Laboratory for QUantum Exploration of Space-Time)
is a mission concept based on a constellation (hundreds/thousands) of nano/micro/small-satellites
in low (or near) Earth orbits. Each satellite hosts a non-collimated array of scintillator crystals
coupled with Silicon Drift Detectors with broad energy band coverage (keV-MeV range) and excellent
temporal resolution ( below or equal 100 nanoseconds) each with effective area around 100 cm2. This
simple and robust design allows for mass-production of the satellites of the fleet. This revolutionary
approach implies a huge reduction of costs, flexibility in the segmented launching strategy, and
an incremental long-term plan to increase the number of detectors and their performance: a living
observatory for next-generation, space-based astronomical facilities. GrailQuest is conceived
as an all-sky monitor for fast localisation of high signal-to-noise ratio transients in the X/gamma-ray
band, e.g. the elusive electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave events. Robust temporal
triangulation techniques will allow unprecedented localisation capabilities, in the keV-MeV
band, of a few arcseconds or below, depending on the temporal structure of the transient event. The
ambitious ultimate goal of this mission is to perform the first experiment, in quantum gravity,
to directly probe space-time structure down to the minuscule Planck scale, by constraining or measuring
a first order dispersion relation for light in vacuo. This is obtained by detecting delays between
photons of different energies in the prompt emission of Gamma-ray Bursts.
