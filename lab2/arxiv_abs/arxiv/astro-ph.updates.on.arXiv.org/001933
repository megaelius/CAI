Relations between temperature, T, and optical depth, tau, are often used for describing the photospheric
transition from optically thick to optically thin in stellar structure models. We show that this
is well justified, but also that currently used T(tau) relations are often inconsistent with their
implementation. As an outer boundary condition on the system of stellar structure equations, T(tau)
relations have an undue effect on the overall structure of stars. In this age of precision asteroseismology,
we need to re-assess both the method for computing and for implementing T(tau) relations, and the
assumptions they rest on. We develop a formulation for proper and consistent evaluation of T(tau)
relations from arbitrary 1D or 3D stellar atmospheres, and for their implementation in stellar
structure and evolution models. We extract radiative T(tau) relations, as described by our new
formulation, from 3D simulations of convection in deep stellar atmospheres of late-type stars
from dwarfs to giants. These simulations employ realistic opacities and equation of state, and
account for line-blanketing. For comparison, we also extract T(tau) relations from 1D MARCS model
atmospheres using the same formulation. T(tau)-relations from our grid of 3D convection simulations
display a larger range of behaviours with surface gravity, compared with those of conventional
theoretical 1D hydrostatic atmosphere models. Based on this, we recommend no longer to use scaled
solar T(tau) relations. Files with T(tau) relations for our grid of simulations are made available
to the community, together with routines for interpolating in this irregular grid. We also provide
matching tables of atmospheric opacity, for consistent implementation in stellar structure models.
