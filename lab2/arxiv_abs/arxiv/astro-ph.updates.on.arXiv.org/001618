The probability distribution function (PDF) of the mass surface density is an essential characteristic
of the structure of molecular clouds or the interstellar medium in general. Observations of the
PDF of molecular clouds indicate a composition of a broad distribution around the maximum and a decreasing
tail at high mass surface densities. The first component is attributed to the random distribution
of gas which is modeled using a log-normal function while the second component is attributed to condensed
structures modeled using a simple power-law. The aim of this paper is to provide an analytical model
of the PDF of condensed structures which can be used by observers to extract information about the
condensations. The condensed structures are considered to be either spheres or cylinders with
a truncated radial density profile at cloud radius r_cl. The assumed profile is of the form rho(r)=rho_c/(1+(r/r_0)^2)^{n/2}
for arbitrary power n where rho_c and r_0 are the central density and the inner radius, respectively.
An implicit function is obtained which either truncates (sphere) or has a pole (cylinder) at maximal
mass surface density. The PDF of spherical condensations and the asymptotic PDF of cylinders in
the limit of infinite overdensity rho_c/rho(r_cl) flattens for steeper density profiles and has
a power law asymptote at low and high mass surface densities and a well defined maximum. The power
index of the asymptote Sigma^(-gamma) of the logarithmic PDF (Sigma x P(Sigma)) in the limit of high
mass surface densities is given by gamma = (n+1)/(n-1)-1 (spheres) or by gamma=n/(n-1)-1 (cylinders
in the limit of infinite overdensity).
