Higgs inflation has received a remarkable attention in the last few years due to its simplicity and
predictive power. The key point of this model is the nonminimal coupling to gravity in unitary gauge.
As such, this theory is in fact a scalar-tensor modification of gravity that needs to be studied also
below the energy scales of inflation. Motivated by this goal, we study in great analytical and numerical
detail the static and spherically symmetric solutions of the equations of motion in the presence
of standard baryonic matter, called "Higgs monopoles" and presented in \cite{monopole}. These
particlelike solutions may arise naturally in tensor-scalar gravity with mexican hat potential
and are the only globally regular asymptotically flat solutions with finite classical energy.
In the case when the parameters of the potential are taken to be the ones of the standard model, we find
that the deviations from general relativity are extremely small, especially for bodies of astrophysical
size and density. This allows to derive a simplified description of the monopole, for which the metric
inside the spherical matter distribution can be approximated by the standard metric of general
relativity. We study how the properties of these monopoles depend on the strength of the nonminimal
coupling to gravity and on the baryonic mass and compactness. An important and original result is
the existence of a mechanism of resonant amplification of the Higgs field inside the monopole that
comes into play for large nonminimal coupling. We show that this mechanism might degenerate into
divergences of the Higgs field that reveal the existence of forbidden combinations of radius and
baryonic energy density.
