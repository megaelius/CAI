Modern cosmological simulations rely heavily on feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) in
order to stave off overcooling in massive galaxies and galaxy groups and clusters. An important
independent test is whether or not the simulations capture the broad demographics of the observed
AGN population. Here, we have used the cosmo-OWLS suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations
to produce realistic synthetic catalogs of X-ray AGN out to $z$=3, with the aim of comparing the catalogs
to the observed X-ray AGN population in the XXL survey and other recent surveys. We focused on the
unabsorbed X-ray luminosity function (XLF), the Eddington ratio distribution, the black hole
mass function, and the projected clustering of X-ray AGN. To compute the unabsorbed XLF of the simulated
AGN, we used recent empirically-determined bolometric corrections. We show that the simulated
AGN sample accurately reproduces the observed XLF over 3 orders of magnitude in X-ray luminosity
in all redshift bins. To compare to the observed Eddington ratio distribution and the clustering
of AGN, we produced detailed 'XMM-Newton-detected' catalogs of the simulated AGN. This requires
the production of synthetic X-ray images extracted from light cones of the simulations that fold
in the relevant instrumental effects of XMM-Newton. We apply a luminosity- and redshift-dependent
obscuration function for the AGN and employ the same AGN detection algorithm as used for the real
XXL survey. We demonstrate that the detected population of simulated AGN reproduces the observed
Eddington ratio distribution and projected clustering from XXL quite well. We conclude that the
simulations have a broadly realistic population of AGN and that our synthetic X-ray AGN catalogs
should be useful for interpreting additional trends and as a helpful tool for quantifying AGN contamination
in galaxy group and cluster X-ray surveys.
