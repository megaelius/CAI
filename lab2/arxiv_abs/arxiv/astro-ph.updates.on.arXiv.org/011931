In the first paper of this series we examined existing methods of optical meteor trajectory estimation
and developed a novel method which simultaneously uses both the geometry and the dynamics of meteors
to constrain their trajectories. We also developed a simulator which uses an ablation model to generate
realistic synthetic meteor trajectories which we use to test meteor trajectory solvers. In this
second paper, we perform simulation validation to estimate radiant and velocity accuracy which
may be achieved by various meteor observation systems as applied to several meteor showers. For
low-resolution all-sky systems, where the meteor deceleration is generally not measurable, the
multi-parameter fit method assuming a constant velocity better reproduces the radiant and speed
of synthetic meteors. For moderate field of view systems, our novel method performs the best at all
convergence angles, while multi-parameter fit methods generally produce larger speed errors.
For high-resolution, narrow field of view systems, we find our new method of trajectory estimation
reproduces radiant and speed more accurately than all other methods tested. The ablation properties
of meteoroids are commonly found to be the limiting factor in velocity accuracy. We show that the
true radiant dispersion of meteor showers can be reliably measured with moderate field of view (or
more precise) systems provided appropriate methods of meteor trajectory estimation are employed.
Finally, we compare estimated and real angular radiant uncertainty and show that for the solvers
tested the real radiant error is on average underestimated by a factor of two.
