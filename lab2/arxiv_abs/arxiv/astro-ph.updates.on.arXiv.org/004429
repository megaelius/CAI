One of the most important features in the solar atmosphere is magnetic network and its rela- tionship
with the transition region (TR), and coronal brightness. It is important to understand how energy
is transported into the corona and how it travels along the magnetic-field lines be- tween deep photosphere
and chromosphere through the TR and corona. An excellent proxy for transportation is the Interface
Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) raster scans and imaging observations in near-ultraviolet
(NUV) and far-ultraviolet (FUV) emission channels with high time-spatial resolutions. In this
study, we focus on the quiet Sun as observed with IRIS. The data with high signal to noise ratio in Si
IV, C II and Mg II k lines and with strong emission intensities show a high correlation in TR bright
network points. The results of the IRIS intensity maps and dopplergrams are compared with those
of Atmo- spheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instruments
onboard the Solar Dynamical Observatory (SDO). The average network intensity profiles show a strong
correlation with AIA coronal channels. Furthermore, we applied simultaneous observations of
magnetic network from HMI and found a strong relationship between the network bright points in all
levels of the solar atmosphere. These features in network elements exhibited high doppler velocity
regions and large mag- netic signatures. A dominative fraction of corona bright points emission,
accompanied by the magnetic origins in photosphere, suggest that magnetic-field concentrations
in the network rosettes could help couple between inner and outer solar atmosphere.
