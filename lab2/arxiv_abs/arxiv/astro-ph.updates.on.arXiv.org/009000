We examine simulated AGN systems (with luminosity $L_{\mathrm{bol}}>10^{42}~\mathrm{ergs/sec}$)
in the \texttt{MassiveBlackII} simulation by identifying them at different scales~(defined
by the maximum distance between member AGNs) to determine the AGN multiplicity functions. This
is defined as the volume/ surface density of AGN systems per unit \textit{richness} $R$, the number
of AGNs in a system. We find that gravitationally bound multiple AGN systems tend to populate scales
of $\lesssim0.7~\mathrm{cMpc}/h$; this corresponds to angular separations of $\lesssim100~\mathrm{arcsec}$
and a line of sight velocity difference $\lesssim200~\mathrm{km/sec}$. We predict that upcoming
surveys should find many such systems. In particular, eBOSS and DESI imaging areas should contain
$\sim100$ and $10^5$ triples/quadruples respectively at $0.06\lesssim z \lesssim 4$; at least
$20\%$ of these should be detectable in spectroscopic surveys. We expect LSST imaging area to contain
$\sim100$ triples/quadruples per $\mathrm{deg}^2$. Additionally, the simulation predictions
are consistent with current constraints on abundances of AGN pairs detected in SDSS for $0.02\lesssim
z \lesssim 0.15$, with $\gtrsim~85\%$ of them being gravitationally bound. The simulations predict
that quasar triples and quadruples predominantly exist at $1.5\lesssim z \lesssim 3$. Their members
have black hole masses $10^{6.5}\lesssim M_{bh}\lesssim 10^{9}~M_{\odot}/h$ and live in separate
(one central and multiple satellite) galaxies with stellar masses $10^{10}\lesssim M_{*}\lesssim
10^{12}~M_{\odot}/h$. They live in the most massive haloes (for e.g. $\sim 10^{13}~M_{\odot}/h$
at $z=2.5$; $\sim 10^{14}~M_{\odot}/h$ at $z=1$) in the simulation. Their detections provide
an exciting prospect for understanding massive black hole growth and their merger rates in galaxies
in the era of multimessenger astronomy.
