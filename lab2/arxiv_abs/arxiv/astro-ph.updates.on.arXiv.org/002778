We present results of cosmological simulations of disk galaxies carried out with the GADGET-3 TreePM+SPH
code, where star formation and stellar feedback are described using our MUlti Phase Particle Integrator
(MUPPI) model. This description is based on simple multi-phase model of the interstellar medium
at unresolved scales, where mass and energy flows among the components are explicitly followed
by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. Thermal energy from SNe is injected into
the local hot phase, so as to avoid that it is promptly radiated away. A kinetic feedback prescription
generates the massive outflows needed to avoid the over-production of stars. We use two sets of zoomed-in
initial conditions of isolated cosmological halos with masses (2-3) * 10^{12} Msun, both available
at several resolution levels. In all cases we obtain spiral galaxies with small bulge-over-total
stellar mass ratios (B/T \approx 0.2), extended stellar and gas disks, flat rotation curves and
realistic values of stellar masses. Gas profiles are relatively flat, molecular gas is found to
dominate at the centre of galaxies, with star formation rates following the observed Schmidt-Kennicutt
relation. Stars kinematically belonging to the bulge form early, while disk stars show a clear inside-out
formation pattern and mostly form after redshift z=2. However, the baryon conversion efficiencies
in our simulations differ from the relation given by Moster et al. (2010) at a 3 sigma level, thus indicating
that our stellar disks are still too massive for the Dark Matter halo in which they reside. Results
are found to be remarkably stable against resolution. This further demonstrates the feasibility
of carrying out simulations producing a realistic population of galaxies within representative
cosmological volumes, at a relatively modest resolution.
