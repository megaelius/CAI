The physical origin of diffuse Ly$\alpha$ halos (LAHs) around star-forming galaxies is still a
matter of debate. We present the dependence of LAH luminosity ($L({\rm Ly}\alpha)_H$) on the stellar
mass ($M_\star$), $SFR$, color excess ($E(B-V)_\star$), and dark matter halo mass ($M_{\rm h}$)
of the parent galaxy for $\sim 900$ Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z\sim2$ divided into ten subsamples.
We calculate $L({\rm Ly}\alpha)_H$ using the stacked observational relation between $L({\rm
Ly}\alpha)_H$ and central Ly$\alpha$ luminosity by Momose et al. (2016), which we find agrees with
the average trend of VLT/MUSE-detected individual LAEs. We find that our LAEs have relatively high
$L({\rm Ly}\alpha)_H$ despite low $M_\star$ and $M_{\rm h}$, and that $L({\rm Ly}\alpha)_H$ remains
almost unchanged with $M_\star$ and perhaps with $M_{\rm h}$. These results are incompatible with
the cold stream (cooling radiation) scenario and the satellite-galaxy star-formation scenario,
because the former predicts fainter $L({\rm Ly}\alpha)_H$ and both predict steeper $L({\rm Ly}\alpha)_H$
vs. $M_\star$ slopes. We argue that LAHs are mainly caused by Ly$\alpha$ photons escaping from the
main body and then scattered in the circum-galactic medium. This argument is supported by LAH observations
of H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs). When LAHs are taken into account, the Ly$\alpha$ escape fractions
of our LAEs are about ten times higher than those of HAEs with similar $M_\star$ or $E(B-V)_\star$,
which may partly arise from lower HI gas masses implied from lower $M_{\rm h}$ at fixed $M_\star$,
or from another Ly$\alpha$ source in the central part.
