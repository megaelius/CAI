We study a sample of 148 early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster using SDSS photometry and spectra,
and calibrate our results using detailed dynamical models for a subset of these galaxies, to create
a precise benchmark for dynamical scaling relations in high-density environments. For these galaxies,
we successfully measured global galaxy properties, modeled stellar populations, and created
dynamical models, and support the results using detailed dynamical models of 16 galaxies, including
the two most massive cluster galaxies, using data taken with the SAURON IFU. By design, the study
provides minimal scatter in derived scaling relations due to the small uncertainty in the relative
distances of galaxies compared to the cluster distance. Our results demonstrate low ($\leq$55%
for 90$^{th}$ percentile) dark matter fractions in the inner 1$R_{\rm e}$ ~of galaxies. Owing to
the study design, we produce the tightest, to our knowledge, IMF-$\sigma_e$ relation of galaxies,
with a slope consistent with that seen in local galaxies. Leveraging our dynamical models, we transform
the classical Fundamental Plane of the galaxies to the Mass Plane. We find that the coefficients
of the mass plane are close to predictions from the virial theorem, and have significantly lower
scatter compared to the Fundamental plane. We show that Coma galaxies occupy similar locations
in the (M$_*$ - $R_{\rm e}$) and (M$_*$ - $\sigma_e$) relations as local field galaxies but are older.
This, and the fact we find only three slow rotators in the cluster, is consistent with the scenario
of hierarchical galaxy formation and expectations of the kinematic morphology-density relation.
