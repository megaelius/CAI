The coupling between scalar and vector fields has a long and interesting history. Axions are one
key possibility to solve the strong CP problem and axion-like particles could be one solution to
the dark matter puzzle. Given the nature of the coupling, and the universality of free fall, nontrivial
important effects are expected in regions where gravity is strong. Here, we show that i. A background
EM field induces an axionic instability in flat space, for large enough electric fields. Conversely,
a homogeneous harmonic axion field induces an instability in the Maxwell sector. When carried over
to curved spacetime, this phenomena translates into generic instabilities of charged black holes
(BHs). ii. In the presence of charge, BH uniqueness results are lost. We find solutions which are
small deformations of the Kerr-Newman geometry and hairy stationary solutions without angular
momentum, which are `dragged' by the axion. Axion fields must exist around spinning BHs if these
are immersed in external magnetic fields. The axion profile can be obtained perturbatively from
the electro-vacuum solution derived by Wald. iii. Ultralight axions trigger superradiant instabilities
of spinning BHs and form an axionic cloud in the exterior geometry. The superradiant growth can be
interrupted or suppressed through axionic or scalar couplings to EM. These couplings lead to periodic
bursts of light, which occur throughout the history of energy extraction from the BH. We provide
numerical and simple analytical estimates for the rates of these processes. iv. Finally, we discuss
how plasma effects can affect the evolution of superradiant instabilities.
