GRB 130427A was extremely bright due to a combination of its low redshift and energetics typical
of high-redshift gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). As a result, we were able to obtain high-quality light
curves across the electromagnetic spectrum, providing an excellent opportunity for detailed
broadband modeling. We observed GRB 130427A with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and
collected well-sampled light curves at 1.4 and 4.8 GHz. Our observations with the European Very
Long Baseline Interferometry Network provide the best localization of this GRB, with a position
uncertainty of 0.6 milliarcseconds. Our flux density measurements are combined with all the data
available in the literature at radio, optical and X-ray frequencies to perform broadband modeling.
We show that the reverse-forward shock model that has been suggested to explain the GRB 130427A observations
does not give a good fit to all the light curve features once the entire broadband data set is modeled.
We suggest a two-component jet model as an alternative, providing a better description of the data,
and we discuss the implications and limitations of both models. The low density inferred from the
modeling implies that the GRB 130427A progenitor is either a very low-metallicity Wolf-Rayet star,
or a rapidly rotating, low-metallicity O star. In terms of the shock microphysics, we find that the
fraction of the energy in electrons is evolving in time, and that the fraction of electrons participating
in a relativistic power-law energy distribution is less than 15%. We observed intraday variability
during the earliest WSRT observations, and the source sizes inferred from our modeling are consistent
with this variability being due to interstellar scintillation effects. Finally, we present and
discuss our limits on the linear and circular polarization, which are among the deepest limits of
GRB radio polarization to date.
