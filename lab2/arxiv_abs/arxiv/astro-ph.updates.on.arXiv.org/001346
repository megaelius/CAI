Paper I presents the magnetic structure of a filament that developed in active region (AR) NOAA 10781.
In this paper we complement those results with the velocities retrieved from Doppler shifts measured
at the chromosphere and the photosphere in the AR filament area. Various inversion methods with
different numbers of atmospheric components and different weighting schemes of the Stokes profiles
were used. The velocities were calibrated on an absolute scale. A ubiquitous chromospheric downflow
is found in the faculae surrounding the filament, with an average velocity of 1.6 km/s. The filament
region, however, displays upflows in the photosphere on both days, when the linear polarization
(which samples the transverse component of the fields) is given more weight in the inversions. The
upflow speeds of the transverse fields in the filament region average -0.15 km/s. In the chromosphere,
the situation is different for the two days of observation. On July 3, the chromospheric portion
of the filament is moving upwards as a whole with a mean speed of -0.24 km/s. However, on July 5 only
the section above an orphan penumbra shows localized upflow patches, while the rest of the filament
is dominated by the same downflows observed elsewhere in the facular region. Photospheric supersonic
downflows that last for tens of minutes are detected below the filament, close to the PIL. The observed
velocity pattern in this AR filament strongly suggests a scenario where the transverse fields are
mostly dominated by upflows. The filament flux rope is seen to be emerging at all places and both heights,
with a few exceptions in the chromosphere. This happens within a surrounding facular region that
displays a generalized downflow in the chromosphere and localized downflows of supersonic character
at the photosphere. No large scale downflow of transverse field lines is observed at the photosphere.
