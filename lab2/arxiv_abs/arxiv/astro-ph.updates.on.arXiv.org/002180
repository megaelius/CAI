We perform a joint analysis of the abundance, the clustering and the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal
of galaxies from Data Release 11 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
Survey. We fit halo occupation parameters and cosmological parameters ($\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$)
to both of these observables simultaneously, and thus break the degeneracy between galaxy bias
and cosmology. The cosmological analysis is the first of its kind to be performed at a redshift as
high as 0.53. We present measurements of the clustering signal of galaxies by utilizing various
stellar mass threshold samples. The galaxy-galaxy weak lensing signal is obtained by using the
shape catalog of background galaxies from the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, which
was made publicly available by the CFHTLenS collaboration, with an area overlap of about 100 deg$^2$.
We analyze these measurements in the framework of the halo model. Adopting a flat {\Lambda}CDM cosmology
with priors on $\Omega_bh^2$, $n_s$ and $h$ from the analysis of WMAP 9-year data, we obtain $\Omega_m$
= $0.310^{+0.019}_{-0.020}$ and $\sigma_8$ = $0.785$^{+0.044}_{-0.044} (68% confidence) after
marginalizing over the halo occupation distribution parameters and a number of other nuisance
parameters in our model. We demonstrate the robustness of our results with respect to sample selection
and a variety of systematics such as the halo off-centering effect and possible incompleteness
in our sample. Our constraints are consistent, complementary and competitive with those obtained
using other independent probes of these cosmological parameters.
