Context. Solar outflows are a considerable source of free energy which accumulates in multiple
forms like beaming (or drifting) components and/or temperature anisotropies. However, kinetic
anisotropies of plasma particles do not grow indefinitely and particle-particle collisions are
not efficient enough to explain the observed limits of these anisotropies. Instead, the self-generated
wave instabilities can efficiently act to constrain kinetic anisotropies, but the existing approaches
are simplified and do not provide satisfactory explanations. Thus, small deviations from isotropy
shown by the electron temperature ($T$) in fast solar winds are not explained yet. Aims. This paper
provides an advanced quasilinear description of the whistler instability driven by the anisotropic
electrons in conditions typical for the fast solar winds. The enhanced whistler-like fluctuations
may constrain the upper limits of temperature anisotropy $A \equiv T_\perp /T_\parallel > 1$, where
$\perp, \parallel$ are defined with respect to the magnetic field direction. Methods. Studied
are the self-generated whistler instabilities, cumulatively driven by the temperature anisotropy
and the relative (counter)drift of the electron populations, e.g., core and halo electrons. Recent
studies have shown that quasi-stable states are not bounded by the linear instability thresholds
but an extended quasilinear approach is necessary to describe them in this case. Results. Marginal
conditions of stability are obtained from a quasilinear theory of the cumulative whistler instability,
and approach the quasi-stable states of electron populations reported by the observations.The
instability saturation is determined by the relaxation of both the temperature anisotropy and
the relative drift of electron populations.
