We present a new fast and efficient approach to model structure formation with Augmented Lagrangian
Perturbation Theory (ALPT). Our method is based on splitting the displacement field into a long
and a short-range component. The long-range component is computed by second order LPT (2LPT). This
approximation contains a tidal nonlocal and nonlinear term. Unfortunately, 2LPT fails on small
scales due to severe shell crossing and a crude quadratic behaviour in the low density regime. The
spherical collapse (SC) approximation has been recently reported to correct for both effects by
adding an ideal collapse truncation. However, this approach fails to reproduce the structures
on large scales where it is significantly less correlated with the N-body result than 2LPT or linear
LPT (the Zeldovich approximation). We propose to combine both approximations using for the short-range
displacement field the SC solution. A Gaussian filter with a smoothing radius r_S is used to separate
between both regimes. We use the result of 25 dark matter only N-body simulations to benchmark at
z=0 the different approximations: 1st, 2nd, 3rd order LPT, SC and our novel combined ALPT model.
This comparison demonstrates that our method improves previous approximations at all scales showing
~25% and ~75% higher correlation than 2LPT with the N-body solution at k = 1 and 2 h Mpc^-1, respectively.
We conduct a parameter study to determine the optimal range of smoothing radii and find that the maximum
correlation is achieved with r_S = 4 - 5 h^-1 Mpc. This structure formation approach could be used
for various purposes, such as setting-up initial conditions for N-body simulations, generating
mock galaxy catalogues, cosmic web analysis or for reconstructions of the primordial density fluctuations.
