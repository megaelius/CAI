We present a flux-resolved X-ray analysis of the dwarf Seyfert 1.8 galaxy NGC 4395, based on three
archival $XMM-Newton$ and one archival $NuSTAR$ observations. The source is known to harbor a low
mass black hole ($\sim 10^4- {\rm a~ few~}\times 10^{5}~\rm M_\odot$) and shows strong variability
in the full X-ray range during these observations. We model the flux-resolved spectra of the source
assuming three absorbing layers: neutral, mildly ionized, and highly ionized ($N_{\rm H} \sim
1.6\times 10^{22}-3.4 \times 10^{23}~\rm cm^{-2}$, $\sim 0.8-7.8 \times 10^{22}~\rm cm^{-2}$,
and $ 3.8 \times 10^{22}~\rm cm^{-2}$, respectively. The source also shows intrinsic variability
by a factor of $\sim 3$, on short timescales, due to changes in the nuclear flux, assumed to be a power
law ($\Gamma = 1.6-1.67$). Our results show a positive correlation between the intrinsic flux and
the absorbers' ionization parameter. The covering fraction of the neutral absorber varies during
the first $XMM-Newton$ observation, which could explain the pronounced soft X-ray variability.
However, the source remains fully covered by this layer during the other two observations, largely
suppressing the soft X-ray variability. This suggests an inhomogeneous and layered structure
in the broad line region. We also find a difference in the characteristic timescale of the power spectra
between different energy ranges and observations. We finally show simulated spectra with $XRISM$,
$Athena$, and $eXTP$, which will allow us to characterize the different absorbers, study their
dynamics, and will help us identify their locations and sizes.
