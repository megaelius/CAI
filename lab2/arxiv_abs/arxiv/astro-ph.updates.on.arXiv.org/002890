Short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) are among the most luminous explosions in the Universe and their
origin still remains uncertain. Observational evidence favors the association with binary neutron
star or neutron star-black hole (NS-BH) binary mergers. Leading models relate SGRBs to a relativistic
jet launched by the BH-torus system resulting from the merger. However, recent observations have
revealed a large fraction of SGRB events accompanied by X-ray afterglows with durations $\sim10^2-10^5
\mathrm{s}$, suggesting continuous energy injection from a long-lived central engine, which
is incompatible with the short ($\lesssim1 \mathrm{s}$) accretion timescale of a BH-torus system.
The formation of a supramassive NS, resisting the collapse on much longer spin-down timescales,
can explain these afterglow durations, but leaves serious doubts on whether a relativistic jet
can be launched at merger. Here we present a novel scenario accommodating both aspects, where the
SGRB is produced after the collapse of a supramassive NS. Early differential rotation and subsequent
spin-down emission generate an optically thick environment around the NS consisting of a photon-pair
nebula and an outer shell of baryon-loaded ejecta. While the jet easily drills through this environment,
spin-down radiation diffuses outwards on much longer timescales and accumulates a delay that allows
the SGRB to be observed before (part of) the long-lasting X-ray signal. By analyzing diffusion timescales
for a wide range of physical parameters, we find delays that can generally reach $\sim10^5 \mathrm{s}$,
compatible with observations. The success of this fundamental test makes this "time-reversal"
scenario an attractive alternative to current SGRB models.
