We used the ugr magnitudes of 1,437,467 F-G type main-sequence stars with metal abundance -2<[Fe/H]<+0.2
dex and estimated radial and vertical metallicity gradients for high Galactic-latitude fields
(b>50) of the Milky Way Galaxy. The radial metallicity gradient d[Fe/H]/dR=-0.042(0.011) dex/kpc
estimated for the stars with 1.31<z<=1.74 kpc is attributed to the thin-disc population. While,
the radial gradients evaluated for stars at higher vertical distances are close to zero indicating
that the thick disc and halo have not undergone a radial collapse phase at least at high Galactic latitudes.
The vertical metallicity gradients estimated for stars with three different Galactic latitudes,
50<b <=65, 65<b<=80 and 80<b<=90 do not show a strong indication for Galactic latitude dependence
of our gradients. The thin disc, 0.5<z<=2 kpc, with a vertical metallicity gradient d[Fe/H]/dz=
-0.308(0.018) dex/kpc, is dominant only in galactocentric distance (R) interval 6<R<=10 kpc,
while the thick disc (2<z<=5 kpc) could be observed in the intervals 6<R<=10 and 10<R<=15 kpc with
compatible vertical metallicity gradients, i.e. d[Fe/H]/dz= -0.164(0.014) dex/kpc and d[Fe/H]/dz=
-0.172(0.016) dex/kpc. Five vertical metallicity gradients are estimated for the halo (z>5 kpc)
in three R distance intervals, 6<R<=10, 10<R<=15 and 15<R<=20 kpc. The first one corresponding
to the interval 6<R<=10 kpc is equal to d[Fe/H]/dz= -0.023(0.006) dex/kpc, while the others at larger
R distances are close to zero. We derived synthetic vertical metallicity gradients for 2,230,167
stars and compared them with the observed ones. There is a good agreement between the two sets of vertical
metallicity gradients for the thin disc, while they are different for the thick disc. For the halo,
the conspicuous difference corresponds to the R distance interval 6<R<=10 kpc, while they are compatible
at higher R distance intervals.
