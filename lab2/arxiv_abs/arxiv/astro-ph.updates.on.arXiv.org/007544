Unipolar magnetic regions are often associated with supergranular cells. The chromosphere above
these regions is regulated by the magnetic field, but the field structure is poorly known. In unipolar
regions, the fibrillar arrangement does not always coincide with magnetic field lines, and polarimetric
observations are needed to establish the chromospheric magnetic topology. In an active region
close to the limb, we observed a unipolar annular network of supergranular size. This supergranular
structure harbours a radial distribution of the fibrils converging towards its centre. We observed
this structure at different heights by taking data in the FeI 6301-6302 {\AA}, H-\alpha, CaII 8542
\AA\ and the CaII H&K spectral lines with the CRISP and CHROMIS instruments at the Swedish 1-m Solar
Telescope. We performed Milne-Eddington inversions of the spectropolarimetric data of FeI and
applied the weak field approximation to CaII 8542 \AA\ data to retrieve the magnetic field in the
photosphere and chromosphere. We used magnetograms of CRISP, HINODE/SP and HMI to calculate the
magnetic flux. We investigated the velocity using the line-of-sight velocities computed from
the Milne-Eddington inversion and from Doppler shift of the K$_3$ feature in the CaII K spectral
line. To describe the typical spectral profiles characterising the chromosphere above the supergranular
structure, we performed a K-mean clustering of the spectra in CaIIK. The photospheric magnetic
flux is not balanced. The magnetic field vector at chromospheric heights, retrieved by the weak
field approximation, indicates that the field lines within the supegranular cell tend to point
inwards, and might form a canopy above the unipolar region. In the centre of the supergranular cell
hosting the unipolar region, we observe a persistent chromospheric brightening coinciding with
a strong gradient in the line-of-sight velocity.
