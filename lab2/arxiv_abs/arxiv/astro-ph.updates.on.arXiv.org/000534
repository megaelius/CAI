We present a detailed diagnostic study of the observed temperatures of the hot X-ray coronae of early-type
galaxies. By extending the investigation carried out in Pellegrini (2011) with spherical models,
we focus on the dependence of the energy budget and temperature of the hot gas on the galaxy structure
and internal stellar kinematics. By solving the Jeans equations we construct realistic axisymmetric
three-component galaxy models (stars, dark matter halo, central black hole) with different degrees
of flattening and rotational support. The kinematical fields are projected along different lines
of sight, and the aperture velocity dispersion is computed within a fraction of the circularized
effective radius. The model parameters are chosen so that the models resemble real ETGs and lie on
the Faber-Jackson and Size-Luminosity relations. For these models we compute T_* (the stellar
heating contribution to the gas injection temperature) and T_gm (the temperature equivalent of
the energy required for the gas escape). In particular, different degrees of thermalisation of
the ordered rotational field of the galaxy are considered. We find that T_* and T_gm can vary only
mildly due to a pure change of shape. Galaxy rotation instead, when not thermalised, can lead to a
large decrease of T_*; this effect can be larger in flatter galaxies that can be more rotationally
supported. Recent temperature measurements T_x, obtained with Chandra, are larger than, but close
to, the T_* values of the models, and show a possible trend for a lower T_x in flatter and more rotationally
supported galaxies; this trend can be explained by the lack of thermalisation of the whole stellar
kinetic energy. Flat and rotating galaxies also show lower L_x values, and then a lower gas content,
but this is unlikely to be due to the small variation of T_gm found here for them.
