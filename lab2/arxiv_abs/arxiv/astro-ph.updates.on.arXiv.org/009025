We develop a semi-analytic model to explore the physical properties of cool pressure-confined
circumgalactic clouds with mass ranging from $10$ to $10^{8} \, \rm M_{\odot}$ in a hot diffuse halo.
We consider physical effects that control the motion and mass loss of the clouds, and estimate the
lifetime and the observed properties of individual cool gas clouds inferred from the CLOUDY simulation.
Our results show that the cool pressure-confined gas clouds have physical properties consistent
with absorption line systems with neutral hydrogen column densities $N_{\rm HI}\geq10^{18.5}
\rm cm^{-2}$ such as strong metal absorbers, sub-DLAs, and DLAs. The cool circumgalactic clouds
are transient due to evaporation and recycling and therefore a constant replenishment is needed
to maintain the cool CGM. We further model the ensemble properties of the cool CGM with clouds originated
from outflows, inflows, or/and in-situ formation with a range of initial cloud mass function and
velocity distribution. We find that only with a certain combination of parameters, an outflow model
can broadly reproduce three cool gas properties around star-forming galaxies simultaneously:
the spatial distribution, down-the-barrel outflow absorption, and gas velocity dispersion.
Both a constant insitu model and gas inflow model can reproduce the observed covering fractions
of high $\rm N_{HI}$ gas around passive galaxies but they fail to reproduce sufficient number of
low $\rm N_{HI}$ systems. The limitations and the failures of the current models are discussed.
Our results illustrate that semi-analytic modeling is a promising tool to understand the physics
of the cool CGM which is usually unresolved by state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamic simulations.
