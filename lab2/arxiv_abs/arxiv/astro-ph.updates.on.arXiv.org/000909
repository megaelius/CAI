Our general understanding of multiple star and planet formation is primarily based on observations
of young multiple systems in low density regions like Tau-Aur and Oph. Since many, if not most, of
the stars are born in clusters, observational constraints from young binaries in those environments
are fundamental for understanding both the formation of multiple systems and planets in multiple
systems throughout the Galaxy. We build upon the largest survey for young binaries in the Orion Nebula
Cluster (ONC) which is based on Hubble Space Telescope observations to derive both stellar and circumstellar
properties of newborn binary systems in this cluster environment. We present Adaptive Optics spatially-resolved
JHKL'-band photometry and K-band R$\sim$\,5000 spectra for a sample of 8 ONC binary systems from
this database. We characterize the stellar properties of binary components and obtain a census
of protoplanetary disks through K-L' color excess. For a combined sample of ONC binaries including
7 additional systems with NIR spectroscopy from the literature, we derive mass ratio and relative
age distributions. We compare the stellar and circumstellar properties of binaries in ONC with
those in Tau-Aur and Oph from samples of binaries with stellar properties derived for each component
from spectra and/or visual photometry and with a disk census obtained through K-L color excess.
The mass ratio distribution of ONC binaries is found to be indistinguishable from that of Tau-Aur
and, to some extent, to that of Oph in the separation range 85-560\,AU and for primary mass in the range
0.15 to 0.8\,M$_{\sun}$.A trend toward a lower mass ratio with larger separation is suggested in
ONC binaries which is not seen in Tau-Aur binaries.The components of ONC binaries are found to be
significantly more coeval than the overall ONC population and as coeval as components of binaries
in Tau-Aur and Oph[...]
