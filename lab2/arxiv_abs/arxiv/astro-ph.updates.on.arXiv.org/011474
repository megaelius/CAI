Alpha Centauri A is the closest solar-type star to the Sun and offers an excellent opportunity to
detect the thermal emission of a mature planet heated by its host star. The MIRI coronagraph on JWST
can search the 1-3 AU (1"-2") region around alpha Cen A which is predicted to be stable within the alpha
Cen AB system. We demonstrate that with reasonable performance of the telescope and instrument,
a 20 hr program combining on-target and reference star observations at 15.5 um could detect thermal
emission from planets as small as ~5 RE. Multiple visits every 3-6 months would increase the geometrical
completeness, provide astrometric confirmation of detected sources, and push the radius limit
down to ~3 RE. An exozodiacal cloud only a few times brighter than our own should also be detectable,
although a sufficiently bright cloud might obscure any planet present in the system. While current
precision radial velocity (PRV) observations set a limit of 50-100 ME at 1-3 AU for planets orbiting
alpha Cen A, there is a broad range of exoplanet radii up to 10 RE consistent with these mass limits.
A carefully planned observing sequence along with state-of-the-art post-processing analysis
could reject the light from alpha Cen A at the level of ~10^-5 at 1"-2" and minimize the influence of
alpha Cen B located 7-8" away in the 2022-2023 timeframe. These space-based observations would
complement on-going imaging experiments at shorter wavelengths as well as PRV and astrometric
experiments to detect planets dynamically. Planetary demographics suggest that the likelihood
of directly imaging a planet whose mass and orbit are consistent with present PRV limits is small,
~5%, and possibly lower if the presence of a binary companion further reduces occurrence rates.
However, at a distance of just 1.34 pc, alpha Cen A is our closest sibling star and certainly merits
close scrutiny.
