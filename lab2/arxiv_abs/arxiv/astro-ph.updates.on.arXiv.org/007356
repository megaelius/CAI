We carry out 2D viscous hydrodynamical simulations of circumbinary accretion using the AREPO code.
We self-consistently compute the accretion flow over a wide range of spatial scales, from the circumbinary
disk far from the central binary, through accretion streamers, to the disks around individual binary
components, resolving the flow down to 2% of the binary separation. We focus on equal mass binaries
with arbitrary eccentricities. We evolve the flow over long (viscous) timescales until a quasi-steady
is reached, in which the mass supply rate at large distances $\dot M_0$ (assumed constant) equals
the time averaged mass transfer rate across the disk and the total mass accretion rate onto the binary
components. This quasi-steady state allows us to compute the secular angular momentum transfer
rate onto the binary, $\langle \dot J_b\rangle$, and the resulting orbital evolution. Through
direct computation of the gravitational and accretion torques on the binary, we find that $\langle
\dot J_b\rangle$ is consistently positive (i.e., the binary gains angular momentum), with $l_0\equiv
\langle \dot J_b\rangle/\dot M_0$ in range of $(0.4-0.8)a_b^2\Omega_b$, depending on the binary
eccentricity (where $a_b,~\Omega_b$ are the binary semi-major axis and angular frequency); we
also find that this $\langle \dot J_b\rangle$ is equal to the net angular momentum current across
the circumbinary disk, indicating that global angular momentum balance is achieved in our simulations.
We compute the time-averaged rate of change of the binary orbital energy for eccentric binaries,
and thus obtain the secular rates $\langle \dot a_b\rangle$ and $\langle \dot e_b\rangle$. In all
cases, $\langle \dot a_b\rangle$ is positive, i.e., the binary expands while accreting. We discuss
the implications of our results for the merger of supermassive binary black holes and for the formation
of close stellar binaries.
