The origin of GeV emission from the early epoch of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is a widely discussed issue.
The long gamma-ray burst GRB 170405A, observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope showed high-energy
emission delayed by $\sim$20 s with respect to the X-ray emission, followed by temporally fading
gamma-ray emission lasting for $\sim$1,000 s, as commonly observed in high-energy GRBs. In addition,
a high-energy spectral cutoff at $\sim$50 MeV was detected in the prompt emission phase. If this
feature is caused by pair-production opacity, the bulk Lorentz factor of the GRB ejecta can be estimated
to be $\Gamma_{\rm bulk}$ = 170-420. Simultaneously with Fermi, GRB 170405A was observed by Swift/Burst
Alert Telescope (BAT) and X-ray telescope (XRT), and a clear optical onset was detected $\sim$200
s after the burst by Swift/UltraViolet Optical Telescope (UVOT). By coupling the deceleration
time to the derived bulk Lorentz factor, the deceleration time was found to correspond to the delayed
onset in the optical band. While the delayed onset in the optical band is evidence that this emission
had an external shock origin, the temporally extended emission in the GeV band before the optical
onset is hard to reconcile with the standard synchrotron emission from the same external shock.
This may imply that the common feature of GeV emission with a power-law decay does not necessarily
have the same origin of the optical afterglow in all Fermi/LAT GRBs, particularly in their early
epoch. Another emission mechanism to explain the GeV emission in GRB 170405A can be required such
as an internal-shock or inverse Compton emission.
