This is the second paper of our series of works of studying the effects of active galactic nuclei (AGN)
feedback on the cosmological evolution of an isolated elliptical galaxy by performing two-dimensional
high-resolution hydrodynamical numerical simulations. In these simulations, the inner boundary
is chosen so that the Bondi radius is resolved. Physical processes like star formation, SNe Ia and
II are taken into account. Compared to previous works, the main improvements is that we adopt the
most updated AGN physics, which is described in detail in the first paper of this series (Yuan et al.
2018, Paper I). These improvements include the discrimination of the two accretion modes of the
central AGN and the most updated descriptions of the wind and radiation in the two modes. In Paper
I, we consider the case that the specific angular momentum of the gas in the galaxy is very low. In this
paper, we consider the case that the specific angular momentum of the gas is high. In the galactic
scale, we adopt the gravitational torques raised due to non-axisymmetric structure in the galaxy
as the mechanism of the transfer of angular momentum of gas, as proposed in some recent works. Since
our simulations are axisymmetric, we make use of a parameterized prescription to mimic this mechanism.
Same as Paper I, we investigate the AGN light curve, typical AGN lifetime, growth of the black hole
mass, AGN duty-cycle, star formation, and the X-ray surface brightness of the galaxy. Special attention
is paid to the effects of specific angular momentum of the galaxy on these properties. We find that
some results are qualitatively similar to those shown in Paper I, while some results such as star
formation and black hole growth do show a significant difference due to the mass concentration in
the galactic disk as a consequence of galactic rotation.
