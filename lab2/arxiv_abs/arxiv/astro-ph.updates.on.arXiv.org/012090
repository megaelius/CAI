With the wealth of information from large surveys and observational campaigns in the contemporary
era, it is critical to properly exploit the data to constrain the parameters of Galactic chemical
evolution models and quantify the associated uncertainties. We aim at constraining the two-infall
chemical evolution models for the solar annulus using the measured chemical abundance ratios and
seismically inferred age of stars in the APOKASC sample. In the revised two-infall chemical evolution
models by Spitoni et al. (2019), a significant delay of $\sim 4.3$ Gyr has been invoked between the
two episodes of gas accretion. In this work, we wish to test its robustness and statistically confirm/quantify
the delay. For the first time, a Bayesian framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods has
been used for fitting the two-infall chemical evolution models to the data. In addition to fitting
the data for stars in the APOKASC sample, our best fit models also reproduce other important observational
constraints of the chemical evolution of the disk: i) present day stellar surface density; ii) present
day supernova and star formation rates; iii) the metallicity distribution function; and iv) solar
abundance values. We found a significant delay between the two gas accretion episodes for various
models explored with different values for the star formation efficiencies. The values for the delay
lie in the range $4.5-5.5$ Gyr. The results suggest that the APOKASC sample carries the signature
of delayed gas-rich merger, with the dilution as main process determining the shape of low-$\alpha$
stars in the abundance ratios space.
