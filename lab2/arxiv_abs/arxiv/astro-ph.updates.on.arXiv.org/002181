We combine multiwavelength data in the AEGIS-XD and C-COSMOS surveys to measure the typical dark
matter halo mass of X-ray selected AGN [Lx(2-10keV)>1e42 erg/s] in comparison with far-infrared
selected star-forming galaxies detected in the Herschel/PEP survey (PACS Evolutionary Probe;
Lir>1e11 solar) and quiescent systems at z~1. We develop a novel method to measure the clustering
of extragalactic populations that uses photometric redshift Probability Distribution Functions
in addition to any spectroscopy. This is advantageous in that all sources in the sample are used in
the clustering analysis, not just the subset with secure spectroscopy. The method works best for
large samples. The loss of accuracy because of the lack of spectroscopy is balanced by increasing
the number of sources used to measure the clustering. We find that X-ray AGN, far-infrared selected
star-forming galaxies and passive systems in the redshift interval 0.6<z<1.4 are found
in halos of similar mass, $\log M_{DMH}/(M_{\odot}\,h^{-1})\approx13.0$. We argue that this
is because the galaxies in all three samples (AGN, star-forming, passive) have similar stellar
mass distributions, approximated by the J-band luminosity. Therefore all galaxies that can potentially
host X-ray AGN, because they have stellar masses in the appropriate range, live in dark matter haloes
of $\log M_{DMH}/(M_{\odot}\,h^{-1})\approx13.0$ independent of their star-formation rates.
This suggests that the stellar mass of X-ray AGN hosts is driving the observed clustering properties
of this population. We also speculate that trends between AGN properties (e.g. luminosity, level
of obscuration) and large scale environment may be related to differences in the stellar mass of
the host galaxies.
