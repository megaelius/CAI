Upcoming wide-field surveys are well-suited to studying the growth of galaxy clusters by tracing
galaxy and gas accretion along cosmic filaments. We use hydrodynamic simulations of volumes surrounding
324 clusters from \textsc{The ThreeHundred} project to develop a framework for identifying and
characterising these filamentary structures, and associating galaxies with them. We define 3-dimensional
reference filament networks reaching $5R_{200}$ based on the underlying gas distribution and
quantify their recovery using mock galaxy samples mimicking observations such as those of the WEAVE
Wide-Field Cluster Survey. Since massive galaxies trace filaments, they are best recovered by
mass-weighting galaxies or imposing a bright limit (e.g. $>L^*$) on their selection. We measure
the transverse gas density profile of filaments, derive a characteristic filament radius of $\simeq0.7$--$1~h^{-1}\rm{Mpc}$,
and use this to assign galaxies to filaments. For different filament extraction methods we find
that at $R>R_{200}$, $\sim15$--$20%$ of galaxies with $M_*>3 \times 10^9 M_{\odot}$ are in filaments,
increasing to $\sim60%$ for galaxies more massive than the Milky-Way. The fraction of galaxies
in filaments is independent of cluster mass and dynamical state, and is a function of cluster-centric
distance, increasing from $\sim13$% at $5R_{200}$ to $\sim21$% at $1.5R_{200}$. As a bridge to
the design of observational studies, we measure the purity and completeness of different filament
galaxy selection strategies. Encouragingly, the overall 3-dimensional filament networks and
$\sim67$% of the galaxies associated with them are recovered from 2-dimensional galaxy positions.
