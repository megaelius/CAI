Recent numerical simulations of globular clusters (GCs) have shown that stellar-mass black holes
(BHs) play a fundamental role in driving cluster evolution and shaping their present-day structure.
Rapidly mass-segregating to the center of GCs, BHs act as a dynamical energy source via repeated
super-elastic scattering, delaying onset of core collapse and limiting mass segregation for visible
stars. While recent discoveries of BH candidates in Galactic and extragalactic GCs have further
piqued interest in BH-mediated cluster dynamics, numerical models show that even if significant
BH populations remain in today's GCs, they are typically in configurations that are not directly
detectable. We demonstrated in Weatherford et al. (2018) that an anti-correlation between a suitable
measure of mass segregation ($\Delta$) in observable stellar populations and the number of retained
BHs in GC models can be applied to indirectly probe BH populations in real GCs. Here, we estimate the
number and total mass of BHs presently retained in 50 Milky Way GCs from the ACS Globular Cluster Survey
by measuring $\Delta$ between populations of main sequence stars, using correlations found between
$\Delta$ and BH retention in the CMC Cluster Catalog models. We demonstrate that the range in $\Delta$'s
distribution from our models matches that for observed GCs to a remarkable degree. Our results further
provide the narrowest constraints to-date on the retained BH populations in the GCs analyzed. Of
these 50 GCs, we identify NGCs 2808, 5927, 5986, 6101, and 6205 to presently contain especially large
BH populations, each with total BH mass exceeding $10^3\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$.
