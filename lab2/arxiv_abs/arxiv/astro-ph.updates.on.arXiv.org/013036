Context. The [CII] 158 {\mu}m far-infrared (FIR) fine-structure line is one of the most important
cooling lines of the star-forming interstellar medium (ISM). High spectral resolution observations
have shown complex structures in the line profiles of the [CII] emission. Aims. Our aim is to determine
whether the complex profiles observed in [^{12}CII] are due to individual velocity components
along the line-of-sight or to self-absorption based on a comparison of the [^{12}CII] and isotopic
[^{13}CII] line profiles. Methods. Deep integrations with the SOFIA/upGREAT 7-pixel array receiver
in M43, Horsehead~PDR, Monoceros~R2, and M17~SW allow for the detection of optically thin [^{13}CII]
emission lines, along with the [^{12}CII] emission lines, with a high signal-to-noise ratio. We
first derived the [^{12}CII] optical depth and the [CII] column density from a single component
model. However, the complex line profiles observed require a double layer model with an emitting
background and an absorbing foreground. A multi-component velocity fit allows us to derive the
physical conditions of the [CII] gas: column density and excitation temperature. Results. We find
moderate to high [^{12}CII] optical depths in all four sources and self-absorption of [^{12}CII]
in Mon R2 and M17 SW. The high column density of the warm background emission corresponds to an equivalent
Av of up to 41 mag. The foreground absorption requires substantial column densities of cold and dense
[CII] gas, with an equivalent Av ranging up to about 13 mag. Conclusions. The column density of the
warm background material requires multiple photon-dominated region (PDR) surfaces stacked along
the line of sight and in velocity. The substantial column density of dense and cold foreground [CII]
gas detected in absorption cannot be explained with any known scenario and we can only speculate
on its origins
