We report the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) discovery of three terrestrial-sized
planets transiting L 98-59 (TOI-175, TIC 307210830) -- a bright M dwarf at a distance of 10.6 pc. Using
the Gaia-measured distance and broad-band photometry we find that the host star is an M3 dwarf. Combined
with the TESS transits from one sector, the corresponding stellar parameters yield planet radii
ranging from 0.7 REarth to 1.3 REarth. All three planets have short orbital periods, ranging from
2.25 to 7.45 days with the outer pair just wide of a 2:1 period resonance. Diagnostic tests produced
by the TESS Data Validation and the vetting package DAVE rule out common false positive sources.
These analyses, along with dedicated follow-up and the multiplicity of the system, lend confidence
that the observed signals are caused by planets transiting L 98-59 and are not associated with other
sources in the field. The L 98-59 system is interesting for a number of reasons: the host star is bright
(V = 11.7 mag, K = 7.1 mag) and the planets are prime targets for further follow-up observations including
precision radial-velocity mass measurements and future transit spectroscopy with the James Webb
Space Telescope; the near resonant configuration makes the system a laboratory to study planetary
system dynamical evolution; and three planets of relatively similar size in the same system present
an opportunity to study terrestrial planets where other variables (age, metallicity, etc.) can
be held constant. L 98-59 will be observed in 6 more TESS sectors, which will provide a wealth of information
on the three currently known planets and have the potential to reveal additional planets in the system.
