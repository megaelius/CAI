We present a new method for probabilistically classifying supernovae (SNe) without using SN spectral
or photometric data. Unlike all previous studies to classify SNe without spectra, this technique
does not use any SN photometry. Instead, the method relies on host-galaxy data. We build upon the
well-known correlations between SN classes and host-galaxy properties, specifically that core-collapse
SNe rarely occur in red, luminous, or early-type galaxies. Using the nearly spectroscopically
complete Lick Observatory Supernova Search sample of SNe, we determine SN fractions as a function
of host-galaxy properties. Using these data as inputs, we construct a Bayesian method for determining
the probability that a SN is of a particular class. This method improves a common classification
figure of merit by a factor of >2, comparable to the best light-curve classification techniques.
Of the galaxy properties examined, morphology provides the most discriminating information.
We further validate this method using SN samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Palomar
Transient Factory. We demonstrate that this method has wide-ranging applications, including
separating different subclasses of SNe and determining the probability that a SN is of a particular
class before photometry or even spectra can. Since this method uses completely independent data
from light-curve techniques, there is potential to further improve the overall purity and completeness
of SN samples and to test systematic biases of the light-curve techniques. Further enhancements
to the host-galaxy method, including additional host-galaxy properties, combination with light-curve
methods, and hybrid methods should further improve the quality of SN samples from past, current,
and future transient surveys.
