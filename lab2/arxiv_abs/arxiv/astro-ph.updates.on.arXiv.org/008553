The core-collapse supernova (CCSN) mechanism is fundamentally three-dimensional with instabilities,
convection, and turbulence playing crucial roles in aiding neutrino-driven explosions. Simulations
of CCNSe including accurate treatments of neutrino transport and sufficient resolution to capture
key instabilities remain amongst the most expensive numerical simulations in astrophysics, prohibiting
large parameter studies in 2D and 3D. Studies spanning a large swath of the incredibly varied initial
conditions of CCSNe are possible in 1D, though such simulations must be artificially driven to explode.
We present a new method for including the most important effects of convection and turbulence in
1D simulations of neutrino-driven CCSNe, called Supernova Turbulence In Reduced-dimensionality,
or STIR. Our new approach includes crucial terms resulting from the turbulent and convective motions
of the flow. We estimate the strength of convection and turbulence using a modified mixing length
theory (MLT) approach introducing a few free parameters to the model which are fit to the results
of 3D simulations. For sufficiently large values of the mixing length parameter, turbulence-aided
neutrino-driven explosions are obtained. We compare the results of STIR to high-fidelity 3D simulations
and perform a parameter study of CCSN explosion using 138 solar-metallicity progenitor models
from 9 to 120 $M_\odot$. We find that STIR is a better predictor of which models will explode in multidimensional
simulations than other methods of driving explosions in 1D. We also present a preliminary investigation
of predicted observable characteristics of the CCSN population from STIR, such as the distributions
of explosion energies and remnant masses.
