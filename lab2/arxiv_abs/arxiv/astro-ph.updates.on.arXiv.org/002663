During galaxy mergers the gas falls to the center, triggers star formation, and feeds the rapid growth
of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). SMBHs respond to this fueling by supplying energy back to the
ambient gas. Numerical studies suggest that this feedback is necessary to explain why the properties
of SMBHs and the formation of bulges are closely related. This intimate link between the SMBH's mass
and the large scale dynamics and luminosity of the host has proven to be a difficult issue to tackle
with simulations due to the inability to resolve all the relevant length scales simultaneously.
In this paper we simulate SMBH growth at high-resolution with {\it FLASH}, accounting for the gravitational
focusing effects of nuclear star clusters (NSCs), which appear to be ubiquitous in galactic nuclei.
In the simulations, the NSC core is resolved by a minimum cell size of about 0.001 pc or approximately
$10^{-3}$ of the cluster's radius. We discuss the conditions required for effective gas funneling
to occur, which are mainly dominated by a relationship between NSC velocity dispersion and the local
sound speed, and provide a sub-grid prescription for the augmentation of central SMBH accretion
rates in the presence of NSCs. For the conditions expected to persist in the centers of merging galaxies,
the resultant large central gas densities in NSCs should produce drastically enhanced embedded
SMBH accretion rates - up to an order of magnitude increase can be achieved for gas properties resembling
those in large-scale galaxy merger simulations. This will naturally result in faster black hole
growth rates and higher luminosities than predicted by the commonly used Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton
accretion formalism.
