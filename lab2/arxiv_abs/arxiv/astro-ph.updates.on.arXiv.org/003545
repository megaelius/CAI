We report the discovery of a new star cluster, DES 3, in the constellation of Indus, and deeper observations
of the previously identified satellite DES J0222.7$-$5217 (Eridanus III). DES 3 was detected as
a stellar overdensity in first-year Dark Energy Survey data, and confirmed with deeper photometry
from the 4.1 metre Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) telescope. The new system was detected
with a relatively high significance and appears in the DES images as a compact concentration of faint
blue point sources. We determine that DES 3 is located at a heliocentric distance of $\sim 76\,\mathrm{kpc}$
and it is dominated by an old ($\simeq 9.8\,\mathrm{Gyr}$) and metal-poor ($\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\simeq
-1.88$) population. While the age and metallicity values of DES 3 are similar to globular clusters,
its half-light radius ($r_\mathrm{h}\sim 6.5\,\mathrm{pc}$) and luminosity ($M_V \sim -1.9$)
are more indicative of faint star clusters. Based on the apparent angular size, DES 3, with a value
of $r_\mathrm{h}\sim 0.\!^{\prime}3$, is among the smallest faint star clusters known to date.
Furthermore, using deeper imaging of DES J0222.7$-$5217 taken with the SOAR telescope, we update
structural parameters and perform the first isochrone modeling. Our analysis yields the first
age ($\simeq 12.6\,\mathrm{Gyr}$) and metallicity ($\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\simeq -2.01$) estimates
for this object. The half-light radius ($r_\mathrm{h}\sim 10.5\,\mathrm{pc}$) and luminosity
($M_V\sim -2.7$) of DES J0222.7$-$5217 suggest that it is likely a faint star cluster. The discovery
of DES 3 indicates that the census of stellar systems in the Milky Way is still far from complete, and
demonstrates the power of modern wide-field imaging surveys to improve our knowledge of the Galaxy's
satellite population.
