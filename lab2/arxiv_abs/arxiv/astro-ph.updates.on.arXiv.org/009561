Despite the tremendous success of general relativity so far, modified theories of gravity have
received increased attention lately, motivated from both theoretical and observational aspects.
Gravitational wave observations opened new possibilities for testing the viability of such theories
in the strong-field regime. One could test each theory against observed data one at a time, though
a more efficient approach would be to first probe gravity in a theory-agnostic way and map such information
to that on specific theories afterward. One example of such model-independent tests with gravitational
waves is the parameterized post-Einsteinian formalism, where one introduces generic parameters
in the amplitude and phase that capture non-Einsteinian effects. In this paper, we derive gravitational
waveforms from inspiraling compact binaries in various modified theories of gravity that violate
at least one fundamental pillar in general relativity. We achieve this by deriving relations between
corrections to the waveform amplitude/phase and those to the frequency evolution and Kepler's
third law, since the latter two have already been (or can easily be) derived in many theories. Such
an analysis allows us to derive corrections to the waveform amplitude, which extends many of previous
works that focused on phase corrections only. Moreover, we derive gravitational waveforms in theories
with varying gravitational constant. We extend the previous work by introducing two gravitational
constants (the conservative one entering in the binding energy and the dissipative one entering
in the gravitational wave luminosity) and allowing masses of binary constituents to vary with time.
We also correct some errors in previous literature. Our results can be used to improve current analyses
of testing general relativity as well as to achieve new projected constraints on many modified theories
of gravity.
