Ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are those X-ray sources located away from the centre of their
host galaxy with luminosities exceeding the Eddington limit of a stellar-mass black hole ($L_X>10^{39}\;{\rm
erg\,s}^{-1}$). The discovery of X-ray pulsations in some of these objects (e.g. M82~X-2) suggests
that a certain fraction of the ULX population may have a neutron star accretor. We present systematic
modelling of low- and intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs and IMXBs; donor-star mass range
$0.92$--$8.0$~M$_{\odot}$ and neutron-star accretors) to explain the formation of this sub-population
of ULXs. Using MESA, we explored the allowed initial parameter space of binary systems consisting
of a neutron star and a low- or intermediate-mass donor star that could explain the observed properties
of ULXs. Our simulations take into account beaming effects, stellar rotation, general angular
momentum losses, and a detailed and self-consistent calculation of the mass-transfer rate. We
study the conditions that lead to dynamical stability of these systems, which depends strongly
on the response of the donor star to mass loss. Using two values for the initial neutron star mass ($1.3$~M$_{\odot}$
and $2.0$~M$_{\odot}$), we present two sets of mass-transfer calculation grids. We find that LMXBs/IMXBs
can produce NS-ULXs with typical time-averaged isotropic-equivalent X-ray luminosities of $10^{39}$--$10^{41}\;{\rm
erg\,s}^{-1}$ on a timescale up to $\sim\!1.0\;{\rm Myr}$ for the lower luminosities. We also estimate
their likelihood of detection, the types of white-dwarf remnants left behind by the donors, and
the total amount of mass accreted by the neutron stars. We also compare our results to the observed
pulsating ULXs. Our results suggest that a large subset of the observed pulsating ULX population
can be explained by LMXBs/IMXBs undergoing a super-Eddington mass-transfer phase.
