Remote measurements and in-situ observations confirm the idea that asteroids up to few hundreds
of meters in size might be rubble piles. The dynamics of these objects can be studied using N-body
simulations of gravitational aggregation. We investigate the role of particle shape in N-body
simulations of gravitational aggregation. We study contact interaction mechanisms and the effects
of parameters such as surface friction, particle size distribution and number of particles in the
aggregate. We discuss the case of rubble pile reshaping under its own self-gravity, with no spin
and no external force imposed. We implement the N-body gravitational aggregation problem with
contact and collisions between particles of irregular, non-spherical shape. Contact interactions
are modeled using a soft-contact method, considering the visco-elastic behavior of particles'
surface. We perform numerical simulations to compare the behavior of spherical bodies with that
of irregular angular bodies. The simulations are performed starting from aggregates in non-equilibrium
state. We allow particles to settle through reshaping until they reach an equilibrium state. Preliminary
tests are studied to investigate the quantitative and qualitative behavior of the granular media.
The shape of particles plays a relevant role in the settling process of the rubble pile aggregate,
affecting both transient dynamics and global properties of the aggregate at equilibrium. In the
long term, particle shape dominates over simulation parameters such as surface friction, particle
size distribution and number of particles in the aggregate. Spherical particles are not suitable
to model accurately the physics of contact interactions between particles of N-body aggregation
simulations. Irregular particles are required for a more realistic and accurate representation
of the contact interaction mechanisms.
