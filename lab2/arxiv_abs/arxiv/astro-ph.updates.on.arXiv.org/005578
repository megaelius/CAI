A deep understanding of the Milky Way galaxy, its formation and evolution requires observations
of large numbers of stars. Stellar photometry provides an economical method to obtain intrinsic
stellar parameters. With the addition of distance information -- a prospect made real for more than
a billion stars with the second Gaia data release -- deriving reliable ages from photometry is a possibility.
We developed a Bayesian method to generate 2D probability maps of a star's age and metallicity from
photometry and parallax using isochrones. Our synthetic tests show that colours in the optical
or near-infrared cannot by themselves provide unique ages and metallicities due to strong degeneracy
between the two parameters. Including a near-UV passband enables us to break this degeneracy for
many types of stars. It is possible to find well-constrained ages and metallicities for turn-off
and sub-giant stars with colours including a U band and a parallax with an uncertainty less than approximately
20%. Metallicities alone are possible for the main sequence and giant branch. We attempted to recover
ages and metallicities from real data, using the Gaia benchmark stars and the old open cluster NGC
188. This revealed significant limitations in the stellar isochrones. The ages of the cluster stars
varied with evolutionary stage, such that turn-off ages were discrepant with those on the sub-giant
branch and metallicities varied significantly throughout the HR diagram. Most importantly, the
parameters varied appreciably depending on which colour combinations were used in the derivation.
We conclude that there exists a noticeable mismatch between the photometry from isochrones and
those from observations. Our results here are a warning to those applying isochrone ages indiscriminately.
Further efforts to improve the models will result in significant advances in our ability to study
the Galaxy.
