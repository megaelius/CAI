The chemical enrichment of the Universe at all scales is related to stellar winds and explosive supernovae
phenomena. Metals produced by stars and later spread at the mega-parsec scale through the intra-cluster
medium (ICM) become a fossil record of the chemical enrichment of the Universe and of the dynamical
and feedback mechanisms determining their circulation. As demonstrated by the results of the soft
X-ray spectrometer onboard Hitomi, high resolution X-ray spectroscopy is the path to to differentiate
among the models that consider different metal production mechanisms, predict the outcoming yields,
and are function of the nature, mass, and/or initial metallicity of their stellar progenitor. Transformational
results shall be achieved through improvements in the energy resolution and effective area of X-ray
observatories to detect rare metals (e.g. Na, Al) and constrain yet uncertain abundances (e.g.
C, Ne, Ca, Ni). The X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) instrument onboard the next-generation European
X-ray observatory Athena is expected to deliver such breakthroughs. Starting from 100 ks of synthetic
observations of 12 abundance ratios in the ICM of four simulated clusters, we demonstrate that the
X-IFU will be capable of recovering the input chemical enrichment models at both low ($z = 0.1$) and
high ($z = 1$) redshifts, while statistically excluding more than 99.5% of all the other tested combinations
of models. By fixing the enrichment models which provide the best fit to the simulated data, we also
show that the X-IFU will constrain the slope of the stellar initial mass function within $\sim$12%.
These constraints will be key ingredients in our understanding of the chemical enrichment of the
Universe and its evolution.
