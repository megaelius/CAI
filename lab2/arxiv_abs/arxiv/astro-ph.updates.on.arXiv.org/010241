Photometric and polarimetric observations toward type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) frequently report
an unusually low total-to-selective extinction ratio ($R_{\rm V} < 2$) and small peak wavelength
of polarization ($\lambda_{\rm max}< 0.4 \mu m$). Recently, Hoang et al. proposed that the increase
in the abundance of small grains relative to large grains near SNe Ia due to RAdiative Torque Disruption
(RATD) can explain this puzzle. To test this scenario, we will perform detailed modeling of dust
extinction and polarization of SNe Ia accounting for grain disruption by RATD and grain alignment
by RAdiative Torques (RATs). For dust clouds at distance $d< 4$ pc from the source, we find that $R_{\rm
V}$ decreases rapidly from the standard value of $3.1$ to $\sim 1.5$ after a disruption time $t_{\rm
disr}\le 40$ days. We then calculate the observed SNe Ia light curve and find that the colors of SNe
Ia would change with time due to time-varying extinction for dust clouds at distance of $d<4$ pc.
We also calculate the wavelength-dependence polarization produced by grains aligned with the
magnetic fields by RATs. We find that $ \lambda_{\rm max}$ decreases rapidly from $\sim 0.55 \mu$m
to $\sim 0.15 \mu$m over an alignment time of $t_{\rm align}< 10$ days due to the enhanced alignment
of small grains. By fitting the theoretical polarization curve with the Serkowski law, we find that
the parameter $K$ from the Serkowski law increases when large grains are disrupted by RATD which
can explain the $K$ vs. $\lambda_{\rm max}$ data observed for SNe Ia. Finally, we discover an anti-correlation
between $K$ and $R_{\rm V}$ which might already be supported by SNe Ia observational data. Our results
demonstrate the important effect of rotational disruption of dust grains by radiative torques
on the time-dependent extinction, polarization, and colors of SNe Ia.
