The atmospheric composition of transiting exoplanets can be characterized during transit by spectroscopy.
For the transit of an Earth twin, models predict that biogenic $O_2$ and $O_3$ should be detectable,
as well as water vapour, a molecule linked to habitability as we know it on Earth. The aim is to measure
the Earth radius versus wavelength $\lambda$ - or the atmosphere thickness $h(\lambda)$ - at the
highest spectral resolution available to fully characterize the signature of Earth seen as a transiting
exoplanet. We present observations of the Moon eclipse of 21-12-2010. Seen from the Moon, the Earth
eclipses the Sun and opens access to the Earth atmosphere transmission spectrum. We used HARPS and
UVES spectrographs to take penumbra and umbra high-resolution spectra from 3100 to 10400 Ang. A
change of the quantity of water vapour above the telescope compromised the quality of the UVES data.
We corrected for this effect in the data processing. We analyzed the data by 3 different methods.
The 1st method is based on the analysis of pairs of penumbra spectra. The 2nd makes use of a single penumbra
spectrum, and the 3rd of all penumbra and umbra spectra. Profiles $h(\lambda)$ are obtained with
the three methods for both instruments. The 1st method gives the best result, in agreement with a
model. The second method seems to be more sensitive to the Doppler shift of solar spectral lines with
respect to the telluric lines. The 3rd method makes use of umbra spectra which bias the result, but
it can be corrected for this a posteriori from results with the first method. The 3 methods clearly
show the spectral signature of the Rayleigh scattering in the Earth atmosphere and the bands of H$_2$O,
O$_2$, and O$_3$. Sodium is detected. Assuming no atmospheric perturbations, we show that the E-ELT
is theoretically able to detect the $O_2$ A-band in 8~h of integration for an Earth twin at 10pc.
