Short lived radionuclides (SLRs) like ^{26}Al are synthesized by massive stars and are a byproduct
of star formation. The abundances of SLRs in the gas of a star-forming galaxy is inversely proportional
to its gas consumption time. The rapid evolution of specific star formation rate (SSFR) of normal
galaxies implies they had mean SLR abundances ~3 - 10 times higher at z = 2. During the epoch of Solar
System formation, the background SLR abundances of the Galaxy were up to twice as high as at present,
if SLR yields from massive stars do not depend on metallicity. If SLRs are homogenized in the gas of
galaxies, the high SSFRs of normal galaxies can partly explain the elevated abundance of SLRs like
^{60}Fe and ^{26}Al in the early Solar System. Starburst galaxies have much higher SSFRs still,
and have enormous mean abundances of ^{26}Al (^{26}Al/^{27}Al ~ 10^-3 for Solar metallicity gas).
The main uncertainty is whether the SLRs are mixed with the star-forming molecular gas: they could
be trapped in hot gas and decay before entering the colder phases, or be blown out by starburst winds.
I consider how variability in star-formation rate affects the SLR abundances, and I discuss how
SLR transport may differ in these galaxies. The enhanced ^{26}Al of starbursts might maintain moderate
ionization rates (10^-18 - 10^-17 s^-1), possibly dominating ionization in dense clouds not penetrated
by cosmic rays. Similar ionization rates would be maintained in protoplanetary disks of starbursts,
if the SLRs are well-mixed, and the radiogenic heating of planetesimals would likewise be much higher.
In this way, galaxy evolution can affect the geological history of planetary systems.
