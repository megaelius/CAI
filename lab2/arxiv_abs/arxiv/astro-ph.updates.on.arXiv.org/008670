Aims: We want to detect and quantify observables related to accretion processes occurring locally
in circumstellar disks, which could be attributed to young forming planets. We focus on objects
known to host protoplanet candidates and/or disk structures thought to be the result of interactions
with planets. Methods: We analyzed observations of 6 young stars (age $3.5-10$ Myr) and their surrounding
environments with the SPHERE/ZIMPOL instrument on the VLT in the H$\alpha$ filter (656 nm) and a
nearby continuum filter (644.9 nm). Results: We re-detect the known accreting M-star companion
HD142527 B with the highest published signal to noise to date in both H$\alpha$ and the continuum.
We derive new astrometry ($r = 62.8^{+2.1}_{-2.7}$ mas and $\text{PA} = (98.7\,\pm1.8)^\circ$)
and photometry ($\Delta$N_Ha=$6.3^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$ mag, $\Delta$B_Ha=$6.7\pm0.2$ mag and $\Delta$Cnt_Ha=$7.3^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$
mag) for the companion in agreement with previous studies, and estimate its mass accretion rate
($\dot{M}\approx1-2\,\times10^{-10}\,M_\odot\text{ yr}^{-1}$). A faint point-like source
around HD135344 B (SAO206462) is also investigated, but a second deeper observation is required
to reveal its nature. No other companions are detected. In the framework of our assumptions we estimate
detection limits at the locations of companion candidates around HD100546, HD169142 and MWC758
and calculate that processes involving H$\alpha$ fluxes larger than $\sim8\times10^{-14}-10^{-15}\,\text{erg/s/cm}^2$
($\dot{M}>10^{-10}-10^{-12}\,M_\odot\text{ yr}^{-1}$) can be excluded. Furthermore, flux
upper limits of $\sim10^{-14}-10^{-15}\,\text{erg/s/cm}^2$ ($\dot{M}<10^{-11}-10^{-12}\,M_\odot
\text{ yr}^{-1}$) are estimated within the gaps identified in the disks surrounding HD135344B
and TW Hya.
