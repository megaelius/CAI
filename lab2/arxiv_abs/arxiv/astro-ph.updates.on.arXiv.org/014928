The Type IIn supernova (SN) 2005ip is one of the most well-studied and long-lasting examples of a
SN interacting with its circumstellar environment. The optical light curve plateaued at a nearly
constant level for more than five years, suggesting ongoing shock interaction with an extended
and clumpy circumstellar medium (CSM). Here we present continued observations of the SN from $\sim
1000-5000$ days post-explosion at all wavelengths, including X-ray, ultraviolet, near-infrared,
and mid-infrared. The UV spectra probe the pre-explosion mass loss and show evidence for CNO processing.
From the bolometric light curve, we find that the total radiated energy is in excess of $10^{50}$
erg, the progenitor star's pre-explosion mass-loss rate was $\gtrsim 1 \times 10^{-2}\,{\rm M_{\odot}~
yr}^{-1}$, and the total mass lost shortly before explosion was $\gtrsim 1\,{\rm M_\odot}$, though
the mass lost could have been considerably larger depending on the efficiency for the conversion
of kinetic energy to radiation. The ultraviolet through near-infrared spectrum is characterised
by two high density components, one with narrow high-ionisation lines, and one with broader low-ionisation
H I, He I, [O I], Mg II, and Fe II lines. The rich Fe II spectrum is strongly affected by Ly$\alpha$ fluorescence,
consistent with spectral modeling. Both the Balmer and He I lines indicate a decreasing CSM density
during the late interaction period. We find similarities to SN 1988Z, which shows a comparable change
in spectrum at around the same time during its very slow decline. These results suggest that, at long
last, the shock interaction in SN 2005ip may finally be on the decline.
