Cross-correlation is a well-tested method for exoplanet characterization. A new, potentially
powerful application is the measurement of atmospheric isotope ratios. In particular D/H can give
unique insights into a planet's formation and evolution. Here we aim to study the detectability
of isotopologues in the high-dispersion spectra of exoplanets, to identify the optimal wavelengths
ranges, and to predict the required observational efforts with current and future ground-based
instruments. High-dispersion (R=10$^5$) thermal emission (and sometimes reflection) spectra
were simulated by self-consistently modeling exoplanet atmospheres over a wide range of temperatures.
These were synthetically observed with telescopes equivalent to the VLT or ELT, and analyzed with
cross-correlation, resulting in S/N predictions for the detection of $^{13}$CO, HDO, and CH$_3$D.
For the best observable exoplanets, $^{13}$CO is in range of current telescopes. It will be most
favorably detected at 2.4 microns, just longward of the spectral range probed by several high-dispersion
observations in the literature. CH$_3$D can best be seen at 4.7 microns, using 40m-class telescopes
for planets with $T_{\rm equ}$ below 600 K. In this case, sky emission is often dominating the noise.
HDO can be targeted at 3.7 microns, where sky emission is smaller. 40m-class telescopes may detect
it in planets with $T_{\rm equ}$ below 900~K, potentially even 8m-class telescopes in the case of
methane quenching. If Proxima Cen b is water-rich, HDO could be detected with the ELT in 1 night in
reflected light. Isotopologues will soon belong to the exoplanet characterisation tools. Measuring
D/H, and ratios of other isotopes, could be a prime science case for the METIS instrument on the ELT,
especially for nearby rocky and ice giant planets. This can give unique insights in their history
of ice enrichment and atmospheric evaporation.
