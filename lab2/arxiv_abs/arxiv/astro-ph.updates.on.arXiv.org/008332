Recent observations of lensed sources have shown that the faintest ($M_{\mathrm{UV}} \approx
-15\,\mathrm{mag}$) galaxies observed at z=6-8 appear to be extremely compact. Some of them have
inferred sizes of less than 40 pc for stellar masses between $10^6$ and $10^7\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$,
comparable to individual super star clusters or star cluster complexes at low redshift. High-redshift,
low-mass galaxies are expected to show a clumpy, irregular morphology and if star clusters form
in each of these well-separated clumps, the observed galaxy size would be much larger than the size
of an individual star forming region. As supernova explosions impact the galaxy with a minimum delay
time that exceeds the time required to form a massive star cluster, other processes are required
to explain the absence of additional massive star forming regions. In this work we investigate whether
the radiation of a young massive star cluster can suppress the formation of other detectable clusters
within the same galaxy already before supernova feedback can affect the galaxy. We find that in low-mass
($M_{200} \lesssim 10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) haloes, the radiation from a compact star
forming region with an initial mass of $10^{7}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ can keep gas clumps with Jeans
masses larger than $\approx 10^{7}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ warm and ionized throughout the galaxy.
In this picture, the small intrinsic sizes measured in the faintest $z=6-8$ galaxies are a natural
consequence of the strong radiation field that stabilises massive gas clumps. A prediction of this
mechanism is that the escape fraction for ionizing radiation is high for the extremely compact,
high-z sources.
