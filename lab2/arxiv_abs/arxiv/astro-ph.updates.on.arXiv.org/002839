Gas-rich galaxies in dense environments such as galaxy clusters and massive groups are affected
by a number of possible types of interactions with the cluster environment, which make their evolution
radically different than that of field galaxies. The dIrr galaxy NGC 1427A, presently infalling
towards the core of the Fornax galaxy cluster, offers a unique opportunity to study those processes
in a level of detail not possible to achieve for galaxies at higher redshifts. Using HST/ACS and auxiliary
VLT/FORS ground-based observations, we study the properties of the most recent episodes of star
formation in this gas-rich galaxy, the only one of its type near the core of the Fornax cluster. We
study the structural and photometric properties of young star cluster complexes in NGC 1427A, identifying
12 bright such complexes with exceptionally blue colors. The comparison of our broadband near-UV/optical
photometry with simple stellar population models yields ages below ~4x10^6 yr and stellar masses
from a few thousand up to ~3x10^4 Msun, slightly dependent on the assumption of cluster metallicity
and IMF. Their grouping is consistent with hierarchical and fractal star cluster formation. We
use deep Ha imaging data to determine the current Star Formation Rate (SFR) in NGC 1427A and estimate
the ratio, Gamma, of star formation occurring in these star cluster complexes to that in the entire
galaxy. We find Gamma to be exceptionally large, even after conservatively accounting for the possibility
of contamination from intra-cluster light and other modelling uncertainties, implying that recent
star formation predominantly occurred in star cluster complexes. This is the first time such high
star cluster formation efficiency is reported in a dwarf galaxy within the confines of a galaxy cluster,
strongly hinting at the possibility that is being triggered by its passage through the cluster environment.
