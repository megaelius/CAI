We present new measurements of the intensity of the ionizing ultraviolet background and the global
emissivity of ionizing photons over 2 < z < 5. Our results are based on updated measurements
of physical properties of the high-redshift intergalactic medium (IGM), including gas temperatures
and the opacity of the IGM to Ly-alpha and ionizing photons. The results are then used to investigate
trends in the ionizing efficiency of galaxies in the post-reionization epoch. Consistent with
previous works, we find a relatively flat hydrogen photoionization rate over 2 < z < 5, although
our measurements are roughly a factor of two higher than the 2008 values of Faucher-Giguere et al.,
due primarily to our lower IGM temperatures. The ionizing emissivity we derive is also generally
higher than other recent estimates due to lower temperatures, higher ionizing opacity, and an accounting
of cosmological radiative transfer effects. We find evidence that the emissivity increases from
z~3 to 5, reaching ~5 ionizing photons/atom/Gyr at z=4.75 for realistic galaxy spectra. We further
find that galaxies must dominate the emissivity near 1 Ryd at z > 4, and possibly at all redshifts
z > 2.4. Our results suggest that the average ionizing "efficiency" of star-forming galaxies
increases substantially with redshift over 3.2 < z < 4.75. This is consistent with the conclusion
often drawn from reionization models that the ionizing efficiency of galaxies must be higher during
reionization than at lower redshifts in order for galaxies to reionize the IGM by z=6. Our emissivity
values at z~5 suggest that ionizing photons may have been a factor of two more abundant during the
final stages of reionization than previously indicated. The evolution of the emissivity suggests,
moreover, that the steep decline in the photoionization rate from z~5 to 6 may indicate a rapid evolution
in the mean free path. [Abridged]
