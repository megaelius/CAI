The perturbations in the early universe are generated as a result of the interplay between quantum
field theory and gravitation. Since these primordial perturbations lead to the anisotropies in
the cosmic microwave background and eventually to the inhomogeneities in the Large Scale Structure
(LSS), they provide a unique opportunity to probe issues which are fundamental to our understanding
of quantum physics and gravitation. One such fundamental issue that remains to be satisfactorily
addressed is the transition of the primordial perturbations from their quantum origins to the LSS
which can be characterized completely in terms of classical quantities. Bouncing universes provide
an alternative to the more conventional inflationary paradigm as they can help overcome the horizon
problem in a fashion very similar to inflation. While the problem of the quantum-to-classical transition
of the primordial perturbations has been investigated extensively in the context of inflation,
we find that there has been a rather limited effort towards studying the issue in bouncing universes.
In this work, we analyze certain aspects of this problem with the example of tensor perturbations
produced in bouncing universes. We investigate the issue mainly from two perspectives. Firstly,
we approach the problem by examining the extent of squeezing of a quantum state associated with the
tensor perturbations with the help of the Wigner function. Secondly, we analyze this issue from
the perspective of the quantum measurement problem. In particular, we study the effects of wave
function collapse, using a phenomenological model known as continuous spontaneous localization,
on the tensor power spectra. We conclude with a discussion of results.
