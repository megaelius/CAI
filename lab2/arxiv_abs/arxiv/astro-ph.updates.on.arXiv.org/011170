Context. Polarimetric imaging is one of the most effective techniques for high-contrast imaging
and characterization of protoplanetary disks, and has the potential to be instrumental in characterizing
exoplanets. VLT/SPHERE contains the InfraRed Dual-band Imager and Spectrograph (IRDIS) with
a dual-beam polarimetric imaging (DPI) mode, which offers the capability to obtain linear polarization
images at high contrast and resolution. Aims. We aim to provide an overview of IRDIS/DPI and study
its optical design to improve observing strategies and data reduction. Methods. For H-band observations
of TW Hya, we compare two data reduction methods that correct for instrumental polarization effects
in different ways: a minimization of the noise image, and a polarimetric-model-based correction
method that we present in Paper II of this study. Results. We use observations of TW Hya to illustrate
the data reduction. In the images of the protoplanetary disk around this star we detect variability
in the polarized intensity and angle of linear polarization with pointing-dependent instrument
configuration. We explain these variations as instrumental polarization effects and correct
for these effects using our model-based correction method. Conclusions. IRDIS/DPI has proven
to be a very successful and productive high-contrast polarimetric imaging system. However, the
instrument performance depends on the specific instrument configuration. We suggest adjustments
to future observing strategies to optimize polarimetric efficiency in field tracking mode by avoiding
unfavourable derotator angles. We recommend reducing on-sky data with the pipeline called IRDAP
that includes the model-based correction method (described in Paper II) to optimally account for
the remaining telescope and instrumental polarization effects and to retrieve the true polarization
state of the incident light.
