Observing sequences have shown that the major noise source limitation in high-contrast imaging
is due to the presence of quasi-static speckles. The timescale on which quasi-static speckles evolve,
is determined by various factors, among others mechanical or thermal deformations. Understanding
of these time-variable instrumental speckles, and especially their interaction with other aberrations,
referred to as the pinning effect, is paramount for the search of faint stellar companions. The temporal
evolution of quasi-static speckles is for instance required for a quantification of the gain expected
when using angular differential imaging (ADI), and to determine the interval on which speckle nulling
techniques must be carried out. Following an early analysis of a time series of adaptively corrected,
coronagraphic images obtained in a laboratory condition with the High-Order Test bench (HOT) at
ESO Headquarters, we confirm our results with new measurements carried out with the SPHERE instrument
during its final test phase in Europe. The analysis of the residual speckle pattern in both direct
and differential coronagraphic images enables the characterization of the temporal stability
of quasi-static speckles. Data were obtained in a thermally actively controlled environment reproducing
realistic conditions encountered at the telescope. The temporal evolution of the quasi-static
wavefront error exhibits linear power law, which can be used to model quasi-static speckle evolution
in the context of forthcoming high-contrast imaging instruments, with implications for instrumentation
(design, observing strategies, data reduction). Such a model can be used for instance to derive
the timescale on which non-common path aberrations must be sensed and corrected. We found in our
data that quasi-static wavefront error increases with ~0.7 angstrom per minute.
