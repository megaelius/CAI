We present an optical to near-infrared selected astronomical catalogue covering 1270 deg.$^2$.
This is the first attempt to systematically combine data from 23 of the premier extragalactic survey
fields - the product of a vast investment of telescope time. The fields are those imaged by the Herschel
Space Observatory which form the Herschel Extragalactic Legacy Project (HELP). Our catalogue
of 170 million objects is constructed by a positional cross match of 51 public surveys. This high
resolution optical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared catalogue is designed for photometric redshift
estimation, extraction of fluxes in lower resolution far-infrared maps, and spectral energy distribution
modelling. It collates, standardises, and provides value added derived quantities including
corrected aperture magnitudes and astrometry correction over the Herschel extragalactic wide
fields for the first time. $grizy$ fluxes are available on all fields with $g$ band data reaching
$5\sigma$ point-source depths in a 2 arcsec aperture of 23.5, 24.4, and 24.6 (AB) mag at the 25th,
50th, and 75th percentiles, by area covered, across all HELP fields. It has $K$ or $K_s$ coverage
over 1146 deg.$^2$ with depth percentiles of 20.2, 20.4, and 21.0 mag respectively. The IRAC Ch 1
band is available over 273 deg.$^2$ with depth percentiles of 17.7, 21.4, and 22.2 mag respectively.
This paper defines the ``masterlist'' objects for the first data release (DR1) of HELP. This large
sample of standardised total and corrected aperture fluxes, uniform quality flags, and completeness
measures provides large well understood statistical samples over the full Herschel extragalactic
sky.
