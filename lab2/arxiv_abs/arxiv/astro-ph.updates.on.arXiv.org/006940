NGC 3311, the central galaxy of the Hydra I cluster, shows signatures of recent infall of satellite
galaxies from the cluster environment. Previous work has shown that the line-of-sight velocity
dispersion of the stars and globular clusters in the extended halo of NGC 3311 rises up to the value
of the cluster velocity dispersion. We performed multi-object spectroscopic observations of
the diffuse stellar halo of NGC 3311 using VLT/FORS2 in MXU mode to mimic a coarse `IFU'. We use pPXF
to extract the kinematic information. We find a homogeneous velocity and velocity dispersion field
within r<10 kpc. Beyond this radius, both the velocities and dispersions start to depend on azimuth
angle and show a significant intrinsic scatter. The inner spheroid of NGC 3311 can be described as
a slow rotator. Outside 10 kpc the cumulative angular momentum is rising. If the radial dependence
alone is considered, the velocity dispersion does not simply rise but fills an increasingly large
range of values with two well defined envelopes. The lower envelope is about constant at 200 km/s.
The upper envelope rises smoothly, joining the velocity dispersion of the outer cluster galaxies.
We interpret this behaviour as the superposition of tracer populations with increasingly shallower
radial distributions between the extremes of the inner stellar populations and the cluster galaxies.
Simple Jeans models illustrate that a range of of mass profiles with different anisotropies can
account for all observed velocity dispersions, including radial MOND models. Jeans models using
one tracer population with a unique density profile are not able to explain the large range of the
observed kinematics. Previous claims about the cored dark halo of NGC 3311 are therefore probably
not valid. This may in general apply to central cluster galaxies with rising velocity dispersion
profiles, where infall processes are important.
