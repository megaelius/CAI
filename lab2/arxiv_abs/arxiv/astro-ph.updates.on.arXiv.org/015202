KIC 9406652 is a cataclysmic variable (CV), sub-classified as `IW And-type star', showing a repetition
of standstills with oscillatory variations terminated by brightening. This system showed negative
superhumps, semi-periodic variations having periods slightly shorter than the orbital period,
and super-orbital signals, both of which are believed to originate from a precessing, tilted accretion
disk. We have re-examined its Kepler light curve extending over 1500 d. In accordance with a cycle
of the IW And-type light variation, the frequency of negative superhumps showed a reproducible
variation: a rapid drop during the brightening and a gradual increase during the standstill. They
are interpreted as the drastic change in the radial mass distribution and the expansion of the tilted
disk, which is not expected from the existing models for IW And stars. The constancy in flux amplitudes
of negative superhumps confirms that their light source is the bright spot sweeping across the surface
of the tilted disk. The frequencies of negative superhumps and super-orbital signals varied in
unison on long timescales, suggesting their common origin: the tilted disk. Orbital signals at
the brightening were dominated by the irradiation of the secondary star and varied with the orientation
of the tilted disk; the amplitude was maximized at the minimum of super-orbital signals and the light
maximum shifted to early orbital phases as the super-orbital phase advances. This is the first direct
evidence that the disk was tilted out of the binary orbital plane and retrogradely precessing. The
tilt angle of the disk inferred from semi-amplitudes of super-orbital signals was lower than 3 degrees.
The diversity in light curves of negative superhumps supports this and suggests that a part of the
gas stream overflows the disk edge. This study thus offers rich information about the tilted disk
in CVs.
