Aim: In the past, observations of protostellar shocks have been able to set constraints on the formation
route of formamide (NH2CHO), exploiting its observed spatial distribution and comparison with
astrochemical model predictions. In this work, we follow the same strategy to study the case of acetaldehyde
(CH3CHO). Method: To this end, we used the data obtained with the IRAM-NOEMA interferometer in the
framework of the Large Program SOLIS to image the B0 and B1 shocks along the L1157 blueshifted outflow
in methanol (CH3OH) and acetaldehyde line emission. Results: We imaged six CH3OH and eight CH3CHO
lines which cover upper level energies up to 30 K. Both species trace the B0 molecular cavity as well
as the northern B1 portion, i.e. the regions where the youngest shocks (1000 yr) occurred. The CH$_3$OH
and CH$_3$CHO emission peaks towards the B1b clump, where we measured the following column densities
and relative abundances: 1.3 x 10^16 cm-2 and 6.5 x 10-6 (methanol), and 7 x 10^13 cm-2 and 3.5 x 10-8
(acetaldehyde). We carried out a non-LTE LVG analysis of the observed CH3OH line: the average kinetic
temperature and density of the emitting gas are Tkin = 90 K and nH2 = 4 x 10^5 cm-3, respectively. The
CH3OH and CH3CHO abundance ratio towards B1b is 190, varying by less than a factor 3 throughout the
whole B0-B1 structure. Conclusions: The comparison of astrochemical model predictions with the
observed methanol and acetaldehyde spatial distribution does not allow to distinguish whether
acetaldehyde is formed on the grain mantles or rather on the gas-phase, as its gas-phase formation,
dominated by the reaction of ethyl radical (CH3CH2) with atomic oxygen, is very fast. Observations
of acetaldehyde in younger shocks, e.g. 10^2 yr old, or/and of the ethyl radical, whose frequencies
are not presently available, are necessary to settle the issue.
