We present results from the major coordinated X-ray observing program on the ULX NGC 1313 X-1 performed
in 2017, combining $XMM$-$Newton$, $Chandra$ and $NuSTAR$, focusing on the evolution of the broadband
($\sim$0.3-30.0 keV) continuum emission. Clear and unusual spectral variability is observed,
but this is markedly suppressed above $\sim$10-15 keV, qualitatively similar to the ULX Holmberg
IX X-1. We model the multi-epoch data with two-component accretion disc models designed to approximate
super-Eddington accretion, allowing for the possibility of both a black hole and a neutron star
accretor. With regards to the hotter disc component, the data trace out two distinct tracks in the
luminosity-temperature plane, with larger emitting radii and lower temperatures seen at higher
observed fluxes. Despite this apparent anti-correlation, each of these tracks individually shows
a positive luminosity-temperature relation. Both are broadly consistent with $L\propto{T}^{4}$,
as expected for blackbody emission with a constant emitting area, and also with $L\propto{T}^{2}$,
as may be expected for an advection-dominated disc around a black hole. We consider a variety of different
possibilities that may explain this unusual behaviour. Scenarios in which the innermost flow is
suddenly blocked from view by outer regions of the super-Eddington disc/wind can explain the luminosity-temperature
behaviour, but are difficult to reconcile with the lack of strong variability at higher energies,
assuming that this emission arises from the most compact regions. Instead, we may be seeing evidence
for further radial stratification of the accretion flow than is included in the simple models considered,
with a combination of winds and advection resulting in the suppressed high-energy variability.
