Accretion conditions and morphologies of X-ray transients containing neutron stars are still
poorly understood. Circinus X-1 is an enigmatic case where we observe X-ray flux changes covering
four orders of magnitude. We observed Circinus X-1 several times at its very lowest X-ray flux using
the high energy transmission grating spectrometer on board the Chandra X-ray Observatory. At a
flux of 1.8$\times10^{-11}$ \ergcm we observed a single 1.6 keV blackbody spectrum. The observed
continuum luminosity of 10$^{35}$ \ergsec is about two orders of magnitude too low to explain the
observed photoionized luminosity suggesting a much more complex structure of the X-ray source
which is partially or entirely obscured as had been previously suggested. This affects most emissions
from the accretion disk including previously observed accretion disk coronal line emissions.
Instead, the strongest observed photoionized lines are blueshifted by about $\sim 400$ \kms\ and
we suggest that they originate in the ionized wind of a B5Ia supergaint companion supporting a previous
identification. The neutron star in Cir X-1 is very young and should have a high magnetic field. At
the observed luminosity the emission radius of the blackbody is small enough to be associated with
the accretion hot spot as the X-ray emitting region. The small emission radius then points to a field
strength below $10^{12}$ G which would be consistent with the observation of occasional type I X-ray
bursts at high magnetic fields. We discuss Cir X-1 in the context of being a high-mass X-ray binary
with some emphasis on a possible Be-star X-ray binary nature.
