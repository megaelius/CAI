Infrared observations of metastable 2$^3$S helium absorption with ground- and space-based spectroscopy
are rapidly maturing, as this species is a unique probe of exoplanet atmospheres. Specifically,
the transit depth in the triplet feature (with vacuum wavelengths near 1083.3 nm) can be used to constrain
the temperature and mass loss rate of an exoplanet's upper atmosphere. Here, we present a new photometric
technique to measure metastable 2$^3$S helium absorption using an ultra-narrowband filter (full-width
at half-maximum of 0.635 nm) coupled to a beam-shaping diffuser installed in the Wide-field Infrared
Camera (WIRC) on the 200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory. We use telluric OH lines and
a helium arc lamp to characterize refractive effects through the filter and to confirm our understanding
of the filter transmission profile. We benchmark our new technique by observing a transit of WASP-69b
and detect an excess absorption of $0.498\pm0.045$% (11.1$\sigma$), consistent with previous
measurements after considering our bandpass. Then, we use this method to study the inflated gas
giant WASP-52b and place a 95th-percentile upper limit on excess absorption in our helium bandpass
of 0.47%. Using an atmospheric escape model, we constrain the mass loss rate for WASP-69b to be $5.25^{+0.65}_{-0.46}\times10^{-4}~M_\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{Gyr}$
($3.32^{+0.67}_{-0.56}\times10^{-3}~M_\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{Gyr}$) at 7,000 K (12,000 K).
Additionally, we set an upper limit on the mass loss rate of WASP-52b at these temperatures of $2.1\times10^{-4}~M_\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{Gyr}$
($2.1\times10^{-3}~M_\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{Gyr}$). These results show that ultra-narrowband
photometry can reliably quantify absorption in the metastable helium feature.
