Recent observations have successfully detected UV-bright and infrared-bright galaxies in the
epoch of reionization. However, the origin of their radiative properties has not been understood
yet. Combining cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and radiative transfer calculations,
we present predictions of multi-wavelength radiative properties of the first galaxies at $z\sim
6-15$. Using zoom-in initial conditions, we investigate three massive galaxies and their satellites
in different environment and halo masses: $M_{\rm h} = 2.4\times 10^{10}{\rm M_{\odot}}$ (Halo-10),
$1.6\times 10^{11}{\rm M_{\odot}}$ (Halo-11) and $0.7\times 10^{12}{\rm M_{\odot}}$ (Halo-12)
at $z=6$. We find that most of gas and dust are ejected from star-forming regions by supernova feedback,
which allows UV photons to escape. We show that the peak of the spectral energy distribution (SED)
rapidly changes between UV and infrared wavelengths on a time-scale of $\sim$\,100\,Myrs due to
intermittent star formation and feedback, and the escape fraction of UV photons fluctuates in the
range of $0.2-0.8$ at $z<10$ with a time-averaged value of 0.3. When dusty gas covers the star-forming
regions, the galaxies become bright in the observed-frame sub-millimeter wavelengths. We predict
the detectability of high-$z$ galaxies with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). For a sensitivity
limit of $0.1\,{\rm mJy}$ at $850\,{\rm \mu m}$, the detection probability of galaxies in halos
$M_{\rm h} \gtrsim 10^{11}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ at $z\lesssim 7$ exceeds fifty per cent. We argue
that supernova feedback can produce the observed diversity of SEDs for high-$z$ galaxies.
