We report the detection of the radio afterglow of a long gamma-ray burst (GRB) 111005A at 5-345 GHz,
including the very long baseline interferometry observations with the positional error of 0.2
mas. The afterglow position is coincident with the disk of a galaxy ESO 580-49 at z= 0.01326 (~1" from
its center), which makes GRB 111005A the second closest GRB known to date, after GRB 980425. The radio
afterglow of GRB 111005A was an order of magnitude less luminous than those of local low-luminosity
GRBs, and obviously than those of cosmological GRBs. The radio flux was approximately constant
and then experienced an unusually rapid decay a month after the GRB explosion. Similarly to only
two other GRBs, we did not find the associated supernovae (SN), despite deep near- and mid-infrared
observations 1-9 days after the GRB explosion, reaching ~20 times fainter than other SNe associated
with GRBs. Moreover, we measured twice solar metallicity for the GRB location. The low gamma-ray
and radio luminosities, rapid decay, lack of a SN, and super-solar metallicity suggest that GRB
111005A represents a different rare class of GRBs than typical core-collapse events. We modelled
the spectral energy distribution of the GRB 111005A host finding that it is a dwarf, moderately star-forming
galaxy, similar to the host of GRB 980425. The existence of two local GRBs in such galaxies is still
consistent with the hypothesis that the GRB rate is proportional to the cosmic star formation rate
(SFR) density, but suggests that the GRB rate is biased towards low SFRs. Using the far-infrared
detection of ESO 580-49, we conclude that the hosts of both GRBs 111005A and 980425 exhibit lower
dust content than what would be expected from their stellar masses and optical colours.
