We obtained K-band spectroscopy of the brightest members of the cluster VVV CL074 in order to identify
the massive star population. We also determined the stellar properties of the cluster's massive
stars to better quantify the evolutionary sequences linking different types of massive stars.
We collected integral field spectroscopy of selected fields in the cluster VVV CL074 with SINFONI
on the ESO/VLT. We performed a spectral classification based on the K-band spectra and comparison
to infrared spectral atlases. We determined the stellar parameters of the massive stars from analysis
with atmosphere models computed with the code CMFGEN. We uncover a population of 25 early-type (OB
and Wolf-Rayet) stars, 19 being newly discovered by our observations out of which 15 are likely cluster
members. The cluster's spectrophotometric distance is 10.2+/-1.6 kpc, placing it close to the
intersection of the galactic bar and the Norma arm, beyond the galactic center. This makes VVV CL074
one the farthest young massive clusters identified so far. Among the massive stars population,
three objects are Wolf-Rayet stars, the remaining are O and B stars. From the Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram we find that most stars have an age between 3 and 6 Myr according to the Geneva evolutionary
tracks. WN8 and WC8-9 stars are the descendants of stars with initial masses between 40 and 60 Msun.
The massive star population of VVV CL074 is very similar to that of the cluster DBS2003-179 and to
a lesser extent to that of the Quintuplet cluster, indicating the same age. The central cluster of
the Galaxy is ~3 Myr older. From the comparison of the massive stars populations in these four clusters,
one concludes that galactic stars with an initial mass in the range 40 to 60 Msun likely go through
a WN8-9 phase.
