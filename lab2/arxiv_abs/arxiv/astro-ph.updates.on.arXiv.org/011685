The size and composition of dust grains are critical in setting the dynamical, physical and chemical
evolution of the media in which they are present. Thanks to facilities such as ALMA and in the future
the SKA, their thermal emission in the (sub)mm to cm has become a convenient way to trace grain properties.
Our aim is to understand the influence of the grain composition and size distribution on the shape
of their SED in dense ISM regions such as molecular clouds, prestellar cores, YSOs and protoplanetary
discs. Starting from the optical constants defined in the THEMIS model for amorphous hydrogenated
carbon and silicate grains in addition to water ice, we define 6 material mixtures representative
of the expected dust composition in dense ISM regions. The optical properties of 0.01 micron to 10
cm grains are then calculated with effective medium and Mie theories. The corresponding SEDs are
calculated for isolated clouds either externally heated by the ISRF alone or in addition to an internal
source. The 3 main outcomes of this study are as follows. First, the dust mass absorption coefficient
strongly depends on both its composition and size distribution potentially leading to errors in
dust mass estimates by factors up to 3 and 20, respectively. Second, it appears almost impossible
to retrieve the grain composition from the (sub)mm to cm SED shape alone as its spectral index for
lambda > 3 mm does not depend on composition. Third, using the true dust opacity spectral index to
estimate grain sizes may lead to erroneous findings as the observed spectral index can be highly
modified by the dust temperature distribution along the line-of-sight, which depends on the specific
heating source and on the geometry of the studied region. Based on the interpretation of only the
spectral shape of (sub)mm to cm SEDs, the determination of the dust masses, compositions and sizes
are highly uncertain.
