Galaxy clusters are a recent cosmological probe. The precision and accuracy of the cosmological
parameters inferred from these objects are affected by the knowledge of cluster physics, entering
the analysis through the mass-observable scaling relations, and the theoretical description
of their mass and redshift distribution, modelled by the mass function. In this work, we forecast
the impact of different modelling of these ingredients for clusters detected by future optical
and near-IR surveys. We consider the standard cosmological scenario and the case with a time-dependent
equation of state for dark energy. We analyse the effect of increasing accuracy on the scaling relation
calibration, finding improved constraints on the cosmological parameters. This higher accuracy
exposes the impact of the mass function evaluation, which is a subdominant source of systematics
for current data. We compare two different evaluations for the mass function. In both cosmological
scenarios, the use of different mass functions leads to biases in the parameter constraints. For
the $\Lambda$CDM model, we find a $1.6 \, \sigma$ shift in the $(\Omega_m,\sigma_8)$ parameter
plane and a discrepancy of $\sim 7 \, \sigma$ for the redshift evolution of the scatter of the scaling
relations. For the scenario with a time-evolving dark energy equation of state, the assumption
of different mass functions results in a $\sim 8 \, \sigma$ tension in the $w_0$ parameter. These
results show the impact, and the necessity for a precise modelling, of the interplay between the
redshift evolution of the mass function and of the scaling relations in the cosmological analysis
of galaxy clusters.
