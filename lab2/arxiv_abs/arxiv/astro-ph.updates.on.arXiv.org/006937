To what extent can the one-dimensional slim disk model reproduce the multi-dimensional results
of global radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of super-Eddington accretion? With this question
in mind, we perform systematic simulation study of accretion flow onto a non-spinning black hole
for a variety of black hole masses of $(10 - 10^7) M_{\odot}$ and mass accretion rates of $(1.4 \times
10^2 - 5.6 \times 10^3)L_{\rm Edd}/c^2$ (with $L_{\rm Edd}$ and $c$ being the Eddington luminosity
and speed of light). In order to adequately resolve large-scale outflow structure, we extensively
expand a simulation box to cover the space of $3000 r_{\rm S}$ (with $r_{\rm S}$ being the Schwarzschild
radius), larger than those in most previous studies, so that we can put relatively large angular
momentum to the gas injected from the outer simulation boundary. The adopted Keplerian radius,
at which the centrifugal force balances with the gravitational force, is $r_{\rm K}=300 r_{\rm
S}$. The injected mass first falls and is accumulated at around this radius and then slowly accretes
towards the central black hole via viscosity. We simulate such accretion processes, taking inverse
and bulk Compton scattering into account. The simulated accretion flow is in a quasi-steady state
inside $r_{\rm qss}\sim 200 r_{\rm S}$. Within this radius the flow properties are, as a whole, in
good agreement with those described by the slim disk model except that the radial density profile
of the underlying disk is much flatter, $\rho\propto r^{-0.73}$ (cf. $\rho\propto r^{-3/2}$ in
the slim disk model), due probably to efficient convection. We find very weak outflow from inside
$r\sim 200 r_{\rm S}$ unlike the past studies.
