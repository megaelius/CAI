Though generated deep inside the convection zone, the solar magnetic field has a direct impact on
the Earth space environment via the Parker spiral. It strongly modulates the solar wind in the whole
heliosphere, especially its latitudinal and longitudinal speed distribution over the years.
However the wind also influences the topology of the coronal magnetic field by opening the magnetic
field lines in the coronal holes, which can affect the inner magnetic field of the star by altering
the dynamo boundary conditions. This coupling is especially difficult to model because it covers
a large variety of spatio-temporal scales. Quasi-static studies have begun to help us unveil how
the dynamo-generated magnetic field shapes the wind, but the full interplay between the solar dynamo
and the solar wind still eludes our understanding. We use the compressible magnetohydrodynamical
(MHD) code PLUTO to compute simultaneously in 2.5D the generation and evolution of magnetic field
inside the star via an alpha-Omega dynamo process and the corresponding evolution of a polytropic
coronal wind over several activity cycles for a young Sun. A multi-layered boundary condition at
the surface of the star connects the inner and outer stellar layers, allowing both to adapt dynamically.
Our continuously coupled dynamo-wind model allows us to characterize how the solar wind conditions
change as a function of the cycle phase, and also to quantify the evolution of integrated quantities
such as the Alfv\'en radius. We further assess the impact of the solar wind on the dynamo itself by
comparing our results with and without wind feedback.
