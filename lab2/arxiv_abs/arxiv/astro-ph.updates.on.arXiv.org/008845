We analyse the kinematics of the Galactic bar-bulge using proper motions from the ESO public survey
Vista Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) and the second Gaia data release. Gaia has provided some of
the first absolute proper motions within the bulge and the near-infrared VVV multi-epoch catalogue
complements Gaia in highly-extincted low-latitude regions. We discuss the relative-to-absolute
calibration of the VVV proper motions using Gaia. Along lines of sight spanning $-10<\ell/\,\mathrm{deg}<10$
and $-10<b/\,\mathrm{deg}<5$, we probabilistically model the density and velocity distributions
as a function of distance of $\sim45$ million stars. The transverse velocities confirm the rotation
signature of the bar seen in spectroscopic surveys. The differential rotation between the double
peaks of the magnitude distribution confirms the X-shaped nature of the bar-bulge. Both transverse
velocity components increase smoothly along the near-side of the bar towards the Galactic centre,
peak at the Galactic centre and decline on the far-side. The anisotropy is $\sigma_\ell/\sigma_b\approx1.1-1.3$
within the bulk of the bar, reducing to $0.9-1.1$ when rotational broadening is accounted for, and
exhibits a clear X-shaped signature. The vertex deviation in $\ell$ and $b$ is significant $|\rho_{\ell
b}|\lesssim0.2$, greater on the near-side of the bar and produces a quadrupole signature across
the bulge indicating approximate radial alignment. We have re-constructed the 3D kinematics from
the assumption of triaxiality, finding good agreement with spectroscopic survey results. In the
co-rotating frame, we find evidence of bar-supporting x1 orbits and tangential bias in the in-plane
dispersion field.
