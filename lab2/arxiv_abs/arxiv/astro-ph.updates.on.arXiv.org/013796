We present a study on the radial profiles of D4000, luminosity-weighted stellar ages $\tau_L$ and
metallicities $[Z/H]_L$ of 3654 nearby galaxies ($0.01<z<0.15$) using the IFU spectroscopic
data from the SDSS DR15 MaNGA data release, in an effort to explore the connection between median
stellar population radial gradients (i.e., $\nabla$D4000,$\nabla\tau_L,\nabla [Z/H]_L$)
out to $\sim 1.5R_e$ and various galaxy properties, including stellar mass ($M_{\star}$), specific
star formation rate (sSFR), morphologies and local environment. We find that $M_{\star}$ is the
single most predictive physical property for $\nabla$D4000 and $\nabla [Z/H]_L$. The most predictive
properties for $\nabla\tau_L$ are sSFR and to a lesser degree, $M_{\star}$. The environmental
parameters, including local galaxy overdensities and central-satellite division, have virtually
no correlation with stellar population radial profiles for whole sample, but $\nabla$D4000 of
star-forming satellite galaxies with $M_{\star}\lesssim 10^{10}M_\odot$ exhibit a significant
positive correlation with galaxy overdensities. Galaxies with lower sSFR have on average steeper
negative stellar population gradients, and this sSFR dependence is stronger for more massive star-forming
galaxies. The negative correlation between median stellar population gradients and $M_{\star}$
are best described largely as segmented relationships, whereby median gradients of galaxies with
$\log M_{\star}\lesssim 10$ (with the exact value depending on sSFR) have much weaker mass dependence
than galaxies with higher $M_{\star}$.While the dependence of radial gradients of ages and metallicities
on T-Types and central stellar mass surface densities are generally not significant, galaxies
with later T-Types or lower central mass densities tend to have significantly lower D4000, younger
$\tau_L$ and lower $[Z/H]_L$ across the radial ranges probed in this study.
