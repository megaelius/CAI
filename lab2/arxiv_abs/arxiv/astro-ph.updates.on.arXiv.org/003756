(in english): Urbain-Jean-Joseph Le Verrier was born in Saint-L\^o on March 11, 1811. He entered
the Ecole Polytechnique in 1831, from which he was to emerge 8th two years later. After first devoting
himself to chemistry, in 1836 he obtained a position as an astronomy assistant at the Ecole Polytechnique.
This choice will decide his future career which culminates with the discovery of Neptune in 1846.
Le Verrier wrote more than 200 contributions in the Comptes Rendus de l'Acad\'emie des Sciences.
These contributions are very varied: some original articles but also reports on publications published
elsewhere, sometimes even simple notes of a single page. The whole set gives a very vivid vision of
the development of the science of the XIXth century. At that time, the Comptes Rendus are really a
reflection of the debates of the sessions of the Academy. They are published very quickly, and leave
a large freedom of speech to the authors. They are therefore a snapshot of the sometimes lively polemics
which animated the sessions of the Academy of Sciences. In this limited essay, we will look to the
first years of the career of Le Verrier until the discovery of Neptune. (in french) Le Verrier a \'ecrit
plus de 200 contributions dans les Comptes Rendus de l'Acad\'emie des Sciences . Ces contributions
sont le reflet des d\'ebats des s\'eances de l'Acad\'emie. Ils sont publi\'es tr\`es rapidement,
et laissent une tr\`es grande libert\'e de parole aux auteurs. On y retrouve de mani\`ere instantan\'ee
les pol\'emiques parfois vives qui ont anim\'e les s\'eances de l'Acad\'emie des sciences. Dans
cet essai nous survolerons les premi\`eres ann\'ees de la carri\`ere de Le Verrier jusqu'\`a la
d\'ecouverte de Neptune.
