We present Hubble Space Telescope Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer coronagraphic
imaging polarimetry of the TW Hydrae protoplanetary disk. These observations simultaneously
measure the total and polarized intensity, allowing direct measurement of the polarization fraction
across the disk. In accord with the self-shadowing hypothesis recently proposed by Debes et al.,
we find that the total and polarized intensity of the disk exhibits strong azimuthal asymmetries
at projected distances consistent with the previously reported bright and dark ring-shaped structures
(~45-99 au). The sinusoidal-like variations possess a maximum brightness at position angles near
~268-300 degrees and are up to ~28% stronger in total intensity. Furthermore, significant radial
and azimuthal variations are also detected in the polarization fraction of the disk. In particular,
we find that regions of lower polarization fraction are associated with annuli of increased surface
brightness, suggesting that the relative proportion of multiple-to-single scattering is greater
along the ring and gap structures. Moreover, we find strong (~20%) azimuthal variation in the polarization
fraction along the shadowed region of the disk. Further investigation reveals that the azimuthal
variation is not the result of disk flaring effects, but instead from a decrease in the relative contribution
of multiple-to-single scattering within the shadowed region. Employing a two-layer scattering
surface, we hypothesize that the diminished contribution in multiple scattering may result from
shadowing by an inclined inner disk, which prevents direct stellar light from reaching the optically
thick underlying surface component.
