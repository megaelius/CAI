Existing models of galaxy formation have not yet explained striking correlations between structure
and star-formation activity in galaxies, notably the sloped and moving boundaries that divide
star-forming from quenched galaxies in key structural diagrams. This paper uses these and other
relations to ``reverse-engineer'' the quenching process for central galaxies. The basic idea
is that star-forming galaxies with larger radii (at a given stellar mass) have lower black-hole
masses due to lower central densities. Galaxies cross into the green valley when the cumulative
effective energy radiated by their black hole equals $\sim4\times$ their halo-gas binding energy.
Since larger-radii galaxies have smaller black holes, one finds they must evolve to higher stellar
masses in order to meet this halo-energy criterion, which explains the sloping boundaries. A possible
cause of radii differences among star-forming galaxies is halo concentration. The evolutionary
tracks of star-forming galaxies are nearly parallel to the green-valley boundaries, and it is mainly
the sideways motions of these boundaries with cosmic time that cause galaxies to quench. BH-scaling
laws for star-forming, quenched, and green-valley galaxies are different, and most BH mass growth
takes place in the green valley. Implications include: the radii of star-forming galaxies are an
important second parameter in shaping their black holes; black holes are connected to their halos
but in different ways for star-forming, quenched, and green-valley galaxies; and the same BH-halo
quenching mechanism has been in place since $z \sim 3$. We conclude with a discussion of black hole-galaxy
co-evolution, the origin and interpretation of BH scaling laws.
