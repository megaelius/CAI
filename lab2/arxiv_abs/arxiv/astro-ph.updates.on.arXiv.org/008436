We report the first unambiguous quasi-periodic large-scale extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave or
shock that was detected by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory.
During the whip-like unwinding eruption of a small filament on 2012 April 24, multiple consecutive
large-scale wavefronts emanating from AR11467 were observed simultaneously along the solar surface
and a closed transequatorial loop system. In the meantime, an upward propagating dome-shaped wavefront
was also observed, whose initial speed and deceleration are about 1392 km/s and 1.78 km/s^2, respectively.
Along the solar surface, the quasi-peridoic wavefronts had a period of about 163 +/- 21 seconds and
propagated at a nearly constant speed of 747 +/- 26 km/s; they interacted with active region AR11469
and launched a sympathetic upward propagating secondary EUV wave. The wavefronts along the loop
system propagated at a speed of 897 km/s, and they were reflected back at the southern end of the loop
system at a similar speed. In addition to the propagating waves, a standing kink wave was also present
in the loop system simultaneously. Periodicity analysis reveals that the period of the wavefronts
was consistent with that of the unwinding helical structures of the erupting filament. Based on
these observational facts, we propose that the observed quasi-periodic EUV wavefronts were most
likely excited by the periodic unwinding motion of the filament helical structures. In addition,
two different seismological methods are applied to derive the magnetic field strength of the loop
system, and for the first time the reliability of these inversion techniques are tested with the
same magnetic structure.
