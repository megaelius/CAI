The precise determination of the physical and dynamical parameters of the HIP 109951 triple star
system (WDS J22161-0705AB) which is formed by the A, Ba, and Bb components are presented. The binary
nature of component B was recently confirmed by studying the radial velocities. The analysis of
the system follows Al-Wardat's complex method for analyzing CVBS which employs Kurucz (Atlas9)
line blanketed plane-parallel atmospheres simultaneously with an analytic method for dynamical
analysis (we used Docobo's method) to calculate the parameters of this triple system. The result
of our study yielded the following parameters: $T^{A}_{\rm eff}=5836\pm 80$ K, $R^{A}=1.090\pm0.039R_\odot$,
$\log$g$^{A}=4.45\pm0.06$, $\mathcal{M}^{A}=1.05\pm0.16\mathcal{M}_\odot$; $T^{Ba}_{\rm
eff}=5115\pm 80$ K, $R^{Ba}=0.596\pm0.05R_\odot$, $\log$ g$^{Ba}=4.60\pm0.07$, $\mathcal{M}^{Ba}=0.83\pm0.16\mathcal{M}_\odot$,
$T^{Bb}_{\rm eff}=4500\pm 80$ K, $R^{Bb}=0.490\pm0.06R_\odot$, $\log$ g$^{Bb}=4.65\pm0.07$,
and $\mathcal{M}^{Bb}=0.67\pm0.16\mathcal{M}_\odot$ based on the revised \textit{Hipparcos}
parallax. The orbital solution gave a total mass as $\mathcal{M}=2.59\mathcal{M}_\odot$ based
on Gaia parallax and $\mathcal{M}=2.15\mathcal{M}_\odot$ based on the revised \textit{Hipparcos}
parallax. The synthetic spectral energy distributions (SED) and synthetic stellar photometry
of the entire system and individual components are given and compared with the available observational
ones. Finally, the positions of the system components on the HR diagram and the evolutionary tracks
are given and their formation and the evolution of the system are discussed.
