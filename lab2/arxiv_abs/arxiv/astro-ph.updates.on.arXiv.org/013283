Stellar populations in barred galaxies save an imprint of the influence of the bar on the host galaxy's
evolution. We present a detailed analysis of star formation histories (SFHs) and chemical enrichment
of stellar populations in nine nearby barred galaxies from the TIMER project. We use integral field
observations with the MUSE instrument to derive unprecedented spatially resolved maps of stellar
ages, metallicities, [Mg/Fe] abundances and SFHs, as well as H$\alpha$ as a tracer of ongoing star
formation. We find a characteristic V-shaped signature in the SFH perpendicular to the bar major
axis which supports the scenario where intermediate age stars ($\sim 2$-$6\ \mathrm{Gyr}$) are
trapped on more elongated orbits shaping a thinner part of the bar, while older stars ($> 8\ \mathrm{Gyr}$)
are trapped on less elongated orbits shaping a rounder and thicker part of the bar. We compare our
data to state-of-the-art cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of barred galaxies
and show that such V-shaped SFHs arise naturally due to the dynamical influence of the bar on stellar
populations with different ages and kinematic properties. Additionally, we find an excess of very
young stars ($< 2\ \mathrm{Gyr}$) on the edges of the bars, predominantly on the leading side, confirming
typical star formation patterns in bars. Furthermore, mass-weighted age and metallicity gradients
are slightly shallower along the bar than in the disc likely due to orbital mixing in the bar. Finally,
we find that bars are mostly more metal-rich and less [Mg/Fe]-enhanced than the surrounding discs.
We interpret this as a signature that the bar quenches star formation in the inner region of discs,
usually referred to as star formation deserts. We discuss these results and their implications
on two different scenarios of bar formation and evolution.
