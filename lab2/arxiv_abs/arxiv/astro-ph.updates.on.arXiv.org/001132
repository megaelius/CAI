Context. The growth process of dust particles in protoplanetary disks can be modeled via numerical
dust coagulation codes. In this approach, physical effects that dominate the dust growth process
often must be implemented in a parameterized form. Due to a lack of these parameterizations, existing
studies of dust coagulation have ignored the effects a hydrodynamical gas flow can have on grain
growth, even though it is often argued that the flow could significantly contribute either positively
or negatively to the growth process. Aims. We intend to provide a quantification of hydrodynamical
effects on the growth of dust particles, such that these effects can be parameterized and implemented
in a dust coagulation code. Methods. We numerically integrate the trajectories of small dust particles
in the flow of disk gas around a proto-planetesimal, sampling a large parameter space in proto-planetesimal
radii, headwind velocities, and dust stopping times. Results. The gas flow deflects most particles
away from the proto-planetesimal, such that its effective collisional cross section, and therefore
the mass accretion rate, is reduced. The gas flow however also reduces the impact velocity of small
dust particles onto a proto-planetesimal. This can be beneficial for its growth, since large impact
velocities are known to lead to erosion. We also demonstrate why such a gas flow does not return collisional
debris to the surface of a proto-planetesimal. Conclusions. We predict that a laminar hydrodynamical
flow around a proto-planetesimal will have a significant effect on its growth. However, we cannot
easily predict which result, the reduction of the impact velocity or the sweep-up cross section,
will be more important. Therefore, we provide parameterizations ready for implementation into
a dust coagulation code.
