We present Atacama Large Millimeter Array CO(3$-$2) and HCO$^+$(4$-$3) observations covering
the central $1\rlap{.}'5$$\times$$1\rlap{.}'5$ region of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). The
unprecedented level of sensitivity ($\sim$0.1 mJy beam$^{-1}$) and angular resolution ($\sim$$0\rlap{.}''09
\approx 35$ AU) of these line observations enable us to search for gas-disk detections towards the
known positions of submillimeter-detected dust disks in this region. We detect 23 disks in gas:
17 in CO(3$-$2), 17 in HCO$^+$(4$-$3), and 11 in both lines. Depending on where the sources are located
in the ONC, we see the line detections in emission, in absorption against the warm background, or
in both emission and absorption. We spectrally resolve the gas with $0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ channels,
and find that the kinematics of most sources are consistent with Keplerian rotation. We measure
the distribution of gas-disk sizes and find typical radii of $\sim$50-200 AU. As such, gas disks
in the ONC are compact in comparison with the gas disks seen in low-density star-forming regions.
Gas sizes are universally larger than the dust sizes. However, the gas and dust sizes are not strongly
correlated. We find a positive correlation between gas size and distance from the massive star $\theta^1$
Ori C, indicating that disks in the ONC are influenced by photoionization. Finally, we use the observed
kinematics of the detected gas lines to model Keplerian rotation and infer the masses of the central
pre-main-sequence stars. Our dynamically-derived stellar masses are not consistent with the
spectroscopically-derived masses, and we discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy.
