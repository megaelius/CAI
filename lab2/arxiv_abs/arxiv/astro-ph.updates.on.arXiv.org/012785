We report on variability and correlation studies using multiwavelength observations of the blazar
Mrk 421 during the month of February, 2010 when an extraordinary flare reaching a level of $\sim$27~Crab
Units above 1~TeV was measured in very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-rays with the VERITAS observatory.
This is the highest flux state for Mrk 421 ever observed in VHE $\gamma$-rays. Data are analyzed from
a coordinated campaign across multiple instruments including VHE $\gamma$-ray (VERITAS, MAGIC),
high-energy (HE) $\gamma$-ray (Fermi-LAT), X-ray (Swift}, RXTE, MAXI), optical (including the
GASP-WEBT collaboration and polarization data) and radio (Mets\"ahovi, OVRO, UMRAO). Light curves
are produced spanning multiple days before and after the peak of the VHE flare, including over several
flare `decline' epochs. The main flare statistics allow 2-minute time bins to be constructed in
both the VHE and optical bands enabling a cross-correlation analysis that shows evidence for an
optical lag of $\sim$25-55 minutes, the first time-lagged correlation between these bands reported
on such short timescales. Limits on the Doppler factor ($\delta \gtrsim 33$) and the size of the emission
region ($ \delta^{-1}R_B \lesssim 3.8\times 10^{13}\,\,\mbox{cm}$) are obtained from the fast
variability observed by VERITAS during the main flare. Analysis of 10-minute-binned VHE and X-ray
data over the decline epochs shows an extraordinary range of behavior in the flux-flux relationship:
from linear to quadratic to lack of correlation to anti-correlation. Taken together, these detailed
observations of an unprecedented flare seen in Mrk 421 are difficult to explain by the classic single-zone
synchrotron self-Compton model.
