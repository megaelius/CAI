We present a new method to calculate formation of cosmological structure in the Newtonian limit.
The method is based on Lagrangian perturbation theory plus two key theoretical extensions. One
advance involves identifying and fixing a previously ignored gauge-like degree of freedom relating
quantities calculated in LPT to those measured by a preferred Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW)
observer. Handling this connection between calculational and observer frames is physically essential
and ensures a momentum conserving description. The second extension is to systematically re-expand
the equations of motion to increase LPT's radius of convergence to the maximum future time prior
to orbit crossing. The paper implements a complete algorithm and performs extensive "proof of principle"
tests of the new method, including direct comparison to known solutions, evaluation of conserved
quantities and formal convergence studies. All are satisfactory. We show convergence is exponential
in grid size and Lagrangian order and polynomial in step size. There are three {\it powerful advantages}
afforded by the new technique: (1) it employs a smooth representation of all fields and the results
are not limited by particle induced shot-noise errors, (2) it permits the numerical error to be controlled
by changing Lagrangian order and/or number of steps allowing, in principle, arbitrarily small
errors to be achieved prior to orbit crossing and (3) it handles generic cold initial data (any periodic
density and velocity fields, including those with initial rotational components). Together,
these properties make the new technique well-suited to handle quasi-linear scales where analytic
methods and/or numerical simulations fail to provide suitably accurate answers.
