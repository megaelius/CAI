In this paper, we present the stationary axisymmetric configuration of a resistive magnetised
thick accretion disc in the vicinity of external gravity and intrinsic dipolar magnetic field of
a slowly rotating black hole. The plasma is described by the equations of fully general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) along with the Ohm's law and in the absence of the effects of radiation
fields. We try to solve these two-dimensional MHD equations analytically as much as possible. However,
we sometimes inevitably refer to numerical methods as well. To fully understand the relativistic
geometrically thick accretion disc structure, we consider all three components of the fluid velocity
to be non-zero. This implies that the magnetofluid can flow in all three directions surrounding
the central black hole. As we get radially closer to the hole, the fluid flows faster in all those directions.
However, as we move towards the equator along the meridional direction, the radial inflow becomes
stronger from both the speed and the mass accretion rate points of view. Nonetheless, the vertical
(meridional) speed and the rotation of the plasma disc become slower in that direction. Due to the
presence of pressure gradient forces, a sub-Keplerian angular momentum distribution throughout
the thick disc is expected as well. To get a concise analytical form of the rate of accretion, we assume
that the radial dependency of radial and meridional fluid velocities is the same. This simplifying
assumption leads to radial independency of mass accretion rate. The motion of the accreting plasma
produces an azimuthal current whose strength is specified based on the strength of the external
dipolar magnetic field. This current generates a poloidal magnetic field in the disc which is continuous
across the disc boundary surface due to the presence of the finite resistivity for the plasma.
