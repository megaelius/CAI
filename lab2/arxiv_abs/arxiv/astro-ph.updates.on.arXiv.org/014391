Stellar systems are broadly divided into collisional and non-collisional. The latter are large-N
systems with long relaxation timescales and can be simulated disregarding two-body interactions,
while either computationally expensive direct N-body simulations or approximate schemes are
required to properly model the former. Large globular clusters and nuclear star clusters, with
relaxation timescales of the order of a Hubble time, are small enough to display some collisional
behaviour and big enough to be impossible to simulate with direct $N$-body codes and current hardware.
We introduce a new method to simulate collisional stellar systems, and validate it by comparison
with direct N-body codes on small-N simulations. The Multi-Particle collision for Dense stellar
systems Code (MPCDSS) is a new code for evolving stellar systems with the Multi-Particle Collision
method. Such method amounts to a stochastic collision rule that allows to conserve exactly the energy
and momentum over a cluster of particles experiencing the collision. The code complexity scales
with $N \log N$ in the number of particles. Unlike Monte-Carlo codes, MPCDSS can easily model asymmetric,
non-homogeneous, unrelaxed and rotating systems, while allowing us to follow the orbits of individual
stars. We evolve small ($N = 3.2 \times 10^4$) star clusters with MPCDSS and with the direct-summation
code NBODY6, finding a similar evolution of key indicators. We then simulate different initial
conditions in the $10^4 - 10^6$ star range. MPCDSS bridges the gap between small, collisional systems
that can be simulated with direct $N$-body codes and large noncollisional systems. MPCDSS in principle
allows us to simulate globular clusters such as Omega Cen and M54 and even the nuclear star cluster,
beyond the limits of current direct N-body codes in terms of the number of particles.
