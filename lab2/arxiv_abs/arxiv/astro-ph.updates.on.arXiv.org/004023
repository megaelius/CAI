Radio relics in galaxy clusters are believed to trace merger shock fronts. If cosmological structure
formation determines the luminosity, size and shape distributions of radio relics then merger
shocks need to be lighted up in a homogeneous way. We investigate if a mock relic sample, obtained
from zoomed galaxy cluster simulations, is able to match the properties of relics measured in the
NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS). We compile a list of all radio relics known to date and homogeneously measure
their parameters in all NVSS images and apply the same procedure to relics in our simulations. Number
counts in the mock relic sample increase more steeply towards lower relic flux densities, suggesting
an incompleteness of NVSS in this regime. Overall, we find that NVSS and mock samples show similar
properties. However, large simulated relics tend to be somewhat smaller and closer to the cluster
centre than observed ones. Besides this, the mock sample reproduces very well-known correlations
for radio relics, in particular those relating the radio luminosity with the largest linear size
and the X-ray luminosity. We show that these correlations are largely governed by the sensitivity
of the NVSS observations. Mock relics show a similar orientation with respect to the direction to
the cluster centre as the NVSS sample. Moreover, we find that their maximum radio luminosity roughly
correlates with cluster mass, although displaying a large scatter. The overall good agreement
between NVSS and the mock sample suggests that properties of radio relics are indeed governed by
merger shock fronts, emitting in a homogeneous fashion. Our study demonstrates that the combination
of mock observations and data from upcoming radio surveys will allow to shed light on both the origin
of radio relics and the nature of the intracluster medium.
