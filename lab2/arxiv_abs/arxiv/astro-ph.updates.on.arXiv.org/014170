Theoretical models of the ionization state in protoplanetary disks suggest the existence of large
areas with low ionization and weak coupling between the gas and magnetic fields. In this regime hydrodynamical
instabilities may become important. In this work we investigate the gas and dust structure and dynamics
for a typical T Tauri system under the influence of the vertical shear instability (VSI). We use global
3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations covering all $360^\circ$ of azimuth with embedded particles
of 0.1 and 1mm size, evolved for 400 orbits. Stellar irradiation heating is included with opacities
for 0.1- to 10-$\mu$m-sized dust. Saturated VSI turbulence produces a stress-to-pressure ratio
of $\alpha \simeq 10^{-4}$. The value of $\alpha$ is lowest within 30~au of the star, where thermal
relaxation is slower relative to the orbital period and approaches the rate below which VSI is cut
off. The rise in $\alpha$ from 20 to 30~au causes a dip in the surface density near 35~au, leading to
Rossby wave instability and the generation of a stationary, long-lived vortex spanning about 4~au
in radius and 40~au in azimuth. Our results confirm previous findings that mm size grains are strongly
vertically mixed by the VSI. The scale height aspect ratio for 1mm grains is determined to be 0.037,
much higher than the value $H/r=0.007$ obtained from millimeter-wave observations of the HL~Tau
system. The measured aspect ratio is better fit by non-ideal MHD models. In our VSI turbulence model,
the mm grains drift radially inwards and many are trapped and concentrated inside the vortex. The
turbulence induces a velocity dispersion of $\sim 12$~m/s for the mm grains, indicating that grain-grain
collisions could lead to fragmentation.
