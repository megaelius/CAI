This first paper in a series describes the design of a study testing whether pre-appearance signatures
of solar magnetic active regions were detectable using various tools of local helioseismology.
The ultimate goal is to understand flux-emergence mechanisms by setting observational constraints
on pre-appearance subsurface changes, for comparison with results from simulation efforts. This
first paper provides details of the data selection and preparation of the samples, each containing
over 100 members, of two populations: regions on the Sun that produced a numbered NOAA active region,
and a "control" sample of areas that did not. The seismology is performed on data from the GONG network;
accompanying magnetic data from SOHO/MDI are used for co-temporal analysis of the surface magnetic
field. Samples are drawn from 2001 -- 2007, and each target is analyzed for 27.7 hr prior to an objectively
determined time of emergence. The results of two analysis approaches are published separately:
one based on averages of the seismology- and magnetic-derived signals over the samples, another
based on Discriminant Analysis of these signals, for a statistical test of detectable differences
between the two populations. We include here descriptions of a new potential-field calculation
approach and the algorithm for matching sample distributions over multiple variables. We describe
known sources of bias and the approaches used to mitigate them. We also describe unexpected bias
sources uncovered during the course of the study and include a discussion of refinements that should
be included in future work on this topic.
