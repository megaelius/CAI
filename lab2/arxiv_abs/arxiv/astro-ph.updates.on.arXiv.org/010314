The bulge represents the best compromise between old and massive Galactic component, and as such
its study is a valuable opportunity to understand how the bulk of the Milky Way formed and evolved.
In addition, being the only bulge in which we can individually resolve stars in all evolutionary
sequences, the properties of its stellar content provide crucial insights on the formation of bulges
at large. We aim at providing a detailed and comprehensive census of the Milky Way bulge stellar populations
by producing deep and accurate photometric catalogs of the inner ~300 sqdeg of the Galaxy. We perform
DAOPHOT/ALLFRAME PSF-fitting photometry of multi-epochs J and Ks images provided by the VVV survey
to obtain deep photometric catalogs. Artificial star experiments have been conducted on all images
to properly assess the completeness and the accuracy of the photometric measurements. We present
a photometric database containing nearly 600 million stars across the bulge area surveyed by the
VVV. Through the comparison of derived color-magnitude diagrams of selected fields representative
of different levels of extinction and crowding, we show the quality, completeness and depth of the
new catalogs. With the exception of the fields located along the plane, this new photometry samples
stars down to ~1-2 mag below the MS-TO with unprecedented accuracy. To demonstrate the tremendous
potential inherent to this new dataset, we give few examples of possible applications such as: i)
star counts studies through the dataset completeness map; ii) surface brightness map; and iii)
cross-correlation with Gaia DR2. The database presented here represents an invaluable collection
for the whole community, and we encourage its exploitation. The photometric catalogs including
completeness information are publicly available through the ESO Science Archive.
