Early-type galaxies (ETGs) are observed to be more compact, on average, at $z \gtrsim 2$ than at $z\simeq
0$, at fixed stellar mass. Recent observational works suggest that such size evolution could reflect
the similar evolution of the host dark matter halo density as a function of the time of galaxy quenching.
We explore this hypothesis by studying the distribution of halo central velocity dispersion ($\sigma_0$)
and half-mass radius ($r_{\rm h}$) as functions of halo mass $M$ and redshift $z$, in a cosmological
$\Lambda$-CDM $N$-body simulation. In the range $0\lesssim z\lesssim 2.5$, we find $\sigma_0\propto
M^{0.31-0.37}$ and $r_{\rm h}\propto M^{0.28-0.32}$, close to the values expected for homologous
virialized systems. At fixed $M$ in the range $10^{11} M_\odot \lesssim M\lesssim 5.5 \times 10^{14}
M_\odot$ we find $\sigma_0\propto(1+z)^{0.35}$ and $r_{\rm h}\propto(1+z)^{-0.7}$. We show
that such evolution of the halo scaling laws is driven by individual haloes growing in mass following
the evolutionary tracks $\sigma_0\propto M^{0.2}$ and $r_{\rm h}\propto M^{0.6}$, consistent
with simple dissipationless merging models in which the encounter orbital energy is accounted
for. We compare the $N$-body data with ETGs observed at $0\lesssim z\lesssim3$ by populating the
haloes with a stellar component under simple but justified assumptions: the resulting galaxies
evolve consistently with the observed ETGs up to $z \simeq 2$, but the model has difficulty reproducing
the fast evolution observed at $z\gtrsim 2$. We conclude that a substantial fraction of the size
evolution of ETGs can be ascribed to a systematic dependence on redshift of the dark matter haloes
structural properties.
