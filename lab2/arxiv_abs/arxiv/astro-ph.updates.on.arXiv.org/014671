We generalise Einstein's formulation of the traceless Einstein equations to $f(R)$ gravity theories.
In the case of the vacuum traceless Einstein equations, we show that a non-constant Weyl tensor leads
via a conformal transformation to a dimensionally homogeneous (`no-scale') theory in the conformal
frame with a scalar field source that has an exponential potential. We then formulate the traceless
version of $f(R)$ gravity, and we find that a conformal transformation leads to a no-scale theory
conformally equivalent to general relativity and a scalar field $\phi $ with a potential given by
the scale-invariant form: $V(\phi )=\frac{D-2}{4D}Re^{-\phi }$, where $\phi =[2/(D-2)]\ln
f^{\prime }(R)$. In this theory, the cosmological constant is a mere integration constant, statistically
distributed in a multiverse of independent causal domains, the vacuum energy is another unrelated
arbitrary constant, and the same is true of the height of the inflationary plateau present in a huge
variety of potentials. Unlike in the conformal equivalent of full general relativity, flat potentials
are found to be possible in all spacetime dimensions for polynomial lagrangians of all orders. Hence,
we are led to a novel interpretation of the cosmological constant vacuum energy problem and have
accelerated inflationary expansion in the very early universe with a very small cosmological constant
at late times for a wide range of no-scale theories. Fine-tunings required in traceless general
relativity or standard non-traceless $f(R)$ theories of gravity are avoided. We show that the predictions
of the scale-invariant conformal potential are completely consistent with microwave background
observational data concerning the primordial tilt and the tensor-to-scalar ratio.
