Hierarchical mergers are one of the distinctive signatures of binary black hole (BBH) formation
through dynamical evolution. Here, we present a fast Monte Carlo approach to simulate hierarchical
mergers in nuclear star clusters (NSCs), globular clusters (GCs) and young star clusters (YSCs).
Hierarchical mergers are orders of magnitude more common in NSCs than they are in both GCs and YSCs,
because of the different escape velocity. In our fiducial model, the fraction of hierarchical mergers
over all mergers is $\sim{}0.15$, $\sim{}6\times{}10^{-3}$ and $\sim{}10^{-4}$ in NSCs, GCs
and YSCs, respectively. The mass distribution of hierarchical BBHs strongly depends on the properties
of first-generation BBHs, such as their progenitor's metallicity. In our fiducial model, we form
black holes (BHs) with masses up to $\sim{}10^3$ M$_\odot$ in NSCs and up to $\sim{}10^2$ M$_\odot$
in both GCs and YSCs. When escape velocities in excess of 100 km s$^{-1}$ are considered, BHs with
mass $>10^3$ M$_\odot$ are allowed to form in NSCs. Hierarchical mergers lead to the formation of
BHs in the pair instability mass gap and intermediate-mass BHs (IMBHs), but only in metal-poor environments.
In our fiducial model, at metallicity $Z\sim{}0.0002$, the fraction of BBH mergers with primary
BH in the pair instability mass gap is $\sim{}7\times{}10^{-3}$, $3\times{}10^{-4}$ and $5\times{}10^{-6}$
in NSCs, GCs and YSCs, respectively. In metal-poor NSCs, the fraction of BBH mergers with primary
mass in the IMBH regime is $\sim{}5\times{}10^{-4}$. The local BBH merger rate in our models ranges
from $\sim{}10$ to $\sim{} 60$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$; hierarchical BBHs in NSCs account for $\sim{}10^{-2}-
0.2$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, with a strong upper limit of $\sim{}10$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$.
