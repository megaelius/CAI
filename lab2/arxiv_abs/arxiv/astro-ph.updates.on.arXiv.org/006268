Quiescent galaxies at $z \gtrsim 2$ are compact and have weak or absent emission lines, making it
difficult to spatially resolve their kinematics and stellar populations using ground-based spectroscopy.
Gravitationally lensed examples provide a promising route forward, but such objects are very rare.
We describe a search in the fields of 232 galaxy clusters that has uncovered five bright ($H_{\rm
AB} < 20$) lensed galaxies with red near-infrared colors. These include MRG-M0138, the brightest
lensed galaxy known in the near-infrared. Analysis of near-infrared spectra and multiband photometry
confirms that all are quiescent galaxies at z=1.95-2.64 with stellar ages of 0.5-1.4 Gyr (corresponding
to formation epochs $z_{\rm form} \simeq 3-4$) and stellar masses of $10^{11.6-12.8} \mu^{-1}
M_{\odot}$, where $\mu$ is the magnification. In three cases we derive lens models and reconstruct
the source structure; these galaxies are massive ($M_* \gtrsim 10^{11.0} M_{\odot}$) and follow
the mass--size relation defined by unlensed samples. In two of these three galaxies, the main structural
component is an inclined disk. Weak emission lines are detected in four of five galaxies with high
ratios [NII]/H$\alpha$~2-6 that are inconsistent with a star formation origin. Based on the line
ratios, the H$\alpha$ equivalent widths, and the distribution and kinematics of the gas, we infer
that shocks are likely present in at least two galaxies and could be present in all of the line emitters.
We speculate that these could be analogs of local galaxies in which AGN jet-driven outflows are thought
to heat the interstellar medium and suppress star formation. In further papers we will present spatially
resolved measurements of the stellar populations and kinematics of this unique sample.
