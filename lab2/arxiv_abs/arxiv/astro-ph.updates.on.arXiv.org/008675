Context: The study of stellar structure and evolution depends crucially on accurate stellar parameters.
The photometry from space telescopes has provided superb data that allowed asteroseismic characterisation
of thousands of stars. However, typical targets of space telescopes are rather faint and complementary
measurements are difficult to obtain. On the other hand, the brightest, otherwise well-studied
stars, are lacking seismic characterization. Aims: Our goal is to use the granulation and/or oscillation
time scales measured from photometric time series of bright red giants (1.6$\leq$Vmag$\leq$5.3)
observed with BRITE to determine stellar surface gravities and masses. Methods: We use probabilistic
methods to characterize the granulation and/or oscillation signal in the power density spectra
and the autocorrelation function of the BRITE time series. Results: We detect a clear granulation
and/or oscillation signal in 23 red giant stars and extract the corresponding time scales from the
power density spectra as well as the autocorrelation function of the BRITE time series. To account
for the recently discovered non-linearity of the classical seismic scaling relations, we use parameters
from a large sample of Kepler stars to re-calibrate the scalings of the high- and low-frequency components
of the granulation signal. We develop a method to identify which component is measured if only one
granulation component is statistically significant in the data. We then use the new scalings to
determine the surface gravity of our sample stars, finding them to be consistent with those determined
from the autocorrelation signal of the time series. We further use radius estimates from the literature
to determine the stellar masses of our sample stars from the measured surface gravities. We also
define a statistical measure for the evolutionary stage of the stars.
