We establish a robust statistical description of the star-forming galaxy population at the end
of cosmic HI reionization ($5.0\le{}z\le6.6$) from a large sample of 52 galaxies with spectroscopically
confirmed redshifts from the VIMOS UltraDeep Survey. We identify galaxies with Ly$\alpha$ either
in absorption or in emission, at variance with most spectroscopic samples in the literature where
Ly$\alpha$ emitters dominate. We find that star-forming galaxies at these redshifts are distributed
along a main sequence in the stellar mass vs. SFR plane. We report a flat evolution of the sSFR(z) in
3<z<6 compared to lower redshift measurements. UV-continuum slopes vary with luminosity, with
a large dispersion. We determing UV and Ly$\alpha$ luminosity functions using V$_{max}$ method
and use them to derive star formation rate densities (SFRD). We find that both UV-derived and Ly$\alpha$-derived
SFRDs are in excellent agreement after correcting Ly$\alpha$ luminosity density for IGM absorption.
Our new SFRD measurements at a mean redshift z=5.6 confirm the steep decline of the SFRD at z>2. The
bright end of the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity function has a high number density, indicating a significant
star formation activity concentrated in the brightest Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAE) at these redshifts.
LAE with EW>25\AA ~contribute to about 75\% of the total UV-derived SFRD. While our analysis favors
a low dust content in 5.0<z<6.6, uncertainties on the dust extinction correction and associated
degeneracies in spectral fitting will remain an issue to estimate the total SFRD until future survey
extending spectroscopy to the NIR rest-frame spectral domain, e.g. with JWST.
