The applicability of a linearized perturbed FLRW metric to the late, lumpy universe has been subject
to debate. We consider in an elementary way the Newtonian limit of the Einstein equations with this
ansatz for the case of structure formation in late-time cosmology, on small and large scales, and
argue that linearizing the Einstein tensor produces only a small error down to arbitrarily small,
decoupled scales (e.g. Solar system scales). On subhorizon patches, the metric scale factor becomes
a coordinate choice equivalent to choosing the spatial curvature, and not a sign that the FLRW metric
cannot perturbatively accommodate very different local physical expansion rates of matter; we
distinguish these concepts, and show that they merge on large scales for the Newtonian limit to be
globally valid. Furthermore, on subhorizon scales, a perturbed FLRW metric ansatz does not already
imply assumptions on isotropy, and effects beyond an FLRW background, including those potentially
caused by non-linearities of general relativity (GR), may be encoded into non-trivial boundary
conditions. The corresponding cosmologies have already been developed in a Newtonian setting
by Heckmann and Sch\"ucking and none of these boundary conditions can explain the accelerated expansion
of the universe. Our analysis of the field equations is confirmed on the level of solutions by an example
of pedagogical value, comparing a collapsing top-hat overdensity (embedded into a cosmological
background) treated in such perturbative manner to the corresponding exact solution of GR, where
we find good agreement even in the regimes of strong density contrast.
