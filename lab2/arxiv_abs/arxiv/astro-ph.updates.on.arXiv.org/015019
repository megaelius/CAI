Galactic outflows driven by stellar feedback are crucial for explaining the inefficiency of star
formation in galaxies. Although strong feedback can promote the formation of galactic discs by
limiting star formation at early times and removing low angular momentum gas, it is not understood
how the same feedback can result in diverse objects such as elliptical galaxies or razor thin spiral
galaxies. We investigate this problem using cosmological zoom-in simulations of two galaxies
forming within $10^{12}~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ halos with almost identical mass accretion histories
and halo spin parameters. However, the two resulting galaxies end up with very different bulge-to-disc
ratios at $z = 0$. At $z>1.5$, the two galaxies feature a surface density of star formation $\Sigma_{\rm
SFR}\simeq 10~\mathrm{M_\odot}~{\rm yr}^{-1}~{\rm kpc}^{-2}$, leading to strong outflows.
After the last starburst episode, both galaxies feature a dramatic gaseous disc growth from 1~kpc
to 5~kpc during 1~Gyr, a decisive event we dub "the Grand Twirl". After this event, the evolutionary
tracks diverge strongly, with one galaxy ending up as a bulge-dominated galaxy, whereas the other
ends up as a disc-dominated galaxy. The origins of this dichotomy are the angular momentum of the
accreted gas, and whether it adds constructively to the initial disc angular momentum. The build-up
of this extended disc leads to a rapid lowering of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ by over two orders of magnitude
with $\Sigma_{\rm SFR} \lesssim 0.1~\mathrm{M_\odot}~{\rm yr}^{-1}~{\rm kpc}^{-2}$, in remarkable
agreement with what is derived from Milky Way stellar populations. As a consequence, supernovae
explosions are spread out and cannot launch galactic outflows anymore, allowing for the persistence
of a thin, gently star forming, extended disc.
