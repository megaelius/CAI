Long and consistent sunspot area records are important for understanding the long-term solar activity
and variability. Multiple observatories around the globe have regularly recorded sunspot areas,
but such individual records only cover restricted periods of time. Furthermore, there are also
systematic differences between them, so that these records need to be cross-calibrated before
they can be reliably used for further studies. We produce a cross-calibrated and homogeneous record
of total daily sunspot areas, both projected and corrected, covering the period between 1874 and
2019. A catalogue of calibrated individual group areas is also generated for the same period. We
have compared the data from nine archives: Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO), Kislovodsk, Pulkovo,
Debrecen, Kodaikanal, Solar Optical Observing Network (SOON), Rome, Catania, and Yunnan Observatories,
covering the period between 1874 and 2019. Mutual comparisons of the individual records have been
employed to produce homogeneous and inter-calibrated records of daily projected and corrected
areas. As in earlier studies, the basis of the composite is formed by the data from RGO. After 1976,
the only datasets used are those from Kislovodsk, Pulkovo and Debrecen observatories. This choice
was made based on the temporal coverage and the quality of the data. In contrast to the SOON data used
in previous area composites for the post-RGO period, the properties of the data from Kislovodsk
and Pulkovo are very similar to those from the RGO series. They also directly overlap the RGO data
in time, which makes their cross-calibration with RGO much more reliable. We have also computed
and provide the daily Photometric Sunspot Index (PSI) widely used, e.g., in empirical reconstructions
of solar irradiance.
