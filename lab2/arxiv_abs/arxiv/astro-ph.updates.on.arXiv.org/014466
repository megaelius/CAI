The H0LiCOW collaboration inferred via gravitational lensing time delays a Hubble constant $H_0=73.3^{+1.7}_{-1.8}$
km s$^{-1}{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, describing deflector mass density profiles by either a power-law or
stars plus standard dark matter halos. The mass-sheet transform (MST) that leaves the lensing observables
unchanged is considered the dominant source of residual uncertainty in $H_0$. We quantify any potential
effect of the MST with flexible mass models that are maximally degenerate with H0. Our calculation
is based on a new hierarchical approach in which the MST is only constrained by stellar kinematics.
The approach is validated on hydrodynamically simulated lenses. We apply the method to the TDCOSMO
sample of 7 lenses (6 from H0LiCOW) and measure $H_0=74.5^{+5.6}_{-6.1}$ km s$^{-1}{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$.
In order to further constrain the deflector mass profiles, we then add imaging and spectroscopy
for 33 strong gravitational lenses from the SLACS sample. For 9 of the SLAC lenses we use resolved
kinematics to constrain the stellar anisotropy. From the joint analysis of the TDCOSMO+SLACS sample,
we measure $H_0=67.4^{+4.1}_{-3.2}$ km s$^{-1}{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, assuming that the TDCOSMO and
SLACS galaxies are drawn from the same parent population. The blind H0LiCOW, TDCOSMO-only and TDCOSMO+SLACS
analyses are in mutual statistical agreement. The TDCOSMO+SLACS analysis prefers marginally
shallower mass profiles than H0LiCOW or TDCOSMO-only. While our new analysis does not statistically
invalidate the mass profile assumptions by H0LiCOW, and thus their $H_0$ measurement relying on
those, it demonstrates the importance of understanding the mass density profile of elliptical
galaxies. The uncertainties on $H_0$ derived in this paper can be reduced by physical or observational
priors on the form of the mass profile, or by additional data, chiefly spatially resolved kinematics
of lens galaxies.
