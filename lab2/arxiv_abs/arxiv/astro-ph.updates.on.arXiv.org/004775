We use the IllustrisTNG (TNG) cosmological simulations to provide theoretical expectations for
the DM mass fractions (DMFs) and circular velocity profiles within the inner regions of haloes where
galaxies reside. TNG predicts flat circular velocity curves for $z=0$ MW-like haloes beyond a few
kpc from the galaxy centre, in better agreement with observational constraints than its predecessor,
Illustris. TNG also predicts an enhancement of the DM mass within the 3D stellar half-mass radius
($r_{\rm half}$) of galaxies ($M_{200c}=10^{10}-10^{13}M_{\odot}$, $z\le 2$) in comparison
to their DM-only and Illustris counterparts. This enhancement leads TNG present-day galaxies
to be dominated by DM within their inner regions, with $f_{\rm DM} (< r_{\rm half}) \gtrsim 0.5$ at
all masses and with a minimum for MW-mass haloes. The DMFs in $z=0$ TNG ellipticals are in broad agreement
with the median, but not the scatter of e.g. the observed {\sc sluggs} galaxies, with $f_{\rm DM}(<
2-5 \times r_{\rm half})\sim 0.5-0.9$ in $M_{\rm stars}\gtrsim 10^{10}M_{\odot}$ galaxies.
The DMFs measured within $r_{\rm half}$ decline towards higher redshifts, such evolution being
dominated by the increase in galaxy size with time. At $z\sim2$, the DMF in disc-like TNG galaxies
decreases with increasing galaxy mass, with $f_{\rm DM}(< r_{\rm half}) \sim 0.10-0.65$ for $10^{10}
\lesssim M_{\rm stars}/M_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{12}$, and are two times higher than if TNG galaxies
resided in NFW DM haloes unaffected by baryonic physics. It remains to be properly assessed whether
recent observational estimates of the DMFs at $z\le2$ rule out the contraction of the DM haloes predicted
by the TNG model.
