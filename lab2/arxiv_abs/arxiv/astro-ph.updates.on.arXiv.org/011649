On 15 February 2013, the asteroid 367943 Duende (2012 DA14) experienced a near-Earth encounter
at an altitude of 27,700 km or 4.2 Earth radii. We present here the results of an extensive, multi-observatory
campaign designed to probe for spectral and/or rotational changes to Duende due to gravitational
interactions with the Earth during the flyby. Our spectral data reveal no changes within the systematic
uncertainties of the data. Post-flyby lightcurve photometry places strong constraints on the
rotation state of Duende, showing that it is in non-principal axis rotation with fundamental periods
of P_1 = 8.71 +/- 0.03 and P_2 = 23.7 +/- 0.2 hours. Multiple lightcurve analysis techniques, coupled
with theoretical considerations and delay-doppler radar imaging, allows us to assign these periods
to specific rotational axes of the body. In particular we suggest that Duende is now in a non-principal,
short axis mode rotation state with a precessional period equal to P_1 and oscillation about the
symmetry axis at a rate equal to P_2. Temporal and signal-to-noise limitations inherent to the pre-flyby
photometric dataset make it difficult to definitively diagnose whether these periods represent
a change imparted due to gravitational torques during the flyby. However, based on multiple analysis
techniques and a number of plausibility arguments, we suggest that Duende experienced a rotational
change during the planetary encounter with an increase in its precessional rotation period. Our
preferred interpretation of the available data is that the precession rate increased from 8.4 hours
prior to the flyby to 8.7 hours afterwards. A companion paper by Benson et al. (2019) provides a more
detailed dynamical analysis of this event and compares the data to synthetic lightcurves computed
from a simple shape model of Duende. (abbreviated abstract)
