Direct detection of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) via the red-shifted 21-cm line will have unprecedented
implications on the study of structure formation in the infant Universe. To fulfill this promise,
current and future 21-cm experiments need to detect this weak EoR signal in the presence of foregrounds
that are several orders of magnitude larger. This requires extreme noise control and improved wide-field
high dynamic-range imaging techniques. We propose a new imaging method based on a maximum likelihood
framework which solves for the interferometric equation directly on the sphere, or equivalently
in the $uvw$-domain. The method uses the one-to-one relation between spherical waves and spherical
harmonics (SpH). It consistently handles signals from the entire sky, and does not require a $w$-term
correction. The spherical-harmonics coefficients represent the sky-brightness distribution
and the visibilities in the $uvw$-domain, and provide a direct estimate of the spatial power spectrum.
Using these spectrally-smooth SpH coefficients, bright foregrounds can be removed from the signal,
including their side-lobe noise, which is one of the limiting factors in high dynamics range wide-field
imaging. Chromatic effects causing the so-called "wedge" are effectively eliminated (i.e. deconvolved)
in the cylindrical ($k_{\perp}, k_{\parallel}$) power spectrum, compared to a power spectrum
computed directly from the images of the foreground visibilities where the wedge is clearly present.
We illustrate our method using simulated LOFAR observations, finding an excellent reconstruction
of the input EoR signal with minimal bias.
