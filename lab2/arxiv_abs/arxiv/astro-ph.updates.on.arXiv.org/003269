Determining the redshift distribution $n(z)$ of galaxy samples is essential for several cosmological
probes including weak lensing. For imaging surveys, this is usually done using photometric redshifts
estimated on an object-by-object basis. We present a new approach for directly measuring the global
$n(z)$ of cosmological galaxy samples, including uncertainties, using forward modeling. Our
method relies on image simulations produced using UFig (Ultra Fast Image Generator) and on ABC (Approximate
Bayesian Computation) within the $MCCL$ (Monte-Carlo Control Loops) framework. The galaxy population
is modeled using parametric forms for the luminosity functions, spectral energy distributions,
sizes and radial profiles of both blue and red galaxies. We apply exactly the same analysis to the
real data and to the simulated images, which also include instrumental and observational effects.
By adjusting the parameters of the simulations, we derive a set of acceptable models that are statistically
consistent with the data. We then apply the same cuts to the simulations that were used to construct
the target galaxy sample in the real data. The redshifts of the galaxies in the resulting simulated
samples yield a set of $n(z)$ distributions for the acceptable models. We demonstrate the method
by determining $n(z)$ for a cosmic shear like galaxy sample from the 4-band Subaru Suprime-Cam data
in the COSMOS field. We also complement this imaging data with a spectroscopic calibration sample
from the VVDS survey. We compare our resulting posterior $n(z)$ distributions to the one derived
from photometric redshifts estimated using 36 photometric bands in COSMOS and find good agreement.
This offers good prospects for applying our approach to current and future large imaging surveys.
