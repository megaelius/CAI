Probing the connection between a star's metallicity and the presence and properties of any associated
planets offers an observational link between conditions during the epoch of planet formation and
mature planetary systems. We explore this connection by analyzing the metallicities of Kepler
target stars and the subset of stars found to host transiting planets. After correcting for survey
incompleteness, we measure planet occurrence: the number of planets per 100 stars with a given metallicity
$M$. Planet occurrence correlates with metallicity for some, but not all, planet sizes and orbital
periods. For warm super-Earths having $P = 10-100$ days and $R_P = 1.0-1.7~R_E$, planet occurrence
is nearly constant over metallicities spanning $-$0.4 dex to +0.4 dex. We find 20 warm super-Earths
per 100 stars, regardless of metallicity. In contrast, the occurrence of warm sub-Neptunes ($R_P
= 1.7-4.0~R_E$) doubles over that same metallicity interval, from 20 to 40 planets per 100 stars.
We model the distribution of planets as $d f \propto 10^{\beta M} d M$, where $\beta$ characterizes
the strength of any metallicity correlation. This correlation steepens with decreasing orbital
period and increasing planet size. For warm super-Earths $\beta = -0.3^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$, while
for hot Jupiters $\beta = +3.4^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$. High metallicities in protoplanetary disks may
increase the mass of the largest rocky cores or the speed at which they are assembled, enhancing the
production of planets larger than 1.7 $R_E$. The association between high metallicity and short-period
planets may reflect disk density profiles that facilitate the inward migration of solids or higher
rates of planet-planet scattering.
