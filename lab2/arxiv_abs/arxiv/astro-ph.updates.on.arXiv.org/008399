We present a catalog of stellar age and mass estimates for a sample of 640\,986 red giant branch (RGB)
stars of the Galactic disk from the LAMOST Galactic Spectroscopic Survey (DR4). The RGB stars are
distinguished from the red clump stars utilizing period spacing derived from the spectra with a
machine learning method based on kernel principal component analysis (KPCA). Cross-validation
suggests our method is capable of distinguishing RC from RGB stars with only 2 per cent contamination
rate for stars with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) higher than 50. The age and mass of these RGB stars
are determined from their LAMOST spectra with KPCA method by taking the LAMOST - $Kepler$ giant stars
having asteroseismic parameters and the LAMOST-TGAS sub-giant stars based on isochrones as training
sets. Examinations suggest that the age and mass estimates of our RGB sample stars with SNR $>$ 30
have a median error of 30 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively. Stellar ages are found to exhibit
positive vertical and negative radial gradients across the disk, and the age structure of the disk
is strongly flared across the whole disk of $6<R<13$\,kpc. The data set demonstrates good correlations
among stellar age, [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe]. There are two separate sequences in the [Fe/H] -- [$\alpha$/Fe]
plane: a high--$\alpha$ sequence with stars older than $\sim$\,8\,Gyr and a low--$\alpha$ sequence
composed of stars with ages covering the whole range of possible ages of stars. We also examine relations
between age and kinematic parameters derived from the Gaia DR2 parallax and proper motions. Both
the median value and dispersion of the orbital eccentricity are found to increase with age. The vertical
angular momentum is found to fairly smoothly decrease with age from 2 to 12\,Gyr, with a rate of about
$-$50\,kpc\,km\,s$^{-1}$\,Gyr$^{-1}$. A full table of the catalog is public available online.
