Very-high-energy (VHE; $\geq 10$ GeV) photons are expected from the nearest and brightest Gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs). VHE photons, at energies higher than 300 GeV, were recently reported by the MAGIC
collaboration for this burst. Immediately, GRB 190114C was followed up by a massive observational
campaign covering a large fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum. In this paper, we obtain the
LAT light curve of GRB 190114C and show that it exhibits similar features to other bright LAT-detected
bursts; the first high-energy photon ($\geq$ 100 MeV) is delayed with the onset of the prompt phase
and the flux light curve exhibits a long-lived emission (lasting much longer than the prompt phase)
and a short-lasting bright peak (located at the beginning of long-lived emission). Analyzing the
multi-wavelength observations, we show that the short-lasting LAT and GBM bright peaks are consistent
with the synchrotron self-Compton reverse-shock model and the long-lived observations with the
standard synchrotron forward-shock model that evolves from a stratified stellar-wind like medium
to a uniform ISM-like medium. Given the best-fit values, a bright optical flash produced by synchrotron
reverse-shock emission is expected. From our analysis we infer that the high-energy photons are
produced in the deceleration phase of the outflow and some additional processes to synchrotron
in the forward shocks should be considered to properly describe the LAT photons with energies beyond
the synchrotron limit. Moreover, we claim that an outflow endowed with magnetic fields could describe
the polarization and properties exhibited in the light curve of GRB 190114C.
