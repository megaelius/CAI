The overwhelming foreground causes severe contamination on the detection of 21-cm signal during
the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Among various foreground components, the Galactic free-free
emission is less studied, so that its impact on the EoR observation remains unclear. To better constrain
this emission, we perform the Monte Carlo simulation of H$\alpha$ emission, which comprises direct
and scattered H$\alpha$ radiation from HII regions and warm ionized medium (WIM). The positions
and radii of HII regions are quoted from the WISE HII catalog, and the WIM is described by an axisymmetric
model. The scattering is off dust and free electrons that are realized by applying an exponential
fitting to the HI4PI HI map and an exponential disk model, respectively. The simulated H$\alpha$
intensity, the Simfast21 software, and the latest SKA1-Low layout configuration are employed
to simulate the SKA "observed" images of Galactic free-free emission and the EoR signal. By analyzing
the one-dimensional power spectra, we find that the Galactic free-free emission can be about $10^{5.4}$-$10^{2.1}$,
$10^{5.0}$-$10^{1.7}$, and $10^{4.3}$-$10^{1.1}$ times more luminous than the EoR signal on
scales of $0.1~{\rm Mpc^{-1}} < k < 2~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ in the 116-124, 146-154, and 186-194 MHz frequency
bands, respectively. We further calculate the two-dimensional power spectra inside the EoR window
and show that the power leaked by Galactic free-free emission can still be significant, as the power
ratios can reach about $110\%$-$8000\%$, $30\%$-$2400\%$, and $10\%$-$250\%$ on scales of $0.5~{\rm
Mpc^{-1}} \lesssim k \lesssim 1~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ in three frequency bands. Therefore, we indicate
that the Galactic free-free emission should be carefully treated in future EoR detections.
