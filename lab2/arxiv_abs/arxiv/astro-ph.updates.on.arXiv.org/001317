HCl and HF are expected to be the main reservoirs of fluorine and chlorine wherever hydrogen is predominantly
molecular. They are found to be strongly depleted in dense molecular clouds, suggesting freeze-out
onto grains in such cold environments. We can then expect that HCl and HF were also the major carriers
of Cl and F in the gas and icy phases of the outer solar nebula, and were incorporated into comets. We
aimed to measure the HCl and HF abundances in cometary ices as they can provide insights on the halogen
chemistry in the early solar nebula. We searched for the J(1-0) lines of HCl and HF at 626 and 1232 GHz,
respectively, using the HIFI instrument on board the Herschel Space Observatory. HCl was searched
for in comets 103P/Hartley 2 and C/2009 P1 (Garradd), whereas observations of HF were conducted
in comet C/2009 P1. In addition, observations of H$_2$O and H$_2^{18}$O lines were performed in
C/2009 P1 to measure the H$_2$O production rate. Three lines of CH$_3$OH were serendipitously observed
in the HCl receiver setting. HCl is not detected, whereas a marginal (3.6-$\sigma$) detection of
HF is obtained. The upper limits for the HCl abundance relative to water are 0.011% and 0.022%, for
103P and C/2009 P1, respectively, showing that HCl is depleted with respect to the solar Cl/O abundance
by a factor more than 6$^{+6}_{-3}$ in 103P, where the error is related to the uncertainty in the chlorine
solar abundance. The marginal HF detection obtained in C/2009 P1 corresponds to an HF abundance
relative to water of (1.8$\pm$0.5) $\times$ 10$^{-4}$, which is approximately consistent with
a solar photospheric F/O abundance. The observed depletion of HCl suggests that HCl was not the main
reservoir of chlorine in the regions of the solar nebula where these comets formed. HF was possibly
the main fluorine compound in the gas phase of the outer solar nebula.
