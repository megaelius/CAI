We will use new data from the High-resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C) with unprecedented spatial
resolution of the solar corona to investigate the structure of coronal loops down to 0.2 arcsec.
During a rocket flight Hi-C provided images of the solar corona in a wavelength band around 193 A that
is dominated by emission from Fe XII showing plasma at temperatures around 1.5 MK. We analyze part
of the Hi-C field-of-view to study the smallest coronal loops observed so far and search for the a
possible sub-structuring of larger loops. We find tiny 1.5 MK loop-like structures that we interpret
as miniature coronal loops. These have length of the coronal segment above the chromosphere of only
about 1 Mm and a thickness of less than 200 km. They could be interpreted as the coronal signature of
small flux tubes breaking through the photosphere with a footpoint distance corresponding to the
diameter of a cell of granulation. We find loops that are longer than 50 Mm to have a diameter of about
2 arcsec or 1.5 Mm, consistent with previous observations. However, Hi-C really resolves these
loops with some 20 pixels across the loop. Even at this greatly improved spatial resolution the large
loops seem to have no visible sub-structure. Instead they show a smooth variation in cross-section.
The fact that the large coronal loops do not show a sub-structure at the spatial scale of 0.1 arcsec
per pixel implies that either the densities and temperatures are smoothly varying across these
loops or poses an upper limit on the diameter of strands the loops might be composed of. We estimate
that strands that compose the 2 arcsec thick loop would have to be thinner than 15 km. The miniature
loops we find for the first time pose a challenge to be properly understood in terms of modeling.
