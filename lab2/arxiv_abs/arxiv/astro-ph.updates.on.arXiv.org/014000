Thanks to the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) ESO Public Survey it is now possible to explore
a large number of objects in those regions. This paper addresses the variability analysis of all
VVV point sources having more than 10 observations in VVVDR4 using a novel approach. In total, the
near-IR light curves of 288,378,769 sources were analysed using methods developed in the New Insight
Into Time Series Analysis project. As a result, we present a complete sample having 44, 998, 752 variable
star candidates (VVV-CVSC), which include accurate individual coordinates, near-IR magnitudes
(ZYJHKs), extinctions A(Ks), variability indices, periods, amplitudes, among other parameters
to assess the science. Unfortunately, a side effect of having a highly complete sample, is also having
a high level of contamination by non-variable (contamination ratio of non-variables to variables
is slightly over 10:1). To deal with this, we also provide some flags and parameters that can be used
by the community to de-crease the number of variable candidates without heavily decreasing the
completeness of the sample. In particular, we cross-identified 339,601 of our sources with Simbad
and AAVSO databases, which provide us with information for these objects at other wavelegths. This
sub-sample constitutes a unique resource to study the corresponding near-IR variability of known
sources as well as to assess the IR variability related with X-ray and Gamma-Ray sources. On the other
hand, the other 99.5% sources in our sample constitutes a number of potentially new objects with
variability information for the heavily crowded and reddened regions of the Galactic Plane and
Bulge. The present results also provide an important queryable resource to perform variability
analysis and to characterize ongoing and future surveys like TESS and LSST.
