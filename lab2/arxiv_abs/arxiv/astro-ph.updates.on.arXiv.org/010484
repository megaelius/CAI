The isolated binary evolution model for merging neutron stars (NSs) involves processes such as
mass transfer, common-envelope evolution, and natal kicks, all of which are poorly understood.
Also, the predicted NS-NS merger rates are typically lower than the rates inferred from the LIGO
GW170817 event. Here, we investigate merger rates of NS and black hole (BH)-NS binaries in hierarchical
triple-star systems. In such systems, the tertiary can induce Lidov-Kozai (LK) oscillations in
the inner binary, accelerating its coalescence, and potentially enhancing compact object merger
rates. However, since compact objects originate from massive stars, the prior evolution should
also be taken into account. Natal kicks, in particular, could significantly reduce the rates by
unbinding the tertiary before it can affect the inner binary through LK evolution. We carry out simulations
of massive triples taking into account stellar evolution starting from the main sequence, secular
and tidal evolution, and the effects of supernovae. For large NS birth kicks (\sigma_k = 265 km/s),
we find that the triple NS-NS merger rate (several hundred Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}) is lower by a factor
of ~2-3 than the binary rate, but for no kicks (\sigma_k = 0 km/s), the triple rate (several thousand
Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}) is comparable to the binary rate. Our results indicate that a significant fraction
of NS-NS mergers could originate from triples if a substantial portion of the NS population is born
with low kick velocities, as indicated by other work. However, uncertainties and open questions
remain because of our simplifying assumption of dynamical decoupling after inner binary interaction
has been triggered.
