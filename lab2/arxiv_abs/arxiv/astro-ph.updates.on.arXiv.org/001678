Fast radio bursts appear to exhibit large dispersion measures, typically exceeding any expected
galactic interstellar contribution, especially along the moderate to high-galactic-latitude
directions in which such events have been most often observed. The dispersions have been therefore
interpreted as extragalactic, leading to the inference that the sources of the bursts are at Gpc
distances. This then implies that the bursts are extremely energetic events, originating from
quite small volumes (due to the millisecond burst durations). To circumvent the energetic difficulties,
Loeb, Shvartzvald, & Maoz (2014) propose that the bursts are produced by flares near the surfaces
of M stars or contact binaries within a local volume of the galaxy. Most of the dispersion would then
occur in the overlying stellar coronae. With the dispersion concentrated in a relatively high density
region, the quadratic dispersion approximation breaks down as the plasma frequency is comparable
to (although less than) the propagation frequency. The observed dispersion curves are closely
quadratic, however, consistent with a low density medium, ruling out this model. Because any model
invoking local galactic sources would require a concentrated high density dispersing medium,
it appears highly likely that the dispersions occur in the intergalactic medium. This medium, probably
containing most of the baryon content of the universe, is expected to be highly structured on large
scales. Hot gas within clusters and especially groups of galaxies may contribute significantly
to the observed dispersion. Optical and X-ray observations, including redshifts and combined
with cosmological dispersion measures, can probe the distribution of the IGM and determine how
much of it lies outside the X-ray luminous concentrations seen in clusters and groups.
