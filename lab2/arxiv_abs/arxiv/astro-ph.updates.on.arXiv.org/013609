We present ZTF18abvkwla (the "Koala"), a fast blue optical transient discovered in the Zwicky Transient
Facility (ZTF) One-Day Cadence (1DC) Survey. ZTF18abvkwla has a number of features in common with
the groundbreaking transient AT2018cow: blue colors at peak ($g-r\approx-0.5$ mag), a short rise
time from half-max of under two days, a decay time to half-max of only three days, a high optical luminosity
($M_{g,\mathrm{peak}}\approx-20.6$mag), a hot ($\gtrsim 40,000$K) featureless spectrum at
peak light, and a luminous radio counterpart. At late times ($\Delta t>80$d) the radio luminosity
of ZTF18abvkwla ($\nu L_\nu \gtrsim 10^{40}$erg/s at 10 GHz, observer-frame) is most similar to
that of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The host galaxy is a dwarf starburst galaxy ($M\approx5\times10^{8}M_\odot$,
$\mathrm{SFR}\approx7 M_\odot$/yr) that is moderately metal-enriched ($\log\mathrm{[O/H]}
\approx 8.5$), similar to the hosts of GRBs and superluminous supernovae. As in AT2018cow, the radio
and optical emission in ZTF18abvkwla likely arise from two separate components: the radio from
fast-moving ejecta ($\Gamma \beta c >0.38c$) and the optical from shock-interaction with confined
dense material ($<0.07M_\odot$ in $\sim 10^{15}$cm). Compiling transients in the literature
with $t_\mathrm{rise} <5$d and $M_\mathrm{peak}<-20$mag, we find that a significant number are
engine-powered, and suggest that the high peak optical luminosity is directly related to the presence
of this engine. From 18 months of the 1DC survey, we find that transients in this rise-luminosity
phase space are at least two to three orders of magnitude less common than CC SNe. Finally, we discuss
strategies for identifying such events with future facilities like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope,
and prospects for detecting accompanying X-ray and radio emission.
