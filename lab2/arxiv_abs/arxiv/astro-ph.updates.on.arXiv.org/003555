We present multiband photometry of 60 spectroscopically-confirmed supernovae (SN): 39 SN II/IIP,
19 IIn, one IIb and one that was originally classified as a IIn but later as a Ibn. Forty-six have only
optical photometry, six have only near infrared (NIR) photometry and eight have both optical and
NIR. The median redshift of the sample is 0.016. We also present 192 optical spectra for 47 of the 60
SN. All data are publicly available. There are 26 optical and two NIR light curves of SN II/IIP with
redshifts z > 0.01, some of which may give rise to useful distances for cosmological applications.
All photometry was obtained between 2000 and 2011 at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO),
via the 1.2m and 1.3m PAIRITEL telescopes for the optical and NIR, respectively. Each SN was observed
in a subset of the $u'UBVRIr'i'JHK_s$ bands. There are a total of 2932 optical and 816 NIR light curve
points. Optical spectra were obtained using the FLWO 1.5m Tillinghast telescope with the FAST spectrograph
and the MMT Telescope with the Blue Channel Spectrograph. Our photometry is in reasonable agreement
with other samples from the literature. Comparison with Pan-STARRS shows that two-thirds of our
individual star sequences have weighted-mean V offsets within $\pm$0.02 mag. In comparing our
standard-system SN light curves with common Carnegie Supernova Project objects using their color
terms, we found that roughly three-quarters have average differences within $\pm$0.04 mag. The
data from this work and the literature will provide insight into SN II explosions, help with developing
methods for photometric SN classification, and contribute to their use as cosmological distance
indicators.
