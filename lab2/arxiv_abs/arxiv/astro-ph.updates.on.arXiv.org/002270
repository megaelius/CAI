Context. The study of the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF) in relation to the galaxy environment
and the stellar mass density profile, rho(r), is a powerful tool to constrain models of galaxy evolution.
Aims. We determine the SMF of the z=0.44 cluster of galaxies MACS J1206.2-0847 separately for passive
and star-forming (SF) galaxies, in different regions of the cluster, from the center out to approximately
2 virial radii. We also determine rho(r) to compare it to the number density and total mass density
profiles. Methods. We use the dataset from the CLASH-VLT survey. Stellar masses are obtained by
SED fitting on 5-band photometric data obtained at the Subaru telescope. We identify 1363 cluster
members down to a stellar mass of 10^9.5 Msolar. Results. The whole cluster SMF is well fitted by a
double Schechter function. The SMFs of cluster SF and passive galaxies are statistically different.
The SMF of the SF cluster galaxies does not depend on the environment. The SMF of the passive population
has a significantly smaller slope (in absolute value) in the innermost (<0.50 Mpc), highest
density cluster region, than in more external, lower density regions. The number ratio of giant/subgiant
galaxies is maximum in this innermost region and minimum in the adjacent region, but then gently
increases again toward the cluster outskirts. This is also reflected in a decreasing radial trend
of the average stellar mass per cluster galaxy. On the other hand, the stellar mass fraction, i.e.,
the ratio of stellar to total cluster mass, does not show any significant radial trend. Conclusions.
Our results appear consistent with a scenario in which SF galaxies evolve into passive galaxies
due to density-dependent environmental processes, and eventually get destroyed very near the
cluster center to become part of a diffuse intracluster medium. (abridged)
