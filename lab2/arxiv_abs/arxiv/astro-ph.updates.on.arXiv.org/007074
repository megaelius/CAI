There have been many efforts to correct systematic effects in astronomical light curves to improve
the detection and characterization of planetary transits and astrophysical variability. Algorithms
like the Trend Filtering Algorithm (TFA) use simultaneously-observed stars to remove systematic
effects, and binning is used to reduce high-frequency random noise. We present TFAW, a wavelet-based
modified version of TFA. TFAW aims to increase the periodic signal detection and to return a detrended
and denoised signal without modifying its intrinsic characteristics. We modify TFA's frequency
analysis step adding a Stationary Wavelet Transform filter to perform an initial noise and outlier
removal and increase the detection of variable signals. A wavelet filter is added to TFA's signal
reconstruction to perform an adaptive characterization of the noise- and trend-free signal and
the noise contribution at each iteration while preserving astrophysical signals. We carried out
tests over simulated sinusoidal and transit-like signals to assess the effectiveness of the method
and applied TFAW to real light curves from TFRM. We also studied TFAW's application to simulated
multiperiodic signals, improving their characterization. TFAW improves the signal detection
rate by increasing the signal detection efficiency (SDE) up to a factor ~2.5x for low SNR light curves.
For simulated transits, the transit detection rate improves by a factor ~2-5x in the low-SNR regime
compared to TFA. TFAW signal approximation performs up to a factor ~2x better than bin averaging
for planetary transits. The standard deviations of simulated and real TFAW light curves are ~40x
better than TFA. TFAW yields better MCMC posterior distributions and returns lower uncertainties,
less biased transit parameters and narrower (~10x) credibility intervals for simulated transits.
We present a newly-discovered variable star from TFRM.
