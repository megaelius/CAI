We present two catalogues of active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates selected from the latest
data of two all-sky surveys -- Data Release 2 (DR2) of the \emph{Gaia} mission and the unWISE catalogue
of the \emph{Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer} (\emph{WISE}). We train a random forest classifier
to predict the probability of each source in the \emph{Gaia}-unWISE joint sample being an AGN, $P_{\rm
RF}$, based on \emph{Gaia} astrometric and photometric measurements and unWISE photometry. The
two catalogues, which we designate C75 and R85, are constructed by applying different $P_{\rm RF}$
threshold cuts to achieve an overall completeness of 75\% ($\approx$90\% at \emph{Gaia} $G\leq20$
mag) and reliability of 85\% respectively. The C75 (R85) catalogue contains 2,734,464 (2,182,193)
AGN candidates across the effective 36,000 deg$^2$ sky, of which $\approx$0.91 (0.52) million
are new discoveries. Photometric redshifts of the AGN candidates are derived by a random forest
regressor using \emph{Gaia} and \emph{WISE} magnitudes and colours. The estimated overall photometric
redshift accuracy is 0.11. Cross-matching the AGN candidates with a sample of known bright cluster
galaxies, we identify a high-probability strongly-lensed AGN candidate system, SDSS\,J1326$+$4806,
with a large image separation of 21\farcs06. All the AGN candidates in our catalogues will have $\sim$5-year
long light curves from \emph{Gaia} by the end of the mission, and thus will be a great resource for
AGN variability studies. Our AGN catalogues will also be helpful in AGN target selections for future
spectroscopic surveys, especially ones in the southern hemisphere. The C75 catalogue can be downloaded
