We present results from modeling the optical spectra of a large sample of quiescent galaxies between
0.1 < z < 0.7 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey
(AGES). We examine how the stellar ages and abundance patterns of galaxies evolve over time as a function
of stellar mass from 10^{9.6}-10^{11.8} Msun. Galaxy spectra are stacked in bins of mass and redshift,
and modeled over a wavelength range from 4000 A to 5500 A. Full spectrum stellar population synthesis
modeling provides estimates of the age and the abundances of the elements Fe, Mg, C, N, and Ca. We find
negligible evolution in elemental abundances at fixed stellar mass over roughly 7 Gyr of cosmic
time. In addition, the increase in stellar ages with time for massive galaxies is consistent with
passive evolution since z = 0.7. Taken together, these results favor a scenario in which the inner
~ 0.3-3 R_e of massive quiescent galaxies have been passively evolving over the last half of cosmic
time. Interestingly, the derived stellar ages are considerably younger than the age of the universe
at all epochs, consistent with an equivalent single-burst star formation epoch of z < 1.5. These
young stellar population ages coupled with the existence of massive quiescent galaxies at z >
1 indicate the inhomogeneous nature of the z < 0.7 quiescent population. The data also permit
the addition of newly-quenched galaxies at masses below ~10^{10.5} Msun at z < 0.7. Additionally,
we analyze very deep Keck DEIMOS spectra of the two brightest quiescent galaxies in a cluster at z
= 0.83. There is tentative evidence that these galaxies are older than their counterparts in low-density
environments. In the Appendix, we demonstrate that our full spectrum modeling technique allows
for accurate and reliable modeling of galaxy spectra to low S/N (~20 A^{-1}) and/or low spectral
resolution (R ~ 500).
