Context. Spectroscopy of exoplanets is very challenging because of the high star-planet contrast.
A technical difficulty in the design of imaging instruments is the noncommon path aberrations (NCPAs)
between the adaptive optics (AO) sensing and the science camera, which induce planet-resembling
stellar speckles in the coronagraphic science images. In an observing sequence of several long
exposures, quickly evolving NCPAs average out and leave behind an AO halo that adds photon noise
to the planet detection. Static NCPA can be calibrated a posteriori using differential imaging
techniques. However, NCPAs that evolve during the observing sequence do not average out and cannot
be calibrated a posteriori. These quasi-static NCPAs are one of the main limitations of the current
direct imaging instruments such as SPHERE, GPI, and SCExAO. Aims. Our aim is to actively minimize
the quasi-static speckles induced in long-exposure images. To do so, we need to measure the quasi-static
speckle field above the AO halo. Methods. The self-coherent camera (SCC) is a proven technique which
measures the speckle complex field in the coronagraphic science images. It is routinely used on
the THD2 bench to reach contrast levels of <10^{-8} in the range 5-12 {\lambda}/D in space-related
conditions. To test the SCC in ground conditions on THD2, we optically simulated the residual aberrations
measured behind the SPHERE/VLT AO system under good observing conditions. Results. We demonstrate
in the laboratory that the SCC can minimize the quasi-static speckle intensity in the science images
down to a limitation set by the AO halo residuals. The SCC reaches 1{\sigma} raw contrast levels below
10^{-6} in the region 5-12 {\lambda}/D at 783.25 nm in our experiments.
