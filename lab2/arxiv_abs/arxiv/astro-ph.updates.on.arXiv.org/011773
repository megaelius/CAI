According to the "no-hair" conjecture, a Kerr black hole (BH) is completely described by its mass
and spin. In particular, the spin-induced quadrupole moment of a Kerr BH with mass $m$ and dimensionless
spin $\chi$ can be written as $Q=-\kappa\,m^3\chi^2$, where $\kappa_{\rm BH}=1$. Thus by measuring
the spin-induced quadrupole parameter $\kappa$, we can test the binary black hole nature of compact
binaries and distinguish them from binaries comprised of other exotic compact objects, as proposed
in [N. V. Krishnendu et al., PRL 119, 091101 (2017)]. Here, we present a Bayesian framework to carry
out this test where we measure the symmetric combination of individual spin-induced quadrupole
moment parameters fixing the anti-symmetric combination to be zero. The analysis is restricted
to the inspiral part of the signal as the spin-induced deformations are not modeled in the post-inspiral
regime. We perform detailed simulations to investigate the applicability of this method for compact
binaries of different masses and spins and also explore various degeneracies in the parameter space
which can affect this test. We then apply this method to the gravitational wave events, GW151226
and GW170608 detected during the first and second observing runs of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo
detectors. We find the two events to be consistent with binary black hole mergers in general relativity.
By combining information from several more of such events in future, this method can be used to set
constraints on the black hole nature of the population of compact binaries that are detected by the
Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors.
