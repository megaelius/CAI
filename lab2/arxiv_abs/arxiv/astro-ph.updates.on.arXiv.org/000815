We investigate the connection between the epoch of reionization and the present day universe, by
examining the extended mass reionization histories of dark matter halos identified at z=0. We combine
an N-body dark matter simulation of a 600 Mpc volume with a three-dimensional, seminumerical reionization
model. This provides reionization redshifts for each particle, which can then be connected with
the properties of their halos at the present time. We find that the vast majority of present-day halos
with masses larger than ~ few x 10^11 Msun reionize earlier than the rest of the universe. We also find
significant halo-to-halo diversity in mass reionization histories, and find that in realistic
inhomogenous models, the material within a given halo is not expected to reionize at the same time.
In particular, the scatter in reionization times within individual halos is typically larger than
the scatter among halos. From our fiducial reionization model, we find that the typical 68% scatter
in reionization times within halos is ~ 115 Myr for 10^(12 \pm 0.25) Msun halos, decreasing slightly
to ~ 95 Myr for 10^(15 \pm 0.25) Msun halos. We find a mild correlation between reionization history
and environment: halos with shorter reionization histories are typically in more clustered environments,
with the strongest trend on a scale of ~ 20 Mpc. Material in Milky Way mass halos with short reionization
histories is preferentially reionized in relatively large HII regions, implying reionization
mostly by sources external to the progenitors of the present-day halo. We investigate the impact
on our results of varying the reionization model parameters, which span a range of reionization
scenarios with varying timing and morphology.
