Today's picture of the internal solar rotation rate profile results essentially from helioseismic
analyses of frequency splittings of resonant acoustic waves. Here we present another, complementary
estimation of the internal solar rotation rate using the perturbation of the shape of the acoustic
waves. For this purpose, we extend a global helioseismic approach developed previously for the
investigation of the meridional flow \cite{schad11, schad12, schad13} to work on the components
of the differential rotation. We discuss the effect of rotation on mode eigenfunctions and thereon
based observables. Based on a numerical study using a simulated rotation rate profile we tailor
an inversion approach and also consider the case of the presence of an additional meridional flow.
This inversion approach is then applied to data from the MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager aboard the
Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO)) instrument and the HMI (Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)) instrument. In the end, rotation rate profiles estimated
from eigenfunction perturbation and frequency splittings are compared. The rotation rate profiles
from the two different approaches are qualitatively in good agreement, especially for the MDI data.
Significant differences are obtained at high latitudes $> 50^{\circ}$ and near the subsurface.
The result from HMI data shows larger discrepancies between the different methods. We find that
the two global helioseismic approaches provide complementary methods for measuring solar rotation.
Comparing the results from different methods may help to reveal systematic influences that affect
analyses based on eigenfunction perturbations, like meridional flow measurements.
