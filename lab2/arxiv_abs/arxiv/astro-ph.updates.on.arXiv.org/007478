We investigate the parameters of global solar p-mode oscillations, namely damping width $\Gamma$,
amplitude $A$, mean squared velocity $\langle v^2\rangle$, energy $E$, and energy supply rate
$\mathrm{d}E/\mathrm{d} t$, derived from two solar cycles' worth (1996 - 2018) of Global Oscillation
Network Group (GONG) time series for harmonic degrees $l=0 - 150$. We correct for the effect of fill
factor, apparent solar radius, and spurious jumps in the mode amplitudes. We find that the amplitude
of the activity related changes of $\Gamma$ and $A$ depends on both frequency and harmonic degree
of the modes, with the largest variations of $\Gamma$ for modes with $2400\,\mu\text{Hz}\le \nu
\le 3300\,\mu\text{Hz}$ and $31\le l \le 60$ with a min-to-max variation of $26.6\pm0.3\%$ and
of $A$ for modes with $2400\,\mu\text{Hz}\le\nu\le 3300\,\mu\text{Hz}$ and $61\le l \le 100$
with a min-to-max variation of $27.4\pm0.4\%$. The level of correlation between the solar radio
flux $F_{10.7}$ and mode parameters also depends on mode frequency and harmonic degree. As a function
of mode frequency, the mode amplitudes are found to follow an asymmetric Voigt profile with $\nu_{\text{max}}=3073.59\pm0.18\,\mu\text{Hz}$.
From the mode parameters, we calculate physical mode quantities and average them over specific
mode frequency ranges. This way, we find that the mean squared velocities $\langle v^2\rangle$
and energies $E$ of p modes are anti-correlated with the level of activity, varying by $14.7\pm0.3\%$
and $18.4\pm0.3\%$, respectively, and that the mode energy supply rates show no significant correlation
with activity. With this study we expand previously published results on the temporal variation
of solar p-mode parameters. Our results will be helpful to future studies of the excitation and damping
of p modes, i.e., the interplay between convection, magnetic field, and resonant acoustic oscillations.
