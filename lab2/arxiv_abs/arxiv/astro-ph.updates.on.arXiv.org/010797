The primary X-ray emission in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is widely believed to be due to Comptonisation
of the thermal radiation from the accretion disc in a corona of hot electrons. The resulting spectra
can, in first approximation, be modelled with a cut-off power law, the photon index and the high-energy
roll-over encoding information on the physical properties of the X-ray-emitting region. The photon
index and the high-energy curvature of AGNs ($\Gamma$, E$_c$) have been largely studied since the
launch of X-ray satellites operating above 10 keV. However, high-precision measurements of these
two observables have only been obtained in recent years thanks to the unprecedented sensitivity
of NuSTAR up to 79 keV. We aim at deriving relations between phenomenological parameters ($\Gamma$
and E$_c$) and the intrinsic properties of the X-ray-emitting region (the hot corona), namely the
optical depth and temperature. We use MoCA (Monte Carlo code for Comptonisation in Astrophysics)
to produce synthetic spectra for the case of an AGN with M$_{BH}$=1.5$\times$10$^8$ M$_{sun}$
and accretion rate of 10% and then compared them with the widely used power-law model with an exponential
high-energy cutoff. We provide phenomenological relations relating $\Gamma$ and E$_c$ with the
opacity and temperature of the coronal electrons for the case of spherical and slab-like coronae.
These relations give origin to a well defined parameter space which fully contains the observed
values. Exploiting the increasing number of high-energy cut-offs quoted in the literature, we
report on the comparison of physical quantities obtained using MoCA with those estimated using
commonly adopted spectral Comptonisation models. Finally, we discuss the negligible impact of
different black hole masses and accretion rates on the inferred relations.
