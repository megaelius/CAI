We have used the full radial extent of images from the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for
Surveys and Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 to extract surface brightness profiles from a sample of
six, local lenticular galaxy candidates. We have modelled these profiles using a core-Sersic bulge
plus an exponential disk model. Our lenticular disk galaxies with bulge magnitudes M_V < ~ -21.30
mag have central stellar deficits, suggesting that these bulges may have formed from `dry' merger
events involving supermassive black holes while their surrounding disk was subsequently built
up, perhaps via cold gas accretion scenarios. The central stellar mass deficits M_def are roughly
0.5 to 2 M_BH (black hole mass), rather than ~ 10 to 20 M_BH as claimed from some past studies, which
is in accord with core-Sersic model mass deficit measurements in elliptical galaxies. Furthermore,
these bulges have Sersic indices n ~ 3, half light radii R_e < 2 kpc and masses > 10^11 M_sun,
and therefore appear to be descendants of the compact galaxies reported at z ~ 1.5 to 2. Past studies
which have searched for these local counterparts by using single-component galaxy models to provide
the z ~ 0 size comparisons have over-looked these dense, compact and massive bulges in today's early-type
disk galaxies. This evolutionary scenario not only accounts for what are today generally old bulges---which
must be present in z ~ 1.5 images---residing in what are generally young disks, but it eliminates
the uncomfortable suggestion of a factor of 3 to 5 growth in size for the compact, z ~ 1.5 galaxies that
are known to possess infant disks.
