The origin of the black-hole:black-hole mergers discovered through gravitational waves with
for example the LIGO/Virgo collaboration are a mystery. We investigate the idea that some of these
black holes originate from the centers of extremely low-mass ultra-dwarf galaxies that have merged
together in the distant past at $z>1$. Extrapolating the central black hole to stellar mass ratio
suggests that the black holes in these mergers could arise from galaxies of masses $\sim 10^{5} -
10^{6}$ M$_{\odot}\,$. We investigate whether these galaxies merge enough, or too much, to be consistent
with the observed GW rate of $\sim 9.7-101$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ using the latest LIGO/Virgo results.
We show that in the nearby universe the merger rate and number densities of ultra-dwarf galaxies
are too low, by an order or magnitude, to produce these black hole mergers. However, by considering
that the merger fraction, merger-time scales, and the number densities of low-mass galaxies all
conspire at $z>1-1.5$ to increase the merger rate for these galaxies at higher redshifts we argue
that it is possible that some of the observed GW events arise from BHs in the centers of low-mass galaxies.
The major uncertainty in this calculation is the dynamical time-scales for black holes in low-mass
galaxies. Our results however suggest a very long BH merger time-scale of 4-7 Gyr, consistent with
an extended black hole merger history. Further simulations are needed to verify this possibility,
however our theory can be tested by searching for host galaxies of gravitational wave events. Results
from these searches would will put limits on dwarf galaxy mergers and/or the presence and formation
mechanisms of black holes through PopIII stars in the lowest mass galaxies.
