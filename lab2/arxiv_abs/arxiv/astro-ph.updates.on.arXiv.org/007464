Cosmic connectivity and multiplicity, i.e. the number of filaments globally or locally connected
to a given cluster is a natural probe of the growth of structure and in particular of the nature of dark
energy. It is also a critical ingredient driving the assembly history of galaxies as it controls
mass and angular momentum accretion. The connectivity of the cosmic web is investigated here via
the persistent skeleton. This tool identifies topologically the set of ridges of the cosmic landscape
which allows us to investigate in details how the nodes of the cosmic web are connected together.
When applied to Gaussian random fields, it is found that on average the nodes are connected to exactly
$\kappa=4$ neighbours in two dimensions and ~6.1 in three dimensions. Investigating spatial dimensions
up to d=11, typical departures from a cubic lattice $\kappa=2d$ are shown to scale like the power
7/4 of the dimension. These numbers strongly depend on the height of the peaks: the higher the peak
the larger the connectivity. Locally, the number of filaments sticking out from a node is not equal
to its number of connections. At small distance, the peak has an ellipsoidal shape so that only two
filaments emerge. Further away, filaments are subdivided at bifurcation points. At the resolution
of the maps, the local number of filaments is 3 on average in 2D and 4 in 3D, depending on the height of
the peak. Predictions from first principles based on peak theory are shown to reproduce well the
connectivity and multiplicity of Gaussian random fields and cosmological simulations. As an illustration,
this connectivity is quantified in galaxy lensing convergence maps and large dark haloes catalogues.
As a function of redshift and scale the mean connectivity decreases in a cosmology dependent way.
As a function of halo mass it scales like 10/3 times the log of the mass.
