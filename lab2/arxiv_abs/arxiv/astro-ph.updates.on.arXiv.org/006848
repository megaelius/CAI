A large filament composed principally of two sections erupted sequentially in the southern hemisphere
on January 26 2016. The central, thick part of the northern section was first lifted up and lead to
the eruption of the full filament. This event was observed in H-alpha with GONG and CLIMSO, and in
ultraviolet (UV) with the AIA/SDO imager. The aim of the paper is to relate the photospheric motions
below the filament and its environment to the eruption of the filament. An analysis of the photospheric
motions using SDO/HMI continuum images with the coherent structure tracking (CST) algorithm developed
to track granules, as well as large-scale photospheric flows, has been performed. The supergranule
pattern is clearly visible outside the filament channel but difficult to detect inside because
the modulus of the vector velocity is reduced in the filament channel, mainly in the magnetized areas.
The horizontal photospheric flows are strong on the west side of the filament channel and oriented
towards the filament. The ends of the filament sections are found in areas of concentration of corks.
Whirled flows are found locally around the feet. The strong horizontal flows with an opposite direction
to the differential rotation create strong shear and convergence along the magnetic polarity inversion
line (PIL) in the filament channel. The filament has been destabilized by the converging flows,
which initiate an ascent of the middle section of the filament until the filament reaches the critical
height of the torus instability inducing, consequently, the eruption. The "n" decay index indicated
an altitude of 60 Mm for the critical height. It is conjectured that the convergence along the PIL
is due to the large-scale size cells of convection that transport the magnetic field to their borders.
