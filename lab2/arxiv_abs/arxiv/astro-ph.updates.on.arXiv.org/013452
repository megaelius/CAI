TianQin is a proposed space-based gravitational wave observatory. It is designed to detect the
gravitational wave signals in the frequency range of 0.1 mHz -- 1 Hz. At a geocentric distance of $10^5$
km, the plasma in the earth magnetosphere will contribute as the main source of environmental noises.
Here, we analyze the acceleration noises that are caused by the magnetic field of space plasma for
the test mass of TianQin. The real solar wind data observed by the Advanced Composition Explorer
are taken as the input of the magnetohydrodynamic simulation. The Space Weather Modeling Framework
is used to simulate the global magnetosphere of the earth, from which we obtain the plasma and magnetic
field parameters on the detector's orbits. We calculate the time series of the residual accelerations
and the corresponding amplitude spectral densities on these orbit configurations. We find that
the residual acceleration produced by the interaction between the TM's magnetic moment induced
by the space magnetic field and the spacecraft magnetic field ($\bm{a}_{\rm M1}$) is the dominant
term, which can approach $10^{-15}$ m/s$^2$/Hz$^{1/2}$ at $f\lesssim 0.2$ mHz for the nominal
values of the magnetic susceptibility ($\chi_{\rm m} = 10^{-5}$) and the magnetic shielding factor
($\xi_{\rm m} = 10$) of the test mass. The ratios between the amplitude spectral density of the acceleration
noise caused by the space magnetic field and the preliminary goal of the inertial sensor are 0.34
and 0.07 at 1 mHz and 10 mHz, respectively. We discuss the further reduction of this acceleration
noise by decreasing $\chi_{\rm m}$ and/or increasing $\xi_{\rm m}$ in the future instrumentation
development for TianQin.
