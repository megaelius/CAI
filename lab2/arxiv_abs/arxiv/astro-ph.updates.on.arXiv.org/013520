Interstellar space hosts nanometre- to micron-sized dust grains. The carbonaceous-rich component
of these grain populations emits in infrared bands, observed remotely for decades with telescopes
and satellites. They are a key ingredient of astrochemical dust evolution. The precise carriers
for most of these bands are still unknown and not well reproduced in the laboratory. In this work,
we show the high-energy mechanochemical synthesis of disordered aromatic and aliphatic analogues
provides interstellar relevant dust particles. The mechanochemical milling of carbon-based
solids under a hydrogen atmosphere produces particles with a spectroscopic match to astrophysical
observations of aromatic infrared band (AIB) emission. The H/C ratio for the analogues that best
reproduce these astronomical infrared observations lies in the 5$\pm$2% range. This value is much
lower than diffuse interstellar hydrogenated amorphous carbons, another Galactic dust grain
component observed in absorption, and it most probably provides a constraint on the hydrogenation
degree of the most aromatic carbonaceous dust grain carriers. A broad band, observed in AIBs, in
the 7.4-8.3 $\mu$m range is correlated to the hydrogen content, and thus the structural evolution
in the analogues produced. The mechanochemical process can be seen as an experimental reactor to
stimulate local energetic chemical reactions. It introduces bond disorder and hydrogen chemical
attachment on the produced defects, with an effect similar to the interstellar space very localised
chemical reactions with solids. From the vantage point of astrophysics, these laboratory interstellar
dust analogues will be used to predict dust grain evolution under simulated interstellar conditions,
including harsh radiative environments. Such interstellar analogues offer an opportunity to
derive a global view on the cycling of matter in other star forming systems.
