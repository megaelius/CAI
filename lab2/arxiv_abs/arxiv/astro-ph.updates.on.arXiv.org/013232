We propose a light-weight deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate the cosmological
parameters from simulated 3-dimensional dark matter distributions with high accuracy. The training
set is based on 465 realizations of a cubic box with a side length of $256\ h^{-1}\ \rm Mpc$, sampled
with $128^3$ particles interpolated over a cubic grid of $128^3$ voxels. These volumes have cosmological
parameters varying within the flat $\Lambda$CDM parameter space of $0.16 \leq \Omega_m \leq 0.46$
and $2.0 \leq 10^9 A_s \leq 2.3$. The neural network takes as an input cubes with $32^3$ voxels and
has three convolution layers, three dense layers, together with some batch normalization and pooling
layers. In the final predictions from the network we find a $2.5\%$ bias on the primordial amplitude
$\sigma_8$ that can not easily be resolved by continued training. We correct this bias to obtain
unprecedented accuracy in the cosmological parameter estimation with statistical uncertainties
of $\delta \Omega_m$=0.0015 and $\delta \sigma_8$=0.0029, which are several times better than
the results of previous CNN works. Compared with a 2-point analysis method using clustering region
of 0-130 and 10-130 $h^{-1}$ Mpc, the CNN constraints are several times and an order of magnitude
more precise, respectively. Finally, we conduct preliminary checks of the error-tolerance abilities
of the neural network, and find that it exhibits robustness against smoothing, masking, random
noise, global variation, rotation, reflection, and simulation resolution. Those effects are
well understood in typical clustering analysis, but had not been tested before for the CNN approach.
Our work shows that CNN can be more promising than people expected in deriving tight cosmological
constraints from the cosmic large scale structure.
