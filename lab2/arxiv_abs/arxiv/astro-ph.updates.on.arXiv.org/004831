We analyzed a small flux rope eruption converted into a helical blowout jet in a fan-spine configuration
using multi-wavelength observations taken by SDO, which occurred near the limb on 2016 January
9. In our study, first, we estimated the fan-spine magnetic configuration with the potential field
calculation and found a sinistral small filament inside it. The filament along with the flux rope
erupted upward and interacted with the surrounding fan- spine magnetic configuration, where the
flux rope breaks in the middle section. We observed compact brightening, flare ribbons and post-flare
loops underneath the erupting filament. The northern section of the flux rope reconnected with
the surrounding positive polarity, while the southern section straightened. Next, we observed
the untwisting motion of the southern leg, which was transformed into a rotating helical blowout
jet. The sign of the helicity of the mini-filament matches the one of the rotating jet. This is consistent
with the jet models presented by Adams et al. (2014) and Sterling et al. (2015). We focused on the fine
thread structure of the rotating jet and traced three blobs with the speed of 60-120 km/s, while the
radial speed of the jet is approx 400 km/s. The untwisting motion of the jet accelerated plasma upward
along the collimated outer spine field lines, and it finally evolved into a narrow coronal mass ejection
at the height of approx 9 Rsun . On the basis of the detailed analysis, we discussed clear evidence
of the scenario of the breaking of the flux rope and the formation of the helical blowout jet in the
fan-spine magnetic configuration.
