We examine the frequencies of the fundamental ($f$-) and the gravity ($g_i$-) mode in gravitational
waves from accreting protoneutron stars (PNSs) toward black hole formation. For this purpose,
we analyze numerical results of gravitational collapse of massive stars for two different progenitors
with three equations of state. We adopt profiles of central objects obtained from the numerical
simulations by solving general relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics under the spherical
symmetry. Using a series of snapshots as a static configuration at each time step, we solve the eigenvalue
problem to determine the specific frequencies of gravitational waves from the evolving PNSs with
accretion from core bounce to black hole formation by the relativistic Cowling approximation.
We find that the frequency of the $f$-mode gravitational waves can be expressed as a function of the
average density of the PNS at each time step almost independently of the progenitor models in accord
with the previous studies on ordinary PNSs. We also find that the ratio of the $g_1$-mode frequency
to the $f$-mode frequency is insensitive to the progenitor, but strongly depends on the compactness
of the PNSs. Having a simultaneous observation of the $f$- and $g_1$-mode gravitational waves,
it would provide the information of the average density and compactness of PNS, which can reconstruct
the evolution of mass and radius of the PNSs as a constraint on the equation of state at high densities.
Furthermore, we show that the highest average density of the PNS with the maximum mass can be estimated
with the detection of the $f$-mode gravitational waves together with the help of the neutrino observations.
