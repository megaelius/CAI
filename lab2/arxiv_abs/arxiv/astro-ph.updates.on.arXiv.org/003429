We present a $^{13}\mathrm{CO} (J = 1 \rightarrow 0)$ mapping survey of 12 nearby galaxies from the
CARMA STING sample. The line intensity ratio $\mathcal{R} \equiv I[^{12}\mathrm{CO} (J = 1 \rightarrow
0)]/I[^{13}\mathrm{CO} (J = 1 \rightarrow 0)]$ is derived to study the variations in molecular
gas properties. For 11 galaxies where it can be measured with high significance, the spatially resolved
$\mathcal{R}$ on (sub-)kiloparsec scales varies by up to a factor of 3--5 within a galaxy. Lower
$\mathcal{R}$ values are usually found in regions with weaker $^{12}\rm CO$. We attribute this
apparent trend to a bias against measuring large $\mathcal{R}$ values when $^{12}\rm CO$ is weak.
Limiting our analysis to the $^{12}\rm CO$ bright regions that are less biased, we do not find $\mathcal{R}$
on (sub)kpc scales correlate with galactocentric distance, velocity dispersion or the star formation
rate. The lack of correlation between SFR and $\mathcal{R}$ indicates that the CO optical depth
is not sensitive to stellar energy input, or that any such sensitivity is easily masked by other factors.
Extending the analysis to all regions with $\rm ^{12}CO$ emission by spectral stacking, we find
that 5 out of 11 galaxies show higher stacked $\mathcal{R}$ for galactocentric radii of $\gtrsim
1$ kpc and $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}} \lesssim 0.1 \rm \ M_{sun} yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}$, which could result
from a greater contribution from diffuse gas. Moreover, significant galaxy-to-galaxy variations
are found in $\mathcal{R}$, but the global $\mathcal{R}$ does not strongly depend on dust temperature,
inclination, or metallicity of the galaxy.
