We examine the dynamical properties of interacting galaxies and the properties of shocked gas produced
as a result of the interaction. We observed 22 galaxy mergers using the SparsePak IFU at Kitt Peak
National Observatory (KPNO). The goal of the observations was to obtain the H$\alpha$ velocity
maps over the entire luminous parts of the galaxies including the faint tidal tails, and to find extended
shocks and outflows. Our sample consists of major and minor galaxy mergers with mass ratios $1<\mu<8$.
We fit multiple kinematic components to the H$\alpha$ and [N II] emission lines, develop an MCMC
code to robustly estimate the error of fit parameters, and use the F-test to determine the best number
of kinematic components for each fiber. We use [N II]/H$\alpha$ and velocity dispersion of components
to separate star-forming (HII) regions from shocks. We use the kinematics of the H$\alpha$ emission
from HII regions and an automated modeling method to put the first ever constraints on the encounter
parameters of one of the observed systems. Besides, we estimate the fraction of shocked H$\alpha$
emission, $\text{f}_\text{shocked}$, and examine the spatial distribution of shocks. We find
that close galaxy pairs have, on average, a higher shock fraction than wide pairs, and coalesced
mergers have the highest average $\text{f}_\text{shocked}$. In addition, galaxy pairs with more
equal mass ratio tend to have a higher $\text{f}_\text{shocked}$. Combining the dynamical models
from the literature and this work, we inspect trends between $\text{f}_\text{shocked}$ and dynamical
encounter parameters. Our findings are generally consistent with shocks being produced either
by direct collision of the ISM or by the chain of events provoked by the tidal impulse during the first
passage.
