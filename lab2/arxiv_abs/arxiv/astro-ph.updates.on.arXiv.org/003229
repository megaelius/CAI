We examine the flavor evolution of neutrinos emitted from the disk-like remnant (hereafter called
\lq\lq neutrino disk\rq\rq) of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger. We specifically follow the neutrinos
emitted from the center of the disk, along the polar axis perpendicular to the equatorial plane.
We carried out two-flavor simulations using a variety of different possible initial neutrino luminosities
and energy spectra, and for comparison, three-flavor simulations in specific cases. In all simulations,
the normal neutrino mass hierarchy was used. The flavor evolution was found to be highly dependent
on the initial neutrino luminosities and energy spectra; in particular, we found two broad classes
of results depending on the sign of the initial net electron neutrino lepton number (i.e., the number
of neutrinos minus the number of antineutrinos). In the antineutrino dominated case, we found that
the Matter-Neutrino Resonance (MNR) effect dominates, consistent with previous results, whereas
in the neutrino dominated case, a bipolar spectral swap develops. The neutrino dominated conditions
required for this latter result have been realized, e.g, in a BNS merger simulation that employs
the \lq\lq DD2\rq\rq\ equation of state for neutron star matter[Phys. Rev. D 93, 044019 (2016)].
For this case, in addition to the swap at low energies, a collective Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein
(MSW) mechanism generates a high-energy electron neutrino tail. The enhanced population of high-energy
electron neutrinos in this scenario could have implications for the prospects of $r$-process nucleosynthesis
in the material ejected outside the plane of the neutrino disk.
