Gravitational waves can be focussed by the gravity of an intervening galaxy, just like light, thereby
magnifying binary merging events in the far Universe. High magnification by galaxies is found to
be responsible for the brightest sources detected in sky surveys, but the low angular resolution
of LIGO/Virgo is insufficient to check this lensing possibility directly. Here we find that the
first six binary black hole (BBH) merging events reported by LIGO/Virgo show clear evidence for
lensing in the plane of observed mass and source distance. The four lowest frequency events follow
an apparent locus in this plane, which we can reproduce by galaxy lensing, where the higher the magnification,
the generally more distant the source so the wave train is stretched more by the Universal expansion,
by factors of 2-4. This revises the reported BBH distances upwards by an order of magnitude, equal
to the square root of the magnification. Furthermore, the reported black hole masses must be decreased
by 2-4 to counter the larger stretch factor, since the orbital frequency is used to derive the black
hole masses. This lowers the masses to 5-15 solar, well below the puzzlingly high values of 20-35
solar masses otherwise estimated, with the attraction of finding agreement in mass with black holes
orbiting stars in our own Galaxy, thereby implying a stellar origin for the low frequency events
in the far Universe. We also show that the other two BBH events of higher frequency detected by LIGO/VIRGO,
lie well below the lensing locus, consistent with being nearby and unlensed. If this apparent division
between local and distant lensed events is reinforced by new detections then the spins and masses
of stellar black holes can be compared over a timespan of 10 billion years by LIGO/Virgo.
