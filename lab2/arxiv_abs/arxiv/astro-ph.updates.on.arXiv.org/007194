We use fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations with unprecedentedly large transverse box
sizes to study particle acceleration in weakly-magnetized mildly relativistic shocks traveling
at a velocity $\approx 0.75c$ and a Mach number of 15. We examine both subluminal (quasi-parallel)
and superluminal (quasi-perpendicular) magnetic field orientations. We find that quasi-parallel
shocks are mediated by a filamentary non-resonant (Bell) instability driven by non-thermal ions,
producing magnetic fluctuations on scales comparable to the ion gyro-radius. In quasi-parallel
shocks, both electrons and ions are accelerated into non-thermal power-laws whose maximum energy
grows linearly with time. The upstream heating of electrons is small, and the two species enter the
shock front in rough thermal equilibrium. The shock's structure is complex; the current of reflected
non-thermal ions evacuates cavities in the upstream which form filaments of amplified magnetic
fields once advected downstream. At late times, $10\%$ of the shock's energy goes into non-thermal
protons and $\gtrsim10\%$ into magnetic fields. We find that properly capturing the magnetic turbulence
driven by the non-thermal ions is important for properly measuring the energy fraction of non-thermal
electrons, $\epsilon_e$. We find $\epsilon_e\sim 5\times10^{-4}$ for quasi-parallel shocks
with $v=0.75c$, slightly larger than what was measured in simulations of non-relativistic shocks.
In quasi-perpendicular shocks, no non-thermal power-law develops in ions or electrons. The ion
acceleration efficiency in quasi-parallel shocks suggests that astrophysical objects that could
host mildly relativistic quasi-parallel shocks -- for example, the jets of active galactic nuclei
or microquasars -- may be important sources of cosmic rays and their secondaries, such as gamma-rays
and neutrinos.
