Observations of young stellar objects (YSOs) in centimeter bands can probe the continuum emission
from growing dust grains, ionized winds, and magnetospheric activity, which are intimately connected
to the evolution of protoplanetary disks and the formation of planets. We have carried out sensitive
continuum observations toward the Ophiuchus A star-forming region using the Karl G. Jansky Very
Large Array (VLA) at 10 GHz over a field-of-view of 6$'$ with a spatial resolution of $\theta_{maj}$
$\times$ $\theta_{min}$ $\sim$ 0.4$''$ $\times$ 0.2$''$. We achieved a 5 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$
root-mean-square noise level at the center of our mosaic field of view. Among the eighteen sources
we detected, sixteen are YSOs (three Class 0, five Class I, six Class II, and two Class III) and two
are extragalactic candidates. We find that thermal dust emission generally contributes less that
30% of the emission at 10 GHz. The radio emission is dominated by other types of emission such as gyro-synchrotron
radiation from active magnetospheres, free-free emission from thermal jets, free-free emission
from the outflowing photo-evaporated disk material, and/or synchrotron emission from accelerated
cosmic-rays in jet or protostellar surface shocks. These different types of emission could not
be clearly disentangled. Our non-detections towards Class II/III disks suggest that extreme UV-driven
photoevaporation is insufficient to explain the disk dispersal, assuming that the contribution
of UV photoevaporating stellar winds to radio flux does not evolve with time. The sensitivity of
our data cannot exclude photoevaporation due to X-ray photons as an efficient mechanism for disk
dispersal. Deeper surveys with the Square Kilometre Array will be able to provide strong constraints
on disk photoevaporation.
