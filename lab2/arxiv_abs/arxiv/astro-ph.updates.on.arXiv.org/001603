Characterizing the ejecta in young supernova remnants is a requisite step towards a better understanding
of stellar evolution. In Cassiopeia A the density and total mass remaining in the unshocked ejecta
are important parameters for modeling its explosion and subsequent evolution. Low frequency (<100
MHz) radio observations of sufficient angular resolution offer a unique probe of unshocked ejecta
revealed via free-free absorption against the synchrotron emitting shell. We have used the Very
Large Array plus Pie Town Link extension to probe this cool, ionized absorber at 9 arcseconds and
18.5 arcseconds resolution at 74 MHz. Together with higher frequency data we estimate an electron
density of 4.2 electrons per cubic centimeters and a total mass of 0.39 Solar masses with uncertainties
of a factor of about 2. This is a significant improvement over the 100 electrons per cubic centimeter
upper limit offered by infrared [S III] line ratios from the Spitzer Space Telescope. Our estimates
are sensitive to a number of factors including temperature and geometry. However using reasonable
values for each, our unshocked mass estimate agrees with predictions from dynamical models. We
also consider the presence, or absence, of cold iron- and carbon-rich ejecta and how these affect
our calculations. Finally we reconcile the intrinsic absorption from unshocked ejecta with the
turnover in Cas A's integrated spectrum documented decades ago at much lower frequencies. These
and other recent observations below 100 MHz confirm that spatially resolved thermal absorption,
when extended to lower frequencies and higher resolution, will offer a powerful new tool for low
frequency astrophysics.
