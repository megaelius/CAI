We study the dynamical state and properties of galaxies and groups in the supercluster SClA2142
that has a collapsing core, to understand its possible formation and evolution. We find the substructure
of galaxy groups using normal mixture modelling. We have used the projected phase space (PPS) diagram,
spherical collapse model, clustercentric distances, and magnitude gap between the brightest
galaxies in groups to study the dynamical state of groups and to analyse group and galaxy properties.
We compared the alignments of groups and their brightest galaxies with the supercluster axis. The
supercluster core has a radius of about $8 h^{-1}$Mpc and total mass $M_{\mathrm{tot}} \approx
2.3\times~10^{15}h^{-1}M_\odot$ and is collapsing. Galaxies in groups on the supercluster axis
have older stellar populations than off-axis groups, with median stellar ages $4 - 6$ and $< 4$Gyr,
correspondingly. The cluster A2142 and the group Gr8 both host galaxies with the oldest stellar
populations among groups in SClA2142 having the median stellar age $t > 8$Gyr. Recently quenched
galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are mostly located at virial radii or in merging regions
of groups, and at clustercentric distances $D_c \approx 6 h^{-1}$ Mpc. The most elongated groups
lie along the supercluster axis and are aligned with it. Magnitude gaps between the brightest galaxies
of groups are less than one magnitude, suggesting that groups in SClA2142 are dynamically young.
The collapsing core of the supercluster, infall of galaxies and groups, and possible merging groups,
which affect galaxy properties and may trigger the activity of AGNs, show how the whole supercluster
is evolving.
