The inflated transiting hot Jupiter HD 209458b is one of the best studied objects since the beginning
of exoplanet characterization. Transmission observations of this system between the mid infrared
and the far ultraviolet have revealed the signature of atomic, molecular, and possibly aerosol
species in the lower atmosphere of the planet, as well as escaping hydrogen and metals in the upper
atmosphere. From a re-analysis of near-ultraviolet (NUV) transmission observations of HD 209458b,
we detect ionized iron (Fe II) absorption in a 100 A-wide range around 2370 A, lying beyond the planetary
Roche lobe. However, we do not detect absorption of equally strong Fe II lines expected to be around
2600 A. Further, we find no evidence for absorption by neutral magnesium (Mg I), ionized magnesium
(Mg II), nor neutral iron (Fe I). These results avoid the conflict with theoretical models previously
found by Vidal-Madjar et al. (2013), which detected Mg I but did not detect Mg II from this same data
set. Our results indicate that hydrodynamic escape is strong enough to carry atoms as heavy as iron
beyond the planetary Roche lobe, even for planets less irradiated than the extreme ultra-hot-Jupiters
such as WASP-12b and KELT-9b. The detection of iron and non-detection of magnesium in the upper atmosphere
of HD 209458b can be explained by a model in which the lower atmosphere forms (hence, sequesters)
primarily magnesium-bearing condensates, rather than iron condensates. This is suggested by
current microphysical models. The inextricable synergy between upper- and lower-atmosphere
properties highlights the value of combining observations that probe both regions.
