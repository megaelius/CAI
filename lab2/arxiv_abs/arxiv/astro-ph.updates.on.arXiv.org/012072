High-$z$ AGNs hosted in gas rich galaxies are expected to grow through significantly obscured accretion
phases. This may limit or bias their observability. In this work, we use \textsc{BlueTides}, a large
volume cosmological simulation of galaxy formation to examine quasar obscuration for the highest-redshift
($z \geq 7$) supermassive black holes residing in the center of galaxies. We find that for the bright
quasars, most of the high column density gas ($>90\%$) resides in the innermost regions of the host
galaxy, (typically within $< 10$ ckpc), while the gas in the outskirts is a minor contributor to the
$N_\mathrm H$. The brightest quasars can have large angular variations in galactic obscuration,
over 2 orders of magnitude, where the lines of sight with the lowest obscuration are those formed
via strong gas outflows driven by AGN feedback. We find that for the overall AGN population, the mean
$N_\mathrm H$ is generally larger for high luminosity and BH mass, while the $N_\mathrm H$ distribution
is significantly broadened, developing a low $N_\mathrm H $ wing due to the angular variations driven
by the AGN outflows/feedback. The obscured fraction P($N_{\rm H} > 10^{23} {\rm cm}^{-2}$) typically
range from 0.6 to 1.0 for increasing $L_{X}$ (with $L_X > 10^{43} \rm{ergs/s}$), with no clear trend
of redshift evolution. With respect to the galaxy host property, we find a linear relation between
$N_{\rm H}$, $M_*$ and $M_{\rm H_2}$ with $\log N_{\rm H} = (0.24 \pm 0.03) \log M_{*} + (20.7 \pm 0.3)$
and $\log N_{\rm H} = (0.47 \pm 0.03) \log M_{\rm H_2} + (18.4 \pm 0.3)$. The dust optical depth in the
UV band $\tau_{\mathrm UV}$ has tight positive correlation with $N_{\rm H}$. Our dust extincted
UVLF is about 1.5 dex lower than the intrinsic UVLF, implying that more than 99\% of the $z \sim 7$ AGNs
are heavily dust extincted and therefore would be missed by the UV band observation.
