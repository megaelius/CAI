We present a study of the stellar host galaxy, CO (1$-$0) molecular gas distribution and AGN emission
on 50 to 500 pc-scales of the gravitationally lensed dust-obscured AGN MG J0751+2716 and JVAS B1938+666
at redshifts 3.200 and 2.059, respectively. By correcting for the lensing distortion using a grid-based
lens modelling technique, we spatially locate the different emitting regions in the source plane
for the first time. Both AGN host galaxies have 300 to 500 pc-scale size and surface brightness consistent
with a bulge/pseudo-bulge, and 2 kpc-scale AGN radio jets that are embedded in extended molecular
gas reservoirs that are 5 to 20 kpc in size. The CO (1$-$0) velocity fields show structures possibly
associated with discs (elongated velocity gradients) and interacting objects (off-axis velocity
components). There is evidence for a decrement in the CO (1$-$0) surface brightness at the location
of the host galaxy, which may indicate radiative feedback from the AGN, or offset star formation.We
find CO-H$_2$ conversion factors of around $\alpha_{\rm CO} = 1.5\pm0.5$ (K km\,s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$)$^{-1}$,
molecular gas masses of $> 3\times10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$, dynamical masses of $\sim 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$
and gas fractions of around 60 per cent. The intrinsic CO line luminosities are comparable to those
of unobscured AGN and dusty star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts, but the infrared luminosities
are lower, suggesting that the targets are less efficient at forming stars. Therefore, they may
belong to the AGN feedback phase predicted by galaxy formation models, because they are not efficiently
forming stars considering their large amount of molecular gas.
