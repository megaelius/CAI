The radial velocity method is one of the most successful techniques for detecting exoplanets. It
works by detecting the velocity of a host star induced by the gravitational effect of an orbiting
planet, specifically the velocity along our line of sight, which is called the radial velocity of
the star. Low-mass planets typically cause their host star to move with radial velocities of 1 m/s
or less. By analyzing a time series of stellar spectra from a host star, modern astronomical instruments
can in theory detect such planets. However, in practice, intrinsic stellar variability (e.g.,
star spots, convective motion, pulsations) affects the spectra and often mimics a radial velocity
signal. This signal contamination makes it difficult to reliably detect low-mass planets. A principled
approach to recovering planet radial velocity signals in the presence of stellar activity was proposed
by Rajpaul et al. (2015). It uses a multivariate Gaussian process model to jointly capture time series
of the apparent radial velocity and multiple indicators of stellar activity. We build on this work
in two ways: (i) we propose using dimension reduction techniques to construct new high-information
stellar activity indicators; and (ii) we extend the Rajpaul et al. (2015) model to a larger class
of models and use a power-based model comparison procedure to select the best model. Despite significant
interest in exoplanets, previous efforts have not performed large-scale stellar activity model
selection or attempted to evaluate models based on planet detection power. In the case of main sequence
G2V stars, we find that our method substantially improves planet detection power compared to previous
state-of-the-art approaches.
