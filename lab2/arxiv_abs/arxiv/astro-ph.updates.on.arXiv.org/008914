Wind mass transfer in binary systems with AGB donor stars plays a fundamental role in the formation
of a variety of objects, including barium stars and CEMP stars. We carry out a comprehensive set of
SPH simulations of wind-losing AGB stars in binaries, for a variety of binary mass ratios, orbital
separations, initial wind velocities and rotation rates of the donor star. The initial parameters
of the simulated systems are chosen to match the expected progenitors of CEMP stars. We find that
the strength of interaction between the wind and the stars depends on both the wind-velocity-to-orbital-velocity
ratio ($v_\infty/v_\mathrm{orb}$) and the binary mass ratio. Strong interaction occurs for close
systems and comparable mass ratios, and gives rise to a complex morphology of the outflow and substantial
angular-momentum loss, which leads to a shrinking of the orbit. As the orbital separation increases
and the mass of the companion star decreases, the morphology of the outflow, as well as the angular-momentum
loss, become more similar to the spherically symmetric wind case. We also explore the effects of
tidal interaction and find that for orbital separations up to 7-10 AU, depending on mass ratio, spin-orbit
coupling of the donor star occurs at some point during the AGB phase. If the initial wind velocity
is relatively low, we find that corotation of the donor star results in a modified outflow morphology
that resembles wind Roche-lobe overflow. In this case the mass-accretion efficiency and angular-momentum
loss differ from those found for a non-rotating donor. Finally, we provide a relation for both the
mass-accretion efficiency and angular-momentum loss as a function of $v_\infty/v_\mathrm{orb}$
and the binary mass ratio that can be easily implemented in a population synthesis code to study populations
of barium stars, CEMP stars and other products of interaction in AGB binaries.
