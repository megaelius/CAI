Gravitational coupling between young planets and their parent disks is often explored using numerical
simulations, which typically treat the disk thermodynamics in a highly simplified manner. In particular,
many studies adopt the locally isothermal approximation, in which the disk temperature is a fixed
function of the stellocentric distance. We explore the dynamics of planet-driven density waves
in disks with more general thermodynamics, in which the temperature is relaxed towards an equilibrium
profile on a finite cooling timescale $t_{\rm c}$. We use both linear perturbation theory and direct
numerical simulations to examine the global structure of density waves launched by planets in such
disks. A key diagnostic used in this study is the behavior of the wave angular momentum flux (AMF),
which directly determines the evolution of the underlying disk. The AMF of free waves is constant
for slowly cooling (adiabatic) disks, but scales with the disk temperature for rapidly cooling
(and locally isothermal) disks. However, cooling must be extremely fast, with $\beta = \Omega t_{\rm
c} \lesssim 10^{-3}$ for the locally isothermal approximation to provide a good description of
density wave dynamics in the linear regime (relaxing to $\beta \lesssim 10^{-2}$ when nonlinear
effects are important). For intermediate cooling timescales, density waves are subject to a strong
linear damping. This modifies the appearance of planet-driven spiral arms and the characteristics
of axisymmetric structures produced by massive planets: in disks with $\beta \approx 0.1$ -- $1$,
a near-thermal mass planet opens only a single wide gap around its orbit, in contrast to the several
narrow gaps produced when cooling is either faster or slower.
