We present the new TNG50 cosmological, magnetohydrodynamical simulation -- the third and final
volume of the IllustrisTNG project. This simulation occupies a unique combination of large volume
and high resolution, with a 50 Mpc box sampled by 2160^3 gas cells (baryon mass of 8x10^4 Msun). The
median spatial resolution of star-forming ISM gas is ~100-140 parsecs. This resolution approaches
or exceeds that of modern 'zoom' simulations of individual massive galaxies, while the volume contains
~20,000 resolved galaxies with M*>10^7 Msun. Herein we show first results from TNG50, focusing
on galactic outflows driven by supernovae as well as supermassive black hole feedback. We find that
the outflow mass loading is a non-monotonic function of galaxy stellar mass, turning over and rising
rapidly above 10^10.5 Msun due to the action of the central black hole. Outflow velocity increases
with stellar mass, and at fixed mass is faster at higher redshift. The TNG model can produce high velocity,
multi-phase outflows which include cool, dense components. These outflows reach speeds in excess
of 3000 km/s out to 20 kpc with an ejective, BH-driven origin. Critically, we show how the relative
simplicity of model inputs (and scalings) at the injection scale produces complex behavior at galactic
and halo scales. For example, despite isotropic wind launching, outflows exhibit natural collimation
and an emergent bipolarity. Furthermore, galaxies above the star-forming main sequence drive
faster outflows, although this correlation inverts at high mass with the onset of quenching, whereby
low luminosity, slowly accreting, massive black holes drive the strongest outflows.
