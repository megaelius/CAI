We present an explicit detailed theoretical and observational investigation of an anisotropic
massive Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, wherein the extension
is characterized by two additional degrees of freedom; the BD parameter, $\omega$, and the present
day density parameter corresponding to the shear scalar, $\Omega_{\sigma^2,0}$. The BD parameter,
determining the deviation from general relativity (GR), by alone characterizes both the dynamics
of the effective dark energy (DE) and the redshift dependence of the shear scalar. These two affect
each other depending on $\omega$, namely, the shear scalar contributes to the dynamics of the effective
DE, and its anisotropic stress --which does not exist in scalar field models of DE within GR-- controls
the dynamics of the shear scalar deviating from the usual $\propto(1+z)^6$ form in GR. We mainly
confine the current work to non-negative $\omega$ values as it is the right sign --theoretically
and observationally-- for investigating the model as a correction to the $\Lambda$CDM. By considering
the current cosmological observations, we find that $\omega\gtrsim 250$, $\Omega_{\sigma^2,0}\lesssim
10^{-23}$ and the contribution of the anisotropy of the effective DE to this value is insignificant.
We conclude that the simplest anisotropic massive BD gravity extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM
model exhibits no significant deviations from it all the way to the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We
also point out the interesting features of the model in the case of negative $\omega$ values; for
instance, the constraints on $\Omega_{\sigma^2,0}$ could be relaxed considerably, the values
of $\omega\sim-1$ (relevant to string theories) predict dramatically different dynamics for
the expansion anisotropy.
