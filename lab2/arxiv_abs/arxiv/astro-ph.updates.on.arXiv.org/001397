We present in this letter the first analysis of a z~8 galaxy candidate found in the Hubble and Spitzer
imaging data of Abell 2744, as part of the Hubble Frontier Fields legacy program. We applied the most
commonly-used methods to select exceptionally high-z galaxies by combining non-detection and
color-criteria using seven HST bands. We used GALFIT on IRAC images for fitting and subtracting
contamination of bright nearby sources. The physical properties have been inferred from SED-fitting
using templates with and without nebular emission. This letter is focussed on the brightest candidate
we found (m$_{F160W}$=26.2) over the 4.9 arcmin$^2$ field of view covered by the WFC3. It shows a
non-detection in the ACS bands and at 3.6{\mu}m whereas it is clearly detected at 4.5{\mu}m with
rather similar depths. This break in the IRAC data could be explained by strong [OIII]+H{\beta}
lines at z~8 which contribute to the 4.5{\mu}m photometry. The best photo-z is found at z~8.0$^{+0.2}_{-0.5}$,
although solutions at low-redshift (z~1.9) cannot be completely excluded, but they are strongly
disfavoured by the SED-fitting work. The amplification factor is relatively small at {\mu}=1.49$\pm$0.02.
The Star Formation Rate in this object is ranging from 8 to 60 Mo/yr, the stellar mass is in the order
of M$_{\star}$=(2.5-10) x 10$^{9}$Mo and the size is r~0.35$\pm$0.15 kpc. This object is one of
the first z~8 LBG candidates showing a clear break between 3.6{\mu}m and 4.5{\mu}m which is consistent
with the IRAC properties of the first spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at a similar redshift.
Due to its brightness, the redshift of this object could potentially be confirmed by near infrared
spectroscopy with current 8-10m telescopes. The nature of this candidate will be revealed in the
coming months with the arrival of new ACS and Spitzer data, increasing the depth at optical and near-IR
wavelengths.
