In this thesis, we show how the structure of the landscape potential of the primordial Universe may
be probed through the primordial density perturbations responsible for the origin of the cosmic
microwave background anisotropies and the large-scale structure of our Universe. Isocurvature
fields may have fluctuated across the barriers separating local minima of the landscape potential
during inflation. We analyze how this process could have impacted the evolution of the primordial
curvature perturbations. If the typical distance separating consecutive minima of the landscape
potential and the height of the potential barriers are smaller than the Hubble expansion rate parametrizing
inflation, the probability distribution function of isocurvature fields becomes non-Gaussian
due to the appearance of bumps and dips associated with the structure of the potential. We show that
this non-Gaussianity can be transferred to the statistics of primordial curvature perturbations.
The type of non-Gaussian structure that emerges in the distribution of curvature perturbations
cannot be fully probed with the standard methods of polyspectra; instead, the probability distribution
function is needed. To substantiate our claims, we offer a concrete model consisting of an isocurvature
perturbation with a sinusoidal potential and a linear derivative coupling between the isocurvature
and curvature field. This result is generalized to arbitrary potentials and briefly studied beyond
first-order perturbation theory. Finally, we undertake a study of primordial non-Gaussianity
of the local type, where we use our results to reconstruct and constrain the shape of the landscape
potential with the help of Cosmic Microwave Background observations by the Planck telescope and
explore prospects for observable quantities in the Large-Scale Structure of our universe towards
constraining its primordial statistics.
