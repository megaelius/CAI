Radiation mediated shocks (RMS) play a key role in shaping the early emission observed in many transients.
In most cases, e.g., shock breakout in supernovae, llGRBs and neutron star mergers, the upstream
plasma is devoid of radiation, and the photons that ultimately reach the observer are generated
predominantly inside and downstream of the shock. Predicting the observed spectrum requires detailed
calculations of the shock structure and thermodynamic state that account properly for the shock
microphysics. We present results of self-consistent Monte-Carlo simulations of photon-starved
RMS, that yield the shock structure and emission for a broad range of shock velocities, from sub-relativistic
($\beta_{sh} = 0.1$) to highly relativistic ($\Gamma_{sh} = 20$). Our simulations confirm that
in relativistic RMS the immediate downstream temperature is regulated by exponential pair creation,
ranging from $50$ keV at $\beta_{sh}=0.5$ to $200$ keV at $\Gamma_{sh}=20$. At lower velocities
the temperature becomes sensitive to the shock velocity, with $kT\sim 0.5$ keV at $\beta_{sh}=0.1$.
We also confirm that in relativistic shocks the opacity is completely dominated by newly created
pairs, which has important implications for the breakout physics. We find the transition to pair
dominance to occur at $\beta_{sh}=0.5$ roughly. In all cases examined, the spectrum below the $\nu
F_\nu$ peak has been found to be substantially softer than the Planck distribution. This has important
implications for the optical emission in fast and relativistic breakouts, and their detection.
The applications to GRB 060218 and GRB 170817A are discussed.
