In a multi-wavelength survey of $13$ quasars at $5.8\lesssim z\lesssim6.5$, we find five objects
with extremely small proximity zone sizes that may imply UV-luminous lifetimes of $\lesssim 100,000$
years. Proximity zones are regions of enhanced transmitted flux in the vicinity of the quasars that
are sensitive to the quasars' lifetimes because the intergalactic gas has a finite response time
to their radiation. We combine sub-mm observations from the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA)
and the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA), as well as deep optical and near-infrared spectra
from medium-resolution spectrographs on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and on the Keck telescopes,
in order to identify and characterize these new young quasars, which provide valuable clues about
the accretion behavior of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early universe, and pose challenges
on current black hole formation models to explain the rapid formation of billion solar mass black
holes. We measure the quasars' systemic redshifts, black hole masses, Eddington ratios, emission
line luminosities, and star formation rates of their host galaxies. Combined with previous results
we estimate the fraction of young objects within the high-redshift quasar population at large to
be $5\%\lesssim f_{\rm young}\lesssim 9\%$. One of these objects, PSOJ158-14, shows one of the
brightest [$\rm C\,II$] emission lines ($F_{\rm line}=7.18\pm 0.33\,\rm mJy$) observed to date
in high-redshift quasars, and thus indicates a highly star-bursting host galaxy with a star formation
rate of approximately $1200\,M_{\odot}\,\rm yr^{-1}$.
