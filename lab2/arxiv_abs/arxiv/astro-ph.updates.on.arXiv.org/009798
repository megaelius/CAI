ALMA observations of the Serpens South star-forming region suggest that stellar protoclusters
may be completely mass segregated at birth. Independent observations also suggest that embedded
clusters form segregated by mass. As the primordial mass segregation seems to be lost over time,
we aim to study on which timescale an initially perfectly mass-segregated star cluster becomes
indistinguishable from an initially not mass-segregated cluster. As an example, the Orion Nebula
Cluster (ONC) is also discussed. We used $N$-body simulations of star clusters with various masses
and two different degrees of primordial mass segregation. We analysed their energy redistribution
through two-body relaxation to quantify the time when the models agree in terms of mass segregation,
which sets in only dynamically in the models that are primordially not mass segregated. A comprehensive
cross-matched catalogue combining optical, infrared, and X-ray surveys of ONC members was also
compiled and made available. The models evolve to a similar radial distribution of high-mass stars
after the core collapse (about half a median two-body relaxation time, $t_\mathrm{rh}$) and become
observationally indistinguishable from the point of view of mass segregation at time $\tau_\mathrm{v}
\approx 3.3\,t_\mathrm{rh}$. In the case of the ONC, using the distribution of high-mass stars,
we may not rule out either evolutionary scenario (regardless of whether they are initially mass
segregated). When we account for extinction and elongation of the ONC, as reported elsewhere, an
initially perfectly mass-segregated state seems to be more consistent with the observed cluster.
