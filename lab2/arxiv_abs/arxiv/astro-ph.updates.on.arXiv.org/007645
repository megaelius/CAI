We present an overview of the distributions of 11 elemental abundances in the Milky Way's inner regions,
as traced by APOGEE stars released as part of SDSS Data Release 14/15 (DR14/DR15), including O, Mg,
Si, Ca, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Na, Al, and K. This sample spans ~4000 stars with R_GC<4 kpc, enabling the most
comprehensive study to date of these abundances and their variations within the innermost few kiloparsecs
of the Milky Way. We describe the observed abundance patterns ([X/Fe]-[Fe/H]), compare to previous
literature results and to patterns in stars at the solar Galactic radius, and discuss possible trends
with DR14/DR15 effective temperatures. We find that the position of the [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] "knee"
is nearly constant with R_GC, indicating a well-mixed star-forming medium or high levels of radial
migration in the early inner Galaxy. We quantify the linear correlation between pairs of elements
in different subsamples of stars and find that these relationships vary; some abundance correlations
are very similar between the alpha-rich and alpha-poor stars, but others differ significantly,
suggesting variations in the metallicity dependencies of certain supernova yields. These empirical
trends will form the basis for more detailed future explorations and for the refinement of model
comparison metrics. That the inner Milky Way abundances appear dominated by a single chemical evolutionary
track and that they extend to such high metallicities underscore the unique importance of this part
of the Galaxy for constraining the ingredients of chemical evolution modeling and for improving
our understanding of the evolution of the Galaxy as a whole.
