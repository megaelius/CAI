Rotation is one of the key physical mechanisms that deeply impact the evolution of stars. Helio-
and asteroseismology reveal a strong extraction of angular momentum from stellar radiation zones
over the whole Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Turbulent transport in differentially rotating
stably stratified stellar radiation zones should be carefully modeled and its strength evaluated.
Stratification and rotation imply that this turbulent transport is anisotropic. Only phenomenological
prescriptions have been proposed for the transport in the horizontal direction, which however
constitutes a cornerstone in current theoretical formalisms for stellar hydrodynamics in evolution
codes. We derive a new theoretical prescription for the anisotropy of the turbulent transport in
radiation zones using a spectral formalism for turbulence that takes simultaneously stable stratification,
rotation, and a radial shear into account. Then, the horizontal turbulent transport resulting
from 3D turbulent motions sustained by the instability of the radial differential rotation is derived.
We implement this framework in the stellar evolution code STAREVOL and quantify its impact on the
rotational and structural evolution of low-mass stars from the pre-main-sequence to the red giant
branch. The anisotropy of the turbulent transport scales as $N^4\tau^2/\left(2\Omega^2\right)$,
$N$ and $\Omega$ being the buoyancy and rotation frequencies respectively and $\tau$ a time characterizing
the source of turbulence. This leads to a horizontal turbulent transport of similar strength in
average that those obtained with previously proposed prescriptions even if it can be locally larger
below the convective envelope. As a consequence, a complementary transport mechanism like internal
gravity waves or magnetic fields is still needed to explain the observed strong transport of angular
momentum along stellar evolution.
