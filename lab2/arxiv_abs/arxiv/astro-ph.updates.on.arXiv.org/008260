Observations of high-redshift quasars provide information on the massive black holes (MBHs) powering
them and the galaxies hosting them. Current observations of $z \gtrsim 6$ hosts, at submm wavelengths,
trace the properties of cold gas, and these are used to compare with the correlations between MBHs
and galaxies characterizing the $z=0$ population. The relations at $z=0$, however, rely on stellar-based
tracers of the galaxy properties. We perform a very-high resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation
of a $z=7$ quasar including state-of-the-art non-equilibrium chemistry, MBH formation, growth
and feedback, to assess the evolution of the galaxy host and the central MBH, and compare the results
with recent ALMA observations of high-redshift quasars. We measure both the stellar-based quantities
used to establish the $z=0$ correlations, as well as the gas-based quantities available in $z \gtrsim
6$ observations, adopting the same assumptions and techniques used in observational studies.
The high-redshift studies argued that MBHs at high redshift deviate from the local MBH-galaxy correlations.
In our analysis, we find that the high-redshift population sits on the same correlations as the local
one, when using the same tracers used at $z=0$. When using the gas-based tracers, however, we recover
the results of observations that MBHs appear to be over-massive. The discrepancy between local
and high-redshift MBHs seems caused by the different tracers employed, and necessary assumptions,
and not by an intrinsic difference. Better calibration of the tracers, higher resolution data and
availability of facilities that can probe the stellar population will be crucial to assess precisely
and accurately high-redshift quasar hosts.
