Recently, a new form of dark matter has been suggested to naturally reproduce the empirically successful
aspects of Milgrom's law in galaxies. The dark matter particle candidates are axion-like, with
masses of order eV and strong self-interactions. They Bose-Einstein condense into a superfluid
phase in the central regions of galaxy halos. The superfluid phonon excitations in turn couple to
baryons and mediate an additional long-range force. For a suitable choice of the superfluid equation
of state, this force can mimic Milgrom's law. In this paper we develop in detail some of the main phenomenological
consequences of such a formalism, by revisiting the expected dark matter halo profile in the presence
of an extended baryon distribution. In particular, we show how rotation curves of both high and low
surface brightness galaxies can be reproduced, with a slightly rising rotation curve at large radii
in massive high surface brightness galaxies, thus subtly different from Milgrom's law. We finally
point out other expected differences with Milgrom's law, in particular in dwarf spheroidal satellite
galaxies, tidal dwarf galaxies, and globular clusters, whose Milgromian or Newtonian behavior
depends on the position with respect to the superfluid core of the host galaxy. We also expect ultra-diffuse
galaxies within galaxy clusters to have velocities slightly above the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation.
Finally, we note that, in this framework, photons and gravitons follow the same geodesics, and that
galaxy-galaxy lensing, probing larger distances within galaxy halos than rotation curves, should
follow predictions closer to the standard cosmological model than those of Milgrom's law.
