Redshifts have been so easy to measure for so long that we tend to neglect the fact that they too have
uncertainties and are susceptible to systematic error. As we strive to measure cosmological parameters
to better than 1% it is worth reviewing the accuracy of our redshift measurements. Surprisingly
small systematic redshift errors, as low as 0.0001, can have a significant impact on the cosmological
parameters we infer, such as $H_0$. Here we investigate an extensive (but not exhaustive) list of
ways in which redshift estimation can go systematically astray. We review common theoretical errors,
such as adding redshifts instead of multiplying by (1+z); using v=cz; and using only cosmological
redshift in the estimates of luminosity and angular-diameter distances. We consider potential
observational errors, such as rest wavelength precision, air to vacuum conversion at altitude,
and spectrograph wavelength calibration. Finally, we explore physical effects, such as peculiar
velocity corrections, galaxy internal velocities, gravitational redshifts, and overcorrecting
within a bulk flow. We conclude that it would be quite easy for small systematic redshift errors to
have infiltrated our data and be impacting our cosmological results. While it is unlikely that these
errors are large enough to resolve the current $H_0$ tension, it remains possible, and redshift
accuracy may become a limiting factor in near future experiments. With the enormous efforts going
into calibrating the vertical axis of our plots (standard candles, rulers, clocks, and sirens)
we argue that it is now worth paying a little more attention to the horizontal axis (redshifts).
