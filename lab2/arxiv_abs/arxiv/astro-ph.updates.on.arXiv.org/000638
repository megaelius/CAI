Globular clusters display significant variations in their light-element content, pointing to
the existence of a second stellar generation formed from the ejecta of an earlier generation. The
nature of these internal polluters is still a matter of debate: the two most popular scenarios indicate
intermediate-mass AGB stars and fast rotating massive stars. Abundances determination for some
key elements can help distinguish between these competitor candidates. We present in this paper
Y abundances for a sample of 103 red giant branch stars in NGC 6121. Within measurement errors, we
find that the [Y/Fe] is constant in this cluster contrary to a recent suggestion. For a subsample
of six stars we also find [Rb/Fe] to be constant, consistent with previous studies showing no variation
in other s-process elements. We also present a new set of stellar yields for intermediate-mass AGB
stellar models of 5 and 6 solar masses, including heavy element s-process abundances. The uncertainties
on the mass-loss rate, the mixing-length parameter, and the nuclear reaction rates have a major
impact on the stellar abundances. Within the IM-AGB pollution scenario, the constant abundance
of heavy elements inside the cluster requires a marginal s-process efficiency in IM-AGB stars.
Such a constrain could still be satisfied by the present models assuming a stronger mass-loss rate.
The uncertainties mentioned above are limiting the predictive power of intermediate-mass AGB
models. For these reasons, at the moment we are not able to clearly rule out their role as main polluters
of the second population stars in globular clusters.
