We compute the evolution of dust in galaxy clusters by integrating over luminosity functions the
dust abundances obtained via chemical evolution models. We differentiate contributions from
three galactic morphologies: elliptical, spiral, and dwarf irregular. We implement comprehensive
dust evolution models that predict the total amount of dust produced and ejected into the intracluster
medium by galaxies. We then integrate the galactic dust over luminosity functions in order to obtain
the total dust mass in a given cluster. In addition to considering stellar dust production, accretion
and destruction by supernova shocks in the interstellar medium of galaxies, we apply thermal sputtering
to the intracluster dust. The model results are compared to low-to-intermediate redshift dust
observations. Early-type galaxies, which are the most abundant galaxies in clusters, contribute
negligibly to the present-time intracluster dust. On the other hand, we predict that dust masses
-- both the bulk of spatially-unresolved dust and of the dust ejected into the intracluster medium
-- originate from late-type galaxies. We predict a total dust content in galaxy clusters is between
$10^{-6}$ and $10^{-4}$ of the total gas mass, depending on whether the galactic component is excluded
or not. This result is consistent with statistics from higher redshift clusters. Furthermore,
if we allow for Type Ia supernova dust production within early-type galaxies, we find that even in
the extreme dust production case, the contribution to dust from early-type galaxies would still
be a negligible fraction of the intracluster dust mass.
