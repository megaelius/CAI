Fuzzy dark matter of ultra-light axions has gained attention, largely in light of the galactic scale
problems associated with cold dark matter. But the large de Broglie wavelength, believed to possibly
alleviate these problems, also leads to fluctuations that place constraints on ultra-light axions.
We adapt and extend a method, previously devised to describe the effect of gaseous fluctuations
on cold dark matter cusps, in order to determine the effects of such fluctuations on classical test
particles. We first evaluate the effect of fluctuations in a statistically homogeneous medium
of classical particles, then in a similar system of ultra light axions. In the first case, one recovers
the classical two body relaxation time, and associated diffusion coefficients, from white noise
density fluctuations. In the second situation, the fluctuations are not born of discreteness noise
but from the finite de Broglie wavelength; correlation therefore exists over this scale, while
white noise is retained on larger scales. The resulting density power spectra and correlation functions
are compared with those inferred from numerical simulations, and the relaxation time arising from
the related potential fluctuations is evaluated. We then apply our results to estimate the heating
of disks embedded in axion dark haloes. We find that this implies an axion mass $m \ga 2 \times 10^{-22}
{\rm eV}$. We finally apply our model to the case of the central cluster of Eridanus II, confirming
that far stronger constraints on $m$ may in principle be obtained, and discussing the limitations
associated with the assumptions leading to these.
