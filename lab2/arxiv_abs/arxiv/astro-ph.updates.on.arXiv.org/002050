Context. The Vista Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea (VVV) ESO Public Survey is a variability survey
of the Milky Way bulge and an adjacent section of the disk carried out from 2010 on ESO Visible and Infrared
Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA). VVV will eventually deliver a deep near-IR atlas with photometry
and positions in five passbands (ZYJHK_S) and a catalogue of 1-10 million variable point sources
- mostly unknown - which require classifications. Aims. The main goal of the VVV Templates Project,
that we introduce in this work, is to develop and test the machine-learning algorithms for the automated
classification of the VVV light-curves. As VVV is the first massive, multi-epoch survey of stellar
variability in the near-infrared, the template light-curves that are required for training the
classification algorithms are not available. In the first paper of the series we describe the construction
of this comprehensive database of infrared stellar variability. Methods. First we performed a
systematic search in the literature and public data archives, second, we coordinated a worldwide
observational campaign, and third we exploited the VVV variability database itself on (optically)
well-known stars to gather high-quality infrared light-curves of several hundreds of variable
stars. Results. We have now collected a significant (and still increasing) number of infrared template
light-curves. This database will be used as a training-set for the machine-learning algorithms
that will automatically classify the light-curves produced by VVV. The results of such an automated
classification will be covered in forthcoming papers of the series.
