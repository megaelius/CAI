We analyze the Illustris-1 hydrodynamical cosmological simulation to explore the stellar velocity
dispersion of quiescent galaxies as an observational probe of dark matter halo velocity dispersion
and mass. Stellar velocity dispersion is proportional to dark matter halo velocity dispersion
for both central and satellite galaxies. The dark matter halos of central galaxies are in virial
equilibrium and thus the stellar velocity dispersion is also proportional to dark matter halo mass.
This proportionality holds even when a line-of-sight aperture dispersion is calculated in analogy
to observations. In contrast, at a given stellar velocity dispersion, the dark matter halo mass
of satellite galaxies is smaller than virial equilibrium expectations. This deviation from virial
equilibrium probably results from tidal stripping of the outer dark matter halo. Stellar velocity
dispersion appears insensitive to tidal effects and thus reflects the correlation between stellar
velocity dispersion and dark matter halo mass prior to infall. There is a tight relation (<0.2 dex
scatter) between line-of-sight aperture stellar velocity dispersion and dark matter halo mass
suggesting that the dark matter halo mass may be estimated from the measured stellar velocity dispersion
for both central and satellite galaxies. We evaluate the impact of treating all objects as central
galaxies if the relation we derive is applied to a statistical ensemble. A large fraction (>2/3)
of massive quiescent galaxies are central galaxies and systematic uncertainty in the inferred
dark matter halo mass is <0.1 dex thus simplifying application of the simulation results to currently
available observations.
