We investigate the hadron-quark phase transition in cold neutron stars in light of (i) the observed
limits on the maximum-mass of heavy pulsars, (ii) constraints on the tidal properties inferred
from the gravitational waves emitted in binary neutron-star mergers, and (iii) mass and radius
constraints derived from the observation of hot spots on neutron star observed with NICER. Special
attention is directed to the possible presence of $\Delta(1232)$ baryons in neutron star matter.
Our results indicate that this particle could make up a large fraction of the baryons in neutron stars
and thus have a significant effect on the properties of such objects, particularly on their radii.
This is partially caused by the low density appearance of $\Delta$s for a wide range of theoretically
defensible sets of meson-hyperon, SU(3) ESC08 model, and meson-$\Delta$ coupling constants.
The transition of hadronic matter to quark matter, treated in the 2SC+s condensation phase, is found
to occur only in neutron stars very close to the mass peak. Nevertheless, quark matter may still constitute
an appreciable fraction of the stars' total matter if the phase transition is treated as Maxwell-like
(sharp), in which case the neutron stars located beyond the gravitational mass peak would remain
stable against gravitational collapse. In this case, the instability against gravitational collapse
is shifted to a new (terminal) mass different from the maximum-mass of the stellar sequence, giving
rise to stable compact objects with the same gravitational masses as those of the neutron stars on
the traditional branch, but whose radii are smaller by up to 1 km. All models for the equation of state
of our study fall comfortably within the bound established very recently by Annala {\it et al.} (Nature
Physics, 2020)
