The mass, origin and evolutionary stage of the binary system LB-1 has been the subject of intense
debate, following the claim that it hosts an $\sim$70$M_{\odot}$ black hole, in stark contrast
with the expectations for stellar remnants in the Milky Way. We conducted a high-resolution, phase-resolved
spectroscopic study of the near-infrared Paschen lines in this system, using the 3.5-m telescope
at Calar Alto Observatory. We find that Pa$\beta$ and Pa$\gamma$ (after proper subtraction of the
stellar absorption component) are well fitted with a standard double-peaked model, typical of
disk emission. We measured the velocity shifts of the red and blue peaks at 28 orbital phases: the
line center has an orbital motion in perfect antiphase with the stellar motion, and the radial velocity
amplitude ranges from 8 to 13 km/s for different choices of lines and profile modelling. We interpret
this curve as proof that the disk is tracing the orbital motion of the primary, ruling out the circumbinary
disk and the hierarchical triple scenarios. The phase-averaged peak-to-peak half-separation
(proxy for the projected rotational velocity of the outer disk) is $\sim$70 km s$^{-1}$, larger
than the stellar orbital velocity and also inconsistent with a circumbinary disk. From those results,
we infer a primary mass 4--8 times higher than the secondary mass. Moreover, we show that the ratio
of the blue and red peaks (V/R intensity ratio) has a sinusoidal behaviour in phase with the secondary
star, which can be interpreted as the effect of external irradiation by the secondary star on the
outer disk. Finally, we briefly discuss our findings in the context of alternative scenarios recently
proposed for LB-1. Definitive tests between alternative solutions will require further astrometric
data from $Gaia$.
