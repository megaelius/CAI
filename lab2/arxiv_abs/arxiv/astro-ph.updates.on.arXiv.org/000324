Recently a series of indications have been put forward suggesting the presence of two gamma-ray
lines at 110-130 GeV (centered at 111 and 129 GeV). Signals of these lines have been observed toward
the Galactic center, at some galaxy clusters and among some of the unassociated point sources of
the 2 years Fermi catalogue. Such a combination of signals could be generated by dark matter annihilations
in the main dark matter halo, its substructures and nearby galaxy clusters. We discuss here the consistency
between the number of events observed at the line energies in the sky and the predictions using results
from the Via Lactea II numerical simulation and extrapolations below its mass resolution, taking
into account that the annihilation cross-section to the lines can be estimated from the Galactic
center signal. We find that some extrapolations to small substructures can naturally account for
the point sources signal, although the hypothesis of background only cannot be rejected. We also
study the morphology of the gamma-ray sky at the 2 lines energies, testing different Galactic diffuse
background models to account for interstellar medium uncertainties, and different assumptions
on the DM diffuse component profile. We find from template fits that within reasonable diffuse background
uncertainties the presence of a spherical halo component is preferred and that cuspier dark matter
halo profiles are also preferable even from the full sky fit. We finally check the impact of a dark
disk component, suggested by cosmological simulations that include baryons and find that thin
dark disks can not be disfavored, thus possibly accounting for the preferentially closer to the
Galactic disk distribution of the point sources lines signal.
