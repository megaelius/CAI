Transmission spectroscopy is enabling precise measurements of atmospheric H2O abundances for
numerous giant exoplanets. For hot Jupiters, relating H2O abundances to metallicities provides
a powerful probe of their formation conditions. However, metallicity measurements for Neptune-mass
exoplanets are only now becoming viable. Exo-Neptunes are expected to possess super-solar metallicities
from accretion of H2O-rich and solid-rich planetesimals. However, initial investigations into
the exo-Neptune HAT-P-26b suggested a significantly lower metallicity than predicted by the core-accretion
theory of planetary formation and solar system expectations from Uranus and Neptune. Here, we report
an extensive atmospheric retrieval analysis of HAT-P-26b, combining all available observations,
to reveal its composition, temperature structure, and cloud properties. Our analysis reveals
an atmosphere containing 1.5(+2.1)(-0.9)% H2O, an O/H of 18.1(+25.9)(-11.3)x solar, and C/O <
0.33 (to 2$\sigma$). This updated metallicity, the most precise exo-Neptune metallicity reported
to date, suggests a formation history with significant planetesimal accretion, albeit below that
of Uranus and Neptune. We additionally report evidence for metal hydrides at 4.1$\sigma$ confidence.
Potential candidates are identified as TiH (3.6$\sigma$), CrH (2.1$\sigma$), or ScH (1.8$\sigma$).
Maintaining gas-phase metal hydrides at the derived temperature (~560 K) necessitates strong
disequilibrium processes or external replenishment. Finally, we simulate the JWST Guaranteed
Time Observations for HAT-P-26b. Assuming a composition consistent with current observations,
we predict JWST can detect H2O (at 29$\sigma$), CH4 (6.2$\sigma$), CO2 (13$\sigma$), and CO (3.7$\sigma$),
improving metallicity and C/O precision to 0.2 dex and 0.35 dex. Furthermore, NIRISS observations
could detect several metal hydrides at >5$\sigma$ confidence.
