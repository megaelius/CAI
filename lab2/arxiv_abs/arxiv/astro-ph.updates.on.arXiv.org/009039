We present gas and stellar kinematics of a high-resolution zoom-in cosmological chemodynamical
simulation, which fortuitously captures the formation and evolution of a star-forming, barred,
spiral galaxy, from redshift $z\sim3$ to $z\sim2$ at the peak of the cosmic star formation rate.
By identifying star particles during the evolution of the spiral structure, we find that spiral
arms originate from density wave perturbations. The newly-born stellar populations leave the
spiral arms with a timescale $\tau_{\text{spiral}} \approx 193\,\text{Myr}$, irrespective
of redshift. Moreover, the pattern of the spiral arms rotates like a solid body with constant angular
velocity, which is much lower than the angular velocity of the stars on the thin disc. This is the first
time that spiral density waves are identified in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The
spiral pattern becomes fully organised when the gas settles from a thick (with vertical dispersion
$\sigma_{v} >$ 50 km/s) to a thin ($\sigma_{v} \sim 25$ km/s) disc component in less than 1 Gyr. Our
simulated disc galaxy also has a central X-shaped bar, the seed of which formed by the assembly of
dense gas-rich clumps by $z \sim 3$. The galaxy disc grows by accreting gas and substructures from
the environment. The star formation activity in the galaxy mainly happens in the bulge and in several
clumps along the spiral arms at all redshifts, with the clumps increasing in number and size as the
simulation approaches $z=2$. We find that stellar populations with decreasing age are concentrated
towards lower galactic latitudes, being more supported by rotation, and having also lower velocity
dispersion; furthermore, the stellar populations on the thin disc are the youngest and have the
highest average metallicities. The specific angular momentum of the gas steadily increases as
a function of time, at all radii on the thin disc.
