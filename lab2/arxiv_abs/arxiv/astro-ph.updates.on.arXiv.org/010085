We present measurements of cosmic shear two-point correlation functions (TPCFs) from Hyper Suprime-Cam
Subaru Strategic Program (HSC SSP) first-year data, and derived cosmological constraints based
on a blind analysis. The HSC first-year shape catalog is divided into four tomographic redshift
bins ranging from $z=0.3$ to 1.5 with equal widths of $\Delta z =0.3$. The unweighted galaxy number
densities in each tomographic bin are 5.9, 5.9, 4.3, and 2.4 arcmin$^{-2}$ from lower to higher redshifts,
respectively. We adopt the standard TPCF estimators, $\xi_\pm$, for our cosmological analysis,
given that we find no evidence of the significant B-mode shear. The TPCFs are detected at high significance
for all ten combinations of auto- and cross-tomographic bins over a wide angular range, yielding
a total signal-to-noise ratio of 19 in the angular ranges adopted in the cosmological analysis,
$7'<\theta<56'$ for $\xi_+$ and $28'<\theta<178'$ for $\xi_-$. We perform the standard Bayesian
likelihood analysis for cosmological inference from the measured cosmic shear TPCFs, including
contributions from intrinsic alignment of galaxies as well as systematic effects from PSF model
errors, shear calibration uncertainty, and source redshift distribution errors. We adopt a covariance
matrix derived from realistic mock catalogs constructed from full-sky gravitational lensing
simulations that fully account for survey geometry and measurement noise. For a flat $\Lambda$
cold dark matter model, we find $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}=0.804_{-0.029}^{+0.032}$,
and $\Omega_m=0.346_{-0.100}^{+0.052}$. We carefully check the robustness of the cosmological
results against astrophysical modeling uncertainties and systematic uncertainties in measurements,
and find that none of them has a significant impact on the cosmological constraints.
