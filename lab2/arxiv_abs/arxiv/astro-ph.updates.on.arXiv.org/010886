We study the release of various elements from Callisto's surface into its exosphere by plasma sputtering.
The cold Jovian plasma is simulated with a 3D plasma-planetary interaction hybrid model, which
produces 2D surface precipitation maps for magnetospheric H+ , O+ , O++ , and S++ . For the hot Jovian
plasma, we assume isotropic precipitation onto the complete spherical surface. Two scenarios
are investigated: One where no ionospheric shielding takes place and accordingly full plasma penetration
is implemented ('no ionosphere' scenario), and one where an ionosphere lets virtually none of the
cold plasma but all of the hot plasma reach Callisto's surface ('ionosphere' scenario). In the 3D
exosphere model, neutral particles are sputtered from the surface and followed on their individual
trajectories. The 3D density profiles show that whereas in the 'no ionosphere' scenario the ram
direction is favored, the 'ionosphere' scenario produces almost uniform density profiles. In
addition, the density profiles in the 'ionosphere' scenario are reduced by a factor of ~2.5 with
respect to the 'no ionosphere' scenario. We find that the Neutral gas and Ion Mass spectrometer,
which is part of the Particle Environment Package on board the JUICE mission, will be able to detect
the different sputter populations from Callisto's icy surface and the major sputter populations
from Callisto's non-icy surface. The chemical composition of Callisto's exosphere can be directly
linked to the chemical composition of its surface, and will offer us information not only on Callisto's
formation scenario but also on the building blocks of the Jupiter system.
