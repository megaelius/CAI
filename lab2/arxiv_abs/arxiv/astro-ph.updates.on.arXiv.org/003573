Dust is known to be produced in the envelopes of AGB stars, the expanded shells of supernova (SN) remnants,
and in situ grain growth in the ISM, although the corresponding efficiency of each of these dust formation
mechanisms at different redshifts remains a topic of debate. During the first Gyr after the Big Bang,
it is widely believed that there was not enough time to form AGB stars in high numbers, so that the dust
at this epoch is expected to be purely from SNe, or subsequent grain growth in the ISM. The time period
corresponding to z ~5-6 is thus expected to display the transition from SN-only dust to a mixture
of both formation channels as we know it today. Here we aim to use afterglow observations of GRBs at
redshifts larger than $z > 4$ in order to derive host galaxy dust column densities along their line-of-sight
and to test if a SN-type dust extinction curve is required for some of the bursts. GRB afterglow observations
were performed with the 7-channel GROND Detector at the 2.2m MPI telescope in La Silla, Chile and
combined with data gathered with XRT. We increase the number of measured $A_V$ values for GRBs at
z > 4 by a factor of ~2-3 and find that, in contrast to samples at mostly lower redshift, all of the GRB
afterglows have a visual extinction of $A_V$ < 0.5 mag. Analysis of the GROND detection thresholds
and results from a Monte-Carlo simulation show that, although we partly suffer from an observational
bias against highly extinguished sight-lines, GRB host galaxies at 4 < z < 6 seem to contain on average
less dust than at z ~ 2. Additionally, we find that all of the GRBs can be modeled with locally measured
extinction curves and that the SN-like dust extinction curve provides a better fit for only two of
the afterglow SEDs. For the first time we also report a photometric redshift of $z = 7.88$ for GRB 100905A,
making it one of the most distant GRBs known to date.
