Measurements of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, $w$, have been limited by uncertainty
in the selection effects and photometric calibration of $z<0.1$ Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The
Foundation Supernova Survey is designed to lower these uncertainties by creating a new sample of
$z<0.1$ SNe Ia observed on the Pan-STARRS system. Here, we combine the Foundation sample with SNe
from the Pan-STARRS Medium Deep Survey and measure cosmological parameters with 1,338 SNe from
a single telescope and a single, well-calibrated photometric system. For the first time, both the
low-$z$ and high-$z$ data are predominantly discovered by surveys that do not target pre-selected
galaxies, reducing selection bias uncertainties. The $z>0.1$ data include 875 SNe without spectroscopic
classifications and we show that we can robustly marginalize over CC SN contamination. We measure
Foundation Hubble residuals to be fainter than the pre-existing low-$z$ Hubble residuals by $0.046
\pm 0.027$ mag (stat+sys). By combining the SN Ia data with cosmic microwave background constraints,
we find $w=-0.938 \pm 0.053$, consistent with $\Lambda$CDM. With 463 spectroscopically classified
SNe Ia alone, we measure $w=-0.933\pm0.061$. Using the more homogeneous and better-characterized
Foundation sample gives a 55% reduction in the systematic uncertainty attributed to SN Ia sample
selection biases. Although use of just a single photometric system at low and high redshift increases
the impact of photometric calibration uncertainties in this analysis, previous low-$z$ samples
may have correlated calibration uncertainties that were neglected in past studies. The full Foundation
sample will observe up to 800 SNe to anchor the LSST and WFIRST Hubble diagrams.
