Context: The $\beta$ Pictoris moving group is one of the most well-known young associations in the
solar neighbourhood and several members are known to host circumstellar discs, planets, and comets.
Measuring its age with precision is basic to study several astrophysical processes such as planet
formation and disc evolution which are strongly age dependent. Aims: We aim to determine a precise
and accurate dynamical traceback age for the $\beta$ Pictoris moving group. Methods: Our sample
combines the extremely precise Gaia DR2 astrometry with ground-based radial velocities measured
in an homogeneous manner. We use an updated version of our algorithm to determine dynamical ages.
The new approach takes into account a robust estimate of the spatial and kinematic covariance matrices
of the association to improve the sample selection process and to perform the traceback analysis.
Results: We estimate a dynamical age of $18.5_{-2.4}^{+2.0}$ Myr for the $\beta$ Pictoris moving
group. We investigated the spatial substructure of the association at birth time and we propose
the existence of a core of stars more concentrated. We also provide precise radial velocity measurements
for 81 members of $\beta$ Pic, including ten stars with the first determination of their radial velocities.
Conclusions: Our dynamical traceback age is three times more precise than previous traceback age
estimates and, more important, for the first time, reconciles the traceback age with the most recent
estimates of other dynamical, lithium depletion boundary, and isochronal ages. This has been possible
thanks to the excellent astrometric and spectroscopic precisions, the homogeneity of our sample,
and the detailed analysis of binaries and membership.
