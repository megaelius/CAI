Core collapse is a prominent evolutionary stage of self-gravitating systems. In an idealised collisionless
approximation, the region around the cluster core evolves in a self-similar way prior to the core
collapse. Thus, its radial density profile outside the core can be described by a power law, $\rho
\propto r^{-\alpha}$. We aim to find the characteristics of core collapse in $N$-body models. In
such systems, a complete collapse is prevented by transferring the binding energy of the cluster
to binary stars. The contraction is, therefore, more difficult to identify. We developed a method
that identifies the core collapse in $N$-body models of star clusters based on the assumption of
their homologous evolution. We analysed different models (equal- and multi-mass), most of which
exhibit patterns of homologous evolution, yet with significantly different values of $\alpha$:
the equal-mass models have $\alpha \approx 2.3$, which agrees with theoretical expectations,
the multi-mass models have $\alpha \approx 1.5$ (yet with larger uncertainty). Furthermore, most
models usually show sequences of separated homologous collapses with similar properties. Finally,
we investigated a correlation between the time of core collapse and the time of formation of the first
hard binary star. The binding energy of such a binary usually depends on the depth of the collapse
in which it forms, for example from $100\,kT$ to $10^4\,kT$ in the smallest equal-mass to the largest
multi-mass model, respectively. However, not all major hardenings of binaries happened during
the core collapse. In the multi-mass models, we see large transfers of binding energy of $\sim 10^4\,kT$
to binaries that occur on the crossing timescale and outside of the periods of the homologous collapses.
