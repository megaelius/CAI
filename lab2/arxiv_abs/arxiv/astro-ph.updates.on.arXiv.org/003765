We study numerically large-scale magnetic field evolution and its enhancement in gaseous disks
of spiral galaxies. We consider a set of models with the various spiral pattern parameters and the
initial magnetic field strength with taking into account gas self-gravity and cooling/heating.
In agreement with previous studies, we find out that galactic magnetic field is mostly aligned with
gaseous structures, however small-scale gaseous structures (spurs and clumps) are more chaotic
than the magnetic field structure. In spiral arms magnetic field strongly coexists with the gas
distribution, in the inter-arm region we see filamentary magnetic field structure. Simulations
reveal the presence of the small-scale irregularities of the magnetic field as well as the reversal
of magnetic field at the outer edge of the large-scale spurs. We provide evidences that the magnetic
field in the spiral arms has a stronger mean-field component, and there is a clear inverse correlation
between gas density and plasma-beta parameter, compared to the rest of the disk with a more turbulent
component of the field and an absence of correlation between gas density and plasma-beta. We show
the mean field growth up to 3-10$\mu G$ in the cold gas during several rotation periods (500-800 Myr),
whereas ratio between azimuthal and radial field is equal to 4/1. Mean field strength increases
by a factor of 1.5-2.5 for models with various spiral pattern parameters. Random magnetic field
component can reach up to 25 % from the total strength. By making an analysis of the time-depended
evolution of radial Poynting flux we point out that the magnetic field strength is enhanced stronger
at the galactic outskirts which is due to the radial transfer of magnetic energy by the spiral arms
pushing the magnetic field outward. Our results also support the presence of sufficient conditions
for development of MRI at distances >11 kpc.
