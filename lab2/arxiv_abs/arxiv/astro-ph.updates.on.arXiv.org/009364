It is shown that in low-beta, weakly collisional plasmas, such as the solar corona, some instances
of the solar wind, the aurora, inner regions of accretion discs, their coronae, and some laboratory
plasmas, Alfv\'enic fluctuations produce no ion heating within the gyrokinetic approximation,
i.e., as long as their amplitudes (at the Larmor scale) are small and their frequencies stay below
the ion Larmor frequency (even as their spatial scales can be above or below the ion Larmor scale).
Thus, all low-frequency ion heating in such plasmas is due to compressive fluctuations ("slow modes").
Because these fluctuations energetically decouple from the Alfv\'enic ones already in the inertial
range, the above conclusion means that the energy partition between ions and electrons in low-beta
plasmas is decided at the outer scale, where turbulence is launched, and can be determined from magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) models of the relevant astrophysical systems. Any additional ion heating must come from non-gyrokinetic
mechanisms such as cyclotron heating or the stochastic heating owing to distortions of ions' Larmor
orbits. An exception to these conclusions occurs in the Hall limit, i.e., when the ratio of the ion
to electron temperatures is as low as the ion beta (equivalently, the electron beta is order unity).
In this regime, slow modes couple to Alfv\'enic ones well above the Larmor scale (viz., at the ion
inertial or ion sound scale), so the Alfv\'enic and compressive cascades join and then separate
again into two cascades of fluctuations that linearly resemble kinetic Alfv\'en and ion cyclotron
waves, with the former heating electrons and the latter ions. The two cascades are shown to decouple,
scalings for them are derived, and it is argued physically that the two species will be heated by them
at approximately equal rates.
