The environment of supernova remnants (SNRs) is a key factor in their evolution, particularly at
later stages of their existence. It is often assumed that mixed-morphology (MM) SNRs evolve in very
dense environments, and that their centre-filled X-ray morphology is due to interactions between
the SNRs and their surroundings. We aim to determine whether MMSNR VRO 42.05.01 is embedded in, and
interacting with, a dense molecular environment. We used the IRAM telescope in Pico Veleta, Spain,
to search for interaction between the SNR and neighbouring molecular clouds. We observed a region
of $26'\times14'$ towards the west of VRO 42.05.01 and a region of $8'\times4'$ towards the north
of the remnant in the $^{12}$CO $J=1-0$, $^{13}$CO $J=1-0$, and $^{12}$CO $J=2-1$ transitions
with the EMIR receiver. We made maps of the properties of the observed molecular clouds (peak temperatures,
central velocities, velocity dispersions), column density along the line of sight, and ratio of
the $^{12}$CO $J=2-1$ to $^{12}$CO $J=1-0$ transitions. We analyse archival optical, infrared,
and radio spectroscopic data for other hints on the nature of the medium. We do not find conclusive
physical proof that the SNR is interacting with the few, clumpy molecular clouds that surround it
in the region of our observations, although there is some suggestion of such interaction (in a region
outside our map) from infrared emission. There is a velocity gradient in one of the molecular clouds
that is consistent with a stellar wind blown by a $12-14$ $M_{\odot}$ progenitor star. We reassess
the literature distance to VRO 42.05.01, and propose that it has a local standard of rest velocity
of $-6$ km s$^{-1}$, and that it is located $1.0\pm0.4$ kpc away (the earlier distance value was $4.5\pm1.5$
kpc). We find that a dust sheet intersects VRO 42.05.01 and is possibly related to its double shell-shaped
morphology.
