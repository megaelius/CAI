We performed optical and near-infrared multi-band linear polarimetry for highly reddened Type
Ia SN 2014J appeared in M82. SN 2014J exhibits large polarization at shorter wavelengths, reaching
$p\simeq 4.8$\% in $B$ band and steeply decreasing with wavelength, while it has almost constant
position angle $\sim 40^{\circ}$ over the observed wavelength range. No significant temporal
variation is found. Since intrinsic polarization of continuum light from a normal Type Ia supernova
is generally weak ($\lesssim 0.3$\%) and the Galactic interstellar polarization component is
likely negligibly small, the observed polarization is likely predominantly caused by the interstellar
media within M82; however, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that it is caused by circumstellar
media. The wavelength dependence of polarization can be explained by the empirical Serkowski-law
at wavelengths shorter than $1 \mu$m and by an inverse power-law at wavelengths longer than $0.5
\mu$m. The peak polarization wavelength $\lambda_{\rm max}$ is quite short, $\lesssim 0.4\ \mu$m,
suggesting the mean radius of polarizing dust grains is small ($< 0.1 \mu$m). The empirical law
between $K$ and $\lambda_{\rm max}$ for the Galactic interstellar polarization is apparently
broken, although the positive correlation between $R_{V}=A_{V}/E_{B-V}$ and $\lambda_{\rm
max}$ seems to still hold. These facts suggest the nature of the dust grains in M82 is different from
that in our Galaxy. These observed properties are similar to those in the other highly reddened Type
Ia SNe 1986G and 2006X that have ever been polarimetrically observed, and this high probability
suggests that such properties of dust grains are rather common in extragalaxies.
