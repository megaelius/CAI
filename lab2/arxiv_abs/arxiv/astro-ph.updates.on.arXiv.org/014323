Properties of neutron star are investigated by an available relativistic $ab~ initio$ method,
i.e., the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF) model, with the latest high-precision
relativistic charge-dependent potentials, pvCD-Bonn A, B, C. The neutron star matter is solved
within the beta equilibrium and charge neutrality conditions in the framework of RBHF model. Comparing
to the conventional treatment, where the chemical potential of lepton was approximately represented
by the symmetry energy of nuclear matter, the equation of state (EOS) of neutron star matter in the
present self-consistent calculation with pvCD-Bonn B has striking difference above the baryon
number density $n_b=0.55$ fm$^{-3}$. However, these differences influence the global properties
of neutron star only about $1\%\sim2\%$. Then, three two-body potentials pvCD-Bonn A, B, C, with
different tensor components, are systematically applied in RBHF model to calculate the properties
of neutron star. It is found that the maximum masses of neutron star are around $2.21\sim2.30M_\odot$
and the corresponding radii are $R =11.18\sim11.72$ km. The radii of $1.4M_\odot$ neutron star
are predicated as $R_{1.4} = 12.34\sim12.91$ km and their dimensionless tidal deformabilities
are $\Lambda_{1.4} = 485\sim 626$. Furthermore, the direct URCA process in neutron star cooling
will happen from $n_b=0.414\sim0.530$ fm$^{-3}$ with the proton fractions, $Y_p=0.136\sim0.138$.
All of the results obtained from RBHF model only with two-body pvCD-Bonn potentials completely
satisfy various constraints from recent astronomical observations of massive neutron stars,
gravitational wave detection (GW 170817), and mass-radius simultaneous measurement (NICER).
