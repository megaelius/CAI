To generate initial conditions for cosmological $N$-body simulations, one needs to prepare a uniform
distribution of simulation particles, so-called the pre-initial condition (pre-IC). The standard
method to construct the pre-IC is to place the particles on the lattice grids evenly spaced in the
three-dimensional spatial coordinates. However, even after the initial displacement of each
particle according to cosmological perturbations, the particle distribution remains to display
an artificial anisotropy. Such an artifact causes systematic effects in simulations at later time
until the evolved particle distribution sufficiently erases the anisotropy. In this paper, we
study the impacts of the pre-IC on the anisotropic separate universe simulation, where the effect
of large-scale tidal field on structure formation is taken into account using the anisotropic expansion
in a local background (simulation volume). To quantify the impacts, we compare the simulations
employing the standard grid pre-IC and the glass one, where the latter is supposed to suppress the
initial anisotropy. We show that the artificial features in the grid pre-IC simulations are seen
until $z\sim 9$, while the glass pre-IC simulations appear to be stable and accurate over the range
of scales we study. From these results we find that a coupling of the large-scale tidal field with
matter clustering is enhanced compared to the leading-order prediction of perturbation theory
in the quasi non-linear regime in the redshift range $5\lesssim z\lesssim 15$, indicating the importance
of tidal field on structure formation at such high redshifts, e.g. during the epoch of reionization.
