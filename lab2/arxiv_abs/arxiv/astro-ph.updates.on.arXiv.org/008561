We have recently introduced in paper I an extension of the Ruffini-Arg\"uelles-Rueda (RAR) model
for the distribution of DM in galaxies, by including for escape of particle effects. Being built
upon self-gravitating fermions at finite temperatures, the RAR solutions develop a characteristic
\textit{dense quantum core-diluted halo} morphology which, for fermion masses in the range $mc^2
\approx 10-345$ keV, was shown to provide good fits to the Milky Way rotation curve. We study here
for the first time the applicability of the extended RAR model to other structures from dwarfs to
ellipticals to galaxy clusters, pointing out the relevant case of $mc^2 = 48$ keV. By making a full
coverage of the remaining free parameters of the theory, and for each galactic structure, we present
a complete family of astrophysical RAR profiles which satisfy realistic halo boundary conditions
inferred from observations. Each family-set of RAR solutions predicts given windows of total halo
masses and central quantum-core masses, the latter opening the interesting possibility to interpret
them as alternatives either to intermediate-mass BHs (for dwarf galaxies), or to supermassive
BHs (SMBHs, in the case of larger galaxy types). The model is shown to be in good agreement with different
observationally inferred scaling relations such as: (1) the Ferrarese relation connecting DM
halos with supermassive dark central objects; and (2) the nearly constant DM surface density of
galaxies. Finally, the theory provides a natural mechanism for the formation of SMBHs of few $10^8
M_\odot$ via the gravitational collapse of unstable DM quantum-cores.
