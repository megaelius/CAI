The ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 hosts seven Earth-size transiting planets, some of which could
harbour liquid water on their surfaces. UV observations are essential to measure their high-energy
irradiation, and to search for photodissociated water escaping from their putative atmospheres.
Our new observations of TRAPPIST-1 Ly-$\alpha$ line during the transit of TRAPPIST-1c show an evolution
of the star emission over three months, preventing us from assessing the presence of an extended
hydrogen exosphere. Based on the current knowledge of the stellar irradiation, we investigated
the likely history of water loss in the system. Planets b to d might still be in a runaway phase, and
planets within the orbit of TRAPPIST-1g could have lost more than 20 Earth oceans after 8 Gyr of hydrodynamic
escape. However, TRAPPIST-1e to h might have lost less than 3 Earth oceans if hydrodynamic escape
stopped once they entered the habitable zone. We caution that these estimates remain limited by
the large uncertainty on the planet masses. They likely represent upper limits on the actual water
loss because our assumptions maximize the XUV-driven escape, while photodissociation in the upper
atmospheres should be the limiting process. Late-stage outgassing could also have contributed
significant amounts of water for the outer, more massive planets after they entered the habitable
zone. While our results suggest that the outer planets are the best candidates to search for water
with the JWST, they also highlight the need for theoretical studies and complementary observations
in all wavelength domains to determine the nature of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, and their potential
habitability.
