The emission process that powers Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) remains unknown. In this work, we investigate
whether the synchrotron maser emission from relativistic shocks can explain the observed FRB properties.
We perform one dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of perpendicular shocks propagating
in the magnetar wind, assumed to be a cold electron-positron plasma. We confirm that a linearly polarized
X-mode wave is self-consistently generated by the shock and propagates back upstream as a precursor
wave. We investigate how its efficiency and spectrum depend on the flow magnetization $\sigma$
(i.e., the ratio of Poynting flux to particle energy flux of the pre-shock flow), in the regime $\sigma\gtrsim0.1$
relevant for magnetar winds. Our results are checked for consistency among three PIC codes. We find
that at $\sigma\gtrsim 1$ the shock converts a fraction $ f_\xi \approx 2 \times 10^{-3}/\sigma$
of the total incoming energy into the precursor wave, as measured in the post-shock frame (in the
shock frame, the efficiency is $f_\xi' \approx 7 \times 10^{-4}/\sigma^2$). The spectrum of the
precursor wave is narrow-band, $\Delta \omega /\omega_{\rm peak} \lesssim 1-3$, with apparent
but not dominant line-like features as many resonances concurrently contribute. The peak frequency
scales in the post-shock frame as $\omega_{\rm peak} \simeq 3\, \omega_{\rm p}\max[1,\sqrt{\sigma}]$,
where $\omega_{\rm p}$ is the plasma frequency. At $\sigma\gtrsim1$, where our estimated $\omega_{\rm
peak}$ differs from previous works, we find that the shock structure presents two solitons separated
by a cavity, and the peak frequency corresponds to an eigenmode of the cavity. We also find that the
precursor efficiency and spectrum do not depend on the flow Lorentz factor. Our results provide
physically-grounded inputs for FRB emission models within the magnetar scenario.
