Context. A large fraction of transneptunian objects are found in binary pairs, ~30% in the cold classical
population between $a_\text{hel}$~39 and ~48 AU. Observationally, these binaries generally
have components of similar size and colour. Previous work has shown that gravitational collapse
of a pebble cloud is an efficient mechanism for producing such systems. Since the discovery of the
bi-lobate nature of Arrokoth there is also interest in gravitational collapse as a way to form contact
binaries. Aims. Our aim was to investigate formation of binary systems via gravitational collapse,
considering a wider range of binary masses than previous studies. We analysed in detail the properties
of the bound systems that are formed and compared them to observations. Methods. We performed N-body
simulations of gravitational collapse of a pebble cloud using the REBOUND package, with an integrator
designed for rotating reference frames and robust collision detection. We conducted a deep search
for gravitationally bound particles at the end of the gravitational collapse phase and tested their
stability. For all systems produced, not just the most massive binaries, we investigated the population
characteristics of their mass and orbital parameters. Gravitational collapse can create binary
systems analogous to Arrokoth and collisions in a collapsing cloud should be gentle enough to preserve
a bi-lobed structure. Results. Gravitational collapse is an efficient producer of bound planetesimal
systems. On average ~1.5 bound systems were produced per cloud in the mass range studied here. As
well as the large equal-sized binaries, we found that gravitational collapse produces massive
bodies with small satellites and low mass binaries with a high mass ratio. Our results disfavour
the collapse of high mass clouds, in line with reported upper mass limits of clouds formed by the streaming
instability.
