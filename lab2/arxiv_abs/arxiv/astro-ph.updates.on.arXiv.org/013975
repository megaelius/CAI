We continue our investigation into the nonlinear evolution of the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke
(GSF) instability in differentially rotating radiation zones. This instability may be a key player
in transporting angular momentum in stars and giant planets, but its nonlinear evolution remains
mostly unexplored. In a previous paper we considered the equatorial instability, whereas here
we simulate the instability at a general latitude for the first time. We adopt a local Cartesian Boussinesq
model in a modified shearing box for most of our simulations, but we also perform some simulations
with stress-free, impenetrable, radial boundaries. We first revisit the linear instability and
derive some new results, before studying its nonlinear evolution. The instability is found to behave
very differently compared with its behaviour at the equator. In particular, here we observe the
development of strong zonal jets ("layering" in the angular momentum), which can considerably
enhance angular momentum transport, particularly in axisymmetric simulations. The jets are,
in general, tilted with respect to the local gravity by an angle that corresponds initially with
that of the linear modes, but which evolves with time and depends on the strength of the flow. The instability
transports angular momentum much more efficiently (by several orders of magnitude) than it does
at the equator, and we estimate that the GSF instability could contribute to the missing angular
momentum transport required in both red giant and subgiant stars. It could also play a role in the
long-term evolution of the solar tachocline and the atmospheric dynamics of hot Jupiters.
