In the framework of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism, we study the dependence of macroscopic
mixing on the structure of different blue supergiant progenitors and compare the results with observations
of SN 1987A. All of our seven 3D neutrino-driven explosion models, with SN 1987A-like explosion
energies, produce Ni-56 in rough agreement with the amount deduced from fitting the radioactive
tail of the light curve. Among these models only one old model yields a maximum velocity of ~3000 km/s
for the bulk of ejected Ni-56, consistent with observational data. In all of our models hydrogen
is mixed downward to minimum velocities below 400 km/s, which agrees with spectral observations.
Hydrodynamic simulations with the new progenitor models, having smaller radii compared to the
older ones, show a much better agreement of the calculated light curves with the observed one in the
initial luminosity peak and during the first 20 days. The considered presupernova models, 3D explosion
simulations, and light curve calculations can explain the basic observational features of SN 1987A.
A set of models with slightly different explosion energies shows that a high growth factor of Rayleigh-Taylor
instabilities at the (C+O)/He composition interface and a weak interaction of fast Rayleigh-Taylor
plumes with the reverse shock occurring below the He/H composition interface seem to be a sufficient
condition for efficient Ni-56 mixing outwards into the hydrogen envelope. The stellar model yielding
the maximum Ni-56 velocity of ~3000 km/s does not match of the helium-core mass of 6 Msun inferred
from the absolute luminosity of the presupernova star. The lack of an adequate progenitor model
for the well-studied SN 1987A remains a challenge for the theory of the evolution of massive stars.
