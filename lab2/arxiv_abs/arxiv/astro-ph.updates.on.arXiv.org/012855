Strong gravitational lensing along with the distance sum rule method can constrain both cosmological
parameters as well as density profiles of galaxies without assuming any fiducial cosmological
model. To constrain galaxy parameters and cosmic curvature, we use a newly compiled database of
$161$ galactic scale strong lensing systems for distance ratio data. For the luminosity distance
in the distance sum rule method, we use databases of supernovae type-Ia (Pantheon) and Gamma Ray
Bursts (GRBs). We use a general lens model, namely the Extended Power-Law lens model. We consider
three different parametrisations of mass density power-law index $(\gamma)$ to study the dependence
of $\gamma$ on redshift. We find that parametrisations of $\gamma$ have a negligible impact on the
best fit value of cosmic curvature parameter. Furthermore, measurement of time delay can provide
a promising cosmographic probe via the "time delay distance" that includes the ratio of distances
between the observer, lens and the source. We use the distance sum rule method with $12$ datapoints
of time-delay distance data to put constraints on the Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR) and
the cosmic curvature parameter. For this we consider three different parametrisations of distance
duality parameter $(\eta)$. Our results indicate that a flat universe can be accommodated within
$95\%$ confidence level for all the parametrisations of $\eta$. Further, we find that within 95\%
confidence level, there is no violation of CDDR if $\eta$ is assumed to be redshift dependent but
CDDR is violated if $\eta$ is considered redshift independent. Hence, we need a larger sample of
strong gravitational lensing systems in order to improve the constraints on the cosmic curvature
and distance duality parameter.
