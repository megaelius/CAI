In the new era of gravitational wave (GW) and multi-messenger astrophysics, the detection of a GW
signal from the coalescence of a black hole - neutron star (BHNS) binary remains a highly anticipated
discovery. This kind of system is expected to be within reach of the second generation of ground-based
detectors. In this context, we develop a series of versatile semi-analytical models to predict
the properties of all the electromagnetic (EM) counterparts of BHNS mergers. We include the nuclear-decay-powered
kilonova emission, its radio remnant, the prompt emission from the jet and the related afterglow.
The properties of these counterparts depend upon those of the outflows that result from the partial
disruption of the NS during the merger and from the accretion disc around the remnant, which are necessary
ingredients for transient EM emission to accompany the GW signal. We therefore define ways to relate
the properties of these outflows to those of the progenitor binary, establishing a link between
the binary parameters and the counterpart properties. From the resulting model, we anticipate
the variety of light curves that can emerge after a BHNS coalescence, from the radio up to gamma-rays.
These light curves feature universal traits which are the imprint of the dynamics of the emitting
outflows, but at the same time they show a clear dependence on the BH mass and spin, though with a high
degree of degeneracy. The latter can be deduced by joint GW - EM analysis. In this paper, we perform
a proof-of-concept multi-messenger parameter estimation of a BHNS merger with an associated kilonova,
to test how the information from the EM counterpart can complement that from the GW signal. Our results
indicate that the observation and modeling of the kilonova can help to break the degeneracies in
the GW parameter space, leading to better constraints on, e.g., the BH spin.
