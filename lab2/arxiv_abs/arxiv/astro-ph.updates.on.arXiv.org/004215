We present Atacama Large Millimetre/Sub-Millimetre Array (ALMA) observations of IRAS 19132+1035,
a candidate jet-ISM interaction zone near the black hole X-ray binary (BHXB) GRS 1915+105. With
these ALMA observations (combining data from the 12 m array and the Atacama Compact Array), we map
the molecular line emission across the IRAS 19132+1035 region. We detect emission from the $^{12}$CO
[$J=2-1$], $^{13}$CO [$\nu=0$, $J=2-1$], C$^{18}$O [$J=2-1$], ${\rm H}_{2}{\rm CO}$ [$J=3_{0,3}-2_{0,2}$],
${\rm H}_{2}{\rm CO}$ [$J=3_{2,2}-2_{2,1}$], ${\rm H}_{2}{\rm CO}$ [$J=3_{2,1}-2_{2,0}$],
SiO [$\nu=0$, $J=5-4$], CH$_3$OH [$J=4_{2,2}-3_{1,2}$], and CS [$\nu=0$, $J=5-4$] transitions.
Given the morphological, spectral, and kinematic properties of this molecular emission, we present
several lines of evidence that support the presence of a jet-ISM interaction at this site, including
a jet-blown cavity in the molecular gas. This compelling new evidence identifies this site as a jet-ISM
interaction zone, making GRS 1915$+$105 the third Galactic BHXB with at least one conclusive jet-ISM
interaction zone. However, we find that this interaction occurs on much smaller scales than was
postulated by previous work, where the BHXB jet does not appear to be dominantly powering the entire
IRAS 19132+1035 region. Using estimates of the ISM conditions in the region, we utilize the detected
cavity as a calorimeter to estimate the time-averaged power carried in the GRS 1915+105 jets of $(8.4^{+7.7}_{-8.1})\times10^{32}\,{\rm
erg\,s}^{-1}$. Overall, our analysis demonstrates that molecular lines are excellent diagnostic
tools to identify and probe jet-ISM interaction zones near Galactic BHXBs.
