The cosmological lithium problem, that is, the discrepancy between the lithium abundance predicted
by the Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the one observed for the stars of the 'Spite plateau', is one of
the long standing problems of modern astrophysics. Recent hints for a possible solution involve
lithium burning induced by protostellar mass accretion on Spite plateau stars. The purpose of this
paper is to analyze the effect of protostellar accretion on low metallicity low-mass stars with
a focus on PMS lithium evolution. We computed the evolution from the protostar to the MS phase of accreting
models with final masses of 0.7 and 0.8 M$_\odot$, and three metallicities Z=0.0001, Z=0.0010,
and Z=0.0050. The effects of changing the main parameters affecting accreting models, that is the
accretion energy (cold versus hot accretion), the initial seed mass $M_{seed}$ and radius $R_{seed}$,
and the mass accretion rate $\dot{m}$, have been investigated in detail. As for the main stellar
properties and the surface $^7 Li$ abundance, hot accretion models converge to standard non-accreting
ones within 1 Myr, regardless of the actual value of $M_{seed}$, $R_{seed}$, and $\dot{m}$. Also,
cold accretion models with a relatively large $M_{seed}$ ($\gtrsim 10~M_{jup}$) or $R_{seed}$
($\gtrsim 1~R_\odot$) converge to standard non-accreting ones in less than about 10-20~Myr. A
drastically different evolution occurs whenever a cold protostellar accretion process starts
from small values of $M_{seed}$ and $R_{seed}$ ($M_{seed}\sim 1~M_{jup}$, $R_{seed} \lesssim
1~R_\odot$). These models almost entirely skip the standard Hayashi track evolution and deplete
Li before the end of the accretion phase. The exact amount of depletion depends on the actual combination
of the accretion parameters ($\dot{m}$, $M_{seed}$, and $R_{seed}$), achieving in some cases
the complete exhaustion of Li in the whole star.
