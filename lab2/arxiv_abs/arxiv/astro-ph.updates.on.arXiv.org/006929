The ellipsoid of stellar random motions is a fundamental ingredient of galaxy dynamics. Yet it has
long been difficult to constrain this component in disks others than the Milky Way. This article
presents the modeling of the azimuthal-to-radial axis ratio of the velocity ellipsoid of galactic
disks from stellar dispersion maps using integral field spectroscopy data of the CALIFA survey.
The measured azimuthal anisotropy is shown to be not strongly dependent on the assumed vertical-to-radial
dispersion ratio of the ellipsoid. The anisotropy distribution shows a large diversity in the orbital
structure of disk galaxies from tangential to radial stellar orbits. Globally, the orbits are isotropic
in inner disk regions and become more radial as a function of radius, although this picture tends
to depend on galaxy morphology and luminosity. The Milky Way orbital anisotropy profile measured
from the Second Gaia Data Release is consistent with those of CALIFA galaxies. A new correlation
is evidenced, linking the absolute magnitude or stellar mass of the disks to the azimuthal anisotropy.
More luminous disks have more radial orbits and less luminous disks have isotropic and somewhat
tangential orbits. This correlation is consistent with the picture in galaxy evolution in which
orbits become more radial as the mass grows and is redistributed as a function of time. With the help
of circular velocity curves, it is also shown that the epicycle theory fails to reproduce the diversity
of the azimuthal anisotropy of stellar random motions, as it predicts only nearly radial orbits
in the presence of flat curves. The origin of this conflict is yet to be identified. It also questions
the validity of the vertical-to-radial axis ratio of the velocity ellipsoid derived by many studies
in the framework of the epicyclic approximation.
