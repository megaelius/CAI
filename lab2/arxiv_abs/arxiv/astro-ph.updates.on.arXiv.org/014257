High resolution spectra of typical wind diagnostics ([OI] 6300 \r{A} and other forbidden emission
lines) can often be decomposed into multiple components: high-velocity components with blueshifts
up to several 100 km/s are usually attributed to fast jets, while narrow (NLVC) and broad (BLVC) low-velocity
components are believed to trace slower disc winds. Under the assumption that the line-broadening
is dominated by Keplerian rotation, several studies have found that the BLVCs should trace gas launched
between 0.05 and 0.5 au and correlations between the properties of BLVCs and NLVCs have been interpreted
as evidence for the emission tracing an extended MHD wind and not a photoevaporative wind. We calculated
synthetic line profiles obtained from detailed photoionisation calculations of an X-ray photoevaporation
model and a simple MHD wind model and analyzed the emission regions of different diagnostic lines
and the resulting spectral profiles. The photoevaporation model reproduces most of the observed
NLVCs but not the BLVCs or HVCs. The MHD model is able to reproduce all components but produces Keplerian
double peaks at average inclinations that are rarely observed. The combination of MHD and photoevaporative
winds could solve this problem. Our results suggest that the Gaussian decomposition does not allow
for a clear distinction of flux from different wind regions and that the line broadening is often
dominated by the velocity gradient in the outflow rather than by Keplerian rotation. We show that
observed correlations between BLVC and NLVC do not necessarily imply a common origin in an extended
MHD wind.
