Herbig Ae/Be stars are young, pre-main-sequence stars that sample the transition in structure
and evolution between low- and high-mass stars, providing a key test of accretion processes in higher-mass
stars. Few Herbig Ae/Be stars have detected magnetic fields, calling into question whether the
magnetospheric accretion paradigm developed for low-mass stars can be scaled to higher masses.
We present He I 10830 \AA\ line profiles for 64 Herbig Ae/Be stars with a magnetic field measurement
in order to test magnetospheric accretion in the physical regime where its efficacy remains uncertain.
Of the 5 stars with a magnetic field detection, 1 shows redshifted absorption, indicative of infall,
and 2 show blueshifted absorption, tracing mass outflow. The fraction of redshifted and blueshifted
absorption profiles in the non-magnetic Herbig Ae/Be stars is remarkably similar, suggesting
that the stellar magnetic field does not affect gas kinematics traced by He I 10830 \AA. Line profile
morphology does not correlate with the luminosity, rotation rate, mass accretion rate, or disk
inclination. Only the detection of a magnetic field and a nearly face-on disk inclination show a
correlation (albeit for few sources). This provides further evidence for weaker dipoles and more
complex field topologies as stars develop a radiative envelope. The small number of magnetic Herbig
Ae/Be stars has already called into question whether magnetospheric accretion can be scaled to
higher masses; accretion signatures are not substantially different in magnetic Herbig Ae/Be
stars, casting further doubt that they accrete in the same manner as classical T Tauri stars.
