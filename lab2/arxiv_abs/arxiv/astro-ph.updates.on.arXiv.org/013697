$SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ gauge symmetry requires three right-handed neutrinos ($ N _i $), one of
which, $N_1$, can be sufficiently stable to be dark matter. In the early universe, $ W _R $ exchange
with the Standard Model thermal bath keeps the right-handed neutrinos in thermal equilibrium at
high temperatures. $N_1$ can make up all of dark matter if they freeze-out while relativistic and
are mildly diluted by subsequent decays of a long-lived and heavier right-handed neutrino, $N_2$.
We systematically study this parameter space, constraining the symmetry breaking scale of $SU(2)_R$
and the mass of $N_1$ to a triangle in the $(v_R,M_1)$ plane, with $v_R = (10^6 - 3 \times 10^{12})$
GeV and $M_1 = (2\, {\rm keV} - 1 \, {\rm MeV)}$. Much of this triangle can be probed by signals of warm
dark matter, especially if leptogenesis from $N_2$ decay yields the observed baryon asymmetry.
The minimal value of $v_R$ is increased to $10^8 \, {\rm GeV}$ for doublet breaking of $SU(2)_R$,
and further to $10^9 \, {\rm GeV}$ if leptogenesis occurs via $N_2$ decay, while the upper bound on
$M_1$ is reduced to 100 keV. In addition, there is a component of hot $N_1$ dark matter resulting from
the late decay of $N_2 \rightarrow N_1 \ell^+ \ell^-$ that can be probed by future cosmic microwave
background observations. Interestingly, the range of $v_R$ allows both precision gauge coupling
unification and the Higgs Parity understanding of the vanishing of the Standard Model Higgs quartic
at scale $v_R$. Finally, we study freeze-in production of $N_1$ dark matter via the $W_R$ interaction,
which allows a much wider range of $(v_R,M_1)$.
