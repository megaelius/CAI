We derive Bayesian distances for all stars in the RV sample of Gaia DR2, and use the statistical method
of Schoenrich, Binney & Asplund(2012) to validate the distances and test the Gaia parallaxes. In
contrast to other methods, which rely on special sources, our method directly tests the distances
to all stars in our sample. We find clear evidence for a near-linear trend of distance bias f with distance
s, proving a parallax offset delta p. On average, we find delta p = -0.054 mas (parallaxes in Gaia DR2
need to be increased) when accounting for the parallax uncertainty under-estimate in the Gaia set
(delta p = -0.048 mas on the raw parallax errors) with negligible formal error and a systematic uncertainty
of about 0.006 mas. The value is in concordance with results from asteroseismic measurements, but
differs from the much lower bias found on quasar samples. We further use our method to compile a comprehensive
set of quality cuts in colour, apparent magnitude, and astrometric parameters. Last, we find that
for this sample delta p appears to strongly depend on the parallax uncertainty sigma_p (when including
the additional 0.043 mas) with a statistical confidence far in excess of 10\sigma and a proportionality
factor close to 1, though the dependence varies somewhat with sigma_p. Correcting for the sigma_p
dependence also resolves otherwise unexplained correlations of the offset with the number of observation
periods n_{vis} and ecliptic latitude. Every study using Gaia DR2 parallaxes/distances should
investigate the sensitivity of their results on the parallax biases described here and - for fainter
samples - in the DR2 astrometry paper.
