We introduce a new self-consistent model of galaxy evolution and reionization, ASTRAEUS (semi-numerical
rAdiative tranSfer coupling of galaxy formaTion and Reionization in N-body dArk mattEr simUlationS),
which couples a state-of-the-art N-body simulation with the semi-analytical galaxy evolution
DELPHI and the semi-numerical reionization scheme CIFOG. ASTRAEUS includes all the key processes
of galaxy formation and evolution (including accretion, mergers, supernova and radiative feedback)
and follows the time and spatial evolution of the ionized regions in the intergalactic medium (IGM).
Importantly, it explores different radiative feedback models that cover the physically plausible
parameter space, ranging from a weak and delayed to a strong and immediate reduction of gas mass available
for star formation. From our simulation suite that covers the different radiative feedback prescriptions
and ionization topologies, we find that radiative feedback continuously reduces star formation
in galaxies with $M_h<10^{9.5}M_{\odot}$ upon local reionization; larger mass halos are unaffected
even for the strongest and immediate radiative feedback cases during reionization. For this reason,
the ionization topologies of different radiative feedback scenarios differ only on scales smaller
than $1-2$Mpc, and significant deviations are only found when physical parameters (e.g. the escape
fraction of ionizing photons) are altered based on galactic properties. Finally, we find observables
(the ultra-violet luminosity function, stellar mass function, reionization histories and ionization
topologies) are hardly affected by the choice of the used stellar population synthesis models that
either model single stars or binaries.
