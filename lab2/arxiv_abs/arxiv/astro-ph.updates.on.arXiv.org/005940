In order to characterize the early growth of fine-grained dust rims (FGRs) that commonly surround
chondrules, we perform numerical simulations of dust accretion onto chondrule surfaces. We employ
a Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate the collision of dust monomers having radii between 0.5 and 10
$\mu$m with chondrules whose radii are between 500 and 1000 $\mu$m, in 100-$\mu$m increments. The
collisions are driven by Brownian motion and solar nebula turbulence. After each collision, the
colliding particles either stick at the point of contact, roll or bounce. We limit accretion of dust
monomers (and in some cases, dust aggregates) to a small patch of the chondrule surface, for computational
expediency. We model the morphology of the dust rim and the trajectory of the dust particle, which
are not considered in most of the previous works. Radial profiles of FGR porosity show that rims formed
in weak turbulence are more porous (with a porosity of 60-74\%) than rims formed in stronger turbulence
(with a porosity of 52-60\%). The lower end of each range corresponds to large chondrules and the
upper end to small chondrules, meaning that the chondrule size also has an impact on FGR porosity.
The thickness of FGRs depends linearly on chondrule radius, and the slope of this linear dependency
increases with time, and decreases with the turbulence strength. The porosity of FGRs formed by
dust aggregates is $\sim 20\%$ on average greater than that of FGRs formed by single monomers. In
general, the relatively high porosities that we obtain are consistent with those calculated by
previous authors from numerical simulations, as well as with initial FGR porosities inferred from
laboratory measurements of rimmed chondrule samples and rimmed chondrule analogs.
