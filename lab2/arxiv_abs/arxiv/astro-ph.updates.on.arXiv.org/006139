In recent years, there were studies on the omnipresence and structures of filaments in star-forming
regions, and the role of their fragmentation in the process of star formation. However, only a few
studies analysed the evolution of filaments and their distribution with the Galactic disk where
filaments form self-consistently as part of large-scale molecular cloud evolution. In this thesis,
I perform dust radiative transfer calculations to study the effect of inclination on dust observations
of filaments to evaluate whether the variations enable the identification of more filaments within
dust surveys. I address the early evolution of pc-scale filaments that form within individual clouds
and focus on how and when the filaments fragment, and how the fragmentation relates to typically
used observables. For evaluating the equilibrium state of filaments and the nature of their fragmentation
I examine three simulated molecular clouds formed in kpc-scale numerical simulations modelling
a self-gravitating, magnetised, stratified, supernova-driven ISM. The first fragments appear
when the line masses of the simulated filaments lie well below the critical line mass of Ostrikers
isolated hydrostatic equilibrium solution. This indicate that, although the turbulence of the
entire clouds is mostly driven by gravitational contraction, fragmentation does not occur do to
gravitational instability, but is supported by colliding flow motions. I conclude that there is
no single quantity in my analysis that can uniquely trace the inclination and 3D structure of a filament
based on dust observations alone. A simple model of an isolated, isothermal cylinder may not provide
a good approach for fragmentation analysis, independently of the dominant driving source of the
parental cloud.
