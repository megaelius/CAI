The space-based gravitational wave (GW) detector, \emph{evolved Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna} (eLISA) is expected to observe millions of compact Galactic binaries that populate our
Milky Way. GW measurements obtained from the eLISA detector are in many cases complimentary to possible
electro-magnetic (EM) data. In our previous papers, we have shown that the EM data can significantly
enhance our knowledge of the astrophysically relevant GW parameters of the Galactic binaries,
such as the amplitude and inclination. This is possible due to the presence of some strong correlations
between GW parameters that are measurable by both EM and GW observations, for example the inclination
and sky position. In this paper, we quantify the constraints in the physical parameters of the white-dwarf
binaries, i.e. the individual masses, chirp mass and the distance to the source that can be obtained
by combining the full set of EM measurements such as the inclination, radial velocities, distances
and/or individual masses with the GW measurements. We find the following $2-\sigma$ fractional
uncertainties in the parameters of interest. The EM observations of distance constrains the the
chirp mass to $\sim 15-25 %$, whereas EM data of a single-lined spectroscopic binary constrains
the secondary mass and the distance with factors of 2 to $\sim 40 %$. The single-line spectroscopic
data complemented with distance constrains the secondary mass to $\sim 25-30%$. Finally EM data
on double-lined spectroscopic binary constrains the distance to $\sim 30%$. All of these constraints
depend on the inclination and the signal strength of the binary systems. We also find that the EM information
on distance and/or the radial velocity are the most useful in improving the estimate of the secondary
mass,inclination and/or distance.
