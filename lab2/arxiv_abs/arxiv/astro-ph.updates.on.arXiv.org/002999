We study the consistency of the physical properties of galaxies retrieved from SED-fitting as a
function of spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Using a selection of physically
motivated star formation histories, we set up a control sample of mock galaxy spectra representing
observations of the local universe in high-resolution spectroscopy, and in 56 narrow-band and
5 broad-band photometry. We fit the SEDs at these spectral resolutions and compute their corresponding
the stellar mass, the mass- and luminosity-weighted age and metallicity, and the dust extinction.
We study the biases, correlations, and degeneracies affecting the retrieved parameters and explore
the r\^ole of the spectral resolution and the SNR in regulating these degeneracies. We find that
narrow-band photometry and spectroscopy yield similar trends in the physical properties derived,
the former being considerably more precise. Using a galaxy sample from the SDSS, we compare more
realistically the results obtained from high-resolution and narrow-band SEDs (synthesized from
the same SDSS spectra) following the same spectral fitting procedures. We use results from the literature
as a benchmark to our spectroscopic estimates and show that the prior PDFs, commonly adopted in parametric
methods, may introduce biases not accounted for in a Bayesian framework. We conclude that narrow-band
photometry yields the same trend in the age-metallicity relation in the literature, provided it
is affected by the same biases as spectroscopy; albeit the precision achieved with the latter is
generally twice as large as with the narrow-band, at SNR values typical of the different kinds of
data.
