We present optical (g', R_c, and I_c) to near-infrared (J) simultaneous photometric observations
for a primary transit of GJ3470b, the second lowest-mass planet among transiting planets around
nearby M dwarfs, by using the 50-cm MITSuME telescope and the 188-cm telescope both at Okayama Astrophysical
Observatory. From these data, we derive the planetary mass, radius, and density as 14.1 \pm 1.3 M_earth,
4.32^{+0.21}_{-0.10} R_earth, and 0.94 \pm 0.12 g cm^{-3}, respectively, thus confirming the
low density that was reported by Demory et al. based on the Spitzer/IRAC 4.5-micron photometry (0.72^{+0.13}_{-0.12}
g cm^{-3}). Although the planetary radius is about 10% smaller than that reported by Demory et al.,
this difference does not alter their conclusion that the planet possesses a hydrogen-rich envelope
whose mass is approximately 10% of the planetary total mass. On the other hand, we find that the planet-to-star
radius ratio (R_p/R_s) in the J band (0.07577^{+0.00072}_{-0.00075}) is smaller than that in the
I_c (0.0802 \pm 0.0013) and 4.5-micron (0.07806^{+0.00052}_{-0.00054}) bands by 5.9 \pm 2.0 %
and 3.0 \pm 1.2 %, respectively. A plausible explanation for the differences is that the planetary
atmospheric opacity varies with wavelength due to absorptions and/or scattering by atmospheric
molecules. Although the significance of the observed R_p/R_s variations is still low, if confirmed,
this fact would suggest that GJ3470b does not have a thick cloud layer in the atmosphere. This property
would offer a wealth of opportunity for future transmission spectroscopic observations of this
planet to search for certain molecular features without being prevented by clouds.
