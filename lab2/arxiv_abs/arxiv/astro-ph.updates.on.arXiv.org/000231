We present an analysis of the s-process elements Zr, Ba, and La and the r-process element Eu in a sample
of 50 stars in 19 open clusters. Stellar abundances of each element are based on measures of a minimum
of two lines per species via both equivalent width and spectrum synthesis techniques. We investigate
cluster mean neutron-capture abundance trends as a function of cluster age and location in the Milky
Way disk and compare them to results found in other studies in the literature. We find a statistically
significant trend of increasing cluster [Ba/Fe] as a function of decreasing cluster age, in agreement
with recent findings for other open cluster samples, supporting the increased importance of low-mass
asymptotic giant branch stars to the generation of s-process elements. However, the other s-process
elements, [La/Fe] and [Zr/Fe], do not show similar dependences, in contrast to theoretical expectations
and the limited observational data from other studies. Conversely, cluster [Eu/Fe] ratios show
a slight increase with increasing cluster age, although with marginal statistical significance.
Ratios of [s/r]-process abundances, [Ba/Eu] and [La/Eu], however, show more clearly the increasing
efficiency of s-process relative to r-process enrichment in open cluster chemical evolution,
with significant increases among younger clusters. Last, cluster neutron-capture element abundances
appear to be independent of Galactocentric distance. We conclude that a homogeneous analysis of
a larger sample of open clusters is needed to resolve the apparent discrepant conclusions between
different studies regarding s-process element abundance trends with age to better inform models
of galactic chemical evolution.
