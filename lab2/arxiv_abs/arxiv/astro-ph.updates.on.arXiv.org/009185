We present the first systematic study of the radio continuum size evolution of star-forming galaxies
(SFGs) over the redshift range $0.35<z<2.25$. We use the VLA COSMOS 3GHz map (noise $\rm rms=2.3\,\mu
Jy \,beam^{-1}$, $\theta_{\rm beam}=0.75\,\rm arcsec$) to construct a mass-complete sample
of 3184 radio-selected SFGs that reside on and above the main-sequence (MS) of SFGs. We find no clear
dependence between the radio size and stellar mass, $M_{\star}$, of SFGs with $10.5\lesssim\log(M_\star/\rm
M_\odot)\lesssim11.5$. Our analysis suggests that MS galaxies are preferentially extended,
while SFGs above the MS are always compact. The median effective radius of SFGs on (above) the MS of
$R_{\rm eff}=1.5\pm0.2$ ($1.0\pm0.2$) kpc remains nearly constant with cosmic time; a parametrization
of the form $R_{\rm eff}\propto(1+z)^\alpha$ yields a shallow slope of only $\alpha=-0.26\pm0.08\,(0.12\pm0.14)$
for SFGs on (above) the MS. The size of the stellar component of galaxies is larger than the extent
of the radio continuum emission by a factor $\sim$2 (1.3) at $z=0.5\,(2)$, indicating star formation
is enhanced at small radii. The galactic-averaged star formation rate surface density $(\Sigma_{\rm
SFR})$ scales with the distance to the MS, except for a fraction of MS galaxies ($\lesssim10\%$)
that harbor starburst-like $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$. These "hidden" starbursts might have experienced
a compaction phase due to disk instability and/or merger-driven burst of star formation, which
may or may not significantly offset a galaxy from the MS. We thus propose to jointly use $\Sigma_{\rm
SFR}$ and distance to the MS to better identify the galaxy population undergoing a starbursting
phase.
