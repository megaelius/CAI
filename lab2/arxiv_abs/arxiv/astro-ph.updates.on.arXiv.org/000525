Regions of massive star formation offer some of the best and most easily-observed examples of radiation
hydrodynamics. Boundaries where fully-ionized H II regions transition to neutral/molecular
photodissociation regions (PDRs) are of particular interest because marked temperature and density
contrasts across the boundaries lead to evaporative flows and fluid dynamical instabilities that
can evolve into spectacular pillar-like structures. When detached from their parent clouds, pillars
become ionized globules that often harbor one or more young stars. H2 molecules at the interface
between a PDR and an H II region absorb ultraviolet light from massive stars, and the resulting fluoresced
infrared emission lines are an ideal way to trace this boundary independent of obscuring dust. This
paper presents H2 images of four regions of massive star formation that illustrate different types
of PDR boundaries. The Ara OB1 star formation region contains a striking long wall that has several
wavy structures which are present in H2, but the emission is not particularly bright because the
ambient UV fluxes are relatively low. In contrast, the Carina star formation region shows strong
H2 fluorescence both along curved walls and at the edges of spectacular pillars that in some cases
have become detached from their parent clouds. The less-spectacular but more well-known Eagle
Nebula has two regions that have strong fluorescence in addition to its pillars. While somewhat
older than the other regions, Cyg OB2 has the highest number of massive stars of the regions surveyed
and contains many isolated, fluoresced globules that have head-tail morphologies which point
towards the sources of ionizing radiation. These images provide a collection of potential astrophysical
analogs that may relate to ablated interfaces observed in laser experiments of radiation hydrodynamics.
