Global-scale energy flow throughout Earth's magnetosphere (MSP) is catalyzed by processes that
occur at Earth's magnetopause (MP). Magnetic reconnection is one process responsible for solar
wind entry into and global convection within the MSP, and the MP location, orientation, and motion
have an impact on the dynamics. Statistical studies that focus on these and other MP phenomena and
characteristics inherently require MP identification in their event search criteria, a task that
can be automated using machine learning. We introduce a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent
Neural Network model to detect MP crossings and assist studies of energy transfer into the MSP. As
its first application, the LSTM has been implemented into the operational data stream of the Magnetospheric
Multiscale (MMS) mission. MMS focuses on the electron diffusion region of reconnection, where
electron dynamics break magnetic field lines and plasma is energized. MMS employs automated burst
triggers onboard the spacecraft and a Scientist-in-the-Loop (SITL) on the ground to select intervals
likely to contain diffusion regions. Only low-resolution data is available to the SITL, which is
insufficient to resolve electron dynamics. A strategy for the SITL, then, is to select all MP crossings.
Of all 219 SITL selections classified as MP crossings during the first five months of model operations,
the model predicted 166 (76%) of them, and of all 360 model predictions, 257 (71%) were selected by
the SITL. Most predictions that were not classified as MP crossings by the SITL were still MP-like;
the intervals contained mixed magnetosheath and magnetospheric plasmas. The LSTM model and its
predictions are public to ease the burden of arduous event searches involving the MP, including
those for EDRs. For MMS, this helps free up mission operation costs by consolidating manual classification
processes into automated routines.
