The orbital period ratios of neighbouring sub-Neptunes are distributed asymmetrically near first-order
resonances. There are deficits of systems---"troughs'' in the period ratio histogram---just
short of commensurability, and excesses---"peaks''---just wide of it. We reproduce quantitatively
the strongest peak-trough asymmetries, near the 3:2 and 2:1 resonances, using dissipative interactions
between planets and their natal disks. Disk eccentricity damping captures bodies into resonance
and clears the trough, and when combined with disk-driven convergent migration, draws planets
initially wide of commensurability into the peak. The migration implied by the magnitude of the
peak is modest; reductions in orbital period are $\sim$10\%, supporting the view that sub-Neptunes
complete their formation more-or-less in situ. Once captured into resonance, sub-Neptunes of
typical mass $\sim$$5$--$15 M_{\oplus}$ stay captured (contrary to an earlier claim), as they
are immune to the overstability that afflicts lower mass planets. Driving the limited, short-scale
migration is a gas disk whose surface density is fairly constant inside 1 AU and depleted relative
to a solar-composition disk by 3--5 orders of magnitude. Such gas-poor but not gas-empty environments
are quantitatively consistent with sub-Neptune core formation by giant impacts (and not, e.g.,
pebble accretion). While disk-planet interactions at the close of the planet formation era adequately
explain the 3:2 and 2:1 asymmetries at periods $\gtrsim$ $5$--$15$ days, subsequent modification
by stellar tides appears necessary at shorter periods, particularly for the 2:1.
