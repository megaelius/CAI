Proper motion studies of stars in the centre of the Milky Way have been typically limited to the Arches
and Quintuplet clusters and to the central parsec. Here, we present the first results of a large-scale
proper motion study of stars within several tens of parsecs of Sagittarius A* based on our $0.2''$
angular resolution GALACTICNUCLEUS survey (epoch 2015) combined with NICMOS/HST data from the
Paschen-$\alpha$ survey (epoch 2008). This study will be the first extensive proper motion study
of the central $\sim 36' \times 16'$ of the Galaxy, which is not covered adequately by any of the existing
astronomical surveys such as Gaia because of its extreme interstellar extinction ($A_{V} \gtrsim
30$ mag). Proper motions can help us to disentangle the different stellar populations along the
line-of-sight and interpret their properties in combination with multi-wavelength photometry
from GALACTICNUCLEUS and other sources. It also allows us to infer the dynamics and interrelationship
between the different stellar components of the Galactic Centre (GC). In particular, we use proper
motions to detect co-moving groups of stars which can trace low mass or partially dissolved young
clusters in the GC that can hardly be discovered by any other means. Our pilot study in this work is
on a field in the nuclear bulge associated by HII regions that show the presence of young stars. We
detect the first group of co-moving stars coincident with an HII region. Using colour-magnitude
diagrams, we infer that the co-moving stars are consistent with being the post-main sequence stars
with ages of few Myrs. Simulations show that this group of stars is a real group that can indicate the
existence of a dissolving or low to intermediate mass young cluster. A census of these undiscovered
clusters will ultimately help us to constrain star formation at the GC in the past few ten Myrs.
