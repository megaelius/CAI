The TRAPPIST-1 planetary system is an excellent candidate for study of the evolution and habitability
of M-dwarf planets. Transmission spectroscopy observations performed with the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) suggest the innermost five planets do not possess clear hydrogen atmospheres. Here we reassess
these conclusions with recently updated mass constraints and expand the analysis to include limits
on metallicity, cloud top pressure, and the strength of haze scattering. We connect recent laboratory
results of particle size and production rate for exoplanet hazes to a one-dimensional atmospheric
model for TRAPPIST-1 transmission spectra. Doing so, we obtain a physically-based estimate of
haze scattering cross sections. We find haze scattering cross sections on the order of 1e-26 to 1e-19
cm squared are needed in hydrogen-rich atmospheres for TRAPPIST-1 d, e, and f to match the HST data.
For TRAPPIST-1 g, we cannot rule out a clear hydrogen-rich atmosphere. We also modeled the effects
an opaque cloud deck and substantial heavy element content have on the transmission spectra. We
determine that hydrogen-rich atmospheres with high altitude clouds, at pressures of 12mbar and
lower, are consistent with the HST observations for TRAPPIST-1 d and e. For TRAPPIST-1 f and g, we
cannot rule out clear hydrogen-rich cases to high confidence. We demonstrate that metallicities
of at least 60xsolar with tropospheric (0.1 bar) clouds agree with observations. Additionally,
we provide estimates of the precision necessary for future observations to disentangle degeneracies
in cloud top pressure and metallicity. Our results suggest secondary, volatile-rich atmospheres
for the outer TRAPPIST-1 planets d, e, and f.
