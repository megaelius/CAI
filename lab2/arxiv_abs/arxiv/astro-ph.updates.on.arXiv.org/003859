Neutron stars are ideal to probe, not only nuclear physics, but also strong-field gravity. Approximate
universal relations insensitive to the star's internal structure exist among certain observables
and are useful in testing General Relativity, as they project out the uncertainties in the equation
of state. One such set of universal relations between the moment of inertia $(I)$, the tidal Love
number and the quadrupole moment $(Q)$ has been studied both in General Relativity and in modified
theories. In this paper, we study the relations in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, a well-motivated,
parity-violating effective field theory, extending previous work in various ways. First, we study
how projected constraints on the theory using the I-Love relation depend on the measurement accuracy
of $I$ with radio observations and that of the Love number with gravitational-wave observations.
Provided these quantities can be measured with future observations, we find that the latter could
place bounds on dynamical Chern-Simons gravity that are six orders of magnitude stronger than current
bounds. Second, we study the I-Q and Q-Love relations in this theory by constructing slowly-rotating
neutron star solutions to quadratic order in spin. We find that the approximate universality continues
to hold in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, and in fact, it becomes stronger than in General Relativity,
although its existence depends on the normalization of the dimensional coupling constant of the
theory. Finally, we study the variation of the eccentricity of isodensity contours inside a star
and its relation to the degree of universality. We find that, in most cases, the eccentricity variation
is smaller in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity than in General Relativity, providing further support
to the idea that the approximate self-similarity of isodensity contours is responsible for universality.
