The analysis and interpretation of exoplanet spectra from time-series observations remains a
significant challenge to our current understanding of exoplanet atmospheres, due to the complexities
in understanding instrumental systematics. Previous observations of the hot Jupiter WASP-31b
using transmission spectroscopy at low-resolution have presented conflicting results. Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) observations detected a strong potassium feature at high significance (4.2\sigma),
which subsequent ground-based spectro-photometry with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) failed
to reproduce. Here, we present high-resolution observations (R>80,000) of WASP-31b with the UVES
spectrograph, in an effort to resolve this discrepancy. We perform a comprehensive search for potassium
using differential transit light curves, and integration over the planet's radial velocity. Our
observations do not detect K absorption at the level previously reported with HST, consistent with
the VLT observations. We measure a differential light curve depth $\Delta F = 0.00031 \pm 0.00036$
using 40\AA\ bins centred on the planet's K feature, and set an upper limit on the core line depth of
$\Delta F \leq 0.007$ (3\sigma) at a few times the resolution limit ($\approx0.24\AA$). These results
demonstrate that there are still significant limitations to our understanding of instrumental
systematics even with our most stable space-based instrumentation, and that care must be taken
when extracting narrow band signatures from low-resolution data. Confirming exoplanet features
using alternative instruments and methodologies should be a priority, and confronting the limitations
of systematics is essential to our future understanding of exoplanet atmospheres.
