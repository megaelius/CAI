We present initial measurement of silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) for Ultra-Fast Astronomy (UFA)
which will be able to enhance detection of variability of the optical sky in the millisecond and shorter
time scale. In this experiment two different SiPM models S14160-3050HS and S14520-3050VS were
mounted on the 0.7 meter Nazarbayev University Transient Telescope at the Assy-Turgen Astrophysical
Observatory (NUTTelA-TAO) on two consecutive nights. By coupling the 3mm$\times$3mm SiPM onto
NUTTelA-TAO, we obtain 2.2716'$\times$2.2716' viewing solid-angle on one SiPM channel. As a first
test we measured sky background, bright stars and artificial millisecond alternative source.
we compare detected SiPM counts with Gaia satellite G band flux which showed they are in a good linear
agreement. The obtained photon signal is also analysed on millisecond and microsecond time windows.
According to our experiments, dark count of SiPM S14520-3050VS and S14160-3050HS are measured
to be $\sim$130 and $\sim$85 kilo count per second (kcps) while sky background is $\sim$191 and 203
kcps respectively. Also intrinsic crosstalk of both detectors are measured to be 10.34$\%$ and
10.52$\%$ respectively while light sensitivity of them has a lower limit of 14.7 and 15.2 Gaia G-band
magnitude under 200ms of observation per target with $5\sigma$ criterion. For transient events,
we propagated the 10$\mu s$ sensitivity to be 20 photon detected or 6.1 Gaia G-band magnitude. For
even shorter timescale like Sub-Microsecond, the sensitivity is limited by crosstalk to 12 photons
detected. magnitude. For even shorter timescale like Sub-Microsecond, the sensitivity is limited
by crosstalk to 12 photons detected.
