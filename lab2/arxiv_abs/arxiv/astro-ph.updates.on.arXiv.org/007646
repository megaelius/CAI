The rare intermittent pulsars pose some of the most challenging questions surrounding the pulsar
emission mechanism, but typically have relatively minimal low-frequency ($\lesssim$ 300 MHz)
coverage. We present the first low-frequency detection of the intermittent pulsar J1107-5907
with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) at 154 MHz and the simultaneous detection from the recently
upgraded Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (UTMOST) at 835 MHz, as part of an on-going observing
campaign. During a 30-minute simultaneous observation, we detected the pulsar in its bright emission
state for approximately 15 minutes, where 86 and 283 pulses were detected above a signal-to-noise
threshold of 6 with the MWA and UTMOST, respectively. Of the detected pulses, 51 had counterparts
at both frequencies and exhibited steep spectral indices for both the bright main pulse component
and the precursor component. We find that the bright state pulse energy distribution is best parameterised
by a log-normal distribution at both frequencies, contrary to previous results which suggested
a power law distribution. Further low-frequency observations are required in order to explore
in detail aspects such as pulse-to-pulse variability, intensity modulations and to better constrain
the signal propagation effects due to the interstellar medium and intermittency characteristics
at these frequencies. The spectral index, extended profile emission covering a large fraction
of pulse longitude, and the broadband intermittency of PSR J1107-5907 suggests that future low-frequency
pulsar searches, for instance those planned with SKA-Low, will be in an excellent position to find
and investigate new pulsars of this type.
