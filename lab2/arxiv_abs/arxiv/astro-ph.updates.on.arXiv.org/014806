Context. The detection of planets orbiting chemically peculiar stars is very scarcely known in
the literature. Aims. To determine the detailed chemical composition of the remarkable planet
host star KELT-17. This object hosts a hot-Jupiter planet with 1.31 MJup detected by transits, being
one of the more massive and rapidly rotating planet hosts to date. We aimed to derive a complete chemical
pattern for this star, in order to compare it with those of chemically peculiar stars. Methods. We
carried out a detailed abundance determination in the planet host star KELT-17 via spectral synthesis.
Stellar parameters were estimated iteratively by fitting Balmer line profiles and imposing the
Fe ionization balance, using the program SYNTHE together with plane-parallel ATLAS12 model atmospheres.
Specific opacities for an arbitrary composition and microturbulence velocity vmicro were calculated
through the Opacity Sampling (OS) method. The abundances were determined iteratively by fitting
synthetic spectra to metallic lines of 16 different chemical species using the program SYNTHE.
The complete chemical pattern of KELT-17 was compared to the recently published average pattern
of Am stars. We estimated the stellar radius by two methods: a) comparing the synthetic spectral
energy distribution with the available photometric data and the Gaia parallax, and b) using a Bayesian
estimation of stellar parameters using stellar isochrones. Results. We found overabundances
of Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, and Ba, together with subsolar values of Ca and Sc. Notably, the
chemical pattern agrees with those recently published of Am stars, being then KELT-17 the first
exoplanet host whose complete chemical pattern is unambiguously identified with this class. The
stellar radius derived by two different methods agrees to each other and with those previously obtained
in the literature.
