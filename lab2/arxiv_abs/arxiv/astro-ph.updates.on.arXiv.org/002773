(Abridged) A total of three T type candidates (SOri70, SOri73, and SOriJ0538-0213) lying in the
line of sight towards Sigma Orionis were characterized by means of near-infrared photometric,
astrometric, and spectroscopic studies. H-band methane images were collected for all three sources
and an additional sample of 15 field T type dwarfs using LIRIS/WHT. J-band spectra of resolution
of ~500 were obtained for SOriJ0538-0213 with ISAAC/VLT, and JH spectra of resolution of ~50 acquired
with WFC3/HST were employed for the spectroscopic classification of SOri70 and 73. Proper motions
with a typical uncertainty of +/-3 mas/yr and a time interval of ~7-9 yr were derived. Using the LIRIS
observations of the field T dwarfs, we calibrated this imager for T spectral typing via methane photometry.
The three SOri objects were spectroscopically classified as T4.5+/-0.5 (SOri73), T5+/-0.5 (SOriJ0538-0213),
and T7$^{+0.5}_{-1.0}$ (SOri70). The similarity between the observed JH spectra and the methane
colors and the data of field ultra-cool dwarfs of related classifications suggests that SOri70,
73, and SOriJ053804.65-021352.5 do not deviate significantly in surface gravity in relation to
the field. Additionally, the detection of KI at ~1.25 microns in SOriJ0538-0213 points to a high-gravity
atmosphere. Only the K-band reddish nature of SOri70 may be consistent with a low gravity atmosphere.
The proper motions of SOri70 and 73 are measurable and are larger than that of the cluster by >3.5
sigma. The proper motion of SOriJ0538-0213 is consistent with a null displacement. These observations
suggest that none of the three T dwarfs are likely Sigma Orionis members, and that either planetary-mass
objects with masses below ~4 MJup may not exist free-floating in the cluster or they may lie at fainter
near-infrared magnitudes than those of the targets (this is H>20.6 mag), thus remaining unidentified
to date.
