Short timescale flux variations are closely related to the energy release process of magnetic reconnection
during solar flares. Radio light curves at 1, 2, 3.75, 9.4, and 17 GHz of 209 flares observed by the
Nobeyama Radio Polarimeter from 2000 to 2010 are analyzed with a running smooth technique. We find
that the impulsive component (with a variation timescale shorter than 1 second) of 1 GHz emission
of most flares peaks at a few tens of solar flux unit and lasts for about 1 minute and the impulsive component
of 2 GHz emission lasts a shorter period and peaks at a lower flux level, while at the three high frequency
channels the occurrence frequency of flares increases with the decrease of the flux density up to
the noise level of the corresponding background. The gradual components of these emissions, however,
have similar duration and peak flux density distributions. We also derive the power spectrum on
different timescales and a normalized wavelet analysis is used to confirm features on short timescales.
At a time resolution of 0.1 second, more than $\sim$ 60$\%$ of these radio light curves show significant
flux variation on 1 second or shorter time scales. This fraction increases with the decrease of frequency
and reaches $\sim$ 100$\%$ at 1 GHz, implying that short timescale processes are universal in solar
flares. We also study the correlation between the impulsive radio flux densities and soft X-ray
fluxes obtained with the GOES satellites and find that more than 65$\%$ of the flares with an impulsive
component have their impulsive radio emission reach a peak value ahead of the soft X-ray fluxes and
this fraction increases with the radio frequency.
