We report the results from spectroscopic observations of the multiple images of the strongly lensed
Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), iPTF16geu, obtained with ground based telescopes and the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST). From a single epoch of slitless spectroscopy with HST, we can resolve spectra of
individual lensed supernova images for the first time. This allows us to perform an independent
measurement of the time-delay between the two brightest images, $\Delta t = 1.4 \pm 5.0$ days, which
is consistent with the time-delay measured from the light-curves. We also present measurements
of narrow emission and absorption lines characterizing the interstellar medium in the host galaxy
at z=0.4087, as well as in the foreground lensing galaxy at z=0.2163. We detect strong Na ID absorption
in the host galaxy, indicating that iPTF16geu belongs to a subclass of SNe Ia displaying "anomalously"
large Na ID column densities in comparison to the amount of dust extinction derived from their light
curves. For the deflecting galaxy, we refine the measurement of the velocity dispersion, $\sigma
= 129 \pm 4$ km/s, which significantly constrains the lens model. Since the time-delay between the
SN images is negligible, we can use unresolved ground based spectroscopy, boosted by a factor ~70
from lensing magnification, to study the properties of a high-z SN Ia with unprecedented signal-to-noise
ratio. The spectral properties of the supernova, such as pseudo-Equivalent widths of several absorption
features and velocities of the Si II-line indicate that iPTF16geu, besides being lensed, is a normal
SN Ia, indistinguishable from well-studied ones in the local universe, providing support for the
use of SNe Ia in precision cosmology. We do not detect any significant deviations of the SN spectral
energy distribution from microlensing of the SN photosphere by stars and compact objects in the
lensing galaxy.
