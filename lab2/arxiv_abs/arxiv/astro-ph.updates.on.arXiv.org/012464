We explore the isothermal total density profiles of early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the IllustrisTNG
simulation. For the selected 559 ETGs at $z = 0$ with stellar mass $10^{10.7}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}
\leqslant M_{\ast} \leqslant 10^{11.9}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, the total power-law slope has a
mean of $\langle\gamma^{\prime}\rangle = 2.011 \pm 0.007$ and a scatter of $\sigma_{\gamma^{\prime}}
= 0.171$ over the radial range 0.4 to 4 times the stellar half mass radius. Several correlations between
$\gamma^{\prime}$ and galactic properties including stellar mass, effective radius, stellar
surface density, central velocity dispersion, central dark matter fraction and in-situ-formed
stellar mass ratio are compared to observations and other simulations, revealing that IllustrisTNG
reproduces many correlation trends, and in particular, $\gamma^{\prime}$ is almost constant
with redshift below $z = 2$. Through analyzing IllustrisTNG model variations we show that black
hole kinetic winds are crucial to lowering $\gamma^{\prime}$ and matching observed galaxy correlations.
The effects of stellar winds on $\gamma^{\prime}$ are subdominant compared to AGN feedback, and
differ due to the presence of AGN feedback from previous works. The density profiles of the ETG dark
matter halos are well-described by steeper-than-NFW profiles, and they are steeper in the full
physics (FP) run than their counterparts in the dark matter only (DMO) run. Their inner density slopes
anti-correlates (remain constant) with the halo mass in the FP (DMO) run, and anti-correlates with
the halo concentration parameter $c_{200}$ in both types of runs. The dark matter halos of low-mass
ETGs are contracted whereas high-mass ETGs are expanded, suggesting that variations in the total
density profile occur through the different halo responses to baryons.
