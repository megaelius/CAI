We analyze here a wide sample of carbonaceous chondrites from historic falls (e.g. Allende, Cold
Bokkeveld, Kainsaz, Leoville, Murchison, Murray and Orgueil), and from NASA Antarctic collection
in order to get clues on the role of aqueous alteration in promoting the reflectance spectra diversity
evidenced in the most primitive chondrite groups. We particularly focus in the identification
of spectral features and behavior that can be used to remotely identify primitive carbonaceous
asteroids. The selected meteorite specimens are a sample large enough to exemplify how laboratory
reflectance spectra of rare groups of carbonaceous chondrites exhibit distinctive features that
can be used to remotely characterize the spectra of primitive asteroids. Our spectra cover the full
electromagnetic spectrum from 0.2 to 25 microns by using two spectrometers. First one is a UV-NIR
spectrometer that covers the 0.2 to 2 microns window, while the second one is an Attenuated Total
Reflectance IR spectrometer covering the 2 to 25 microns window. In particular, laboratory analyses
in the UV-NIR window allow obtaining absolute reflectance by using standardized measurement procedures.
We obtained reflectance spectra of specimens belonging to the CI, CM, CV, CR, CO, CK, CH, R, and CB
groups of carbonaceous chondrites plus some ungrouped ones, and allows identifying characteristic
features and bands for each class, plus getting clues on the influence of parent body aqueous alteration.
These laboratory spectra can be compared with the remote spectra of asteroids, but the effects of
terrestrial alteration forming (oxy)hydroxides need to be considered.
