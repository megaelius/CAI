Variations in stellar flux can potentially overwhelm the photometric signal of a transiting planet.
Such variability has not previously been well-characterized in the ultraviolet lines used to probe
the inflated atmospheres surrounding hot Jupiters. Therefore, we surveyed 38 F-M stars for intensity
variations in four narrow spectroscopic bands: two enclosing strong lines from species known to
inhabit hot Jupiter atmospheres, CII $\lambda\lambda$1334,1335 and SiIII $\lambda$1206; one
enclosing SiIV $\lambda\lambda$1393,1402; and 36.5 \AA\ of interspersed continuum. For each
star/band combination, we generated 60 s cadence lightcurves from archival HST COS and STIS time-tagged
photon data. Within these lightcurves, we characterized flares and stochastic fluctuations as
separate forms of variability. Flares: We used a cross-correlation approach to detect 116 flares.
These events occur in the time-series an average of once per 2.5 h, over 50% last 4 min or less, and most
produce the strongest response in SiIV. If the flare occurred during a transit measurement integrated
for 60 min, 90/116 would destroy the signal of an Earth, 27/116 Neptune, and 7/116 Jupiter, with the
upward bias in flux ranging from 1-109% of quiescent levels. Fluctuations: Photon noise and underlying
stellar fluctuations produce scatter in the quiescent data. We model the stellar fluctuations
as Gaussian white noise with standard deviation $\sigma_x$. Maximum likelihood values of $\sigma_x$
range from 1-41% for 60 s measurements. These values suggest that many cool stars will only permit
a transit detection to high confidence in ultraviolet resonance lines if the radius of the occulting
disk is $\gtrsim$ 1 R$_J$. However, for some M dwarfs this limit can be as low as several $R_{Earth}$.
