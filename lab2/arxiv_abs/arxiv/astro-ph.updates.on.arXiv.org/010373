Reionization leads to large spatial fluctuations in the intergalactic temperature that can persist
well after its completion. We study the imprints of such fluctuations on the $z\sim5$ Ly$\alpha$
forest flux power spectrum using a set of radiation-hydrodynamic simulations that model different
reionization scenarios. We find that large-scale coherent temperature fluctuations bring $\sim20-60\%$
extra power at $k\sim0.002$ s/km, with the largest enhancements in the models where reionization
is extended or ends the latest. On smaller scales ($k\gtrsim0.1$ s/km), we find that temperature
fluctuations suppress power by $\lesssim10\%$. We find that the shape of the power spectrum is mostly
sensitive to the reionization midpoint rather than temperature fluctuations from reionization's
patchiness. However, for all of our models with reionization midpoints of $z\le 8$ ($z\le 12$) the
shape differences are $\lesssim20\%$ ($\lesssim40\%$) because of a surprisingly well-matched
cancellation between thermal broadening and pressure smoothing that occurs for realistic thermal
histories. We also consider fluctuations in the ultraviolet background, finding their impact
on the power spectrum to be much smaller than temperature fluctuations at $k\gtrsim0.01$ s/km.
Furthermore, we compare our models to power spectrum measurements, finding that none of our models
with reionization midpoints of $z<8$ is strongly preferred over another and that all of our models
with midpoints of $z\geq8$ are excluded at $2.5\sigma$. Future measurements may be able to distinguish
between viable reionization models if they can be performed at lower $k$ or, alternatively, if the
error bars on the high-$k$ power can be reduced by a factor of $1.5$.
