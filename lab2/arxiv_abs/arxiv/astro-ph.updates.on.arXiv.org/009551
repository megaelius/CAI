On 2019 April 25.346 and 26.640 UT the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave (GW) observatories announced
the detection of the first candidate events in Observing Run 3 that contain at least one neutron star
(dubbed S190425z and S190426c). S190425z is a likely binary neutron star (BNS) merger at $d_L=156\pm
41$ Mpc localized to a sky region of about 7460 deg$^2$ (90% confidence), while S190426c is possibly
the first NS-BH merger ever detected, at $d_L=377\pm 100$ Mpc localized to about 1130 deg$^2$. Here
we report our optical follow-up observations for both events using the MMT 6.5-m telescope, as well
as our spectroscopic follow-up of candidate counterparts (which turned out to be unrelated normal
supernovae) with the 4.1-m SOAR telescope. We compare to publicly reported searches, explore the
overall areal coverage and depth, and evaluate those in relation to the optical/NIR kilonova emission
from the BNS merger GW170817, to theoretical kilonova models, and to on-axis and slightly off-axis
short GRB afterglows. We find that for a GW170817-like kilonova, the partial volume covered spans
up to about 40% for S190425z and 60% for S190426c. For an on-axis jet typical of short GRBs, the search
effective volume is larger, but such a configuration is expected in at most a few percent of GW mergers.
We further find that wide-field $\gamma$-ray and X-ray limits rule out luminous on-axis SGRBs,
for a large fraction of the localization regions, although these searches are not sufficiently
deep in the context of the $\gamma$-ray emission from GW170817 or off-axis SGRB afterglows. The
results indicate that at least some optical follow-up searches are sufficiently deep for counterpart
identification to ~300 Mpc, but that localizations better than ~1000 deg$^2$ are likely essential.
