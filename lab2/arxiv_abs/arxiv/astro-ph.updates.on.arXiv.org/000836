Thanks to their large angular dimension and brightness, red giants and supergiants are privileged
targets for optical long-baseline interferometers. Sixteen red giants and supergiants have been
observed with the VLTI/AMBER facility over a two-years period, at medium spectral resolution (R=1500)
in the K band. The limb-darkened angular diameters are derived from fits of stellar atmospheric
models on the visibility and the triple product data. The angular diameters do not show any significant
temporal variation, except for one target: TX Psc, which shows a variation of 4% using visibility
data. For the eight targets previously measured by Long-Baseline Interferometry (LBI) in the same
spectral range, the difference between our diameters and the literature values is less than 5%,
except for TX Psc, which shows a difference of 11%. For the 8 other targets, the present angular diameters
are the first measured from LBI. Angular diameters are then used to determine several fundamental
stellar parameters, and to locate these targets in the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD). Except
for the enigmatic Tc-poor low-mass carbon star W Ori, the location of Tc-rich stars in the HRD matches
remarkably well the thermally-pulsating AGB, as it is predicted by the stellar-evolution models.
For pulsating stars with periods available, we compute the pulsation constant and locate the stars
along the various sequences in the Period -- Luminosity diagram. We confirm the increase in mass
along the pulsation sequences, as predicted by the theory, except for W Ori which, despite being
less massive, appears to have a longer period than T Cet along the first-overtone sequence.
