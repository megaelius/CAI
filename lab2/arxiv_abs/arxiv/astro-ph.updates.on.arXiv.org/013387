We use three semi-analytic models (SAMs) of galaxy formation and evolution, run on the same 1$h^{-1}$Gpc
MultiDark Planck2 cosmological simulation, to investigate the properties of [OII] emission line
galaxies in the redshift range $0.6<z<1.2$. We compare model predictions with different observational
data sets, including DEEP2--Firefly galaxies with absolute magnitudes. We estimate the [OII]
luminosity, L[OII], using simple relations derived both from the models and observations and also
using a public code. This code ideally uses as input instantaneous star formation rates (SFRs),
which are only provided by one of the SAMs under consideration. We use this SAM to study the feasibility
of inferring galaxies' L[OII] for models that only provide average SFRs. We find that the post-processing
computation of L[OII] from average SFRs is accurate for model galaxies with dust attenuated L[OII]$\lesssim10^{42.2}$erg
s$^{-1}$ ($<5\%$ discrepancy). We also explore how to derive the [OII] luminosity from simple relations
using global properties usually output by SAMs. Besides the SFR, the model L[OII] is best correlated
with the observed-frame $u$ and $g$ broad-band magnitudes. These correlations have coefficients
(r-values) above 0.64 and a dispersion that varies with L[OII]. We use these correlations and an
observational one based on SFR and metallicity to derive L[OII]. These relations result in [OII]
luminosity functions and halo occupation distributions with shapes that vary depending on both
the model and the method used. Nevertheless, for all the considered models, the amplitude of the
clustering at scales above 1$h^{-1}$Mpc remains unchanged independently of the method used to
derive L[OII].
