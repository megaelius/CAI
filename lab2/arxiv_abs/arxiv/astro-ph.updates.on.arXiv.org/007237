We present the X-ray spectral and timing analysis of the transient black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-47,
observed with the AstroSat, Chandra and MAXI space missions during its soft X-ray outburst in 2016.
The outburst, from the rising phase until the peak, is neither detected in hard X-rays (15-50 keV)
by the Swift/BAT nor in radio. Such non-detection along with the source behavior in the hardness-intensity
and color-color diagrams obtained using MAXI data confirm that both Chandra and AstroSat observations
were performed during the high soft spectral state. The High Energy Grating (HEG) spectrum from
the Chandra high-energy transmission grating spectrometer (HETGS) shows two strong, moderately
blueshifted absorption lines at 6.705$_{-0.002}^{+0.002}$ keV and 6.974$_{-0.003}^{+0.004}$
keV, which are produced by Fe XXV and Fe XXVI in a low-velocity ionized disk wind. The corresponding
outflow velocity is determined to be 366$\pm$56 km/s. Separate spectral fits of Chandra/HEG, AstroSat/SXT+LAXPC
and Chandra/HEG + AstroSat/SXT+LAXPC data show that the broadband continuum can be well described
with a relativistic disk-blackbody model, with the disk flux fraction of $\sim 0.97$. Based on the
best-fit continuum spectral modeling of Chandra, AstroSat and Chandra+AstroSat joint spectra
and using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations, we constrain the spectral hardening factor
at 1.56$^{+0.14}_{-0.06}$ and the dimensionless black hole spin parameter at 0.92 $\pm$ 0.04 within
the 99.7% confidence interval. Our conclusion of a rapidly-spinning black hole in 4U 1630-47 using
the continuum spectrum method is in agreement with a previous finding applying the reflection spectral
fitting method.
