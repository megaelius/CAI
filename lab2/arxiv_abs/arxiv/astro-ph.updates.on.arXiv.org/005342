When a planet becomes massive enough, it gradually carves a partial gap around its orbit in the protoplanetary
disk. A pressure maximum can be formed outside the gap where solids which are loosely coupled to the
gas, typically in the pebble size range, can be trapped. The minimum planet mass for building such
a trap, the pebble isolation mass, is important for two reasons: it marks the end of planetary growth
by pebble accretion, and the trapped dust forms a ring that may be observed with millimeter observations.
We study the effect of disk turbulence on the pebble isolation mass and find its dependence on the
gas turbulent viscosity, aspect ratio and particles Stokes number. By means of 2D gas hydrodynamical
simulations, we find the minimum planet mass to form a radial pressure maximum beyond the planet's
orbit, which is the necessary condition to trap pebbles. We then carried out 2D gas+dust hydrodynamical
simulations to examine how dust turbulent diffusion impacts particles trapping at the pressure
maximum. We finally provide a semi-analytical calculation of the pebble isolation mass based on
comparing the radial drift velocity of solids and the root mean square turbulent velocity fluctuations
around the pressure maximum. From our results of gas simulations, we provide an expression for the
pebble isolation mass versus disk aspect ratio and turbulent viscosity. Our gas+dust simulations
show that the effective pebble isolation mass can be nearly an order of magnitude larger in high-viscosity
disks because turbulence diffuse particles out of the pressure maximum. This is quantified by our
semi-analytical calculation, which gives an explicit dependence of the pebble isolation mass
with particles Stokes number. We conclude that disk turbulence can significantly alter the pebble
isolation mass, depending on the level of turbulence in regions of planet formation.
