The upgrade of IceTop, the surface array of IceCube, by a hybrid array of scintillation and radio
detectors is motivated by a rich science case. The scintillators will lower the threshold for the
measurement of air showers to about 100 TeV, provide a more efficient veto of air showers for neutrino
measurements, and improve the separation of the electromagnetic and muonic shower components
due to the different responses of scintillators and ice-Cherenkov tanks. Furthermore, the scintillators
will enable the calibration and compensation of the effect of snow accumulation above IceTop. The
radio antennas will provide a calorimetric measurement of the electromagnetic shower component
and a direct sensitivity to the shower maximum. Consequently, the combination of the existing ice-Cherenkov
detectors in the ice and at the surface with the new scintillation and radio detectors at the surface
will enable unprecedented accuracy for event-by-event mass classification in the PeV to EeV range.
This will transform IceCube into the most accurate instrument for high-energy Galactic cosmic
rays in the Southern Hemisphere. Hence, the hybrid array will make an important contribution to
the main science case of IceCube of understanding the origin of cosmic rays. In addition to its cosmic-ray
science goals, the hybrid array provides essential R&D for IceCube-Gen2 which will feature a larger
surface array, sophisticated timing and communication technology, and elevated surface structures.
Moreover, the hybrid array will improve the understanding of the atmospheric background to the
neutrino measurements and opens new scientific opportunities, such as the searches for PeV gamma
rays from the Galactic Center and for mass-dependent anisotropies.
