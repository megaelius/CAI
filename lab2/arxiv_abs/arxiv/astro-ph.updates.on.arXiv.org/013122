All ten LIGO/Virgo binary black hole (BH-BH) coalescences reported from the O1/O2 runs have near
zero effective spins. There are only three potential explanations of this fact. If the BH spin magnitudes
are large then (i) either both BH spin vectors must be nearly in the orbital plane or (ii) the spin angular
momenta of the BHs must be oppositely directed and similar in magnitude. Or, (iii) the BH spin magnitudes
are small. We test the third hypothesis within the framework of the classical isolated binary evolution
scenario of the BH-BH merger formation. We test three models of angular momentum transport in massive
stars: a mildly efficient transport by meridional currents (as employed in the Geneva code), an
efficient transport by the Tayler-Spruit magnetic dynamo (as implemented in the MESA code), and
a very-efficient transport (as proposed by Fuller et al.) to calculate natal BH spins. We allow for
binary evolution to increase the BH spins through accretion and account for the potential spin-up
of stars through tidal interactions. Additionally, we update the calculations of the stellar-origin
BH masses, include revisions to the history of star formation and to the chemical evolution across
cosmic time. We find that we can match simultaneously the observed BH-BH merger rate density, BH
masses, and effective spins. Models with efficient angular momentum transport are favored. The
updated stellar-mass weighted gas-phase metallicity evolution now used in our models appears
to be a key in better reproducing the LIGO/Virgo merger rate estimate. Mass losses during the pair-instability
pulsation supernova phase are likely overestimated if the merger GW170729 hosts a BH more massive
than 50 Msun. We also estimate rate of BH-NS mergers from recent LIGO/Virgo observations. Our updated
models of BH-BH, BH-NS and NS-NS mergers are now publicly available at www.syntheticuniverse.org.
