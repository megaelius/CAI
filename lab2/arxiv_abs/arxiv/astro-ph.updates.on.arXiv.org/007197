Previous investigations have employed more than 100 close observations of Titan by the Cassini
orbiter to elucidate connections between the production and distribution of Titan's vast, organic-rich
chemical inventory and its atmospheric dynamics. However, as Titan transitions into northern
summer, the lack of incoming data from the Cassini orbiter presents a potential barrier to the continued
study of seasonal changes in Titan's atmosphere. In our previous work (Thelen et al., 2018), we demonstrated
that the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is well suited for measurements
of Titan's atmosphere in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere (~100-500 km) through the use of
spatially resolved (beam sizes <1'') flux calibration observations of Titan. Here, we derive vertical
abundance profiles of four of Titan's trace atmospheric species from the same 3 independent spatial
regions across Titan's disk during the same epoch (2012 to 2015): HCN, HC$_3$N, C$_3$H$_4$, and
CH$_3$CN. We find that Titan's minor constituents exhibit large latitudinal variations, with
enhanced abundances at high latitudes compared to equatorial measurements; this includes CH$_3$CN,
which eluded previous detection by Cassini in the stratosphere, and thus spatially resolved abundance
measurements were unattainable. Even over the short 3-year period, vertical profiles and integrated
emission maps of these molecules allow us to observe temporal changes in Titan's atmospheric circulation
during northern spring. Our derived abundance profiles are comparable to contemporary measurements
from Cassini infrared observations, and we find additional evidence for subsidence of enriched
air onto Titan's south pole during this time period. Continued observations of Titan with ALMA beyond
the summer solstice will enable further study of how Titan's atmospheric composition and dynamics
respond to seasonal changes.
