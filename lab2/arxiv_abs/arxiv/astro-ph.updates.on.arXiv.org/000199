Variable gamma-ray emission has been discovered in five Radio-loud Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1)
galaxies by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. This has
clearly demonstrated that these NLSy1 galaxies do have relativistic jets similar to two other cases
of gamma-ray emitting Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), namely blazars and radio galaxies. We present
here our results on the multi-band analysis of two gamma-ray emitting NLSy1 galaxies namely PKS
1502+036 (z = 0.409) and PKS 2004-447 (z = 0.240) using archival data. We generate multi-band long
term light curves of these sources, build their spectral energy distribution (SED) and model them
using an one zone leptonic model. They resemble more to the SEDs of the flat spectrum radio quasar
(FSRQ) class of AGN. We then compare the SEDs of these two sources with two other Fermi detected AGN
along the traditional blazar sequence, namely the BL Lac Mrk 421 (z = 0.03) and the FSRQ 3C 454.3 (z
= 0.86). The SEDs of both PKS 1502+036 and PKS 2004-447 are found to be intermediate to the SEDs of Mrk
421 and 3C 454.3. In the gamma-ray spectral index v/s gamma-ray luminosity plane, both these NLSy1
galaxies occupy a distinct position, wherein, they have luminosity between Mrk 421 and 3C 454.3,
however steep gamma-ray spectra similar to 3C 454.3. Their Compton dominance as well as their X-ray
spectral slope also lie between Mrk 421 and 3C 454.3. We argue that the physical properties of both
PKS 1502+036 and PKS 2004$-$447 are in general similar to blazars and intermediate between FSRQs
and BL Lac objects and these sources thus could fit into the traditional blazar sequence.
