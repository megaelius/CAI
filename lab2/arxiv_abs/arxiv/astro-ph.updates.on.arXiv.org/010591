Recently, a few-degrees extended $\gamma$-ray halo in the direction of Geminga pulsar has been
detected by HAWC, Milagro and Fermi-LAT. These observations can be interpreted with positrons
($e^+$) and electrons ($e^-$) accelerated by Geminga pulsar wind nebula (PWN), released in a Galactic
environment with a low diffusion coefficient ($D_0$), and inverse Compton scattering (ICS) with
the interstellar radiation fields. We inspect here how the morphology of the ICS $\gamma$-ray flux
depends on the energy, the pulsar age and distance, and the strength and extension of the low-diffusion
bubble. In particular we show that $\gamma$-ray experiments with a peak of sensitivity at TeV energies
are the most promising ones to detect ICS halos. We perform a study of the sensitivity of HAWC, HESS
and the future CTA experiment finding that, with pulsar efficiencies, for the conversion of spin-down
luminosity into $e^{\pm}$, of the order of few %, the first two experiments should have already detected
a few tens of ICS halos while the latter will increase the number of detections by a factor of 4. We then
consider a sample of sources associated to PWNe and detected in the HESS Galactic plane survey and
in the second HAWC catalog. We use the information available in these catalogs for the $\gamma$-ray
spatial morphology and flux of these sources to inspect the value of $D_0$ around them and the $e^{\pm}$
injection spectrum. All sources are detected as extended with a $\gamma$-ray emission extended
about $15-80$ pc. Assuming that most of the $e^{\pm}$ accelerated by these sources have been released
in the interstellar medium, the diffusion coefficient is $2-30 \cdot 10^{26}$ cm$^2$/s at 1 TeV,
i.e. two orders of magnitude smaller than the value considered to be the average in the Galaxy. These
observations imply that Galactic PWNe have low-diffusion bubbles with a size of at least 80 pc.
