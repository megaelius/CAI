Unveiling the evolution of toroidal field instability, known as Tayler instability, is essential
to understand the strength and topology of the magnetic fields observed in early-type stars, in
the core of the red giants, or in any stellar radiative zone. We want to study the non-linear evolution
of the instability of a toroidal field stored in a stably stratified layer, in spherical symmetry
and in the absence of rotation. In particular, we intend to quantify the suppression of the instability
as a function of the Brunt-V\"ais\"ala ($\omega_{\rm BV}$) and the Alfv\'en ($\omega_{\rm A}$)
frequencies. We use the MHD equations as implemented in the anelastic approximation in the EULAG-MHD
code and perform a large series of numerical simulations of the instability exploring the parameter
space for the $\omega_{\rm BV}$ and $\omega_{\rm A}$. We show that beyond a critical value gravity
strongly suppress the instability, in agreement with the linear analysis. The intensity of the
initial field also plays an important role: weaker fields show much slower growth rates. Moreover,
in the case of very low gravity, the fastest growing modes have a large characteristic radial scale,
at variance with the case of strong gravity, where the instability is characterized by horizontal
displacements. Our results illustrate that the anelastic approximation can efficiently describe
the evolution of toroidal field instability in stellar interiors. The suppression of the instability
as a consequence of increasing values of $\omega_{\rm BV}$ might play a role to explain the magnetic
desert in Ap/Bp stars since weak fields are only marginally unstable in the case of strong gravity.
