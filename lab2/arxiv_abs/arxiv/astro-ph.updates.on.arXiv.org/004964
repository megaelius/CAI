In this paper we investigate whether the stellar initial mass function of early-type galaxies depends
on their host environment. To this purpose, we have selected a sample of early-type galaxies from
the SPIDER catalogue, characterized their environment through the group catalogue of Wang et al.
and used their optical SDSS spectra to constrain the IMF slope, through the analysis of IMF-sensitive
spectral indices. To reach a high enough signal-to-noise ratio, we have stacked spectra in velocity
dispersion ($\sigma_0$) bins, on top of separating the sample by galaxy hierarchy and host halo
mass, as proxies for galaxy environment. In order to constrain the IMF, we have compared observed
line strengths to predictions of MIUSCAT/EMILES synthetic stellar population models, with varying
age, metallicity, and "bimodal" (low-mass tapered) IMF slope ($\rm \Gamma_b$). Consistent with
previous studies, we find that $\rm \Gamma_b$ increases with $\sigma_0$, becoming bottom-heavy
(i.e. an excess of low-mass stars with respect to the Milky-Way-like IMF) at high $\sigma_0$. We
find that this result is robust against the set of isochrones used in the stellar population models,
as well as the way the effect of elemental abundance ratios is taken into account. We thus conclude
that it is possible to use currently state-of-the-art stellar population models and intermediate
resolution spectra to consistently probe IMF variations. For the first time, we show that there
is no dependence of $\Gamma_b$ on environment or galaxy hierarchy, as measured within the $3"$ SDSS
fibre, thus leaving the IMF as an intrinsic galaxy property, possibly set already at high redshift.
