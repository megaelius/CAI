The presence of ubiquitous magnetic fields in the universe is suggested from observations of radiation
and cosmic ray from galaxies or the intergalactic medium (IGM). One possible origin of cosmic magnetic
fields is the magnetogenesis in the primordial universe. Such magnetic fields are called primordial
magnetic fields (PMFs), and are considered to affect the evolution of matter density fluctuations
and the thermal history of the IGM gas. Hence the information of PMFs is expected to be imprinted on
the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) through the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
(tSZ) effect in the IGM. In this study, given an initial power spectrum of PMFs as $P(k)\propto B_{\rm
1Mpc}^2 k^{n_{B}}$, we calculate dynamical and thermal evolutions of the IGM under the influence
of PMFs, and compute the resultant angular power spectrum of the Compton $y$-parameter on the sky.
As a result, we find that two physical processes driven by PMFs dominantly determine the power spectrum
of the Compton $y$-parameter; (i) the heating due to the ambipolar diffusion effectively works
to increase the temperature and the ionization fraction, and (ii) the Lorentz force drastically
enhances the density contrast just after the recombination epoch. These facts result in making
the tSZ angular power spectrum induced by the PMFs more remarkable at $\ell >10^4$ than that by galaxy
clusters even with $B_{\rm 1Mpc}=0.1$ nG and $n_{B}=-1.0$ because the contribution from galaxy
clusters decreases with increasing $\ell$. The measurement of the tSZ angular power spectrum on
high $\ell$ modes can provide the stringent constraint on PMFs.
