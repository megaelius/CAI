The intergalactic medium (IGM) is the dominant reservoir of baryons, delineates the large scale
structure at low to moderate overdensities, and provides gas from which galaxies form and evolve.
Simulations of a Cold Dark Matter (CDM) dominated universe predict that the IGM is distributed in
a cosmic web of filaments, and that galaxies should form along and at the intersections of these filaments
(Bond et al. 1994; Miralda-Escude et al. 1996). While observations of QSO absorption lines and the
large scale distribution of galaxies have confirmed the CDM paradigm, the cosmic web has never been
confirmed by direct imaging. Here we report the Lyman-alpha blob 2 (LAB2) in SSA22, with the Cosmic
Web Imager. This is an integral field spectrograph optimized for low surface brightness, extended
emission. With 22 hours of total source exposure, CWI has revealed that LAB2 has extended Lyman-alpha
emission which is consistent with filaments. We perform tests to secure the robustness of this result,
which relies on data with modest signal-to-noise ratio. We have developed a smoothing algorithm
that permits visualization of data cube slices along image or spectral-image planes. With both
raw and smoothed data cubes we demonstrate that the filaments are kinematically associated with
LAB2 and display double-peaked profiles of optically thick Lyman-alpha emission. The flux is 10
to 20x brighter than expected for the emission from the IGM but is consistent with boosted fluorescence
from a buried QSO or gravitation cooling radiation. Using emission models we infer a baryon mass
in the filaments of at least 1-4x10e11 Solar Mass, and the dark halo mass is at least 2x10e12 Solar
Mass. The spatial kinematic morphology is more consistent with inflow from the cosmic web than outflow.
LAB2 and the surrounding gas have significant and coaligned angular momentum, strengthening the
case for their association.
