We apply four statistical learning methods to a sample of $7941$ galaxies ($z<0.06$) from the Galaxy
and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey to test the feasibility of using automated algorithms to classify
galaxies. Using $10$ features measured for each galaxy (sizes, colours, shape parameters \& stellar
mass) we apply the techniques of Support Vector Machines (SVM), Classification Trees (CT), Classification
Trees with Random Forest (CTRF) and Neural Networks (NN), returning True Prediction Ratios (TPRs)
of $75.8\%$, $69.0\%$, $76.2\%$ and $76.0\%$ respectively. Those occasions whereby all four algorithms
agree with each other yet disagree with the visual classification (`unanimous disagreement')
serves as a potential indicator of human error in classification, occurring in $\sim9\%$ of ellipticals,
$\sim9\%$ of Little Blue Spheroids, $\sim14\%$ of early-type spirals, $\sim21\%$ of intermediate-type
spirals and $\sim4\%$ of late-type spirals \& irregulars. We observe that the choice of parameters
rather than that of algorithms is more crucial in determining classification accuracy. Due to its
simplicity in formulation and implementation, we recommend the CTRF algorithm for classifying
future galaxy datasets. Adopting the CTRF algorithm, the TPRs of the 5 galaxy types are : E, $70.1\%$;
LBS, $75.6\%$; S0-Sa, $63.6\%$; Sab-Scd, $56.4\%$ and Sd-Irr, $88.9\%$. Further, we train a binary
classifier using this CTRF algorithm that divides galaxies into spheroid-dominated (E, LBS \&
S0-Sa) and disk-dominated (Sab-Scd \& Sd-Irr), achieving an overall accuracy of $89.8\%$. This
translates into an accuracy of $84.9\%$ for spheroid-dominated systems and $92.5\%$ for disk-dominated
systems.
