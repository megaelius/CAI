Context. The Gaia ESA mission will estimate the astrometric and physical data of more than one billion
objects, providing the largest and most precise catalog of absolute astrometry in the history of
Astronomy. The core of this process, the so-called global sphere reconstruction, is represented
by the reduction of a subset of these objects which will be used to define the celestial reference
frame. As the Hipparcos mission showed, and as is inherent to all kinds of absolute measurements,
possible errors in the data reduction can hardly be identified from the catalog, thus potentially
introducing systematic errors in all derived work. Aims. Following up on the lessons learned from
Hipparcos, our aim is thus to develop an independent sphere reconstruction method that contributes
to guarantee the quality of the astrometric results without fully reproducing the main processing
chain. Methods. Indeed, given the unfeasibility of a complete replica of the data reduction pipeline,
an astrometric verification unit (AVU) was instituted by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis
Consortium (DPAC). One of its jobs is to implement and operate an independent global sphere reconstruction
(GSR), parallel to the baseline one (AGIS, namely Astrometric Global Iterative Solution) but limited
to the primary stars and for validation purposes, to compare the two results, and to report on any
significant differences. Results. Tests performed on simulated data show that GSR is able to reproduce
at the sub-$\mu$as level the results of the AGIS demonstration run presented in Lindegren et al.
(2012). Conclusions. Further development is ongoing to improve on the treatment of real data and
on the software modules that compare the AGIS and GSR solutions to identify possible discrepancies
above the tolerance level set by the accuracy of the Gaia catalog.
