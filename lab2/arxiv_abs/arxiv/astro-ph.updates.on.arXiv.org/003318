The astronomical community continues to be interested in suitable programmable slit masks for
use in multi-object spectrometers (MOSs) on space missions. There have been ground-based MOS utilizing
digital micromirror devices (DMDs) and they have proven to be highly accurate and reliable instruments.
This paper summarizes the results of a continuing study to investigate the performance of DMDs under
conditions associated with space deployment. This includes the response of DMDs to radiation,
to the vibration and mechanical shock loads associated with launch, and the operability of DMD under
cryogenic temperatures. The optical contrast ratio and a study of the long-term reflectance of
a bare device have also been investigated. The results of the radiation testing demonstrate that
DMDs in orbit would experience negligible heavy-ion induced single event upset (SEU) rate burden,
we predict SEU rate of 5.6 micromirrors per 24 hours. Vibration and mechanical shock testing was
performed according to the NASA General Environmental Verification Standard (GEVS), no mirrors
failed in the devices tested. The results of low temperature testing suggest that DMDs are not affected
by the thermal load and operate smoothly at temperatures at least as low as 78 K. The reflectivity
of a bare DMD did not measurably change even after being exposed to ambient conditions over a period
of 13 months. The measured contrast ratio (on state vs off state of the DMD micromirrors) was greater
than 6000/:1 when illuminated with an f/4 optical beam. Overall, DMDs are extremely robust and promise
to provide a reliable alternative to micro shutter arrays (MSA) to be used in space as remotely programmable
slit masks for MOS design.
