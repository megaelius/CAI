We study the mass fallback rate of tidal disruption of a star on marginally bound and unbound orbits
by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) by performing a three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamic
simulations with three key parameters: the star is modeled by a polytrope with two different indexes
($n=1.5$ and $3$). The stellar orbital properties are characterized by five various orbital eccentricities
ranging from $e=0.98$ to $1.02$ and five different penetration factors ranging from $\beta=1$
to $3$, where $\beta$ represents the ratio of the tidal disruption to pericenter distance radii.
We analytically derive the formulae of the differential mass distributions and corresponding
mass fallback rates by taking account of the three key parameters. Moreover, two critical eccentricities
($e_{\rm crit,1}$ and $e_{\rm crit,2}$) to classify tidal disruption events (TDEs) into five different
types by the stellar orbit are reevaluated based on the assumption that the spread in debris energy
is proportional to $\beta^k$, where $k$ is presumed to range for $0<k<2$. We confirm by our simulations
that it ranges for $0<k\lesssim2$. We find that the peak of mass fallback rates is higher and its slope
is steeper in the early time as the penetration factor increases for all TDE types. When the stars
on marginally bound orbits with $e_{\rm crit,1}\lesssim{e}<1$ are tidally disrupted, the peak
of mass fallback rates can be about one order of magnitude larger than that of parabolic TDE ($e=1$)
case. For marginally hyperbolic TDEs ($1<e\lesssim{e}_{\rm crit,2}$), the mass fallback rates
can be much lower than the Eddington accretion rate, which can lead to the formation of a radiatively
inefficient accretion flow, while stars on hyperbolic orbits with $e\gtrsim{e_{\rm crit,2}}$
lead to a failed TDE. Marginally unbound TDEs could be an origin of a very low density gas disk around
a dormant SMBH.
