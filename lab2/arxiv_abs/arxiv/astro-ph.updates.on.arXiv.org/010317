Dwarf galaxy satellite systems are essential probes to test models of structure formation, making
it necessary to establish a census of dwarf galaxies outside of our own Local Group. We present deep
FORS2 VI band images from the ESO Very Large Telescope for 15 dwarf galaxy candidates in the Centaurus
group of galaxies. We confirm nine dwarfs to be members of CenA by measuring their distances using
a Bayesian approach to determine the tip of the red giant branch luminosity. We have also fitted theoretical
isochrones to measure their mean metallicities. The properties of the new dwarfs are similar to
those in the Local Group in terms of their sizes, luminosities, and mean metallicities. Within our
photometric precision there is no evidence of a metallicity spread, but we do observe possible extended
star formation in several galaxies, as evidenced by a population of asymptotic giant branch stars
brighter than the red giant branch tip. The new dwarfs do not show any signs of tidal disruption. Together
with the recently reported dwarf galaxies by the complementary PISCeS survey, we study the luminosity
function and 3D structure of the group. By comparing the observed luminosity function to the high-resolution
cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG, we find agreement within a 90% confidence interval. However,
CenA seems to be missing its brightest satellites and has an overabundance of the faintest dwarfs
in comparison to its simulated analogs. In terms of the overall 3D distribution of the observed satellites,
we find that the whole structure is flattened along the line-of-sight, with an root-mean-square
(rms) height of 130 kpc and a rms semi major axis length of 330 kpc. Future distance measurements of
the remaining dwarf galaxy candidates are needed to complete the census of dwarf galaxies in the
Centaurus group.
