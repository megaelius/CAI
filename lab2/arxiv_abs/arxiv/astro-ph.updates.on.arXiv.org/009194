Herschel observations of interstellar clouds support a paradigm for star formation in which filaments
play a central role. One of the foundations of this paradigm is the finding, based on studies of the
radial column density profiles, that nearby filaments share a common inner width of ~0.1 pc. The
existence of a characteristic filament width has been questioned, however, as it seems inconsistent
with the scale-free nature of the power spectrum of cloud images. In an effort to clarify the origin
of this apparent discrepancy, we examined the power spectra of the Herschel 250 micron images of
the Polaris, Aquila, and Taurus clouds and performed a number of simple numerical experiments by
injecting synthetic filaments in both the Herschel images and synthetic background images. We
constructed several populations of synthetic filaments of 0.1 pc width with realistic area filling
factors ($A_{\rm fil}$) and distributions of column density contrasts ($\delta_c$). After adding
synthetic filaments to the Herschel images, we re-computed the image power spectra and compared
the results with the original, essentially scale-free power spectra. We used the $\chi^2$ variance
of the residuals between the best power-law fit and the output power spectrum as a diagnostic of the
presence of a significant departure from a scale-free power spectrum. We found that the $\chi^2$
variance depends primarily on the combined parameter $\delta_c^2\, A_{\rm fil}$. Analysis of
the real Herschel data shows that the observed filamentary structure contributes only 1/5 of the
power in the power spectra at angular frequencies where an effect of the characteristic filament
width is expected. We conclude that the scale-free power spectra of Herschel images remain consistent
with the existence of a characteristic filament width ~0.1 pc and do not invalidate the conclusions
drawn from studies of the filament profiles.
