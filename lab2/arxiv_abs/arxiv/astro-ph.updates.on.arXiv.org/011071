The chemical evolution of fluorine is investigated in a sample of Milky Way red giantstars that span
a significant range in metallicity from [Fe/H] \sim -1.3 to 0.0 dex. Fluorineabundances are derived
from vibration-rotation lines of HF in high-resolution infraredspectra near{\lambda}2.335{\mu}m.
The red giants are members of the thin and thick disk / halo,with two stars being likely members of
the outer disk Monoceros overdensity. At lowermetallicities, with [Fe/H]<-0.4 to -0.5, the abundance
of F varies as a primary ele-ment with respect to the Fe abundance, with a constant subsolar value
of [F/Fe] \sim -0.3 to -0.4 dex. At larger metallicities, however, [F/Fe] increases rapidly with
[Fe/H] anddisplays a near-secondary behavior with respect to Fe. Comparisons with various models
of chemical evolution suggest that in the low-metallicity regime (dominated hereby thick disk
stars), a primary evolution of19F with Fe, with a subsolar [F/Fe] valuethat roughly matches the
observed plateau can be reproduced by a model incorporatingneutrino nucleosynthesis in the aftermath
of the core collapse in supernovae of type II(SN II). A primary behavior for [F/Fe] at low metallicity
is also observed for a modelincluding rapid rotating low-metallicity massive stars but this overproduces
[F/Fe] atlow metallicity. The thick disk red giants in our sample span a large range of galacto-centric
distance (Rg \sim 6--13.7 kpc), yet display a \sim constant value of [F/Fe], indicatinga very flat
gradient (with a slope of 0.02 \pm 0.03 dex/kpc) of this elemental ratio over asignificant portion
of the Galaxy having|Z|>300 pc away from the Galaxy mid-plane.
