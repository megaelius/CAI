We investigate the anisotropy of the stellar velocity dispersions within the effective radius,
$R_{\rm e}$, in 24 ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$ pure-bulge galaxies, 16 of which are kinematic slow rotators
(SRs). We allow the spherical anisotropy parameter $\beta$ to be radially varying and allow a radial
gradient in the stellar mass-to-light ratio ($M_\star/L$) through the parameter $K$ introduced
earlier. The median anisotropy for SRs depends on $K$ as follows: $\langle\beta_{\rm m}\rangle
= a + b K$ with $a=0.19\pm 0.05$, $b=-0.13\pm 0.07$ ($\Lambda$CDM) or $a=0.21\pm 0.05$, $b=-0.26\pm
0.08$ (MOND), where $\beta_{\rm m}$ refers to the radially averaged quantity. Under the $\Lambda$CDM
paradigm this scaling is tied to a scaling of $\langle f_{\rm DM}\rangle = (0.16\pm 0.03) +(0.31\pm
0.06) K$, where $f_{\rm DM}$ refers to the DM fraction within a sphere of $r=R_{\rm e}$. For $K=0$
(constant $M_\star/L$), we obtain radially biased results with $\langle\beta_{\rm m}\rangle
\approx 0.2$ consistent with previous results. However, marginalizing over $0 < K < 1.5$ yields
$\langle\beta_{\rm m}\rangle = 0.06 ^{+0.11}_{-0.14}$ with $\langle f_{\rm DM}\rangle = 0.35
\pm 0.08$: isotropy is preferred. This isotropy hides the fact that $\beta_{\rm m}$ is correlated
with kinematic features such as counter rotating cores (CRCs), kinematically distinct cores (KDCs),
and low-level velocities (LVs): SRs with LVs are likely to be radially biased while SRs with CRCs
are likely to be tangentially biased, and SRs with KDCs are intermediate. Existing cosmological
simulations allow us to understand these results qualitatively in terms of their dynamical structures
and formation histories although there exist quantitative tensions. More realistic cosmological
simulations, particularly allowing for $M_\star/L$ gradients, may be required to better understand
SRs.
