(Abridged) METHODS: We performed SMA observations at 1.3 mm with both the most extended and compact
array configurations, providing sub-arcsecond and high sensitivity maps of various molecular
lines, including both hot-core and outflow tracers. We also reconstruct the spectral energy distribution
of the region from millimeter to near infrared wavelengths, using the Herschel/Hi-GAL maps, as
well as archival data. RESULTS: From the spectral energy distribution, we derive a bolometric luminosity
of about 4x10^4 Lsun. Our interferometric observations reveal that the distribution of dense gas
and dust in the HMC is significantly flattened and extends up to a radius of 8000 AU from the center
of radio continuum and maser emission in the region. The equatorial plane of this HMC is strictly
perpendicular to the elongation of the collimated bipolar outflow, as imaged on scales of about
0.1-0.5 pc in the main CO isotopomers as well as in the SiO(5-4) line. In the innermost HMC regions
(ca. 1000 AU), the velocity field traced by the CH3CN(12_K-11_K) line emission shows that molecular
gas is both expanding along the outflow direction following a Hubble-law, and rotating about the
outflow axis, in agreement with the (3-D) velocity field traced by methanol masers. The velocity
field associated with rotation indicates a dynamical mass of 19 Msun at the center of the core. The
latter is likely to be concentrated in a single O9.5 ZAMS star, consistent with the estimated bolometric
luminosity of G023.01-00.41. The physical properties of the CO(2-1) outflow emission, such as
its momentum rate 6x10^-3 Msun km/s /yr and its outflow rate 2x10^-4 Msun/yr, support our estimates
of the luminosity (and mass) of the embedded young stellar object.
