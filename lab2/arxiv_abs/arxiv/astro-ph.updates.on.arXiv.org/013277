Accurate photometric redshift calibration is central to the robustness of all cosmology constraints
from cosmic shear surveys. Analyses of the KiDS re-weighted training samples from all overlapping
spectroscopic surveys to provide a direct redshift calibration. Using self-organising maps (SOMs)
we demonstrate that this spectroscopic compilation is sufficiently complete for KiDS, representing
$99\%$ of the effective 2D cosmic shear sample. We use the SOM to define a $100\%$ represented `gold'
cosmic shear sample, per tomographic bin. Using mock simulations of KiDS and the spectroscopic
training set, we estimate the uncertainty on the SOM redshift calibration, and find that photometric
noise, sample variance, and spectroscopic selection effects (including redshift and magnitude
incompleteness) induce a combined maximal scatter on the bias of the redshift distribution reconstruction
($\Delta \langle z \rangle=\langle z \rangle_{\rm est}-\langle z \rangle_{\rm true}$) of $\sigma_{\Delta
\langle z \rangle} \leq 0.006$ in all tomographic bins. We show that the SOM calibration is unbiased
in the cases of noiseless photometry and perfectly representative spectroscopic datasets, as
expected from theory. The inclusion of both photometric noise and spectroscopic selection effects
in our mock data introduces a maximal bias of $\Delta \langle z \rangle =0.013\pm0.006$, or $\Delta
\langle z \rangle \leq 0.025$ at $97.5\%$ confidence, once quality flags have been applied to the
SOM. The method presented here represents a significant improvement over the previously adopted
direct redshift calibration implementation for KiDS, owing to its diagnostic and quality assurance
capabilities. The implementation of this method in future cosmic shear studies will allow better
diagnosis, examination, and mitigation of systematic biases in photometric redshift calibration.
