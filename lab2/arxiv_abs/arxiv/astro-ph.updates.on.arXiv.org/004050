The optimal source-finding strategy for linear polarization data is an unsolved problem, with
many inhibitive factors imposed by the technically-challenging nature of polarization observations.
Such an algorithm is essential for Square Kilometre Array (SKA) pathfinder surveys, such as the
Multifrequency Snapshot Sky Survey (MSSS) with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), as data volumes
are significant enough to prohibit manual inspection. We present a new strategy of `Faraday Moments'
for source-finding in linear polarization with LOFAR, using the moments of the frequency-dependent
full-Stokes data (i.e. the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and excess kurtosis). Through
simulations of the sky, we find that moments can identify polarized sources with a high completeness:
98.5% at a signal-to-noise of 5. While the method has low reliability, Rotation Measure (RM) Synthesis
can be applied per candidate source to filter out instrumental and spurious detections. This combined
strategy will result in a complete and reliable catalogue of polarized sources that includes the
full sensitivity of the observational bandwidth. We find that the technique can reduce the number
of pixels on which RM Synthesis needs to be performed by a factor of $\approx1\times10^{5}$ for source
distributions anticipated with modern radio telescopes. Through tests on LOFAR data, we find that
the technique works effectively in the presence of diffuse emission. Extensions of this method
are directly applicable to other upcoming radio surveys such as the POlarization Sky Survey of the
Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM) with the Australia Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP),
and the SKA itself.
