The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is the next generation high-energy gamma-ray observatory.
It will improve the sensitivity of current instruments up to an order of magnitude, while providing
energy coverage for photons from 20 GeV to at least 300 TeV to reach high redshifts and extreme accelerators
and will give access to the shortest time-scale phenomena. CTA is thus a uniquely powerful instrument
for the exploration of the violent and variable universe. The ability to probe short timescales
at the highest energies will allow CTA to explore the connection between accretion and ejection
phenomena surrounding compact objects, investigate the processes occurring in relativistic
outflows, and open up significant phase space for serendipitous discoveries. Aiming at playing
a central role in the era of multi-messenger astrophysics, the CTA Transient program includes follow-up
observations of a broad range of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger alerts, ranging from Galactic
compact object binary systems to novel phenomena like Fast Radio Bursts. A promising case is that
of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), where CTA will for the first time enable high-statistics measurements
above $\sim$ 10 GeV, probing new spectral components and shedding light on the physical processes
at work in these systems. Dedicated programs searching for very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray counterparts
to gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos complete the CTA transients program. This contribution
will introduce and outline the CTA Transients program. We will provide an overview of the various
science topics and discuss the links to multi-messenger and multi-wavelength observations.
