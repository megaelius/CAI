We present the results based on the optical $R$-band polarization observations of 280 stars distributed
towards the dark globule LDN 1225. Gaia data release 2 parallaxes along with the polarization data
of $\sim$200 stars have been used to (a) constrain the distance of LDN 1225 to be 800$\pm$80 pc, (b)
determine the contribution of interstellar polarization (ISP), and (c) characterize the dust
properties and delineate the magnetic field (B-field) morphology of LDN 1225. We find that B-fields
are more organized and exhibit a small dispersion of 12 degree. Using the $^{12}$CO molecular line
data from the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO), along with the column density, dispersion in B-fields,
we estimate B-field strength to be 58$\pm$12 $\mu$G, magnetic to turbulence pressure to be 3$\pm$2,
and the mass-to-magnetic flux ratio (in units of critical value) to be $<$ 1. These results indicate
the dominant role of B-fields in comparison to turbulence and gravity in rendering the cloud support.
B-fields are aligned parallel to the low-density parts (traced by $^{12}$CO map) of the cloud, in
contrast they are neither parallel nor perpendicular to the high-density core structures (traced
by $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O maps). LDN 1225 hosts two 70 $\mu$m sources which seem to be of low-mass
Class 0 sources. The total-to-selective extinction derived using optical and near-infrared photometric
data to be anomalous ($R_{V}$ = 3.6), suggesting dust grain growth in LDN 1225. Polarization efficiency
of dust grains follows a power-law index of $-$0.7 inferring that optical polarimetry traces B-fields
in the outer parts of the cloud.
