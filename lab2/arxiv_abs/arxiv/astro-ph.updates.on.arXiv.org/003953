Time-variable absorption by water vapor in Earth's atmosphere presents an important source of
systematic error for a wide range of ground-based astronomical measurements, particularly at
near-infrared wavelengths. We present results from the first study on the temporal and spatial
variability of water vapor absorption at Apache Point Observatory (APO). We analyze $\sim$400,000
high-resolution, near-infrared ($H$-band) spectra of hot stars collected as calibration data
for the APO Galactic Evolution Explorer (APOGEE) survey. We fit for the optical depths of telluric
water vapor absorption features in APOGEE spectra and convert these optical depths to Precipitable
Water Vapor (PWV) using contemporaneous data from a GPS-based PWV monitoring station at APO. Based
on simultaneous measurements obtained over a 3$^{\circ}$ field of view, we estimate that our PWV
measurement precision is $\pm0.11$ mm. We explore the statistics of PWV variations over a range
of timescales from less than an hour to days. We find that the amplitude of PWV variations within an
hour is less than 1 mm for most (96.5%) APOGEE field visits. By considering APOGEE observations that
are close in time but separated by large distances on the sky, we find that PWV is homogeneous across
the sky at a given epoch, with 90% of measurements taken up to 70$^{\circ}$ apart within 1.5 hours
having $\Delta\,\rm{PWV}<1.0$ mm. Our results can be used to help simulate the impact of water vapor
absorption on upcoming surveys at continental observing sites like APO, and also to help plan for
simultaneous water vapor metrology that may be carried out in support of upcoming photometric and
spectroscopic surveys.
