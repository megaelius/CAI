Detailed studies of intermediate/low mass pre-main sequence (PMS) stars outside the Galaxy have
so far been conducted only for small targeted regions harbouring known star formation complexes.
The VISTA Survey of the Magellanic Clouds (VMC) provides an opportunity to study PMS populations
down to solar masses on a galaxy-wide scale. Our goal is to use near-infrared data from the VMC survey
to identify and characterise PMS populations down to ~1 M_sun across the Magellanic Clouds. We present
our colour-magnitude diagram method, and apply it to a ~1.5 deg^2 pilot field located in the Large
Magellanic Cloud. The pilot field is divided into equally-sized grid elements. We compare the stellar
population in every element with the population in nearby control fields by creating K_s/(Y-K_s)
Hess diagrams; the observed density excesses over the local field population are used to classify
the stellar populations. Our analysis recovers all known star formation complexes in this pilot
field (N44, N51, N148 and N138) and for the first time reveals their true spatial extent. In total,
around 2260 PMS candidates with ages $\lesssim$ 10 Myr are found in the pilot field. PMS structures,
identified as areas with a significant density excess of PMS candidates, display a power-law distribution
of the number of members with a slope of -0.86+-0.12. We find a clustering of the young stellar populations
along ridges and filaments where dust emission in the far-infrared (FIR) (70 micron - 500 micron)
is bright. Regions with young populations lacking massive stars show a lesser degree of clustering
and are usually located in the outskirts of the star formation complexes. At short FIR wavelengths
(70 micron, 100 micron) we report a strong dust emission increase in regions hosting young massive
stars, which is less pronounced in regions populated only by less massive ($\lesssim$ 4 M_sun) PMS
stars.
