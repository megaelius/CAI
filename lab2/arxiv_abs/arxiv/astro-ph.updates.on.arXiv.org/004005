We present predictions for the outcome of deep galaxy surveys with the $James$ $Webb$ $Space$ $Telescope$
($JWST$) obtained from a physical model of galaxy formation in $\Lambda$CDM. We use the latest version
of the GALFORM model, embedded within a new ($800$ Mpc)$^{3}$ dark matter only simulation with a
halo mass resolution of $M_{\rm halo}>2\times10^{9}$ $h^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$. For computing full
UV-to-mm galaxy spectral energy distributions, including the absorption and emission of radiation
by dust, we use the spectrophotometric radiative transfer code GRASIL. The model is calibrated
to reproduce a broad range of observational data at $z\lesssim6$, and we show here that it can also
predict evolution of the rest-frame far-UV luminosity function for $7\lesssim z\lesssim10$ which
is in good agreement with observations. We make predictions for the evolution of the luminosity
function from $z=16$ to $z=0$ in all broadband filters on the Near InfraRed Camera (NIRCam) and Mid
InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) on $JWST$ and present the resulting galaxy number counts and redshift
distributions. Our fiducial model predicts that $\sim1$ galaxy per field of view will be observable
at $z\sim11$ for a $10^4$ s exposure with NIRCam. A variant model, which produces a higher redshift
of reionization in better agreement with $Planck$ data, predicts number densities of observable
galaxies $\sim5\times$ greater at this redshift. Similar observations with MIRI are predicted
not to detect any galaxies at $z\gtrsim6$. We also make predictions for the effect of different exposure
times on the redshift distributions of galaxies observable with $JWST$, and for the angular sizes
of galaxies in $JWST$ bands.
