The most dramatic phases of terrestrial planet formation are thought to be oligarchic and chaotic
growth, on timescales of up to 100-200 Myr, when violent impacts occur between large planetesimals
of sizes up to proto-planets. Such events are marked by the production of large amounts of debris
as has been observed in some exceptionally bright and young debris disks (termed extreme debris
disks). Here we report five years of Spitzer measurements of such systems around two young solar-type
stars: ID8 and P1121. The short-term (weekly to monthly) and long-term (yearly) disk variability
is consistent with the aftermaths of large impacts involving large asteroid-size bodies. We demonstrate
that an impact-produced clump of optically thick dust, under the influence of the dynamical and
viewing geometry effects, can produce short-term modulation in the disk light curves. The long-term
disk flux variation is related to the collisional evolution within the impact-produced fragments
once released into a circumstellar orbit. The time-variable behavior observed in the P1121 system
is consistent with a hypervelocity impact prior to 2012 that produced vapor condensates as the dominant
impact product. Two distinct short-term modulations in the ID8 system argue for two violent impacts
at different times and locations. Its long-term variation is consistent with the collisional evolution
of two different populations of impact-produced debris dominated by either vapor condensates
or escaping boulders. The bright, variable emission from the dust produced in large impacts from
extreme debris disks provides a unique opportunity to study violent events during the era of terrestrial
planet formation.
