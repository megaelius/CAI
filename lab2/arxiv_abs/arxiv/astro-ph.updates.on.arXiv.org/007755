We present multi-wavelength observations of an M-class flare (M3.9) that occurred on 2014 June
11. Our observations were conducted with the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST), adaptive optics, the multi-camera
system ROSA (Rapid Oscillations in Solar Atmosphere) and new HARDcam (Hydrogen-Alpha Rapid Dynamics)
camera in various wavelengths, such as Ca II K, Mg I b$_2$ (at 5172.7 \AA), and H$\alpha$ narrow-band,
and G-band continuum filters. Images were re-constructed using the Kiepencheuer-Institut Speckle
Interferometry Package (KISIP) code, to improve our image resolution. We observed intensity increases
of $\approx$120-150\% in the Mg, Ca K and H$\alpha$ narrow band filters during the flare. Intensity
increases for the flare observed in the SDO EUV channels were several times larger, and the GOES X-rays
increased over a factor of 30 for the harder band. Only a modest delay is found between the onset of
flare ribbons of a nearby sympathetic flare and the main flare ribbons observed in these narrow-band
filters. The peak flare emission occurs within a few seconds for the Ca K, Mg, and H$\alpha$ bands.
Time-distance techniques find propagation velocities of $\approx$60 km/s and as high as 300 km/s
for regions of the main flare ribbon. This result and delays and velocities observed with SDO ($\approx$100
km/s) for different coronal heights agree well with the simple model of energy propagation versus
height, although a more detailed model for the flaring solar atmosphere is needed. Future high time
resolution observations of solar flares (such as those available with DKIST) are important for
disentangling the detailed flare-physics.
