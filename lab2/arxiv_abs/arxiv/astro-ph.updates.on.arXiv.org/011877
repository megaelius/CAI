Shadows in scattered light images of protoplanetary disks are a common feature and support the presence
of warps or misalignments between disk regions. These warps are possibly due to an inclined (sub-)stellar
companion embedded in the disk. We study the morphology of the protoplanetary disk around the Herbig
Ae star HD 139614 based on the first scattered light observations of this disk, which we model with
the radiative transfer code MCMax3D. We obtained J- and H-band observations in polarized scattered
light with VLT/SPHERE that show strong azimuthal asymmetries. In the outer disk, beyond ~30 au,
a broad shadow spans a range of ~240{\deg} in position angle, in the East. A bright ring at ~16 au also
shows an azimuthally asymmetric brightness, with the faintest side roughly coincidental with
the brightest region of the outer disk. Additionally, two arcs are detected at ~34 au and ~50 au. We
created a simple 4-zone approximation to a warped disk model of HD 139614 in order to qualitatively
reproduce these features. The location and misalignment of the disk components were constrained
from the shape and location of the shadows they cast. We find that the shadow on the outer disk covers
a range of position angle too wide to be explained by a single inner misaligned component. Our model
requires a minimum of two separate misaligned zones -- or a continuously warped region -- to cast
this broad shadow on the outer disk. A small misalignment of ~4{\deg} between adjacent components
can reproduce most of the observed shadow features. Multiple misaligned disk zones, potentially
mimicing a warp, can explain the observed broad shadows in the HD 139614 disk. A planetary mass companion
in the disk, located on an inclined orbit, could be responsible for such a feature and for the dust
depleted gap responsible for a dip in the SED.
