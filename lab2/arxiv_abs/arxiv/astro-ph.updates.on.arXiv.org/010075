Infrared and nebular lines provide some of our best probes of the physics regulating the properties
of the interstellar medium (ISM) at high-redshift. However, interpreting the physical conditions
of high-redshift galaxies directly from emission lines remains complicated due to inhomogeneities
in temperature, density, metallicity, ionisation parameter, and spectral hardness. We present
a new suite of cosmological, radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, each centred on a massive Lyman-break
galaxy that resolves such properties in an inhomogeneous ISM. Many of the simulated systems exhibit
transient but well defined gaseous disks that appear as velocity gradients in [CII]~158.6$\mu$m
emission. Spatial and spectral offsets between [CII]~158.6$\mu$m and [OIII]~88.33$\mu$m are
common, but not ubiquitous, as each line probes a different phase of the ISM. These systems fall on
the local [CII]-SFR relation, consistent with newer observations that question previously observed
[CII]~158.6$\mu$m deficits. Our galaxies are consistent with the nebular line properties of observed
$z\sim2-3$ galaxies and reproduce offsets on the BPT and mass-excitation diagrams compared to
local galaxies due to higher star formation rate (SFR), excitation, and specific-SFR, as well as
harder spectra from young, metal-poor binaries. We predict that local calibrations between H$\alpha$
and [OII]~3727$\AA$ luminosity and galaxy SFR apply up to $z>10$, as do the local relations between
certain strong line diagnostics (R23 and [OIII]~5007$\AA$/H$\beta$) and galaxy metallicity.
Our new simulations are well suited to interpret the observations of line emission from current
(ALMA and HST) and upcoming facilities (JWST and ngVLA).
