The present paper focuses on the eclipsing binary KIC 8553788 which belongs to two different types
of binary systems regarding its physical properties. In particular, it is one of the 71 oscillating
stars of Algol type that have been discovered so far and one of the six that have been published based
on high cadence data of the Kepler mission. In addition, it is one of the four semi-detached binaries
of the group of R CMa type systems, while its pulsating component has the fourth fastest frequency
among the delta Scuti stars-members of semi-detached binaries. Detailed light curves, spectroscopic
and pulsation analyses are presented, while possible explanation scenarios for the evolution
of the system involving past mass transfer, mass loss and/or angular momentum loss due to the presence
of a tertiary component are discussed. The goal of the study is to extract the pulsational characteristics
of the oscillating star of the system, to estimate the absolute parameters of its components and
to provide possible explanation for its extreme evolutionary status. The results show that the
primary component of the system is of A8 spectral type, has a mass of 1.6 M_sun, and a radius of 2 R_sun.
It is a relatively fast pulsator that oscillates in 89 frequency modes with the dominant one to be
58.26 c/d. The secondary component has a mass of only 0.07 M_sun, a radius of 1 R_sun, and a temperature
of 4400 K. KIC 8553788 according to its geometrical configuration and its pulsational properties
belongs to the group of the oscillating stars of Algol type, while according to its very low mass ratio
and its relatively short orbital period belongs also to the group of R CMa stars. If confirmed by radial
velocity data of the secondary component, the system would have the lowest mass ratio that has ever
been found in semi-detached systems and it can be considered as one of the most extreme cases.
