Understanding the evolutionary history of the Magellanic Clouds requires an in-depth exploration
and characterization of the stellar content in their outer regions, which ultimately are key to
tracing the epochs and nature of past interactions. We present new deep images of a shell-like over-density
of stars in the outskirts of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The shell, also detected in photographic
plates dating back to the fifties, is located at ~1.9 degr from the center of the SMC in the north-east
direction.The structure and stellar content of this feature were studied with multi-band, optical
data from the Survey of the MAgellanic Stellar History (SMASH) carried out with the Dark Energy Camera
on the Blanco Telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. We also investigate the kinematic
of the stars in the shell using the Gaia Data Release 2. The shell is composed of a young population
with an age ~ 150 Myr, with no contribution from an old population. Thus, it is hard to explain its origin
as the remnant of a tidally disrupted stellar system. The spatial distribution of the young main-sequence
stars shows a rich sub-structure, with a spiral arm-like feature emanating from the main shell and
a separated small arc of young stars close to the globular cluster NGC 362. We find that the absolute
g-band magnitude of the shell is M_{g,shell} = -10.78+/- 0.02, with a surface brightness of mu_{g,shell}
= 25.81+/- 0.01 mag/arcsec^{2}. We have not found any evidence that this feature is of tidal origin
or a bright part of a spiral arm-like structure. Instead, we suggest that the shell formed in a recent
star formation event, likely triggered by an interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud and/or
the Milky Way, ~150 Myr ago.
