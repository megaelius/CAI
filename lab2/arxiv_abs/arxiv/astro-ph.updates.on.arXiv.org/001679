Mid-infrared (MIR) spectra observed with Gemini/Michelle were used to study the nuclear region
of the Compton-thick Seyfert 2 (Sy 2) galaxy Mrk 3 at a spatial resolution of $\sim$200 pc. No polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emission bands were detected in the N-band spectrum of Mrk 3. However,
intense [Ar III] 8.99 $\mu$m, [S IV] 10.5 $\mu$m and [Ne II] 12.8 $\mu$m ionic emission-lines, as
well as silicate absorption feature at 9.7$\mu$m have been found in the nuclear extraction ($\sim$200
pc). We also present subarcsecond-resolution Michelle N-band image of Mrk 3 which resolves its
circumnuclear region. This diffuse MIR emission shows up as a wings towards East-West direction
closely aligned with the S-shaped of the Narrow Line Region (NLR) observed at optical [O III]$\lambda$5007\AA
image with Hubble/FOC. The nuclear continuum spectrum can be well represented by a theoretical
torus spectral energy distribution (SED), suggesting that the nucleus of Mrk 3 may host a dusty toroidal
structure predicted by the unified model of active galactic nucleus (AGN). In addition, the hydrogen
column density (N$_H\,=\,4.8^{+3.3}_{-3.1}\times\,10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) estimated with a torus
model for Mrk 3 is consistent with the value derived from X-ray spectroscopy. The torus model geometry
of Mrk 3 is similar to that of NGC 3281, both Compton-thick galaxies, confirmed through fitting the
9.7$\mu$m silicate band profile. This results might provide further evidence that the silicate-rich
dust can be associated with the AGN torus and may also be responsible for the absorption observed
at X-ray wavelengths in those galaxies.
