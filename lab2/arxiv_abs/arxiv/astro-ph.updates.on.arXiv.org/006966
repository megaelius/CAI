The environmental effect is commonly used to explain the excess of gas-poor galaxies in galaxy clusters.
Meanwhile, the presence of gas-poor galaxies at cluster outskirts, where galaxies have not spent
enough time to feel the cluster environmental effect, hints for the presence of pre-processing.
Using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations on 16 clusters, we investigate the mechanisms of
gas depletion of galaxies found inside clusters. The gas depletion mechanisms can be categorized
into three channels based on where and when they took place. First, 34$\%$ of our galaxies are gas
poor before entering clusters (`pre-processing'). They are mainly satellites that have undergone
the environmental effect inside group halos. Second, 43$\%$ of the sample became quickly gas deficient
in clusters before the first pericentric pass (`fast cluster processing'). Some of them were group
satellites that are low in gas at the time of cluster entry compared to the galaxies directly coming
from the field. Even the galaxies with large gas fractions take this channel if they fall into massive
clusters ($> 10^{14.5}\, \rm M_{\odot}$) or approach cluster centers through radial orbits. Third,
24$\%$ of our sample retain gas even after their first pericentric pass (`slow cluster processing')
as they fall into the less massive clusters and/or have circular orbits. The relative importance
of each channel varies with a cluster's mass, while the exact degree of significance is subject to
large uncertainties. Group pre-processing accounts for a third of the total gas depletion; but
it also determines the gas fraction of galaxies at their cluster entry which in turn determines whether
a galaxy should take the fast or the slow cluster processing.
