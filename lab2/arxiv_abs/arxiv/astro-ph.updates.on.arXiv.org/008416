We present the chemodynamic structure of the solar neighbourhood using 62 814 stars within a 500
pc sphere of the Sun observed by GALAH and with astrometric parameters from Gaia DR2. We measure the
velocity dispersion for all three components (vertical, radial, and tangential) and find that
it varies smoothly with [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] for each component. The vertical component is
especially clean, with $\sigma_{v_z}$ increasing from a low of $8$ km s$^{-1}$ at solar-[$\alpha$/Fe]
and [Fe/H] to a high of more than 50 km s$^{-1}$ for more metal-poor and [$\alpha$/Fe] enhanced populations.
We find no evidence of a large decrease in the velocity dispersion of the higher-[$\alpha$/Fe] populations
as claimed in analysis prior to Gaia DR2, although the trend of increasing velocity dispersion with
[$\alpha$/Fe] for the same metallicity does significantly flatten at high-[$\alpha$/Fe]. The
eccentricity distribution for local stars varies most strongly as a function of [$\alpha$/Fe],
where stars with [$\alpha$/Fe]$<0.1$ dex having generally circular orbits ($e<0.15$), while
the median eccentricity increases rapidly for more [$\alpha$/Fe]-enhanced stellar populations
up to $e\sim0.35$. These [$\alpha$/Fe]-enhanced populations have guiding radii consistent with
origins in the inner Galaxy. Of the stars with metallicities much higher than the local ISM ([Fe/H]>0.1
dex), we find that more than 70\% have $e<0.2$ and are likely observed in the solar neighbourhood
through churning/migration rather than blurring effects, as the epicyclic motion for these stars
is not large enough to reach the radii at which they were likely born based on their metallicity.
