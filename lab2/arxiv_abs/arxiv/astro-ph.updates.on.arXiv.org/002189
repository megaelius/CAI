We present astrometric observations of the Saturnian satellites Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione
and Rhea from Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) narrow-angle camera (NAC) images. Image
sequences were designed to observe mutual occultations between these satellites. The positions
of satellite centres were estimated by fitting ellipsoidal shape models to the measured limbs of
the imaged satellites. Spacecraft pointing corrections were computed using the UCAC2 star catalogue.
We provide a total of 2303 astrometric observations, resulting in 976 pairs, the remainder consisting
of observations of a single satellite. Mean residuals for the individual satellite positions relative
to the SAT360 ephemeris were 4.3 km in the line direction and -2.4 km in the sample direction, with
standard deviations of 5.6 and 7.0 km respectively, an order of magnitude improvement in precision
compared to published HST observations. By considering inter-satellite separations, uncertainties
in camera pointing and spacecraft positioning along with possible biases in the individual positions
of the satellites can be largely eliminated, resulting in an order-of-magnitude increase in accuracy
compared to that achievable using the individual satellite positions. We show how factors relating
to the viewing geometry cause small biases in the individual positions of order 0.28 pixel to become
systematic across the dataset as a whole and discuss options for reducing their effects . The reduced
astrometric data are provided in the form of individual positions for each satellite, together
with the measured positions of reference stars, in order to allow more flexibility in the processing
of the observations, taking into account possible future advances in limb-fitting techniques
as well as the future availability of more accurate star catalogues, such as those from the GAIA mission.
