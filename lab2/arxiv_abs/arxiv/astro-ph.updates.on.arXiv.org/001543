We present the most extensive analysis of Fourier-based X-ray timing properties of the black hole
binary Cygnus X-1 to date, based on 12 years of bi-weekly monitoring with RXTE from 1999 to 2011. Our
aim is a comprehensive study of timing behavior across all spectral states, including the elusive
transitions and extreme hard and soft states. We discuss the dependence of the timing properties
on spectral shape and photon energy, and study correlations between Fourier-frequency dependent
coherence and time lags with features in the power spectra. Our main results are: (a) The fractional
rms in the 0.125-256 Hz range in different spectral states shows complex behavior that depends on
the energy range considered. It reaches its maximum not in the hard state, but in the soft state in
the Comptonized tail above 10 keV. (b) The shape of power spectra in hard and intermediate states
and the normalization in the soft state are strongly energy dependent in the 2.1-15 keV range. This
emphasizes the need for an energy-dependent treatment of power spectra and a careful consideration
of energy- and mass-scaling when comparing the variability of different source types, e.g., black
hole binaries and AGN. PSDs during extremely hard and extremely soft states can be easily confused
for energies above ~5 keV in the 0.125-256 Hz range. (c) The coherence between energy bands drops
during transitions from the intermediate into the soft state but recovers in the soft state. (d)
The time lag spectra in soft and intermediate states show distinct features at frequencies related
to the frequencies of the main variability components seen in the power spectra and show the same
shift to higher frequencies as the source softens. [...abridged] In particular, we discuss how
the timing properties of Cyg X-1 can be used to assess the evolution of variability with spectral
shape in other black hole binaries. [...abridged]
