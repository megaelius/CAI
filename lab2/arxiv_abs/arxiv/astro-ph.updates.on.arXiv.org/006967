We present a method for automatic detection and classification of galaxies which includes a novel
data-augmentation procedure to make trained models more robust against the data taken from different
instruments and contrast-stretching functions. This method is shown as part of AstroCV, a growing
open source computer vision repository for processing and analyzing big astronomical datasets,
including high performance Python and C++ algorithms used in the areas of image processing and computer
vision. The underlying models were trained using convolutional neural networks and deep learning
techniques, which provide better results than methods based on manual feature engineering and
SVMs in most of the cases where training datasets are large. The detection and classification methods
were trained end-to-end using public datasets such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Galaxy
Zoo, and private datasets such as the Next Generation Virgo (NGVS) and Fornax (NGFS) surveys. Training
results are strongly bound to the conversion method from raw FITS data for each band into a 3-channel
color image. Therefore, we propose data augmentation for the training using 5 conversion methods.
This greatly improves the overall galaxy detection and classification for images produced from
different instruments, bands and data reduction procedures. The detection and classification
methods were trained using the deep learning framework DARKNET and the real-time object detection
system YOLO. These methods are implemented in C language and CUDA platform, and makes intensive
use of graphical processing units (GPU). Using a single high-end Nvidia GPU card, it can process
a SDSS image in 50 milliseconds and a DECam image in less than 3 seconds.
