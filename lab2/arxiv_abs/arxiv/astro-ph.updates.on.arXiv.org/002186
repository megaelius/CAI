We present deep and high-resolution (FWHM ~ 0.4 arcsec) near-infrared (NIR) imaging observations
of the NGC 7538 IRS 1-3 region (in JHK bands), and IRS 9 region (in HK bands) using the 8.2m Subaru telescope.
The NIR analysis is complemented with GMRT low-frequency observations at 325, 610, and 1280 MHz,
molecular line observations of H13CO+ (J=1-0), and archival Chandra X-ray observations. Using
the 'J-H/H-K' diagram, 144 Class II and 24 Class I young stellar object (YSO) candidates are identified
in the IRS 1-3 region. Further analysis using 'K/H-K' diagram yields 145 and 96 red sources in the
IRS 1-3 and IRS 9 regions, respectively. A total of 27 sources are found to have X-ray counterparts.
The YSO mass function (MF), constructed using a theoretical mass-luminosity relation, shows peaks
at substellar (~0.08-0.18 Msolar) and intermediate (~1-1.78 Msolar) mass ranges for the IRS 1-3
region. The MF can be fitted by a power law in the low mass regime with a slope of Gamma ~ 0.54-0.75, which
is much shallower than the Salpeter value of 1.35. An upper limit of 10.2 is obtained for the star to
brown dwarf ratio in the IRS 1-3 region. GMRT maps show a compact HII region associated with the IRS
1-3 sources, whose spectral index of 0.87+-0.11 suggests optical thickness. This compact region
is resolved into three separate peaks in higher resolution 1280 MHz map, and the 'East' sub-peak
coincides with the IRS 2 source. H13CO+ (J=1-0) emission reveals peaks in both IRS 1-3 and IRS 9 regions,
none of which are coincident with visible nebular emission, suggesting the presence of dense cloud
nearby. The virial masses are approximately of the order of 1000 Msolar and 500 Msolar for the clumps
in IRS 1-3 and IRS 9 regions, respectively.
