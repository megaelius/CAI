We discuss prospects of identifying and characterizing black hole (BH) companions to normal stars
on tight but detached orbits, using photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite
(TESS). We focus on the following two periodic signals from the visible stellar component: (i) in-eclipse
brightening of the star due to gravitational microlensing by the BH (self-lensing), and (ii) a combination
of ellipsoidal variations due to tidal distortion of the star and relativistic beaming due to its
orbital motion (phase-curve variation). We evaluate the detectability of each signal in the light
curves of stars in the TESS input catalog, based on a pre-launch noise model of TESS photometry as
well as the actual light curves of spotted stars from the prime Kepler mission to gauge the potential
impact of stellar activity arising from the tidally spun-up stellar components. We estimate that
the self-lensing and phase-curve signals from BH companions, if exist, will be detectable in the
light curves of effectively $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ low-mass stars, respectively,
taking into account orbital inclination dependence of the signals. These numbers could be large
enough to actually detect signals from BHs: simple population models predict some 10 and 100 detectable
BHs among these "searchable" stars, although the latter may be associated with a comparable number
of false-positives due to stellar variabilities and additional vetting with radial velocity measurements
would be essential. Thus the TESS data could serve as a resource to study nearby BHs with stellar companions
on shorter-period orbits than will potentially be probed with Gaia.
