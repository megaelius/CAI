Stars in young nearby associations are the only targets allowing giant planet searches at all separations
in the near future, by coupling indirect techniques such as radial velocity and deep imaging. These
stars are first priorities targets for the forthcoming planets imagers on 10-m class telescopes.
Young stars rotate more rapidly and are more active than their older counterparts. Both effects
can limit the capability to detect planets using RV. We wish to explore the planet detection capabilities
of a representative sample of stars in close and young associations with radial velocity data and
explore the complementarity between this technique and direct imaging. We observed 26 such targets
with spectral types from A to K and ages from 8 to 300 Myr with HARPS. We compute the detection limits.
We also attempt to improve the detection limits in a few cases by correcting for the stellar activity.
Our A-type stars RV show high frequency variations due to pulsations, while our F-K stars clearly
show activity with more or less complex patterns. For F-K stars, the RV jitter and v sini rapidly decrease
with star age. The data allow us to search for planets with periods typically ranging from 1 day to
100 days, and up to more than 500 days in a few cases. Within the present detection limits, no planet
was found in our sample. For the bulk of our F-K stars, the detection limits fall down to sub-Jupiter
masses.We show that these limits can be significantly improved by correcting even partially for
stellar activity, down to a few Neptune masses for the least active stars. The detection limits on
A-type stars can be significantly improved, down to a few Jupiter mass planets, provided an appropriate
observing strategy. We finally show the tremendous potential of coupling RV and AO deep imaging
results.
