Using the most recent Kepler catalog, we reconstruct the occurrence rate of small (Neptune-sized
or below) planets as a function of orbital period and planet radius, taking careful account of various
detection biases. We analyze a sample of $76,000$ Sun-like stars and their associated planet candidates
with periods between $20$ and $200$ days, and sizes between $1$ and $4 R_\oplus$. Such planets have
likely experienced little photoevaporation, and may reflect the "primordial" planet population.
Assuming that the size distribution of planets are independent of their orbital periods (and vice
versa), we conclude that Kepler planets are preferentially peaked at $2-2.8 R_\oplus$, with their
numbers decreasing gradually toward smaller sizes. These planets are found roughly uniformly
in logarithmic period. The average number of planets per star, in the stated period and size ranges,
is $0.46 \pm 0.03$. This number rises by $\sim 0.2$ if one includes planets inward of $20$ days. Upon
extrapolation we obtain an occurrence rate, for Earth-like planets within the "habitable zone"
(as calculated by 1-D climate models), of $6.4^{+3.4}_{-1.1}\%$. We discuss the astrophysical
implications of our results. In our study, we introduce a number of novel statistical approaches,
including the adoption of the "iterative simulation" technique (in addition to the standard MCMC
technique), incorporation of uncertainties in planet radii, and an improved consideration of
detection bias. Our results largely agree with those from an earlier work by Petigura et al. (2013),
based on different statistical treatments and noise models. However, this agreement masks two
substantial underlying discrepancies that (to first order) cancel each other out.
