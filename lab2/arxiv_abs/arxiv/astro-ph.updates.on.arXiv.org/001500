The photometric characterization of M33 star clusters is far from complete. In this paper, we present
homogeneous $UBVRI$ photometry of 708 star clusters and cluster candidates in M33 based on archival
images from the Local Group Galaxies Survey, which covers 0.8 deg$^2$ along the galaxy's major axis.
Our photometry includes 387, 563, 616, 580, and 478 objects in the $UBVRI$ bands, respectively,
of which 276, 405, 430, 457, and 363 do not have previously published $UBVRI$ photometry. Our photometry
is consistent with previous measurements (where available) in all filters. We adopted Sloan Digital
Sky Survey $ugriz$ photometry for complementary purposes, as well as Two Micron All-Sky Survey
near-infrared $JHK$ photometry where available. We fitted the spectral-energy distributions
of 671 star clusters and candidates to derive their ages, metallicities, and masses based on the
updated {\sc parsec} simple stellar populations synthesis models. The results of our $\chi^2$
minimization routines show that only 205 of the 671 clusters ($31\%$) are older than 2 Gyr, which
represents a much smaller fraction of the cluster population than that in M31 ($56\%$), suggesting
that M33 is dominated by young star clusters ($<1$ Gyr). We investigate the mass distributions
of the star clusters---both open and globular clusters---in M33, M31, the Milky Way, and the Large
Magellanic Cloud. Their mean values are $\log(M_{\rm cl}/M_{\odot})=4.25$, 5.43, 2.72, and 4.18,
respectively. The fraction of open to globular clusters is highest in the Milky Way and lowest in
M31. Our comparisons of the cluster ages, masses, and metallicities show that our results are basically
in agreement with previous studies (where objects in common are available); differences can be
traced back to differences in the models adopted, the fitting methods used, and stochastic sampling
effects.
