The free-streaming length of dark matter depends on fundamental dark matter physics, and determines
the abundance and concentration of dark matter halos on sub-galactic scales. Using the image positions
and flux ratios from eight quadruply-imaged quasars, we constrain the free-streaming length of
dark matter and the amplitude of the subhalo mass function (SHMF). We model both main deflector subhalos
and halos along the line of sight, and account for warm dark matter (WDM) free-streaming effects
on the mass function and mass-concentration relation. By calibrating the scaling of the SHMF with
host halo mass and redshift using a suite of simulated halos, we infer a global normalization for
the SHMF. We account for finite-size background sources, and marginalize over the mass profile
of the main deflector. Parameterizing dark matter free-streaming through the half-mode mass $m_{\rm{hm}}$,
we constrain the thermal relic particle mass $m_{\rm{DM}}$ corresponding to $m_{\rm{hm}}$. At
$95 \%$ CI: $m_{\rm{hm}} < 10^{7.8} M_{\odot}$ ($m_{\rm{DM}} > 5.2 \ \rm{keV}$). We disfavor $m_{\rm{DM}}
= 4.0 \rm{keV}$ and $ m_{\rm{DM}} = 3.0 \rm{keV}$ with likelihood ratios of 7:1 and 30:1, respectively,
relative to the peak of the posterior distribution. Assuming cold dark matter, we constrain the
projected mass in substructure between $10^6 - 10^{9} M_{\odot}$ near lensed images. At $68 \%$
CI, we infer $2.0 - 6.1 \times 10^{7} M_{\odot} \rm{kpc^{-2}}$, corresponding to mean projected
mass fraction $\bar{f}_{\rm{sub}} = 0.035_{-0.017}^{+0.021}$. At $95 \%$ CI, we obtain a lower
bound on the projected mass of $0.6 \times 10^{7} M_{\odot} \rm{kpc^{-2}}$, corresponding to $\bar{f}_{\rm{sub}}
> 0.005$. These results agree with the predictions of cold dark matter.
