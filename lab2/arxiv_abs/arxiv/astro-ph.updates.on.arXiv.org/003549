We present physical properties [redshifts (z), star-formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses
(Mstar)] of bright (S850>4mJy) submm galaxies in the ~2deg2 COSMOS and UDS fields selected with
SCUBA-2/JCMT. We complete the galaxy identification process for all (~2000) S/N>3.5 850-um sources,
but focus our scientific analysis on a high-quality sub-sample of 651 S/N>4 sources with complete
multi-wavelength coverage including 1.1-mm imaging. We check the reliability of our identifications,
and the robustness of the SCUBA-2 fluxes by revisiting the recent ALMA follow-up of 29 sources in
our sample. Considering >4mJy ALMA sources, our identification method has a completeness of ~86
per cent with a reliability of ~92 per cent, and only ~15-20 per cent of sources are significantly
affected by multiplicity (when a secondary component contributes >1/3 of the primary source flux).
The impact of source blending on the 850-um source counts as determined with SCUBA-2 is modest; scaling
the single-dish fluxes by ~0.9 reproduces the ALMA source counts. For our final SCUBA-2 sample we
find median z=2.40+0.10-0.04, SFR=287+-6Moyr-1, and log(Mstar/Mo)=11.12+-0.02 (the latter
for 349/651 sources with optical identifications). These properties clearly locate bright submm
galaxies on the high-mass end of the 'main sequence' of star-forming galaxies out to z~6, suggesting
that major mergers are not a dominant driver of the high-redshift submm-selected population. Their
number densities are also consistent with the evolving galaxy stellar mass function. Hence, the
submm galaxy population is as expected, albeit reproducing the evolution of the main sequence of
star-forming galaxies remains a challenge for theoretical models/simulations.
