We obtained high-resolution infrared spectroscopy and short-cadence photometry of the 600-800
Myr Praesepe star K2-100 during transits of its 1.67-day planet. This Neptune-size object, discovered
by the NASA K2 mission, is an interloper in the "desert" of planets with similar radii on short period
orbits. Our observations can be used to understand its origin and evolution by constraining the
orbital eccentricity by transit fitting, measuring the spin-orbit obliquity by the Rossiter-McLaughlin
effect, and detecting any extended, escaping hydrogen-helium envelope with the 10830A line of
neutral helium in the 2s3S triplet state. Transit photometry with 1-min cadence was obtained by
the K2 satellite during Campaign 18 and transit spectra were obtained with the IRD spectrograph
on the Subaru telescope. While the elevated activity of K2-100 prevented us from detecting the Rossiter-McLaughlin
effect, the new photometry combined with revised stellar parameters allowed us to constrain the
eccentricity to e < 0.15/0.28 with 90%/99% confidence. We modeled atmospheric escape as an isothermal,
spherically symmetric Parker wind, with photochemistry driven by UV radiation that we estimate
by combining the observed spectrum of the active Sun with calibrations from observations of K2-100
and similar young stars in the nearby Hyades cluster. Our non-detection (<5.7mA) of a transit-associated
He I line limits mass loss of a solar-composition atmosphere through a T<10000K wind to <0.3Me/Gyr.
Either K2-100b is an exceptional desert-dwelling planet, or its mass loss is occurring at a lower
rate over a longer interval, consistent with a core accretion-powered scenario for escape.
