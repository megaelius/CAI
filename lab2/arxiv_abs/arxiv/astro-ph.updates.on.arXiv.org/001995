We propose a novel approach for parameterizing the luminosity distance, based on the use of rational
"Pad\'e" approximations. This new technique extends standard Taylor treatments, overcoming
possible convergence issues at high redshifts plaguing standard cosmography. Indeed, we show
that Pad\'e expansions enable us to confidently use data over a larger interval with respect to the
usual Taylor series. To show this property in detail, we propose several Pad\'e expansions and we
compare these approximations with cosmic data, thus obtaining cosmographic bounds from the observable
universe for all cases. In particular, we fit Pad\'e luminosity distances with observational data
from different uncorrelated surveys. We employ union 2.1 supernova data, baryonic acoustic oscillation,
Hubble space telescope measurements and differential age data. In so doing, we also demonstrate
that the use of Pad\'e approximants can improve the analyses carried out by introducing cosmographic
auxiliary variables, i.e. a standard technique usually employed in cosmography in order to overcome
the divergence problem. Moreover, for any drawback related to standard cosmography, we emphasize
possible resolutions in the framework of Pad\'e approximants. In particular, we investigate how
to reduce systematics, how to overcome the degeneracy between cosmological coefficients, how
to treat divergences and so forth. As a result, we show that cosmic bounds are actually refined through
the use of Pad\'e treatments and the thus derived best values of the cosmographic parameters show
slight departures from the standard cosmological paradigm. Although all our results are perfectly
consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model, evolving dark energy components different from a pure
cosmological constant are not definitively ruled out.
