Patsourakos et al. (Astrophys. J. 817, 14, 2016) and Patsourakos and Georgoulis (Astron. Astrophys.
595, A121, 2016) introduced a method to infer the axial magnetic field in flux-rope coronal mass
ejections (CMEs) in the solar corona and farther away in the interplanetary medium. The method,
based on the conservation principle of magnetic helicity, uses the relative magnetic helicity
of the solar source region as input estimates, along with the radius and length of the corresponding
CME flux rope. The method was initially applied to cylindrical force-free flux ropes, with encouraging
results. We hereby extend our framework along two distinct lines. First, we generalize our formalism
to several possible flux-rope configurations (linear and nonlinear force-free, non-force-free,
spheromak, and torus) to investigate the dependence of the resulting CME axial magnetic field on
input parameters and the employed flux-rope configuration. Second, we generalize our framework
to both Sun-like and active M-dwarf stars hosting superflares. In a qualitative sense, we find that
Earth may not experience severe atmosphere-eroding magnetospheric compression even for eruptive
solar superflares with energies ~ 10^4 times higher than those of the largest Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite (GOES) X-class flares currently observed. In addition, the two recently
discovered exoplanets with the highest Earth-similarity index, Kepler 438b and Proxima b, seem
to lie in the prohibitive zone of atmospheric erosion due to interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs), except
when they possess planetary magnetic fields that are much higher than that of Earth.
