We perform multiwavelength time-distance analysis of a fan loop system anchored in an isolated
sunspot region AR 12553. The active region was observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board
the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We measure the phase speeds of the propagating intensity disturbances
by employing cross-correlation analysis, as well as by obtaining the slopes in xt-plots. We obtain
original as well as de-trended light curves at different heights of the time-distance maps and characterize
them by performing Fouri\'er and Wavelet analysis, respectively. The time-distance maps reveal
clear propagation of intensity oscillations in all the coronal EUV channels except AIA 94 and 335~{\AA}.
We determine the nature of the intensity disturbances as slow magnetoacoustic waves by measuring
their phase speeds. The time-distance maps, as well as the de-trended light curves, show an increase
and decrease in the amplitude of propagating 3-min oscillations over time. The amplitude variations
appear most prominent in AIA 171~{\AA}, though other EUV channels also show such signatures. Fouri\'er
power spectrum yield the presence of significant powers with several nearby frequencies between
2--3 minutes (5--8 mHz), along with many other smaller peaks between 2--4 minutes. Wavelet analysis
shows an increase and decrease of oscillating power around 3-min simultaneous to the amplitude
variations. We obtain the modulation period to be in the range of 20--30 minutes. Our results provide
the viability of occurrence of phenomenon like `Beat' among the nearby frequencies giving rise
to the observed amplitude modulation. However, we cannot, at this stage, rule out the possibility
that the modulation may be driven by variability of an underlying unknown source.
