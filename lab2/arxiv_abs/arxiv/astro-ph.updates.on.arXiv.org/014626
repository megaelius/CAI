Two repeating FRB sources, FRB180916 (CHIME/FRB Collaboration, 2020) and FRB121102 (Rajwade,
et al., 2020) display behavior in periodic windows (PWB) in the times of FRB detections. Events displaying
PWB occur not strictly periodically, but within a periodic window spanning some fraction of the
period; no events occur at all during many of the periods in the data set, however. During 2020 May,
coincident X-ray bursts and fast radio bursts (FRBs) observed from SGR1935+2154 (GCN 27675) established
a clear link between at least some FRBs and magnetars, the apparent source of SGR bursts, in line with
several theoretical models. Examination of X-ray burst data on SGR1935+2154 from 2014 through
2020 from IPN (Interplanetary Network) X- and Gamma-ray instruments suggested these data might
also display PWB. Applying a periodic folding analysis to our largest data sample, 174 bursts, a
minimum window fraction of 56% covered all burst times at a 232 day folding period. The data are inhomogeneous
and cover only 6 bursting episodes; discovering events outside of our proposed window and periodicity
could negate or seriously reduce the scope of these conclusions. However, for several sub-samples
of the data, the same period gives the minimum window fraction, and for all sub-samples, this period
yielded among the lowest window fractions. Simulating events at random among the same time period
yields window fractions <56% for 32 bursts with probability around 4X10^-5; the probability of
a similar W100 would be vanishingly small for 174 bursts. These checks suggest the result is robust,
and not due to a data set that is too small. The presence of some kind of periodicity in the X-ray bursts
of this SGR should therefore provide useful hints as to the mechanism behind SGR bursts, and by association,
FRBs.
