As part of our "Ultra-Fast Astronomy" (UFA) program, we present initial measurements of silicon
photomultiplier detector (SiPM) performance for application to measurement of variability of
optical astronomical targets on millisecond and shorter time scales. We mounted two different
SiPM detectors at the focal plane of the 0.7 meter Nazarbayev University Transient Telescope at
the Assy-Turgen Astrophysical Observatory (NUTTelA-TAO), with no filter in front of the detector,
and measured their performance. The $3mm\times3mm$ SiPM detectors had a field of view of $2.2716'\times2.2716'$
for each SiPM channel. During the nights of 28-29/10/2019, we measured sky background, bright stars,
and an artificial source with a 100Hz flashing frequency. We compared detected SiPM counts with
Gaia satellite G band flux values to show that our SiPM detectors have linear response. With our two
SiPMs (models S14520-3050VS and S14160-3050HS), we measured a dark current of $\sim$130 and $\sim$85
kilo count per second (kcps), and a sky background of $\sim$191 and $\sim$203 kcps, respectively.
We measured an intrinsic crosstalk of 10.34$\%$ and 10.52$\%$ for the two detectors, respectively.
We derive a 5$\sigma$ sensitivity of 14.7 and 15.2 Gaia G-band magnitude for 200ms exposures, for
the two detectors, respectively. We derive, for transient events in 10$\mu s$ time window, a sensitivity
of 20 detected photons or 6.1 Gaia G-band magnitudes. For shorter timescales , e.g. 100ns, our detection
limit is limited by crosstalk to 12 detected photons, which correspond to fluence of $\sim$133 photons
per square meter within 100ns.
