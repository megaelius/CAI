We study the m=1 distortions (lopsidedness) in the stellar components of 167 nearby galaxies that
span a wide range of morphologies and luminosities. We confirm the previous findings of 1) a high
incidence of lopsidedness in the stellar distributions, 2) increasing lopsidedness as a function
of radius out to at least 3.5 exponential scale lengths, and 3) greater lopsidedness, over these
radii, for galaxies of later type and lower surface brightness. Additionally, the magnitude of
the lopsidedness 1) correlates with the character of the spiral arms (stronger arm patterns occur
in galaxies with less lopsidedness), 2) is not correlated with the presence or absence of a bar, or
the strength of the bar when one is present, 3) is inversely correlated to the stellar mass fraction,
f_*, within one radial scale length, and 4) correlates directly with f_* measured within the radial
range over which we measure lopsidedness. We interpret these findings to mean that lopsidedness
is a generic feature of galaxies and does not, generally, depend on a rare event, such as a direct accretion
of a satellite galaxy onto the disk of the parent galaxy. While lopsidedness may be caused by several
phenomena, moderate lopsidedness (<A_1>_i + <A_1>_o)/2 < 0.3) is likely to reflect
halo asymmetries to which the disk responds or a gravitationally self-generated mode . We hypothesize
that the magnitude of the stellar response depends both on how centrally concentrated the stars
are with respect to the dark matter and whether there are enough stars in the region of the lopsidedness
that self-gravity is dynamically important.
