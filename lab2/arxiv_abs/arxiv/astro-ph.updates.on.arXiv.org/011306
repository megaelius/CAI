Black hole feedback plays a central role in shaping the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of elliptical
galaxies. We systematically study the impact of plasma physics on the evolution of ellipticals
by performing three-dimensional non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of the interactions
of active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets with the CGM including magnetic fields, and cosmic rays (CRs)
and their transport processes. We find that the physics of feedback operating on large galactic
scales depends very sensitively on plasma physics operating on small scales. Specifically, we
demonstrate that: (i) in the purely hydrodynamical case, the AGN jets initially maintain the atmospheres
in global thermal balance. However, local thermal instability generically leads to the formation
of massive cold disks in the vicinity of the central black hole in disagreement with observations;
(ii) including weak magnetic fields prevents the formation of the disks because local B-field amplification
in the precipitating cold gas leads to strong magnetic breaking, which quickly extracts angular
momentum from the accreting clouds. The magnetic fields transform the cold clouds into narrow filaments
that do not fall ballistically; (iii) when plasma composition in the AGN jets is dominated by CRs,
and CR transport is neglected, the atmospheres exhibit cooling catastrophes due to inefficient
heat transfer from the AGN to CGM despite Coulomb/hadronic CR losses being present; (iv) including
CR streaming and heating restores agreement with the observations, i.e., cooling catastrophes
are prevented and massive cold central disks do not form. The AGN power is reduced as its energy is
utilized efficiently.
