The effects of turbulence in the very local interstellar medium (VLISM) have been proposed by Giacalone
& Jokipii (2015) to be important in determining the structure of the Interstellar Boundary Explorer
(IBEX) ribbon via particle trapping by magnetic mirroring. We further explore this effect by simulating
the motion of charged particles in a turbulent magnetic field superposed on a large-scale mean field,
which we have considered to be either spatially-uniform or a mean field derived from a 3D MHD simulation.
We find that the ribbon is not double-peaked, in contrast to Giacalone & Jokipii (2015). However,
the magnetic mirror force still plays an important role in trapping particles. Furthermore, the
ribbon$'$s thickness is considerably larger if the large-scale mean field is draped around the
heliosphere. Voyager 1 observations in the VLISM show a turbulent field component that is stronger
than previously thought, which we test in our simulation. We find that the inclusion of turbulent
fluctuations at scales ${\gtrsim}$100 au and power consistent with Voyager 1 observations produces
a ribbon whose large-scale structure is inconsistent with IBEX observations. However, restricting
the fluctuations to ${\sim}$10 au or smaller produces a smoother ribbon structure similar to IBEX
observations. Different turbulence realizations produce different small-scale features ${\lesssim}10{\deg}$
in the ribbon, but its large-scale structure is robust if the maximum fluctuation size is ${\sim}$10
au. This suggests that the magnetic field structure at scales ${\lesssim}$10 au is determined by
the heliosphere$'$s interaction with the VLISM and cannot entirely be represented by homogeneous
interstellar turbulence.
