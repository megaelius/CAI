We construct a new analytic phenomenological model for the extended circumgalactic material (CGM)
of $L^*$ galaxies. Our model reproduces the OVII/OVIII absorption observations of the Milky Way
(MW) and the OVI measurements reported by the COS-Halos and eCGM surveys. The warm/hot gas is in hydrostatic
equilibrium in a MW gravitational potential, and we adopt a barotropic equation of state, resulting
in a temperature variation as a function of radius. A pressure component with an adiabatic index
of $\gamma=4/3$ is included to approximate the effects of a magnetic field and cosmic rays. We introduce
a metallicity gradient motivated by the enrichment of the inner CGM by the Galaxy. We then present
our fiducial model for the corona, tuned to reproduce the observed OVI-OVIII column densities,
and with a total mass of $M_{\rm gas} \approx 5.5 \times 10^{10}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ inside $r_{\rm
cgm} \approx 280$ kpc. The gas densities in the CGM are low ($n_{\rm H} = 10^{-5} - 3 \times 10^{-4}~{\rm
cm^{-3}}$) and its collisional ionization state is modified by the metagalactic radiation field
(MGRF). We show that for OVI-bearing warm/hot gas with typical observed column densities $N_{\rm
OVI} \sim 3 \times 10^{14}~{\rm cm^{-2}}$ at large ($\gtrsim 100$ kpc) impact parameters from the
central galaxies, the ratio of the cooling to dynamical times, $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm dyn}$, has
a model-independent upper limit of $\lesssim 4$. In our model, $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm dyn}$ at large
radii is $\sim 2-3$. We present predictions for a wide range of future observations of the warm/hot
CGM, from UV/X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy, to dispersion measure (DM) and Sunyaev-Zeldovich
CMB measurements. We provide the model outputs in machine-readable data files, for easy comparison
and analysis.
