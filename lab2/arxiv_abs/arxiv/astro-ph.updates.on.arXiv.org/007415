Understanding strong binary interactions is of wide astrophysical importance, and the deaths
of most stars in the Universe that evolve in a Hubble time could be fundamentally affected by such
interactions. These stars end their lives, evolving from Asymptotic Giant Branch stars with extensive
mass-loss into planetary nebulae with a spectacular array of morphologies. Binarity, and the associated
formation of accretion disks (that drive collimated, fast jets) during the very late AGB or early
post-AGB phase is believed to produce this dramatic morphological transformation. But the evidence
for binarity and accretion during the AGB phase has been hard to obtain due to observational limitations.
However, recent observations at UV and X-ray wavelengths have broken thru the observational barrier
-- our studies using GALEX reveal a candidate population of AGB stars, generally with strongly-variable
far-ultraviolet (FUV) emission (fuvAGB stars), and our follow-up studies with XMM-Newton, Chandra,
and HST of a few key objects supports our hypothesis that these objects have companions that are actively
accreting material from the primary. The most prominent fuvAGB star has been detected with the VLA,
showing the presence of variable non-thermal emission. The ngVLA, with its unprecedented sensitivity,
is needed to survey a statistical sample of fuvAGB stars over the ~3-90 Ghz range to search for and
characterize the nature of the radio emission from fuvAGB stars and test our binarity+accretion
hypothesis. Such a survey will distinguish between binarity/accretion-related radio emission
that is expected to have both thermal and non-thermal components and display significantly time-variable
on short time-scales (minutes to weeks), and single-star chromospheric emission from the primary
that is expected to be thermal, possibly with time-variability, but only on long time-scales (many
months to a year).
