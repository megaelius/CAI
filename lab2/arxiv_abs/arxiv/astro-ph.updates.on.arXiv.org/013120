Crater size-frequency distribution (CSFDs) measurements allow the derivation of absolute model
ages (AMAs) for geological units across various terrestrial bodies in the Solar System based on
body-specific adjustments to the lunar chronology (e.g., Hartmann, 1970; Neukum et al., 1975,
1983, 2001; Stoeffler et al., 2001, 2006; Hiesinger et al., 2012; Robbins, 2014). Thus, it is important
to revisit and test the accuracy of the lunar chronology using data from recent lunar missions (e.g.,
Hiesinger et al., 2000, 2012, 2015; Rajmon and Spudis, 2004; Stoeffler et al., 2006), as well as newer
analyses of lunar samples (e.g., Gaffney et al. 2011, Meyer, 2012; Snape et al., 2016; Welsh et al.,
2018). We generated a new detailed geological map of the Apollo 11 landing region based on spectral
characteristics, topography, and albedo maps, which shows several mare units adjacent to the lunar
module. Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) images were used to measure new CSFDs and derive
the cumulative number of craters with diameters greater than or equal to 1 km or N(1) for the Apollo
11 landing site. The newly derived N(1) values are consistent with the presence of only one surficial
unit at the landing site: the Group A, High-K (high potassium) young mare basalt (Meyer, 2012). We
reviewed the radiometric ages for Apollo 11 samples that have been determined since the calibration
of the lunar cratering chronology, used our new geological map to reinterpret their provenance,
and correlated them with the new N(1) values. These are plotted and compared with the lunar chronology
of Neukum et al. (1983). Our calibration point for the Apollo 11 landing site is consistent with the
earlier values, thus, confirming Neukum's (1983) lunar chronology curve.
