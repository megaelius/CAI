Aims: We present a detailed view of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) HESS J1825-137. We aim to constrain
the mechanisms dominating the particle transport within the nebula, accounting for its anomalously
large size and spectral characteristics. Methods: The nebula is studied using a deep exposure from
over 12 years of H.E.S.S. I operation, together with data from H.E.S.S. II improving the low energy
sensitivity. Enhanced energy-dependent morphological and spatially-resolved spectral analyses
probe the Very High Energy (VHE, E > 0.1 TeV) gamma-ray properties of the nebula. Results: The nebula
emission is revealed to extend out to 1.5 degrees from the pulsar, ~1.5 times further than previously
seen, making HESS J1825--137, with an intrinsic diameter of ~100 pc, potentially the largest gamma-ray
PWN currently known. Characterisation of the nebula's strongly energy-dependent morphology
enables the particle transport mechanisms to be constrained. A dependence of the nebula extent
with energy of R $\propto$ E^\alpha with \alpha = -0.29 +/- 0.04 (stat) +/- 0.05 (sys) disfavours
a pure diffusion scenario for particle transport within the nebula. The total gamma-ray flux of
the nebula above 1~TeV is found to be (1.12 +/- 0.03 (stat) +/- 0.25 (sys)) $\times 10^{-11}$ cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$, corresponding to ~64% of the flux of the Crab Nebula. Conclusions: HESS J1825-137 is a
PWN with clear energy-dependent morphology at VHE gamma-ray energies. This source is used as a laboratory
to investigate particle transport within middle-aged PWNe. Deep observations of this highly spatially-extended
PWN enable a spectral map of the region to be produced, providing insights into the spectral variation
within the nebula.
