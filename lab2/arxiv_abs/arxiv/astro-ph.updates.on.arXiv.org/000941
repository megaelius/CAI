We analyzed X-Shooter/VLT spectra of 24 ClassIII sources from three nearby star-forming regions
(sigmaOrionis, LupusIII, and TWHya). We determined the effective temperature, surface gravity,
rotational velocity, and radial velocity by comparing the observed spectra with synthetic BT-Settl
model spectra. We investigated in detail the emission lines emerging from the stellar chromospheres
and combined these data with archival X-ray data to allow for a comparison between chromospheric
and coronal emissions. Both X-ray and Halpha luminosity as measured in terms of the bolometric luminosity
are independent of the effective temperature for early-M stars but decline toward the end of the
spectral M sequence. For the saturated early-M stars the average emission level is almost one dex
higher for X-rays than for Halpha: log(L_x/L_bol) = -2.85 +- 0.36 vs. log(L_Halpha/L_bol) = -3.72
+- 0.21. When all chromospheric emission lines (including the Balmer series up to H11, CaII HK, the
CaII infrared triplet, and several HeI lines) are summed up the coronal flux still dominates that
of the chromosphere, typically by a factor 2-5. Flux-flux relations between activity diagnostics
that probe different atmospheric layers (from the lower chromosphere to the corona) separate our
sample of active pre-main sequence stars from the bulk of field M dwarfs studied in the literature.
Flux ratios between individual optical emission lines show a smooth dependence on the effective
temperature. The Balmer decrements can roughly be reproduced by an NLTE radiative transfer model
devised for another young star of similar age. Future, more complete chromospheric model grids
can be tested against this data set.
