The microlensing parallax campaign with the $Spitzer$ space telescope aims to measure masses and
distances of microlensing events seen towards the Galactic bulge, with a focus on planetary microlensing
events. The hope is to measure how the distribution of planets depends on position within the Galaxy.
In this paper, we compare 50 microlens parallax measurements from the 2015 $Spitzer$ campaign to
three different Galactic models commonly used in microlensing analyses, and we find that $\geq
80\,$\% of these events have microlensing parallax values higher than the medians predicted by
Galactic models. The Anderson-Darling and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests indicate probabilities
of $p_{\rm AD} < 3.0 \times 10^{-8}$ and $p_{\rm KS} < 4.1 \times 10^{-6}$ that the data are consistent
with these Galactic models, respectively. Given that many $Spitzer$ light curves show evidence
of large correlated errors, we conclude that this discrepancy is probably due to systematic errors
in the $Spitzer$ photometry. We find formally acceptable probabilities of $p_{\rm AD} > 0.05$ for
subsamples of events with bright source stars ($I_{\rm S} \leq 17.75$) or $Spitzer$ coverage of
the light curve peak. This indicates that the systematic errors have a more serious influence on
faint events, especially when the light curve peak is not covered by $Spitzer$. We find that multiplying
a renormalization factor of 3.4 by the reported error bars on the $Spitzer$ microlensing parallax
measurements provides reasonable agreement with all three Galactic models. However, corrections
to the uncertainties in the $Spitzer$ photometry itself are a more effective way to address the systematic
errors.
