The short GRB 170817A associated to the first detection of gravitation waves from a Binary Neutron
Star (BNS) merger was in many ways unusual. Possible explanations are emission from a cocoon or cocoon
break out, off-axis view of a structured or uniform jet, and on-axis ultra-relativistic jet with
reduced density and Lorentz factor. Here we use a phenomenological model of shock evolution and
synchrotron/self-Compton emission to simulate the prompt emission of GRB 170817A and to test above
proposals. We find that synchrotron emission from a mildly relativistic cocoon with a Lorentz factor
of 2-3, as considered in the literature, generates a too soft, too long, and too bright prompt emission.
Off-axis view of an structured jet with a Lorentz factor of about 10 can reproduce observations,
but needs a very efficient transfer of kinetic energy to electrons in internal shocks, which is disfavored
by particle in cell simulations. We also comment on cocoon breakout as a mechanism for generation
of the prompt gamma-ray. A relativistic jet with a Lorentz factor of about 100 and a density lower
than typical short GRBs seems to be the most plausible model and we conclude that GRB 170817A was intrinsically
faint. Based on this result and findings of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of
BNS merger in the literature we discuss physical and astronomical conditions, which may lead to
such faint short GRBs. We identify small mass difference of progenitor neutron stars, their old
age and reduced magnetic field, and anti-alignment of spin-orbit angular momentum induced by environmental
gravitational disturbances during the lifetime of the BNS as causes for the faintness of GRB 170817A.
We predict that BNS mergers at lower redshifts generate on average fainter GRBs.
