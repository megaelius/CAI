SPHEREx is a proposed NASA MIDEX mission selected for Phase A study. SPHEREx would carry out the first
all-sky spectral survey in the near infrared. At the end of its two-year mission, SPHEREx would obtain
0.75-to-5$\mu$m spectra of every 6.2 arcsec pixel on the sky, with spectral resolution R>35 and
a 5-$\sigma$ sensitivity AB$>$19 per spectral/spatial resolution element. More details concerning
SPHEREx are available at this http URL The SPHEREx team has proposed three specific science investigations
to be carried out with this unique data set: cosmic inflation, interstellar and circumstellar ices,
and the extra-galactic background light. Though these three themes are undoubtedly compelling,
they are far from exhausting the scientific output of SPHEREx. Indeed, SPHEREx would create a unique
all-sky spectral database including spectra of very large numbers of astronomical and solar system
targets, including both extended and diffuse sources. These spectra would enable a wide variety
of investigations, and the SPHEREx team is dedicated to making the data available to the community
to enable these investigations, which we refer to as Legacy Science. To that end, we have sponsored
two workshops for the general scientific community to identify the most interesting Legacy Science
themes and to ensure that the SPHEREx data products are responsive to their needs. In February of
2016, some 50 scientists from all fields met in Pasadena to develop these themes and to understand
their implications for the SPHEREx mission. The 2016 workshop highlighted many synergies between
SPHEREx and other contemporaneous astronomical missions, facilities, and databases. Consequently,
in January 2018 we convened a second workshop at the Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge to focus
specifically on these synergies. This white paper reports on the results of the 2018 SPHEREx workshop.
