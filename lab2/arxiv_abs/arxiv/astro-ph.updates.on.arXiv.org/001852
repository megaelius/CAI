The highest energy (contained) neutrino events in ICECUBE did provide within three years as many
as $35$ (tens-hundred TeV) energetic signals and additional $3$ rarest PeV cascades shower. Their
flux exceeded the atmospheric noise and favored the birth of a long waited extraterrestrial $\nu$
Astronomy. Indeed their flavor showed a fast revolutionary transition from $\nu_{\mu}$ atmospheric
rule at TeV toward a cascade ($\nu_{e}$,$\nu_{\tau}$) tracks at few tens TeV up to PeV energy. The
majority ($29$) of all these events are indeed spherical cascade shower and their exact timing in
shining provided an approximate $\nu$ arrival direction. However their map are inconclusive:
such a wide angle $\mp10^{\circ}$ spread signal, their paucity do not allow yet to define any meaning-full
source correlation. The rarest $9$ muon tracks did not offer any sharp clustering nor even any clear
overlapping within known sources. Larger sample of signals and a more accurate directionality
is needed. We recently suggested the highest energy (tens-TeV) muon crossing along the ICECUBE,
mostly at horizons or upcoming, as the ideal tool able to reveal soon such clustering or even any narrow
angle pointing to known (IR, X, Radio or $\gamma$) sources or self-correlation in rare doublet or
triplet: a hope for a meaningful $\nu$ Astronomy. Any unexpected smeared muons clustering along
galactic sources might be also signals of UHECR radioactive decay in flight. Within three years
of ICECUBE data all the un-contained crossing highest energy muons above few tens TeV maybe several
dozens, possibly around $60$, mostly enhanced along horizontal edges (but also reinforced in up-going
events) painting , known sources and-or self correlating in doublets or rarest triplet, solving
finally the UHE neutrino source puzzle.
