Alfvenic waves are ubiquitous in the solar atmosphere and their dissipation may play an important
role in atmospheric heating. In the partially ionized solar chromosphere, collisions between
ions and neutrals are an efficient dissipative mechanism for Alfven waves with frequencies near
the ion-neutral collision frequency. The collision frequency is proportional to the ion-neutral
collision cross section for momentum transfer. Here, we investigate Alfven wave damping as a function
of height in a simplified chromospheric model and compare the results for two sets of collision cross
sections, namely those of the classic hard-sphere model and those based on recent quantum-mechanical
computations. We find important differences between the results for the two sets of cross sections.
There is a critical interval of wavelengths for which impulsively excited Alfven waves are overdamped
as a result of the strong ion-neutral dissipation. The critical wavelengths are in the range from
1 km to 50 km for the hard-sphere cross sections, and from 1 m to 1 km for the quantum-mechanical cross
sections. Equivalently, for periodically driven Alfven waves there is an optimal frequency for
which the damping is most effective. The optimal frequency varies from 1 Hz to 10^2 Hz for the hard-sphere
cross sections, and from 10^2 Hz to 10^4 Hz for the quantum-mechanical cross sections. Future observations
at sufficiently high spatial or temporal resolution may show the importance of high-frequency
Alfven waves for chromospheric heating. For instance, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) may be able to detect the critical wavelengths and optimal frequencies and so to test
the effective collision cross section in the chromospheric plasma.
