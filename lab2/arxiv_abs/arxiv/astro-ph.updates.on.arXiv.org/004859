CO is commonly used as a tracer of the total gas mass in both the interstellar medium and in protoplanetary
disks. Recently there has been much debate about the utility of CO as a mass tracer in disks. Observations
of CO in protoplanetary disks reveal a range of CO abundances, with measurements of low CO to dust
mass ratios in numerous systems. One possibility is that carbon is removed from CO via chemistry.
However, the full range of physical conditions conducive to this chemical reprocessing is not well
understood. We perform a systematic survey of the time dependent chemistry in protoplanetary disks
for 198 models with a range of physical conditions. We varying dust grain size distribution, temperature,
comic ray and X-ray ionization rate, disk mass, and initial water abundance, detailing what physical
conditions are necessary to activate the various CO depletion mechanisms in the warm molecular
layer. We focus our analysis on the warm molecular layer in two regions: the outer disk (100 au) well
outside the CO snowline and the inner disk (19 au) just inside the midplane CO snow line. After 1 Myr,
we find that the majority of models have a CO abundance relative to H$_2$ less than $10^{-4}$ in the
outer disk, while an abundance less than $10^{-5}$ requires the presence of cosmic rays. Inside
the CO snow line, significant depletion of CO only occurs in models with a high cosmic ray rate. If
cosmic rays are not present in young disks it is difficult to chemically remove carbon from CO. Additionally,
removing water prior to CO depletion impedes the chemical processing of CO. Chemical processing
alone cannot explain current observations of low CO abundances. Other mechanisms must also be involved.
