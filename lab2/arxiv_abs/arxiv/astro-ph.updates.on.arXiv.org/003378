The compression property of regolith reflects the strength and porosity of the regolith layer on
small bodies and their variations in the layer that largely influence the collisional and thermal
evolution of the bodies. We conducted compression experiments and investigated the relationship
between the porosity and the compression using fluffy granular samples. We focused on a low-pressure
and high-porosity regime. We used tens of {\mu}m-sized irregular and spherical powders as analogs
of porous regolith. The initial porosity of the samples ranged from 0.80 to 0.53. The uniaxial pressure
applied to the samples lays in the range from 30 to 4x10^5 Pa. The porosity of the samples remained
at their initial values below a threshold pressure and then decreased when the pressure exceeded
the threshold. We defined this uniaxial pressure at the threshold as "yield strength". The yield
strength increased as the initial porosity of a sample decreased. The yield strengths of samples
consisting of irregular particles did not significantly depend on their size distributions when
the samples had the same initial porosity. We compared the results of our experiments with a previously
proposed theoretical model. We calculated the average interparticle force acting on contact points
of constituent particles under the uniaxial pressure of yield strength using the theoretical model
and compared it with theoretically estimated forces required to roll or slide the particles. The
calculated interparticle force was larger than the rolling friction force and smaller than the
sliding friction force. The yield strength of regolith may be constrained by these forces. Our results
may be useful for planetary scientists to estimate the depth above which the porosity of a regolith
layer is almost equal to that of the regolith surface and to interpret the compression property of
an asteroid surface obtained by a lander.
