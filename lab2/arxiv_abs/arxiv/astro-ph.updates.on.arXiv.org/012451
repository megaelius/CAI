Core-extremely red quasars (core-ERQ) have been proposed to represent an intermediate evolutionary
phase in which a heavily obscured quasar is blowing out the circumnuclear interstellar medium with
very energetic outflows prior to becoming an optical quasar. We revise the general UV and optical
emission line properties of core-ERQ in the context of the AGN orientation-based unification scenario.
We use diagnostic diagrams based on ultraviolet (UV) emission line ratios and UV-optical line kinematic
information to compare the physical and kinematic gas properties of core-ERQ with those of other
luminous narrow and broad line AGN. In particular, we provide a revised comparison of the [OIII]
kinematics in 21 core-ERQ with other samples of quasars matched in luminosity with the aim of evaluating
whether core-ERQ host the most extreme [OIII] outflows. The UV line ratios suggest that the physical
properties (for instance, density, metallicity) of the ionised gas in core-ERQ are similar to those
observed in the BLR of blue Nitrogen-loud QSOs. The [OIII] outflow velocities of core-ERQ are, on
average, consistent with those of very luminous blue QSO1, although extreme outflows are much more
frequent in core-ERQ. These similarities can be explained in the context of the AGN unification
model, assuming that core-ERQ are viewed with an intermediate orientation between type 2 (edge-on)
and type 1 (face-on) QSOs. We propose that core-ERQ are very luminous but otherwise normal quasars
viewed at an intermediate orientation. Such orientation allows a direct view of the outer part of
the large BLR, from which core-ERQ UV emission originates; the extreme [OIII] outflow velocities
are instead a consequence of the very high luminosity of core-ERQ.
