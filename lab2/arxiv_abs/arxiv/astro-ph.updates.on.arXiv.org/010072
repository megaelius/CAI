HERO (Highly Eccentric Relativity Orbiter) is a space-based mission concept aimed to perform several
tests of post-Newtonian gravity around the Earth with a preferably drag-free spacecraft moving
along a highly elliptical path fixed in its plane undergoing a relatively fast secular precession.
We considered two possible scenarios: a fast, 4-hr orbit with high perigee height of $1,047\,\mathrm{km}$,
and a slow, 21-hr path with a low perigee height of $642\,\mathrm{km}$. HERO may detect, for the first
time, the post-Newtonian orbital effects induced by the mass quadrupole moment $J_2$ of the Earth
which affects the semimajor axis $a$ via a secular trend of $\simeq 4-12\,\mathrm{cm\,yr}^{-1}$,
depending on the orbital configuration. Recently, the secular decay of the semimajor axis of the
passive satellite LARES was measured with an error as little as $0.7\,\mathrm{cm\,yr}^{-1}$.
Also the post-Newtonian spin dipole (Lense-Thirring) and mass monopole (Schwarzschild) effects
could be tested to a high accuracy depending on the level of compensation of the non-gravitational
perturbations. Moreover, the large eccentricity of the orbit would allow to constrain several
long-range modified models of gravity and to accurately measure the gravitational red-shift as
well. Each of the six Keplerian orbital elements could be individually monitored to extract the
$GJ_2/c^2$ signature, or they could be suitably combined in order to disentangle the post-Newtonian
effect(s) of interest from the competing mismodeled Newtonian secular precessions induced by
the zonal harmonic multipoles $J_\ell$ of the geopotential. In the latter case, the systematic
uncertainty due to the current formal errors $\sigma_{J_\ell}$ of a recent global Earth's gravity
field model are better than $1\%$ for all the post-Newtonian effects considered, with a peak of $\simeq
10^{-7}$ for the Schwarzschild-like shifts. [Abridged]
