The second Hi-C flight (Hi-C2.1) provided unprecedentedly-high spatial and temporal resolution
($\sim$250km, 4.4s) coronal EUV images of Fe IX/X emission at 172 \AA, of AR 12712 on 29-May-2018,
during 18:56:21-19:01:56 UT. Three morphologically-different types (I: dot-like, II: loop-like,
III: surge/jet-like) of fine-scale sudden-brightening events (tiny microflares) are seen within
and at the ends of an arch filament system in the core of the AR. Although type Is (not reported before)
resemble IRIS-bombs (in size, and brightness wrt surroundings), our dot-like events are apparently
much hotter, and shorter in span (70s). We complement the 5-minute-duration Hi-C2.1 data with SDO/HMI
magnetograms, SDO/AIA EUV images, and IRIS UV spectra and slit-jaw images to examine, at the sites
of these events, brightenings and flows in the transition-region and corona and evolution of magnetic
flux in the photosphere. Most, if not all, of the events are seated at sites of opposite-polarity
magnetic flux convergence (sometimes driven by adjacent flux emergence), implying likely flux
cancellation at the microflare's polarity inversion line. In the IRIS spectra and images, we find
confirming evidence of field-aligned outflow from brightenings at the ends of loops of the arch
filament system. In types I and II the explosion is confined, while in type III the explosion is ejective
and drives jet-like outflow. The light-curves from Hi-C, AIA and IRIS peak nearly simultaneously
for many of these events and none of the events display a systematic cooling sequence as seen in typical
coronal flares, suggesting that these tiny brightening-events have chromospheric/transition-region
origin.
