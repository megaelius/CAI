We present the North Galactic Cap sample of the Extremely Luminous Quasar Survey (ELQS-N), which
targets quasars with $M_{1450}<-27$ at $2.8 \leq z < 5$ in an area of $\sim7600\,\rm{deg}^2$ of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) footprint with $90\,\rm{deg}<\rm{RA}<270\,\rm{deg}$. Based
on a near-infrared/infrared JKW2 color cut, the ELQS selection efficiently uses random forest
methods to classify quasars and to estimate photometric redshifts; this scheme overcomes some
of the difficulties of pure optical quasar selection at $z\approx3$. As a result, we retain a completeness
of $>70\%$ over $z\sim3.0-5.0$ at $m_{\rm{i}}\lesssim17.5$, limited towards fainter magnitudes
by the depth of the Two Micron Allsky Survey (2MASS). The presented quasar catalog comprises a total
of 270 objects, of which 39 are newly identified in this work with spectroscopy obtained at the Vatican
Advanced Technology Telescope and the MMT $6.5\,\rm{m}$ telescope. In addition to the high completeness,
which allowed us to discover new quasars in the already well-surveyed SDSS North Galactic Cap, the
efficiency of our selection is relatively high at $\sim79\%$. Using 120 objects of this quasar sample
we are able to extend the previously measured optical quasar luminosity function (QLF) by one magnitude
toward the bright end at $2.8 \leq z \leq 4.5$. A first analysis of the QLF suggests a relatively steep
bright end slope of $\beta\approx-4$ for this sample. This result contrasts with previous results
in the same redshift range, which find a much flatter slope around $\beta\sim-2.5$, but agrees with
recent measurements of the bright end slope at lower and higher redshifts. Our results constrain
the bright end slope at $z=2.8-4.5$ to $\beta<-2.94$ with a $95\%$ confidence.
