Exoplanets mass measurements will be a critical next step to assess the habitability of Earth-like
planets: a key aspect of the 2020 vision in the previous decadal survey and also central to NASA's
strategic priorities. Precision astrometry delivers measurement of exoplanet masses, allowing
discrimination of rocky planets from water worlds and enabling much better modeling of their atmosphere
improving species retrieval from spectroscopy. The scientific potential of astrometry will be
enormous. The intrinsic astrophysical noise floor set by star spots and stellar surface activity
is about a factor of ten more benign for astrometry than for the more established technique of Radial
Velocity, widening the discovery region and pushing detection thresholds to lower masses than
previously possible. On the instrumental side, precision astrometry is limited by optical field
distortion and detector calibration issues. Both technical challenges are now being addressed
successfully in the laboratory. However, we have identified the need to continue these technology
development efforts to achieve sub-microarcsecond astrometry precision necessary for detection
and characterization of Earth-like planets around nearby FGK stars. The international community
has realized the importance of astrometry, and various astrometry missions have been proposed
and under development, with a few high profile missions now operational. We believe that it is vital
for the U.S. scientific community to participate in the development of these new technologies and
scientific discoveries. We recommend exploring alternatives to incorporate astrometric capabilities
into future exoplanet flagship missions such as HABEX and LUVOIR, substantially increasing the
scientific return associated with the expected yield of earth-like planets to be recovered.
