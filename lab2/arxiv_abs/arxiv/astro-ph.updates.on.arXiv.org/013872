The petroleum and coal models of the unidentified infrared emissions (UIE), sometimes referred
also as unidentified infrared bands (UIBs) has been reviewed mainly based on the work of the authors
with the inclusion of unpublished results. It is shown that the petroleum and coal model of the UIE
converges and merges quite well with the MAON (Mixed Aromatic Aliphatic Organic Nanoparticles)
model of the UIE. It is shown that the thermal treatment of various substrates like PAHs, alkylated
PAHs but also mixed aliphatic/olefinic substrates leads invariable to carbonaceous materials
matching the infrared spectrum of anthracite coal or certain petroleum fractions. Thus, the experimental
thermal processing (which under space conditions could be equivalent to the expected processing
by shock waves or high energy radiation) of mixed aromatic/aliphatic organic matter can be used
to match also the UIE evolution. Another way to simulate the thermal/radiation processing of organic
matter in space, can be achieved through the carbon arc. Simple substrates processed in this way
produce carbon soot and a plethora of organic molecules. Fullerenes are found in space both through
mid-infrared and optical spectroscopy and it is very likely that other complex related species
such as endohedral fullerenes (i.e. fullerenes with a metal, heteroatom or molecules inside the
cage) may be formed in space. After all, their formation requires the same conditions as those needed
for fullerene formation provided that also a metal vapour (e.g. interstellar/circumstellar gas)
is available. The last part of this review is thus dedicated to the recent results on the study and
characterization of an endohedral C60 derivative containing lithium inside the cage.
