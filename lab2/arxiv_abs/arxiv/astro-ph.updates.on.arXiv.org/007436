We present predictions for the gravitational-wave (GW) emission of three-dimensional supernova
(SN) simulations performed for a 15 solar-mass progenitor with the Prometheus-Vertex code using
energy-dependent, three-flavor neutrino transport. The progenitor adopted from stellar evolution
calculations including magnetic fields had a fairly low specific angular momentum (j_Fe <~ 10^{15}
cm^2/s) in the iron core (central angular velocity ~0.2 rad/s), which we compared to simulations
without rotation and with artificially enhanced rotation (j_Fe <~ 2*10^{16} cm^2/s; central angular
velocity ~0.5 rad/s). Our results confirm that the time-domain GW signals of SNe are stochastic,
but possess deterministic components with characteristic patterns at low frequencies (<~200
Hz), caused by mass motions due to the standing accretion shock instability (SASI), and at high frequencies,
associated with gravity-mode oscillations in the surface layer of the proto-neutron star (PNS).
Non-radial mass motions in the post-shock layer as well as PNS convection are important triggers
of GW emission, whose amplitude scales with the power of the hydrodynamic flows. There is no monotonic
increase of the GW amplitude with rotation, but a clear correlation with the strength of SASI activity.
Our slowly rotating model is a fainter GW emitter than the non-rotating model because of weaker SASI
activity and damped convection in the post-shock layer and PNS. In contrast, the faster rotating
model exhibits a powerful SASI spiral mode during its transition to explosion, producing the highest
GW amplitudes with a distinctive drift of the low-frequency emission peak from ~80-100 Hz to ~40-50
Hz. This migration signifies shock expansion, whereas non-exploding models are discriminated
by the opposite trend.
