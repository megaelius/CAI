We investigate the relation between characteristics of coronal mass ejections and parameterizations
of the eruptive capability of solar active regions widely used in solar flare prediction schemes.
These parameters, some of which are explored for the first time, are properties related to topological
features, namely, magnetic polarity inversion lines (MPILs) that indicate large amounts of stored
non-potential (i.e. free) magnetic energy. We utilize the Space Weather Database of Notifications,
Knowledge, Information (DONKI) and the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronograph (LASCO) databases
to find flare-associated coronal mass ejections and their kinematic characteristics while properties
of MPILs are extracted from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) vector magnetic-field observations
of active regions to extract the properties of source-region MPILs. The correlation between all
properties and the characteristics of CMEs ranges from moderate to very strong. More significant
correlations hold particularly for fast CMEs, which are most important in terms of adverse space-weather
manifestations. Non-neutralized currents and the length of the main MPIL exhibit significantly
stronger correlations than the rest of the properties. This finding supports a causal relationship
between coronal mass ejections and non-neutralized electric currents in highly sheared, conspicuous
MPILs. In addition, non-neutralized currents and MPIL length carry distinct, independent information
as to the eruptive potential of active regions. The combined total amount of non-neutralized electric
currents and the length of the main polarity inversion line, therefore, reflect more efficiently
than other parameters the eruptive capacity of solar active regions and the CME kinematic characteristics
stemming from these regions.
