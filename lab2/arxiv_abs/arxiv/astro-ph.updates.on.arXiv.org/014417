In recent years forecasting activities have become a very important tool for designing and optimising
large scale structure surveys. To predict the performance of such surveys, the Fisher matrix formalism
is frequently used as a fast and easy way to compute constraints on cosmological parameters. Among
them lies the study of the properties of dark energy which is one of the main goals in modern cosmology.
As so, a metric for the power of a survey to constrain dark energy is provided by the Figure of merit
(FoM). This is defined as the inverse of the surface contour given by the joint variance of the dark
energy equation of state parameters $\{w_0,w_a\}$ in the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterisation,
which can be evaluated from the covariance matrix of the parameters. This covariance matrix is obtained
as the inverse of the Fisher matrix. Inversion of an ill-conditioned matrix can result in large errors
on the covariance coefficients if the elements of the Fisher matrix have been estimated with insufficient
precision. The conditioning number is a metric providing a mathematical lower limit to the required
precision for a reliable inversion, but it is often too stringent in practice for Fisher matrices
with size larger than $2\times2$. In this paper we propose a general numerical method to guarantee
a certain precision on the inferred constraints, like the FoM. It consists on randomly vibrating
(perturbing) the Fisher matrix elements with Gaussian perturbations of a given amplitude, and
then evaluating the maximum amplitude that keeps the FoM within the chosen precision. The steps
used in the numerical derivatives and integrals involved in the calculation of the Fisher matrix
elements can then be chosen accordingly in order to keep the precision of the Fisher matrix elements
below this maximum amplitude...
