B-type stars are known to rotate at various velocities, including very fast rotators near the critical
velocity as the Be stars. In this paper, we provide stellar models covering the mass range between
1.7 to 15 Msun, which includes the typical mass of known Be stars, at Z = 0.014, 0.006, and 0.002 and
for an extended range of initial velocities on the zero-age main sequence. We used the Geneva stellar-evolution
code, including the effects of shellular rotation, with a numerical treatment that has been improved
so the code can precisely track the variation in the angular momentum content of the star as it changes
under the influence of radiative winds and/or mechanical mass loss. We discuss the impact of the
initial rotation rate on the tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, the main-sequence (MS)
lifetimes, the evolution of the surface rotation and abundances, as well as on the ejected masses
of various isotopes. Among the new results obtained from the present grid we find that 1) fast-rotating
stars with initial masses around 1.7 Msun present at the beginning of the core hydrogen-burning
phase quite small convective cores with respect to their slowly rotating counterparts. This fact
may be interesting to keep in mind in the framework of the asteroseismic studies of such stars. 2)
The contrast between the core and surface angular velocity is higher in slower rotating stars. The
values presently obtained are in agreement with the very few values obtained for B-type stars from
asteroseismology. 3) At Z = 0.002, the stars in the mass range of 1.7 to 3 Msun with a mean velocity on
the MS of the order of 150 km/s show N/H enhancement superior to 0.2 dex at mid-MS, and superior to 0.4
dex at the end of the MS phase. At solar metallicity the corresponding values are below 0.2 dex at any
time in the MS.
