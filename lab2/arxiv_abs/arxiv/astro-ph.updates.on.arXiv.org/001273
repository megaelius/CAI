Two recent discoveries have made it possible for us to begin using high-z quasars as standard candles
to construct a Hubble Diagram (HD) at z > 6. These are (1) the recognition from reverberation mapping
that a relationship exists between the optical/UV luminosity and the distance of line-emitting
gas from the central ionizing source. Thus, together with a measurement of the velocity of the line-emitting
gas, e.g., via the width of BLR lines, such as Mg II, a single observation can therefore in principle
provide a determination of the black hole's mass; and (2) the identification of quasar ULAS J1120+0641
at z = 7.085, which has significantly extended the redshift range of these sources, providing essential
leverage when fitting theoretical luminosity distances to the data. In this paper, we use the observed
fluxes and Mg II line-widths of these sources to show that one may reasonably test the predicted high-z
distance versus redshift relationship, and we assemble a sample of 20 currently available high-z
quasars for this exercise. We find a good match between theory and observations, suggesting that
a more complete, high-quality survey may indeed eventually produce an HD to complement the highly-detailed
study already underway (e.g., with Type Ia SNe, GRBs, and cosmic chronometers) at lower redshifts.
With the modest sample we have here, we show that the R_h=ct Universe and LCDM both fit the data quite
well, though the smaller number of free parameters in the former produces a more favorable outcome
when we calculate likelihoods using the Akaike, Kullback, and Bayes Information Criteria. These
three statistical tools result in similar probabilities, indicating that the R_h=ct Universe
is more likely than LCDM to be correct, by a ratio of about 85% to 15%.
