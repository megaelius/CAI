We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) absolute proper motion (PM) measurements for 20 globular
cluster (GCs) in the Milky Way (MW) halo spanning a Galactocentric distance (R_GC) range from ~10
to 100 kpc. Our median 1d PM uncertainty is 0.06 mas/yr. We derive Galactocentric space velocity
vectors of the target GCs by combining our newly-measured PMs with existing line-of-sight velocities.
The young and old halo GCs do not show systematic differences in space velocities, but we find a clear
dichotomy in the tangential velocity (v_tan) distribution with Sgr clusters (Arp 2, Pal 12, Terzan
7, and Terzan 8) and NGC 6101 having v_tan > 290 km/s, whereas all other clusters have v_tan < 200 km/s.
We confirm the Sgr associations for the four clusters, and rule out associations for NGC 4147, NGC
5024, and NGC 5053 with high confidence. The most distant GC in our sample, NGC 2419 is also most likely
associated with the Sgr stream based on our PM results, but with an offset in the transverse direction
with respect to the stream path. We derive orbital parameters using the newly measured PMs. We use
the distribution of orbital parameters to separate halo GCs that either formed in situ or were accreted,
and to assess the specific formation history of e.g. Pyxis and Terzan 8. We constrain the MW mass via
a tracer mass estimator that considers the full 6d phase-space information. To represent the full
MW halo population from R_GC = 10 to 40 kpc, we select a subsample of 16 GCs (excluding the distant NGC
2419, and including only one of the four Sgr GCs). The velocity dispersion anisotropy parameter
is $\beta$ = 0.609 [+0.130,-0.229]. We estimate the mass within R = 39.5 kpc to be M(<39.5kpc) = 0.60
[+0.17,-0.11] $\times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. The implied virial mass is M_vir=1.87 [+0.67,-0.47]
$\times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$, consistent with, but on the high side among recent mass estimates in
the literature.
