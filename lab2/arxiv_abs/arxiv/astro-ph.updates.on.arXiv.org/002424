We present results of cosmological N-body hydrodynamic chemistry simulations of primordial structure
growth and evolution in a scenario with warm dark matter (WDM) having a mass of 3keV and compare with
a model consisting of standard cold dark matter (CDM). We focus on the high-redshift universe ($z>6$),
where the structure formation process should better reflect the primordial (linear) differences
in terms of matter power spectrum. We find that early epochs are exceptional probes of the dark-matter
nature. Non-linear CDM and WDM power spectra differ by up to 2 dex at early times and show spreads of
factor of a few persisting in the whole first Gyr. Primordial WDM objects with masses $\lesssim 10^8\,\rm
M_\odot$ are less abundant by $\gtrsim 1\,\rm dex$, both in terms of dark matter and of baryon content.
Runaway molecular cooling in primordial WDM mini-haloes results severely inhibited due to the
damping of power at large $k$ modes. As a consequence, the cosmic (population III and II-I) star formation
activity is usually suppressed with respect to CDM predictions and this makes hard to form stars
and proto-galaxies in WDM haloes before $z\sim 15$. Observable luminous objects formed in a WDM
background should be very rare at $z>10$, hence, future determinations of statistical properties
of early faint galaxies could be extremely useful to discriminate between CDM and WDM. When compared
to the effects of alternative cosmologies (e.g. non-Gaussian or dark-energy models) or of high-order
corrections at large $z$ (e.g. primordial streaming motions or changes in the pristine IMF) the
ones caused by WDM are definitely more dramatic. The lack of WDM haloes during the dark ages has strong
implications on the onset of reionization and cosmic heating, due to the sparser and retarded evolution
of HI brightness temperatures in a WDM universe.
