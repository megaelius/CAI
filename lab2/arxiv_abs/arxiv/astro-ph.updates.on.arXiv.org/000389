CO and dust emission at millimeter wavelengths are independent tracers of cold interstellar matter,
which have seldom been compared on the scale of GMCs in other galaxies. In this study, and for the first
time in the Large Magellanic Cloud, we compute the molecular cloud masses from the mm emission of
the dust and compare them with the masses derived from their CO luminosity and virial theorem. We
present CO (J=1-0,2-1) and 1.2 mm continuum observations of the N11 star forming region in the LMC
obtained with the SEST telescope and the SIMBA bolometer, respectively. We use the CO data to identify
individual molecular clouds and measure their physical properties. The correlations between
the properties of the N11 clouds are in agreement with those found in earlier studies in the LMC that
sample a larger set of clouds and a larger range of cloud masses. For the N11 molecular clouds, we compare
the masses estimated from the CO luminosity (Xco\Lco), the virial theorem (Mvir) and the millimeter
dust luminosity (L_d). The measured ratios Lco/Mvir and L_d/Mvir constrain the Xco and K_d (dust
emissivity at 1.2 mm per unit gas mass) parameters as a function of the virial parameter a_vir. The
comparison between the different mass estimates yields a Xco-factor of 8.8x10^20 cm-2/(K km s-1)
x a_vir and a K_d parameter of 1.5x10^-3 cm2/g x a_vir. We compare our N11 results with a similar analysis
for molecular clouds in the Gould's Belt. We do not find in N11 a large discrepancy between the dust
mm and virial masses as reported in earlier studies of molecular clouds in the SMC. The ratio between
L_d and Mvir in N11 is half of that measured for Gould's Belt clouds, which can be accounted for by a
factor of two lower gas-to-dust mass ratio, as the difference in gas metallicities. If the two samples
have similar a_vir values, this result implies that their dust far-IR properties are also similar.
