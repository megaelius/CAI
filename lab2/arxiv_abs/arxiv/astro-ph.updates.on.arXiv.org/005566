We present an X-ray point-source catalog from the XMM-Large Scale Structure survey region (XMM-LSS),
one of the XMM-Spitzer Extragalactic Representative Volume Survey (XMM-SERVS) fields. We target
the XMM-LSS region with $1.3$ Ms of new XMM-Newton AO-15 observations, transforming the archival
X-ray coverage in this region into a 5.3 deg$^2$ contiguous field with uniform X-ray coverage totaling
$2.7$ Ms of flare-filtered exposure, with a $46$ ks median PN exposure time. We provide an X-ray catalog
of 5242 sources detected in the soft (0.5-2 keV), hard (2-10 keV), and/or full (0.5-10 keV) bands
with a 1% expected spurious fraction determined from simulations. A total of 2381 new X-ray sources
are detected compared to previous source catalogs in the same area. Our survey has flux limits of
$1.7\times10^{-15}$, $1.3\times10^{-14}$, and $6.5\times10^{-15}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$
over 90% of its area in the soft, hard, and full bands, respectively, which is comparable to those
of the XMM-COSMOS survey. We identify multiwavelength counterpart candidates for 99.9% of the
X-ray sources, of which 93% are considered as reliable based on their matching likelihood ratios.
The reliabilities of these high-likelihood-ratio counterparts are further confirmed to be $\approx
97$% reliable based on deep Chandra coverage over $\approx 5$% of the XMM-LSS region. Results of
multiwavelength identifications are also included in the source catalog, along with basic optical-to-infrared
photometry and spectroscopic redshifts from publicly available surveys. We compute photometric
redshifts for X-ray sources in 4.5 deg$^2$ of our field where forced-aperture multi-band photometry
is available; $>70$% of the X-ray sources in this subfield have either spectroscopic or high-quality
photometric redshifts.
