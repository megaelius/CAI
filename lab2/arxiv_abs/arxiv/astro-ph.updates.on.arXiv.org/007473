Large-scale galactic shocks, predicted by density wave theory, trigger star formation (SF-arms)
downstream from the potential of the oldest stars (P-arms), resulting in a color jump from red to
blue across spiral arms in the direction of rotation, while aging of these newly formed young stars
induces the opposite but coexisting classic age gradient further downstream from the SF-arms.
As the techniques for measuring pitch angle are intensity-weighted, they trace both the SF-arms
and P-arms and are not sensitive to the classic age gradient. Consequently, the measured pitch angle
of spiral arms should be systematically smaller in bluer bandpasses compared to redder bandpasses.
We test these predictions using a comprehensive sample of high-quality optical ($BVRI$) images
of bright, nearby spiral galaxies acquired as part of the Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey, supplemented
by $Spitzer$ 3.6 $\mu m$ data to probe evolved stars and $GALEX$ ultraviolet images to trace recent
star formation. We apply one-dimensional and two-dimensional techniques to measure the pitch
angle of spiral arms, paying close attention to adopt consistent procedures across the different
bandpasses to minimize error and systematic bias. We find that the pitch angle of spiral arms decreases
mildly but statistically significantly from the reddest to the bluest bandpass, demonstrating
conclusively that young stars trace tighter spiral arms than old stars. Furthermore, the correlation
between the pitch angle of blue and red bandpasses is non-linear, such that the absolute value of
pitch angle offset increases with increasing pitch angle. Both effects can be naturally explained
in the context of the density wave theory for spiral structure.
