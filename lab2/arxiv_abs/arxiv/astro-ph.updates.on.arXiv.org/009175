To date, infrared interferometry at best achieved contrast ratios of a few times $10^{-4}$ on bright
targets. GRAVITY, with its dual-field mode, is now capable of high contrast observations, enabling
the direct observation of exoplanets. We demonstrate the technique on HR8799, a young planetary
system composed of four known giant exoplanets. We used the GRAVITY fringe tracker to lock the fringes
on the central star, and integrated off-axis on the HR8799e planet situated at 390 mas from the star.
Data reduction included post-processing to remove the flux leaking from the central star and to
extract the coherent flux of the planet. The inferred K band spectrum of the planet has a spectral
resolution of 500. We also derive the astrometric position of the planet relative to the star with
a precision on the order of 100$\,\mu$as. The GRAVITY astrometric measurement disfavors perfectly
coplanar stable orbital solutions. A small adjustment of a few degrees to the orbital inclination
of HR 8799 e can resolve the tension, implying that the orbits are close to, but not strictly coplanar.
The spectrum, with a signal-to-noise ratio of $\approx 5$ per spectral channel, is compatible with
a late-type L brown dwarf. Using Exo-REM synthetic spectra, we derive a temperature of $1150\pm50$\,K
and a surface gravity of $10^{4.3\pm0.3}\,$cm/s$^{2}$. This corresponds to a radius of $1.17^{+0.13}_{-0.11}\,R_{\rm
Jup}$ and a mass of $10^{+7}_{-4}\,M_{\rm Jup}$, which is an independent confirmation of mass estimates
from evolutionary models. Our results demonstrate the power of interferometry for the direct detection
and spectroscopic study of exoplanets at close angular separations from their stars.
