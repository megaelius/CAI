I suggest a novel approach for deriving evolution equations for rapidly rotating relativistic
stars affected by radiation-driven Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz (CFS) instability. This
approach is based on the multipolar expansion of gravitational wave emission and appeals to the
global physical properties of the star (energy, angular momentum, and thermal state), but not to
canonical energy and angular momentum, which is traditional. It leads to simple derivation of the
CFS instability criterion for normal modes and the evolution equations for a star, affected by this
instability. The approach also gives a precise form to simple explanation of the CFS instability:
it occurs when two conditions met: (a) gravitational wave emission removes angular momentum from
the rotating star (thus releasing the rotation energy) and (b) gravitational waves carry less energy,
than the released amount of the rotation energy. Results are illustrated by r-mode instability
in slowly rotating Newtonian stars. In resulting evolution equations emission of gravitational
waves directly affects the spin frequency, being in line with the arguments by Levin & Ushomirsky
(2001), but in contrast to widely accepted equations by Lindblom et al. (1998); Ho & Lai (2000), there
effective spin frequency decrease is coupled with dissipation of unstable mode. This problem,
initially stressed by Levin & Ushomirsky (2001), is shown to be superficial, and arises as a result
of definition of the effective spin frequency by Lindblom et al. (1998); Ho & Lai (2000). Namely,
it is shown, that if this definition is taken into account properly, the evolution equations coincide
with obtained here in the leading order in mode amplitude. I also argue that the next-to-leading
order terms in evolution equations (which differ for Owen et al. 1998 and Ho & Lai 2000) require clarification
and thus it would be more self-consistent to omit them.
