Self-consistent model grids of brown dwarfs involve complex physics and chemistry, and are often
computed using proprietary computer codes, making it challenging to identify the reasons for discrepancies
between model and data as well as between the models produced by different research groups. In the
current study, we demonstrate a novel method for analyzing brown dwarf spectra, which combines
the use of the Sonora, AMES-Cond and HELIOS model grids with the supervised machine learning method
of the random forest. Besides performing atmospheric retrieval, the random forest enables information
content analysis of the three model grids as a natural outcome of the method, both individually on
each grid and by comparing the grids against one another, via computing large suites of mock retrievals.
Our analysis reveals that the different choices made in modelling the alkali line shapes hinder
the use of the alkali lines as gravity indicators. Nevertheless, the spectrum longward of 1.2 micron
encodes enough information on the surface gravity to allow its inference from retrieval. Temperature
may be accurately and precisely inferred independent of the choice of model grid, but not the surface
gravity. We apply random forest retrieval to three objects: the benchmark T7.5 brown dwarf GJ 570D;
and Epsilon Indi Ba (T1.5 brown dwarf) and Bb (T6 brown dwarf), which are part of a binary system and
have measured dynamical masses. For GJ 570D, the inferred effective temperature and surface gravity
are consistent with previous studies. For Epsilon Indi Ba and Bb, the inferred surface gravities
are broadly consistent with the values informed by the dynamical masses.
