We apply the general relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics code BHAC to perform a 2D study
of the formation and evolution of a reconnection layer in between two merging magnetic flux tubes
in Minkowski spacetime. Small-scale effects in the regime of low resistivity most relevant for
dilute astrophysical plasmas are resolved with very high accuracy due to the extreme resolutions
obtained with adaptive mesh refinement. Numerical convergence in the highly nonlinear plasmoid-dominated
regime is confirmed for a sweep of resolutions. We employ both uniform resistivity and spatiotemporally
dependent resistivity based on the local, instantaneous current density. For uniform resistivity
we find Sweet-Parker reconnection, from $\eta = 10^{-2}$ down to $\eta = 10^{-4}$, for a fiducial
case of magnetisation $\sigma = 3.33$ and plasma-$\beta = 0.1$. For a uniform resistivity of $\eta=5\times10^{-5}$,
the ideal tearing mode is recovered, where the fastest growing mode becomes independent of the Lundquist
number. The ideal tearing mode triggers the plasmoid instability, enhancing the reconnection
rate to $v_{rec} \sim 0.03c$ compared to $v_{rec} \sim 0.01c$ for $\eta=10^{-4}$. For a non-uniform
resistivity with a base level $\eta_0 = 10^{-4}$ and an enhanced current-dependent resistivity
in the current sheet, we find an increased reconnection rate of $v_{rec} \sim 0.1c$. The influence
of the magnetisation $\sigma$ of the plasma and the plasma-$\beta$ is analysed for the fiducial
cases with uniform resistivity $\eta=5\times10^{-5}$ and $\eta=10^{-4}$ for a range of $0.5 \leq
\sigma \leq 10$ and $0.01 \leq \beta \leq 1$ in regimes that are applicable for black hole accretion
disks and jets. The plasmoid instability is triggered for Lundquist numbers larger than a critical
value of $S_c \gtrsim 7400$.
