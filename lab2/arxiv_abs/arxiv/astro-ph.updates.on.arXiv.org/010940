We use state of the art hydrodyamical simulations from the Sherwood, EAGLE and Illustris projects
to examine the signature of $M_{\rm z=0}\simeq 10^{14}M_{\odot}$ protoclusters observed in Ly-$\alpha$
absorption at $z\simeq 2.4$. We find there is a weak correlation between the mass overdensity, $\delta_{\rm
m}$, and the Ly-$\alpha$ effective optical depth relative to the mean, $\delta_{\tau_\textrm{eff}}$,
averaged over $15~h^{-1}\rm\,cMpc$ scales, although scatter in the $\delta_{\rm m}$--$\delta_{\tau_\textrm{eff}}$
plane means it is not possible to uniquely identify large scale overdensities with strong Ly-$\alpha$
absorption. Although all protoclusters are associated with large scale mass overdensities, most
sight lines through protoclusters in a $\sim 10^{6}$ $\rm cMpc^{3}$ volume probe the low column
density Ly-$\alpha$ forest. A small subset of sight lines that pass through protoclusters exhibit
coherent, strong Ly-$\alpha$ absorption on $15h^{-1}\rm\,cMpc$ scales, although these correspond
to a wide range in mass overdensity. Assuming perfect removal of contamination by Ly-$\alpha$ absorbers
with damping wings, more than half of the remaining sight lines with $\delta_{\tau_{\rm eff}}>3.5$
trace protoclusters. It is furthermore possible to identify a model dependent $\delta_{\tau_{\rm
eff}}$ threshold that selects only protoclusters. However, such regions are rare: excluding absorption
caused by damped systems, less than 0.1 per cent of sight lines that pass through a protocluster have
$\delta_{\tau_{\rm eff}}>3.5$, meaning that any protocluster sample selected in this manner
will also be highly incomplete. On the other hand, coherent regions of Ly-$\alpha$ absorption also
provide a promising route for identifying and studying filamentary environments at high redshift.
