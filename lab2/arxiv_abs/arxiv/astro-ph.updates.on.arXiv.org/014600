Context. Direct imaging provides a steady flow of newly discovered giant planets and brown dwarf
companions. These multi-object systems can provide information about the formation of low-mass
companions in wide orbits and/or help us to speculate about possible migration scenarios. Accurate
classification of companions is crucial for testing formation pathways. Aims. In this work we further
characterise the recently discovered candidate for a planetary-mass companion CS Cha b and determine
if it is still accreting. Methods. MUSE is a four-laser-adaptive-optics-assisted medium-resolution
integral-field spectrograph in the optical part of the spectrum. We observed the CS Cha system to
obtain the first spectrum of CS Cha b. The companion is characterised by modelling both the spectrum
from 6300 $\unicode{x212B}$ to 9300 $\unicode{x212B}$ and the photometry using archival data
from the visible to the near-infrared (NIR). Results. We find evidence of accretion and outflow
signatures in H$\mathrm{\alpha}$ and OI emission. The atmospheric models with the highest likelihood
indicate an effective temperature of $3450\pm50$ K with a $\log{g}$ of $3.6\pm0.5$ dex. Based on
evolutionary models, we find that the majority of the object is obscured. We determine the mass of
the faint companion with several methods to be between 0.07 $M_{\odot}$ and 0.71 $M_{\odot}$ with
an accretion rate of $\dot{M} = 4 \times 10^{-11 \pm 0.4}$ Myr$^{-1}$. Conclusions. Our results
show that CS Cha B is most likely a mid-M-type star that is obscured by a highly inclined disc, which
has led to its previous classification using broadband NIR photometry as a planetary-mass companion.
This shows that it is important and necessary to observe over a broad spectral range to constrain
the nature of faint companions
