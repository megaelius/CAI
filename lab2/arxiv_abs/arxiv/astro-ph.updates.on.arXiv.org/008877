To trace chemical evolution in a prototypical starburst environment, we spatially resolve the
carbon and oxygen isotope ratios across the central molecular zone (full size ~$\sim 600$ pc) in
the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253. We imaged the emission of the optically thin isotopologues
$^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, C$^{17}$O, $^{13}$C$^{18}$O at a spatial resolution $\sim50$ pc, comparable
to the typical size of giant molecular associations. Optical depth effects and contamination of
$^{13}$C$^{18}$O by C$_4$H is discussed and accounted for to derive column densities. This is the
first extragalactic detection of the double isotopologue $^{13}$C$^{18}$O. Derived isotopic
ratios $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C$\sim21\pm6$, $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O$\sim130\pm40$, and $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O$\sim4.5\pm0.8$
differ from the generally adopted values in the nuclei of galaxies. The molecular clouds in the central
region of NGC 253 show similar rare isotope enrichment to those within the central molecular zone
of the Milky way. This enrichment is attributed to stellar nucleosynthesis. Measured isotopic
ratios suggest an enhancement of $^{18}$O as compared to our Galactic center, which we attribute
to an extra $^{18}$O injection from massive stars. Our observations show evidence for mixing of
distinct gas components with different degrees of processing. We observe an extra molecular component
of highly processed gas on top of the already proposed less processed gas being transported to the
central region of NGC 253. Such multicomponent nature and optical depth effects may hinder the use
of isotopic ratios based on spatially unresolved line to infer the star formation history and/or
initial stellar mass function properties in the nuclei of galaxies.
