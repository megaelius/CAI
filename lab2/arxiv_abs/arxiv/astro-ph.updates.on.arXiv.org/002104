We present the results from an X-ray spectral analysis of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the Chandra
Deep Field-South, AEGIS-XD and Chandra-COSMOS surveys, focussing on the identification and characterisation
of the most heavily obscured, Compton thick (CT, $N_{H}>10^{24} cm^{-2}$) sources. Our sample
is comprised of 3184 X-ray selected extragalactic sources, which has a high rate of redshift completeness
(97.6 %), and includes improved photometric redshifts over previous studies. We use spectral models
designed for heavily obscured AGN which self consistently include all major spectral signatures
of heavy absorption. We identify CT sources not selected through our spectral fitting method using
X-ray colours, validate our spectral fitting method through simulations, and take considerations
for the constraints on $N_{H}$ given the low count nature of many of our sources. After these considerations
we identify a total of 100 CT AGN with best-fit $N_{H}>10^{24} cm^{-2}$ and $N_{H}$ constrained
to be above $10^{23.5} cm^{-2}$ at 90% confidence. These sources cover an intrinsic $L_{X}$ range
of $10^{42}-3x10^{45}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ and a redshift range of z=0.1-4. This sample will enable characterisation
of these heavily obscured AGN across cosmic time and to ascertain their cosmological significance.
Furthermore, by using the torus models to test different covering factor scenarios, and by investigating
the inclusion of the soft scattered emission, we find evidence that the covering factor of the obscuring
material decreases with $L_{X}$ for all redshifts, consistent with the receding torus model, and
that this factor increases with redshift, consistent with an increase in the obscured fraction
towards higher redshifts. We make $N_{H}$, $\Gamma$ (with uncertainties), observed X-ray fluxes
and intrinsic $L_{X}$ for all sources analysed in this work publicly available in an online catalogue.
