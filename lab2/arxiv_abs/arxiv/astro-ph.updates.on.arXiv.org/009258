WFIRST-CGI is a NASA technology demonstration mission that is charged with demonstrating key technologies
for future exo-Earth imaging missions in space. In the process, it will obtain images and low-resolution
spectra of a handful to a dozen extrasolar planets and possibly protoplanetary disks. Its unprecedented
contrast levels in the optical will provide astronomers with their first direct look at mature,
Jupiter sized planets at moderate separations. This paper addresses the question: what science
can be done with such data? An analytic noise model, which is informed by the ongoing engineering
developments, is used to compute maximum achievable signal-to-noise ratios and scientifically
viable integration times for hypothetical star planet systems, as well as to investigate the constraining
power of various combinations of WFIRST-CGI photometric and spectral observations. This work
introduces two simple models for planetary geometric albedos, which are inspired largely by the
solar system's gas giants. The first planet model is a hybrid Jupiter-Neptune model, which separately
treats the short and long wavelengths where chromophores and methane dominate absorption, respectively.
The second planet model fixes cloud and haze properties in CoolTLusty to match Jupiter's albedo
spectrum, it then perturbs only the metallicity. MCMC retrievals performed on simulated observations
are used to assess the precision with which planet model parameters can be measured subject to different
exposure times and observing cases. Fit results for both models' parameterizations of geometric
albedo spectra demonstrate that a rough indication of the metallicity or methane content should
be possible for some WFIRST-CGI targets. We conclude that real observations will likely be able
to differentiate between extreme cases using these models, but will lack the precision necessary
to uncover subtle trends.
