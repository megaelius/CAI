The characterization of our Galaxy's longest filamentary gas features has been the subject of several
studies in recent years, producing not only a sizeable sample of large-scale filaments, but also
confusion as to whether all these features (e.g. "Bones", "Giant Molecular Filaments") are essentially
the same. They are not. We undertake the first standardized analysis of the physical properties
(densities, temperatures, morphologies, radial profiles) and kinematics of large-scale filaments
in the literature. We expand and improve upon prior analyses by using the same data sets, techniques,
and spiral arm models to disentangle the filaments' inherent properties from selection criteria
and methodology. Our results suggest that the myriad filament finding techniques are uncovering
different physical structures, with length (11-269 pc), width (1-40 pc), mass ($\rm 3\times10^3
\; M_\odot - 1.1 \times10^{6} \; M_\odot$), aspect ratio (3:1 - 117:1), and dense gas fraction (0.2-100%)
varying by at least an order of magnitude across the sample of 45 filaments. As part of this analysis,
we develop a radial profile fitting code, $RadFil$, which is publicly available. We also perform
a $position-position-velocity$ $(p-p-v)$ analysis on a subset of the filaments and find that while
60%-70% lie in the plane of the Galaxy, only 30-45% also exhibit kinematic proximity to purported
spiral arms. In a parameter space defined by aspect ratio, temperature, and density, we broadly
distinguish three filament categories, which could be indicative of different formation mechanisms
or histories. Highly elongated "Bone-like" filaments show the most potential for tracing gross
spiral structure (e.g. arms), while other categories could simply be large concentrations of molecular
gas (GMCs, core complexes).
