We estimate the bias on weak lensing mass measurements of shear-selected galaxy cluster samples.
The mass bias is expected to be significant because constructions of cluster samples from peaks
in weak lensing mass maps and measurements of cluster masses from their tangential shear profiles
share the same noise. We quantify this mass bias from large sets of mock cluster samples with analytical
density profiles and realistic large-scale structure noise from ray-tracing simulations. We
find that, even for peaks with signal-to-noise ratio larger than $4.0$ in weak lensing mass maps
constructed in a deep survey with a high source galaxy number density of $30~\mathrm{arcmin}^{-2}$,
derived weak lensing masses for these shear-selected clusters are still biased high by $\sim55\%$
on average. Such a large bias mainly originates from up-scattered low mass objects, which is an inevitable
consequence of selecting clusters with a noisy observable directly linked to the mass measurement.
We also investigate the dependence of the mass bias on different physical and observational parameters,
finding that the mass bias strongly correlates with cluster redshifts, true halo masses, and selection
signal-to-noise thresholds, but having moderate dependence on observed weak lensing masses and
survey depths. This bias, albeit considerable, can still be modeled accurately in statistical
studies of shear-selected clusters as the intrinsic scatter around the mean bias is found to be reasonable
in size. We demonstrate that such a bias can explain the deviation in X-ray properties previously
found on a shear-selected cluster sample. Our result will be useful for turning large samples of
shear-selected clusters available in future surveys into potential probes of cosmology and cluster
astrophysics.
