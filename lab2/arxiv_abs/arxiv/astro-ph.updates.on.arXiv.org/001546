We present the observational results of this kind of rare object 1SWASP J093010.78+533859.5, for
which the doubly eclips- ing feature had been detected previously from the SuperWASP photometric
archive. Individual PSF photometry for two objects with a separation of about 1.9 arcsec was performed
for the first time in this study. Our time-series photometric data confirms the finding of Lohr et
al. (2013) that the bright object A is an Algol-type detached eclipsing binary and the fainter B is
a W UMa-type contact eclipsing. Using the high- resolution optical spectra, we obtained well-defined
radial velocity variations of system A. Furthermore, stationary spectral lines were detected
that must have originated from a further, previously unrecognized stellar component. It was confirmed
by the third object contribution from the light curve analysis. No spectral feature of the system
B was detected, probably due to motion blur by long exposure time. We obtained the binary parameters
and the absolute dimensions of the systems A and B from light curve synthesis with and without radial
velocities, respectively. The primary and secondary components of system A have a spectral type
of K1 and K5 main sequences, respec- tively. Two components of system B have nearly the same type of
K3 main sequence. Light variations for both binaries are satisfactorily modeled by using two-spot
models with one starspot on each component. We estimated the distances to systems A and B individually.
Two systems may have similar distances of about 70 pc and seem to be gravitationally bound with a separation
of about 130 AU. In conclusion, we suggest that 1SWASP J093010.78+533859.5 is a quintuple stellar
system with a hierarchical structure of a triple system A(ab)c and a binary system B(ab).
