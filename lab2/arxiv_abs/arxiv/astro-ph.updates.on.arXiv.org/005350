We present the first 2D hydrodynamical finite volume simulations in which dust is fully coupled
with the gas, including its back-reaction onto it, and at the same time the dust size is evolving according
to coagulation and fragmentation based on a sub-grid model. The aim of this analysis is to present
the differences occurring when dust evolution is included relative to simulations with fixed dust
size, with and without an embedded Jupiter-mass planet that triggers gap formation. We use the two-fluid
polar Godunov-type code RoSSBi developed by Surville et al. 2016 combined with a new local sub-grid
method for dust evolution based on the model by Birnstiel et al. 2012. We find striking differences
between simulations with variable and fixed dust sizes. The timescales for dust depletion differ
significantly and yield a completely different evolution of the dust surface density. In general
sharp features such as pile-ups of dust in the inner disk and near gap edges, when a massive planet
is present, become much weaker. This has important implications on the interpretation of observed
substructure in disks, suggesting that the presence of a massive planet does not necessarily cause
sharp gaps and rings in the dust component. Also, particles with different dust sizes show a different
distribution, pointing to the importance of multi-wavelength synthetic observations in order
to compare with observations by ALMA and other instruments. We also find that simulations adopting
fixed intermediate particle sizes, in the range $10^{-2} - 10^{-1}$ cm, best approximate the surface
density evolution seen in simulations with dust evolution.
