Recent (sub)millimeter polarimetric observations toward the young star HL Tau have successfully
detected polarization emission from its circumstellar disk. The polarization pattern observed
at 0.87 mm is uniform and parallel to the disk's minor axis, consistent with the self-scattering
of thermal emission by dust particles whose maximum radius is $\approx 100~\mu m$. However, this
maximum size is considerably smaller than anticipated from dust evolution models that assume a
high sticking efficiency for icy particles in the outer part of protoplanetary disks. Here, we propose
that the unexpectedly small particle size can be explained if CO$_2$ ice covers the particles in
the outer region of the HL Tau disk. CO$_2$ ice is one of the most major interstellar ices after H$_2$O
ice, and laboratory experiments show that it is as nonsticky as silicates. We construct a dust evolution
model including CO$_2$ ice mantles and aggregate sintering, and provide 0.87 mm synthetic polarimetric
images of the HL Tau disk for two cases with and without dust fragmentation induced by CO$_2$ ice mantles.
We find that the models with CO$_2$ ice mantles provide a better match to the 0.87 mm polarimetric
observation. These models also predict that only particles lying between the H$_2$O and CO$_2$
lines can grow to millimeter to centimeter sizes, and that their rapid inward drift results in a local
dust gap similar to the 10 au gap of the HL Tau disk. We also suggest that the millimeter spectral index
for the outer part of the HL Tau disk is largely controlled by the optical thickness of this region
and does not necessarily indicate dust growth to millimeter sizes.
