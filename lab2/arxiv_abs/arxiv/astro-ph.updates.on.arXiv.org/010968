Axions are a promising dark matter candidate as well as a solution to the strong charge-parity (CP)
problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). We describe a new mission concept for SmallSat Solar Axion
and Activity X-ray Imager (SSAXI) to search for solar axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) and
to monitor solar activity of the entire solar disc over a wide dynamic range. SSAXI aims to unambiguously
identify X-rays converted from axions in the solar magnetic field along the line of sight to the solar
core, effectively imaging the solar core. SSAXI also plans to establish a statistical database
of X-ray activities from Active Regions, microflares, and Quiet Sun regions to understand the origin
of the solar corona heating processes. SSAXI employs Miniature lightweight Wolter-I focusing
X-ray optics (MiXO) and monolithic CMOS X-ray sensors in a compact package. The wide energy range
(0.5 - 6 keV) of SSAXI can easily distinguish spectra of axion-converted X-rays from typical X-ray
spectra of solar activities, while encompassing the prime energy band (3 - 4.5 keV) of axion-converted
X-rays. The high angular resolution (30 arcsec HPD) and large field of view (40 arcmin) in SSAXI will
easily resolve the enhanced X-ray flux over the 3 arcmin wide solar core while fully covering the
X-ray activity over the entire solar disc. The fast readout in the inherently radiation tolerant
CMOS X-ray sensors enables high resolution spectroscopy with a wide dynamic range in a broad range
of operational temperatures. SSAXI will operate in a Sun-synchronous orbit for 1 yr preferably
near a solar minimum to accumulate sufficient X-ray photon statistics.
