The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a project to assemble a Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)
network of mm wavelength dishes that can resolve strong field General Relativistic signatures
near a supermassive black hole. As planned, the EHT will include enough dishes to enable imaging
of the predicted black hole "shadow", a feature caused by severe light bending at the black hole boundary.
The center of M87, a giant elliptical galaxy, presents one of the most interesting EHT targets as
it exhibits a relativistic jet, offering the additional possibility of studying jet genesis on
Schwarzschild radius scales. Fully relativistic models of the M87 jet that fit all existing observational
constraints now allow horizon-scale images to be generated. We perform realistic VLBI simulations
of M87 model images to examine detectability of the black shadow with the EHT, focusing on a sequence
of model images with a changing jet mass load radius. When the jet is launched close to the black hole,
the shadow is clearly visible both at 230 and 345 GHz. The EHT array with a resolution of 20-30$\mu$as
resolution ($\sim$2-4 Schwarzschild radii) is able to image this feature independent of any theoretical
models and we show that imaging methods used to process data from optical interferometers are applicable
and effective for EHT data sets. We demonstrate that the EHT is also capable of tracing real-time
structural changes on a few Schwarzschild radii scales, such as those implicated by VHE flaring
activity of M87. While inclusion of ALMA in the EHT is critical for shadow imaging, generally the
array is robust against loss of a station.
