The initial stage of star formation is a complex area study because of its high density and low temperature.
Under such conditions, many molecules become depleted from the gas phase by freezing out onto dust
grains. However, the deuterated species could remain gaseous and are thus ideal tracers. We investigate
the gas dynamics and NH$_2$D chemistry in eight massive pre/protocluster clumps. We present NH$_2$D
1$_{11}$-1$_{01}$ (at 85.926 GHz), NH$_3$ (1, 1) and (2, 2) observations in the eight clumps using
the PdBI and the VLA, respectively. We find that the distribution between deuterium fractionation
and kinetic temperature shows a number density peak at around $T_{\rm kin}=16.1$ K, and the NH$_2$D
cores are mainly located at a temperature range of 13.0 to 22.0 K. We detect seven instances of extremely
high deuterium fractionation of $1.0 \leqslant D_{\rm frac} \leqslant 1.41$. We find that the NH$_2$D
emission does not appear to coincide exactly with either dust continuum or NH$_3$ peak positions,
but often surrounds the star-formation active regions. This suggests that the NH$_{2}$D has been
destroyed by the central young stellar object (YSO) due to its heating. The detected NH$_2$D lines
are very narrow with a median width of $\rm 0.98\pm0.02 km/s$. The extracted NH$_2$D cores are gravitationally
bound ($\alpha_{\rm vir} < 1$), are likely prestellar or starless, and can potentially form intermediate-mass
or high-mass stars. Using NH$_3$ (1, 1) as a dynamical tracer, we find very complicated dynamical
movement, which can be explained by a combined process with outflow, rotation, convergent flow,
collision, large velocity gradient, and rotating toroids. High deuterium fractionation strongly
depends on the temperature condition. NH$_2$D is a poor evolutionary indicator of high-mass star
formation in evolved stages, but a useful tracer in the starless and prestellar cores.
