Twenty-four years after the discoveries of the first exoplanets, the radial-velocity (RV) method
is still one of the most productive techniques to detect and confirm exoplanets. But stellar magnetic
activity can induce RV variations large enough to make it difficult to disentangle planet signals
from the stellar noise. In this context, HD41248 is an interesting planet-host candidate, with
RV observations plagued by activity-induced signals. We report on ESPRESSO observations of HD41248
and analyse them together with previous observations from HARPS with the goal of evaluating the
presence of orbiting planets. Using different noise models within a general Bayesian framework
designed for planet detection in RV data, we test the significance of the various signals present
in the HD41248 dataset. We use Gaussian processes as well as a first-order moving average component
to try to correct for activity-induced signals. At the same time, we analyse photometry from the
TESS mission, searching for transits and rotational modulation in the light curve. The number of
significantly detected Keplerian signals depends on the noise model employed, which can range
from 0 with the Gaussian process model to 3 with a white noise model. We find that the Gaussian process
alone can explain the RV data while allowing for the stellar rotation period and active region evolution
timescale to be constrained. The rotation period estimated from the RVs agrees with the value determined
from the TESS light curve. Based on the data that is currently available, we conclude that the RV variations
of HD41248 can be explained by stellar activity (using the Gaussian process model) in line with the
evidence from activity indicators and the TESS photometry.
