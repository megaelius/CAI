A main goal of NASA's Kepler Mission is to establish the frequency of potentially habitable Earth-size
planets (eta Earth). Relatively few such candidates identified by the mission can be confirmed
to be rocky via dynamical measurement of their mass. Here we report an effort to validate 18 of them
statistically using the BLENDER technique, by showing that the likelihood they are true planets
is far greater than that of a false positive. Our analysis incorporates follow-up observations
including high-resolution optical and near-infrared spectroscopy, high-resolution imaging,
and information from the analysis of the flux centroids of the Kepler observations themselves.
While many of these candidates have been previously validated by others, the confidence levels
reported typically ignore the possibility that the planet may transit a different star than the
target along the same line of sight. If that were the case, a planet that appears small enough to be
rocky may actually be considerably larger and therefore less interesting from the point of view
of habitability. We take this into consideration here, and are able to validate 15 of our candidates
at a 99.73% (3 sigma) significance level or higher, and the other three at slightly lower confidence.
We characterize the GKM host stars using available ground-based observations and provide updated
parameters for the planets, with sizes between 0.8 and 2.9 Earth radii. Seven of them (KOI-0438.02,
0463.01, 2418.01, 2626.01, 3282.01, 4036.01, and 5856.01) have a better than 50% chance of being
smaller than 2 Earth radii and being in the habitable zone of their host stars.
