We present the analysis of a peculiar W~Virginis (pWVir) type-II Cepheid, OGLE-LMC-T2CEP-211
($P_{puls}=9.393\,d$), in a double-lined binary system ($P_{orb}=242\,d$), which shed light
on virtually unknown evolutionary status and structure of pWVir stars. The dynamical mass of the
Cepheid (first ever for a type-II Cepheid) is $0.64\pm{}0.02\,M_\odot$ and the radius $R=25.1\pm{}0.3\,R_\odot$.
The companion is a massive ($5.67\,M_\odot$) main-sequence star obscured by a disk. Such configuration
suggests a mass transfer in the system history. We found that originally the system ($P_{orb}^{init}=12\,d$)
was composed of $3.5$ and $2.8\,M_\odot$ stars, with the current Cepheid being more massive. The
system age is now $\sim{}$200 My, and the Cepheid is almost completely stripped of hydrogen, with
helium mass of $\sim{}92\%$ of the total mass. It finished transferring the mass 2.5 My ago and is
evolving towards lower temperatures passing through the instability strip. Comparison with observations
indicate a reasonable $2.7\cdot{}10^{-8}\,M_\odot/y$ mass loss from the Cepheid. The companion
is most probably a Be main-sequence star with $T=22000\,K$ and $R=2.5\,R_\odot$. Our results yield
a good agreement with a pulsation theory model for a hydrogen-deficient pulsator, confirming the
described evolutionary scenario. We detected a two-ring disk ($R_{disk}\sim\,116\,R_{\odot}$)
and a shell ($R_{shell}\sim\,9\,R_{\odot}$) around the companion, that is probably a combination
of the matter from the past mass transfer, the mass being lost by the Cepheid due to wind and pulsations,
and a decretion disk around a rapidly rotating secondary. Our study together with observational
properties of pWVir stars suggests that their majority are products of a similar binary evolution
interaction.
