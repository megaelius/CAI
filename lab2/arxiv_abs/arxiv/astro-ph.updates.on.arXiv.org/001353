We review the formation and early evolution of the most massive and dense young stellar clusters,
focusing on the role they can play in our understanding of star and planet formation as a whole. Young
massive cluster (YMC) progenitor clouds in the Galactic Center can accumulate to a high enough density
without forming stars that the initial protostellar densities are close to the final stellar density.
For this to hold in the disk, the time scale to accumulate the gas to such high densities must be much
shorter than the star formation timescale. Otherwise the gas begins forming stars while it is being
accumulated to high density. The distinction between the formation regimes in the two environments
is consistent with the predictions of environmentally-dependent density thresholds for star
formation. This implies that stars in YMCs of similar total mass and radius can have formed at widely
different initial protostellar densities. The fact that no systematic variations in fundamental
properties are observed between YMCs in the disk and Galactic Center suggests stellar mass assembly
is not strongly affected by the initial protostellar density. We review recent theoretical advances
and summarize the debate on three key open questions: the initial (proto)stellar distribution,
infant (im)mortality and age spreads within YMCs. We conclude: the initial protostellar distribution
is likely hierarchical; YMCs likely experienced a formation history that was dominated by gas exhaustion
rather than gas expulsion; YMCs are dynamically stable from a young age; and YMCs have age spreads
much smaller than their mean age. Finally, we show that it is plausible that metal-rich globular
clusters may have formed in a similar way to YMCs in nearby galaxies. In summary, the study of YMC formation
bridges star/planet formation in the solar neighborhood to the oldest structures in the local Universe.
