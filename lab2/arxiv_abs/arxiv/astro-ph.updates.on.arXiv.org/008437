The three-dimensional structure of the gas flow around a planet is thought to influence the accretion
of both gas and solid materials. In particular, the outflow in the mid-plane region may prevent the
accretion of the solid materials and delay the formation of super-Earths' cores. However, it is
not yet understood how the nature of the flow field and outflow speed change as a function of the planetary
mass. In this study, we investigate the dependence of gas flow around a planet embedded in a protoplanetary
disc on the planetary mass. Assuming an isothermal, inviscid gas disc, we perform three-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations on the spherical polar grid, which has a planet located at its centre.
We find that gas enters the Bondi or Hill sphere at high latitudes and exits through the mid-plane
region of the disc regardless of the assumed dimensionless planetary mass $m=R_{\rm Bondi}/H$,
where $R_{\rm Bondi}$ and $H$ are the Bondi radius of the planet and disc scale height, respectively.
The altitude from where gas predominantly enters the envelope varies with the planetary mass. The
outflow speed can be expressed as $|u_{\rm out}|=\sqrt{3/2}mc_{\rm s}$ $(R_{\rm Bondi}\leq R_{\rm
Hill})$ or $|u_{\rm out}|=\sqrt{3/2}(m/3)^{1/3} c_{\rm s}$ ($R_{\rm Bondi}\geq R_{\rm Hill}$),
where $c_{\rm s}$ is the isothermal sound speed and $R_{\rm Hill}$ is the Hill radius. The outflow
around a planet may reduce the accretion of dust and pebbles onto the planet when $m\gtrsim\sqrt{\rm
St}$, where St is the Stokes number. Our results suggest that the flow around proto-cores of super-Earths
may delay their growth and, consequently, help them to avoid runaway gas accretion within the lifetime
of the gas disc.
