Radio relics are sites of electron (re)acceleration in merging galaxy clusters but the mechanism
of acceleration and the topology of the magnetic field in and near relics are yet to be understood.
We are carrying out an observational campaign on double relic galaxy clusters starting with RXC
J1314.4-2515. With $Jansky Very Large Array$ multi-configuration observations in the frequency
range 1-4 GHz, we perform both spectral and polarization analyses, using the Rotation Measure synthesis
technique. We use archival $XMM-Newton$ observations to constrain the properties of the shocked
region. We discover a possible connection between the activity of a radio galaxy and the emission
of the eastern radio relic. In the northern elongated arc of the western radio relic, we detect polarized
emission with an average polarization fraction of $31 \ \%$ at 3 GHz and we derive the Mach number of
the underlying X-ray shock. Our observations reveal low levels of fractional polarization and
Faraday-complex structures in the southern region of the relic, which point to the presence of thermal
gas and filamentary magnetic field morphology inside the radio emitting volume. We measured largely
different Rotation Measure dispersion from the two relics. Finally, we use cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical
simulations to constrain the magnetic field, viewing angle, and to derive the acceleration efficiency
of the shock. We find that the polarization properties of RXC J1314.4-2515 are consistent with a
radio relic observed at $70^{\circ}$ with respect to the line of sight and that efficient re-acceleration
of fossil electrons has taken place.
