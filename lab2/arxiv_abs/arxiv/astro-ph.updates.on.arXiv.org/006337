We present the analysis of the binary-lens microlensing event OGLE-2017-BLG-0537. The light curve
of the event exhibits two strong caustic-crossing spikes among which the second caustic crossing
was resolved by high-cadence surveys. It is found that the lens components with a mass ratio $\sim
0.5$ are separated in projection by $\sim 1.3\thetae$, where $\thetae$ is the angular Einstein
radius. Analysis of the caustic-crossing part yields $\thetae=1.77\pm 0.16$~mas and a lens-source
relative proper motion of $\mu =12.4\pm 1.1~{\rm mas}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The measured $\mu$ is the
third highest value among the events with measured proper motions and $\sim 3$ times higher than
the value of typical Galactic bulge events, making the event a strong candidate for follow-up observations
to directly image the lens by separating it from the source. From the angular Einstein radius combined
with the microlens parallax, it is estimated that the lens is composed of two main-sequence stars
with masses $M_1\sim 0.4~M_\odot$ and $M_2\sim 0.2~M_\odot$ located at a distance of $D_{\rm L}\sim
1.2$~kpc. However, the physical lens parameters are not very secure due to the weak microlens-parallax
signal, and thus we cross check the parameters by conducting a Bayesian analysis based on the measured
Einstein radius and event timescale combined with the blending constraint. From this, we find that
the physical parameters estimated from the Bayesian analysis are consistent with those based on
the measured microlens parallax. Resolving the lens from the source can be done in about 5 years from
high-resolution follow-up observations and this will provide a rare opportunity to test and refine
the microlensing model.
