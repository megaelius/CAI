We apply the Jeans Anisotropic MGE (JAM) dynamical modelling method to SAGES Legacy Unifying Globulars
and GalaxieS (SLUGGS) survey data of early-type galaxies in the stellar mass range $10^{10}<M_*/{\rm
M}_{\odot}<10^{11.6}$ that cover a large radial range of $0.1-4.0$ effective radii. We combine
SLUGGS and ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$ datasets to model the total-mass profiles of a sample of 21 fast-rotator
galaxies, utilising a hyperparameter method to combine the two independent datasets. The total-mass
density profile slope values derived for these galaxies are consistent with those measured in the
inner regions of galaxies by other studies. Furthermore, the total-mass density slopes ($\gamma_{\rm
tot}$) appear to be universal over this broad stellar mass range, with an average value of $\gamma_{\rm
tot}=-2.12\,\pm\,0.05$, i.e. slightly steeper than isothermal. We compare our results to model
galaxies from the Magneticum and EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, in order to probe
the mechanisms that are responsible for varying total-mass density profile slopes. The simulated-galaxy
slopes are shallower than the observed values by $\sim0.1-0.3$, indicating that the physical processes
shaping the mass distributions of galaxies in cosmological simulations are still incomplete.
For galaxies with $M_*>10^{10.7}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ in the Magneticum simulations, we identify
a significant anticorrelation between total-mass density profile slopes and the fraction of stellar
mass formed ex situ (i.e. accreted), whereas this anticorrelation is weaker for lower stellar masses,
implying that the measured total mass density slopes for low-mass galaxies are less likely to be
determined by merger activity.
