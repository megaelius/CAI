We present the results based on magnetic fields (B-fields), probed using JCMT SCUBA-2/POL-2 observations
of polarized dust emission at 850 $\mu$m, towards two clumps (clump 1 and clump 2) formed at the waist
of the bipolar H\,{\sc ii} region Sh2-201. We complement these data with archival CO data from JCMT/HARP
and 21~cm radio continuum data from VLA. We find that the morphology of B-fields in clumps are bent
and compressed by the expanding H\,{\sc ii} region, thereby following a bow-like morphology in
clump 1. B-fields strengths are estimated using the modified Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi relations
to be 266$\pm$32 $\mu$G for clump 1 and 65$\pm$6 $\mu$G for clump 2. We suggest that B-fields become
stronger in accordance with the amount of H\,{\sc ii} emission interacting with the clump surfaces.
Comparison among the various pressure values suggests that B-fields dominate in clump 1, whereas
ionized gas thermal pressure dominates on clump 2. Comparison between pressures imparted by the
stellar feedback (thermal pressure from expanding H\,{\sc{ii}} region) and the clump internal
pressure (sum of magnetic, turbulence, and gas thermal pressures) reveals that further expansion
of the H\,{\sc{ii}} region will be stopped by clump 1, however, clump 2 maintains a near equilibrium
with the stellar feedback. The virial analyses reveal that clump 1 is bound by its gravity, whereas
the clump 2 is unbound. In addition, the critical mass ratios suggest that clump 1 could be undergoing
collapse as the combined contribution from neutral gas thermal energy, turbulence, and B-fields
is not sufficient to counteract the gravity. In contrast, clump 2 is stable because of the strong
support rendered by these three factors.
