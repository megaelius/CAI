We present a concept study of a solar wind forecasting method for Earth, based on persistence modeling
from STEREO in-situ measurements combined with multi-viewpoint EUV observational data. By comparing
the fractional areas of coronal holes (CHs) extracted from EUV data of STEREO and SoHO/SDO, we perform
an uncertainty assessment derived from changes in the CHs and apply those changes to the predicted
solar wind speed profile at 1AU. We evaluate the method for the time period 2008-2012, and compare
the results to a persistence model based on ACE in-situ measurements and to the STEREO persistence
model without implementing the information on CH evolution. Compared to an ACE based persistence
model, the performance of the STEREO persistence model which takes into account the evolution of
CHs, is able to increase the number of correctly predicted high-speed streams by about 12%, and to
decrease the number of missed streams by about 23%, and the number of false alarms by about 19%. However,
the added information on CH evolution is not able to deliver more accurate speed values for the forecast
than using the STEREO persistence model without CH information which performs better than an ACE
based persistence model. Investigating the CH evolution between STEREO and Earth view for varying
separation angles over ~25-140{\deg} East of Earth, we derive some relation between expanding
CHs and increasing solar wind speed, but a less clear relation for decaying CHs and decreasing solar
wind speed. This fact most likely prevents the method from making more precise forecasts. The obtained
results support a future L5 mission and show the importance and valuable contribution using multi-viewpoint
data.
