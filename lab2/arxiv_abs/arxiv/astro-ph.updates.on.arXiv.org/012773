Component separation is one of the key stages of any modern, cosmic microwave background (CMB) data
analysis pipeline. It is an inherently non-linear procedure and typically involves a series of
sequential solutions of linear systems with similar, albeit not identical system matrices, derived
for different data models of the same data set. Sequences of this kind arise for instance in the maximization
of the data likelihood with respect to foreground parameters or sampling of their posterior distribution.
However, they are also common in many other contexts. In this work we consider solving the component
separation problem directly in the measurement (time) domain, which can have a number of important
advantageous over the more standard pixel-based methods, in particular if non-negligible time-domain
noise correlations are present as it is commonly the case. The time-domain based approach implies,
however, significant computational effort due to the need to manipulate the full volume of time-domain
data set. To address this challenge, we propose and study efficient solvers adapted to solving time-domain-based,
component separation systems and their sequences and which are capable of capitalizing on information
derived from the previous solutions. This is achieved either via adapting the initial guess of the
subsequent system or through a so-called subspace recycling, which allows to construct progressively
more efficient, two-level preconditioners. We report an overall speed-up over solving the systems
independently of a factor of nearly 7, or 5, in the worked examples inspired respectively by the likelihood
maximization and likelihood sampling procedures we consider in this work.
