Black holes in binaries with other compact objects can provide natural venues for indirect detection
of axions or other ultralight fields. The superradiant instability associated with a rapidly spinning
black hole leads to the creation of an axion cloud which carries energy and angular momentum from
the black hole. This cloud will then decay via gravitational wave emission. We show that the energy
lost as a result of this process tends toward an outspiraling of the binary orbit. A given binary system
is sensitive to a narrow range of axion masses, determined by the mass of the black hole. Pulsar-black
hole binaries, once detected in the electromagnetic band, will allow high-precision measurements
of black hole mass loss via timing measurements of the companion pulsar. This avenue of investigation
is particularly promising in light of the recent preliminary announcements of two candidate black
hole-neutron star mergers by LIGO/VIRGO (#S190814bv and #S190426c). We demonstrate that for such
a binary system with a typical millisecond pulsar and a 3-solar-mass black hole, axions with masses
between $2.7 \times 10^{-12}$ eV and $3.2 \times 10^{-12}$ eV are detectable. Recent gravitational
wave observations by LIGO/VIRGO of binary black hole mergers imply that, for these binaries, gravitational
radiation from the rotating quadrupole moment is a dominant effect, causing an inspiraling orbit.
With some reasonable assumptions about the period of the binary when it formed and the spins of the
black holes, these observations rule out possible axion masses between $3 \times 10^{-13}$ eV and
$6 \times 10^{-13}$ eV. Future binary black hole observations, for example by LISA, are expected
to provide more robust bounds. In some circumstances, neutron stars may also undergo superradiant
instabilities, and binary pulsars could be used to exclude axions with certain masses and matter
couplings.
