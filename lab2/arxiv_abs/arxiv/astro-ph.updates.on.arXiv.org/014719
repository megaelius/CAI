Low-mass probes propelled by directed energy from earth are an early option for exploration of nearby
star systems. A challenging aspect of such technology is returning scientific observational data
to earth. We compare two configurations for achieving this. A direct configuration utilizes optical
transmission from the probe to a terrestrial receiver employing a large photon collector. In a relay
configuration, probes spaced at uniform intervals act as regenerative repeaters for the scientific
data, which eventually arrives at a terrestrial receiver from the most recently launched probe.
A number of advantages and disadvantages of the relay configuration are discussed. A numerical
comparison approximates equal probe mass in the two cases by using the same optical transmit power
and equivalent total transmit plus receive aperture area. When the total downlink data rate is equal,
the relay configuration benefits from a smaller terrestrial receive collector, but also requires
very frequent launches to achieve higher data rates due to the limitations on relay probe receive
aperture area. The direct configuration can achieve higher data rates without such frequent launches
by increasing terrestrial collector area. A single-point failure problem in the relay configuration
can be addressed by introducing relay-bypass modes, but only at the expense of further increases
in launch rate or reductions in data volume, as well as a considerable increase in design and operational
complexity. Taking into account launch and collector area costs, the direct configuration is found
to achieve lower overall cost by a wide margin over a range of cost parameter values and data rates.
