One of the most striking properties of galaxies is the bimodality in their star-formation rates.
A major puzzle is why any given galaxy is star-forming or quiescent, and a wide range of physical mechanisms
have been proposed as solutions. We consider how observations, such as might be available in upcoming
large galaxy surveys, might distinguish different galaxy quenching scenarios. To do this, we combine
an N-body simulation and multiple prescriptions from the literature to create several quiescent
galaxy mock catalogues. Each prescription uses a different set of galaxy properties (such as history,
environment, centrality) to assign individual simulation galaxies as quiescent. We find how and
how much the resulting quiescent galaxy distributions differ from each other, both intrinsically
and observationally. In addition to tracing observational consequences of different quenching
mechanisms, our results indicate which sorts of quenching models might be most readily disentangled
by upcoming observations and which combinations of observational quantities might provide the
most discriminatory power. Our observational measures are auto, cross, and marked correlation
functions, pro- jected density distributions, and group multiplicity functions, which rely upon
galaxy positions, stellar masses and of course quiescence. Although degeneracies between models
are present for individual observations, using multiple observations in concert allows us to distinguish
between all ten models we consider. In addition to identifying intrinsic and observational consequences
of quiescence prescriptions and testing these quiescence models against each other and observations,
these methods can also be used to validate colors (or other history and environment dependent properties)
in simulated mock catalogues.
