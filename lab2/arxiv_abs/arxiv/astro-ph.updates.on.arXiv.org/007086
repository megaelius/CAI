Massive neutrinos, due to their free streaming, produce a suppression in the matter power spectrum
at intermediate and small scales which could be probed by galaxy clustering and/or weak lensing
observables. This effect happens at scales that are also influenced by baryon feedback, i.e. galactic
winds or Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback, which in realistic hydrodynamic simulations has
also been shown to produce a suppression of power. Leaving aside, for the moment, the complex issue
of galaxy bias, we focus here on matter clustering and tomographic weak lensing, we investigate
the possible degeneracy between baryon feedback and neutrinos showing that it is not likely to degrade
significantly the measurement of neutrino mass in future surveys. To do so, we generate mock data
sets and fit them using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique and explore degeneracies between
feedback parameters and neutrino mass. We model baryon feedback through fitting functions, while
massive neutrinos are accounted for, also in the non-linear regime, using Halofit calibrated against
accurate N-body neutrino simulations. In the error budget, we include the uncertainty in the modelling
of non-linearities. For both matter clustering and weak lensing, we always recover the input neutrino
mass within $\sim 0.25\sigma$ confidence level. Finally, we also take into account the intrinsic
alignment effect in the weak lensing mock data. Even in this case, we are able to recover the right
parameters: in particular, we find a significant degeneracy pattern between $M_\nu$ and the intrinsic
alignment parameter $A_\mathrm{IA}$ .
