High-resolution Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry observations of NGC 1052 show a two sided
jet with several regions of enhanced emission and a clear emission gap between the two jets.This
gap shrinks with increasing frequency and vanishes around $\nu\sim43$ GHz. The observed structures
are due to both the macroscopic fluid dynamics interacting with the surrounding ambient medium
including an obscuring torus and the radiation microphysics. In this paper we investigate the possible
physical conditions in relativistic jets of NGC 1052 by directly modelling the observed emission
and spectra via state-of-the-art special-relativistic hydrodynamic (SRHD) simulations and
radiative transfer calculations. To investigate the physical conditions in the relativistic
jet we coupled our radiative transfer code to evolutionary algorithms and performed simultaneous
modelling of the observed jet structure and the broadband radio spectrum. During the calculation
of the radiation we consider both thermal and non-thermal emission. In order to compare our model
to VLBI observations we take into account the sparse sampling of the u-v plane, the array properties
and the imaging algorithm. We present for the first time an end-to-end pipeline for fitting numerical
simulations to VLBI observations of relativistic jets taking into account the macrophysics including
fluid dynamics and ambient medium configurations together with thermal/non-thermal emission
and the properties of the observing array. The detailed analysis of our simulations shows that the
structure and properties of the observed relativistic jets in NGC 1052 can be reconstructed by a
slightly over-pressured jet ($d_k\sim1.5$) embedded in a decreasing pressure ambient medium
