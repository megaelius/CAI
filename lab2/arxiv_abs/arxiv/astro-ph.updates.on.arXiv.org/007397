After stars formed in the early Universe, their ultraviolet light is expected, eventually, to have
penetrated the primordial hydrogen gas and altered the excitation state of its 21-centimetre hyperfine
line. This alteration would cause the gas to absorb photons from the cosmic microwave background,
producing a spectral distortion that should be observable today at radio frequencies of less than
200 megahertz. Here we report the detection of a flattened absorption profile in the sky-averaged
radio spectrum, which is centred at a frequency of 78 megahertz and has a best-fitting full-width
at half-maximum of 19 megahertz and an amplitude of 0.5 kelvin. The profile is largely consistent
with expectations for the 21-centimetre signal induced by early stars, however, the best-fitting
amplitude of the profile is more than a factor of two greater than the largest predictions. This discrepancy
suggests that either the primordial gas was much colder than expected or the background radiation
temperature was hotter than expected. Astrophysical phenomena (such as radiation from stars and
stellar remnants) are unlikely to account for this discrepancy, of the proposed extensions to the
standard model of cosmology and particle physics, only cooling of the gas as a result of interactions
between dark matter and baryons seems to explain the observed amplitude. The low-frequency edge
of the observed profile indicates that stars existed and had produced a background of Lyman-alpha
photons by 180 million years after the Big Bang. The high-frequency edge indicates that the gas was
heated to above the radiation temperature less than 100 million years later.
