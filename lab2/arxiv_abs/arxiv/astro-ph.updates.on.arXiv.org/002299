Context. Debris disks are intrinsically connected to the planetary system's formation and evolution.
The development of high-contrast imaging techniques in the past 20 years is now allowing the detection
of faint material around bright stars with high angular resolution, hence opening an avenue to study
in detail the structures of circumstellar disks and their relation to planetary formation. Aims.
The purpose of this paper is to revisit the morphology of the almost edge-on debris disk around HD
15115. Methods. We analyzed data from the Gemini science archive obtained in 2009 and 2011 with the
Near-Infrared Coronagraphic Imager instrument in the H and Ks bands using coronagraphy and angular
differential imaging tech- niques. Results. We resolved the disk in both the H and Ks bands. We confirmed
the position angles inferred by previous authors, as well as the brightness asymmetry, which is
the origin of the object's nickname, the blue needle. We were able to detect the bow-like shape of
the disk suspected from other observations. However, these new NICI images suggest the presence
of a highly inclined ring-like disk of which we see the brighter side and the ansae located at 90 AU
symmetrically about the star. The inner part is likely depleted of dust. The fainter side of the disk
is suspected but not firmly detected, which also indicates a large anisotropic scattering factor.
Conclusions. The morphological symmetry of the disk contrasts with the obvious brightness asymmetry.
This asymmetry may be explained by the coexistence of several types of grains in this disk and/or
variable dust density. Interaction with the interstellar medium was invoked by previous authors
as a possible explanation but other mechanisms may account for the brightness asymmetry, for instance
a recent collision in the disk
