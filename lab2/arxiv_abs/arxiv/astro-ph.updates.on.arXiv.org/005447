We present nebular phase optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of the nearby Type Ia supernova
(SN) 2017cbv. The early, high cadence light curves of SN 2017cbv showed a prominent blue bump in the
$U$, $B$ and $g$ bands lasting for $\sim$5 d, the clearest such feature seen to date. One interpretation
of the early light curve was that the excess blue light was due to shocking of the SN ejecta against
a nondegenerate companion star -- a signature of the single degenerate scenario. If this is the correct
interpretation, the interaction between the SN ejecta and the companion star could result in significant
H$\alpha$ (or helium) emission at late times, possibly along with other species, depending on the
companion star and its orbital separation. A search for H$\alpha$ emission in our +302 d spectrum
yields a nondetection, with a $L_{H\alpha}$$<$1.5$\times$10$^{36}$ erg/s (given an assumed
distance of $D$=16.9 Mpc), which we have verified by implanting simulated H$\alpha$ emission into
our data. We make a quantitative comparison to models of swept-up material stripped from a nondegenerate
companion star, and limit the mass of hydrogen that might remain undetected in the progenitor system
of SN 2017cbv to $M_{\rm H} < 2 \times 10^{-4}$ $\rm M_{\odot}$. A similar analysis of putative helium
star related lines yields a $M_{\rm He} < 5-6 \times 10^{-4}$ $\rm M_{\odot}$ for that scenario.
Taken at face value, these results argue against a nondegenerate H or He-rich companion in Roche
lobe overflow as the progenitor of SN 2017cbv. Alternatively, there could be weaknesses in the envelope-stripping
and radiative transfer models necessary to interpret the strong H and He flux limits.
