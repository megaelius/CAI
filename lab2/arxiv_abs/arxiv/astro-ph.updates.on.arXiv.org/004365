The massive star origins for Type IIP supernovae (SNe) have been established through direct detection
of their red supergiants progenitors in pre-explosion observations; however, there has been limited
success in the detection of the progenitors of H-deficient SNe. The final fate of more massive stars,
capable of undergoing a Wolf-Rayet phase, and the origins of Type Ibc SNe remains debated, including
the relative importance of single massive star progenitors or lower mass stars stripped in binaries.
We present an analysis of the ages and spatial distributions of massive stars around the sites of
23 stripped-envelope SNe, as observed with the Hubble Space Telescope, to probe the possible origins
of the progenitors of these events. Using a Bayesian stellar populations analysis scheme, we find
characteristic ages for the populations observed within $150\,\mathrm{pc}$ of the target Type
IIb, Ib and Ic SNe to be $\log (t) = 7.20$, $7.05$ and $6.57$, respectively. The Type Ic SNe in the sample
are nearly all observed within $100\,\mathrm{pc}$ of young, dense stellar populations. The environment
around SN 2002ap is an important exception both in terms of age and spatial properties. These findings
may support the hypothesis that stars with $M_{init} > 30M_{\odot}$ produce a relatively large
proportion of Type Ibc SNe, and that these SN subtypes arise from progressively more massive progenitors.
Significantly higher extinctions are derived towards the populations hosting these SNe than previously
used in analysis of constraints from pre-explosion observations. The large initial masses inferred
for the progenitors are in stark contrast with the low ejecta masses estimated from SN light curves.
