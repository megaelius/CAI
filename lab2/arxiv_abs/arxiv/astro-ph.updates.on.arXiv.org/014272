Surveys of protoplanetary disks in star-forming regions of similar age revealed significant variations
in average disk mass between some regions. For instance, disks in the Orion Nebular Cluster (ONC)
and Corona Australis (CrA) are on average smaller than disks observed in Lupus, Taurus, Chamaeleon
I or Ophiuchus. In contrast to previous models that study truncation of disks at a late stage of their
evolution, we investigate whether disks may already be born with systematically smaller disk sizes
in more massive star-forming regions as a consequence of enhanced ionization rates. Assuming various
cosmic-ray ionization rates, we compute the resistivities for ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation
with a chemical network, and perform 2D non-ideal magnetohydrodynamical protostellar collapse
simulations. A higher ionization rate leads to stronger magnetic braking, and hence to the formation
of smaller disks. Accounting for recent findings that protostars act as forges of cosmic rays and
considering only mild attenuation during the collapse phase, we show that a high average cosmic-ray
ionization rate in star-forming regions like the ONC or CrA can explain the detection of smaller
disks in these regions. Our results show that on average a higher ionization rate leads to the formation
of smaller disks. Therefore, smaller disks in regions of similar age can be the consequence of different
levels of ionization, and may not exclusively be caused by disk truncation via external photoevaporation.
We strongly encourage observations that allow measuring the cosmic-ray ionization degrees in
different star-forming regions to test our hypothesis.
