We have modelled the stellar and nebular continua and emission-line intensity ratios of massive
stellar populations in the Antennae galaxy using high resolution and self-consistent libraries
of model HII regions around central clusters of aging stars. The model libraries are constructed
using the stellar population synthesis code, Starburst99, and photoionisation model, Cloudy.
The Geneva and PARSEC stellar evolutionary models are plugged into Starburst99 to allow comparison
between the two models. Using a spectrum-fitting methodology that allows the spectral features
in the stellar and nebular continua (e.g. Wolf-Rayet features, Paschen jump), and emission-line
diagnostics to constrain the models, we apply the libraries to the high-resolution MUSE spectra
of the starbursting regions in the Antennae galaxy. Through this approach, we were able to model
the continuum emission from Wolf-Rayet stars and extract stellar and gas metallicities, ages,
electron temperatures and densities of starbursts by exploiting the full spectrum. From the application
to the Antennae galaxy, we find that (1) the starbursts in the Antennae galaxy are characterised
by stellar and gas metallicities of around solar, (2) the star-forming gas in starbursts in the Western
loop of NGC 4038 appear to be more enriched, albeit slightly, than the rest of galaxy, (3) the youngest
starbursts are found across the overlap region and over parts of the western-loop, though in comparison,
the regions in the western-loop appear to be at a slightly later stage in star-formation than the
overlap region, and (4) the results obtained from fitting the Geneva and Parsec models are largely
consistent.
