The Nadir and Occultation for MArs Discovery instrument (NOMAD), onboard the ExoMars Trace Gas
Orbiter (TGO) spacecraft was conceived to observe Mars in solar occultation, nadir, and limb geometries,
and will be able to produce an outstanding amount of diverse data, mostly focused on properties of
the atmosphere. The infrared channels of the instrument operate by combining an echelle grating
spectrometer with an Acousto-Optical Tunable Filter (AOTF). Using in-flight data, we characterized
the instrument performance and parameterized its calibration. In particular: an accurate frequency
calibration was achieved, together with its variability due to thermal effects on the grating.
The AOTF properties and transfer function were also quantified, and we developed and tested a realistic
method to compute the spectral continuum transmitted through the coupled grating + AOTF system.
The calibration results enabled unprecedented insights into the important problem of the sensitivity
of NOMAD to methane abundances in the atmosphere. We also deeply characterized its performance
under realistic conditions of varying aerosol abundances, diverse albedos and changing illumination
conditions as foreseen over the nominal mission. The results show that, in low aerosol conditions,
NOMAD single spectrum, 1-sigma sensitivity to CH4 is around 0.33 ppbv at 20 km of altitude when performing
solar occultations, and better than 1 ppbv below 30 km. In dusty conditions, we show that the sensitivity
drops to 0 below 10 km. In Nadir geometry, results demonstrate that NOMAD will be able to produce seasonal
maps of CH4 with a sensitivity around 5 ppbv over most of planet's surface with spatial integration
over 5x5 degrees bins. Results show also that such numbers can be improved by a factor of 10 to 30 by
data binning. Overall, our results quantify NOMAD's capability to address the variable aspects
of Martian climate.
