We perform a self-calibration of the richness-to-mass ($N$-$M$) relation of CAMIRA galaxy clusters
with richness $N\geq15$ at redshift $0.2\leq z<1.1$ by modeling redshift-space two-point correlation
functions. These correlation functions are $\xi_{\mathrm{cc}}$ of CAMIRA clusters, the auto-correlation
function $\xi_{\mathrm{gg}}$ of the CMASS galaxies spectroscopically observed in the BOSS survey,
and the cross-correlation function $\xi_{\mathrm{cg}}$ between these two samples. We focus on
constraining the normalization $A_{\mathrm{N}}$ of the $N$-$M$ relation in a forward-modeling
approach, carefully accounting for the redshift-space distortion, the Finger-of-God effect,
and the uncertainty in photometric redshifts of CAMIRA clusters. The modeling also takes into account
the projection effect on the halo bias of CAMIRA clusters. The parameter constraints are shown to
be unbiased according to validation tests using a large set of mock catalogs constructed from N-body
simulations. At the pivotal mass $M_{500}=10^{14}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ and the pivotal redshift
$z_{\mathrm{piv}} = 0.6$, the resulting normalization $A_{\mathrm{N}}$ is constrained as $13.8^{+5.8}_{-4.2}$,
$13.2^{+3.4}_{-2.7}$, and $11.9^{+3.0}_{-1.9}$ by modeling $\xi_{\mathrm{cc}}$, $\xi_{\mathrm{cc}}+\xi_{\mathrm{cg}}$,
and $\xi_{\mathrm{cc}} + \xi_{\mathrm{cg}} + \xi_{\mathrm{gg}}$, with average uncertainties
at levels of $36\%$, $23\%$, and $21\%$, respectively. We find that the resulting $A_{\mathrm{N}}$
is statistically consistent with those independently obtained from weak-lensing magnification
and from a joint analysis of shear and cluster abundance, with a preference for a lower value at a level
of $\lesssim1.9\sigma$. This implies that the absolute mass scale of CAMIRA clusters inferred
from clustering is mildly higher than those from the independent methods. [abridged]
