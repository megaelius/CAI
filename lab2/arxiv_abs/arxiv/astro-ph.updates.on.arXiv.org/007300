We present chemical abundances and radial velocities of six HII regions in the extremely metal-poor
star-forming dwarf galaxy DDO 68. They are derived from deep spectra in the wavelength range 3500
- 10,000 {\AA}, acquired with the Multi Object Double Spectrograph (MODS) at the Large Binocular
Telescope (LBT). In the three regions where the [O III]$\lambda$4363 {\AA} line was detected, we
inferred the abundance of He, N, O, Ne, Ar, and S through the "direct" method. We also derived the oxygen
abundances of all the six regions adopting indirect method calibrations. We confirm that DDO 68
is an extremely metal-poor galaxy, and a strong outlier in the luminosity - metallicity relation
defined by star-forming galaxies. With the direct-method we find indeed an oxygen abundance of
12+log(O/H)=7.14$\pm$0.07 in the northernmost region of the galaxy and, although with large uncertainties,
an even lower 12+log(O/H)=6.96$\pm$0.09 in the "tail". This is, at face value, the most metal-poor
direct abundance detection of any galaxy known. We derive a radial oxygen gradient of -0.06$\pm$0.03
dex/kpc (or -0.30 dex $R_{25}^{-1}$) with the direct method, and a steeper gradient of -0.12$\pm$0.03
dex/kpc (or -0.59 dex $R_{25}^{-1}$) from the indirect method. For the $\alpha$-element to oxygen
ratios we obtain values in agreement with those found in other metal-poor star-forming dwarfs.
For nitrogen, instead, we infer much higher values, leading to log(N/O)$\sim-1.4$, at variance
with the suggested existence of a tight plateau at $-1.6$ in extremely metal poor dwarfs. The derived
helium mass fraction ranges from Y=0.240$\pm$0.005 to Y=0.25$\pm$0.02, compatible with standard
big bang nucleosynthesis. Finally, we measured HII region radial velocities in the range 479$-$522
km/s from the tail to the head of the "comet", consistent with the rotation derived in the HI.
