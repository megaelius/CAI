We study the gas and stellar mass content of galaxy groups and clusters in the FABLE suite of cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations, including the evolution of their central brightest cluster galaxies
(BCGs), satellite galaxies and intracluster light (ICL). The total gas and stellar mass of FABLE
clusters are in very good agreement with observations and show negligible redshift evolution at
fixed halo mass for $M_{500} \gtrsim 3 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$ at $z \lesssim 1$, in line with recent
findings from Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)-selected cluster samples. Importantly, the simulations
predict significant redshift evolution in these quantities in the low mass ($M_{500} \sim 10^{14}
M_{\odot}$) regime, which will be testable with upcoming SZ surveys such as SPT-3G. While the stellar
masses of FABLE BCGs are in reasonable agreement with observations, the total stellar mass in satellite
galaxies is lower than observed and the total mass in ICL is somewhat higher. This may be caused by
enhanced tidal stripping of satellite galaxies due to their large sizes. BCGs are characterised
by moderate stellar mass growth at $z < 1$ coincident with a late-time development of the ICL. The
level of BCG mass growth is in good agreement with recent observations, however, we caution that
the inferred growth depends sensitively on the mass definition. We further show that in-situ star
formation contributes more than half the mass of a BCG over its lifetime, the bulk of which is gained
at $z > 1$ where star formation rates are highest. The stellar mass profiles of the BCG+ICL component
are similar to observed profiles out to $\sim 100$ kpc at $z \approx 0$ and follow a close to power law
shape out to several hundred kpc. We further demonstrate that the inferred size growth of BCGs can
be severely biased by the choice of parametric model and the outer radius of the fit.
