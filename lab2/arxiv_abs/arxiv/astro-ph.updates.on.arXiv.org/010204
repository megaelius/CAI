Multi-messenger astrophysics, a long-anticipated extension to traditional and multiwavelength
astronomy, has recently emerged as a distinct discipline providing unique and valuable insights
into the properties and processes of the physical universe. These insights arise from the inherently
complementary information carried by photons, gravitational waves, neutrinos, and cosmic rays
about individual cosmic sources and source populations. Realizing the observation of astrophysical
sources via non-photonic messengers has presented enormous challenges, as evidenced by the fiscal
and physical scales of the multi-messenger observatories. However, the scientific payoff has
already been substantial, with even greater rewards promised in the years ahead. In this review
we survey the current status of multi-messenger astrophysics, highlighting some exciting recent
results, and addressing the major follow-on questions they have raised. Key recent achievements
include the measurement of the spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic rays out to the highest observable
energies; discovery of the diffuse high energy neutrino background; the first direct detections
of gravitational waves and the use of gravitational waves to characterize merging black holes and
neutron stars in strong-field gravity; and the identification of the first joint electromagnetic
+ gravitational wave and electromagnetic + high-energy neutrino multi-messenger sources. We
then review the rationales for the next generation of multi-messenger observatories, and outline
a vision of the most likely future directions for this exciting and rapidly advancing field.
