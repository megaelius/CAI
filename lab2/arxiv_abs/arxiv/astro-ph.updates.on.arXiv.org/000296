The Planck nominal mission cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps yield unprecedented constraints
on primordial non-Gaussianity (NG). Using three optimal bispectrum estimators, separable template-fitting
(KSW), binned, and modal, we obtain consistent values for the primordial local, equilateral, and
orthogonal bispectrum amplitudes, quoting as our final result f_NL^local=2.7 +/- 5.8, f_NL^equil=
-42 +/- 75, and f_NL^ortho= -25 +/- 39 (68% CL statistical); and we find the Integrated-Sachs-Wolfe-lensing
bispectrum expected in the LambdaCDM scenario. The results are based on comprehensive cross-validation
of these estimators on Gaussian and non-Gaussian simulations, are stable across component separation
techniques, pass an extensive suite of tests, and are confirmed by skew-C_l, wavelet bispectrum
and Minkowski functional estimators. Beyond estimates of individual shape amplitudes, we present
model-independent, three-dimensional reconstructions of the Planck CMB bispectrum and thus
derive constraints on early-Universe scenarios that generate primordial NG, including general
single-field models of inflation, excited initial states (non-Bunch-Davies vacua), and directionally-dependent
vector models. We provide an initial survey of scale-dependent feature and resonance models. These
results bound both general single-field and multi-field model parameter ranges, such as the speed
of sound, c_s \geq 0.02 (95% CL), in an effective field theory parametrization, and the curvaton
decay fraction r_D \geq 0.15 (95% CL). The Planck data put severe pressure on ekpyrotic/cyclic scenarios.
The amplitude of the four-point function in the local model tau_NL< 2800 (95% CL). Taken together,
these constraints represent the highest precision tests to date of physical mechanisms for the
origin of cosmic structure.
