We present hydrodynamical simulations of interacting Coronal Mass Ejections in the Interplanetary
medium (ICMEs). In these events, two consecutive CMEs are launched from the Sun in similar directions
within an interval of time of a few hours. In our numerical model, we assume that the ambient solar
wind is characterized by its velocity and mass-loss rate. Then, the CMEs are generated when the flow
velocity and mass-loss rate suddenly change, with respect to the ambient solar wind conditions
during two intervals of time, which correspond to the durations of the CMEs. After their interaction,
a merged region is formed and evolve as a single structure into the interplanetary medium. In this
work, we are interested in the general morphology of this merged region, which depends on the initial
parameters of the ambient solar wind and each of the CMEs involved. In order to understand this morphology,
we have performed a parametric study in which we characterize the effects of the initial parameters
variations on the density and velocity profiles at 1 AU, using as reference the well-documented
event of July 25th, 2004. Based on this parametrization we were able to reproduce with a high accuracy
the observed profiles. Then, we apply the parametrization results to the interaction events of
May 23, 2010; August 1, 2010; and November 9, 2012. With this approach and using values for the input
parameters within the CME observational errors, our simulated profiles reproduce the main features
observed at 1 AU. Even though we do not take into account the magnetic field, our models give a physical
insight into the propagation and interaction of ICMEs.
