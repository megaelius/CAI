Cyclic sedimentation has varied at several timescales and this variability has been geologically
well documented at Milankovitch timescales, controlled in part by climatically (insolation)
driven sea-level changes. At the longer (tens of Myr) timescales connection between astronomical
parameters and sedimentation via cyclic solar-system motions within the Milky Way has also been
proposed, but this hypothesis remains controversial because of the lack of long geological records.
The absence of a physical mechanism that could explain the connection between climate and astronomy
at these longer timescales led to the explanation of plate motions as the main driver of climate on
Earth. Here we statistically show a prominent and persistent ~36 Myr sedimentary cyclicity superimposed
on two megacycles (~250 Myr) in a relatively well-constrained sea-level (SL) record of the past
542 Myr (Phanerozoic eon). Given the possible link between amplitudes of the ~36 and ~250 Myr cyclicities
in SL record and the potential that these periodicities fall into the frequency band of solar system
motions, we suggest an astronomical origin, and model these periodicities as originating from
the path of the solar system in the Milky Way as vertical and radial periods that modulate the flux
of cosmic rays on Earth. Our finding of the ~36 Myr SL cyclicity lends credibility to the existing
hypothesis about the imprint of solar-system vertical period on the geological record. The ~250
Myr megacycles are tentatively attributed to a radial period. However, the tectonic drivers also
remain potentially plausible. The potential existence of a correlation between the modeled astronomical
signal and the geological record may offer an indirect proxy to understand the structure and history
of the Milky Way by providing a 542 Myr long record of the path of the Sun in our Galaxy.
