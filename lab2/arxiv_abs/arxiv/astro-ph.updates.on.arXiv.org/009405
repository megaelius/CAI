The recent multimessenger observation of the short gamma-ray burst (SGRB) GRB 170817A together
with the gravitational wave (GW) event GW170817 provides evidence for the long-standing hypothesis
associating SGRBs with binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. The nature of the remnant object powering
the SGRB, which could have been either an accreting black hole (BH) or a long-lived magnetized neutron
star (NS), is however still uncertain. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations
of the merger process represent a powerful tool to unravel the jet launching mechanism, but so far
most simulations focused the attention on a BH as central engine, while the long-lived NS scenario
remains poorly investigated. Here, we explore the latter by performing a GRMHD BNS merger simulation
extending up to ~100 ms after merger, much longer than any previous simulation of this kind. This
allows us to (i) study the emerging structure and amplification of the magnetic field and observe
a clear saturation at magnetic energy $E_\mathrm{mag} \sim 10^{51}$ erg, (ii) follow the magnetically
supported expansion of the outer layers of the remnant NS and its evolution into an ellipsoidal shape
without any surrounding torus, and (iii) monitor density, magnetization, and velocity along the
axis, observing no signs of jet formation. We also argue that the conditions at the end of the simulation
disfavor later jet formation on sub-second timescales if no BH is formed. Furthermore, we examine
the rotation profile of the remnant, the conversion of rotational energy associated with differential
rotation, the overall energy budget of the system, and the evolution of the GW frequency spectrum.
Finally, we perform an additional simulation where we induce the collapse to a BH ~70 ms after merger,
in order to gain insights on the prospects for massive accretion tori in case of late collapse. We
find that a mass...
