Several stars detected moving at velocities near to or exceeding the Galactic escape speed likely
originated in the Milky Way disc. We quantitatively explore the `binary supernova scenario' hypothesis,
wherein these `hyper-runaway' stars are ejected at large peculiar velocities when their close,
massive binary companions undergo a core-collapse supernova and the binary is disrupted. We perform
an extensive suite of binary population synthesis simulations evolving massive systems to determine
the assumptions and parameters which most impact the ejection rate of fast stars. In a simulation
tailored to eject fast stars, we find the most likely hyper-runaway star progenitor binary is composed
of a massive ($\sim$$30\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) primary and a $\sim$$3-4\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$
companion on an orbital period that shrinks to $\lesssim$1 day prior to the core collapse following
a common envelope phase. The black hole remnant formed from the primary must receive a natal kick
$\gtrsim$1000 $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$ to disrupt the binary and eject the companion at a large velocity.
We compare the fast stars produced in these simulations to a contemporary census of early-type Milky
Way hyper-runaway star candidates. We find that these rare objects may be produced in sufficient
number only when poorly-constrained binary evolution parameters related to the strength of post-core
collapse remnant natal kicks and common envelope efficiency are adjusted to values currently unsupported
-- but not excluded -- by the literature. We discuss observational implications that may constrain
the existence of these putative progenitor systems.
