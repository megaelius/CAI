A former member of the Hyades cluster, $\iota$ Horologii ($\iota$ Hor) is a planet-hosting Sun-like
star which displays the shortest coronal activity cycle known to date ($P_{\rm cyc}\sim$ 1.6 yr).
With an age of $\sim$$625$ Myr, $\iota$ Hor is also the youngest star with a detected activity cycle.
The study of its magnetic properties holds the potential to provide fundamental information to
understand the origin of cyclic activity and stellar magnetism in late-type stars. In this series
of articles, we present the results of a comprehensive project aimed at studying the evolving magnetic
field in this star and how this evolution influences its circumstellar environment. This paper
summarizes the first stage of this investigation, with results from a long-term observing campaign
of $\iota$ Hor using ground-based high-resolution spectropolarimetry. The analysis includes
precise measurements of the magnetic activity and radial velocity of the star, and their multiple
time-scales of variability. In combination with values reported in the literature, we show that
the long-term chromospheric activity evolution of $\iota$ Hor follows a beating pattern, caused
by the superposition of two periodic signals of similar amplitude at $P_{1} \simeq 1.97 \pm 0.02$
yr and $P_{2} \simeq 1.41 \pm 0.01$ yr. Additionally, using the most recent parameters for $\iota$
Hor b in combination with our activity and radial velocity measurements, we find that stellar activity
dominates the radial velocity residuals, making the detection of additional planets in this system
challenging. Finally, we report here the first measurements of the surface longitudinal magnetic
field strength of $\iota$ Hor, which displays varying amplitudes within $\pm4$ G and served to estimate
the rotation period of the star ($P_{\rm rot} =~7.70^{+0.18}_{-0.67}$ d).
