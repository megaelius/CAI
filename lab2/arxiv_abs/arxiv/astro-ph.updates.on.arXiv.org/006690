The Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer (MSE) project will transform the CFHT 3.6m optical telescope
to a 10m class dedicated multi-object spectroscopic facility, with an ability to measure thousands
of objects with three spectral resolution modes respectively low resolution of R~3,000, moderate
resolution of R~6,000 and high resolution of R~40,000. Two identical multi-object high resolution
spectrographs are expected to simultaneously produce 1084 spectra with high resolution of 40,000
at Blue (401-416nm) and Green (472-489nm) channels, and 20,000 at Red (626-674nm) channel. At the
Conceptual Design Phase (CoDP), different optical schemes were proposed to meet the challenging
requirements, especially a unique design with a novel transmission image slicer array, and another
conventional design with oversize Volume Phase Holographic (VPH) gratings. It became clear during
the CoDP that both designs presented problems of complexity or feasibility of manufacture, especially
high line density disperser (general name for all kinds of grating, grism, prism). At the present,
a new design scheme is proposed for investigating the optimal way to reduce technical risk and get
more reliable estimation of cost and timescale. It contains new dispersers, F/2 fast collimator
and so on. Therein, the disperser takes advantage of a special grism and a prism to reduce line density
on grating surface, keep wide opening angle of optical path, and get the similar spectrum layout
in all three spectral channels. For the fast collimator, it carefully compares on-axis and off-axis
designs in throughput, interface to fiber assembly and technical risks. The current progress is
more competitive and credible than the previous design, but it also indicates more challenging
work will be done to improve its accessibility in engineering.
