Motivated by unexplained observations of low sulphur abundances in planetary nebulae (PNe) and
the PG1159 class of post asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, we investigate the possibility that
sulphur may be destroyed by nucleosynthetic processes in low-to-intermediate mass stars during
stellar evolution. We use a 3 Msun, Z=0.01 evolutionary sequence to examine the consequences of
high and low reaction rate estimates of neutron captures onto sulphur and neighbouring elements.
In addition, we have tested high and low rates for the neutron producing reactions C13(alpha,n)O16
and Ne22(alpha,n)Mg25. We vary the mass width of a partially mixed zone (PMZ), which is responsible
for the formation of a C13 pocket and is the site of the C13(alpha,n)O16 neutron source. We test PMZ
masses from zero up to an extreme upper limit of the entire He-intershell mass at 10^-2 Msun. We find
that the alternative reaction rates and variations to the partially mixed zone have almost no effect
on surface sulphur abundances and do not reproduce the anomaly. To understand the effect of initial
mass on our conclusions, 1.8 Msun and 6 Msun evolutionary sequences are also tested with similar
results for sulphur abundances. We are able to set a constraint on the size of the PMZ, as PMZ sizes
that are greater than half of the He-intershell mass (in the 3 Msun model) are excluded by comparison
with neon abundances in planetary nebulae. We compare the 1.8 Msun model's intershell abundances
with observations of PG1159-035, whose surface abundances are thought to reflect the intershell
composition of a progenitor AGB star. We find general agreement between the patterns of F, Ne, Si,
P, and Fe abundances and a very large discrepancy for sulphur where our model predicts abundances
that are 30-40 times higher than is observed in the star.
