To fully harvest the rich library of stellar elemental abundance data available, we require reliable
models that facilitate our interpretation of them. Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models are
one such set, and a key part of which are the selection of chemical yields from different nucleosynthetic
enrichment channels, predominantly asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, Type Ia supernovae (SNe
Ia), and core-collapse supernovae (CC-SNe). Here, we present a scoring system for yield tables
based on their ability to reproduce proto-solar abundances within a simple parametrisation of
the GCE modelling software Chempy, which marginalises over galactic parameters describing simple
stellar populations (SSPs) and interstellar medium physics. Two statistical scoring methods
are presented, based on Bayesian evidence and leave-one-out cross-validation and are applied
to five CC-SN tables; (a) for all mutually available elements and (b) for a subset of the 9 most abundant
elements. We find that the yields of Prantzos et al. (P18, including stellar rotation) and Chieffi
& Limongi (C04) best reproduce proto-solar abundances for the two cases, respectively. The inferred
best-fit SSP parameters for (b) are $\alpha_\mathrm{IMF}=-2.45^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$ for the initial
mass function high-mass slope and $\mathrm{N}_\mathrm{Ia}=1.29^{+0.45}_{-0.31}\times10^{-3}$
M$_\odot^{-1}$ for the SN Ia normalisation, which are broadly consistent across tested yield tables.
Additionally, we demonstrate how Chempy can be used to dramatically improve elemental abundance
predictions of hydrodynamical simulations by plugging tailored best-fit SSP parameters into
a Milky Way analogue from Gutcke & Springel. Our code, including a comprehensive tutorial, is freely
available and can additionally provide SSP enrichment tables for any combination of parameters
and yield tables.
