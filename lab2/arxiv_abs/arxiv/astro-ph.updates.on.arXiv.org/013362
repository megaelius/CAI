The role of ionization feedback on high-mass (>8 Msun) star formation (HMSF) is still highly debated.
Questions remain concerning the presence of nearby HII regions changes the properties of early
HMSF and whether HII regions promote or inhibit the formation of high-mass stars. To characterize
the role of HII regions on the HMSF, we study the properties of a sample of candidates high-mass starless
clumps (HMSCs), of which about 90% have masses larger than 100 Msun. These high-mass objects probably
represent the earliest stages of HMSF; we search if (and how) their properties are modified by the
presence of an HII region. We took advantage of the recently published catalog of HMSC candidates.
By cross matching the HMSCs and HII regions, we classified HMSCs into three categories: 1) The HMSCs
associated with HII regions both in the position in the projected plane of the sky and in velocity;
2) HMSCs associated in the plane of the sky, but not in velocity; and 3) HMSCs far away from any HII regions
in the projected sky plane. We carried out comparisons between associated and nonassociated HMSCs
based on statistical analyses of multiwavelength data from infrared to radio. Statistical analyses
suggest that HMSCs associated with HII regions are warmer, more luminous, more centrally-peaked
and turbulent. We also clearly show, for the first time, that the ratio of bolometric luminosity
to envelope mass of HMSCs (L/M) could not be a reliable evolutionary probe for early HMSF due to the
external heating effects of the HII regions. More centrally peaked and turbulent properties of
HMSCs associated with HII regions may promote the formation of high-mass stars by limiting fragmentation.
High resolution interferometric surveys toward HMSCs are crucial to reveal how HII regions impact
the star formation process inside HMSCs.
