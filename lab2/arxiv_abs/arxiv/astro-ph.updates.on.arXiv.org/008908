In a recent letter [N. V. Krishnendu et al., PRL 119, 091101 (2017)] we explored the possibility of
probing the binary black hole nature of coalescing compact binaries, by measuring their spin-induced
multipole moments, observed in advanced LIGO detectors. Coefficients characterizing the spin-induced
multipole moments of Kerr black holes are predicted by the "no-hair" conjecture and appear in the
gravitational waveforms through quadratic and higher order spin interactions and hence can be
directly measured from gravitational wave observations. We assess the capabilities of the third-generation
gravitational wave interferometers such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope in carrying
out such measurements and use them to test the binary black hole nature of observed binaries. In this
paper, we extend the investigations of our previous work, by proposing to measure (a) spin-induced
quadrupole effects, (b) simultaneous measurements of spin-induced quadrupole and octupole effects,
in the context of the third-generation detectors. We find that, using third-generation detectors
the symmetric combination of coefficients associated with spin-induced quadrupole moment of
each binary component may be constrained to a value $\leq 1.1$ while a similar combination of coefficients
for spin-induced octupole moment may be constrained to $\leq 2$, where both combinations take the
value of 1 for a binary black hole system. Further, we consider two different binary black hole populations,
as proxies of the population that will be observed by the third generation detectors, and obtain
the resulting distribution of the spin-induced quadrupole coefficient. These estimates suggest
that third-generation detectors can accurately constrain the first four multipole moments of
the compact objects (mass, spin, quadrupole, and octupole) facilitating a thorough probe of their
black hole nature.
