We study the influence of strong magnetic fields in hybrid stars, composed by hadrons and a pure quark
matter core, and analyse their structure and stability as well as some possible evolution channels
due to the magnetic field decay. Using an ad-hoc parametrisation of the magnetic field strength
and taking into account Landau-quantization effects in matter, we calculate hybrid magnetised
equations of state and some associated quantities, such as particle abundances and matter magnetisation,
for different sets of parameters and different magnetic field strengths. Moreover, we compute
the magnetised stable stellar configurations, the mass versus radius and the gravitational mass
versus central energy density relationships, the gravitational mass versus baryon mass diagram,
and the tidal deformability. Our results are in agreement with both, the $\sim 2M_\odot$ pulsars
and the data obtained from GW170817. In addition, we study the stability of stellar configurations
assuming that slow and rapid phase transitions occur at the sharp hadron-quark interface. We find
that, unlike in the rapid transition scenario, where $\partial M/\partial \epsilon_c < 0$ is a sufficient
condition for instability, in the slow transition scenario there exists a connected extended stable
branch beyond the maximum mass star, for which $\partial M/\partial \epsilon_c < 0$. Finally, analysing
the gravitational mass versus baryon mass relationship, we have calculated the energy released
in transitions between stable stellar configurations. We find that the inclusion of the magnetic
field and the existence of new stable branches allows the possibility of new channels of transitions
that fulfil the energy requirements to explain Gamma Ray Bursts.
