We present new, deep (245 ks) Chandra observations of the galaxy cluster Abell 1664 ($z = 0.1283$).
These images reveal rich structure, including elongation and accompanying compressions of the
X-ray isophotes in the NE-SW direction, suggesting that the hot gas is sloshing in the gravitational
potential. This sloshing has resulted in cold fronts, at distances of 55, 115 and 320 kpc from the
cluster center. Our results indicate that the core of A1664 is highly disturbed, as the global metallicity
and cooling time flatten at small radii, implying mixing on large scales. The central AGN appears
to have recently undergone a mechanical outburst, as evidenced by our detection of cavities. These
cavities are the X-ray manifestations of radio bubbles inflated by the AGN, and may explain the motion
of cold molecular CO clouds previously observed with ALMA. The estimated mechanical power of the
AGN, using the minimum energy required to inflate the cavities as a proxy, is $P_{\rm cav} = (1.1 \pm
1.0) \times 10^{44} $ erg s$^{-1}$, which may be enough to drive the molecular gas flows, and offset
the cooling luminosity of the ICM, at $L_{\rm cool} = (1.90 \pm0.01)\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$.
This mechanical power is orders of magnitude higher than the measured upper limit on the X-ray luminosity
of the central AGN, suggesting that its black hole may be extremely massive and/or radiatively inefficient.
We map temperature variations on the same spatial scale as the molecular gas, and find that the most
rapidly cooling gas is mostly coincident with the molecular gas reservoir centered on the BCG's
systemic velocity observed with ALMA and may be fueling cold accretion onto the central black hole.
