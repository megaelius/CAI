Minor mergers have been proposed as the driving mechanism for the size growth of quiescent galaxies
with decreasing redshift. The process whereby large star-forming galaxies quench and join the
quiescent population at the large size end has also been suggested as an explanation for this size
growth. Given the clear association of quenching with clusters, we explore this mechanism by studying
the structural properties of 23 spectroscopically identified recently quenched (or "poststarburst"
(PSB)) cluster galaxies at $z\sim1$. Despite clear PSB spectral signatures implying rapid and
violent quenching, $87\%$ of these galaxies have symmetric, undisturbed morphologies in the stellar
continuum. Remarkably, they follow a mass-size relation lying midway between the star-forming
and quiescent field relations. This implies a rapid change in the light profile without directly
effecting the stellar distribution, suggesting changes in the mass-to-light ratio gradients
across the galaxy are responsible. We develop fading toy models to explore how star-forming galaxies
move across the mass-size plane as their stellar populations fade to match those of the PSBs. Modelling
a galaxy with a bulge+disc, and fading the disc from the "outside-in", can lead to the contraction
in size and increase in bulge-dominance observed between star-forming and PSB cluster galaxies.
Since cluster PSBs lie on the large size end of the quiescent mass-size relation, and our previous
work shows cluster galaxies are smaller than field galaxies, the sizes of quiescent galaxies must
grow both from the quenching of star-forming galaxies and dry minor mergers.
