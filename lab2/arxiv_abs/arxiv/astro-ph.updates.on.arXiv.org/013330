We investigate the ionised gas kinematics, physical properties and chemical abundances of SDSS$J$142947,
a Green Pea galaxy at redshift z$\sim$0.17 with strong, double-peak Ly$\alpha$ emission and indirect
evidence of Lyman continuum (LyC) leakage. Using high-dispersion spectroscopy, we perform a multi-component
analysis of emission-line profiles. Our model consistently fits all lines as a narrow component
with intrinsic velocity dispersion $\sigma \sim$40 km s$^{-1}$, and two broader blue-shifted
components with $\sigma \sim$90 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sim$250 km s$^{-1}$. We find electron densities
and temperatures, ionisation conditions, and direct O/H and N/O abundances for each component.
A highly ionised, metal-poor, young and compact starburst dominates narrow emission, showing
evidence of hard radiation fields and elevated N/O. The blue-shifted broader components are consistent
with highly turbulent, possibly clumpy ionised gas at the base of a strong photoionised outflow,
which accounts for $\gtrsim$50% of the integrated emission-line fluxes. The outflow is dense and
metal-enriched compared to the HII regions, with expansion velocities larger than those obtained
from UV interstellar absorption lines under standard assumptions. Some of these metals may be able
to escape, with outflows loading factors comparable to those found in high-$z$ galaxies of similar
SFR/Area. Our findings depict a two-stage starburst picture; hard radiation fields from young
star clusters illuminate a turbulent and clumpy ISM that has been eroded by SNe feedback. While UV
data suggest an extended Ly$\alpha$ halo with high average HI column density, LyC photons could
only escape from SDSS$J$142947 through low HI density channels or filaments in the ISM approaching
density-bounded conditions, traced by outflowing gas.
