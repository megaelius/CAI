While the width-luminosity relation among type Ia supernovae (slower is brighter) is one of the
best studied properties of this type of events, its physical basis has not been identified convincingly.
The 'luminosity' is known to be related to a clear physical quantity - the amount of $^{56}$Ni synthesised,
but the 'width' has not been quantitatively linked yet to a physical time scale. In Paper I it was shown
that the gamma-ray escape time $t_0$, which determines the long term evolution of the bolometric
light curve, can be robustly inferred from observations, and its observed values span a narrow range
of 30-45 days for the full range of observed $^{56}$Ni masses. In this paper we show that the recombination
time of $^{56}$Fe and $^{56}$Co from doubly to singly ionized states causes the typical observed
break in the color curve B-V due to a cliff in the mean opacities, and is a robust width measure of the
light curve, which is insensitive to radiation transfer uncertainties. We show that a simple photospheric
model can be used to calculate the recombination time to an accuracy of $\sim5$ days, allowing a quantitative
understanding of the color WLR. The two physical times scales of the width luminosity relation are
shown to be set by two (direction averaged and $^{56}$Ni weighted) column densities- the total column
density which sets $t_0$ and the $^{56}$Ni column density which sets the recombination time. Central
detonations of sub-$\rm M_{ch}$ WDs and direct WD collision models have gamma-ray escape times
and recombination times which are consistent with observations across the luminosity range of
type Ia's. Delayed detonation Chandrasekhar mass models have recombination times that are broadly
consistent with observations, with tension at the bright end of the luminosity range and inconsistent
gamma-ray escape times at the faint end.
