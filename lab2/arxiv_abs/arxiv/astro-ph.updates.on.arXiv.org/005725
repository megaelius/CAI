We present the first application of a bin-scheme microphysical and vertical transport model to
determine the size distribution of titanium and silicate cloud particles in the atmospheres of
hot Jupiters. We predict particle size distributions from first principles for a grid of planets
at four representative equatorial longitudes, and investigate how observed cloud properties
depend on the atmospheric thermal structure and vertical mixing. The predicted size distributions
are frequently bimodal and irregular in shape. There is a negative correlation between total cloud
mass and equilibrium temperature as well as a positive correlation between total cloud mass and
atmospheric mixing. The cloud properties on the east and west limbs show distinct differences that
increase with increasing equilibrium temperature. Cloud opacities are roughly constant across
a broad wavelength range with the exception of features in the mid-infrared. Forward scattering
is found to be important across the same wavelength range. Using the fully resolved size distribution
of cloud particles as opposed to a mean particle size has a distinct impact on the resultant cloud
opacities. The particle size that contributes the most to the cloud opacity depends strongly on
the cloud particle size distribution. We predict that it is unlikely that silicate or titanium clouds
are responsible for the optical Rayleigh scattering slope seen in many hot Jupiters. We suggest
that cloud opacities in emission may serve as sensitive tracers of the thermal state of a planet's
deep interior through the existence or lack of a cold trap in the deep atmosphere.
