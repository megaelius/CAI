RadioAstron is a 10 m orbiting radio telescope mounted on the Spektr-R satellite, launched in 2011,
performing Space Very Long Baseline Interferometry (SVLBI) observations supported by a global
ground array of radio telescopes. With an apogee of about 350 000 km, it is offering for the first time
the possibility to perform {\mu}as-resolution imaging in the cm-band. We present observations
at 22 GHz of 3C 273, performed in 2014, designed to reach a maximum baseline of approximately nine
Earth diameters. Reaching an angular resolution of 0.3 mas, we study a particularly low-activity
state of the source, and estimate the nuclear region brightness temperature, comparing with the
extreme one detected one year before during the RadioAstron early science period. We also make use
of the VLBA-BU-BLAZAR survey data, at 43 GHz, to study the kinematics of the jet in a 1.5-year time
window. We find that the nuclear brightness temperature is two orders of magnitude lower than the
exceptionally high value detected in 2013 with RadioAstron at the same frequency (1.4x10^13 K,
source-frame), and even one order of magnitude lower than the equipartition value. The kinematics
analysis at 43 GHz shows that a new component was ejected 2 months after the 2013 epoch, visible also
in our 22 GHz map presented here. Consequently this was located upstream of the core during the brightness
temperature peak. These observations confirm that the previously detected extreme brightness
temperature in 3C 273, exceeding the inverse Compton limit, is a short-lived phenomenon caused
by a temporary departure from equipartition. Thus, the availability of interferometric baselines
capable of providing {\mu}as angular resolution does not systematically imply measured brightness
temperatures over the known physical limits for astrophysical sources.
