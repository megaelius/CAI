We use IllustrisTNG, a suite of gravity and MHD simulations, to study the demographics and properties
of jellyfish galaxies in the full cosmological context. By jellyfish galaxies, we mean satellites
orbiting in massive groups and clusters that exhibit highly asymmetric distributions of gas and
gas tails. We use the TNG100 run and select galaxies at redshifts $z\le0.6$ with stellar mass exceeding
$10^{9.5}{\rm M_\odot}$ and with host halo masses of $10^{13}-10^{14.6}\,{\rm M_\odot}$. Among
more than about 6000 (2600) galaxies with stars (and some gas), we identify 800 jellyfish galaxies
by visually inspecting their gas and stellar mass maps in random projections. About $31\%$ of cluster
satellites are found with signatures of ram-pressure stripping and gaseous tails stemming from
the main luminous bodies. This is a lower limit, since the random orientation entails a loss of about
$30\%$ of galaxies that in an optimal projection would otherwise be identified as jellyfish. The
connection with ram-pressure stripping is further confirmed by a series of findings: jellyfish
galaxies are more frequent at intermediate and large cluster-centric distances ($r/R_{\rm 200c}\gtrsim
0.25$); they move through the ICM with larger bulk velocities and Mach numbers than the general cluster
population, typically orbiting supersonically and experiencing larger ram pressures. Furthermore,
the gaseous tails usually extend in opposite directions to the galaxy trajectory, with no relation
between tail orientation and the host's center. The frequency of jellyfish galaxies shows a very
weak dependence on redshift $(0\le z\le0.6)$ but larger fractions of disturbed gaseous morphologies
occur in more massive hosts and at smaller satellite masses. Finally, jellyfish galaxies are late
infallers ($< 2.5-3$ Gyrs ago, at $z=0$) and the emergence of gaseous tails correlates well with
the presence of bow shocks in the ICM.
