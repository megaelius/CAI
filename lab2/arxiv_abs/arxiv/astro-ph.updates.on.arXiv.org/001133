We wish to investigate the structure, velocity field, and stellar content of the G16.59-0.05 high-mass
star-forming region, where previous studies have established the presence of two almost perpendicular
(NE-SW and SE-NW), massive outflows, and a rotating disk traced by methanol maser emission. We performed
Very Large Array observations of the radio continuum and ammonia line emission, complemented by
COMICS/Subaru and Hi-GAL/Herschel images in the mid- and far-infrared (IR). Our centimeter continuum
maps reveal a collimated radio jet that is oriented E-W and centered on the methanol maser disk, placed
at the SE border of a compact molecular core. The spectral index of the jet is negative, indicating
non-thermal emission over most of the jet, except the peak close to the maser disk, where thermal
free-free emission is observed. We find that the ammonia emission presents a bipolar structure
consistent (on a smaller scale) in direction and velocity with that of the NE-SW bipolar outflow
detected in previous CO observations. After analyzing our previous N2H+(1-0) observations again,
we conclude that two scenarios are possible. In one case both the radio jet and the ammonia emission
would trace the root of the large-scale CO bipolar outflow. The different orientation of the jet
and the ammonia flow could be explained by precession and/or a non-isotropic density distribution
around the star. In the other case, the N2H+(1-0) and ammonia bipolarity is interpreted as two overlapping
clumps moving with different velocities along the line of sight. The ammonia gas also seems to undergo
rotation consistent with the maser disk. Our IR images complemented by archival data allow us to
derive a bolometric luminosity of about 10^4 L_sun and to conclude that most of the luminosity is
due to the young stellar object associated with the maser disk.
