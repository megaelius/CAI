We study the clustering of galaxies (from ~ $0.1$ to a few tens Mpc scales) at high redshift ($z>7$)
using the BLUETIDES simulation and compare it to current constraints from Hubble legacy and Hyper
Suprime Cam (HSC) fields. BLUETIDES is the largest high resolution cosmological hydrodynamic
simulation with a box length of $400$ $Mpc/h$ and $0.7$ trillion particles (~ $3$ million star forming
galaxies). We select galaxies with magnitudes consistent with the observed fields (~ $10^5$ star
forming galaxies at $z$ ~ $8$) and measure their clustering. The 1-halo term dominates on scales
$r < 0.1$ $Mpc/h$ ($\Theta < 3"$) with non-linear effect at transition scales between the 1-halo
and 2-halo term affecting scales $0.1 < r < 20$ $Mpc/h$ ($3" < \Theta < 90"$). The predicted angular
clustering amplitude of BLUETIDES galaxies is in good agreement with current measurements. The
measured linear bias at $z = 8$ is $7.7 \pm 0.5$ (evolving close to linearly with redshift). This is
consistent with the inferred bias from observations. The typical halo masses are $M_H$ ~ $2 \times
10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}/h$, which is only slightly lower than that inferred from HOD models used to
constrain observed clustering. Using the simulations we show that the current clustering measurements
probe the transition between 1-halo to 2-halo regime so non-linear effects are important at all
scales. We measure a strong scale dependence in the bias at scales below a few Mpc/h ($\Theta < 30"$).
The occupation numbers for satellites in BLUETIDES is somewhat higher than standard HODs adopted
in these analyses. That should imply a higher number of galaxies detected by JWST observing these
fields. At $z$ ~ $8$ BLUETIDES predicts enhanced clustering (by factors ~ $2$) within the 1-halo
and 1-halo to 2-halo transition scales as compared to linear HOD models; these differences increase
(up to factor ~ $10$) at higher redshifts.
