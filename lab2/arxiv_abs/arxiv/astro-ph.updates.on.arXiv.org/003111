We aim to improve upon contemporary methods to estimate host-galaxy reddening of stripped-envelope
(SE) supernovae (SNe). To this end the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP-I) SE SNe photometry data
release, consisting of nearly three dozen objects, is used to identify a minimally reddened sub-sample
for each traditionally defined spectroscopic sub-types (i.e, SNe~IIb, SNe~Ib, SNe~Ic). Inspection
of the optical and near-infrared (NIR) colors and color evolution of the minimally reddened sub-samples
reveals a high degree of homogeneity, particularly between 0d to +20d relative to B-band maximum.
This motivated the construction of intrinsic color-curve templates, which when compared to the
colors of reddened SE SNe, yields an entire suite of optical and NIR color excess measurements. Comparison
of optical/optical vs. optical/NIR color excess measurements indicates the majority of the CSP-I
SE SNe suffer relatively low amounts of reddening and we find evidence for different R_(V)^(host)
values among different SE SN. Fitting the color excess measurements of the seven most reddened objects
with the Fitzpatrick (1999) reddening law model provides robust estimates of the host visual-extinction
A_(V)^(host) and R_(V)^(host). In the case of the SE SNe with relatively low amounts of reddening,
a preferred value of R_(V)^(host) is adopted for each sub-type, resulting in estimates of A_(V)^(host)
through Fitzpatrick (1999) reddening law model fits to the observed color excess measurements.
Our analysis suggests SE SNe reside in galaxies characterized by a range of dust properties. We also
find evidence SNe Ic are more likely to occur in regions characterized by larger R_(V)^(host) values
compared to SNe IIb/Ib and they also tend to suffer more extinction. These findings are consistent
with work in the literature suggesting SNe Ic tend to occur in regions of on-going star formation.
