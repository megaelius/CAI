We present a 350 micron APEX/SABOCA map of IRAS 05399-0121/SMM 1, which is a dense double-core system
in Orion B9. We combined these data with our previous LABOCA 870-micron data. The spatial resolution
of the new SABOCA image, ~3400 AU, is about 2.6 times better than provided by LABOCA. We also make use
of Spitzer infrared observations to characterise the star-formation activity in the source. The
source is filamentary and remains a double-core system on the 3400 AU scale probed here, where the
projected separation between IRAS 05399 and SMM 1 is 0.14 pc. The broadband spectral energy distribution
of IRAS 05399 suggests that it is near the Stage 0/I borderline. A visual inspection of the Spitzer/IRAC
images provides hints of a quadrupolar-like jet morphology around IRAS 05399, supporting the possibility
that it is a binary system. The temperature map reveals warm spots towards IRAS 05399 and the southeastern
tip of the source. These features are likely to be imprints of protostellar or shock heating, while
external heating could be provided by the nearby high-mass star-forming region NGC 2024. A simple
analysis suggests that the density profile at the position of SMM 1 has the form ~r^-(2.3_{-0.9}^{+2.2}).
The source splitting into two subcores along the long axis can be explained by cylindrical Jeans-type
fragmentation but the steepness of the density profile is shallower than what is expected for an
isothermal cylinder. The difference between the evolutionary stages of IRAS 05399 (protostellar)
and SMM 1 (starless) suggests that the former has experienced a phase of rapid mass accretion, supported
by the very long outflow it drives. The protostellar jet from IRAS 05399 might have influenced the
nearby core SMM 1.
