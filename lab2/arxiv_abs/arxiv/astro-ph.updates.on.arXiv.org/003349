Studies suggest that the pollution of white dwarf (WD) atmospheres arises from the accretion of
minor planets, but the exact properties of polluting material, and in particular the evidence for
water in some cases are not yet understood. Previous works studied the water retention in minor planets
around main-sequence and evolving host stars, in order to evaluate the possibility that water survives
inside minor planets around WDs. However, all of these studies focused on small, comet-sized to
moonlet-sized minor planets, when the inferred mass inside the convection zones of He-dominated
WDs could actually also be compatible with much more massive minor planets. In this study we therefore
explore for the first time, the water retention inside exo-planetary dwarf planets, or moderate-sized
moons, with radii of the order of hundreds of kilometres. We now cover nearly the entire potential
mass range of minor planets. The rest of the parameter space considered in this study is identical
to that of our previous study, and also includes multiple WD progenitor star masses. We find that
water retention in more massive minor planets is still affected by the mass of the WD progenitor,
however not as much as when small minor planets were considered. We also find that water retention
is now almost always greater than zero. On average, the detected water fraction in He-dominated
WD atmospheres should be at least 5\%, irrespective of the assumed initial water composition, if
it came from a single accretion event of an icy dwarf planet or moon. This finding also strengthens
the possibility of WD habitability. To finalize our previous and current findings, we provide a
code which may be freely used as a service to the community. The code calculates ice and water retention
by interpolation, spanning the full mass range of both minor planets and their host stars.
