We study the detectability of the emission associated with the AGN dusty structure at sub-mm wavelengths
using ALMA, in a theoretical and observational way. Theoretically, we use the Clumpy models from
Nenkova et al. together with the mid-infrared to X-ray and the radio fundamental plane scaling relations.
We find that it is more likely to detect bigger and denser dusty tori at the highest ALMA frequency
(666 GHz/450 micron). We also find that with 1h at 353 GHz/850 micron and 10h at 666 GHz/450 micron
we can detect, with a high detection limit, a 1 mJy torus (characteristic of bright AGN). This means,
an object for which the unresolved SED at 12 micron has a flux ~1mJy. Observationally, we use four
prototypical AGN: NGC\,1052 (low-luminosity AGN), NGC\,1068 (Type-2), NGC\,3516 (Type 1.5),
and IZw1 (QSO), with radio, sub-millimeter, and mid-IR data available. All the mid-infrared spectra
are best fit with the smooth model reported by Fritz et al. A power law and a single, or a composition
of, synchrotron component/s reproduce the cm radio wavelengths. We combined and extrapolated
both fits to compare the extrapolation of both torus and jet contributors at sub-mm wavelengths
with data at these wavelengths. Our observational results are consistent with our theoretical
results. The most promising candidate to detect the torus is the QSO IZw1 (therefore, highly accreting
sources in general), although it cannot be resolved due to the distance of this source. We suggest
that to explore the detection of a torus at sub-mm wavelengths, it is necessary to perform an SED analysis
including radio data, with particular attention to the angular resolution.
