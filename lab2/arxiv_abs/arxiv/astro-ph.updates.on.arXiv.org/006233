In galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lensing, Einstein rings are generated when the lensing
galaxy has an axisymmetric lensing potential and the source galaxy is aligned with its symmetry
centre along the line of sight. Using a Taylor expansion around the Einstein radius and eliminating
the unknown source, I derive a set of analytic equations that determine differences of the deflection
angle of the perturber weighted by the convergence of the axisymmetric lens and ratios of the convergences
at the positions of the arcs from the measurable thickness of the arcs. In the same manner, asymmetries
in the brightness distributions along an arc determine differences in the deflection angle of the
perturber if the source has a symmetric brightness profile and is oriented parallel to or orthogonal
to the caustic. These equations are the only model-independent information retrievable from observations
to leading order in the Taylor expansion. General constraints on the derivatives of the perturbing
lens are derived such that the perturbation does not change the number of critical curves. To infer
physical properties such as the mass of the perturber or its position, models need to be inserted.
The same conclusions about the scale of detectable masses and model-dependent degeneracies as
in other approaches are then found and supported by analysing B1938 as an example. Yet, the model-independent
equations show that there is a fundamental degeneracy between the main lens and the perturber that
can only be broken if their relative position is known. This explains the degeneracies between lens
models already found in simulations from a more general viewpoint. Depending on the properties
of the pertuber, this degeneracy can be broken by characterising the surrounding of the lens or by
measuring the time delay between quasar images embedded in the perturbed Einstein ring of the host
galaxy.
