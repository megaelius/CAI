Using stellar population models, we predicted that the Dark Energy Survey (DES) - due to its special
combination of area (5000 deg. sq.) and depth ($i = 24.3$) - would be in the position to detect massive
($\gtrsim 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$) galaxies at $z \sim 4$. We confront those theoretical calculations
with the first $\sim 150$ deg. sq. of DES data reaching nominal depth. From a catalogue containing
$\sim 5$ million sources, $\sim26000$ were found to have observed-frame $g-r$ vs $r-i$ colours
within the locus predicted for $z \sim 4$ massive galaxies. We further removed contamination by
stars and artefacts, obtaining 606 galaxies lining up by the model selection box. We obtained their
photometric redshifts and physical properties by fitting model templates spanning a wide range
of star formation histories, reddening and redshift. Key to constrain the models is the addition,
to the optical DES bands $g$, $r$, $i$, $z$, and $Y$, of near-IR $J$, $H$, $K_{s}$ data from the Vista
Hemisphere Survey. We further applied several quality cuts to the fitting results, including goodness
of fit and a unimodal redshift probability distribution. We finally select 233 candidates whose
photometric redshift probability distribution function peaks around $z\sim4$, have high stellar
masses ($\log($M$^{*}$/M$_{\odot})\sim 11.7$ for a Salpeter IMF) and ages around 0.1 Gyr, i.e.
formation redshift around 5. These properties match those of the progenitors of the most massive
galaxies in the local universe. This is an ideal sample for spectroscopic follow-up to select the
fraction of galaxies which is truly at high redshift. These initial results and those at the survey
completion, which we shall push to higher redshifts, will set unprecedented constraints on galaxy
formation, evolution, and the re-ionisation epoch.
