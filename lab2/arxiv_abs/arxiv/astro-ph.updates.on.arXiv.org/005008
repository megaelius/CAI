Stars are born from dense cores in molecular clouds. Observationally, it is crucial to capture the
formation of cores in order to understand the necessary conditions and rate of the star formation
process. The {\it Atacama Large Mm/sub-mm Array} (ALMA) is extremely powerful for identifying
dense gas structures, including cores, at mm wavelengths via their dust continuum emission. Here
we use ALMA to carry out a survey of dense gas and cores in the central region of the massive ($\sim10^5\:M_\odot$)
Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) G28.37+0.07. The observation consists of a mosaic of 86 pointings of
the 12m-array and produces an unprecedented view of the densest structures of this IRDC. In this
first paper about this data set, we focus on a comparison between the 1.3 mm continuum emission and
a mid-infrared (MIR) extinction map of the IRDC. This allows estimation of the "dense gas" detection
probability function (DPF), i.e., as a function of the local mass surface density, $\Sigma$, for
various choices of thresholds of mm continuum emission to define "dense gas". We then estimate the
dense gas mass fraction, $f_{\rm dg}$, in the central region of the IRDC and, via extrapolation with
the DPF and the known $\Sigma$ probability distribution function, to the larger-scale surrounding
regions, finding values of about 5\% to 15\% for the fiducial choice of threshold. We argue that this
observed dense gas is a good tracer of the protostellar core population and, in this context, estimate
a star formation efficiency per free-fall time in the central IRDC region of $\epsilon_{\rm ff}\sim$10\%,
with approximately a factor of two systematic uncertainties.
