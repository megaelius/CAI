We present multiwavelength observations of the afterglow of GRB 130427A, the brightest (in total
fluence) gamma-ray burst of the past 29 years. Optical spectroscopy from Gemini-North reveals
the redshift of the GRB to be z=0.340, indicating that its unprecedented brightness is primarily
the result of its relatively close proximity to Earth; the intrinsic luminosities of both the GRB
and its afterglow are not extreme in comparison to other bright GRBs. We present a large suite of multiwavelength
observations spanning from 300 s to 130 d after the burst and demonstrate that the afterglow shows
relatively simple, smooth evolution at all frequencies with no significant late-time flaring
or rebrightening activity. The entire dataset from 1 GHz to 10 GeV can be modeled as synchrotron emission
from a combination of reverse and forward shocks in good agreement with the standard afterglow model,
providing strong support to the applicability of the underlying theory and clarifying the nature
of the GeV emission observed to last for minutes to hours following other very bright GRBs. A tenuous,
wind-stratified circumburst density profile is required by the observations, suggesting a massive-star
progenitor with a low mass-loss rate, perhaps due to low metallicity. GRBs similar in nature to GRB
130427A, inhabiting low-density media and exhibiting strong reverse shocks, are probably not
uncommon but may have been difficult to recognize in the past due to their relatively faint late-time
radio emission; more such events should be found in abundance by the new generation of sensitive
radio and millimeter instruments.
