We present the phase characteristics study of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) long (up to 3 km) baseline, which is the longest baseline tested so far using ALMA. The data
consist of long time-scale (10 - 20 minutes) measurements on a strong point source (i.e., bright
quasar) at various frequency bands (bands 3, 6, and 7, which correspond to the frequencies of about
88 GHz, 232 GHz, and 336 GHz). Water vapor radiometer (WVR) phase correction works well even at long
baselines, and the efficiency is better at higher PWV (>1 mm) condition, consistent with the
past studies. We calculate the spatial structure function of phase fluctuation, and display that
the phase fluctuation (i.e., rms phase) increases as a function of baseline length, and some data
sets show turn-over around several hundred meters to 1 km and being almost constant at longer baselines.
This is the first millimeter/submillimeter structure function at this long baseline length, and
to show the turn-over of the structure function. Furthermore, the observation of the turn-over
indicates that even if the ALMA baseline length extends to the planned longest baseline of 15 km,
fringes will be detected at a similar rms phase fluctuation as that at a few km baseline lengths. We
also calculate the coherence time using the 3 km baseline data, and the results indicate that the
coherence time for band 3 is longer than 400 seconds in most of the data (both in the raw and WVR-corrected
data). For bands 6 and 7, WVR-corrected data have about twice longer coherence time, but it is better
to use fast switching method to avoid the coherence loss.
