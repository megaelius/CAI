We present new high-resolution and high-sensitivity studies of the jets in the WAT source 3C 465,
using deep transverse-resolved radio observations from e-MERLIN, and with complementary observations
from the VLA. We derive a lower limit $\beta_{\rm j}$ = ($\nu_{\rm j}$/$c$) $\gtrsim$ 0.5 for the
jet speed, and an upper limit $\theta_{\rm j}$ $\lesssim$ 61$^{\circ}$ for the jet angle to the line
of sight. The jet spectral index ($\alpha$, defined in the sense $S \propto \nu^{\alpha}$) is fairly
constant (<$\alpha_{\rm jet}$> = $-$0.7), and spectral flattening within 4.4 kpc of the core coincides
with bright knots and is consistent with the site of X-ray particle acceleration at the base of the
radio jet found in previous studies. There is little difference between the spectra of the two hotspot
components, plausibly indicating that electron populations of the same properties are injected
there. The NW and SE plumes are approximately homologous structures, with variations in mass injection
and propagation in external pressure and density gradients in the two regions plausibly accounting
for the slightly steeper spectrum in the NW plume, <$\alpha_{\rm NWp}$> = $-$1.43 compared with
the SE plume, <$\alpha_{\rm SEp}$> = $-$1.38. Our synchrotron lifetime model supports plausible
reacceleration of particles within the plume materials. Overall, our results show that the first-order
Fermi process at mildly relativistic and non-relativistic shocks is the most likely acceleration
mechanism at play in 3C 465 and distinguish differences between the acceleration at $\beta_{\rm
j}$ $>$ 0.5 and $\beta_{\rm j}$ $<$ 0.5. The former case can accelerate electrons to higher Lorentz
factors.
