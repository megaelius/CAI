Based on numbers of stars, supernova rates, and metallicity, a prior study (Dayal et al. 2015) concluded
that large elliptical galaxies contain up to 10,000 times more habitable planets than the Milky
Way and are thus the "cradles of life". Using the results of their model and taking into account galactic
number distributions and supernova rates I argue here that this result constitutes a violation
of the Principle of Mediocrity as applied to the reference class of all extant technological species.
Assuming that we are a typical technological species in the attribute of inhabiting a relatively
large disk-dominated galaxy, I outline two hypotheses that could significantly limit the habitability
of large elliptical galaxies: (1) massive galactic sterilization events associated with quasar/AGN
activity and starburst supernovae that occurred when the antecedents of today's large elliptical
galaxies were much more compact; and (2) the probability of habitable planet formation in large
elliptical galaxies may be small since a disproportionately larger number of gaseous planets are
expected to form as a result of the generally higher metallicity in large elliptical galaxies. Consequently,
fewer habitable planets will accrete if the gaseous planets inward migrations are sufficiently
slow. The sterilization events of Hypothesis (1) occurred at earlier epochs (z $\geq$ 1) and so they
must be effectively permanent, implying two possible scenarios regarding the origin and evolution
of life. In connection with one of these scenarios, independent applications of the Principle of
Mediocrity suggest that M-dwarf stars are not significant hosts of technological life.
