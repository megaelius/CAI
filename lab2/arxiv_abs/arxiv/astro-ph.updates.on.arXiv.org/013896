In globular clusters, blue straggler stars are heavier than the average star, so dynamical friction
strongly affects them. The radial distribution of BSS, normalized to a reference population, appears
bimodal in a fraction of Galactic GCs, with a density peak in the core, a prominent zone of avoidance
at intermediate radii, and again higher density in the outskirts. The zone of avoidance appears
to be located at larger radii the more relaxed the host cluster, acting as a sort of dynamical clock.
We use a new method to compute the evolution of the BSS radial distribution under dynamical friction
and diffusion. We evolve our BSS in the mean cluster potential under dynamical friction plus a random
fluctuating force, solving the Langevin equation with the Mannella quasi symplectic scheme. This
amounts to a new simulation method which is much faster and simpler than direct N-body codes but retains
their main feature: diffusion powered by strong, if infrequent, kicks. We compute the radial distribution
of initially unsegregated BSS normalized to a reference population as a function of time. We trace
the evolution of its minimum, corresponding to the zone of avoidance. We compare the evolution under
kicks extracted from a Gaussian distribution to that obtained using a Holtsmark distribution.
The latter is a fat tailed distribution which correctly models the effects of close gravitational
encounters. We find that the zone of avoidance moves outwards over time, as expected based on observations,
only when using the Holtsmark distribution. Thus the correct representation of near encounters
is crucial to reproduce the dynamics of the system. We confirm and extend earlier results that showed
how the dynamical clock indicator depends both on dynamical friction and effective diffusion powered
by dynamical encounters.
