Both multi-messenger astronomy and new high-throughput wide-field surveys require flexible
tools for the selection and analysis of astrophysical transients. We here introduce the Alert Management,
Photometry and Evaluation of Lightcurves (AMPEL) system, an analysis framework designed for high-throughput
surveys and suited for streamed data. AMPEL combines the functionality of an alert broker with a
generic framework capable of hosting user-contributed code, that encourages provenance and keeps
track of the varying information states that a transient displays. The latter concept includes
information gathered over time and data policies such as access or calibration levels. We describe
a novel ongoing real-time multi-messenger analysis using AMPEL to combine IceCube neutrino data
with the alert streams of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We also reprocess the first four months
of ZTF public alerts, and compare the yields of more than 200 different transient selection functions
to quantify efficiencies for selecting Type Ia supernovae that were reported to the Transient Name
Server (TNS). We highlight three channels suitable for (1) the collection of a complete sample of
extragalactic transients, (2) immediate follow-up of nearby transients and (3) follow-up campaigns
targeting young, extragalactic transients. We confirm ZTF completeness in that all TNS supernovae
positioned on active CCD regions were detected. AMPEL can assist in filtering transients in real
time, running alert reaction simulations, the reprocessing of full datasets as well as in the final
scientific analysis of transient data. This text introduces how users can design their own channels
for inclusion in the AMPEL live instance that parses the ZTF stream and the real-time submission
of high quality extragalactic supernova candidates to the TNS.
