We present the results from ALMA observations of [NII]205 micron, [CII]158 micron, and [OII]88
micron lines in an unlensed submillimeter galaxy at z=4.3, COSMOS-AzTEC-1, hosting a compact starburst
core with an effective radius of 1 kpc. The [CII] and [NII] emission are spatially-resolved in 0.3
arcsec-resolution (1 kpc in radius). The kinematic properties of the [NII] emission are consistent
with those of the CO(4-3) and [CII] emission, suggesting that the ionized gas feels the same gravitational
potential as the associated molecular gas and photodissociation regions (PDRs). On the other hand,
the spatial extent is different among the lines and dust continuum: the [CII] emitting gas is the
most extended and the dust is the most compact, leading to a difference of the physical conditions
in the interstellar medium. We derive the incident far-ultraviolet flux and the hydrogen gas density
through PDR modeling by properly subtracting the contribution of ionized gas to the total [CII]
emission. The observed [CII] emission is likely produced by dense PDRs with nH(PDR)=10^(5.5-5.75)
cm^-3 and G0=10^(3.5-3.75) in the central 1 kpc region and nH(PDR)=10^(5.0-5.25) cm^-3 and G0=10^(3.25-3.5)
in the central 3 kpc region. We have also successfully measured the line ratio of [OIII/[NII] in the
central 3 kpc region of COSMOS-AzTEC-1 at z=4.3, which is the highest redshift where both nitrogen
and oxygen lines are detected. Under the most likely physical conditions, the measured luminosity
ratio of L([OIII])/L([NII])=6.4+-2.2 indicates a near solar metallicity with Zgas=0.7-1.0 Zsol,
suggesting a chemically evolved system at z=4.3.
