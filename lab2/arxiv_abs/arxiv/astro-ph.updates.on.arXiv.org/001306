The early X-ray afterglow of gamma-ray bursts revealed by Swift carried many surprises. We focus
in this paper on the plateau phase whose origin remains highly debated. We confront several newly
discovered correlations between prompt and afterglow quantities (isotropic emitted energy in
gamma-rays, luminosity and duration of the plateau) to several models proposed for the origin of
plateaus in order to check if they can account for these observed correlations. We first show that
the scenario of plateau formation by energy injection into the forward shock leads to an efficiency
crisis for the prompt phase and therefore study two possible alternatives: the first one still takes
place within the framework of the standard forward shock model but allows for a variation of the microphysics
parameters to reduce the radiative efficiency at early times; in the second scenario the early afterglow
results from a long-lived reverse shock. Its shape then depends on the distribution of energy as
a function of Lorentz factor in the ejecta. In both cases, we first present simple analytical estimates
of the plateau luminosity and duration and then compute detailed light curves. In the two considered
scenarios we find that plateaus following the observed correlations can be obtained under the condition
that specific additional ingredients are included. In the forward shock scenario, the preferred
model supposes a wind external medium and a microphysics parameter epsilon_e that first varies
as n^{-\nu} (n being the external density), with \nu~1 to get a flat plateau, before staying constant
below a critical density n_0. To produce a plateau in the reverse shock scenario the ejecta must contain
a tail of low Lorentz factor with a peak of energy deposition at \Gamma >~ 10.
