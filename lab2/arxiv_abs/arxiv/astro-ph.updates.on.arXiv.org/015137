The Kibble-Lazarides-Shafi (KLS) domain wall problem in the axion solution of CP violation in QCD
has condensed-matter based analogy in the nafen-distorted superfluid $^3$He. Recent experiment
in rotating superfluid $^3$He produced the network of KLS string walls in human controllable system.
In this system, KLS string wall appears in two-step symmetry break transition from normal phase
to polar-distorted B phase and turn out to be the descendants of HQVs of polar phase. Here we show the
KLS string wall smoothly connects to spin solitons when the spin orbital coupling is taken into account.
This means HQVs are 1D nexus which connects the spin solitons and the KLS domain walls. This is because
the subgroup $G=\pi_{1}(S_{S}^{1},\tilde{R}_{2})$ of relative homotopy group describing the
spin solitons is isomorphic to the group describing the half spin vortices -- the spin textures KLS
string wall. In the nafen-distorted $^3$He system, 1D nexus objects and the spin solitons with topological
invariant $2/4$ form two different types of network, which are named as pseudo-random lattices
of inseparable and separable spin solitons. These two types lattices correspond to two different
representations of $G$. We discuss the condition under which pseudo-random lattices model works.
The equilibrium configuration and surface densities of free energies are calculated by numeric
minimization. Based on the equilibrium spin textures of different pseudo-random lattices, we
calculated their transverse NMR spectrum, the resulted frequency shifts and $\sqrt{\Omega}$-scaling
of ratio intensity exactly coincide with the experimental measurements. We also discussed the
mirror symmetry in the presence of KLS domain wall and the influence of the explicitly break of this
discrete symmetry. Our discussions and considerations can be applied to the composite defects
in other condensed matter and cosmological system.
