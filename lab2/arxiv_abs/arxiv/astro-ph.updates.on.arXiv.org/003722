We show how magnetic observations of the Sun can be used in conjunction with an axisymmetric flux-transport
solar dynamo model in order to estimate the large-scale meridional circulation throughout the
convection zone. Our innovative approach rests on variational data assimilation, whereby the
distance between predictions and observations (measured by an objective function) is iteratively
minimized by means of an optimization algorithm seeking the meridional flow which best accounts
for the data. The minimization is performed using a quasi-Newton technique, which requires the
knowledge of the sensitivity of the objective function to the meridional flow. That sensitivity
is efficiently computed via the integration of the adjoint flux-transport dynamo model. Closed-loop
(also known as twin) experiments using synthetic data demonstrate the validity and accuracy of
this technique, for a variety of meridional flow configurations, ranging from unicellular and
equatorially symmetric to multicellular and equatorially asymmetric. In this well-controlled
synthetic context, we perform a systematic study of the behavior of our variational approach under
different observational configurations, by varying their spatial density, temporal density,
noise level, as well as the width of the assimilation window. We find that the method is remarkably
robust, leading in most cases to a recovery of the true meridional flow to within better than 1%. These
encouraging results are a first step towards using this technique to i) better constrain the physical
processes occurring inside the Sun and ii) better predict solar activity on decadal time scales.
