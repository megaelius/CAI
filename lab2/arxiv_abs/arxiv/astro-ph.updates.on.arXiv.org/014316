Provided a random realization of the cosmological model, observations of our cosmic neighborhood
now allow us to build simulations of the latter down to the non-linear threshold. The resulting local
Universe models are thus accurate up to a given residual cosmic variance. Namely some regions and
scales are apparently not constrained by the data and seem purely random. Drawing conclusions together
with their uncertainties involves then statistics implying a considerable amount of computing
time. By applying the constraining algorithm to paired fixed fields, this paper diverts the original
techniques from their first use to efficiently disentangle and estimate uncertainties on local
Universe simulations obtained with random fields. Paired fixed fields differ from random realizations
in the sense that their Fourier mode amplitudes are fixed and they are exactly out of phase. Constrained
paired fixed fields show that only 20% of the power spectrum on large scales (> tens of megaparsecs)
is purely random. Namely 80% of it is partly constrained by the large scale / small scale data correlations.
Additionally, two realizations of our local environment obtained with paired fixed fields of the
same pair constitute an excellent non-biased average or quasi-linear realization of the latter,
namely the equivalent of hundreds of constrained simulations. The variance between these two realizations
gives the uncertainty on the achievable local Universe simulations. These two simulations will
permit enhancing faster our local cosmic web understanding thanks to a drastically reduced required
computational time to appreciate its modeling limits and uncertainties.
