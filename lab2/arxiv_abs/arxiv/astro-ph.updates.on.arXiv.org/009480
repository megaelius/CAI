Slow-mode shocks are important in understanding fast magnetic reconnection, jet formation and
heating in the solar atmosphere, and other astrophysical systems. The atmospheric conditions
in the solar chromosphere allow both ionised and neutral particles to exist and interact. Under
such conditions, fine substructures exist within slow-mode shocks due to the decoupling and recoupling
of the plasma and neutral species. We study numerically the fine substructure within slow-mode
shocks in a partially ionised plasma, in particular, analysing the formation of an intermediate
transition within the slow-mode shock. High-resolution 1D numerical simulations are performed
using the (P\underline{I}P) code using a two-fluid approach. We discover that long-lived intermediate
(Alfven) shocks can form within the slow-mode shock, where there is a shock transition from above
to below the Alfven speed and a reversal of the magnetic field across the shock front. The collisional
coupling provides frictional heating to the neutral fluid, resulting in a Sedov-Taylor-like expansion
with overshoots in the neutral velocity and neutral density. The increase in density results in
a decrease of the Alfven speed and with this the plasma inflow is accelerated to above the Alfven speed
within the finite width of the shock leading to the intermediate transition. This process occurs
for a wide range of physical parameters and an intermediate shock is present for all investigated
values of plasma-$\beta$, neutral fraction, and magnetic angle. As time advances the magnitude
of the magnetic field reversal decreases since the neutral pressure cannot balance the Lorentz
force. The intermediate shock is long-lived enough to be considered a physical structure, independent
of the initial conditions.
