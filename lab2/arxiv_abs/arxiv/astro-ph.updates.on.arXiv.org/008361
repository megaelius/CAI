Aims. Moreno-Insertis et al. (2018) recently discovered two types of flux emergence in their numerical
simulations: magnetic loops and magnetic sheet emergence. Whereas magnetic loop emergence has
been documented well in the last years, by utilising high-resolution full Stokes data from ground-based
telescopes as well as satellites, magnetic sheet emergence is still an understudied process. We
report here on the first clear observational evidence of a magnetic sheet emergence and characterise
its development. Methods. Full Stokes spectra from the Hinode spectropolarimeter were inverted
with the SIR code to obtain solar atmospheric parameters such as temperature, line-of-sight velocities
and full magnetic field vector information. Results. We analyse a magnetic flux emergence event
observed in the quiet-sun internetwork. After a large scale appearance of linear polarisation,
a magnetic sheet with horizontal magnetic flux density of up to 194 Mx/cm$^{2}$ hovers in the low
photosphere spanning a region of 2 to 3 arcsec. The magnetic field azimuth obtained through Stokes
inversions clearly shows an organised structure of transversal magnetic flux density emerging.
The granule below the magnetic flux-sheet tears the structure apart leaving the emerged flux to
form several magnetic loops at the edges of the granule. Conclusions. A large amount of flux with
strong horizontal magnetic fields surfaces through the interplay of buried magnetic flux and convective
motions. The magnetic flux emerges within 10 minutes and we find a longitudinal magnetic flux at
the foot points of the order of $\sim$$10^{18}$ Mx. This is one to two orders of magnitude larger than
what has been reported for small-scale magnetic loops. The convective flows feed the newly emerged
flux into the pre-existing magnetic population on a granular scale.
