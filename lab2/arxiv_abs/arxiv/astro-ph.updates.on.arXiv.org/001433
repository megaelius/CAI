We investigated the optical lightcurve of T Pyx during its 2011 outburst by compiling a database
of SMEI and AAVSO observations. The SMEI lightcurve, providing unprecedented detail covering
1.5-49d post-discovery, was divided into four phases based on the idealised CN optical lightcurve;
the initial rise (1.5-3.3d), the pre-maximum halt (3.3-13.3d), the final rise (14.7-27.9d), and
the early decline (27.9d-). The SMEI lightcurve contains a strongly detected period of 1.44+/-0.05d
during the pre-maximum phase. These oscillations resemble those found in TNR models arising from
instabilities in the expanding envelope. No spectral variation mirroring the lightcurve periodicity
was found. A marked dip at 22-24d just before maximum light (27.9d) may represent the same phenomenon
seen in novae observed by SMEI. Spectra from the Liverpool Telescope and SMARTS 1.5m were obtained
from 0.8-80.7 and 155.1-249.9d, covering the major phases of development. A distinct high velocity
ejection phase was evident during the early rise (V~4000 km/s). A marked drop at 5.7d, and then a gradual
increase occurred in the ejection velocity which stabilised at ~1500 km/s at the pre-maximum halt.
Here we propose two stages of mass loss, a short-lived phase occurring immediately after outburst,
lasting ~6d, followed by a steadily evolving and higher mass loss phase. The overall spectral development
follows that typical of a CN and comparison with the photometric behaviour reveals consistencies
with the evolving pseudo-photosphere model of a CN outburst. Comparing optical spectra to X-ray
and radio lightcurves, weak [Fe X] 6375 Angstrom emission was marginally detected before the X-ray
rise and was clearly present during the brightest phase of X-ray emission. If the onset of the X-ray
phase and the start of the optical final decline are related to the cessation of significant mass
loss, then this occurred at 90-110d.
