Using known frequencies of the twin-peak high-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations (HF QPOs)
and known mass of the central black hole, the black-hole dimensionless spin can be determined by
assuming a concrete version of the resonance model. However, a wide range of observationally limited
values of the black hole mass implies low precision of the spin estimates. We discuss the possibility
of higher precision of the black hole spin measurements in the framework of a multi-resonance model
inspired by observations of more than two HF QPOs in the black hole systems, which are expected to
occur at two (or more) different radii of the accretion disc. For the black hole systems we focus on
the special case of duplex frequencies, when the top, bottom, or mixed frequency is common at two
different radii where the resonances occur giving triple frequency sets. The sets of triple frequency
ratios and the related spin are given. The strong resonance model for "magic" values of the black
hole spin means that two (or more) versions of resonance could occur at the same radius, allowing
cooperative effects between the resonances. For neutron star systems we introduce a resonant switch
model that assumes switching of oscillatory modes at resonant points. In the case of doubled twin-peak
HF QPOs excited at two different radii with common top, bottom, or mixed frequency, the black hole
spin is given by the triple frequency ratio set. The spin is determined precisely, but not uniquely,
because the same frequency set could correspond to more than one concrete spin. The black hole mass
is given by the magnitude of the observed frequencies. The resonant switch model puts relevant limits
on the mass and spin of neutron stars, and we expect a strong increase in the fitting procedure precision
when different twin oscillatory modes are applied to data in the vicinity of different resonant
points.
