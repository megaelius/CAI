Aims: Investigate how the strength of episodic accretion bursts depends on eccentricity. Methods:
We investigate the binary trigger hypothesis in longer-period (>20yr) binaries by carrying out
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of the formation of low-mass binary
stars down to final separations of ~10AU, including the effects of gas turbulence and magnetic fields.
We run two simulations with an initial turbulent gas core of one solar mass each and two different
initial turbulent Mach numbers, M = 0.1 and 0.2, for 6500yr after protostar formation. Results:
We observe bursts of accretion at periastron during the early stages when the eccentricity of the
binary system is still high. We find that this correlation between bursts of accretion and passing
periastron breaks down at later stages, because of the gradual circularisation of the orbits. For
eccentricities greater than e=0.2, we observe episodic accretion triggered near periastron.
However, we do not find any strong correlation between the strength (the ratio of the burst accretion
ratio to the quiescent accretion rate) of episodic accretion and eccentricity. We determine that
accretion events are likely triggered by torques between the rotation of the circumstellar disc
and the approaching binary stars. We compare our results with observational data of episodic accretion
in short-period binaries and find good agreement between our simulations and the observations.
Conclusions: We conclude that episodic accretion is a universal mechanism operating in eccentric
young binary-star systems, independent of separation, and should be observable in long-period
binaries as well as in short-period binaries, but that the strength will depend on the torques, and
hence the separation at periastron.
