The results of Suzaku observations of the outskirts of Abell 3395 including a large-scale structure
filament toward Abell 3391 are presented. We measured temperature and abundance distributions
from the southern outskirt of Abell 3395 to the north at the virial radius, where a filament structure
has been found in the former X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect observations between Abell 3391
and 3395. The overall temperature structure is consistent with the universal profile proposed
by Okabe et al.(2014) for relaxed clusters except for the filament region. A hint of the ICM heating
is found between the two clusters, which might be due to the interaction of them in the early phase
of a cluster merger. Although we obtained relatively low metal abundance of $Z=0.169^{+0.164+0.009+0.018
}_{-0.150-0.004-0.015 }$ solar, where the first, second, and third errors are statistical, cosmic
X-ray background systematic, and non X-ray background systematic, respectively, at the virial
radius in the filament, our results are still consistent with the former results of other clusters
($Z \sim 0.3$ solar) within errors. Therefore, our results are also consistent with the early enrichment
scenario. We estimated Compton $y$ parameters only from X-ray results in the region between Abell
3391 and 3395 assuming a simple geometry. They are smaller than the previous SZ results with Planck
satellite. The difference could be attributed to a more elaborate geometry such as a filament inclined
to the line-of-sight direction, or underestimation of the X-ray temperature because of the unresolved
multi-temperature structures or undetected hot X-ray emission of the shock heated gas.
