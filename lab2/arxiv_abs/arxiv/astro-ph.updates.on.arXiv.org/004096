Since the advent of the space-based photometric missions such as CoRoT and NASA's Kepler, asteroseismology
has acquired a central role in our understanding about stellar physics. The Kepler spacecraft,
especially, is still releasing excellent photometric observations that contain a large amount
of information not yet investigated. For exploiting the full potential of these data, sophisticated
and robust analysis tools are now essential, so that further constraining of stellar structure
and evolutionary models can be obtained. In addition, extracting detailed asteroseismic properties
for many stars can yield new insights on their correlations to fundamental stellar properties and
dynamics. After a brief introduction to the Bayesian notion of probability, I describe the code
DIAMONDS for Bayesian parameter estimation and model comparison by means of the nested sampling
Monte Carlo (NSMC) algorithm. NSMC constitutes an efficient and powerful method, in replacement
to standard Markov chain Monte Carlo, very suitable for high-dimensional and multimodal problems
that are typical of detailed asteroseismic analyses, such as the fitting and mode identification
of individual oscillation modes in stars (known as peak-bagging). DIAMONDS is able to provide robust
results for statistical inferences involving tens of individual oscillation modes, while at the
same time preserving a considerable computational efficiency for identifying the solution. In
the tutorial, I will present the fitting of the stellar background signal and the peak-bagging analysis
of the oscillation modes in a red-giant star, providing an example to use Bayesian evidence for assessing
the peak significance of the fitted oscillation peaks.
