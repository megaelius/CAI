The strong, nearly wavelength-independent absorption cross section of aerosols produces featureless
exoplanet transmission spectra, limiting our ability to characterize their atmospheres. Here
we show that even in the presence of featureless spectra, we can still characterize certain atmospheric
properties. Specifically, we constrain the upper and lower pressure boundaries of aerosol layers,
and present plausible composition candidates. We study the case of the bloated Saturn-mass planet
WASP-49b, where near-infrared observations reveal a flat transmission spectrum between 0.7 and
1.0 {\microns}. First, we use a hydrodynamic upper-atmosphere code to estimate the pressure reached
by the ionizing stellar high-energy photons at $10^{-8}$ bar, setting the upper pressure boundary
where aerosols could exist. Then, we combine HELIOS and Pyrat Bay radiative-transfer models to
constrain the temperature and photospheric pressure of atmospheric aerosols, in a Bayesian framework.
For WASP-49b, we constrain the transmission photosphere (hence, the aerosol deck boundaries)
to pressures above $10^{-5}$ bar (100$\times$ solar metallicity), $10^{-4}$ bar (solar), and
$10^{-3}$ bar (0.1$\times$ solar) as lower boundary, and below $10^{-7}$ bar as upper boundary.
Lastly, we compare condensation curves of aerosol compounds with the planet's pressure-temperature
profile to identify plausible condensates responsible for the absorption. Under these circumstances,
we find as candidates: Na$_{2}$S (at 100$\times$ solar metallicity); Cr and MnS (at solar and 0.1$\times$
solar); and forsterite, enstatite, and alabandite (at 0.1$\times$ solar).
