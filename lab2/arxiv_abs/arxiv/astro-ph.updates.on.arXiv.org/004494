The Fermi Collaboration has recently updated their analysis of gamma rays from the center of the
Galaxy. They reconfirm the presence of an unexplained emission feature which is most prominent
in the region of $1-10$ GeV, known as the Galactic Center GeV excess (GCE). Although the GCE is now
firmly detected, an interpretation of this emission as a signal of self-annihilating dark matter
(DM) particles is not unambiguously possible due to systematic effects in the gamma-ray modeling
estimated in the Galactic Plane. In this paper we build a covariance matrix, collecting different
systematic uncertainties investigated in the Fermi Collaboration's paper that affect the GCE
spectrum. We show that models where part of the GCE is due to annihilating DM can still be consistent
with the new data. We also re-evaluate the parameter space regions of the minimal supersymmetric
Standard Model (MSSM) that can contribute dominantly to the GCE via neutralino DM annihilation.
All recent constraints from DM direct detection experiments such as PICO, LUX, PandaX and Xenon1T,
limits on the annihilation cross section from dwarf spheroidal galaxies and Large Hadron Collider
limits are considered in this analysis. Due to a slight shift in the energy spectrum of the GC excess
with respect to the previous Fermi analysis, and the recent limits from direct detection experiments,
we find a slightly shifted parameter region of the MSSM compared to our previous analysis that is
consistent with the GCE. Neutralinos with a mass between $85-220$ GeV can describe the excess via
annihilation into a pair of $W$-bosons or top quarks. Remarkably, there are low fine-tuning models
among the regions that we have found. The complete set of solutions will be probed by upcoming direct
detection experiments and with dedicated searches in the upcoming data of the Large Hadron Collider.
