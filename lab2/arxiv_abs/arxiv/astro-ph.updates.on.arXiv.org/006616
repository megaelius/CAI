We present 353 GHz full-sky maps of the polarization fraction $p$, angle $\psi$, and dispersion
of angles $S$ of Galactic dust thermal emission produced from the 2018 release of Planck data. We
confirm that the mean and maximum of $p$ decrease with increasing $N_H$. The uncertainty on the maximum
polarization fraction, $p_\mathrm{max}=22.0$% at 80 arcmin resolution, is dominated by the uncertainty
on the zero level in total intensity. The observed inverse behaviour between $p$ and $S$ is interpreted
with models of the polarized sky that include effects from only the topology of the turbulent Galactic
magnetic field. Thus, the statistical properties of $p$, $\psi$, and $S$ mostly reflect the structure
of the magnetic field. Nevertheless, we search for potential signatures of varying grain alignment
and dust properties. First, we analyse the product map $S \times p$, looking for residual trends.
While $p$ decreases by a factor of 3--4 between $N_H=10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $N_H=2\times 10^{22}$
cm$^{-2}$, $S \times p$ decreases by only about 25%, a systematic trend observed in both the diffuse
ISM and molecular clouds. Second, we find no systematic trend of $S \times p$ with the dust temperature,
even though in the diffuse ISM lines of sight with high $p$ and low $S$ tend to have colder dust. We also
compare Planck data with starlight polarization in the visible at high latitudes. The agreement
in polarization angles is remarkable. Two polarization emission-to-extinction ratios that characterize
dust optical properties depend only weakly on $N_H$ and converge towards the values previously
determined for translucent lines of sight. We determine an upper limit for the polarization fraction
in extinction of 13%, compatible with the $p_\mathrm{max}$ observed in emission. These results
provide strong constraints for models of Galactic dust in diffuse gas.
