In the last few years, machine learning techniques, in particular convolutional neural networks,
have been investigated as a method to replace or complement traditional matched filtering techniques
that are used to detect the gravitational-wave signature of merging black holes. However, to date,
these methods have not yet been successfully applied to the analysis of long stretches of data recorded
by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave observatories. In this work, we critically examine
the use of convolutional neural networks as a tool to search for merging black holes. We identify
the strengths and limitations of this approach, highlight some common pitfalls in translating
between machine learning and gravitational-wave astronomy, and discuss the interdisciplinary
challenges. In particular, we explain in detail why convolutional neural networks alone cannot
be used to claim a statistically significant gravitational-wave detection. However, we demonstrate
how they can still be used to rapidly flag the times of potential signals in the data for a more detailed
follow-up. Our convolutional neural network architecture as well as the proposed performance
metrics are better suited for this task than a standard binary classifications scheme. A detailed
evaluation of our approach on Advanced LIGO data demonstrates the potential of such systems as trigger
generators. Finally, we sound a note of caution by constructing adversarial examples, which showcase
interesting "failure modes" of our model, where inputs with no visible resemblance to real gravitational-wave
signals are identified as such by the network with high confidence.
