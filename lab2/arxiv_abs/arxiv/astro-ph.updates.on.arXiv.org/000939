The cosmic abundance of hydrides depends critically on high-energy UV, X-ray, and particle irradiation.
Here we study hydrides in star-forming regions where irradiation by the young stellar object can
be substantial, and density and temperature can be much enhanced over interstellar values. Lines
of OH, CH, NH, SH and their ions OH+, CH+, NH+, SH+, H2O+, and H3O+ were observed in star-forming regions
by the HIFI spectrometer onboard the Herschel Space Observatory. Molecular column densities are
derived from observed ground-state lines, models, or rotational diagrams. We report here on two
prototypical high-mass regions, AFGL 2591 and W3 IRS5, and compare them to chemical calculations
making assumptions on the high-energy irradiation. A model assuming no ionizing protostellar
emission is compared with (i) a model assuming strong protostellar X-ray emission and (ii) a two-dimensional
(2D) model including emission in the far UV (FUV, 6 -- 13.6 eV) irradiating the outflow walls that
separate the outflowing gas and infalling envelope material. We confirm that the effect of FUV in
two dimensional models with enlarged irradiated surfaces is clearly noticeable. A molecule that
is very sensitive to FUV irradiation is CH+, enhanced in abundance by more than 5 orders of magnitude.
The HIFI observations of CH+ lines agree with the two-dimensional FUV model by Bruderer et al. which
computes abundances, non-LTE excitation and line radiative transfer.{Ref 20} It is concluded
that CH+ is a good FUV tracer in star-forming regions. The effect of potential X-ray irradiation
is not excluded, but cannot be demonstrated by the present data.
