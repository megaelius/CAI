The formaldehyde $\rm H_2CO(1_{10} - 1_{11})$ absorption line and H$110\alpha$ radio recombination
line (RRL) have been observed toward the Aquila Molecular Cloud using the Nanshan 25 m telescope
operated by the Xinjiang Astronomical Observatory CAS. These first observations of the $\rm H_2CO$
$(1_{10} - 1_{11})$ absorption line determine the extent of the molecular regions that are affected
by the ongoing star formation in the Aquila molecular complex and show some of the dynamic properties.
The distribution of the excitation temperature $T_{ex}$ for $\rm H_2CO$ identifies the two known
star formation regions W40 and Serpens South as well as a smaller new region Serpens 3. The intensity
and velocity distributions of $\rm H_2CO$ and $\rm ^{13}CO(1-0)$ do not agree well with each other,
which confirms that the $\rm H_2CO$ absorption structure is mostly determined by the excitation
of the molecules resulting from the star formation rather than by the availability of molecular
material as represented by the distribution. Some velocity-coherent linear $\rm ^{13}CO(1-0)$
structures have been identified in velocity channel maps of $\rm H_2CO$ and it is found that the three
star formation regions lie on the intersect points of filaments. The $\rm H110\alpha$ emission
is found only at the location of the W40 H II region and spectral profile indicates a redshifted spherical
outflow structure in the outskirts of the H II region. Sensitive mapping of $\rm H_2CO$ absorption
of the Aquila Complex has correctly identified the locations of star-formation activity in complex
molecular clouds and the spectral profiles reveal the dominant velocity components and may identify
the presence of outflows.
