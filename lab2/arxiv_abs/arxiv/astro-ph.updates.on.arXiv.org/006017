Observations of the spin distribution of rapidly rotating neutron stars show evidence for a lack
of stars spinning at frequencies larger than $f\approx 700$ Hz, well below the predictions of theoretical
equations of state. This has generally been taken as evidence of an additional spin-down torque
operating in these systems and it has been suggested that gravitational wave torques may be operating
and be linked to a potentially observable signal. In this paper we aim to determine whether additional
spin-down torques are necessary, or whether the observed limit of $f\approx 700$ Hz could correspond
to the mass-shedding frequency for the observed systems and is simply a consequence of the, currently
unknown, state of matter at high densities. Given our ignorance with regard to the true equation
of state of matter above nuclear saturation densities, we make minimal physical assumption and
only demand causality in the core. We then connect our causally-limited equation of state to a realistic
microphysical crustal equation of state for densities below nuclear saturation density. This
produces a limiting model that will give the lowest possible maximum frequency, which we compare
to observational constraints on neutron star masses and frequencies. We also compare our findings
with the constraints on the tidal deformability obtained in the observations of the GW170817 event.
We find that the lack of pulsars spinning faster than $f\approx 700$ Hz is not compatible with our
causal limited `minimal' equation of state, for which the breakup frequency cannot be lower than
$f_{\rm max}\approx 1200$ Hz. A low frequency cutoff, around $f\approx 800$ Hz could only be possible
if we assume that these systems do not contain neutron stars with masses above $M\approx 2 M_\odot$.
This would have to be due either to selection effects, or possibly to a phase transition in the interior
of the neutron star.
