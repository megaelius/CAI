A new era in radioastronomy will begin with the upcoming large-scale surveys planned at the Australian
Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). ASKAP started its Early Science program in October
2017 and several target fields were observed during the array commissioning phase. The SCORPIO
field was the first observed in the Galactic Plane in Band 1 (792-1032 MHz) using 15 commissioned
antennas. The achieved sensitivity and large field of view already allow to discover new sources
and survey thousands of existing ones with improved precision with respect to previous surveys.
Data analysis is currently ongoing to deliver the first source catalogue. Given the increased scale
of the data, source extraction and characterization, even in this Early Science phase, have to be
carried out in a mostly automated way. This process presents significant challenges due to the presence
of extended objects and diffuse emission close to the Galactic Plane. In this context we have extended
and optimized a novel source finding tool, named CAESAR , to allow extraction of both compact and
extended sources from radio maps. A number of developments have been done driven by the analysis
of the SCORPIO map and in view of the future ASKAP Galactic Plane survey. The main goals are the improvement
of algorithm performances and scalability as well as of software maintainability and usability
within the radio community. In this paper we present the current status of CAESAR and report a first
systematic characterization of its performance for both compact and extended sources using simulated
maps. Future prospects are discussed in light of the obtained results.
