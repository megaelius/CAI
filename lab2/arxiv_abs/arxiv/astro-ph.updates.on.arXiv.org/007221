Gravitational-wave standard sirens present a novel approach for the determination of the Hubble
constant. After the recent spectacular confirmation of the method thanks to GW170817 and its optical
counterpart, additional standard siren measurements from future gravitational-wave sources
are expected to constrain the Hubble constant to high accuracy. At the same time, improved constraints
are expected from observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization and from baryon
acoustic oscillations (BAO) surveys. We explore the role of future standard siren constraints
on $H_0$ in light of expected CMB+BAO data. Considering a $10$-parameters cosmological model,
in which curvature, the dark energy equation of state, and the Hubble constant are unbounded by CMB
observations, we find that a combination of future CMB+BAO data will constrain the Hubble parameter
to $\sim 1.5 \%$. Further extending the parameter space to a time-varying dark energy equation of
state, we find that future CMB+BAO constraints on $H_0$ are relaxed to $\sim 3.0 \%$. These accuracies
are within reach of future standard siren measurements from the Hanford-Livingston-Virgo and
the Hanford-Livingston-Virgo-Japan-India networks of interferometers, showing the cosmological
relevance of these sources. If future gravitational-wave standard siren measurements reach $1\%$
on $H_0$, as expected, they would significantly improve future CMB+BAO constraints on curvature
and on the dark energy equation of state by up to a factor $\sim 3$. We also show that the inclusion of
$H_0$ constraints from gravitational-wave standard sirens could result in a reduction of the dark
energy figure-of-merit (i.e., the cosmological parameter volume) by up to a factor of $\sim 400$.
