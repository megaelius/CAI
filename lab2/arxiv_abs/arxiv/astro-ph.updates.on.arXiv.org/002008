The detection and characterisation of extra-solar planets is a major theme driving modern astronomy,
with the vast majority of such measurements being achieved by Doppler radial-velocity and transit
observations. Another technique -- direct imaging -- can access a parameter space that complements
these methods, and paves the way for future technologies capable of detailed characterization
of exoplanetary atmospheres and surfaces. However achieving the required levels of performance
with direct imaging, particularly from ground-based telescopes which must contend with the Earth's
turbulent atmosphere, requires considerable sophistication in the instrument and detection
strategy. Here we demonstrate a new generation of photonic pupil-remapping devices which build
upon the interferometric framework developed for the {\it Dragonfly} instrument: a high contrast
waveguide-based device which recovers robust complex visibility observables. New generation
Dragonfly devices overcome problems caused by interference from unguided light and low throughput,
promising unprecedented on-sky performance. Closure phase measurement scatter of only $\sim
0.2^\circ$ has been achieved, with waveguide throughputs of $> 70\%$. This translates to a maximum
contrast-ratio sensitivity (between the host star and its orbiting planet) at $1 \lambda/D$ (1$\sigma$
detection) of $5.3 \times 10^{-4}$ (when a conventional adaptive-optics (AO) system is used) or
$1.8 \times 10^{-4}$ (for typical `extreme-AO' performance), improving even further when random
error is minimised by averaging over multiple exposures. This is an order of magnitude beyond conventional
pupil-segmenting interferometry techniques (such as aperture masking), allowing a previously
inaccessible part of the star to planet contrast-separation parameter space to be explored.
