We add a suite of chemical abundances to the MACER (Massive AGN Controlled Ellipticals Resolved)
2D code, by solving 12 additional continuity equations for H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Fe and Ni
respectively with sources from AGB stars and supernovae of type Ia and II with metal yields based
on standard stellar physics. New stars, formed in Toomre unstable circumnuclear disks (of a size
$\lesssim150$ parsec), are assumed to have a top-heavy initial mass function with a power index
of 1.65. The metal dilution effects due to cosmic accretion are also included. With the high resolution
of few parsecs in central regions, resolved black hole accretion and AGN feedback, we can track the
metal enrichment, transportation and dilution throughout the modeled galaxies. We model a massive
elliptical galaxy with velocity dispersion $\sim280$ km/s, retrieve the chemical composition
of the BAL winds launched by the central AGN, and also synthesize the X-ray features of the hot ISM,
e.g. the iron abundance seen in thermal X-ray. We find that (1) the simulated metallicity in the BAL
winds could be up to $\sim 8 Z_\odot$, while that of the hot ISM in the host galaxies is $\sim 2.3 Z_\odot$,
matching well with SDSS observations of BLR gas; (2) the X-ray emitting hot gas is metal enriched
with a typical value $\sim2.5 Z_\odot$; (3) the circumunuclear cold gas disk, where the metals are
condensed, further enriched and recycled, plays a critical role in the chemical evolution of its
host galaxy; (4) the black hole accretion rate $\dot{M}_{\rm BH}$ linearly correlates with the
star formation rate $\dot{M}_\star^+$ in the circumnuclear disk, i.e, $\dot{M}_\star^+ \sim
7.7 \dot{M}_{\rm BH}$, but lagged in time by roughly $10^6$ years. The radiative features of the
BAL winds are also discussed in this paper, which are testable by direct observations.
