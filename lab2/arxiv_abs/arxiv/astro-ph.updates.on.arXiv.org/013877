We derive the plage area evolution over the last 12 solar cycles employing data from all Ca II K archives
available publicly in digital form known to us, including several as yet unexplored Ca II K archives.
We analyse more than 290,000 full-disc Ca II K observations from 43 datasets spanning the period
1892-2019. All images were consistently processed with an automatic procedure that performs the
photometric calibration (if needed) and the limb-darkening compensation. The processing also
accounts for artefacts plaguing many of the images, including some very specific artefacts such
as bright arcs found in Kyoto and Yerkes data. We have produced a plage area time-series from each
analysed dataset. We found that the differences between the plage areas derived from individual
archives are mainly due to the differences in the central wavelength and the bandpass used to acquire
the data at the various sites. We have empirically cross-calibrated and combined the results obtained
from each dataset to produce a composite series of plage areas. "Backbone" series are used to bridge
all the series together. We have also shown that the selection of the backbone series has little effect
on the final plage area composite. We have quantified the uncertainty of determining the plage areas
with our processing due to shifts in the central wavelength and found it to be less than 0.01 in fraction
of the solar disc for the average conditions found on historical data. We also found the variable
seeing conditions during the observations to slightly increase the plage areas during activity
maxima. We provide the so far most complete time series of plage areas based on corrected and calibrated
historical and modern Ca II K images. Consistent plage areas are now available on 88% of all days from
1892 onwards and on 98% from 1907 onwards.
