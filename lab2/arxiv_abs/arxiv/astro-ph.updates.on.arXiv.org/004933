The use of instruments that record narrow band images at selected wavelengths is a common approach
in solar observations. They allow the scanning of a spectral line by sampling the Stokes profiles
with 2D images at each line position, but require a compromise between spectral resolution and temporal
cadence. We evaluate the impact of the time-dependent acquisition of different wavelengths on
the inversion of spectropolarimetric profiles from chromospheric lines during umbral flashes.
Simulations of non-linear wave propagation in a sunspot were performed with the code MANCHA. Synthetic
Stokes parameters in the Ca II 8542 A line in NLTE were computed for an umbral flash using the code NICOLE.
Artificial profiles with the same wavelength coverage and temporal cadence from reported observations
were constructed and inverted. The inferred atmospheric stratifications were compared with the
original models. The inferred atmospheres provide a reasonable characterization of the thermodynamic
properties of the atmosphere during most of the phases of the umbral flash. Only at the early stages
of the flash, when the shock wave reaches the formation height of the line, the Stokes profiles present
apparent wavelength shifts and other spurious deformations. These features are misinterpreted
by the inversion code, which can return unrealistic atmospheric models from a good fit of the Stokes
profiles. The misguided results include flashed atmospheres with strong downflows, even though
the simulation exhibits upflows during the umbral flash, and large variations in the magnetic field
strength. Our analyses validate the inversion of Stokes profiles acquired by sequentially scanning
certain selected wavelengths of a line profile, even in the case of rapidly-changing events such
as umbral flashes. However, the inversions are unreliable during a short period at the development
phase of the flash.
