We use more than a decade of radial velocity measurements for $\alpha$ Cen A, B, and Proxima Centauri
from HARPS, CHIRON, and UVES to identify the $M \sin i$ and orbital periods of planets that could have
been detected if they existed. At each point in a mass-period grid, we sample a simulated, Keplerian
signal with the precision and cadence of existing data and assess the probability that the signal
could have been produced by noise alone. Existing data places detection thresholds in the classically
defined habitable zones at about $M \sin i$ of 53 M$_{\oplus}$ for $\alpha$ Cen A, 8.4 M$_{\oplus}$
for $\alpha$ Cen B, and 0.47 M$_{\oplus}$ for Proxima Centauri. Additionally, we examine the impact
of systematic errors, or "red noise" in the data. A comparison of white- and red-noise simulations
highlights quasi-periodic variability in the radial velocities that may be caused by systematic
errors, photospheric velocity signals, or planetary signals. For example, the red-noise simulations
show a peak above white-noise simulations at the period of Proxima Centauri b. We also carry out a
spectroscopic analysis of the chemical composition of the $\alpha$ Centauri stars. The stars have
super-solar metallicity with ratios of C/O and Mg/Si that are similar to the Sun, suggesting that
any small planets in the $\alpha$ Cen system may be compositionally similar to our terrestrial planets.
Although the small projected separation of $\alpha$ Cen A and B currently hampers extreme-precision
radial velocity measurements, the angular separation is now increasing. By 2019, $\alpha$ Cen
A and B will be ideal targets for renewed Doppler planet surveys.
