Recent observations with ALMA have revealed evidence for non-thermal synchrotron emission from
the core regions of two nearby Seyfert galaxies. This suggests that the coronae of accretion disks
in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be conducive to the acceleration of non-thermal electrons,
in addition to the hot, thermal electrons responsible for their X-ray emission through thermal
Comptonization. Here we investigate the mechanism of such particle acceleration, based on observationally
inferred parameters for AGN disk coronae. One possibility to account for the observed non-thermal
electrons is diffusive shock acceleration, as long as the acceleration timescale does not exceed
$\sim10^6$ times the particle gyration time. These non-thermal electrons can generate gamma-rays
via inverse Compton scattering of disk photons, which can appear with power-law spectra in the MeV
band, while those with energies above $\sim100$ MeV would be attenuated via internal $\gamma\gamma$
pair production. The integrated emission from all AGNs with such thermal and non-thermal Comptonization
can reproduce the observed cosmic background radiation in X-rays as well as gamma-rays up to $\sim
10$ MeV. Furthermore, protons accelerated in the same conditions can induce the production of high-energy
neutrinos, which may contribute to the diffuse neutrino background observed by IceCube. We find
that our observationally motivated models are able to account for the diffuse neutrino flux at energies
below 100-300 TeV, but face difficulties at higher energies. The next generation of MeV gamma-ray
and neutrino facilities can test these expectations by searching for signals from bright, nearby
Seyfert galaxies such as NGC 4151 and IC 4329A.
