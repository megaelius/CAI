We investigate electron temperature (Te) and gas-phase oxygen abundance (Z_Te) measurements
for galaxies in the local Universe (z < 0.25). Our sample comprises spectra from a total of 264 emission-line
systems, ranging from individual HII regions to whole galaxies, including 23 composite HII regions
from "star-forming main sequence" galaxies in the MaNGA survey. We utilise 130 of these systems
with directly measurable Te(OII) to calibrate a new metallicity-dependent Te(OIII) - Te(OII)
relation that provides a better representation of our varied dataset than existing relations from
the literature. We also provide an alternative Te(OIII) - Te(NII) calibration. This new Te method
is then used to obtain accurate Z_Te estimates and form the mass - metallicity relation (MZR) for
a sample of 118 local galaxies. We find that all the Te(OIII) - Te(OII) relations considered here
systematically under-estimate Z_Te for low-ionisation systems by up to 0.6 dex. We determine that
this is due to such systems having an intrinsically higher O+ abundance than O++ abundance, rendering
Z_Te estimates based only on [OIII] lines inaccurate. We therefore provide an empirical correction
based on strong emission lines to account for this bias when using our new Te(OIII) - Te(OII) and Te(OIII)
- Te(NII) relations. This allows for accurate metallicities (1sigma = 0.08 dex) to be derived for
any low-redshift system with an [OIII]4363 detection, regardless of its physical size or ionisation
state. The MZR formed from our dataset is in very good agreement with those formed from direct measurements
of metal recombination lines and blue supergiant absorption lines, in contrast to most other Te-based
and strong-line-based MZRs. Our new Te method therefore provides an accurate and precise way of
obtaining Z_Te for a large and diverse range of star-forming systems in the local Universe.
