Preliminary processing results are presented for a dataset obtained with the Solar Optical Telescope
on the Hinode satellite. The idea of the project is to record, nearly simultaneously, the full velocity
and magnetic-field vectors in growing active regions and sunspot groups at a photospheric level
and distinguish between the manifestations of two mechanisms of sunspot-group formation --- the
rising of an flux tube of a strong magnetic field and the in situ amplification and structuring of
magnetic field by convection. A young bipolar subregion developing within AR 11313 was observed
on 9--10 October 2011. Filtergrams and Dopplergrams were obtained, and one or two spectropolarimetric
fast-mode scans were done. Based on the series of filtergrams, the trajectories of corks are computed,
using a technique similar to but more reliable than local correlation tracking, and compared with
the magnetic maps. Currently, only the vertical magnetic field and the horizontal flows are used
for a qualitative analysis. The velocity pattern in the growing active region under study has nothing
to do with a spreading flow on the scale of the entire bipolar region, which could be expected if a tube
of strong magnetic field emerged. Instead, normal mesogranular and supergranular flows are observed,
and separatrices between the magnetic polarities can be dentified, such that the surface flows
converge to but not diverge from these separatsix curves. The observed scenario of evolution seems
to agree with Bumba's inference that the development of an active region does not entail the destruction
of the existing convective-velocity field. The convective mechanism appears to be better compatible
with observations than the rising-tube mechanism. In the umbras of the well-developed sunspots,
flows converging to the umbra centres are revealed. Spreading streams are present around these
spots.
