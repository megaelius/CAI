We present an extensive peakbagging effort on Kepler data of $\sim$50 red giant stars in the open
star cluster NGC 6819. By employing sophisticated pre-processing of the time series and Markov
Chain Monte Carlo techniques we extracted individual frequencies, heights and linewidths for
hundreds of oscillation modes. We show that the "average" asteroseismic parameter $\delta\nu_{02}$,
derived from these, can be used to distinguish the stellar evolutionary state between the red giant
branch (RGB) stars and red clump (RC) stars. Masses and radii are estimated using asteroseismic
scaling relations, both empirically corrected to obtain self-consistency as well as agreement
with independent measures of distance, and using updated theoretical corrections. Remarkable
agreement is found, allowing the evolutionary state of the giants to be determined exclusively
from the empirical correction to the scaling relations. We find a mean mass of the RGB stars and RC
stars in NGC 6819 to be $1.61\pm0.02\,\textrm{M}_\odot$ and $1.64{\pm}0.02\,\textrm{M}_\odot$,
respectively. The difference $\Delta M=-0.03\pm0.01\,\textrm{M}_\odot$ is almost insensitive
to systematics, suggesting very little RGB mass loss, if any. Stars that are outliers relative to
the ensemble reveal overmassive members that likely evolved via mass-transfer in a blue straggler
phase. We suggest that KIC 4937011, a low-mass Li-rich giant, is a cluster member in the RC phase that
experienced very high mass-loss during its evolution. Such over- and undermassive stars need to
be considered when studying field giants, since the true age of such stars cannot be known and there
is currently no way to distinguish them from normal stars.
