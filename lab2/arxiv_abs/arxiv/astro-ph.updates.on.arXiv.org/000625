Aims: We study the fragmentation and dynamical properties of a massive starless gas clump at the
onset of high-mass star formation. Methods: Based on Herschel continuum data we identify a massive
gas clump that remains far-infrared dark up to 100mum wavelengths. The fragmentation and dynamical
properties are investigated by means of Plateau de Bure Interferometer and Nobeyama 45m single-dish
spectral line and continuum observations. Results: The massive gas reservoir fragments at spatial
scales of ~18000AU in four cores. Comparing the spatial extent of this high-mass region with intermediate-
to low-mass starless cores from the literature, we find that linear sizes do not vary significantly
over the whole mass regime. However, the high-mass regions squeeze much more gas into these similar
volumes and hence have orders of magnitude larger densities. The fragmentation properties of the
presented low-to high-mass regions are consistent with gravitational instable Jeans fragmentation.
Furthermore, we find multiple velocity components associated with the resolved cores. Recent
radiative transfer hydrodynamic simulations of the dynamic collapse of massive gas clumps also
result in multiple velocity components along the line of sight because of the clumpy structure of
the regions. This result is supported by a ratio between viral and total gas mass for the whole region
<1. Conclusions: This apparently still starless high-mass gas clump exhibits clear signatures
of early fragmentation and dynamic collapse prior to the formation of an embedded heating source.
A comparison with regions of lower mass reveals that the linear size of star-forming regions does
not necessarily have to vary much for different masses, however, the mass reservoirs and gas densities
are orders of magnitude enhanced for high-mass regions compared to their lower-mass siblings.
