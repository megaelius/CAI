Synchrotron radio halos at the center of merging galaxy clusters provide the most spectacular and
direct evidence of the presence of relativistic particles and magnetic fields associated with
the intracluster medium. The study of polarized emission from radio halos has been shown to be extremely
important to constrain the properties of intracluster magnetic fields. However, detecting this
polarized signal is a very hard task with the current radio facilities.We investigate whether future
radio observatories, such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and its precursors and pathfinders,
will be able to detect the polarized emission of radio halos in galaxy clusters.On the basis of cosmological
magnetohydrodynamical simulations with initial magnetic fields injected by active galactic
nuclei, we predict the expected radio halo polarized signal at 1.4 GHz. We compare these expectations
with the limits of current radio facilities and explore the potential of the forthcoming radio interferometers
to investigate intracluster magnetic fields through the detection of polarized emission from
radio halos.The resolution and sensitivity values that are expected to be obtained in future sky
surveys performed at 1.4 GHz using the SKA precursors and pathfinders (like APERTIF and ASKAP) are
very promising for the detection of the polarized emission of the most powerful (L1.4GHz>10e25
Watt/Hz) radio halos. Furthermore, the JVLA have the potential to already detect polarized emission
from strong radio halos, at a relatively low resolution.However, the possibility of detecting
the polarized signal in fainter radio halos (L1.4GHz~10e24 Watt/Hz) at high resolution requires
a sensitivity reachable only with SKA.
