The Planck satellite provides a set of all-sky maps spanning nine frequencies from 30 GHz to 857 GHz,
with an unprecedented combination of sensitivity and angular resolution. Planets, minor bodies,
and diffuse interplanetary dust (IPD) contribute to the submillimetre and millimetre sky emission
it observed. The diffuse emission can be effectively separated from Galactic and other emissions,
because Planck views a given point on the distant celestial sphere multiple times, through different
columns of IPD. We use the Planck data to investigate the behaviour of Zodiacal emission over the
whole sky in the sub-millimetre and millimetre. We fit the COBE Zodiacal model to the Planck data
to find the emissivities of the various components of this model -- a diffuse cloud, three asteroidal
dust bands, a circumsolar ring, and an Earth-trailing feature. The emissivity of the diffuse Zodiacal
cloud decreases with increasing wavelength, as expected from earlier analyses. The emissivities
of the dust bands, however, decrease less rapidly, indicating that the properties of the grains
in the bands are different than those in the diffuse cloud. As part of the analysis, we fit the small
amount of Galactic emission seen through the instrument's far sidelobes and place limits on possible
contamination of the CMB results from both Zodiacal emission and Galactic emission seen through
these far sidelobes. When necessary, these results are used in the Planck pipeline to make maps with
Zodiacal emission and far sidelobes removed. We show that the spectrum of the Zodiacal correction
to the CMB maps is small compared to the Planck CMB temperature power spectrum.
