Using deep two-color near-infrared HST imaging and unbiased grism spectroscopy we present a detailed
study of the z=1.803 JKCS041 cluster. Uniquely, for a high redshift cluster, we confirm a mass of
$\log M=14.2$ in solar units using three different techniques based on the X-ray temperature, the
X-ray luminosity and the cluster richness. JKCS041 is thus a progenitor of a local system like the
Coma cluster. Our rich dataset and the abundant population of 14 spectroscopically-confirmed
red sequence galaxies allows us to explore the past star formation history of this system in unprecedented
detail. Remarkably, we find a prominent red sequence down to stellar masses as low as $\log M=9.8$,
corresponding to a mass range of 2 dex. These quiescent galaxies are concentrated around the cluster
center with a core radius of 330 kpc. Blue members are few and avoid the cluster center. In JKCS041
quenching was therefore largely completed by a look-back time of 10 Gyr and we can constrain the epoch
at which this occurred via spectroscopic age-dating of the individual galaxies. Most galaxies
were quenched about 1.1 Gyr prior to the epoch of observation. The less massive quiescent galaxies
are somewhat younger, corresponding to a decrease in age of 650 Myr per mass dex, but the scatter in
age at fixed mass is only 380 Myr (at $\log M=11$). The size-mass relation of quiescent galaxies in
JKCS041 is consistent with that observed for local clusters within our uncertainties. Comparing
our data on JKCS041 with 41 clusters at lower redshift, we find that the form of the mass function of
red sequence galaxies has hardly evolved in the past 10 Gyr, both in terms of its faint end slope and
characteristic mass. Despite observing JKCS041 soon after its quenching and the three fold expected
increase in mass in the next 10 Gyr, it is already remarkably similar to present-day clusters.
