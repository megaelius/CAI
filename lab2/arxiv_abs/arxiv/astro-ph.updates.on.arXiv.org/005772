We aim to evaluate the properties of the quasars astrometric solution in the second release of Gaia
Release 2 (Gaia DR2). Besides the QSOs from the AllWISE AGN catalog, we also cross match the QSOs sample
from LQAC3, SDSS DRQ14 and LAMOST DR5 with the Gaia DR2. With this quasars sample (denoted as KQCG),
we estimate the global bias in parallax and proper motion, analysis the proper motion field with
the vector spherical harmonics (VSH) functions and compare with the results with different quasars
subsets. The parallaxes are expanded with the scalar spherical harmonics. And the positional comparison
between the ICRF2 sources and their counterparts in Gaia DR2 are also carried out. The mean global
parallaxes bias for the KQCG quasars is -0.0308 mas, and the median parallax is -0.0283 mas. For the
high-precision subset ($\sigma_{\omega}$<1 mas), the corresponding values are -0.0278 mas and
-0.0277 mas. The VSH analysis result of KQCG shows a different rotation compared with the Gaia-CRF2
quasars sample in the proper motion filed. The rotations of different samples are not larger than
10 $\mu as/yr$ for each axis, with the typical glide vector of KQCG is around $(-8,+10,+9)\pm2$ $\mu
as /yr$. There is a $\sim$ +0.01 mas/yr bias in the declination direction of the proper motion, and
the typical glide of the proper motion field is $(-9, +9, 0)\pm2$ $\mu as/yr$ after subtracting the
bias in $\mu_{\delta}$. The quasars sample used to define the Gaia reference frame shows a different
rotation in northern $((+2.2, +2.8,-1.5)\pm2.0$ $\mu as/yr)$ and southern $((+9.5, +8.7,+0.8)\pm2.3$
$\mu as/yr)$ hemisphere. The scalar harmonics spherical expansions of the parallaxes show a significant
RMS value about 23 $\mu as$ for the harmonic degree $l=4$. No significant rotation is found between
ICRF2 sources and their counterparts in Gaia DR2.
