2013 FY27 is the ninth intrinsically brightest Trans-Neptunian Object (TNO). We observed 2013
FY27 at thermal wavelengths with ALMA and in the optical with Magellan to determine its size and albedo
for the first time and compare it to other dwarf planets. The geometric albedo of 2013 FY27 was found
to be 0.17 -0.030+0.045, giving an effective diameter of D = 765 +80-85 km. 2013 FY27 has a size within
the transition region between the largest few TNOs that have higher albedos and higher densities
than smaller TNOs. No significant short-term optical light curve was found, with variations less
than 0.06 mags over hours and days. The Sloan optical colors of 2013 FY27 are g-r=0.76 +-0.02 and r-i=0.31
+-0.03 mags, which is a moderately red color. This color is different than the neutral or ultra-red
colors found for the ten largest TNOs, making 2013 FY27 one of the largest known moderately red TNOs,
which only start to be seen, and in abundance, at diameters less than 800 km. This suggests something
physically different might be associated with TNOs larger than 800 km. It could be that moderately
red surfaces are older or less ice rich and TNOs larger than 800 km have fresher surfaces or are able
to hold onto more volatile ices. Its also possible TNOs larger than 800 km are more fully differentiated,
giving them different surface compositions. A satellite at 0.17 arcsec away and 3.0 +-0.2 mags fainter
than 2013 FY27 was found through Hubble Space Telescope observations. Almost all the largest TNOs
have satellites, and the relative small size of 2013 FY27's satellite suggests it was created through
a direct collision, similar to satellites known around the largest TNOs. Assuming the satellite
has a similar albedo as the primary, it is about 190 km in diameter, making the primary D = 740 +85-90
km.
