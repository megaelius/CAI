The microquasar GRS 1915+105, exhibits a large variety of characteristic states, according to
its luminosity, spectral state, and variability. The most interesting one is the so-called rho-state,
whose light curve shows recurrent bursts. This paper presents a model based on Fitzhugh-Nagumo
equations containing two variables: x, linked to the source photon luminosity L detected by the
MECS, and y related to the mean photon energy. We aim at providing a simple mathematical framework
composed by non-linear differential equations useful to predict the observed light curve and the
energy lags for the rho-state and possibly other classes of the source. We studied the equilibrium
state and the stability conditions of this system that includes one external parameter, J, that
can be considered a function of the disk accretion rate. Our work is based on observations performed
with the MECS on board BeppoSAX when the source was in rho and nu mode, respectively. The evolution
of the mean count rate and photon energy were derived from a study of the trajectories in the count
rate - photon energy plane. Assuming J constant, we found a solution that reproduces the x profile
of the rho class bursts and, unexpectedly, we found that y exhibited a time modulation similar to
that of the mean energy. Moreover, assuming a slowly modulated J the solutions for x quite similar
to those observed in the nu class light curves is reproduced. According these results, the outer
mass accretion rate is probably responsible for the state transitions, but within the rho-class
it is constant. This finding makes stronger the heuristic meaning of the non-linear model and suggests
a simple relation between the variable x and y. However, how a system of dynamical equations can be
derived from the complex mathematical apparatus of accretion disks remains to be furtherly explored.
