The Kepler Mission was designed to identify and characterize transiting planets in the Kepler Field
of View and to determine their occurrence rates. Emphasis was placed on identification of Earth-size
planets orbiting in the Habitable Zone of their host stars. Science data were acquired for a period
of four years. Long-cadence data with 29.4 min sampling were obtained for ~200,000 individual stellar
targets in at least one observing quarter in the primary Kepler Mission. Light curves for target
stars are extracted in the Kepler Science Data Processing Pipeline, and are searched for transiting
planet signatures. A Threshold Crossing Event is generated in the transit search for targets where
the transit detection threshold is exceeded and transit consistency checks are satisfied. These
targets are subjected to further scrutiny in the Data Validation (DV) component of the Pipeline.
Transiting planet candidates are characterized in DV, and light curves are searched for additional
planets after transit signatures are modeled and removed. A suite of diagnostic tests is performed
on all candidates to aid in discrimination between genuine transiting planets and instrumental
or astrophysical false positives. Data products are generated per target and planet candidate
to document and display transiting planet model fit and diagnostic test results. These products
are exported to the Exoplanet Archive at the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute, and are available
to the community. We describe the DV architecture and diagnostic tests, and provide a brief overview
of the data products. Transiting planet modeling and the search for multiple planets on individual
targets are described in a companion paper. The final revision of the Kepler Pipeline code base is
available to the general public through GitHub. The Kepler Pipeline has also been modified to support
the TESS Mission which will commence in 2018.
