Background: Nuclear symmetry energy $E_{sym}(\rho)$ encoding information about the energy necessary
to make nuclear systems more neutron-rich is poorly known especially at supra-saturation densities
but has broad impacts on properties of neutron stars. While its slope parameter L at the saturation
density $\rho_0$ of nuclear matter has been relatively well constrained by recent astrophysical
observations and terrestrial nuclear experiments, its curvature $K_{\rm{sym}}$ characterizing
the $E_{sym}(\rho)$ around $2\rho_0$ remains largely unconstrained. Over 520 calculations for
$E_{sym}(\rho)$ using various nuclear theories and interactions in the literature have predicted
several significantly different $K_{\rm{sym}}-L$ correlations. Purpose: If a unique $K_{\rm{sym}}-L$
correlation of $E_{sym}(\rho)$ can be firmly established, it will enable us to progressively better
constrain the high-density behavior of $E_{sym}(\rho)$ using the available constraints on its
slope parameter L. We investigate if and by how much the different $K_{\rm{sym}}-L$ correlations
may affect neutron star observables. Method: A meta-model of nuclear Equation of States (EOSs)
with three representative $K_{\rm{sym}}-L$ correlation functions is used to generate multiple
EOSs for neutron stars. We then examine effects of the $K_{\rm{sym}}-L$ correlation on the crust-core
transition density and pressure as well as the radius and tidal deformation of canonical neutron
stars. Results:The $K_{\rm{sym}}-L$ correlation affects significantly both the crust-core
transition density and pressure. It also has strong imprints on the radius and tidal deformability
of canonical neutron stars especially at small L values. The available data from LIGO/VIRGO and
NICER set some useful limits for the slope L but can not distinguish the three representative $K_{\rm{sym}}-L$
correlations considered.
