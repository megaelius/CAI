This paper is a sequel to our previous one (Kato et al.2015), which calculated the luminosities and
spectra of electron-type anti-neutrinos ($\bar{\nu}_e$'s) from the progenitors of core-collapse
supernovae. Expecting that a capability to detect electron-type neutrinos ($\nu_e$'s) will increase
dramatically with the emergence of liquid-argon detectors such as DUNE, we broaden the scope in
this study to include all-flavors of neutrinos emitted from the pre-bounce phase. We pick up three
progenitor models of an electron capture supernova (ECSN) and iron-core collapse supernovae (FeCCSNe).
We find that the number luminosities reach $\sim10^{57} \mathrm{s^{-1}}$ and $\sim10^{53} \mathrm{s^{-1}}$
at maximum for $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$, respectively. We also estimate the numbers of detection
events at terrestrial neutrino detectors including DUNE, taking flavor oscillations into account
and assuming the distance to the progenitors to be 200 pc. It is demonstrated that $\bar{\nu}_e$'s
from the ECSN-progenitor will be undetected at almost all detectors, whereas we will be able to observe
$\gtrsim$15900 $\nu_e$'s at DUNE for the inverted mass hierarchy. From the FeCCSN-progenitors,
the number of $\bar{\nu}_e$ events will be largest for JUNO, 200-900 $\bar{\nu}_e$'s, depending
on the mass hierarchy whereas the number of $\nu_e$ events at DUNE is $\gtrsim$2100 for the inverted
mass hierarchy. These results imply that the detection of $\bar{\nu}_e$'s is useful to distinguish
FeCCSN- from ECSN-progenitors, while $\nu_e$'s will provide us with detailed information on the
collapse phase regardless of the type and mass of progenitor.
