More than half of the dust and heavy element enrichment in galaxies originates from the winds and
outflows of evolved, low-to-intermediate mass stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). However,
numerous details of the physics of late-stage stellar mass loss remain poorly understood, ranging
from the wind launching mechanism(s) to the geometry and timescales of the mass loss. One of the major
challenges to understanding AGB winds is that the AGB evolutionary phase is characterized by the
interplay between highly complex and dynamic processes, including radial pulsations, shocks,
magnetic fields, opacity changes due to dust and molecule formation, and large-scale convective
flows. Collectively, these phenomena lead to changes in the observed stellar properties on timescales
of days to years. Probing the complex atmospheric physics of AGB stars therefore demands exquisite
spatial resolution, coupled with temporal monitoring over both short and long timescales. Observations
of the molecular maser lines that arise in the winds and outflows of AGB stars using very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI) offer one of the most powerful tools available to measure the atmospheric
dynamics, physical conditions, and magnetic fields with ultra-high spatial resolution (i.e.,
up to tens of microarcseconds, corresponding to ~0.002R* at d~150pc), coupled with the ability
to track features and phenomena on timescales of days to years. Observational advances in the coming
decade will enable contemporaneous observations of an unprecedented number of maser transitions
spanning centimeter to submillimeter wavelengths. In evolved stars, observations of masers within
the winds and outflows are poised to provide groundbreaking new insights into the atmospheric physics
and mass-loss process.
