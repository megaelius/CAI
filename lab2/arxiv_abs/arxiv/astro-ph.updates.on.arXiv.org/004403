Hard, non-thermal, persistent pulsed X-ray emission extending between 10 keV and $\sim 150$ keV
has been observed in nearly ten magnetars. For inner-magnetospheric models of such emission, resonant
inverse Compton scattering of soft thermal photons by ultra-relativistic charges is the most efficient
production mechanism. We present angle-dependent upscattering spectra and pulsed intensity
maps for uncooled, relativistic electrons injected in inner regions of magnetar magnetospheres,
calculated using collisional integrals over field loops. Our computations employ a new formulation
of the QED Compton scattering cross section in strong magnetic fields that is physically correct
for treating important spin-dependent effects in the cyclotron resonance, thereby producing
correct photon spectra. The spectral cut-off energies are sensitive to the choices of observer
viewing geometry, electron Lorentz factor, and scattering kinematics. We find that electrons
with energies $\lesssim 15$ MeV will emit most of their radiation below 250 keV, consistent with
inferred turnovers for magnetar hard X-ray tails. More energetic electrons still emit mostly below
1 MeV, except for viewing perspectives sampling field line tangents. Pulse profiles may be singly-
or doubly-peaked dependent upon viewing geometry, emission locale, and observed energy band.
Magnetic pair production and photon splitting will attenuate spectra to hard X-ray energies, suppressing
signals in the Fermi-LAT band. The resonant Compton spectra are strongly polarized, suggesting
that hard X-ray polarimetry instruments such as X-Calibur, or a future Compton telescope, can prove
central to constraining model geometry and physics.
