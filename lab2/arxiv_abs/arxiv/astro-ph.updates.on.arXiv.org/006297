With a total integration time of 168 hours and a narrowband (NB) filter tuned to Lyman alpha at z = 8.8,
the UltraVISTA survey has set out to find some of the most distant galaxies, on the verge of the Epoch
of Reionization. Previous calculations of the expected number of detected Lya-emitting galaxies
(LAEs) at this redshift did not explicitly take into account the radiative transfer (RT) of Lya.
In this work we combine a theoretical model for the halo mass function with numerical results from
high-res cosmological hydrosimulations with LyC+Lya RT, assessing the visibility of LAEs residing
in these halos. Uncertainties such as cosmic variance and the anisotropic escape of Lya are taken
into account, and it is predicted that once the survey has finished, the probabilities of detecting
none, one, or more than one are ~90%, ~10%, and ~1%; a significantly smaller success rate compared
to earlier predictions, due to the combined effect of a highly neutral IGM scattering Lya to such
large distances from the galaxy that they fall outside the observational aperture, and to the actual
depth of the survey being less than predicted. Because the IGM affects NB and broadband (BB) magnitudes
differently, we argue for a relaxed color selection criterion of NB - BB ~ +0.85. But since the flux
is continuum-dominated, even if a galaxy is detectable in the NB its probability of being selected
as a NB excess object is <~35%. Various properties of galaxies at this redshift are predicted, e.g.
UV and Lya LFs, M*-Mh relation, spectral shape, optimal aperture, and the anisotropic escape of
Lya through both a dusty ISM and a partly neutral IGM. Finally, we describe and publish a fast numerical
code for adding numbers with asymmetric uncertainties ("x_{-sigma_1}^{+sigma_2}") proving
to be significantly better than the standard, but wrong, way of adding upper and lower uncertainties
in quadrature separately.
