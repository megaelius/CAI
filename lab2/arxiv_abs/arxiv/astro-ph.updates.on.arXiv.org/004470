Our knowledge of the intrinsic parameters of exoplanets is as precise as our determinations of their
stellar hosts parameters. In the case of radial velocity searches for planets, stellar masses appear
to be crucial. But before estimating stellar masses properly, detailed spectroscopic analysis
is essential. With this paper we conclude a general spectroscopic description of the Pennsylvania-Torun
Planet Search (PTPS) sample of stars. We aim at a detailed description of basic parameters of stars
representing the complete PTPS sample. We present atmospheric and physical parameters for dwarf
stars observed within the PTPS along with updated physical parameters for the remaining stars from
this sample after the first Gaia data release. We used high resolution (R=60 000) and high signal-to-noise-ratio
(S/N=150-250) spectra from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope and its High Resolution Spectrograph.
Stellar atmospheric parameters were determined through a strictly spectroscopic local thermodynamic
equilibrium analysis (LTE) of the equivalent widths of FeI and FeII lines. Stellar masses, ages,
and luminosities were estimated through a Bayesian analysis of theoretical isochrones. We present
$T_{eff}$, log$g$ , [Fe/H], micrturbulence velocities, absolute radial velocities, and rotational
velocities for 156 stars from the dwarf sample of PTPS. For most of these stars these are the first
determinations. We refine the definition of PTPS subsamples of stars (giants, subgiants, and dwarfs)
and update the luminosity classes for all PTPS stars. Using available Gaia and Hipparcos parallaxes,
we redetermine the stellar parameters (masses, radii, luminosities, and ages) for 451 PTPS stars.
The complete PTPS sample of 885 stars is composed of 132 dwarfs, 238 subgiants, and 515 giants, of
which the vast majority are of roughly solar mass.
