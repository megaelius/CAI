We report on two millimeter flares detected by ALMA at 220 GHz from AU Mic, a nearby M dwarf. The larger
flare had a duration of only $\sim35$ sec, with peak $L_{R}=2\times10^{15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$,
and lower limit on linear polarization of $|Q/I|>0.12\pm0.04$. We examine the characteristics
common to these new AU Mic events and those from Proxima Cen previously reported in MacGregor et al.
(2018) - namely short durations, negative spectral indices, and significant linear polarization
- to provide new diagnostics of conditions in outer stellar atmospheres and details of stellar flare
particle acceleration. The event rates ($\sim20$ and $4$ events day$^{-1}$ for AU Mic and Proxima
Cen, respectively) suggest that millimeter flares occur commonly but have been undetected until
now. Analysis of the flare observing frequency and consideration of possible incoherent emission
mechanisms confirms the presence of MeV electrons in the stellar atmosphere occurring as part of
the flare process. The spectral indices point to a hard distribution of electrons. The short durations
and lack of pronounced exponential decay in the light curve are consistent with formation in a simple
magnetic loop, with radio emission predominating from directly precipitating electrons. We consider
the possibility of both synchrotron and gyrosynchrotron emission mechanisms, although synchrotron
is favored given the linear polarization signal. This would imply that the emission must be occurring
in a low density environment of only modest magnetic field strength. A deeper understanding of this
newly discovered and apparently common stellar flare mechanism awaits more observations with
better-studied flare components at other wavelengths.
