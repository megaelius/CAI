In big data era, the special data with rare characteristics may be of great significations. However,
it is very difficult to automatically search these samples from the massive and high-dimensional
datasets and systematically evaluate them. The DoPS, our previous work [2], provided a search method
of rare spectra with double-peaked profiles from massive and high-dimensional data of LAMOST survey.
The identification of the results is mainly depended on visually inspection by astronomers. In
this paper, as a follow-up study, a new lattice structure named SVM-Lattice is designed based on
SVM(Support Vector Machine) and FCL(Formal Concept Lattice) and particularly applied in the recognition
and evaluation of rare spectra with double-peaked profiles. First, each node in the SVM-Lattice
structure contains two components: the intents are defined by the support vectors trained by the
spectral samples with the specific characteristics, and the relevant extents are all the positive
samples classified by the support vectors. The hyperplanes can be extracted from every lattice
node and used as classifiers to search targets by categories. A generalization and specialization
relationship is expressed between the layers, and higher layers indicate higher confidence of
targets. Then, including a SVM-Lattice building algorithm, a pruning algorithm based on association
rules, and an evaluation algorithm, the supporting algorithms are provided and analysed. Finally,
for the recognition and evaluation of spectra with double-peaked profiles, several data sets from
LAMOST survey are used as experimental dataset. The results exhibit good consistency with traditional
methods, more detailed and accurate evaluations of classification results, and higher searching
efficiency than other similar methods.
