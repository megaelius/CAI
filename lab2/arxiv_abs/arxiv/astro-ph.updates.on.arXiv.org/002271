We present a newly developed version of BayeSED, a general Bayesian approach to the spectral energy
distribution (SED) fitting of galaxies. The new BayeSED code has been systematically tested on
a mock sample of galaxies. The comparison between estimated and inputted value of the parameters
show that BayeSED can recover the physical parameters of galaxies reasonably well. We then applied
BayeSED to interpret the SEDs of a large Ks-selected sample of galaxies in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA
field with stellar population synthesis models. With the new BayeSED code, a Bayesian model comparison
of stellar population synthesis models has been done for the first time. We found that the model by
Bruzual & Charlot (2003), statistically speaking, has larger Bayesian evidence than the model
by Maraston (2005) for the Ks-selected sample. Besides, while setting the stellar metallicity
as a free parameter obviously increases the Bayesian evidence of both models, varying the IMF has
a notable effect only on the Maraston (2005) model. Meanwhile, the physical parameters estimated
with BayeSED are found to be generally consistent with those obtained with the popular grid-based
FAST code, while the former exhibits more natural distributions. Based on the estimated physical
parameters of galaxies in the sample, we qualitatively classified the galaxies in the sample into
five populations that may represent galaxies at different evolution stages or in different environments.
We conclude that BayeSED could be a reliable and powerful tool for investigating the formation and
evolution of galaxies from the rich multi-wavelength observations currently available. A binary
version of MPI parallelized BayeSED code is publicly available at https://bitbucket.org/hanyk/bayesed.
