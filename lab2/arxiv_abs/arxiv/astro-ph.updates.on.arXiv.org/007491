We present SCExAO/CHARIS high-contrast imaging/$JHK$ integral field spectroscopy of $\kappa$
And b, a directly-imaged low-mass companion orbiting a nearby B9V star. We detect $\kappa$ And b
at a high signal-to-noise and extract high precision spectrophotometry using a new forward-modeling
algorithm for (A-)LOCI complementary to KLIP-FM developed by Pueyo (2016). $\kappa$ And b's spectrum
best resembles that of a low-gravity L0--L1 dwarf (L0--L1$\gamma$). Its spectrum and luminosity
are very well matched by 2MASSJ0141-4633 and several other 12.5--15 $M_{\rm J}$ free floating members
of the 40 $Myr$-old Tuc-Hor Association, consistent with a system age derived from recent interferometric
results for the primary, a companion mass at/near the deuterium-burning limit (13$^{+12}_{-2}$
M$_{\rm J}$), and a companion-to-primary mass ratio characteristic of other directly-imaged
planets ($q$ $\sim$ 0.005$^{+0.005}_{-0.001}$). We did not unambiguously identify additional,
more closely-orbiting companions brighter and more massive than $\kappa$ And b down to $\rho$ $\sim$
0.3" (15 au). SCExAO/CHARIS and complementary Keck/NIRC2 astrometric points reveal clockwise
orbital motion. Modeling points towards a likely eccentric orbit: a subset of acceptable orbits
include those that are aligned with the star's rotation axis. However, $\kappa$ And b's semimajor
axis is plausibly larger than 75 au and in a region where disk instability could form massive companions.
Deeper $\kappa$ And high-contrast imaging and low-resolution spectroscopy from extreme AO systems
like SCExAO/CHARIS and higher resolution spectroscopy from Keck/OSIRIS or, later, IRIS on the
Thirty Meter Telescope could help clarify $\kappa$ And b's chemistry and whether its spectrum provides
an insight into its formation environment.
