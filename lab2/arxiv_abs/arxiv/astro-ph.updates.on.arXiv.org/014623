We test the ability of two unsupervised machine learning algorithms, \textit{EnLink} and Shared
Nearest Neighbour (SNN), to identify stellar groupings in the Orion star-forming complex as an
application to the 5-dimensional astrometric data from \textit{Gaia} DR2. The algorithms represent
two distinct approaches to limiting user bias when selecting parameter values and evaluating the
relative weights among astrometric parameters. \textit{EnLink} adopts a locally adaptive distance
metric and eliminates the need of parameter tuning through automation. The original SNN relies
only on human input for parameter tuning so we modified SNN to run in two stages. We first ran the original
SNN 7,000 times, each with a randomly generated sample according to within-source co-variance
matrices provided in \textit{Gaia} DR2 and random parameter values within reasonable ranges.
During the second stage, we modified SNN to identify the most repeating stellar groups from 25,798
we obtained in the first stage. We reveal 21 spatially- and kinematically-coherent groups in the
Orion complex, 12 of which previously unknown. The groups show a wide distribution of distances
extending as far as about 150 pc in front of the star-forming Orion molecular clouds, to about 50 pc
beyond them where we find, unexpectedly, several groups. Our results expose to view the wealth of
sub-structure in the OB association, within and beyond the classical Blaauw Orion OBI sub-groups.
A full characterization of the new groups is of the essence as it offers the potential to unveil how
star formation proceeds globally in large complexes such as Orion. The data and code that generated
the groups in this work as well as the final table can be found at \protect\url{ https://github.com/BoquanErwinChen/GaiaDR2_Orion_Dissection}.
