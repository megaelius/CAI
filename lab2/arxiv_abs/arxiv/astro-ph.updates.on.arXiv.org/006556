Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) travel from the Galactic Centre to the dark matter halo of the Milky Way,
where they are observed with velocities in excess of the Galactic escape speed. Their trajectories
make them a unique probe of the still poorly constrained dark matter component of the Galaxy. In this
paper, we present a new method to constrain the Galactic potential with HVSs. The likelihood is constructed
by efficiently calculating the local HVS density at any point of the Galaxy by back-propagating
the phase space position and quantifying the ejection probability along the orbit. This method
is particularly suited to the data from the ESA mission {\it Gaia}. Therefore, to showcase our method,
we applied it to a simulated \Gaia sample of $\sim200$ stars in Galactic potentials with three different
dark matter components, parametrized by a spheroidal NFW profile. We find that individual HVSs
exhibit a degeneracy in the scale mass-scale radius plane ($M_s-r_s$) and are able to measure only
the combination $\alpha = M_s/r_s^2$, likewise a degeneracy is also present between $\alpha$ and
the spheroidal axis-ratio $q$. When the whole sample is considered, both parameters are nailed
down with {\it sub-percentage} precision (about $1\%$ and $0.1\%$ for $\alpha$ and $q$ respectively)
and no systematic bias is observed. This remarkable power to constrain deviations from a symmetric
halo is a consequence of the Galactocentric origin of HVSs. To compare our results with other probes,
we break the degeneracy in the scale parameters and impose a mass-concentration relation. The result
is a competitive precision on the virial mass $M_{200}$ of about $10\%$.
