We predict the existence and observational signatures of a new class of objects that assembled early,
during the first billion years of cosmic time: Obese Black-hole Galaxies (OBGs). OBGs are objects
in which the mass of the central black hole initially exceeds that of the stellar component of the
host galaxy, and the luminosity from black-hole accretion dominates the starlight. From a cosmological
simulation, we demonstrate that there are sites where star formation is initially inhibited and
direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) form due to the photo-dissociating effect of Lyman-Werner
radiation on molecular hydrogen. We show that the formation of OBGs is inevitable, because the probability
of finding the required extra-galactic environment and the right physical conditions in a halo
conducive to DCBH formation is quite high in the early universe. We estimate an OBG number density
of 0.009/Mpc^3 at z~8 and 0.03/Mpc^3 at z~6. Extrapolating from our simulation volume, we infer
that the most luminous quasars detected at z~6 likely transited through an earlier OBG phase. We
find that these primordial galaxies start off with an over-massive BH and acquire their stellar
component from subsequent merging as well as in-situ star formation. In doing so, they inevitably
go through an OBG phase dominated by the accretion luminosity at the Eddington rate or below, released
from the growing BH. The OBG phase is characterised by an ultra-violet (UV) spectrum with slope of
beta ~ -2.3 and the absence of a Balmer Break. OBGs should also be spatially unresolved, and are expected
to be brighter than the majority of known high-redshift galaxies. OBGs could potentially be revealed
via HST follow-up imaging of samples of brighter Lyman-break galaxies provided by wide-area ground-based
surveys such as UltraVISTA, and should be easily uncovered and studied with instruments aboard
