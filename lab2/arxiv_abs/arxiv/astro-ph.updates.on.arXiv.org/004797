Stars are changing entities in a constant evolution during their lives. At non-secular time scales
(from seconds to years) the effect of dynamical processes such as convection, rotation, and magnetic
fields can modify the stellar oscillations. Convection excites acoustic modes in solar-like stars,
while rotation and magnetic fields can perturb the oscillation frequencies lifting the degeneracy
in the azimuthal component m of the eigenfrequencies. Moreover, the interaction between rotation,
convection, and magnetic fields can produce magnetic dynamos, which sometimes yield to regular
magnetic activity cycles. In this chapter we review how stellar dynamics can be studied and explain
what long-term seismic observations can bring to the understanding of this field. Thus, we show
how we can study some properties of the convective time scales operating in a star like the Sun. We
also compare the stratified information we can obtain on the internal (radial) differential rotation
from main sequence solar-like stars, to the Sun, and to more evolved sub giants, and giants. We complement
this information on the internal rotation with the determination of the surface (latitudinal differential)
rotation obtained directly from the light curves. Indeed, when stars are active there can be spots
on their surfaces dimming the light emitted. When the star rotates, the emitted light will be modulated
by the presence of these spots with a period corresponding to the rotation rate at the active latitudes
(where the spots develop). We conclude this chapter by discussing the seismology of fast rotating
stars and, from a theoretical point of view, what are the current challenges to infer properties
of the internal structure and dynamics of intermediate- and high-mass stars.
