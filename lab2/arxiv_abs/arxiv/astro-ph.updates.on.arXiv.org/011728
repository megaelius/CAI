Moist convective storms in Jupiter develop frequently and can trigger atmospheric activity of
different scales, from localized storms to planetary-scale disturbances including convective
activity confined inside a larger meteorological system. In February 2018 a series of convective
storms erupted in Jupiter's South Temperate Belt (STB) (planetocentric latitudes from -23$^{\circ}$
to -29.5$^{\circ}$). This occurred inside an elongated cyclonic region known popularly as the
STB Ghost, close to the large anticyclone Oval BA, resulting in the clouds from the storms being confined
to the cyclone. The initial storms lasted only a few days but they generated abundant enduring turbulence.
They also produced dark features, possibly partially devoid of clouds, that circulated around
the cyclone over the first week. The subsequent activity developed over months and resulted in two
main structures, one of them closely interacting with Oval BA and the other one being expelled to
the west. Here we present a study of this meteorological activity based on daily observations provided
by the amateur community, complemented by observations obtained from PlanetCam UPV/EHU at Calar
Alto Observatory, the Hubble Space Telescope and by JunoCam on the Juno spacecraft. We also perform
numerical simulations with the EPIC General Circulation Model to reproduce the phenomenology
observed. The successful simulations require a complex interplay between the Ghost, the convective
eruptions and Oval BA, and they demonstrate that water moist convection was the source of the initial
storms. A simple scale comparison with other moist convective storms that can be observed in the
planet in visible and methane absorption band images strongly suggests that most of these storms
are powered by water condensation instead of ammonia.
