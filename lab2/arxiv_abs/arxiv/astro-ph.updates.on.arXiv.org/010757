This paper outlines the science case for line-intensity mapping with a space-borne instrument
targeting the sub-millimeter (microwaves) to the far-infrared (FIR) wavelength range. Our goal
is to observe and characterize the large-scale structure in the Universe from present times to the
high redshift Epoch of Reionization. This is essential to constrain the cosmology of our Universe
and form a better understanding of various mechanisms that drive galaxy formation and evolution.
We argue that the proposed frequency range would make it possible to probe important metal cooling
lines such as [CII] up to very high redshift as well as a large number of rotational lines of the CO molecule.
These can be used to trace molecular gas and dust evolution and constrain the buildup in both the cosmic
star formation rate density and the cosmic infrared background (CIB). Moreover, surveys at the
highest frequencies will detect FIR lines which are used as diagnostics of galaxies and AGN. Tomography
of these lines over a wide redshift range will enable invaluable measurements of the cosmic expansion
history at epochs inaccessible to other methods, competitive constraints on the parameters of
the standard model of cosmology, and numerous tests of dark matter, dark energy, modified gravity
and inflation. To reach these goals, large-scale structure must be mapped over a wide range in frequency
to trace its time evolution over a reasonable fraction of the volume of the observable Universe.
In addition, the surveyed area needs to be very large to beat cosmic variance and to probe the largest
scales where its easier to separate the astrophysical and cosmological contributions to the observed
signal. Only, a space-borne mission can properly meet these requirements.
