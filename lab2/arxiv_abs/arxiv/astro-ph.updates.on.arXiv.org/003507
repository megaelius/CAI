The routinely flaring events from \sgras\ trace dynamic, high-energy processes in the immediate
vicinity of the supermassive black hole. We statistically study temporal and spectral properties,
as well as fluence and duration distributions, of the flares detected by the \chandra\ X-ray Observatory
from 1999 to 2012. The detection incompleteness and bias are carefully accounted for in determining
these distributions. We find that the fluence distribution can be well characterized by a power-law
with a slope of $1.73^{+0.20}_{-0.19}$, while the durations ($\tau$ in seconds) by a log-normal
function with a mean $\log(\tau)=3.39^{+0.27}_{-0.24}$ and an intrinsic dispersion $\sigma=0.28^{+0.08}_{-0.06}$.
No significant correlation between the fluence and duration is detected. The apparent positive
correlation, as reported previously, is mainly due to the detection bias (i.e., weak flares can
be detected only when their durations are short). These results indicate that the simple self-organized
criticality model has difficulties in explaining these flares. We further find that bright flares
usually have asymmetric lightcurves with no statistically evident difference/preference between
the rising and decaying phases in terms of their spectral/timing properties. Our spectral analysis
shows that although a power-law model with a photon index of $2.0\pm0.4$ gives a satisfactory fit
to the joint spectra of strong and weak flares, there is weak evidence for a softer spectrum of weaker
flares. This work demonstrates the potential to use statistical properties of X-ray flares to probe
their trigger and emission mechanisms, as well as the radiation propagation around the black hole.
