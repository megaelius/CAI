(${Abridged~version}$) We review how the single degenerate models for Type Ia supernovae (SNe
Ia) works. In the binary star system of a white dwarf (WD) and its non-degenerate companion star,
the WD accretes either H-rich matter or He and undergoes H and He shell-burning. We summarize how
such shell-burning depend on the accretion rate and the WD mass and how the WD blows strong wind. We
identify the following evolutionary routes for the accreting WD to trigger a thermonuclear explosion.
With a decreasing rate with time, 5 phases are observed: 1. The WD increases its mass by stable H burning
and blows a strong wind, which strips a part of the companion star's envelope to control the accretion
rate and forms circumstellar matter (CSM). The WD may explode within CSM as an "SN Ia-CSM". 2. The
wind stops and an SN Ia is triggered under steady-stable H shell-burning, which is observed as a super-soft
X-ray source: "SN Ia-SSXS". 3. H shell-burning becomes unstable and many flashes recur. The WD undergoes
recurrent nova (RN) whose mass ejection is smaller than the accreted matter, evolving to an "SN Ia-RN".
4. If the companion is a He star or WD, the accretion of He can trigger He and C double detonations at
the sub-Chandrasekhar (sub-Chand) mass or the WD grows to the Chand mass while producing and He-wind:
"SN Ia-He CSM". 5. If the accreting WD rotates rapidly, delayed trigger of an SN Ia beyond standard
Chand mass can happen. The (super-Chand) WD contracts to become a delayed SN Ia after losing angular
momentum. The companion star has become a He WD and CSM has disappeared: "SN Ia-He WD". We update nucleosynthesis
yields of the carbon deflagration model W7, delayed detonation model WDD2, and the sub-Chand mass
model to constrain the yields (such as Mn) by comparing the observations. We note the important metallicity
effects on $^{58}$Ni and $^{55}$Mn.
