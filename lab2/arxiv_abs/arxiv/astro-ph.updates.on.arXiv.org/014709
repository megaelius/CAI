We present Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array observations of the candidate jet-ISM
interaction zones near the black hole X-ray binaries GRS 1758$-$258 and 1E 1740.7$-$2942. Using
these data, we map the molecular line emission in the regions, detecting emission from the HCN [$J=1-0$],
HCO$^+$ [$J=1-0$], SiO [$J=2-1$], CS [$J=2-1$], $^{13}$CO [$J=1-0$], C$^{18}$O [$J=1-0$], HNCO
[$J=4_{0,4}-3_{0,3}$], HNCO [$J=5_{0,5}-4_{0,4}$], and CH$_3$OH [$J=2_{1,1}-1_{1,0}$] molecular
transitions. Through examining the morphological, spectral, and kinematic properties of this
emission, we identify molecular structures that may trace jet-driven cavities in the gas surrounding
these systems. Our results from the GRS 1758$-$258 region in particular, are consistent with recent
work, which postulated the presence of a jet-blown cocoon structure in deep radio continuum maps
of the region. Using these newly discovered molecular structures as calorimeters, we estimate
the time averaged jet power from these systems, finding $(1.1-5.7)\times10^{36}{\rm erg\,s}^{-1}$
over $0.12-0.31$ Myr for GRS 1758$-$258 and $(0.7-3.5)\times10^{37}{\rm erg\,s}^{-1}$ over
$0.10-0.26$ Myr for 1E 1740.7$-$2942. Additionally, the spectral line characteristics of the
detected emission place these molecular structures in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy,
thereby constraining the distances to the black hole X-ray binaries to be $8.0\pm1.0$ kpc. Overall,
our analysis solidifies the diagnostic capacity of molecular lines, and highlights how astro-chemistry
can both identify jet-ISM interaction zones and probe jet feedback from Galactic X-ray binaries.
