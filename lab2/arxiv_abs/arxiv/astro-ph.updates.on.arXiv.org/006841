Eta Car is one of the most intriguing luminous blue variables in the Galaxy. Observations and models
at different wavelengths suggest a central binary with a 5.54 yr period residing in its core. 2D and
3D radiative transfer and hydrodynamic simulations predict a primary with a dense and slow stellar
wind that interacts with the faster and lower density wind of the secondary. The wind-wind collision
scenario suggests that the secondary's wind penetrates the primary's wind creating a low-density
cavity in it, with dense walls where the two winds interact. We aim to trace the inner ~5-50 au structure
of Eta Car's wind-wind interaction, as seen through BrG and, for the first time, through the He I 2s-2p
line. We have used spectro-interferometric observations with GRAVITY at the VLTI. Our modeling
of the continuum allows us to estimate its FWHM angular size close to 2 mas and an elongation ratio
of 1.06 +/- 0.05 over a PA = 130 +/- 20 deg. Our CMFGEN modeling helped us to confirm that the role of the
secondary should be taken into account to properly reproduce the observed BrG and He I lines. Chromatic
images across BrG reveal a southeast arc-like feature, possibly associated to the hot post-shocked
winds flowing along the cavity wall. The images of He I 2s-2p served to constrain the 20 mas structure
of the line-emitting region. The observed morphology of He I suggests that the secondary is responsible
for the ionized material that produces the line profile. Both the BrG and the He I 2s-2p maps are consistent
with previous hydrodynamical models of the colliding wind scenario. Future dedicated simulations
together with an extensive interferometric campaign are necessary to refine our constraints on
the wind and stellar parameters of the binary, which finally will help us predict the evolutionary
path of Eta Car.
