[Abridged] The measurement of the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation is
one of the current frontiers in cosmology. In particular, the detection of the primordial B-modes,
could reveal the presence of gravitational waves in the early Universe. The detection of such component
is at the moment the most promising technique to probe the inflationary theory describing the very
early evolution of the Universe. We present the updated performance forecast of the Large Scale
Polarization Explorer (LSPE), a program dedicated to the measurement of the CMB polarization.
LSPE is composed of two instruments: Strip, a radiometer-based telescope on the ground in Tenerife,
and SWIPE (Short-Wavelength Instrument for the Polarization Explorer) a bolometer-based instrument
designed to fly on a winter arctic stratospheric long-duration balloon. The program is among the
few dedicated to observation of the Northern Hemisphere, while most of the international effort
is focused into ground-based observation in the Southern Hemisphere. Measurements are currently
scheduled in Winter 2021/22 for SWIPE, with a flight duration up to 15 days, and in Summer 2021 with
two years observations for Strip. We describe the main features of the two instruments, identifying
the most critical aspects of the design, in terms of impact into performance forecast. We estimate
the expected sensitivity of each instrument and propagate their combined observing power to the
sensitivity to cosmological parameters, including the effect of scanning strategy, component
separation, residual foregrounds and partial sky coverage. We also set requirements on the control
of the most critical systematic effects and describe techniques to mitigate their impact. LSPE
can reach a sensitivity in tensor-to-scalar ratio of $\sigma_r<0.01$, and improve constrains
on other cosmological parameters.
