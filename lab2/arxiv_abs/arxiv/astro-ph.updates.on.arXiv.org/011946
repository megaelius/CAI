RefPlanets is a guaranteed time observation (GTO) programme that uses the Zurich IMaging POLarimeter
(ZIMPOL) of SPHERE/VLT for a blind search for exoplanets in wavelengths from 600-900 nm. The goals
of this study are the characterization of the unprecedented high polarimetic contrast and polarimetric
precision capabilities of ZIMPOL for bright targets, the search for polarized reflected light
around some of the closest bright stars to the Sun and potentially the direct detection of an evolved
cold exoplanet for the first time. For our observations of Alpha Cen A and B, Sirius A, Altair, Eps
Eri and Tau Ceti we used the polarimetric differential imaging (PDI) mode of ZIMPOL which removes
the speckle noise down to the photon noise limit for angular separations >0.6". We describe some
of the instrumental effects that dominate the noise for smaller separations and explain how to remove
these additional noise effects in post-processing. We then combine PDI with angular differential
imaging (ADI) as a final layer of post-processing to further improve the contrast limits of our data
at these separations. For good observing conditions we achieve polarimetric contrast limits of
15.0-16.3 mag at the effective inner working angle of about 0.13", 16.3-18.3 mag at 0.5" and 18.8-20.4
mag at 1.5". The contrast limits closer in (<0.6") depend significantly on the observing conditions,
while in the photon noise dominated regime (>0.6"), the limits mainly depend on the brightness of
the star and the total integration time. We compare our results with contrast limits from other surveys
and review the exoplanet detection limits obtained with different detection methods. For all our
targets we achieve unprecedented contrast limits. Despite the high polarimetric contrasts we
are not able to find any additional companions or extended polarized light sources in the data that
has been taken so far.
