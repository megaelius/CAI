The old (7 Gyr) open cluster NGC 188 has yielded a wealth of astrophysical insight into its rich blue
straggler population. Specifically, the NGC 188 blue stragglers are characterized by: A binary
frequency of 80% for orbital periods less than $10^4$ days;Typical orbital periods around 1000
days;Typical secondary star masses of 0.5 M$_{\odot}$; At least some white dwarf companion stars;
Modestly rapid rotation; A bimodal radial spatial distribution; Dynamical masses greater than
standard stellar evolution masses (based on short-period binaries); Under-luminosity for dynamical
masses (short-period binaries). Extensive $N$-body modeling of NGC 188 with empirical initial
conditions reproduces the properties of the cluster, and in particular the main-sequence solar-type
binary population. The current models also reproduce well the binary orbital properties of the
blue stragglers, but fall well short of producing the observed number of blue stragglers. This deficit
could be resolved by reducing the frequency of common-envelope evolution during Roche lobe overflow.
Both the observations and the $N$-body models strongly indicate that the long-period blue-straggler
binaries - which dominate the NGC 188 blue straggler population - are formed by asymptotic-giant
(primarily) and red-giant mass transfer onto main sequence stars. The models suggest that the few
non-velocity-variable blue stragglers formed from mergers or collisions. Several remarkable
short-period double-lined binaries point to the importance of subsequent dynamical exchange
encounters, and provide at least one example of a likely collisional origin for a blue straggler.
