The Juno mission will measure Jupiter's magnetic field with unprecedented precision and provide
a wealth of additional data that will allow to constrain the planet's interior structure and dynamics.
Here we analyse 66 numerical simulations in order to explore the sensitivity of the dynamo-generated
magnetic field to the planets interior properties. The degree l=4 field model VIP4 and up-to-date
interior models based on ab initio simulations serve as benchmarks. Our results suggest that VIP4-like
magnetic fields can be found for a number of different models. We find that whether we assume an ideal
gas or use the more realistic interior model based on ab initio simulations makes no difference.
However, two other factors are important. Low Rayleigh number leads to strong axial dipole contribution
while the axial dipole dominance is lost when the convective driving is too strong. The required
intermediate range that yields Jupiter-like magnetic fields depends on the other system properties.
The second factor is the convective magnetic Reynolds number profile Rmc(r), a product of the non-axisymmetric
flow velocity and electrical conductivity. We find that the depth where Rmc exceeds about 50 is a
good proxy for the top of the dynamo region. When the dynamo region sits too deep, the axial dipole
is once more too dominant due to geometric reasons. We extrapolated our results to Jupiter and the
result suggests that the Jovian dynamo extends to 95% of the planetary radius. The zonal flows in
our simulations are dominated by an equatorial jet largely confined to the molecular layer. Where
the jet reaches down to higher electrical conductivities, it is gives rise to a secondary alpha-Omega
dynamo that modifies the dipole-dominated field produced deeper in the planet. This secondary
dynamo can lead to strong magnetic field patches at low latitudes that seem compatible with the VIP4
model.
