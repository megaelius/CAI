Nowadays there are several observational studies about the 13CO/C18O abundance ratio (X) towards
nearby molecular clouds. These works give observational support to the C18O selective photodissociation
due to the interaction between the FUV radiation and the molecular gas. It is necessary to increase
the sample of molecular clouds located at different distances and affected in different ways by
nearby or embedded HII regions and OB associations to study the selective photodissociation. Using
12CO, 13CO, and C18O J=1-0 data obtained from the FOREST Survey, we analyze the filamentary infrared
dark cloud IRDC34.43+0.24 located at the distance of about 3.9 kpc. This IRDC is related to several
HII regions and YSOs. Assuming LTE we obtain: 0.8x10^16<N(13CO)<4x10^17cm^-2, 0.6x10^15<N(C18O)<4.4x10^16cm^-2,
and 3<X<30 across the whole IRDC. Larger values of X were found towards portions of the cloud related
to the HII regions associated with the N61 and N62 bubbles and with the photodissociation regions
(PDRs), precisely the regions in which FUV photons are strongly interacting with the molecular
gas. Our result represents an observational support to the C18O selectively photodissociation
phenomenon occurring in a quite distant filamentary IRDC. Additionally, based on IR data from the
Hi-GAL survey, the FUV radiation field was estimated in Habing units, and the dust temperature and
N(H2) distribution was studied. Using the average of N(H2), values in close agreement with the canonical
abundance ratios [H2]/[13CO] and [H2]/[C18O] were derived. However, the obtained ranges in the
abundance ratios show that if an accurate analysis of the molecular gas is required, the use of the
canonical values may introduce some bias. Thus, it is important to consider how the gas is irradiated
by the far ultraviolet photons across the molecular cloud. The analysis of X is a good tool to perform
that.
