NGC 2359 is an HII region located in the outer Galaxy that contains the isolated Wolf-Rayet (WR) star
HD 56925. We present millimeter/submillimeter observations of $^{12}$CO($J$ = 1-0, 3-2) line
emission toward the entire nebula. We identified that there are three molecular clouds at VLSR $\sim$37,
$\sim$54, and $\sim$67 km s$^{-1}$, and three HI clouds: two of them are at VLSR $\sim$54 km s$^{-1}$
and the other is at $\sim$63 km s$^{-1}$. These clouds except for the CO cloud at 67 km s$^{-1}$ are
limb-brightened in the radio continuum, suggesting part of each cloud has been ionized. We newly
found an expanding gas motion of CO/HI, whose center and expansion velocities are $\sim$51 and $\sim$4.5
km s$^{-1}$, respectively. This is consistent with large line widths of the CO and HI clouds at 54
km s$^{-1}$. The kinematic temperature of CO clouds at 37 and 54 km s$^{-1}$ are derived to be 17 and
61 K, respectively, whereas that of the CO cloud at 67 km s$^{-1}$ is only 6 K, indicating that the former
two clouds have been heated by strong UV radiation. We concluded that the 37 and 54 km s$^{-1}$ CO clouds
and three HI clouds are associated with NGC 2359, even if these clouds have different velocities.
Although the velocity difference including the expanding motion are typical signatures of the
stellar feedback from the exciting star, our analysis revealed that the observed large momentum
for the 37 km s$^{-1}$ CO cloud cannot be explained only by the total wind momentum of the WR star and
its progenitor. We therefore propose an alternative scenario that the isolated high-mass progenitor
of HD 56925 was formed by a collision between the CO clouds at 37 and 54 km s$^{-1}$. If we apply the collision
scenario, NGC 2359 corresponds to the final phase of the cloud-cloud collision.
