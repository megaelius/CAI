A majority of massive stars are part of binary systems, a large fraction of which will inevitably
interact during their lives. Binary-interaction products (BiPs), i.e. stars affected by such
interaction, are expected to be commonly present in stellar populations. BiPs are thus a crucial
ingredient in the understanding of stellar evolution. We aim to identify and characterize a statistically
significant sample of BiPs by studying clusters of 10-40 Myr, an age at which binary population models
predict the abundance of BiPs to be highest. One example of such a cluster is NGC 330 in the Small Magellanic
Cloud. Using MUSE WFM-AO observations of NGC 330, we resolve the dense cluster core for the first
time and are able to extract spectra of its entire massive star population. We develop an automated
spectral classification scheme based on the equivalent widths of spectral lines in the red part
of the spectrum. We characterize the massive star content of the core of NGC 330 which contains more
than 200 B stars, 2 O stars, 6 A-type supergiants and 11 red supergiants. We find a lower limit on the
Be star fraction of $32 \pm 3\%$ in the whole sample. It increases to at least $46 \pm 10\%$ when only
considering stars brighter than V=17 mag. We estimate an age of the cluster core between 35 and 40
Myr and a total cluster mass of $88^{+17}_{-18} \times 10^3 M_{\odot}$. We find that the population
in the cluster core is different than the population in the outskirts: while the stellar content
in the core appears to be older than the stars in the outskirts, the Be star fraction and the observed
binary fraction are significantly higher. Furthermore, we detect several BiP candidates that
will be subject of future studies.
