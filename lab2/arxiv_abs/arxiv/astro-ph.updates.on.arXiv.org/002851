The question of the origin and evolution of magnetic fields in stars possessing a radiative envelope,
like the A-type stars, is still regarded as a challenge for stellar physics. Those zones are likely
to be differentially rotating, which suggests that strong interactions between differential
rotation and magnetic fields could be at play. We numerically compute the joint evolution of the
magnetic and velocity fields in a 3D spherical shell starting from an initial profile for the poloidal
magnetic field and differential rotation. The poloidal magnetic field is initially wound-up by
the differential rotation to produce a toroidal field which becomes unstable. In the particular
setup studied here where the differential rotation is dominant, the magneto-rotational instability
is triggered. The growth rate of the instability depends mainly on the initial rotation rate, while
the background state typically oscillates over a poloidal Alfv\'en time. We thus find that the axisymmetric
magnetic configuration is strongly modified by the instability only if the ratio between the poloidal
Alfv\'en frequency and the rotation rate is sufficiently small. An enhanced transport of angular
momentum is found in the most unstable cases: the typical time to flatten the rotation profile is
then much faster than the diffusion time scale. We conclude that the magneto-rotational instability
is always favored (over the Tayler instability) in unstratified spherical shells when an initial
poloidal field is sheared by a sufficiently strong cylindrical differential rotation. A possible
application to the magnetic desert observed among A stars is given. We argue that the dichotomy between
stars exhibiting strong axisymmetric fields (Ap stars) and those harboring a sub-Gauss magnetism
could be linked to the threshold for the instability.
