One-dimensional (vertical) models of planetary atmospheres typically balance the net solar and
internal energy fluxes against the net thermal radiative and convective heat fluxes to determine
an equilibrium thermal structure. Thus,simple models of shortwave and long wave radiative transport
can provide insight into key processes operating within planetary atmospheres. Here, we develop
a simple, analytic expression for both the downwelling thermal and net thermal radiative fluxes
in a planetary troposphere. We assume that the atmosphere is non-scattering at thermal wavelengths
and that opacities are grey at these same wavelengths. Additionally, we adopt an atmospheric thermal
structure that follows a modified dry adiabat as well as a physically motivated power law relationship
between grey thermal optical depth and atmospheric pressure. To verify the accuracy of our analytic
treatment, we compare our model to more sophisticated full physics tools as applied to Venus, Earth,
and a cloudfree Jupiter, thereby exploring a diversity of atmospheric conditions conditions.
Next, we seek to better understand our analytic model by exploring how thermal radiative flux profiles
respond to variations in key physical parameters, such as the total grey thermal optical depth of
the atmosphere. Using energy balance arguments, we derive convective flux pro-files for the tropospheres
of all Solar System worlds with thick atmospheres, and propose a scaling that enables inter-comparison
of these profiles. Lastly, we use our analytic treatment to discuss the validity of other simple
models of convective fluxes in planetary atmospheres. Our new expressions build on decades of analytic
modeling exercises in planetary atmospheres, and further prove the utility of simple, generalized
tools in comparative planetology studies.
