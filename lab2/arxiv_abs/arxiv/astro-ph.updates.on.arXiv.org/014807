We present MUSE observations of the gas-rich major-merger BR1202-0725 at z~4.7, which constitutes
one of the most overdense fields known in the early Universe. We utilise these data in conjunction
with existing ALMA observations to compare and contrast the spatially resolved ionised- and cool-gas
content of this system which hosts a quasar (QSO), a sub-millimeter galaxy (SMG), the two known optical
companions ("LAE1", "LAE2"), and an additional companion discovered in this work "LAE3" just 5
arcsec to the North of the QSO. We find that QSO BR1202-0725 exhibits a large Ly$\alpha$ halo, covering
$\approx55$ pkpc on-sky at surface brightness levels of SB$\geq$1E-17 erg/s/cm$^2$/arcsec$^2$.
In contrast, the SMG, of similar far-infrared luminosity and star formation rate (SFR), does not
exhibit such a Ly$\alpha$ halo. The QSO's halo exhibits high velocity widths ($\sim1000$ km/s)
but the gas motion is to some extent kinematically coupled with the previously observed [CII] bridge
between the QSO and the SMG. We note that the object known in the literature as LAE2 shows no local peak
of Ly$\alpha$ emission, rather, its profile is more consistent with being part of the QSO's extended
Ly$\alpha$ halo. The properties of LAE3 are typical of high-redshift LAEs; we measure F$_{\rm{Ly\alpha}}$(LAE3)
= $0.24\pm$0.03E-16 erg/s/cm$^2$, corresponding to SFR$_{\rm{Ly\alpha}}\approx\ $5.0$\pm$0.5
M${_\odot}$/yr. The velocity width is $\Delta v$(LAE3) $\approx 400$ km/s, and equivalent width
EW$_0$(Ly$\alpha_{\,5\sigma}^{\,lim})\geq 34.05$ $\\A$, consistent with star formation being
the primary driver of Ly$\alpha$ emission. We also note a coherent absorption feature at $\sim -400$km/s
in spectra from at least three objects; the QSO, LAE1 and "LAE2" which could imply the presence of
an expanding neutral gas shell with an extent of at least $24$ pkpc.
