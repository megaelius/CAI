We report the spectroscopic confirmation of a new protocluster in the COSMOS field at $z$ $\sim$
2.2, COSMOS Cluster 2.2 (CC2.2), originally identified as an overdensity of narrow-band selected
H$\alpha$ emitting candidates. With only two masks of Keck/MOSFIRE near-IR spectroscopy in both
$H$ ($\sim$ 1.47-1.81 $\mu$m) and $K$ ($\sim$ 1.92-2.40 $\mu$m) bands ($\sim$ 1.5 hour each), we
confirm 35 unique protocluster members with at least two emission lines detected with S/N $>$ 3.
Combined with 12 extra members from the zCOSMOS-deep spectroscopic survey (47 in total), we estimate
a mean redshift and a line-of-sight velocity dispersion of $z_{mean}$=2.23224 $\pm$ 0.00101 and
$\sigma_{los}$=645 $\pm$ 69 km s$^{-1}$ for this protocluster, respectively. Assuming virialization
and spherical symmetry for the system, we estimate a total mass of $M_{vir}$ $\sim$ $(1-2) \times$10$^{14}$
$M_{\odot}$ for the structure. We evaluate a number density enhancement of $\delta_{g}$ $\sim$
7 for this system and we argue that the structure is likely not fully virialized at $z$ $\sim$ 2.2.
However, in a spherical collapse model, $\delta_{g}$ is expected to grow to a linear matter enhancement
of $\sim$ 1.9 by $z$=0, exceeding the collapse threshold of 1.69, and leading to a fully collapsed
and virialized Coma-type structure with a total mass of $M_{dyn}$($z$=0) $\sim$ 9.2$\times$10$^{14}$
$M_{\odot}$ by now. This observationally efficient confirmation suggests that large narrow-band
emission-line galaxy surveys, when combined with ancillary photometric data, can be used to effectively
trace the large-scale structure and protoclusters at a time when they are mostly dominated by star-forming
galaxies.
