We study the properties of two-temperature accretion flow around a non-rotating black hole in presence
of various dissipative processes where pseudo-Newtonian potential is adopted to mimic the effect
of general relativity. The flow encounters energy loss by means of radiative processes acted on
the electrons and at the same time, flow heats up as a consequence of viscous heating effective on
ions. We assumed that the flow is exposed with the stochastic magnetic fields which leads to Synchrotron
emission of electrons and these emissions are further strengthen by Compton scattering. We obtain
the two-temperature global accretion solutions in terms of dissipation parameters, namely, viscosity
($\alpha$) and accretion rate (${\dot m}$), and find for the first time in the literature that such
solutions may contain standing shock waves. Solutions of this kind are multi-transonic in nature
as they simultaneously pass through both inner critical point ($x_{\rm in}$) and outer critical
point ($x_{\rm out}$) before crossing the black hole horizon. We calculate the properties of shock
induced global accretion solutions in terms of the flow parameters. We further show that two-temperature
shocked accretion flow is not a discrete solution, instead such solution exists for wide range of
flow parameters. We identify the effective domain of the parameter space for standing shock and
observe that parameter space shrinks as the dissipation is increased. Since the post-shock region
is hotter due to the effect of shock compression, it naturally emits hard X-rays and therefore, the
two-temperature shocked accretion solution has the potential to explain the spectral properties
of the black hole sources.
