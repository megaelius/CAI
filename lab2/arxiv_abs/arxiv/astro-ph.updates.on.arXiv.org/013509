The Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) is a telescope array that observes the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) over 75% of the sky from the Atacama Desert, Chile, at frequency bands
centered near 40, 90, 150, and 220 GHz. CLASS measures the large angular scale ($1^\circ\lesssim\theta\leqslant
90^\circ$) CMB polarization to constrain the tensor-to-scalar ratio at the $r\sim0.01$ level
and the optical depth to last scattering to the sample variance limit. This paper presents the optical
characterization of the 40 GHz telescope during its first observation era, from 2016 September
to 2018 February. High signal-to-noise observations of the Moon establish the pointing and beam
calibration. The telescope boresight pointing variation is $<0.023^\circ$ ($<1.6$% of the beam's
full width at half maximum (FWHM)). We estimate beam parameters per detector and in aggregate, as
in the CMB survey maps. The aggregate beam has an FWHM of $1.579^\circ\pm.001^\circ$ and a solid
angle of $838 \pm 6\ \mu{\rm sr}$, consistent with physical optics simulations. The corresponding
beam window function has a sub-percent error per multipole at $\ell < 200$. An extended $90^\circ$
beam map reveals no significant far sidelobes. The observed Moon polarization shows that the instrument
polarization angles are consistent with the optical model and that the temperature-to-polarization
leakage fraction is $<10^{-4}$ (95% C.L.). We find that the Moon-based results are consistent with
measurements of M42, RCW 38, and Tau A from CLASS's CMB survey data. In particular, Tau A measurements
establish degree-level precision for instrument polarization angles.
