The VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) ESO Public Survey is opening a new window to study the inner
Galactic globular clusters using their variable stars. These globular clusters have been neglected
in the past due to the difficulties caused by the presence of an elevated extinction and high field
stellar densities in their lines of sight. However, the discovery and study of any present variables
in these clusters, especially RRLyrae stars, can help to greatly improve the accuracy of their physical
parameters. It can also help to shed some light on the interrogations brought by the intriguing Oosterhoff
dichotomy in the Galactic globular cluster system. In a series of papers we plan to explore the variable
stars in the globular clusters falling inside the field of the VVV survey. In this first paper we search
and study the variables present in two highly-reddened, moderately metal-poor, faint, inner Galactic
globular clusters: 2MASS-GC02 and Terzan10. We report the discovery of sizable populations of
RR Lyrae stars in both globular clusters. We use near-infrared period-luminosity relations to
determine the color excess of each RR Lyrae star, from which we obtain both accurate distances to
the globular clusters and the ratios of the selective to total extinction in their directions. We
find the extinction towards both clusters to be elevated, non-standard, and highly differential.
We also find both clusters to be closer to the Galactic center than previously thought, with Terzan10
being on the far side of the Galactic bulge. Finally, we discuss their Oosterhoff properties, and
conclude that both clusters stand out from the dichotomy followed by most Galactic globular clusters.
