A number of extragalactic jets show periodic structures at different scales that can be associated
with growing instabilities. The wavelengths of the developing instability modes and their ratios
depend on the flow parameters, so the study of those structures can shed light on jet physics at the
scales involved. In this work, we use the fits to the jet ridgeline obtained from different observations
of S5 B0836$+$710 and apply stability analysis of relativistic, sheared flows to derive an estimate
of the physical parameters of the jet. Based on the assumption that the observed structures are generated
by growing Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability modes, we have run numerical calculations of stability
of a relativistic, sheared jet over a range of different jet parameters. We have spanned several
orders of magnitude in jet-to-ambient medium density ratio, and jet internal energy, and checked
different values of the Lorentz factor and shear layer width. This represents an independent method
to obtain estimates of the physical parameters of a jet. By comparing the fastest growing wavelengths
of each relevant mode given by the calculations with the observed wavelengths reported in the literature,
we have derived independent estimates of the jet Lorentz factor, specific internal energy, jet-to-ambient
medium density ratio and Mach number. We obtain a jet Lorentz factor $\gamma \simeq 12$, specific
internal energy of $\varepsilon \simeq 10^{-2}\,c^2$, jet-to-ambient medium density ratio of
$\eta\approx 10^{-3}$, and an internal (classical) jet Mach number of $M_\mathrm{j}\approx 12$.
We also find that the wavelength ratios are better recovered by a transversal structure with a width
of $\simeq 10\,\%$ of the jet radius. This method represents a powerful tool to derive the jet parameters
in all jets showing helical patterns with different wavelengths.
