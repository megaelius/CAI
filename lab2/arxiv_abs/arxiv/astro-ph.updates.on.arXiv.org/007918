We present a comprehensive set of spectropolarimetric observations of Earthshine as obtained
by FORS2 at the VLT for phase angles from 50degree to 135degree (Sun-Earth-Moon angle), covering
a spectral range from 430nm to 920nm. The degree of polarization in BVRI passbands, the differential
polarization vegetation index, and the equivalent width of the O2A polarization band around 760nm
are determined with absolute errors around 0.1 percent in the degree of polarization. Earthshine
polarization spectra are corrected for the effect of depolarization introduced by backscattering
on the lunar surface, introducing systematic errors of the order of 1 percent in the degree of polarization.
Distinct viewing sceneries such as observing the Atlantic or Pacific side in Earthshine yield statistically
different phase curves. The equivalent width defined for the O2A band polarization is found to vary
from -5nm to +2nm. A differential polarized vegetation index is introduced and reveals a larger
vegetation signal for those viewing sceneries that contain larger fractions of vegetated surface
areas. We corroborate the observed correlations with theoretical models from the literature,
and conclude that the Vegetation Red Edge(VRE) is a robust and sensitive signature in polarization
spectra of planet Earth. The overall behaviour of polarization of planet Earth in the continuum
and in the O2A band can be explained by existing models. Biosignatures such as the O2A band and the
VRE are detectable in Earthshine polarization with a high degree of significance and sensitivity.
An in-depth understanding of Earthshines temporal and spectral variability requires improved
models of Earths biosphere, as a prerequisite to interpret possible detections of polarised biosignatures
in earthlike exoplanets in the future.
