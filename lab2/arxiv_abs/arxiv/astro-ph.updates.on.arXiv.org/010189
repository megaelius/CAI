Pismis 18 is a moderately populated, intermediate-age open cluster located within the solar circle
at a Galactocentric distance of about 7 kpc. Few open clusters have been studied in detail in the inner
disc region before the Gaia-ESO Survey. New data from the Gaia-ESO Survey allowed us to conduct an
extended radial velocity membership study as well as spectroscopic metallicity and detailed chemical
abundance measurements for this cluster. Gaia-ESO Survey data for 142 potential members, lying
on the upper MS and on the red clump, yielded radial velocity measurements, which, together with
proper motion measurements from the Gaia DR2, were used to determine the systemic velocity of the
cluster and membership of individual stars. Photometry from Gaia DR2 was used to re-determine cluster
parameters based on high confidence member stars only. Cluster abundance measurements of six radial-velocity
member stars with UVES high-resolution spectroscopy are presented for 23 elements. According
to the new estimates, based on high confidence members, Pismis 18 has an age of $700^{+40}_{-50}$
Myr, interstellar reddening of E(B-V) = $0.562^{+0.012}_{-0.026}$ mag and a de-reddened distance
modulus of $DM_0 = 11.96^{+0.10}_{-0.24}$ mag. The median metallicity of the cluster (using the
six UVES stars) is [Fe/H] = $+0.23 \pm 0.05$ dex, with [$\alpha$/Fe]= $0.07 \pm 0.13$ and a slight
enhancement of s- and r- neutron-capture elements. With the present work, we fully characterized
the open cluster Pismis 18, confirming its present location in the inner disc. We estimated a younger
age than the previous literature values and gave, for the first time, its metallicity and its detailed
abundances. Its [$\alpha$/Fe] and [s-process/Fe], both slightly super-solar, are in agreement
with other inner-disc open clusters observed by the Gaia-ESO survey. [abridged]
