Understanding the formation of binary and multiple stellar systems largely comes down to studying
the circumstances for the fragmentation of a condensing core during the first stages of the collapse.
However, the probability of fragmentation and the number of fragments seem to be determined to a
large degree by the initial conditions. In this work we study the fate of the linear perturbations
of a homogeneous gas sphere both analytically and numerically. In particular, we investigate the
stability of the well-known homologous solution that describes the collapse of a uniform spherical
cloud. The difficulty of the mathematical singularity in the perturbation equations is surpassed
here by explicitly introducing a weak shock next to the sonic point. In parallel, we perform adaptive
mesh refinement (AMR) numerical simulations of the linear stages of the collapse and compared the
growth rates obtained by each method. With this combination of analytical and numerical tools,
we explore the behavior of both spherically symmetric and non-axisymmetric perturbations. The
numerical experiments provide the linear growth rates as a function of the core's initial virial
parameter and as a function of the azimuthal wave number of the perturbation. The overlapping regime
of the numerical experiments and the analytical predictions is the situation of a cold and large
cloud, and in this regime the analytically calculated growth rates agree very well with the ones
obtained from the simulations. The use of a weak shock as part of the perturbation allows us to find
a physically acceptable solution to the equations for a continuous range of growth rates. The numerical
simulations agree very well with the analytical prediction for the most unstable cores, while they
impose a limit of a virial parameter of 0.1 for core fragmentation in the absence of rotation.
