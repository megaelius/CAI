Recent observations have revealed the presence of strong CIII] emission (EW$_{\rm{CIII]}}>20$
\r{A}) in $z>6$ galaxies, the origin of which remains unclear. In an effort to understand the nature
of these line emitters, we have initiated a survey targeting CIII] emission in gravitationally-lensed
reionization era analogs identified in HST imaging of clusters from the RELICS survey. Here we report
initial results on four galaxies selected to have low stellar masses (2-8$\times$10$^7$ M$_\odot$)
and J$_{125}$-band flux excesses indicative of intense [OIII]+H$\beta$ emission (EW$_{\rm{[OIII]+H\beta}}$=500-2000
\r{A}), similar to what has been observed at $z>6$. We detect CIII] emission in three of the four sources,
with the CIII] EW reaching values seen in the reionization era (EW$_{\rm{CIII]}}\simeq 17-22$
\r{A}) in the two sources with the strongest optical line emission (EW$_{\rm{[OIII]+H\beta}}\simeq
2000$ \r{A}). We have obtained a Magellan/FIRE near-infrared spectrum of the strongest CIII] emitter
in our sample, revealing gas that is both metal poor and highly ionized. Using photoionization models,
we are able to simultaneously reproduce the intense CIII] and optical line emission for extremely
young (2-3 Myr) and metal poor (0.06-0.08 Z$_\odot$) stellar populations, as would be expected
after a substantial upturn in the SFR of a low mass galaxy. The sources in this survey are among the
first for which CIII] has been used as the primary means of redshift confirmation. We suggest that
it should be possible to extend this approach to $z>6$ with current facilities, using CIII] to measure
redshifts of objects with IRAC excesses indicating EW$_{\rm{[OIII]+H\beta}}\simeq 2000$ \r{A},
providing a method of spectroscopic confirmation independent of Ly$\alpha$.
