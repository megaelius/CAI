Rayleigh scattering in a hydrogen-dominated exoplanet atmosphere can be detected from ground
or space based telescopes, however, stellar activity in the form of spots can mimic Rayleigh scattering
in the observed transmission spectrum. Quantifying this phenomena is key to our correct interpretation
of exoplanet atmospheric properties. We obtained long-slit optical spectroscopy of two transits
of HAT-P-11b with the Optical System for Imaging and low-Intermediate-Resolution Integrated
Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) at Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) on August 30 2016 and September 25 2017.
We integrated the spectrum of HAT-P-11 and one reference star in several spectroscopic channels
across the $\lambda\sim$ 400-785 nm region, creating numerous light curves of the transits. We
fit analytic transit curves to the data taking into account the systematic effects and red noise
present in the time series in an effort to measure the change of the planet-to-star radius ratio ($R_\mathrm{p}/R_\mathrm{s}$)
across wavelength. By fitting both transits together, we find a slope in the transmission spectrum
showing an increase of the planetary radius towards blue wavelengths. A closer inspection to the
transmission spectrum of the individual data sets reveals that the first transit presents this
slope while the transmission spectrum of the second data set is flat. Additionally we detect hints
of Na absorption in the first night, but not in the second. We conclude that the transmission spectrum
slope and Na absorption excess found in the first transit observation are caused by unocculted stellar
spots. Modeling the contribution of unocculted spots to reproduce the results of the first night
we find a spot filling factor of $\delta=0.62^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$ and a spot-to-photosphere temperature
difference of $\Delta T = 429^{+184}_{-299}$ K.
