This work presents the catalogue of optical spectral properties for all X-ray selected SPIDERS
active galactic nuclei (AGN) up to SDSS DR14. SPIDERS (SPectroscopic IDentification of eROSITA
Sources) is an SDSS-IV programme that is currently conducting optical spectroscopy of the counterparts
to the X-ray selected sources detected in the ROSAT all-sky survey and the XMM-Newton slew survey
in the footprint of the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). The SPIDERS
DR14 sample is the largest sample of X-ray selected AGN with optical spectroscopic follow-up to
date. The catalogue presented here is based on a clean sample of 7344 2RXS ($\rm \bar{z}$ = 0.5) and
1157 XMM-Newton slew survey ($\rm \bar{z}$ = 0.4) type 1 AGN with spectroscopic coverage of the H$\rm
\beta$ and/or MgII emission lines. Visual inspection results for each object in this sample are
available from a combination of literature sources and the SPIDERS group, which provide both reliable
redshifts and source classifications. The spectral regions around the H$\rm \beta$ and MgII emission
lines have been fit in order to measure both line and continuum properties, estimate bolometric
luminosities, and provide black hole mass estimates using the single-epoch (or photoionisation)
method. The use of both H$\rm \beta$ and MgII allows black hole masses to be estimated up to z $\rm \simeq$
2.5. A comparison is made between the spectral properties and black hole mass estimates derived
from H$\rm \beta$ and MgII using the subsample of objects which have coverage of both lines in their
spectrum. These results have been made publicly available as an SDSS-IV DR14 value added catalogue.
