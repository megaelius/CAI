Densely packed coronal loops are rooted in plages in the vicinity of active regions on the Sun. The
photospheric magnetic features underlying these plages are patches of mostly unidirectional
magnetic field extending several arcsec on the solar surface. We aim to explore the transient nature
of the magnetic field, its mixed-polarity characteristics, and the associated energetics in plages
using high resolution observations and simulations. We used photospheric Fe I 6173 {\AA} spectropolarimetric
observations of a decaying active region obtained from the SST. These data were inverted to retrieve
the photospheric magnetic field underlying the plage as identified in the EUV emission maps obtained
from the SDO/AIA. To obtain better insight into the evolution of plages, we performed 3D radiation
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetoconvection using the MURaM code. The observations
show transient magnetic flux emergence and cancellation events within the plage on timescales
of a few 100 s and on spatial scales comparable to granules. These transient events occur at the footpoints
of active region plage loops. In one case the coronal response at the footpoints of these loops is
clearly associated with the underlying transient. The simulations also reveal similar magnetic
flux emergence and cancellation events that extend to even smaller spatial and temporal scales.
Individual simulated transient events transfer an energy flux in excess of 1 MW m$^{-2}$ through
the photosphere. We suggest that the magnetic transients could play an important role in the energetics
of active region plage. Both in observations and simulations, the opposite-polarity magnetic
field brought up by transient flux emergence cancels with the surrounding plage field. Magnetic
reconnection associated with such transient events likely conduits magnetic energy to power the
overlying chromosphere and coronal loops.
