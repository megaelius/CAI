Strong lensing time delays can measure the Hubble constant H$_0$ independent of any other probe.
Assuming commonly used forms for the radial mass density profile of the lenses, a 2\% precision has
been achieved with 7 Time-Delay Cosmography (TDCOSMO) lenses, in tension with the H$_0$ from the
cosmic microwave background. However, without assumptions on the radial mass density profile
-- and relying exclusively on stellar kinematics to break the mass-sheet degeneracy -- the precision
drops to 8\% with the current data of the 7 TDCOSMO lenses, insufficient to resolve the H$_0$ tension.
With the addition of external information from 33 Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) lenses, the precision improves
to 5\%, {\it if} the deflectors of TDCOSMO and SLACS lenses are drawn from the same population. We
investigate the prospects to improve the precision of time-delay cosmography without relying
on mass profile assumptions to break the mass sheet degeneracy. Our forecasts are based on the hierarchical
framework introduced by Birrer et al. (2020). With existing samples and technology, 3.3\% precision
on H$_0$ can be reached by adding spatially resolved kinematics of the 7 TDCOSMO lenses. The precision
improves to 2.5\% with the further addition of kinematics for 50 non-time-delay lenses from SLACS
and the Strong Lensing Legacy Survey (SL2S). Expanding the samples to 40 time delay and 200 non-time
delay lenses will improve the precision to 1.5\% and 1.2\%, respectively. Time-delay cosmography
can reach sufficient precision to resolve the Hubble tension at 3-5$\sigma$, without assumptions
on the radial mass profile of lens galaxies. By obtaining this precision with and without external
datasets, we will test the consistency of the samples and enable further improvements based on even
larger future samples of time delay and non-time-delay lenses (e.g. from the Rubin, Euclid, and
Roman Observatories).
