We report the results of our follow-up campaign of the peculiar supernova ASASSN-15no, based on
optical data covering ~300 days of its evolution. Initially the spectra show a pure blackbody continuum.
After few days, the HeI 5876 A transition appears with a P-Cygni profile and an expansion velocity
of about 8700 km/s. Fifty days after maximum, the spectrum shows signs typically seen in interacting
supernovae. A broad (FWHM~8000 km/s) Halpha becomes more prominent with time until ~150 days after
maximum and quickly declines later on. At these phases Halpha starts to show an intermediate component,
which together with the blue pseudo-continuum are clues that the ejecta begin to interact with the
CSM. The spectra at the latest phases look very similar to the nebular spectra of stripped-envelope
SNe. The early part (the first 40 days after maximum) of the bolometric curve, which peaks at a luminosity
intermediate between normal and superluminous supernovae, is well reproduced by a model in which
the energy budget is essentially coming from ejecta recombination and 56Ni decay. From the model
we infer a mass of the ejecta Mej = 2.6 Msun; an initial radius of the photosphere R0 = 2.1 x 10^14 cm;
and an explosion energy Eexpl = 0.8 x 10^51 erg. A possible scenario involves a massive and extended
H-poor shell lost by the progenitor star a few years before explosion. The shell is hit, heated and
accelerated by the supernova ejecta. The accelerated shell+ejecta rapidly dilutes, unveiling
the unperturbed supernova spectrum below. The outer ejecta start to interact with a H-poor external
CSM lost by the progenitor system about 9 -- 90 years before the explosion.
