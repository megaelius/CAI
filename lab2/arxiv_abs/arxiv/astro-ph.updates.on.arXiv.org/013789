The second Gaia data release (Gaia DR2) provided us with the precise five-parameter astrometry
for 1.3 billion of sources. As stars passing close to the Solar System are thought to be responsible
for influencing the dynamical history of long period comets, we update and extend the list of stars
that could potentially perturb motion of these comets. We aim to announce a publicly available database
containing an up to date list of stars and stellar systems potentially perturbing long period comets
motion. We add new objects and revise previously published lists. Special emphasis was placed on
stellar systems. Discussion on masses estimation is included. Using the astrometry, preferably
from Gaia DR2, augmented with data from other sources, we calculate spatial positions and velocities
for each star. To filter studied objects on the basis of their minimal heliocentric distances we
numerically integrate motion of stars under the Galactic potential and their mutual interactions.
We announce the updated list of stellar perturbers of cometary motion, including masses of perturbers
along with the publicly available database interface. These data are ready to be used with the observed
long period comets orbits to study an individual influence of a whole sample of perturbers, or specific
stars, on a dynamical past or future of a specific comet. 147 new perturbers were added in comparison
to the previously published sources. We demonstrate that a new set of potential perturbers constitute
an important tool in studies of cometary dynamics. The usage of our data significantly changes results
of the past and future comet motion analysis. We point out a puzzling object in our list, star ALS 9243.
The Gaia DR2 astrometry suggests a very close encounter of this star with the Sun however, its astrophysical
parameters result in a completely different current distance of ALS 9243 and its large mass.
