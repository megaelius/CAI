We present the first results from RomulusC, the highest resolution cosmological hydrodynamic
simulation of a galaxy cluster run to date. RomulusC, a zoom-in simulation of a halo with $z=0$ mass
$10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$, is run with the same sub-grid physics and resolution as Romulus25 (Tremmel
et al. 2017). With unprecedented mass and spatial resolution, RomulusC represents a unique opportunity
to study the evolution of galaxies in dense environments down to dwarf masses. We demonstrate that
RomulusC results in an intracluster medium (ICM) consistent with observations. The star formation
history and stellar mass of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) is consistent with observations
and abundance matching results, indicating that our sub-grid models, optimized only to reproduce
observations of field dwarf and Milky Way mass galaxies, are able to produce reasonable galaxy masses
and star formation histories in much higher mass systems. Feedback from supermassive black holes
(SMBHs) regulates star formation by driving large-scale, collimated outflows that coexist with
a low entropy core. We find that non-BCG cluster member galaxies are substantially quenched compared
to the field down to dwarf galaxy masses and, at low masses, quenching is seen to have no dependence
on mass or distance from the cluster center. This enhanced quenched population extends beyond $R_{200}$
and is in place at high redshift. Similarly, we predict that SMBH activity is significantly suppressed
within clusters outside of the BCG, but show how the effect could be lost when only focusing on the
brightest AGN in the most massive galaxies.
