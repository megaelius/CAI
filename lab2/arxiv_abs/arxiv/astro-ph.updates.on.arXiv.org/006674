Does overall thermal equilibrium exist between ions and electrons in a weakly collisional, magnetised,
turbulent plasma---and, if not, how is thermal energy partitioned between ions and electrons?
This is a fundamental question in plasma physics, the answer to which is also crucial for predicting
the properties of far-distant astronomical objects such as accretion discs around black holes.
In the context of discs, this question was posed nearly two decades ago and has since generated a sizeable
literature. Here we provide the answer for the case in which energy is injected into the plasma via
Alfv\'enic turbulence: collisionless turbulent heating typically acts to disequilibrate the
ion and electron temperatures. Numerical simulations using a hybrid fluid-gyrokinetic model
indicate that the ion-electron heating-rate ratio is an increasing function of the thermal-to-magnetic
energy ratio, $\beta_\mathrm{i}$: it ranges from $\sim0.05$ at $\beta_\mathrm{i}=0.1$ to at
least $30$ for $\beta_\mathrm{i} \gtrsim 10$. This energy partition is approximately insensitive
to the ion-to-electron temperature ratio $T_\mathrm{i}/T_\mathrm{e}$. Thus, in the absence
of other equilibrating mechanisms, a collisionless plasma system heated via Alfv\'enic turbulence
will tend towards a nonequilibrium state in which one of the species is significantly hotter than
the other, viz., hotter ions at high $\beta_\mathrm{i}$, hotter electrons at low $\beta_\mathrm{i}$.
Spectra of electromagnetic fields and the ion distribution function in 5D phase space exhibit an
interesting new magnetically dominated regime at high $\beta_i$ and a tendency for the ion heating
to be mediated by nonlinear phase mixing (``entropy cascade'') when $\beta_\mathrm{i}\lesssim1$
and by linear phase mixing (Landau damping) when $\beta_\mathrm{i}\gg1$
