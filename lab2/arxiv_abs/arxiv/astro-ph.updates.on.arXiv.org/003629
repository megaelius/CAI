The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) began observations in July 2014.
It pursues three core programs: APOGEE-2, MaNGA, and eBOSS. In addition, eBOSS contains two major
subprograms: TDSS and SPIDERS. This paper describes the first data release from SDSS-IV, Data Release
13 (DR13), which contains new data, reanalysis of existing data sets and, like all SDSS data releases,
is inclusive of previously released data. DR13 makes publicly available 1390 spatially resolved
integral field unit observations of nearby galaxies from MaNGA, the first data released from this
survey. It includes new observations from eBOSS, completing SEQUELS. In addition to targeting
galaxies and quasars, SEQUELS also targeted variability-selected objects from TDSS and X-ray
selected objects from SPIDERS. DR13 includes new reductions of the SDSS-III BOSS data, improving
the spectrophotometric calibration and redshift classification. DR13 releases new reductions
of the APOGEE-1 data from SDSS-III, with abundances of elements not previously included and improved
stellar parameters for dwarf stars and cooler stars. For the SDSS imaging data, DR13 provides new,
more robust and precise photometric calibrations. Several value-added catalogs are being released
in tandem with DR13, in particular target catalogs relevant for eBOSS, TDSS, and SPIDERS, and an
updated red-clump catalog for APOGEE. This paper describes the location and format of the data now
publicly available, as well as providing references to the important technical papers that describe
the targeting, observing, and data reduction. The SDSS website, this http URL, provides links to
the data, tutorials and examples of data access, and extensive documentation of the reduction and
analysis procedures. DR13 is the first of a scheduled set that will contain new data and analyses
from the planned ~6-year operations of SDSS-IV.
