The intermediate polar FO Aquarii (FO Aqr) experienced its first-reported low-accretion states
in 2016, 2017, and 2018, and using newly available photographic plates, we identify pre-discovery
low states in 1965, 1966, and 1974. The primary focus of our analysis, however, is an extensive set
of time-series photometry obtained between 2002 and 2018, with particularly intensive coverage
of the 2016-2018 low states. After computing an updated spin ephemeris for the white dwarf (WD),
we show that its spin period began to increase in 2014 after having spent 27 years decreasing; no other
intermediate polar has experienced a sign change of its period derivative, but FO Aqr has now done
so twice. Our central finding is that the recent low states all occurred shortly after the WD began
to spin down, even though no low states were reported in the preceding quarter-century, when it was
spinning up. Additionally, the system's mode of accretion is extremely sensitive to the mass-transfer
rate, with accretion being almost exclusively disk-fed when FO Aqr is brighter than V~14 and substantially
stream-fed when it is not. Even in the low states, a grazing eclipse remains detectable, confirming
the presence of a disk-like structure (but not necessarily a Keplerian accretion disk). We relate
these various observations to theoretical predictions that during the low state, the system's
accretion disk dissipates into a non-Keplerian ring of diamagnetic blobs. Finally, a new XMM-Newton
observation from a high state in 2017 reveals an anomalously soft X-ray spectrum and diminished
X-ray luminosity compared to pre-2016 observations.
