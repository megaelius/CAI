We derive new constraints on the mass, rotation, orbit structure and statistical parallax of the
Galactic old nuclear star cluster and the mass of the supermassive black hole. We combine star counts
and kinematic data from Fritz et al (2014), including 2'500 line-of-sight velocities and 10'000
proper motions. We show that the difference between the proper motion dispersions sigma_l and sigma_b
cannot be explained by rotation, but is a consequence of the flattening of the nuclear cluster. We
fit the surface density distribution of stars in the central 1000'' by a spheroidal cluster with
scale ~100'' and a much larger nuclear disk component. We compute the two-integral distribution
function f(E,L_z) for this density model, and add rotation self-consistently. We find that: (i)
The orbit structure of the f(E,L_z) gives an excellent match to the observed velocity dispersion
profiles as well as the proper motion and line-of-sight velocity histograms, including the double-peak
in the v_l-histograms. (ii) This requires an axial ratio of 1/q= 1.35 for r<70''. (iii) The nuclear
star cluster is approximately described by an isotropic rotator model. (iv) Using the corresponding
Jeans equations to fit the proper motion and line-of-sight velocity dispersions, we obtain best
estimates for the nuclear star cluster mass, black hole mass, and distance M_*(r<100'')=(9.26+-0.31|_stat+-0.9|_syst)x10^6M_sun,
M_bh=(3.88+-0.14|_stat+-0.4|_syst)x10^6M_sun, and R_0=8.30+-0.09|_stat}+-0.1|_syst kpc,
where the systematic errors estimate additional uncertainties in the dynamical modeling. (v)
The combination of the cluster dynamics with the S-star orbits around Sgr A* strongly reduces the
degeneracy between black hole mass and Galactic centre distance present in previous S-star studies.
A joint statistical analysis with the results of Gillessen et al (2009) gives M_bh=4.26+-0.14)x10^6M_sun
and R_0=8.36+-0.11 kpc.
