We use a joint optical/X-ray analysis to constrain the geometry and history of the ongoing merging
event in the massive galaxy cluster MACSJ0416.1-2403 (z=0.397). Our investigation of cluster
substructure rests primarily on a strong- and weak-lensing mass reconstruction based on the deep,
high-resolution images obtained for the Hubble Frontier Fields initiative. To reveal the system's
dynamics, we complement this lensing analysis with a study of the intra-cluster gas using shallow
Chandra data, and a three-dimensional model of the distribution and motions of cluster galaxies
derived from over 100 spectroscopic redshifts. The multi-scale grid model obtained from our combined
weak- and strong-lensing analysis provides a high-precision mass reconstruction to cluster-centric
distances of almost 1 Mpc. Our analysis detects the two well known mass concentrations near the centre
of the field. A pronounced offset between collisional and collisionless matter is only observed
for the SW cluster component, while excellent alignment is found for the NE cluster. Both the lensing
analysis and the distribution of cluster light strongly suggest the presence of a third massive
structure, almost 2 arcmin SW of the cluster centre. As no X-ray emission is detected in this region,
one hypothesis is that this structure is non-virialized and possibly part of an attached large-scale
filament that would then be almost aligned with our line of sight. Combining all evidence from the
distribution of dark and luminous matter, we propose that MACSJ0416.1-2403 is in the early stages
of a merger that features a significant impact parameter and is proceeding along an axis that is highly
inclined with respect to the plane of the sky. Upcoming deep X-ray observations that allow the detection
of shock fronts, cold cores, and sloshing gas will allow us to test this merger scenario.
