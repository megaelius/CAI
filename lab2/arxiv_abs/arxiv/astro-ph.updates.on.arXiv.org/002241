We investigate the sensitivity of the measured broad emission-line responsivity dlog f_line/dlog
f_cont to continuum variations in the context of straw-man BLR geometries of varying size with fixed
BLR boundaries, and for which the intrinsic emission-line responsivity is known a priori. We find
for a generic emission-line that the measured responsivity, delay and maximum of the cross-correlation
function are correlated for characteristic continuum variability timescales T_char less than
the maximum delay for that line tau_max(line) for a particular choice of BLR geometry and observer
orientation. The above correlations are manifestations of geometric dilution arising from reverberation
effects within the spatially extended BLR. When present, geometric dilution reduces the measured
responsivity, delay and maximum of the cross-correlation function. We also find that the measured
responsivity and delay show a strong dependence on light-curve duration, with shorter campaigns
resulting in smaller than expected values, and only a weak dependence on sampling rate. The observed
strong negative correlation between continuum level and line responsivity found in previous studies
cannot be explained by differences in the sampling pattern, light-curve duration or in terms of
purely geometrical effects. To explain this and to satisfy the observed positive correlation between
continuum luminosity and BLR size in an individual source, the responsivity-weighted radius must
increase with increasing continuum luminosity. For a BLR with fixed inner and outer boundaries
this requires radial surface emissivity distributions which deviate significantly from a simple
power-law, and in such a way that the intrinsic emission-line responsivity increases toward larger
BLR radii, in line with photoionisation calculations.
