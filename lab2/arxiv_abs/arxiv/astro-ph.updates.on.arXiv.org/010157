We present the study of a magnitude limited sample (mB < 16.6 mag) of 13 late type galaxies (LTGs),
observed inside the virial radius, Rvir 0.7 Mpc, of the Fornax cluster within the Fornax Deep Survey
(FDS). The main objective is to use surface brightness (SB) profiles and g-i colour maps to obtain
information on the internal structure of these galaxies and find signatures of the mechanisms that
drive their evolution in high-density environment, which is inside the virial radius of the cluster.
By modelling galaxy isophotes, we extract the azimuthally averaged surface brightness profiles
in four optical bands. We also derive g-i colour profiles, and structural parameters like total
magnitude and effective radius. For 10 of the galaxies in this sample, we observe a clear discontinuity
in their SB profiles, derive their break radius (Br), and classify their disc-breaks into Type-II
(down-bending) or Type-III (up-bending). We find that Type-II galaxies have bluer average (g-i)
colour in their outer discs while Type-III galaxies are redder. Br increases with stellar mass and
molecular gas mass while decreases with molecular gas-fractions. The inner and outer scale-lengths
increase monotonically with absolute magnitude, as found in other works. In Fornax, galaxies with
morphological type 5< T< 9 (~60 % of the sample) are located beyond the high-density, ETG-dominated
regions, but no correlation found between T and the disc-break type. The main results of this work
suggest that the disc-breaks of LTGs inside the virial radius of the Fornax cluster seem to have arisen
through a variety of mechanisms, which is evident in their outer-disc colours and the absence of
molecular gas beyond their break radius in some cases. This can result in a variety of stellar populations
inside and outside the break radii.
