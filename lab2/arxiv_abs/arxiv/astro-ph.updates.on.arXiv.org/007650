We show that a number of claims made in Myhrvold (2018) (hereafter M2018b) regarding the WISE data
and thermal modeling of asteroids are incorrect. That paper provides thermal fit parameter outputs
for only two of the about 150,000 object dataset and does not make a direct comparison to asteroids
with diameters measured by other means to assess the quality of that work's thermal model. We are
unable to reproduce the results for the two objects for which M2018b published its own thermal fit
outputs, including diameter, albedo, beaming, and infrared albedo. In particular, the infrared
albedos published in M2018b are unphysically low. [...] While there were some minor issues with
consistency between tables due to clerical errors in the WISE/NEOWISE team's various papers and
data release in the Planetary Data System, and a software issue that slightly increased diameter
uncertainties in some cases, these issues do not substantially change the results and conclusions
drawn from the data. We have shown in previous work and with updated analyses presented here that
the effective spherical diameters for asteroids published to date are accurate to within the previously
quoted minimum systematic 1-sigma uncertainty of about 10 percent when data of appropriate quality
and quantity are available. Moreover, we show that the method used by M2018b to compare diameters
between various asteroid datasets is incorrect and overestimates their differences. In addition,
among other misconceptions in M2018b, we show that the WISE photometric measurement uncertainties
are appropriately characterized and used by the WISE data processing pipeline and NEOWISE thermal
modeling software. We show that the Near-Earth Asteroid Thermal Model (Harris 1998) employed by
the NEOWISE team is a very useful model for analyzing infrared data to derive diameters and albedos
when used properly.
