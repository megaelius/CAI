We present the comprehensive analyses of faint dropout galaxies up to $z\sim 10$ with the first full-depth
data set of Abell 2744 lensing cluster and parallel fields completed by the Hubble Frontier Fields
(HFF) program in July 2014. We identify $54$ dropouts at $z \sim 5-10$ in the HFF fields, and strikingly
enlarge the size of $z\sim 9$ galaxy sample obtained to date. Although the number of highly magnified
($\mu \sim 10$) galaxies is small due to the tiny survey volume of strong lensing, our study reaches
the galaxies' intrinsic luminosities comparable to the deepest-field HUDF studies. We derive
UV luminosity functions with these faint dropouts, carefully evaluating the combination of observational
incompleteness and lensing effects in the image plane by intensive simulations including magnification,
distortion, and multiplication of images, with the evaluations of mass model dependences. Our
results confirm that the faint-end slope, $\alpha$, is as steep as $-2$ at $z \sim 6-8$, and significantly
strengthen the evidence of the rapid decrease of UV luminosity densities, $\rho_{\rm UV}$, at $z>8$
from the large $z\sim 9$ sample. We examine whether the rapid $\rho_{\rm UV}$ decrease trend can
reconcile with the large Thomson scattering optical depth, $\tau_{\rm e}$, measured by CMB experiments
based on the ionization equation calculations allowing a large space of free parameters such as
average ionizing photon escape fraction and stellar-population dependent conversion factor.
No parameter set can reproduce both the rapid $\rho_{\rm UV}$ decrease and the large $\tau_{\rm
e}$. It is possible that the $\rho_{\rm UV}$ decrease moderates at $z\gtrsim 11$, that the free parameters
significantly evolve towards high-$z$, or that there exist additional sources of reionization
such as X-ray binaries and faint AGNs.
