The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey (MaDCoWS) provides a catalogue of high-redshift
($0.7\lesssim z\lesssim 1.5$) infrared-selected galaxy clusters. However, the verification
of the ionised intracluster medium, indicative of a collapsed and nearly virialised system, is
made challenging by the high redshifts of the sample members. The main goal of this work is to test
the capabilities of the Atacama Compact (Morita) Array (ACA) Band 3 observations, centred about
97.5 GHz, to provide robust validation of cluster detections via the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich
effect. Using a pilot sample that comprises ten MaDCoWS galaxy clusters, accessible to ACA and representative
of the median sample richness, we infer the masses of the selected galaxy clusters and respective
detection significance by means of a Bayesian analysis of the interferometric data. Our test of
the "Verification with the ACA - Localisation and Cluster Analysis" (VACA LoCA) programme demonstrates
that the ACA can robustly confirm the presence of the virialised intracluster medium in galaxy clusters
previously identified in full-sky surveys. In particular, we obtained a significant detection
of the SZ effect for seven out of the ten VACA LoCA clusters. We note that this result is independent
of the assumed pressure profile. However, the limited angular dynamic range of the ACA in Band 3 alone,
short observational integration times, and possible contamination from unresolved sources limit
the detailed characterisation of the cluster properties and the inference of the cluster masses
within scales appropriate for the robust calibration of mass-richness scaling relations.
