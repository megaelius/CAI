IUCAA Digital Sampling Array Controller (IDSAC) is a generic CCD Controller which is flexible and
powerful enough to control a wide variety of CCDs and CMOS detectors used for ground-based astronomy.
It has a fully scalable architecture, which can control multiple CCDs and can be easily expanded.
The controller has a modular backplane architecture consists of Single Board Controller Cards
(SBCs) and can control a mosaic or independent of 5 CCDs. Key features of IDSAC contains usage of FPGA
as a reconfigurable master controller, implementation of Digital CDS to achieve low noise and ability
to process upto four CCD output at 1Mpixels/Sec/Channel with 16-bit resolution. The best feature
of IDSAC is it uses the technique of Digital Correlated Double Sampling(DCDS). It is known that CCD
video output is dominated by thermal KTC noise contributed from the summing well capacitor of the
CCD output circuitry. To eliminate thermal KTC noise Correlated Double Sampling (CDS) is a very
standard technique. CDS performed in Digital domain (DCDS) has several advantages over its analog
counterpart, such as - less electronics, faster readout and easier post processing. It is also flexible
with sampling rate and pixel throughput while maintaining the core circuit topology intact. The
noise characterization of the IDSAC CDS signal chain has been performed by analytical modelling,
software simulation and practical measurements. Various types of noise such as white, pink, power
supply, bias etc. has been considered while creating a analytical noise model tool to predict noise
of a controller system like IDSAC. Standard test bench softwares like Pspice and Multisim are used
to simulate the noise performance while several tests are performed to measure the actual noise
of IDSAC.The theoretical calculation matches very well with component level simulation as well
as practical measurements within 10% accuracy.
