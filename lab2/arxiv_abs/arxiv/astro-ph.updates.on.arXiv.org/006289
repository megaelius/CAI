Among the eruptive activity phenomena observed on the Sun, the most technology threatening ones
are flares with associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar energetic particles (SEPs).
Flares with associated CMEs and SEPs are produced by magnetohydrodynamical processes in magnetically
active regions (ARs) on the Sun. However, these ARs do not only produce flares with associated CMEs
and SEPs, they also lead to flares and CMEs, which are not associated with any other event. In an attempt
to distinguish flares with associated CMEs and SEPs from flares and CMEs, which are unassociated
with any other event, we investigate the performances of two machine learning algorithms. To achieve
this objective, we employ support vector machines (SVMs) and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) using
data from the Space Weather Database of Notification, Knowledge, Information (DONKI) of NASA Space
Weather Center, {\it the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite} ({\it GOES}), and
the Space-Weather Heliospheric and Magnetic Imager Active Region Patches (SHARPs). We show that
True Skill Statistics (TSS) and Heidke Skill Scores (HSS) calculated for SVMs are slightly better
than those from the MLPs. We also show that the forecasting time frame of 96 hours provides the best
results in predicting if a flare will be associated with CMEs and SEPs (TSS=0.92$\pm$0.09 and HSS=0.92$\pm$0.08).
Additionally, we obtain the maximum TSS and HSS values of 0.91$\pm$0.06 for predicting that a flare
will not be associated with CMEs and SEPs for the 36 hour forecast window, while the 108 hour forecast
window give the maximum TSS and HSS values for predicting CMEs will not be accompanying any events
(TSS=HSS=0.98$\pm$0.02).
