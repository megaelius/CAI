Here we study the potential observational signatures of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs)
in the Fe K$\alpha$ line profiles emitted from the accretion disks around their components. We simulated
the Fe K$\alpha$ line emission from the relativistic accretion disks using ray tracing method in
Kerr metric. The obtained profiles from the SMBHBs are then compared with those in the case of the
single supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We considered two models of the SMBHBs: a model when the
secondary SMBH is embedded in the accretion disk around the primary, causing an empty gap in the disk,
and a model with clearly separated components, where the accretion disks around both primary and
secondary give a significant contribution to the composite Fe K$\alpha$ line emission of a such
SMBHB. The obtained results showed that both models of SMBHBs can leave imprints in the form of ripples
in the cores of the emitted Fe K$\alpha$ line profiles, which may look like an absorption component
in the line profile. However, in the case of the composite line profiles emitted from two accretion
disks, these ripples could have much higher amplitudes and strongly depend on orbital phase of the
system, while for those emitted from a disk with an empty gap, the corresponding ripples mostly have
lower amplitudes and do not vary significantly with orbital phase. The present day X-ray telescopes
are not able to detect such signatures in the observed X-ray spectra of SMBHBs. However this will
be possible with the next generation of X-ray observatories, which will also enable application
of such effects as a tool for studying the properties of these objects.
