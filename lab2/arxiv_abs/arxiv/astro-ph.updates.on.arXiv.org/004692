Massive young stellar objects in the Magellanic Clouds show infrared absorption features corresponding
to significant abundances of CO, CO$_2$ and H$_2$O ice along the line of sight, with the relative
abundances of these ices differing between the Magellanic Clouds and the Milky Way. CO ice is not
detected towards sources in the Small Magellanic Cloud, and upper limits put its relative abundance
well below sources in the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Milky Way. We use our gas-grain chemical
code MAGICKAL, with multiple grain sizes and grain temperatures, and further expand it with a treatment
for increased interstellar radiation field intensity to model the elevated dust temperatures
observed in the MCs. We also adjust the elemental abundances used in the chemical models, guided
by observations of HII regions in these metal-poor satellite galaxies. With a grid of models, we
are able to reproduce the relative ice fractions observed in MC massive young stellar objects (MYSOs),
indicating that metal depletion and elevated grain temperature are important drivers of the MYSO
envelope ice composition. Magellanic Cloud elemental abundances have a sub-galactic C/O ratio,
increasing H$_2$O ice abundances relative to the other ices; elevated grain temperatures favor
CO$_2$ production over H$_2$O and CO. The observed shortfall in CO in the Small Magellanic Cloud
can be explained by a combination of reduced carbon abundance and increased grain temperatures.
The models indicate that a large variation in radiation field strength is required to match the range
of observed LMC abundances. CH$_3$OH abundance is found to be enhanced in low-metallicity models,
providing seed material for complex organic molecule formation in the Magellanic Clouds.
