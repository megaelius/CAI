We present an analysis of the gas dynamics of star-forming galaxies at z~1.5 using data from the KMOS
Galaxy Evolution Survey (KGES). We quantify the morphology of the galaxies using $HST$ CANDELS
imaging parametrically and non-parametrically. We combine the H$\alpha$ dynamics from KMOS with
the high-resolution imaging to derive the relation between stellar mass (M$_{*}$) and stellar
specific angular momentum (j$_{*}$). We show that high-redshift star-forming galaxies at z~1.5
follow a power-law trend in specific stellar angular momentum with stellar mass similar to that
of local late-type galaxies of the form j$_*$$\propto$M$_*^{0.53 \pm 0.10}$. The highest specific
angular momentum galaxies are mostly disc-like, although generally, both peculiar morphologies
and disc-like systems are found across the sequence of specific angular momentum at a fixed stellar
mass. We explore the scatter within the j$_{*}$-M$_{*}$ plane and its correlation with both the
integrated dynamical properties of a galaxy (e.g. velocity dispersion, Toomre Q$_{\rm g}$, H$\alpha$
star formation rate surface density $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) and its parameterised rest-frame UV/optical
morphology (e.g. S\'ersic index, bulge to total ratio, Clumpiness, Asymmetry and Concentration).
We establish that the position in the j$_{*}$-M$_{*}$ plane is strongly correlated with the star-formation
surface density and the Clumpiness of the stellar light distribution. Galaxies with peculiar rest-frame
UV/optical morphologies have comparable specific angular momentum to disc-dominated galaxies
of the same stellar mass, but are clumpier and have higher star-formation rate surface densities.
We propose that the peculiar morphologies in high--redshift systems are driven by higher star formation
rate surface densities and higher gas fractions leading to a more clumpy inter-stellar medium.
