Many asteroid databases with lightcurve brightness measurements (e.g. WISE, Pan-STARRS1) contain
enormous amounts of data for asteroid shape and spin modelling. While lightcurve inversion is not
plausible for individual targets with scarce data, it is possible for large populations with thousands
of asteroids, where the distributions of the shape and spin characteristics of the populations
are obtainable. We aim to introduce a software implementation of a method that computes the joint
shape elongation p and spin latitude beta distributions for a population, with the brightness observations
given in an asteroid database. Other main goals are to include a method for performing validity checks
of the algorithm, and a tool for a statistical comparison of populations. The LEADER software package
read the brightness measurement data for a user-defined subpopulation from a given database. The
observations were used to compute estimates of the brightness variations of the population members.
A cumulative distribution function (CDF) was constructed of these estimates. A superposition
of known analytical basis functions yielded this CDF as a function of the (shape, spin) distribution.
The joint distribution can be reconstructed by solving a linear constrained inverse problem. To
test the validity of the method, the algorithm can be run with synthetic asteroid models, where the
shape and spin characteristics are known, and by using the geometries taken from the examined database.
LEADER is a fast and robust software package for solving shape and spin distributions for large populations.
There are major differences in the quality and coverage of measurements depending on the database
used, so synthetic simulations are always necessary before a database can be reliably used. We show
examples of differences in the results when switching to another database.
