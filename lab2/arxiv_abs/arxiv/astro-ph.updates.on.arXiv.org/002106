Ultraluminous and luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs and LIRGs) are the most extreme star-forming
galaxies in the universe, and dominate the total star formation rate density at z>1. In the local
universe (z<0.3), the majority of ULIRGs and a significant portion of LIRGs are triggered by
interactions between gas-rich spiral galaxies, yet it is unclear if this is still the case at high-z.
To investigate the relative importance of galaxy interactions in infrared luminous galaxies,
we carry out a comparison of optical morphological properties between local (U)LIRGs and (U)LIRGs
at z=0.5-1.5 based on the same sample selection, morphology classification scheme, and optical
morphology at similar rest-frame wavelengths. In addition, we quantify the systematics in comparing
local and high-z datasets by constructing a redshifted dataset from local (U)LIRGs, in which its
data quality mimics the high-z dataset. Based on the Gini-M20 classification scheme, we find that
the fraction of interacting systems decreases by ~8% from local to z<~1, and it is consistent
with the reduction between local and redshifted datasets (6(+14-6)%). Based on visual classifications,
the merger fraction of local ULIRGs is found to be ~20% lower compared to published results, and the
reduction due to redshifiting is 15(+10-8)%. Consequently, the differences of merger fractions
between local and z<~1 (U)LIRGs is only ~17%. These results demonstrate that there is no strong
evolution in the fraction of (U)LIRGs classified as mergers at least out to z~1. At z>1, the morphology
types of ~30% of (U)LIRGs can not be determined due to their faintness in the F814W-band, and thus
the merger fraction measured at z>1 suffers from large uncertainties.
