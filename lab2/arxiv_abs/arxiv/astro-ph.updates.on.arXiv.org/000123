We present near-infrared and optical observations of moderately fast FeII-class Nova Scuti 2009
(V496 Sct) covering various phases; pre-maximum, early decline and nebular, during the first 10
months after its discovery followed by limited observations up to 2011 April. In the initial phase
the nova spectra show prominent P Cygni profiles and later all the lines are seen in emission. The
notable feature of the near-IR spec- tra in the early decline phase is the rare presence of the first
overtone bands of carbon monoxide (CO) in emission. The IR spectra show clear dust formation in the
expand- ing ejecta at later phase about 150 days after the peak brightness. The presence of lines
of elements with low ionization potentials like Na and Mg in the early IR spectra and the detection
of CO bands in emission and the dust formation in V496 Sct represents a complete expected sequence
in the dust formation in nova ejecta. The light curve shows a slow rise to the maximum and a slow decline
indicating a prolonged mass loss. This is corroborated by the strengthening of P Cygni profiles
during the first 30 days. The broad and single absorption components seen in many lines in the optical
spectra at the time of discovery are replaced by two sharper components in the spectra taken close
to the optical maximum brightness. These sharp dips seen in the P Cygni absorption components of
Fe II and H I lines during the early decline phase show increasing outflow velocities. The onset of
the nebular phase is evident from the optical spectra in 2010 March. During the nebular phase, several
emission lines display saddle-like profiles. In the nebular stage, the observed fluxes of [O III]
and H lines are used to estimate the electron number densities and the mass of the ejecta. The optical
spectra show that the nova is evolved in the P_fe A_o spectral sequence.
