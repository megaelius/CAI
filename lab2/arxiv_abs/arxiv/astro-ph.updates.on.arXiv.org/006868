We present a combined, homogenized analysis of archival Submillimeter Array (SMA) and Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the spatially resolved 340 GHz (870
$\mu$m) continuum emission from 105 nearby protoplanetary disks. Building on the previous SMA
survey, we infer surface brightness profiles using a simple model of the observed visibilities
to derive the luminosities ($L_{\rm mm}$) and effective sizes ($R_{\rm eff}$) of the continuum
emission. With this sample, we confirm the shapes, normalizations, and dispersions for the strong
correlations between $L_{\rm mm}$, $M_\ast$ (or $L_\ast$), and $\dot{M}_\ast$ found in previous
studies. We also verify the continuum size--luminosity relation determined from the SMA survey
alone (extending to an order of magnitude lower $L_{\rm mm}$), demonstrating that the amount of
emission scales linearly with the emitting surface area. Moreover, we identify new, although weaker,
relationships between $R_{\rm eff}$ and the host and accretion properties, such that disks are
larger around more massive hosts with higher accretion rates. We explore these inter-related demographic
properties with some highly simplified approximations. These multi-dimensional relationships
can be explained if the emission is optically thick with a filling factor of $\sim$0.3, or if the emission
is optically thin and disks have roughly the same optical depth profile shapes and normalizations
independent of host properties. In both scenarios, we require the dust disk sizes to have a slightly
sub-linear relationship with the host mass and a non-negligible dispersion ($\sim$0.2 dex at a
given $M_\ast$).
