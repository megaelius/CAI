We aim at studying the causal link between the knotty jet structure in CARMA 7, a young Class 0 protostar
in the Serpens South cluster, and episodic accretion in young protostellar disks. We used numerical
hydrodynamics simulations to derive the protostellar accretion history in gravitationally unstable
disks around solar-mass protostars. We compared the time spacing between luminosity bursts \Delta\tau_mod,
caused by dense clumps spiralling on the protostar, with the differences of dynamical timescales
between the knots \Delta\tau_obs in CARMA 7. We found that the time spacing between the bursts have
a bi-modal distribution caused by isolated and clustered luminosity bursts. The former are characterized
by long quiescent periods between the bursts with \Delta\tau_mod = a few * (10^3-10^4) yr, whereas
the latter occur in small groups with time spacing between the bursts \Delta\tau_mod= a few * (10-10^2)
yr. For the clustered bursts, the distribution of \Delta\tau_mod in our models can be fit reasonably
well to the distribution of \Delta\tau_obs in the protostellar jet of CARMA 7, if a certain correction
for the (yet unknown) inclination angle with respect to the line of sight is applied. The K-S test
on the model and observational data sets suggests the best-fit values for the inclination angles
of 55-80 deg., which become narrower (75-80 deg.) if only strong luminosity bursts are considered.
The dynamical timescales of the knots in the jet of CARMA 7 are too short for a meaningful comparison
with the long time spacings between isolated bursts in our models. The exact sequences of time spacings
between the luminosity bursts in our models and knots in the jet of CARMA 7 were found difficult to
match. (abridged)
