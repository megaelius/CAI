Context: Asteroseismic measurements reveal that an unknown efficient angular momentum (AM) transport
mechanism is needed for subgiant and red giant stars. A revised prescription for AM transport by
the magnetic Tayler instability has been recently proposed as a possible candidate for such a missing
mechanism. Results: The revised prescription for the transport by the Tayler instability leads
to low core rotation rates after the main sequence that are in better global agreement with asteroseismic
measurements than those predicted by models with purely hydrodynamic processes or with the original
Tayler-Spruit dynamo. A detailed comparison with asteroseismic data shows that the rotational
properties of at most two of the six subgiants can be correctly reproduced by models accounting for
this revised magnetic transport process. This result is obtained independently of the value adopted
for the calibration parameter in this prescription. We also find that this transport by the Tayler
instability faces difficulties in simultaneously reproducing asteroseismic measurements available
for subgiant and red giant stars. The low values of the calibration parameter needed to correctly
reproduce the rotational properties of two of the six subgiants lead to core rotation rates during
the red giant phase that are too high. Inversely, the higher values of this parameter needed to reproduce
the core rotation rates of red giants lead to a very low degree of radial differential rotation before
the red giant phase, which is in contradiction with the internal rotation of subgiant stars. Conclusions:
In its present form, the revised prescription for the transport by the Tayler instability does not
provide a complete solution to the missing AM transport revealed by asteroseismology of evolved
stars.
