We present a grism extraction package (LINEAR) designed to reconstruct one-dimensional spectra
from a collection of slitless spectroscopic images, ideally taken at a variety of orientations,
dispersion directions, and/or dither positions. Our approach is to enumerate every transformation
between all direct image positions (ie. a potential source) and the collection of grism images at
all relevant wavelengths. This leads to solving a large, sparse system of linear equations, which
we invert using the standard LSQR algorithm. We implement a number of color and geometric corrections
(such as flat field, pixel-area map, source morphology, and spectral bandwidth), but assume many
effects have been calibrated out (such as basic reductions, background subtraction, and astrometric
refinement). We demonstrate the power of our approach with several Monte Carlo simulations and
the analysis of archival data. The simulations include astrometric and photometric uncertainties,
sky-background estimation, and signal-to-noise calculations. The data are G141 observations
obtained with the Wide-Field Camera 3 of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, and show the power of our formalism
by improving the spectral resolution without sacrificing the signal-to-noise (a tradeoff that
is often made by current approaches). Additionally, our approach naturally accounts for source
contamination, which is only handled heuristically by present softwares. We conclude with a discussion
of various observations where our approach will provide much improved spectral one-dimensional
spectra, such as crowded fields (star or galaxy clusters), spatially resolved spectroscopy, or
surveys with strict completeness requirements. At present our software is heavily geared for Wide-Field
Camera 3 IR, however we plan extend the codebase for additional instruments.
