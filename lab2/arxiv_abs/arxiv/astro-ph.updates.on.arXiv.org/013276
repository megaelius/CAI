The goal of Project GAUSS is to return samples from the dwarf planet Ceres. Ceres is the most accessible
ocean world candidate and the largest reservoir of water in the inner solar system. It shows active
cryovolcanism and hydrothermal activities in recent history that resulted in minerals not found
in any other planets to date except for Earth's upper crust. The possible occurrence of recent subsurface
ocean on Ceres and the complex geochemistry suggest possible past habitability and even the potential
for ongoing habitability. Aiming to answer a broad spectrum of questions about the origin and evolution
of Ceres and its potential habitability, GAUSS will return samples from this possible ocean world
for the first time. The project will address the following top-level scientific questions: 1) What
is the origin of Ceres and the origin and transfer of water and other volatiles in the inner solar system?
2) What are the physical properties and internal structure of Ceres? What do they tell us about the
evolutionary and aqueous alteration history of icy dwarf planets? 3) What are the astrobiological
implications of Ceres? Was it habitable in the past and is it still today? 4) What are the mineralogical
connections between Ceres and our current collections of primitive meteorites? GAUSS will first
perform a high-resolution global remote sensing investigation, characterizing the geophysical
and geochemical properties of Ceres. Candidate sampling sites will then be identified, and observation
campaigns will be run for an in-depth assessment of the candidate sites. Once the sampling site is
selected, a lander will be deployed on the surface to collect samples and return them to Earth in cryogenic
conditions that preserves the volatile and organic composition as well as the original physical
status as much as possible.
