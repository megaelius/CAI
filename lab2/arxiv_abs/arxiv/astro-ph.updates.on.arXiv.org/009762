Young, fast rotating single stars can show dramatically different magnetic signatures and levels
of magnetic activity as compared with the Sun. While losing angular momentum due to magnetic breaking
and mass loss through stellar winds, the stars gradually spin down resulting in decreasing levels
of activity. Studying magnetic activity on such solar analogues plays a key role in understanding
the evolution of solar-like stars and allows a glimpse into the past of the Sun as well. In order to
widen our knowledge of the magnetic evolution of the Sun and solar-like stars, magnetic activity
of the young solar analogue V1358 Ori is investigated. Fourier analysis of long-term photometric
data is used to derive rotational period and activity cycle length, while spectral synthesis is
applied on high resolution spectroscopic data in order to derive precise astrophysical parameters.
Doppler imaging is performed to recover surface temperature maps for two subsequent intervals.
Cross-correlation of the consecutive Doppler maps is used to derive surface differential rotation.
The rotational modulation of the chromospheric activity indicators is also investigated. An activity
cycle of $\approx 1600$ days is detected for V1358 Ori. Doppler imaging revealed a surface temperature
distribution dominated by a large polar cap with a few weaker features around the equator. This spot
configuration is similar to other maps of young solar analogues from the literature, and supports
recent model predictions. We detected solar-like surface differential rotation with a surface
shear parameter of $\alpha = 0.016 \pm 0.010$ which fits pretty well to our recently proposed empirical
relation between rotation and differential rotation. The chromospheric activity indicators
showed a rotational modulation.
