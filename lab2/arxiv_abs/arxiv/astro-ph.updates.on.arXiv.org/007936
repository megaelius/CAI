We present disc wind models aimed at reproducing the main features of the strong Na I resonance line
P-Cygni profiles in the rapidly-accreting pre-main sequence FU Ori objects. We conducted Monte
Carlo radiative transfer simulations for a standard magnetocentrifugally driven wind (MHD) model
and our own "Genwind" models, which allows for a more flexible wind parameterisation. We find that
the fiducial MHD wind and similar Genwind models, which have flows emerging outward from the inner
disc edge, and thus have polar cavities with no absorbing gas, cannot reproduce the deep, wide Na
I absorption lines in FU Ori objects viewed at low inclination. We find that it is necessary to include
an "inner wind" to fill this polar cavity to reproduce observations. In addition, our models assuming
pure scattering source functions in the Sobolev approximation at intermediate viewing angles
($30^{\circ} \lesssim i \lesssim 60^{\circ}$) do not yield sufficiently deep line profiles. Assuming
complete absorption yields better agreement with observations, but simple estimates strongly
suggest that pure scattering should be a much better approximation. The discrepancy may indicate
that the Sobolev approximation is not applicable, possibly due to turbulence or non-monotonic
velocity fields; there is some observational evidence for the latter. Our results provide guidance
for future attempts to constrain FU Ori wind properties using full MHD wind simulations, by pointing
to the importance of the boundary conditions necessary to give rise to an inner wind, and by suggesting
that the winds must be turbulent to produce sufficiently deep line profiles.
