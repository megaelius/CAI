(abridged) Context: Convective motions overshooting to regions that are formally convectively
stable cause extended mixing. Aims: To determine the scaling of overshooting depth ($d_{\rm os}$)
at the base of the convection zone as a function of imposed energy flux ($\mathscr{F}_{\rm n}$) and
to estimate the extent of overshooting at the base of the solar convection zone. Methods: Three-dimensional
Cartesian simulations of compressible non-rotating convection with unstable and stable layers
are used. The simulations use either a fixed heat conduction profile or a temperature and density
dependent formulation based on Kramers opacity law. The simulations cover a range of almost four
orders of magnitude in the imposed flux. Results: A smooth heat conduction profile (either fixed
or through Kramers opacity law) leads to a relatively shallow power law with $d_{\rm os}\propto
\mathscr{F}_{\rm n}^{0.08}$ for low $\mathscr{F}_{\rm n}$. A fixed step-profile of the heat conductivity
at the bottom of the convection zone leads to a somewhat steeper dependency with $d_{\rm os}\propto
\mathscr{F}_{\rm n}^{0.12}$. Experiments with and without subgrid-scale entropy diffusion
revealed a strong dependence on the effective Prandtl number which is likely to explain the steep
power laws as a function of $\mathscr{F}_{\rm n}$ reported in the literature. Furthermore, changing
the heat conductivity artificially below the convection zone is shown to lead to substantial underestimation
of overshooting depth. Conclusions: Extrapolating from the results obtained with smooth heat
conductivity profiles suggest that the overshooting depth for the solar flux is of the order of $0.2$
pressure scale heights at the base of the convection zone which is two to four times higher than estimates
from helioseismology.
