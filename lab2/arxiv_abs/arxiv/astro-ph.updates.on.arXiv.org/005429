The origin of ultracompact dwarfs (UCDs), a class of compact stellar systems discovered two decades
ago, still remains a matter of debate. Recent discoveries of central supermassive black holes in
UCDs likely inherited from their massive progenitor galaxies provide support for the tidal stripping
hypothesis. At the same time, on statistical grounds, some massive UCDs might be representatives
of the high luminosity tail of the globular cluster luminosity function. Here we present a detection
of a $3.3^{+1.4}_{-1.2}\times10^6\,M_{\odot}$ black hole ($1\sigma$ uncertainty) in the centre
of the UCD3 galaxy in the Fornax cluster, that corresponds to 4 per cent of its stellar mass. We performed
isotropic Jeans dynamical modelling of UCD3 using internal kinematics derived from adaptive optics
assisted observations with the SINFONI spectrograph and seeing limited data collected with the
FLAMES spectrograph at the ESO VLT. We rule out the zero black hole mass at the $3\sigma$ confidence
level when adopting a mass-to-light ratio inferred from stellar populations. This is the fourth
supermassive black hole found in a UCD and the first one in the Fornax cluster. Similarly to other
known UCDs that harbour black holes, UCD3 hosts metal rich stars enhanced in $\alpha$-elements
that supports the tidal stripping of a massive progenitor as its likely formation scenario. We estimate
that up to 80 per cent of luminous UCDs in galaxy clusters host central black holes. This fraction
should be lower for UCDs in groups, because their progenitors are more likely to be dwarf galaxies,
which do not tend to host central black holes.
