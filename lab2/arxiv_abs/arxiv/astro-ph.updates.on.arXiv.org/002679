We used multi-wavelength high-resolution data from ARIES, THEMIS, and SDO instruments, to analyze
a non-standard, C3.3 class flare produced within the active region NOAA 11589 on 2012 October 16.
Magnetic flux emergence and cancellation were continuously detected within the active region,
the latter leading to the formation of two filaments. Our aim is to identify the origins of the flare
taking into account the complex dynamics of its close surroundings. We analyzed the magnetic topology
of the active region using a linear force-free field extrapolation to derive its 3D magnetic configuration
and the location of quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) which are preferential sites for flaring activity.
Because the active region's magnetic field was nonlinear force-free, we completed a parametric
study using different linear force-free field extrapolations to demonstrate the robustness of
the derived QSLs. The topological analysis shows that the active region presented a complex magnetic
configuration comprising several QSLs. The considered data set suggests that an emerging flux
episode played a key role for triggering the flare. The emerging flux likely activated the complex
system of QSLs leading to multiple coronal magnetic reconnections within the QSLs. This scenario
accounts for the observed signatures: the two extended flare-ribbons developed at locations matched
by the photospheric footprints of the QSLs, and were accompanied with flare loops that formed above
the two filaments which played no important role in the flare dynamics. This is a typical example
of a complex flare that can a-priori show standard flare signatures that are nevertheless impossible
to interpret with any standard model of eruptive or confined flare. We find that a topological analysis
however permitted to unveil the development of such complex sets of flare signatures.
