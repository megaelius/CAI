Usual explanations of spiral galaxy rotation curves assume circular orbits of stars. The consequences
of giving up this assumption are investigated here. In particular, hyperbolic stellar trajectories
are found to be interesting. The two suggested models for the production of such trajectories will
also explain the observed flat rotation curves without the postulation of dark matter or MOND. It
is suggested that spiral galaxies may have started as compact objects with significant angular
momenta and then disintegrated. The first model conjectures the existence of a spinning hot disk
around a spherical galactic core. The disk is held together by local gravity and electromagnetic
scattering forces. However, it disintegrates at the edge producing fragments that form stars.
Once separated from the disk, the stars experience only the centrally directed gravitational force
due to the massive core and remaining disk. A numerical simulation shows that a high enough angular
velocity of the disk produces hyperbolic stellar trajectories that agree with the observed rotation
curves. The second model conjectures a significant initial thermonuclear event that produces
a dust plume along with large stars. This dust plume is made of ordinary matter. However, it acts like
the postulated dark matter in producing initial circular trajectories. Unlike dark matter, the
plume can be shown to escape the galaxy rapidly causing the star trajectories to evolve to hyperbolic
shapes. This process can be seen to produce the observed rotation curves due to the initial circular
orbits. Also, as the plume dissipates rapidly it does not obfuscate the stars from view. Both models
have weaknesses as do the currently known models using dark matter or MOND.
