We performed a far-IR imaging survey of the circumstellar dust shells of 144 evolved stars as a mission
programme of the AKARI infrared astronomical satellite using the Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS)
instrument. With this survey, we deliver far-IR surface brightness distributions of roughly 10'
x 40' or 10' x 20' areas of the sky around the target evolved stars in the four FIS bands at 65, 90, 140,
and 160 microns. Our objectives are to characterize the far-IR surface brightness distributions
of the cold dust component in the circumstellar dust shells, from which we derive the amount of cold
dust grains as low as 20 K and empirically establish the history of the early mass loss history. In
this first installment of the series, we introduce the project and its aims, describe the observations,
data reduction, and surface brightness correction process, and present the entire data set along
with the results of integrated photometry measurements (i.e., the central source and circumstellar
dust shell altogether). We find that (1) far-IR emission is detected from all but one object at the
spatial resolution about 30" - 50" in the corresponding bands, (2) roughly 60 - 70 % of the target sources
show some extension, (3) previously unresolved nearby objects in the far-IR are now resolved around
28 target sources, (4) the results of photometry measurements are reasonable with respect to the
entries in the AKARI/FIS Bright Source Catalogue, despite the fact that the targets are assumed
to be point-sources when catalogue flux densities were computed, and (5) an IR two-color diagram
would place the target sources in a roughly linear distribution that may correlate with the age of
the circumstellar dust shell and can potentially be used to identify which targets are more extended
than others.
