[Abridged] In recent years the view of Galactic globular clusters as simple stellar populations
has changed dramatically, as it is now thought that basically all GCs host multiple stellar populations,
each with its own chemical abundance pattern and colour-magnitude diagram sequence. Recent spectroscopic
observations of asymptotic giant branch stars in the GC NGC6752 have disclosed a low [Na/Fe] abundance
for the whole sample, suggesting that they are all first-generation stars, and that all second-generation
stars fail to reach the AGB in this cluster. A scenario proposed to explain these observations invokes
strong mass loss in second-generation horizontal branch stars possibly induced by the metal enhancement
associated to radiative levitation. This enhanced mass loss would prevent second generation stars
from reaching the AGB phase, thus explaining at the same time the low value of the ratio between HB
and AGB stars (the R_2 parameter) observed in NGC6752. We have critically discussed this scenario,
finding that the required mass-loss rates are of the order of 10^{-9} Mo/yr, significantly higher
than current theoretical and empirical constraints. By making use of synthetic HB simulations,
we demonstrate that our modelling predicts correctly the R_2 parameter for NGC6752, without the
need to invoke very efficient mass loss during the core He-burning stage. Our simulations for NGC6752
HB predict however the presence of a significant fraction - at the level of about 50% - second generation
stars along the cluster AGB. We conclude that there is no simple explanation for the lack of second
generation stars in the spectroscopically surveyed sample, although the interplay between mass
loss (with low rates) and radiative levitation may play a role in explaining this puzzle.
