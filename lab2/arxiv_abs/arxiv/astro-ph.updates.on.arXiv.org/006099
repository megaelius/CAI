Measurements of the galaxy UV luminosity function at z>6 suggest that young stars hosted in low-mass
star-forming galaxies produced the bulk of hydrogen-ionizing photons necessary to reionize the
intergalactic medium (IGM) by redshift z~6. Whether star-forming galaxies dominated cosmic reionization,
however, also depends on their stellar populations and interstellar medium properties, which
set, among other things, the production rate of H-ionizing photons, $\xi_\text{ion}^\star$,
and the fraction of these escaping into the IGM. Given the difficulty of constraining with existing
observatories the physical properties of z>6 galaxies, in this work we focus on a sample of ten nearby
objects showing UV spectral features comparable to those observed at z>6. We use the new-generation
Beagle tool to model the UV-to-optical photometry and UV/optical emission lines of these Local
'analogues' of high-redshift galaxies, finding that our relatively simple, yet fully self-consistent,
physical model can successfully reproduce the different observables considered. Our galaxies
span a broad range of metallicities and are characterised by high ionization parameters, low dust
attenuation, and very young stellar populations. Through our analysis, we derive a novel diagnostic
of the production rate of H-ionizing photons per unit UV luminosity, $\xi_\text{ion}^\star$,
based on the equivalent width of the bright $[\text{OIII}] \lambda 4959,5007$ doublet, which does
not require measurements of H-recombination lines. This new diagnostic can be used to estimate
$\xi_\text{ion}^\star$ from future direct measurements of the $[\text{OIII}] \lambda 4959,5007$
line using JWST/NIRSpec (out to z~9.5), and by exploiting the contamination by $\text{H}\beta
+ [\text{OIII}] \lambda 4959,5007$ of photometric observations of distant galaxies, for instance
from existing Spitzer/IRAC data and from future ones with JWST/NIRCam.
