Weak-lensing peak counts has been shown to be a powerful tool for cosmology. It provides non-Gaussian
information of large scale structures, complementary to second order statistics. We propose a
new flexible method to predict weak lensing peak counts, which can be adapted to realistic scenarios,
such as a real source distribution, intrinsic galaxy alignment, mask effects, photo-$z$ errors
from surveys, etc. The new model is also suitable for applying the tomography technique and non-linear
filters. A probabilistic approach to model peak counts is presented. First, we sample halos from
a mass function. Second, we assign them NFW profiles. Third, we place those halos randomly on the
field of view. The creation of these "fast simulations" requires much less computing time compared
to $N$-body runs. Then, we perform ray-tracing through these fast simulation boxes and select peaks
from weak-lensing maps to predict peak number counts. The computation is achieved by our CAMELUS
algorithm, which we make available at this http URL We compare our results to $N$-body simulations
to validate our model. We find that our approach is in good agreement with full $N$-body runs. We show
that the lensing signal dominates shape noise and Poisson noise for peaks with SNR between 4 and 6.
Also, counts from the same SNR range are sensitive to $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and $\sigma_8$. We show
how our model can discriminate between various combinations of those two parameters. In this paper,
we offer a powerful tool to study weak lensing peaks. The potential of our forward model is its high
flexibility, making the use of peak counts under realistic survey conditions feasible.
