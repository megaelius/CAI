The Neptunian satellite system is unusual, comprising Triton, a large ($\sim2700$ km) moon on a
close-in, circular, yet retrograde orbit, flanked by Nereid, the largest irregular satellite
($\sim$300 km) on a highly eccentric orbit. Capture origins have been previously suggested for
both moons. Here we explore an alternative in-situ formation model where the two satellites accreted
in the circum-Neptunian disk and are imparted irregular and eccentric orbits by a deep planetary
encounter with an ice giant (IG), like that predicted in the Nice scenario of early solar system development.
We use $N$-body simulations of an IG approaching Neptune to 20 Neptunian radi ($R_\mathrm{Nep}$),
through a belt of circular prograde regular satellites at 10-30 $R_\mathrm{Nep}$. We find that
half of these primordial satellites remain bound to Neptune and that 0.4-3\% are scattered directly
onto wide and eccentric orbits resembling that of Nereid. With better matches to the observed orbit,
our model has a success rate comparable to or higher than capture of large Nereid-sized irregular
satellites from heliocentric orbit. At the same time, the IG encounter injects a large primordial
moon onto a retrograde orbit with specific angular momentum similar to Triton's in 0.3-3\% of our
runs. While less efficient than capture scenarios (Agnor & Hamilton 2006), our model does indicate
that an in-situ origin for Triton is dynamically possible. We also simulate the post-encounter
collisional and tidal orbital evolution of Triton analogue satellites and find they are decoupled
from Nereid on timescales of $\sim$$10^4$ years, in agreement with Cuk & Gladman (2005).
