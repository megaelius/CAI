Giant radio relics in the outskirts of galaxy clusters are known to be lit up by the relativistic electrons
produced via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in shocks with low sonic Mach numbers, $M_{\rm
s}\lesssim3$. The particle acceleration at these collisionless shocks critically depends on
the kinetic plasma processes that govern the injection to DSA. Here, we study the preacceleration
of suprathermal electrons in weak, quasi-perpendicular ($Q_\perp$) shocks in the hot, high-$\beta$
($\beta = P_{\rm gas}/P_{\rm B}$) intracluster medium (ICM) through two-dimensional particle-in-cell
simulations. \citet{guo2014a,guo2014b} showed that in high-$\beta$ $Q_\perp$-shocks, some
of incoming electrons could be reflected upstream and gain energy via shock drift acceleration
(SDA). The temperature anisotropy due to the SDA-energized electrons then induces the electron
firehose instability (EFI), and oblique waves are generated, leading to a Fermi-like process and
multiple cycles of SDA in the preshock region. We find that such electron preacceleration is effective
only in shocks above a critical Mach number $M_{\rm ef}^*\approx2.3$. This means that in ICM plasmas,
$Q_\perp$-shocks with $M_{\rm s}\lesssim2.3$ may not efficiently accelerate electrons. We also
find that even in $Q_\perp$-shocks with $M_{\rm s}\gtrsim2.3$, electrons may not reach high enough
energies to be injected to the full Fermi-I process of DSA, because long-wavelength waves are not
developed via the EFI alone. Our results indicate that additional electron preaccelerations are
required for DSA in ICM shocks, and the presence of fossil relativistic electrons in the shock upstream
region may be necessary to explain observed radio relics.
