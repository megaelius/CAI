A space-based very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) programme, named as the Cosmic Microscope,
is proposed to involve dual VLBI telescopes in the space working together with giant ground-based
telescopes (e.g., Square Kilometre Array, FAST, Arecibo) to image the low radio frequency Universe
with the purpose of unraveling the compact structure of cosmic constituents including supermassive
black holes and binaries, pulsars, astronomical masers and the underlying source, and exoplanets
amongst others. The operational frequency bands are 30, 74, 330 and 1670 MHz, supporting broad science
areas. The mission plans to launch two 30-m-diameter radio telescopes into 2,000 km x 90,000 km elliptical
orbits. The two telescopes can work in flexibly diverse modes: (i) space-ground VLBI. The maximum
space-ground baseline length is about 100,000 km; it provides a high-dynamic-range imaging capacity
with unprecedented high resolutions at low frequencies (0.4 mas at 1.67 GHz and 20 mas at 30 MHz) enabling
studies of exoplanets and supermassive black hole binaries (which emit nanoHz gravitational waves);
(ii) space-space single-baseline VLBI. This unique baseline enables the detection of flaring
hydroxyl masers, and more precise position measurement of pulsars and radio transients at milli-arcsecond
level; (iii) single dish mode, where each telescope can be used to monitor transient bursts and rapidly
trigger follow-up VLBI observations. The large space telescope will also contribute in measuring
and constraining the total angular power spectrum from the Epoch of Reionization. In short, the
Cosmic Microscope offers astronomers the opportunity to conduct novel, frontier science.
