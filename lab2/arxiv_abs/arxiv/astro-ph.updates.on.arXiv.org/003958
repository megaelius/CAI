We investigate the onset of 2D time-dependent magnetic reconnection that is triggered using an
external velocity driver located away from, and perpendicular to, an equilibrium Harris current
sheet. Previous studies have typically utilised an internal trigger to initiate reconnection,
e.g. initial conditions centred on the current sheet. Numerical simulations solving the compressible,
resistive magnetohydrodynamics equations were performed to investigate the reconnection onset
within different atmospheric layers of the Sun, namely the corona, chromosphere and photosphere.
A reconnecting state is reached for all atmospheric heights considered, with the dominant physics
being highly dependent on atmospheric conditions. The coronal case achieves a sharp rise in electric
field for a range of velocity drivers. For the chromosphere, we find a larger velocity amplitude
is required to trigger reconnection. For the photospheric environment, the electric field is highly
dependent on the inflow speed; a sharp increase in electric field is obtained only as the velocity
entering the reconnection region approaches the Alfven speed. Additionally, the role of ambipolar
diffusion is investigated for the chromospheric case and we find that the ambipolar diffusion alters
the structure of the current density in the inflow region. The rate at which flux enters the reconnection
region is controlled by the inflow velocity. This determines all aspects of the reconnection start-up
process, i.e. the early onset of reconnection is dominated by the advection term in Ohms law in all
atmospheric layers. A lower plasma-$\beta$ enhances reconnection and creates a large change in
the electric field. A high plasma-$\beta$ hinders the reconnection, yielding a sharp rise in the
electric field only when the velocity flowing into the reconnection region approaches the local
Alfven speed.
