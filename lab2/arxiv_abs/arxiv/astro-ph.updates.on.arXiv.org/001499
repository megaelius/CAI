We propose a catastrophic eruption model for magnetar's enormous energy release during giant flares,
in which a toroidal and helically twisted flux rope is embedded within a force-free magnetosphere.
The flux rope stays in stable equilibrium states initially and evolves quasi-statically. Upon
the loss of equilibrium point is reached, the flux rope cannot sustain the stable equilibrium states
and erupts catastrophically. During the process, the magnetic energy stored in the magnetosphere
is rapidly released as the result of destabilization of global magnetic topology. The magnetospheric
energy that could be accumulated is of vital importance for the outbursts of magnetars. We carefully
establish the fully open fields and partially open fields for various boundary conditions at the
magnetar surface and study the relevant energy thresholds. By investigating the magnetic energy
accumulated at the critical catastrophic point, we find that it is possible to drive fully open eruptions
for dipole dominated background fields. Nevertheless, it is hard to generate fully open magnetic
eruptions for multipolar background fields. Given the observational importance of the multipolar
magnetic fields in the vicinity of the magnetar surface, it would be worthwhile to explore the possibility
of the alternative eruption approach in multipolar background fields. Fortunately, we find that
flux ropes may give rise to partially open eruptions in the multipolar fields, which involve only
partial opening up of background fields. The energy release fractions are greater for cases with
central-arcaded multipoles than those with central-caved multipoles emerged in background fields.
Eruptions would fail only when the centrally-caved multipoles become extremely strong.
