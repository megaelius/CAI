The assumption of a spatially uniform helium distribution in the intracluster medium can lead to
biases in the estimates of key cluster parameters if composition gradients are present. The helium
concentration profile in galaxy clusters is unfortunately not directly observable. Current models
addressing the putative sedimentation are one-dimensional and parametrize the presence of magnetic
fields in a crude way, ignoring the weakly-collisional, magnetized nature of the medium. When these
effects are considered, a wide variety of instabilities can play an important role in the plasma
dynamics. In a series of recent papers, we have developed the local, linear theory of these instabilities
and addressed their non-linear development with a modified version of Athena. Here, we extend our
study by developing a quasi-global approach that we use to simulate the mixing of helium as induced
by generalizations of the heat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI) and the magneto-thermal
instability (MTI), which feed off thermal and composition gradients. In the inner region of the
ICM, mixing can occur on few Gyrs, after which the average magnetic field inclination angle is $\sim
45^{\circ}$ resulting in an averaged Spitzer parameter higher by about 20 % than the value obtained
in homogeneous simulations. In the cluster outskirts the instabilities are rather inefficient,
due to the shallow gradients. This suggests that compositions gradients in cluster cores might
be shallower than one-dimensional models predict. More quantitative statements demand more refined
models that can incorporate the physics driving the sedimentation process and simultaneously
account for the weakly-collisional nature of the plasma.
