Although turbulence has been conjectured to be important for magnetic reconnection, still very
little is known about its role in collisionless plasmas. Previous attempts to quantify the effect
of turbulence on reconnection usually prescribed Alfv\'enic or other low-frequency fluctuations
or investigated collisionless kinetic effects in just two-dimensional configurations and antiparallel
magnetic fields. In view of this, we analyzed the kinetic turbulence self-generated by three-dimensional
guide-field reconnection through force-free current sheets in frequency and wavenumber spaces,
utilizing 3D particle-in-cell code numerical simulations. Our investigations reveal reconnection
rates and kinetic turbulence with features similar to those obtained by current in-situ spacecraft
observations of MMS as well as in the laboratory reconnection experiments MRX, VTF and \textsc{Vineta}-II.
In particular we found that the kinetic turbulence developing in the course of 3D guide-field reconnection
exhibits a broadband power-law spectrum extending beyond the lower-hybrid frequency and up to
the electron frequencies. In the frequency space the spectral index of the turbulence appeared
to be close to -2.8 at the reconnection X-line. In the wavenumber space it also becomes -2.8 as soon
as the normalized reconnection rate reaches 0.1. The broadband kinetic turbulence is mainly due
to current-streaming and electron-flow-shear instabilities excited in the sufficiently thin
current sheets of kinetic reconnection. The growth of the kinetic turbulence corresponds to high
reconnection rates which exceed those of fast laminar, non-turbulent reconnection.
