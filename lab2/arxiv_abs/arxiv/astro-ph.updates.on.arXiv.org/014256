Possible models for the generation of electromagnetic (EM) radiation during the coalescence of
neutron star-black hole binaries are considered. The mass of the remnant disk around the black hole
during the coalescence of neutron stars and black holes is calculated by taking into account the
equation of state for neutron stars and the rotation of the binary components before the coalescence.
The parameters of binary systems before the coalescence (the mass ratio, the component rotation,
the neutron star magnetic field) are calculated by the population synthesis method. The derived
mass of the remnant disk around the black hole after the coalescence is used to estimate the kinetic
energy of the relativistic jet launched by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. A disk mass of more than
$\sim 0.05 M_\odot$ required for the formation of short gamma-ray bursts is shown to be obtained
in no more than 1-10\% of the coalescences (depending on the equation of state). Less efficient common
envelopes (a large parameter $\alpha_{CE}$) lead to a noticeably larger percentage of events with
astrophysically interesting EM energy release. For binaries with a large mass ratio, in which a
magnetized neutron star is not subjected to tidal disruption before the coalescence, the possibility
of the formation of an electrically charged rotating black hole (Wald charge) is considered and
estimates of the maximum EM power released by such a black hole after the coalescence are made. The
conversion of the emitted gravitational waves into electromagnetic ones in the relativistic lepton
plasma generated in coalescing pulsar-black hole binaries at the pre-coalescence stage is discussed.
