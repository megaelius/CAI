In the Solar System, extra-terrestrial organic molecules have been found on cometary primitive
objects, on Titan and Enceladus icy moons and on Mars. Identification could be achieved for simple
organic species by remote sensing based on spectroscopic methods. However in situ mass spectrometry
is a key technology to determine the nature of more complex organic matter. A new concept of mass analyser
offering ultra-high mass resolving power of more than 50,000 at m/z 56 (under high vacuum condition
about 10-9 mbar) is currently being developed for space applications: the CosmOrbitrap (Briois
et al., 2016), based on the OrbitrapTM technology. This work challenges the use of LAb-CosmOrbitrap,
a space instrument prototype combining Laser Ablation ionisation and the CosmOrbitrap mass analyser,
to identify solid organic molecules of relevance to the future space exploration. For this purpose
a blind test was jointly organised by the JAXA-HRMS team (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency-High
Resolution Mass Spectrometry) and the CosmOrbitrap consortium. The JAXA team provided two organic
samples, whereas the CosmOrbitrap consortium analysed them without prior information. Thanks
to the high analytical performances of the prototype and our HRMS data post-processing, we successfully
identified the two molecules as HOBt, hydroxybenzotriazole (C6H5N3O) and BBOT, 2,5-Bis(5-tert-butyl-benzoxazol-2-yl)thiophene
(C26H26N2O2S), with a mass resolving power of, respectively, 123 540 and 69 219. The success of this
blind test on complex organic molecules shows the strong potential of LAb-CosmOrbitrap for future
space applications.
