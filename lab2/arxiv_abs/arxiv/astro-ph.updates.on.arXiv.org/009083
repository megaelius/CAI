The depth of an exoplanetary transit in the light curve of a distant star is commonly approximated
as the squared planet-to-star radius ratio, (R_p/R_s)^2. Stellar limb darkening, however, results
in significantly deeper transits. Here we derive analytical solutions to the overshoot of the mid-transit
depth caused by stellar limb darkening compared to the (R_p/R_s)^2 estimate for arbitrary transit
impact parameters. In turn, this allows us to compute the true planet-to-star radius ratio from
the transit depth for a given parameterization of a limb darkening law and for a known transit impact
parameter. We calculate the maximum emerging specific stellar intensity covered by the planet
in transit and derive analytic solutions for the transit depth overshoot. Solutions are presented
for the linear, quadratic, square-root, logarithmic, and non-linear stellar limb darkening with
arbitrary transit impact parameters. We also derive formulae to calculate the average intensity
along the transit chord, which allows us to estimate the actual transit depth (and therefore R_p/R_s)
from the mean in-transit flux. The transit depth overshoot of exoplanets compared to the (R_p/R_s)^2
estimate increases from about 15% for A main-sequence stars to roughly 20% for sun-like stars and
some 30% for K and M stars. The error in our analytical solutions for R_p/R_s from the small planet
approximation is orders of magnitude smaller than the uncertainties arising from typical noise
in real light curves and from the uncertain limb darkening. Our equations can be used to predict with
high accuracy the expected transit depth of extrasolar planets. The actual planet radius can be
calculated from the measured transit depth or from the mean in-transit flux if the stellar limb darkening
can be properly parameterized and if the transit impact parameter is known. Light curve fitting
is not required.
