The atmospheres of small, potentially rocky exoplanets are expected to cover a diverse range in
composition and mass. Studying such objects therefore requires flexible and wide-ranging modeling
capabilities. We present in this work the essential development steps that lead to our flexible
radiative transfer module, REDFOX, and validate REDFOX for the Solar system planets Earth, Venus
and Mars, as well as for steam atmospheres. REDFOX is a k-distribution model using the correlated-k
approach with random overlap method for the calculation of opacities used in the $\delta$-two-stream
approximation for radiative transfer. Opacity contributions from Rayleigh scattering, UV / visible
cross sections and continua can be added selectively. With the improved capabilities of our new
model, we calculate various atmospheric scenarios for K2-18b, a super-Earth / sub-Neptune with
$\sim$8 M$_\oplus$ orbiting in the temperate zone around an M-star, with recently observed H$_2$O
spectral features in the infrared. We model Earth-like, Venus-like, as well as H$_2$-He primary
atmospheres of different Solar metallicity and show resulting climates and spectral characteristics,
compared to observed data. Our results suggest that K2-18b has an H$_2$-He atmosphere with limited
amounts of H$_2$O and CH$_4$. Results do not support the possibility of K2-18b having a water reservoir
directly exposed to the atmosphere, which would reduce atmospheric scale heights, hence too the
amplitudes of spectral features inconsistent with the observations. We also performed tests for
H$_2$-He atmospheres up to 50 times Solar metallicity, all compatible with the observations.
