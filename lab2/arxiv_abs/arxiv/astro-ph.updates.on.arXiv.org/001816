If binaries consisting of two 100 Msun black holes exist they would serve as extraordinarily powerful
gravitational-wave sources, detectable to redshifts of z=2 with the advanced LIGO/Virgo ground-based
detectors. Large uncertainties about the evolution of massive stars preclude definitive rate
predictions for mergers of these massive black holes. We show that rates as high as hundreds of detections
per year, or as low as no detections whatsoever, are both possible. It was thought that the only way
to produce these massive binaries was via dynamical interactions in dense stellar systems. This
view has been challenged by the recent discovery of several stars with mass above 150 Msun in the R136
region of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Current models predict that when stars of this mass leave the
main sequence, their expansion is insufficient to allow common envelope evolution to efficiently
reduce the orbital separation. The resulting black-hole--black-hole binary remains too wide
to be able to coalesce within a Hubble time. If this assessment is correct, isolated very massive
binaries do not evolve to be gravitational-wave sources. However, other formation channels exist.
For example, the high multiplicity of massive stars, and their common formation in relatively dense
stellar associations, opens up dynamical channels for massive black hole mergers (e.g., via Kozai
cycles or repeated binary-single interactions). We identify key physical factors that shape the
population of very massive black-hole--black-hole binaries. Advanced gravitational-wave detectors
will provide important constraints on the formation and evolution of very massive stars.
