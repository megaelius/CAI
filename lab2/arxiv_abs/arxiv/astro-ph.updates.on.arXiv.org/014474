Accreting supermassive black holes are sources of polarized radiation that propagates through
highly curved spacetime before reaching the observer. In order to help interpret observations
of such polarized emission, accurate and efficient numerical schemes for polarized radiative
transfer in curved spacetime are needed. In this manuscript we extend our publicly available radiative
transfer code RAPTOR to include polarization. We provide a brief review of different codes and methods
for covariant polarized radiative transfer available in the literature and existing codes, and
present an efficient new scheme. For the spacetime-propagation aspect of the computation, we develop
a compact, Lorentz-invariant representation of a polarized ray. For the plasma-propagation aspect
of the computation, we perform a formal analysis of the stiffness of the polarized radiative-transfer
equation with respect to our explicit integrator, and develop a hybrid integration scheme that
switches to an implicit integrator in case of stiffness, in order to solve the equation with optimal
speed and accuracy for all possible values of the local optical/Faraday thickness of the plasma.
We perform a comprehensive code verification by solving a number of well-known test problems using
RAPTOR and comparing its output to exact solutions. We also demonstrate convergence with existing
polarized radiative-transfer codes in the context of complex astrophysical problems. RAPTOR
is capable of performing polarized radiative transfer in arbitrary, highly curved spacetimes.
This capability is crucial for interpreting polarized observations of accreting black holes,
which can yield information about the magnetic-field configuration in such accretion flows. The
efficient formalism implemented in RAPTOR is computationally light and conceptually simple.
The code is publicly available.
