Gaia DR2 has delivered full-sky 6-D measurements for millions of stars, and the quest to understand
the dynamics of our Galaxy has entered a new phase. Our aim is to reveal and characterize the kinematic
sub-structure of the different Galactic neighbourhoods, to form a picture of their spatial evolution
that can be used to infer the Galactic potential, its evolution and its components. We take ~5 million
stars in the Galactic disk from the Gaia DR2 catalogue and build the velocity distribution of many
different Galactic Neighbourhoods distributed along 5 kpc in Galactic radius and azimuth. We decompose
their distribution of stars in the V_R-V_phi plane with the wavelet transformation and asses the
statistical significance of the structures found. We detect many kinematic sub-structures (arches
and more rounded groups) that diminish their azimuthal velocity as a function of Galactic radius
in a continuous way, connecting volumes up to 3 kpc apart in some cases. The decrease rate is, on average,
of ~23 km/s/kpc. In azimuth, the kinematic sub-structures present much smaller variations. We
also observe a duality in their behaviour: some conserve their vertical angular momentum with radius
(e.g., Hercules), while some seem to have nearly constant kinetic energy (e.g., Sirius). These
two trends are consistent with the approximate predictions of resonances and of phase mixing, respectively.
Besides, the overall spatial evolution of Hercules is consistent with being related to the Outer
Lindblad Resonance of the Bar. We also detect structures without apparent counterpart in the vicinity
of the Sun. The various trends observed and their continuity with radius and azimuth allows for future
work to deeply explore the parameter space of the models. Also, the characterization of extrasolar
moving groups opens the opportunity to expand our understanding of the Galaxy beyond the Solar Neighbourhood.
