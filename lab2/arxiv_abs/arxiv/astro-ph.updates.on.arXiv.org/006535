Convective motions in solar-type stellar atmospheres induce Doppler shifts that affect the strengths
and shapes of spectral absorption lines and create slightly asymmetric line profiles. 1D LTE studies
of elemental abundances are not able to reproduce this phenomenon, which becomes particularly
important when modeling the impact of isotopic fine structure, like the subtle depression created
by the 6Li isotope on the red wing of the Li I resonance doublet line. The purpose of this work is to provide
corrections for the lithium abundance, A(Li), and the 6Li/7Li ratio that can easily be applied to
correct 1D LTE lithium abundances in G and F dwarf stars of approximately solar mass and metallicity
for 3D and non-LTE (NLTE) effects. The corrections for A(Li) and 6Li/7Li are computed using grids
of 3D NLTE and 1D LTE synthetic lithium line profiles, generated from 3D hydro-dynamical CO5BOLD
and 1D hydrostatic model atmospheres, respectively. The 3D NLTE corrections are then approximated
by analytical expressions as a function of the stellar parameters. These are applied to adjust the
1D LTE isotopic lithium abundances in two solar-type stars, HD 207129 and HD 95456. The derived 3D
NLTE corrections range between -0.01 and +0.11 dex for A(Li), and between -4.9 and -0.4% for the 6Li/7Li
ratio, depending on the adopted stellar parameters. In the case of the 6Li/7Li ratio, our corrections
are always negative, showing that 1D LTE analysis can significantly overestimate (up to 4.9 percentage
points) the presence of 6Li in the atmospheres of solar-like dwarf stars. These results emphasize
the importance of reliable 3D model atmospheres combined with NLTE line formation for deriving
precise isotopic lithium abundances. Although 3D NLTE spectral synthesis implies an extensive
computational effort, the results can be made accessible with parametric tools like the ones presented
in this work.
