The determination of accurate stellar parameters of giant stars is essential for our understanding
of such stars in general and as exoplanet host stars in particular. Precise stellar masses are vital
for determining the lower mass limit of potential substellar companions with the radial velocity
method. Our goal is to determine stellar parameters, including mass, radius, age, surface gravity,
effective temperature and luminosity, for the sample of giants observed by the Lick planet search.
Furthermore, we want to derive the probability of these stars being on the horizontal branch (HB)
or red giant branch (RGB), respectively. We compare spectroscopic, photometric and astrometric
observables to grids of stellar evolutionary models using Bayesian inference. We provide tables
of stellar parameters, probabilities for the current post-main sequence evolutionary stage,
and probability density functions for 372 giants from the Lick planet search. We find that $81\%$
of the stars in our sample are more probably on the HB. In particular, this is the case for 15 of the 16
planet host stars in the sample. We tested the reliability of our methodology by comparing our stellar
parameters to literature values and find very good agreement. Furthermore, we created a small test
sample of 26 giants with available asteroseismic masses and evolutionary stages and compared these
to our estimates. The mean difference of the stellar masses for the 24 stars with the same evolutionary
stages by both methods is only $\langle\Delta M\rangle=0.01\pm0.20\;\mathrm{M_\odot}$. We
do not find any evidence for large systematic differences between our results and estimates of stellar
parameters based on other methods. In particular we find no significant systematic offset between
stellar masses provided by asteroseismology to our Bayesian estimates based on evolutionary models.
