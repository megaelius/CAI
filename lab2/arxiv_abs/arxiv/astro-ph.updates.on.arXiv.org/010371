The primary scientific target of the CMB polarization experiments that are currently being built
and proposed is the detection of primordial tensor perturbations. As a byproduct, these instruments
will significantly improve constraints on cosmic birefringence, or the rotation of the CMB polarization
plane. If convincingly detected, cosmic birefringence would be a dramatic manifestation of physics
beyond the standard models of particle physics and cosmology. We forecast the bounds on the cosmic
polarization rotation (CPR) from the upcoming ground-based Simons Observatory (SO) and the space-based
LiteBIRD experiments, as well as a "fourth generation" ground-based CMB experiment like CMB-S4
and the mid-cost space mission PICO. We examine the detectability of both a stochastic anisotropic
rotation field and an isotropic rotation by a constant angle. CPR induces new correlations of CMB
observables, including spectra of parity-odd type in the case of isotropic CPR, and mode-coupling
correlations in the anisotropic rotation case. We find that LiteBIRD and SO will reduce the 1$\sigma$
bound on the isotropic CPR from the current value of 30 arcmin to 1.5 and 0.6 arcmin, respectively,
while CMB-S4-like and PICO will reduce it to $\sim 0.1$ arcmin. The bounds on the amplitude of a scale-invariant
CPR spectrum will be reduced by 1, 2 and 3 orders of magnitude by LiteBIRD, SO and CMB-S4-like/PICO,
respectively. We discuss implications of the forecasted CPR bounds for pseudoscalar fields, primordial
magnetic fields (PMF), and violations of Lorentz invariance. We find that CMB-S4-like and PICO
can reduce the 1$\sigma$ bound on the amplitude of the scale-invariant PMF from 1 nG to 0.1 nG, while
also probing the magnetic field of the Milky Way. They will also significantly improve bounds on
the axion-photon coupling, placing stringent constraints on the string theory axions.
