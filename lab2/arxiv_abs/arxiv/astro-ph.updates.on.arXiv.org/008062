Galaxy observations are influenced by many physical parameters: stellar masses, star formation
rates (SFRs), star formation histories (SFHs), metallicities, dust, black hole activity, and
more. As a result, inferring accurate physical parameters requires high-dimensional models which
capture or marginalize over this complexity. Here we re-assess inferences of galaxy stellar masses
and SFRs using the 14-parameter physical model Prospector-$\alpha$ built in the Prospector Bayesian
inference framework. We fit the photometry of 58,461 galaxies from the 3D-HST catalogs at $0.5 <
z < 2.5$. The resulting stellar masses are $\sim0.1-0.3$ dex larger than the fiducial masses while
remaining consistent with dynamical constraints. This change is primarily due to the systematically
older SFHs inferred with Prospector. The SFRs are $\sim0.1-1+$ dex lower than UV+IR SFRs, with the
largest offsets caused by emission from "old" ($t>100$ Myr) stars. These new inferences lower the
observed cosmic star formation rate density by $\sim0.2$ dex and increase the observed stellar
mass growth by $\sim 0.1$ dex, finally bringing these two quantities into agreement and implying
an older, more quiescent Universe than found by previous studies at these redshifts. We corroborate
these results by showing that the Prospector-$\alpha$ SFHs are both more physically realistic
and are much better predictors of the evolution of the stellar mass function. Finally, we highlight
examples of observational data which can break degeneracies in the current model; these observations
can be incorporated into priors in future models to produce new & more accurate physical parameters.
