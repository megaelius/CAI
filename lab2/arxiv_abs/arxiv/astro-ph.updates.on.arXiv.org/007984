The merger of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) is not expected to generate detectable electromagnetic
(EM) emission. However, the gravitational wave (GW) events GW150914 and GW170104, detected by
the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) to be the result of merging, ~60
solar mass binary black holes (BBHs), each have claimed coincident gamma-ray emission. Motivated
by the intriguing possibility of an EM counterpart to BBH mergers, we construct a model that can reproduce
the observed EM and GW signals for GW150914- and GW170104-like events, from a single-star progenitor.
Following Loeb (2016), we envision a massive, rapidly rotating star within which a rotating bar
instability fractures the core into two overdensities that fragment into clumps which merge to
form BHs in a tight binary with arbitrary spin-orbit alignment. Once formed, the BBH inspirals due
to gas and gravitational-wave drag until tidal forces trigger strong feeding of the BHs with the
surrounding stellar-density gas about 10 seconds before merger. The resulting giga-Eddington
accretion peak launches a jet that breaks out of the progenitor star and drives a powerful outflow
that clears the gas from the orbit of the binary within one second, preserving the vacuum GW waveform
in the LIGO band. The single-progenitor scenario predicts the existence of variability of the gamma-ray
burst, modulated at the ~0.2 second chirping period of the BBH due to relativistic Doppler boost.
The jet breakout should be accompanied by a low-luminosity supernova. Finally, because the BBHs
of the single progenitor model do not exist at large separations, they will not be detectable in the
low frequency gravitational wave band of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Hence,
the single-progenitor BBHs will be unambiguously discernible from BBHs formed through alternate,
double-progenitor evolution scenarios.
