Clustering of dark matter halos has been shown to depend on halo properties beyond mass such as halo
concentration, a phenomenon referred to as halo assembly bias. Standard halo occupation models
(HOD) in large scale structure studies assume that halo mass alone is sufficient in characterizing
the connection between galaxies and halos. Modeling of galaxy clustering can face systematic effects
if the number of galaxies within a halo is correlated with other halo properties. Using the Small
MultiDark-Planck high resolution $N$-body simulation and the clustering measurements of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 main galaxy sample, we investigate the extent to which the concentration-dependence
of halo occupation can be constrained. Furthermore, we study how allowing for the concentration
dependence can improve our modeling of galaxy clustering. Our constraints on HOD with assembly
bias suggest that satellite population is not correlated with halo concentration at fixed halo
mass. At fixed halo mass, our constraints favor lack of correlation between the occupation of centrals
and halo concentration in the most luminous samples ($M_{\rm r}<-21.5,-21$), and modest correlation
in the $M_{\rm r}<-20.5,-20, -19.5$ samples. We show that in comparison with abundance-matching
mock catalogs, our findings suggest qualitatively similar but modest levels of the impact of halo
assembly bias on galaxy clustering. The effect is only present in the central occupation and becomes
less significant in brighter galaxy samples. Furthermore, by performing model comparison based
on information criteria, we find that in most cases, the standard mass-only HOD model is still favored
by the observations.
