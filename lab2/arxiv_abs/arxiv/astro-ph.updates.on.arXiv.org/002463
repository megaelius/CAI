We develop a method for performing a weak lensing analysis using only measurements of galaxy position
angles. By analysing the statistical properties of the galaxy orientations given a known intrinsic
ellipticity distribution, we show that it is possible to obtain estimates of the shear by minimizing
a $\chi^2$ statistic. The method is demonstrated using simulations where the components of the
intrinsic ellipticity are taken to be Gaussian distributed. Uncertainties in the position angle
measurements introduce a bias into the shear estimates which can be reduced to negligible levels
by introducing a correction term into the formalism. We generalize our approach by developing an
algorithm to obtain direct shear estimators given any azimuthally symmetric intrinsic ellipticity
distribution. We introduce a method of measuring the position angles of the galaxies from noisy
pixelized images, and propose a method to correct for biases which arise due to pixelization and
correlations between measurement errors and galaxy ellipticities. We also develop a method to
constrain the sample of galaxies used to obtain an estimate of the intrinsic ellipticity distribution
such that fractional biases in the resulting shear estimates are below a given threshold value.
We demonstrate the angle only method by applying it to simulations where the ellipticities are taken
to follow a log-normal distribution. We compare the performance of the position angle only method
with the standard method based on full ellipticity measurements by reconstructing lensing convergence
maps from both numerical simulations and from the CFHTLenS data. We find that the difference between
the convergence maps reconstructed using the two methods is consistent with noise.
