The possibility that primordial black holes constitute a fraction of dark matter motivates a detailed
study of possible mechanisms for their production. Black holes can form by the collapse of primordial
curvature fluctuations, if the amplitude of their small scale spectrum gets amplified by several
orders of magnitude with respect to CMB scales. Such enhancement can for example occur in single-field
inflation that exhibit a transient non-attractor phase: in this work, we make a detailed investigation
of the shape of the curvature spectrum in this scenario. We make use of an analytical approach based
on a gradient expansion of curvature perturbations, which allows us to follow the changes in slope
of the spectrum during its way from large to small scales. After encountering a dip in its amplitude,
the spectrum can acquire steep slopes with a spectral index up to $n_s-1\,=\,8$, to then relax to
a more gentle growth with $n_s-1\,\lesssim\,3$ towards its peak, in agreement with the results
found in previous literature. For scales following the peak associated with the presence of the
non-attractor phase, the spectrum amplitude then mildly decays, during a transitional stage from
non-attractor back to attractor evolution. Our analysis indicates that this gradient approach
offers a transparent understanding of the contributions controlling the slope of the curvature
spectrum. As an application of our findings, we characterise the slope in frequency of a stochastic
gravitational wave background generated at second order from curvature fluctuations, using the
more accurate information we gained on the shape of curvature power spectrum.
