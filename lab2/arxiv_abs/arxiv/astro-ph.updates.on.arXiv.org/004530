The sample of 566 molecular clouds identified in the CO(2--1) IRAM survey covering the disk of M~33
is explored in detail.The clouds were found using CPROPS and were subsequently catalogued in terms
of their star-forming properties as non-star-forming (A), with embedded star formation (B), or
with exposed star formation C.We find that the size-linewidth relation among the M~33 clouds is
quite weak but, when comparing with clouds in other nearby galaxies, the linewidth scales with average
metallicity.The linewidth and particularly the line brightness decrease with galactocentric
distance.The large number of clouds makes it possible to calculate well-sampled cloud mass spectra
and mass spectra of subsamples.As noted earlier, but considerably better defined here, the mass
spectrum steepens (i.e. higher fraction of small clouds) with galactocentric distance.A new finding
is that the mass spectrum of A clouds is much steeper than that of the star-forming clouds.Further
dividing the sample, this difference is strong at both large and small galactocentric distances
and the A vs C difference is a stronger effect than the inner/outer disk difference in mass spectra.Velocity
gradients are identified in the clouds using standard techniques.The gradients are weak and are
dominated by prograde rotation; the effect is stronger for the high signal-to-noise clouds.A discussion
of the uncertainties is presented.The angular momenta are low but compatible with at least some
simulations.The cloud and galactic gradients are similar; the cloud rotation periods are much
longer than cloud lifetimes and comparable to the galactic rotation period.The rotational kinetic
energy is 1-2\% of the gravitational potential energy and the cloud edge velocity is well below the
escape velocity, such that cloud-scale rotation probably has little influence on the evolution
of molecular clouds.
