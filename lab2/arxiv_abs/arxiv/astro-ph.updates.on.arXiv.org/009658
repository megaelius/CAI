Following the historical observations of GW170817 and its multi-wavelength afterglow, more radio
afterglows from neutron star mergers are expected in the future as counterparts to gravitational
wave inspiral signals. We wish to describe these events using our current knowledge of the intrinsic
population of neutron star mergers coming from gamma-ray burst science, and taking into account
the sensitivities of current and future gravitational wave and radio detectors. This is done by
coupling a semi-analytical model for the jet-dominated radio afterglow from a neutron star merger,
an analytical simplified model for the gravitational wave signal from such events, and a population
model prescribing the energetics, external density and other relevant parameters of the mergers.
We report the expected distributions of observables (distance, orientation, afterglow peak time
and flux, etc.) from future events and study how these can be used to further probe the population
of binary neutron stars, their mergers and related outflows during future observing campaigns.
In the case of the O3 run of the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration, the radio afterglow of one third of gravitational-wave-detected
mergers should be detectable--and detected if the source is localized thanks to the kilonova counterpart--by
the Very Large Array, and these events should have viewing angles similar to that of GW170817. These
findings confirm the radio afterglow as a powerful insight on these events, though some key afterglow-related
techniques--such as Very Long Base Interferometry imaging of the merger remnant--may no longer
be possible as the gravitational wave horizon increases.
