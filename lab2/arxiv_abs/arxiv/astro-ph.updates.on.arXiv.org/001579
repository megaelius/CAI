We consider a non-rotating, massive test particle acted upon by a "pressure"-type, non-geodesic
acceleration arising from a certain general class of gravitational theories with nonminimal coupling
between the matter and the metric. The resulting orbital perturbations for a two-body system are
investigated both analytically and numerically. Among the other long-term effects, a secular
increase of the two-body relative distance occurs. In principle, it may yield a physical mechanism
for the steady recession of the Earth from the Sun recently proposed to explain the Faint Young Sun
Paradox in the Archean eon. At present, the theorists have not yet derived explicit expressions
for some of the key parameters of the model, such as the integrated "charge" $\xi$, depending on the
matter distribution of the system, and the 4-vector $K^{\mu}=\{K^0,\boldsymbol{K}\}$ connected
with the nonminimal function $F$. Thus, we phenomenologically treat them as free parameters, and
preliminarily infer some indications on their admissible values according to the most recent Solar
System's planetary ephemerides. From the latest determinations of the corrections $\Delta\dot\varpi$
to the standard perihelion precessions, estimated by the astronomers who produced the EPM2011
ephemerides without modeling the theory considered here, we preliminarily obtain $|\xi K|\lesssim
0.1$ kg s$^{-1}$ for Mars. From guesses on what could be the current bounds on the secular rates of
change of the planetary semimajor axes, we get $|\xi K^0|\lesssim 1249$ kg s$^{-1}$ for Mars. More
effective constraints could be posed by reprocessing the same planetary data sets with dedicated
dynamical models including the effects studied here, and explicitly estimating the associated
parameters. COBE and GP-B terrestrial satellites yield $|\xi K|\lesssim 2\times 10^{-4}$ kg s$^{-1}$
and $|\xi K_0|\lesssim 2\times 10^{-10}$ kg s$^{-1}$.
