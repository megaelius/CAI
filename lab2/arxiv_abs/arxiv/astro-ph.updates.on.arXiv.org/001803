We present a new method to obtain stellar properties for stars exhibiting solar-like oscillations
in an easy, fast, and transparent way. The method, called Asteroseismology Made Easy (AME), can
determine stellar masses, mean-densities, radii, and surface gravities, as well as estimate ages.
In this writing we present AME as a visual and powerful tool which could be useful; in particular in
the light of the large number of exoplanets being found. AME consists of a set of figures from which
the stellar parameters are deduced. These figures are made from a grid of stellar evolutionary models
that cover masses ranging from 0.7 Msun to 1.6 Msun in steps of 0.1 Msun and metallicities in the interval
-0.3 dex <= [Fe/H] <= +0.3 dex in increments of 0.1 dex. The stellar evolutionary models are
computed using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code with simple input
physics. We have compared the results from AME with results for three groups of stars; stars with
radii determined from interferometry (and measured parallaxes), stars with radii determined
from measurements of their parallaxes (and calculated angular diameters), and stars with results
based on the modelling of their individual oscillation frequencies. We find that a comparison of
the radii from interferometry to those from AME yield a weighted mean of the fractional differences
of just 2%. This is also the level of deviation that we find when we compare the parallax-based radii
to the radii determined from AME. The comparison between independently determined stellar parameters
and those found using AME show that our method can provide reliable stellar masses, radii, and ages,
with median uncertainties in the order of 4%, 2%, and 25% respectively.
