We perform a multiwavelength study toward the SNR G18.1-0.1 and nearby several HII regions (infrared
dust bubbles N21 and N22, and the HII regions G018.149-00.283 and G18.197-00.181). Our goal is to
provide observational evidence supporting that massive stars usually born in clusters from the
same molecular cloud, which then produce, along their evolution, different neighboring objects
such as HII regions, interstellar bubbles and supernova remnants. We suggest that the objects analysed
in this work belong to a same complex located at the distance of about 4 kpc. Using molecular data we
inspected the interstellar medium toward this complex and from optical and X-ray observations
we looked for OB-type stars in the region. Analysing public 13CO J=1--0 data we found several molecular
structures very likely related to the HII region/SNR complex. We suggest that the molecular gas
is very likely being swept and shaped by the expansion of the HII regions. From spectroscopic optical
observations obtained with the 2.15 m telescope at CASLEO, Argentina, we discovered three O-type
stars very likely exciting the bubbles N21 and N22, and an uncatalogued HII region northward bubble
N22, respectively. Also we found four B0-5 stars, one toward the bubble N22 and the others within
the HII region G18.149-0.283. By inspecting the Chandra Source Catalog we found two point X-ray
sources and we suggest that one of them is an early O-type star. Finally we inspected the large scale
interstellar medium around this region. We discovered a big molecular shell of about 70 pc x 28 pc
in which the analysed complex appears to be located in its southern border.
