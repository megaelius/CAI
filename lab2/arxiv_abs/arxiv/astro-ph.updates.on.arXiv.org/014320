Recent improvements in data collection volume from planetary and space physics missions have allowed
the application of novel data science techniques. The Cassini mission for example collected over
600 gigabytes of scientific data from 2004 to 2017. This represents a surge of data on the Saturn system.
Machine learning can help scientists work with data on this larger scale. Unlike many applications
of machine learning, a primary use in planetary space physics applications is to infer behavior
about the system itself. This raises three concerns: first, the performance of the machine learning
model, second, the need for interpretable applications to answer scientific questions, and third,
how characteristics of spacecraft data change these applications. In comparison to these concerns,
uses of black box or un-interpretable machine learning methods tend toward evaluations of performance
only either ignoring the underlying physical process or, less often, providing misleading explanations
for it. We build off a previous effort applying a semi-supervised physics-based classification
of plasma instabilities in Saturn's magnetosphere. We then use this previous effort in comparison
to other machine learning classifiers with varying data size access, and physical information
access. We show that incorporating knowledge of these orbiting spacecraft data characteristics
improves the performance and interpretability of machine learning methods, which is essential
for deriving scientific meaning. Building on these findings, we present a framework on incorporating
physics knowledge into machine learning problems targeting semi-supervised classification
for space physics data in planetary environments. These findings present a path forward for incorporating
physical knowledge into space physics and planetary mission data analyses for scientific discovery.
