The MIT-led Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has a goal of detecting terrestrial-mass
planets orbiting stars bright enough for mass determination via ground-based radial velocity
observations. Here we present estimates of how many exoplanets the TESS mission will detect, physical
properties of the detected planets, and the properties of the stars that those planets orbit. This
work uses stars drawn from the TESS Input Catalog Candidate Target List and revises yields from prior
studies that were based on Galactic models. We model the TESS observing strategy to select approximately
200,000 stars at 2-minute cadence, while the remaining stars are observed at 30-min cadence in full-frame
image data. We place zero or more planets in orbit around each star, with physical properties following
measured exoplanet occurrence rates, and use the TESS noise model to predict the derived properties
of the detected exoplanets. In the TESS 2-minute cadence mode we estimate that TESS will find 1250+/-70
exoplanets (90% confidence), including 250 smaller than 2 Earth-radii. Furthermore, we predict
an additional 3200 planets will be found in full-frame image data orbiting bright dwarf stars and
more than 10,000 around fainter stars. We predict that TESS will find 500 planets orbiting M-dwarfs,
but the majority of planets will orbit stars larger than the Sun. Our simulated sample of planets
contains hundreds of small planets amenable to radial velocity follow-up, potentially more than
tripling the number of planets smaller than 4 Earth-radii with mass measurements. This sample of
simulated planets is available for use in planning follow-up observations and analyses.
