GALAH is a large-scale magnitude-limited southern stellar spectroscopic survey. Buder et al.
provide values of stellar parameters and abundances of 23 elements for 342,682 stars. Here we add
a description of the public release of radial velocities with a typical accuracy of 0.1 km/s for 199,628
of these stars. This accuracy is achievable due to the large wavelength coverage, high resolving
power and good signal to noise ratio of the observed spectra, but also because effects that are often
neglected, such as 3-dimensional convective motions in stellar atmosphere, and gravitational
redshift along the light-path from the star to the observer are taken into account. We do not compare
observed and synthetic spectra directly, but we add an intermediate step in which medians of observed
spectra with virtually identical values of stellar parameters are derived. These observed medians
are nearly noiseless, as they are obtained from between 103 and 2276 observed spectra belonging
to the same bin of stellar parameter values with a width of 50 K in temperature, 0.2 dex in gravity,
and 0.1 dex in metallicity. Hence we are publicly releasing also a library of 1277 median spectra,
which trace the well-populated regions of the HR diagram for stars with metallicity between -0.6
and +0.3. Our results are used to check the radial velocities of six observed open clusters. The GALAH
radial velocities are complementary to Gaia DR2, in terms of magnitude coverage, sample size and
accuracy. They are an excellent match to the accuracy of velocity components along the sky plane
derived by Gaia for the same stars. They can be used to study dynamics within stellar clusters, associations
and streams in the Galaxy. This may have important applications for studies of the distribution
of dark matter. The library of medians of observed spectra will be useful as a reference set in the
visible range.
