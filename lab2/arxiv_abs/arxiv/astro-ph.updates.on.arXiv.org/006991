[Abridged] We unveil the complex shape of a proto-supercluster at z~2.45 in the COSMOS field using
the spectroscopic redshifts of the VIMOS Ultra-Deep Survey (VUDS), complemented by the zCOSMOS-Deep
sample and high-quality photometric redshifts. The method relies on a 2D Voronoi tessellation
in overlapping redshift slices that is converted into a 3D density field. The galaxy distribution
is constructed using a statistical treatment of spectroscopic and photometric redshifts. We identify
a proto-supercluster, dubbed "Hyperion" for its immense size and mass, which extends over a volume
of ~60x60x150 comoving Mpc^3 and has an estimated total mass of ~4.8x 10^15 M_sun. This immensely
complex structure contains at least 7 density peaks within 2.4 < z < 2.5, connected by filaments.
Based on the peaks average matter density, we estimate their total mass, M_tot, and find a range of
masses from ~0.1x10^14 M_sun to ~2.7x10^14 M_sun. By using spectroscopic members of each peak,
we obtain the velocity dispersion of the galaxies in the peaks, and then their virial mass M_vir (under
the strong assumption that they are virialised). The agreement between M_vir and M_tot is surprisingly
good, considering that almost all the peaks are probably not yet virialised. According to the spherical
collapse model, the peaks have already started or are about to start collapsing, and they are all
predicted to be virialised by redshift z~0.8-1.6. We finally perform a careful comparison with
the literature, given that smaller components of this proto-supercluster had previously been
identified using heterogeneous galaxy samples. With VUDS, we obtain a panoramic view of this large
structure, that encompasses, connects, and considerably expands in a homogeneous way on all previous
detections of the various sub-components. This provides us the unique possibility to study a rich
supercluster in formation.
