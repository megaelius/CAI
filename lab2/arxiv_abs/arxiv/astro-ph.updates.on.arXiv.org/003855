We present spatially resolved stellar kinematic maps, for the first time, for a sample of 17 intermediate
redshift galaxies (0.2 < z < 0.8). We used deep MUSE/VLT integral field spectroscopic observations
in the Hubble Deep Field South (HDFS) and Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), resulting from ~30h integration
time per field, each covering 1'x1' field of view, with ~0.65" spatial resolution. We selected all
galaxies brighter than 25mag in the I band and for which the stellar continuum is detected over an
area that is at least two times larger than the spatial resolution. The resulting sample contains
mostly late-type disk, main-sequence star-forming galaxies with 10^8.5 - 10^10.5 Msun. Using
a full-spectrum fitting technique, we derive two-dimensional maps of the stellar and gas kinematics,
including the radial velocity V and velocity dispersion sigma. We find that most galaxies in the
sample are consistent with having rotating stellar disks with roughly constant velocity dispersions
and that the Vrms=sqrt{V^2+sigma^2} of the gas and stars, a scaling proxy for the galaxy gravitational
potential, compare well to each other. These spatially resolved observations of intermediate
redshift galaxies suggest that the regular stellar kinematics of disk galaxies that is observed
in the local Universe was already in place 4 - 7 Gyr ago and that their gas kinematics traces the gravitational
potential of the galaxy, thus is not dominated by shocks and turbulent motions. Finally, we build
dynamical axisymmetric Jeans models constrained by the derived stellar kinematics for two specific
galaxies and derive their dynamical masses. These are in good agreement (within 25%) with those
derived from simple exponential disk models based on the gas kinematics. The obtained mass-to-light
ratios hint towards dark matter dominated systems within a few effective radii.
