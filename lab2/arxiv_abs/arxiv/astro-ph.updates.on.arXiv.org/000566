In this paper an extensive survey of the star forming complex Sh2-252 has been undertaken with an
aim to explore its hidden young stellar population as well as to understand the structure and star
formation history. This complex is composed of five embedded clusters associated with the sub-regions
A, C, E, NGC 2175s and Teu 136. Using 2MASS-NIR and Spitzer-IRAC, MIPS photometry we identified 577
young stellar objects (YSOs), of which, 163 are Class I, 400 are Class II and 14 are transition disk
YSOs. Spatial distribution of the candidate YSOs shows that they are mostly clustered around the
sub-regions in the western half of the complex, suggesting enhanced star formation activity towards
its west. Using the spectral energy distribution and optical colour-magnitude diagram based age
analyses, we derived probable evolutionary status of the sub-regions of Sh2-252. Our analysis
shows that the region A is the youngest (~ 0.5 Myr), the regions B, C and E are of similar evolutionary
stage (~ 1-2 Myr) and the clusters NGC 2175s and Teu 136 are slightly evolved (~ 2-3 Myr). Morphology
of the region in the 1.1 mm map shows a semi-circular shaped molecular shell composed of several clumps
and YSOs bordering the western ionization front of Sh2-252. Our analyses suggest that next generation
star formation is currently under way along this border and that possibly fragmentation of the matter
collected during the expansion of the HII region as one of the major processes responsible for such
stars. We observed the densest concentration of YSOs (mostly Class I, ~ 0.5 Myr) at the western outskirts
of the complex, within a molecular clump associated with water and methanol masers and we suggest
that it is indeed a site of cluster formation at a very early evolutionary stage, sandwiched between
the two relatively evolved CHII regions A and B.
