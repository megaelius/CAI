In a strongly stratified turbulent layer, a uniform horizontal magnetic field can become unstable
to spontaneously form local flux concentrations due to a negative contribution of turbulence to
the large-scale (mean-field) magnetic pressure. This mechanism, called the negative effective
magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI), is of interest in connection with dynamo scenarios where
most of the magnetic field resides in the bulk of the convection zone, and not at the bottom. Recent
work using the mean-field hydromagnetic equations has shown that NEMPI becomes suppressed at rather
low rotation rates with Coriolis numbers as low as 0.1.}{Here we extend these earlier investigations
by studying the effects of rotation both on the development of NEMPI and on the effective magnetic
pressure. We also quantify the kinetic helicity from direct numerical simulations (DNS) and compare
with earlier work.}{To calculate the rotational effect on the effective magnetic pressure we consider
both DNS and analytical studies using the $\tau$ approach. To study the effects of rotation on the
development of NEMPI we use both DNS and mean-field calculations of the 3D hydromagnetic equations
in a Cartesian domain.}{We find that the growth rates of NEMPI from earlier mean-field calculations
are well reproduced with DNS, provided the Coriolis number is below about 0.06. In that case, kinetic
and magnetic helicities are found to be weak. For faster rotation, dynamo action becomes possible.
However, there is an intermediate range of rotation rates where dynamo action on its own is not yet
possible, but the rotational suppression of NEMPI is being alleviated.}{Production of magnetic
flux concentrations through the suppression of turbulent pressure appears to be possible only
in the upper-most layers of the Sun, where the convective turnover time is less than 2 hours.}
