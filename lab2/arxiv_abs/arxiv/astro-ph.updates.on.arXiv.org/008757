Streaming instability is a key mechanism in planet formation, clustering pebbles into planetesimals.
It is triggered at a particular disk location where the local volume density of solids exceeds that
of the gas. After their formation, planetesimals can grow by feeding from other planetesimals in
the birth ring as well as by accreting inwardly drifting pebbles from the outer disk. To investigate
the growth of planetesimals at a single location by the streaming instability, we test the conditions
under which super-Earths are able to form within the lifetime of the gaseous disk. We modify the \texttt{Mercury}
N-body code to trace the growth and dynamical evolution of a swarm of planetesimals at the ice line
for a solar-mass star. Three distributions of planetesimal sizes are investigated: (i) a mono-dispersed
population of 400 km radius planetesimals, (ii) a poly-dispersed populations of planetesimals
from 200 km up to 1000 km, (iii) a bimodal distribution with a single runaway body and a swarm of smaller,
100 km size planetesimals. The mono-disperse population of 400 km size planetesimals cannot form
$\gtrsim$ Earth mass protoplanets. Their velocity dispersions are quickly excited, which suppresses
both planetesimal and pebble accretion. Planets can form from the poly-dispersed and bimodal distributions.
In these circumstances, the two-component nature damps the random velocity of the large embryo
by small planetesimals' dynamical friction, allowing the embryo to accrete pebbles efficiently
when it approaches $10^{-2}$ Earth mass. We find that super-Earth planets are preferred to form
when the pebble mass flux is higher, the disk turbulence is lower, or the Stokes number of the pebbles
is higher.
