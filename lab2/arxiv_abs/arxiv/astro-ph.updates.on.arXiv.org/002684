The large-scale magnetic field of solar-type stars reconstructed from their spectropolarimetric
observations provide important insight into their underlying dynamo processes.We aim to investigate
the temporal variability of the large-scale surface magnetic field and chromospheric activity
of a young solar analogue, the G0 dwarf HN Peg.The large-scale surface magnetic field topology is
reconstructed using Zeeman Doppler Imaging at six observational epochs covering seven years.We
also investigated the chromospheric activity variations by measuring the flux in the line cores
of the three chromospheric activity indicators: Ca II H&K, H alpha, and the Ca II IRT lines.The
magnetic topology of HN Peg shows a complex and variable geometry. While the radial field exhibits
a stable positive polarity magnetic region at the poles at each observational epoch, the azimuthal
field is strongly variable in strength, where a strong band of positive polarity magnetic field
is present at equatorial latitudes. This field disappears during the middle of our time span, reappearing
again during the last two epochs of observations. The mean magnetic field derived from the magnetic
maps also follow a similar trend to the toroidal field, with the field strength at a minimum in epoch
2009.54. Summing the line of sight magnetic field over the visible surface at each observation,
HN Peg exhibits a weak longitudinal magnetic field ranging from -14 G to 13 G, with no significant
long-term trend, although there is significant rotational variability within each epoch. Those
chromospheric activity indicators exhibit more long-term variations over the time span of observations,
where the minimal is observed in Epoch 2008.71.
