A large arcade flare of 2 March 1993 has been investigated using X-ray observations recorded by the
{\sl Yohkoh} and GOES satellites and the {\sl Compton Gamma Ray Observatory}. We analyzed quasi-periodicity
of the hard-X-ray (HXR) pulses in the flare impulsive phase and found close similarity between the
quasi-periodic sequence of the pulses with that observed in another large arcade flare of 2 November
1991. This similarity helped to explain the strong HXR pulses which were recorded at the end of the
impulsive phase, as due to an inflow of dense plasma (coming from the chromospheric evaporation)
into the acceleration volume inside the cusp. In HXR images a high flaring loop was seen with a triangular
cusp structure at the top, where the electrons were efficiently accelerated. The sequence of HXR
images allowed us to investigate complicated changes in the precipitation of the accelerated electrons
toward the flare footpoints. We have shown that all these impulsive-phase observations can be easily
explained in terms of the model of electron acceleration in oscillating magnetic traps located
within the cusp structure. Some soft-X-ray (SXR) images were available for the late decay phase.
They show a long arcade of SXR loops. Important information about the evolution of the flare during
the slow decay phase is contained in the time variation of the temperature, $T(t)$, and emission
measure, EM$(t)$. This information is the following: i) weak heating occurs during the slow decay
phase and it slowly decreases; ii) the decrease in the heating determines slow and smooth decrease
in EM; iii) the coupling between the heating and the amount of the hot plasma makes the flare evolve
along a sequence of quasi-steady states during the slow decay phase (QSS evolution).
