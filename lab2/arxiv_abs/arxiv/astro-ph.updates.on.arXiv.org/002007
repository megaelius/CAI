We measure the effective optical depth of HeII Ly\alpha\ absorption \tau$_\mathsf{eff,HeII}$
at 2.3<z<3.5 in 17 UV-transmitting quasars observed with UV spectrographs on the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST). The median \tau$_\mathsf{eff,HeII}$ values increase gradually from 2.05
at z=2.7 to 4.27 at z=3.16, but with a strong sightline-to-sightline variance. Many $\simeq$35
comoving Mpc regions of the z>3 intergalactic medium (IGM) remain transmissive (\tau$_\mathsf{eff,HeII}$<4),
and the gradual trend with redshift appears consistent with density evolution of a fully reionized
IGM. These modest optical depths imply average HeII fractions of x$_\mathsf{HeII}\simeq$0.003
and ionizing photon mean free paths of $\simeq$50 comoving Mpc at z$\simeq$3.4, thus requiring
that a substantial volume of the helium in the Universe was already doubly ionized at early times,
in conflict with current models of HeII reionization driven by luminous quasars. Along 10 sightlines
we measure the coeval HI Ly\alpha\ effective optical depths, allowing us to study the density dependence
of \tau$_\mathsf{eff,HeII}$ at z$\sim$3. We establish that: (1) the dependence of \tau$_\mathsf{eff,HeII}$
on increasing \tau$_\mathsf{eff,HI}$ is significantly shallower than expected from simple models
of an IGM reionized in HeII, requiring higher HeII photoionization rates in overdense regions,
(2) there are very large fluctuations in \tau$_\mathsf{eff,HeII}$ at all \tau$_\mathsf{eff,HI}$,
which greatly exceed the expectations from these simple models. These data present a distinct challenge
to scenarios of HeII reionization - an IGM where HeII appears to be predominantly ionized at z$\simeq$3.4,
and with a radiation field strength that is correlated with the density field, but exhibits large
fluctuations at all densities.
