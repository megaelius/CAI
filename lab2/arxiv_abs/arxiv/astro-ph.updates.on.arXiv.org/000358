We analysed the X-ray spectra of six observations, simultaneously taken with XMM-Newton and Rossi
X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1636-53. The observations
cover several states of the source, and therefore a large range of inferred mass accretion rate.
These six observations show a broad emission line in the spectrum at around 6.5 keV, likely due to
iron. We fitted this line with a set of phenomenological models of a relativistically broadened
line, plus a model that accounts for relativistically smeared and ionised reflection from the accretion
disc. The latter model includes the incident emission from both the neutron-star surface or boundary
layer and the corona that is responsible for the high-energy emission in these systems. From the
fits with the reflection model we found that in four out of the six observations the main contribution
to the reflected spectrum comes from the neutron-star surface or boundary layer, whereas in the
other two observations the main contribution to the reflected spectrum comes from the corona. We
found that the relative contribution of these two components is not correlated to the state of the
source. From the phenomenological models we found that the iron line profile is better described
by a symmetric, albeit broad, profile. The width of the line cannot be explained only by Compton broadening,
and we therefore explored the case of relativistic broadening. We further found that the direct
emission from the disc, boundary layer, and corona generally evolved in a manner consistent with
the standard accretion disc model, with the disc and boundary layer becoming hotter and the disc
moving inwards as the source changed from the hard in to the soft state. The iron line, however, did
not appear to follow the same trend.
