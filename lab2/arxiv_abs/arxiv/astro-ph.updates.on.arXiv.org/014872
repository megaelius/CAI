We present new, near-infrared ($1.1 - 2.4$ $\mu m$) high-contrast imaging of the debris disk around
HD 15115 with the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics system (SCExAO) coupled with the
Coronagraphic High Angular Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (CHARIS). SCExAO/CHARIS resolves
the disk down to $\rho \sim 0.2''$ ($\rm{r_{proj}} \sim 10$ $\rm{au}$), a factor of $\sim 3-5$ smaller
than previous recent studies. We derive a disk position angle of $\rm{PA}$ $\sim 279.4^\circ - 280.5^\circ$
and an inclination of $\rm{i}$ $\sim 85.3^\circ - 86.2^\circ$. While recent SPHERE/IRDIS imagery
of the system could suggest a significantly misaligned two ring disk geometry, CHARIS imagery does
not reveal conclusive evidence for this hypothesis. Moreover, optimizing models of both one and
two ring geometries using differential evolution, we find that a single ring having a Hong-like
scattering phase function matches the data equally well within the CHARIS field of view ($\rho \lesssim
1''$). The disk's asymmetry, well-evidenced at larger separations, is also recovered; the west
side of the disk appears on average around 0.4 magnitudes brighter across the CHARIS bandpass between
$0.25''$ and $1''$. Comparing STIS/50CCD optical photometry ($2000-10500$ $\r{A}$) with CHARIS
NIR photometry, we find a red (STIS/50CCD$-$CHARIS broadband) color for both sides of the disk throughout
the $0.4'' - 1''$ region of overlap, in contrast to the blue color reported at similar wavelengths
for regions exterior to $\sim 2''$. Further, this color may suggest a smaller minimum grain size
than previously estimated at larger separations. Finally, we provide constraints on planetary
companions, and discuss possible mechanisms for the observed inner disk flux asymmetry and color.
