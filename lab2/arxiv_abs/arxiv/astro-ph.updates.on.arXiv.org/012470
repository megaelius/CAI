Useful information can be retrieved by analysing the transit light curve of a planet-hosting star
or induced radial velocity oscillations. However, inferring the physical parameters of the planet,
such as mass, size, and semi-major axis, requires preliminary knowledge of some parameters of the
host star, especially its mass or radius, which are generally inferred through theoretical evolutionary
models. We seek to present and test a whole algorithm devoted to the complete characterisation of
an exoplanetary system thanks to the global analysis of photometric or radial velocity time series
combined with observational stellar parameters derived either from spectroscopy or photometry.
We developed an integrated tool called MCMCI. This tool combines the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
approach of analysing photometric or radial velocity time series with a proper interpolation within
stellar evolutionary isochrones and tracks, known as isochrone placement, to be performed at each
chain step, to retrieve stellar theoretical parameters such as age, mass, and radius. We tested
the MCMCI on the HD 219134 multi-planetary system hosting two transiting rocky super Earths and
on WASP-4, which hosts a bloated hot Jupiter. Even considering different input approaches, a final
convergence was reached within the code, we found good agreement with the results already stated
in the literature and we obtained more precise output parameters, especially concerning planetary
masses. The MCMCI tool offers the opportunity to perform an integrated analysis of an exoplanetary
system without splitting it into the preliminary stellar characterisation through theoretical
models. Rather this approach favours a close interaction between light curve analysis and isochrones,
so that the parameters recovered at each step of the MCMC enter as inputs for purposes of isochrone
placement.
