We discuss axion dark matter detection via two mechanisms: spontaneous decays and resonant conversion
in neutron star magnetospheres. For decays, we show that the brightness temperature signal, rather
than flux, is a less ambiguous measure for selecting candidate objects. This is owing principally
to the finite beam width of telescopes which prevents one from being sensitive to the total flux from
the object. With this in mind, we argue that the large surface-mass-density of the galactic centre
or the Virgo cluster centre offers the best chance of improving current constraints on the axion-photon
coupling via spontaneous decays. For the neutron star case, we first carry out a detailed study of
mixing in magnetised plasmas. We derive transport equations for the axion-photon system via a controlled
gradient expansion, allowing us to address inhomogeneous mass-shell constraints for arbitrary
momenta. We then derive a non-perturbative Landau-Zener formula for the conversion probability
valid across the range of relativistic and non-relativistic axions and show that the standard perturbative
resonant conversion amplitude is a truncation of this result in the non-adiabatic limit. Our treatment
reveals that that infalling dark matter axions typically convert non-adiabatically in magnetospheres.
We describe the limitations of one-dimensional mixing equations and explain how three-dimensional
effects activate new photon polarisations, including longitudinal modes and illustrate these
arguments with numerical simulations in higher dimensions. We find that the bandwidth of the radio
signal is dominated by Doppler broadening from the relative motion of the neutron star with respect
to the observer. Therefore, we conclude that the radio sensitivity to the resonant decay is weaker
than previously thought, which means one relies on local density peaks to probe weaker axion-photon
couplings.
