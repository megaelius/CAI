ALMA has observed a plethora of ring-like structures in planet forming discs at distances of 10-100
au from their host star. Although several mechanisms have been invoked to explain the origin of such
rings, a common explanation is that they trace new-born planets. Under the planetary hypothesis,
a natural question is how to reconcile the apparently high frequency of gap-carving planets at 10-100
au with the paucity of Jupiter mass planets observed around main sequence stars at those separations.
Here, we provide an analysis of the new-born planet population emerging from observations of gaps
in discs, under the assumption that the observed gaps are due to planets. We use a simple estimate
of the planet mass based on the gap morphology, and apply it to a sample of gaps recently obtained by
us in a survey of Taurus with ALMA. We also include additional data from recent published surveys,
thus analysing the largest gap sample to date, for a total of 48 gaps. The properties of the purported
planets occupy a distinctively different region of parameter space with respect to the known exo-planet
population, currently not accessible through planet finding methods. Thus, no discrepancy in
the mass and radius distribution of the two populations can be claimed at this stage. We show that
the mass of the inferred planets conforms to the theoretically expected trend for the minimum planet
mass needed to carve a dust gap. Finally, we estimate the separation and mass of the putative planets
after accounting for migration and accretion, for a range of evolutionary times, finding a good
match with the distribution of cold Jupiters.
