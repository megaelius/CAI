We investigate the merger histories of isolated dwarf galaxies based on a suite of 15 high-resolution
cosmological zoom-in simulations, all with masses of $M_{\rm halo} \approx 10^{10}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$
(and M$_\star\sim10^5-10^7\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$) at $z=0$, from the Feedback in Realistic Environments
(FIRE) project. The stellar populations of these dwarf galaxies at $z=0$ are formed essentially
entirely "in situ": over 90$\%$ of the stellar mass is formed in the main progenitor in all but two
cases, and all 15 of the galaxies have >70$\%$ of their stellar mass formed in situ. Virtually all
galaxy mergers occur prior to $z\sim3$, meaning that accreted stellar populations are ancient.
On average, our simulated dwarfs undergo 5 galaxy mergers in their lifetimes, with typical pre-merger
galaxy mass ratios that are less than 1:10. This merger frequency is generally comparable to what
has been found in dissipationless simulations when coupled with abundance matching. Two of the
simulated dwarfs have a luminous satellite companion at $z=0$. These ultra-faint dwarfs lie at
or below current detectability thresholds but are intriguing targets for next-generation facilities.
The small contribution of accreted stars make it extremely difficult to discern the effects of mergers
in the vast majority of dwarfs either photometrically or using resolved-star color-magnitude
diagrams (CMDs). The important implication for near-field cosmology is that star formation histories
of comparably massive galaxies derived from resolved CMDs should trace the build-up of stellar
mass in one main system across cosmic time as opposed to reflecting the contributions of many individual
star formation histories of merged dwarfs.
