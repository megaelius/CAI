The recent discovery of the neutron star merger and multi-messenger event GW170817 (also known
as kilonova GRB170817A) provides an unprecedented laboratory in which to study these mysterious
objects, as well as an opportunity to test cutting-edge theories of gravity in the strong field regime.
Before this event, such tests of our understanding of the nature of gravity were not possible. In
this study, we analyze the X-ray observations of GW170817 obtained with NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory
following the 17 August 2017 detection of the event by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave
Observatory (LIGO). Motivated by understanding the emission mechanism for X-ray light and the
outcome of the merger event, we fit the Chandra data with both non-thermal (as done previously in
the literature) and thermal models. We specifically explore thermal plasma models that would be
expected from a kilonova remnant (KNR). We reproduced the non-thermal results which were recently
published by Nynka et al. (2018). We also find that thermal bremsstrahlung emission from hot plasma
can account for the X-ray emission from this source. Furthermore, we consider models allowing for
an intrinsic absorption from the merger event, yielding a softer power-law model photon index than
previously published, or a lower plasma temperature. We also report on evidence for line emission,
or excess above the continuum model, near 1.3 keV and 2.2 keV which sheds new light on the interpretation
of the KNR and its nucleosynthesis products. We discuss the feasibility for the KNR as the origin
for thermal X-ray emission at this stage of the kilonova evolution.
