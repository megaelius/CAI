By obtaining imaging data in two photometric bands for 60 lenticular galaxies - members of 8 southern
clusters - with the Las Cumbres Observatory one-meter telescope network, we have analyzed the structure
of their large-scale stellar disks. The parameters of radial surface-brightness profiles have
been determined (including also disk thickness), and all the galaxies have been classified into
pure exponential (Type I) disk surface-brightness profiles, truncated (Type II) and antitruncated
(Type III) piecewise exponential disk surface-brightness profiles. We confirm the previous results
of some other authors that the proportion of surface-brightness profile types is very different
in environments of different density: in the clusters the Type-II profiles are almost absent while
according to the literature data, in the field they constitute about one quarter of all lenticular
galaxies. The Type-III profiles are equally presented in the clusters and in the field, while following
similar scaling relations; but by undertaking an additional structural analysis including the
disk thickness determination we note that some Type-III disks may be a combination of a rather thick
exponential pseudobulge and an outer Type-I disk. Marginally we detect a shift of the scaling relation
toward higher central surface brightnesses for the outer segments of Type-III disks and smaller
thickness of the Type-I disks in the clusters. Both effects may be explained by enhanced radial stellar
migration during disk galaxy infall into a cluster that in particular represents an additional
channel for Type-I disk shaping in dense environments.
