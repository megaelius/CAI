At the time of formation, protoplanetary discs likely contain a comparable mass to their host protostars.
As a result, gravitational instabilities (GIs) are expected to play a pivotal role in the early phases
of disc evolution. However, as these young objects are heavily embedded, confirmation of GIs has
remained elusive. Therefore, we use the radiative transfer code LIME to produce line images of a
$0.17\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ self-gravitating protosolar-like disc. We note the limitations
of using LIME and explore methods to improve upon the default gridding. We synthesise noiseless
observations to determine the sensitivities required to detect the spiral flux, and find that the
line flux distribution does not necessarily correlate to the abundance density distribution;
hence performing radiative transfer calculations is imperative. Moreover, the spiral features
are seen in absorption, due to the GI-heated midplane and high extinction, which could be indicative
of GI activity. If a small beamsize and appropriate molecular line are used then spatially resolving
spirals in a protosolar-like disc should be possible with ALMA for an on-source time of 30 hr. Spectrally
resolving non-axisymmetric structure takes only a tenth as long for a reasonable noise level, but
attributing this structure to GI-induced activity would be tentative. Finally, we find that identifying
finger-like features in PV diagrams of nearly edge-on discs, which are a direct indicator of spirals,
is feasible with an on-source time of 19 hr, and hence likely offers the most promising means of confirming
GI-driven spiral structure in young, embedded protoplanetary discs.
