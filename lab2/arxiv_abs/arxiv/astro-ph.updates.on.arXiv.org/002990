Population synthesis models of planetary systems developed during the last $\sim$15 years could
reproduce several of the observables of the exoplanet population, and also allowed to constrain
planetary formation models. We present our planet formation model, which calculates the evolution
of a planetary system during the gaseous phase. The code incorporates relevant physical phenomena
for the formation of a planetary system, like photoevaporation, planet migration, gas accretion,
water delivery in embryos and planetesimals, a detailed study of the orbital evolution of the planetesimal
population, and the treatment of the fusion between embryos, considering their atmospheres. The
main goal of this work, unlike other works of planetary population synthesis, is to find suitable
scenarios and physical parameters of the disc to form solar system analogs. We are specially interested
in the final planet distributions, and in the final surface density, eccentricity and inclination
profiles for the planetesimal population. These final distributions will be used as initial conditions
for N-body simulations, to study the post-oligarchic formation in a second work. We then consider
different formation scenarios, with different planetesimal sizes and different type I migration
rates. We find that solar system analogs are favored in massive discs, with low type I migration rates,
and small planetesimal sizes. Besides, those rocky planets within their habitables zones are dry
when discs dissipate. At last, the final configurations of solar system analogs include information
about the mass and semimajor-axis of the planets, water contents, and the properties of the planetesimal
remnants.
