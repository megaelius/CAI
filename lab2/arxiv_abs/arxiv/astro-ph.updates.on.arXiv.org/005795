The main characteristics in the radio continuum spectra of Supernova Remnants (SNRs) result from
simple synchrotron emission. In addition, electron acceleration mechanisms can shape the spectra
in specific ways, especially at high radio frequencies. These features are connected to the age
and the peculiar conditions of the local interstellar medium interacting with the SNR. Whereas
the bulk radio emission is expected at up to $20-50$ GHz, sensitive high-resolution images of SNRs
above 10 GHz are lacking and are not easily achievable, especially in the confused regions of the
Galactic Plane. In the framework of the early science observations with the Sardinia Radio Telescope
in February-March 2016, we obtained high-resolution images of SNRs Tycho, W44 and IC443 that provided
accurate integrated flux density measurements at 21.4 GHz: 8.8 $\pm$ 0.9 Jy for Tycho, 25 $\pm$ 3
Jy for W44 and 66 $\pm$ 7 Jy for IC443. We coupled the SRT measurements with radio data available in
the literature in order to characterise the integrated and spatially-resolved spectra of these
SNRs, and to find significant frequency- and region-dependent spectral slope variations. For
the first time, we provide direct evidence of a spectral break in the radio spectral energy distribution
of W44 at an exponential cutoff frequency of 15 $\pm$ 2 GHz. This result constrains the maximum energy
of the accelerated electrons in the range $6-13$ GeV, in agreement with predictions indirectly
derived from AGILE and \textit{Fermi}-LAT gamma-ray observations. With regard to IC443, our results
confirm the noticeable presence of a bump in the integrated spectrum around $20-70$ GHz that could
result from a spinning dust emission mechanism.
