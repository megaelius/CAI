We use magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way-mass haloes from the Auriga project to
examine the properties of surviving and destroyed dwarf galaxies that are accreted by these haloes
over cosmic time. We show that the combined luminosity function of surviving and destroyed dwarfs
at infall is similar in the various Auriga haloes, and is dominated by the destroyed dwarfs. There
is, however, a strong dependence on infall time: destroyed dwarfs have typically early infall times,
$t_{infall}<6$ Gyr, whereas the majority of dwarfs accreted at $t_{infall}>10$ Gyr have survived
to the present day. Because of their late infall the surviving satellites today had higher metallicites
at infall than their destroyed counterparts of similar infall mass; the difference is even more
pronounced for the present-day metallicites of satellites, many of which continue to form stars
after infall. In agreement with previous work, we find that a small number of relatively massive
destroyed dwarf galaxies dominate the mass of the stellar haloes. However, there is a significant
radial dependence: while 90 per cent of the mass in the inner regions ($<\,20\,$kpc) is contributed,
on average, by only 3 massive progenitors, the outer regions ($>\,100\,$kpc) typically have $\sim8$
main progenitors of relatively lower mass. Finally, we show that a few massive progenitors dominate
the metallicity distribution of accreted stars, even at the metal poor end. Contrary to common assumptions
in the literature, dwarf galaxies of mass $M_{*}<10^7 \, M_{\odot}$ make up less than 10 per cent
of the accreted, metal poor stars ([Fe/H] $<\,-3$) in the inner $50\,$kpc.
