The European Solar Telescope (EST) is a research infrastructure for solar physics. It is planned
to be an on-axis solar telescope with an aperture of 4 m and equipped with an innovative suite of spectro-polarimetric
and imaging post-focus instrumentation. The EST project was initiated and is driven by EAST, the
European Association for Solar Telescopes. EAST was founded in 2006 as an association of 14 European
countries. Today, as of December 2019, EAST consists of 26 European research institutes from 18
European countries. The Preliminary Design Phase of EST was accomplished between 2008 and 2011.
During this phase, in 2010, the first version of the EST Science Requirement Document (SRD) was published.
After EST became a project on the ESFRI roadmap 2016, the preparatory phase started. The goal of the
preparatory phase is to accomplish a final design for the telescope and the legal governance structure
of EST. A major milestone on this path is to revisit and update the Science Requirement Document (SRD).
The EST Science Advisory Group (SAG) has been constituted by EAST and the Board of the PRE-EST EU project
in November 2017 and has been charged with the task of providing with a final statement on the science
requirements for EST. Based on the conceptual design, the SRD update takes into account recent technical
and scientific developments, to ensure that EST provides significant advancement beyond the current
state-of-the-art. The present update of the EST SRD has been developed and discussed during a series
of EST SAG meetings. The SRD develops the top-level science objectives of EST into individual science
cases. Identifying critical science requirements is one of its main goals. Those requirements
will define the capabilities of EST and the post-focus instrument suite. The technical requirements
for the final design of EST will be derived from the SRD.
