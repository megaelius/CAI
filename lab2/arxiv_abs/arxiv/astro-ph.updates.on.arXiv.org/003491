The study of stellar-remnant black holes (BH) in dense stellar clusters is now in the spotlight,
especially due to their intrinsic ability to form binary black holes (BBH) through dynamical encounters,
that potentially coalesce via gravitational-wave (GW) radiation. In this work, which is a continuation
of a recent study (Paper I), additional models of compact stellar clusters with initial masses $\lesssim10^5M_\odot$
and also those with small fractions of primordial binaries ($\lesssim10$%) are evolved for long
term, applying the direct N-body approach, assuming state-of-the-art stellar-wind and remnant-formation
prescriptions. That way, a substantially broader range of computed models than that in Paper I is
achieved. As in Paper I, the general-relativistic BBH mergers continue to be mostly mediated by
triples that are bound to the clusters rather than happen among the ejected BBHs. In fact, the number
of such in situ BBH mergers, per cluster, tend to increase significantly with the introduction of
a small population of primordial binaries. Despite the presence of massive primordial binaries,
the merging BBHs, especially the in situ ones, are found to be exclusively dynamically assembled
and hence would be spin-orbit misaligned. The BBHs typically traverse through both the LISA's and
the LIGO's detection bands, being audible to both instruments. The "dynamical heating" of the BHs
keeps the Electron-Capture-Supernova (ECS) neutron stars (NS) from effectively mass segregating
and participating in exchange interactions; the dynamically-active BHs would also exchange into
any NS binary within $\lesssim1$ Gyr. Such young massive and open clusters have the potential to
contribute to the dynamical BBH merger detection rate to a similar extent as their more massive globular-cluster
counterparts.
