It is now well-established that most (if not all) ancient globular clusters host multiple popula-
tions, that are characterised by distinct chemical features such as helium abundance variations
along with N-C and Na-O anti-correlations, at fixed [Fe/H]. These very distinct chemical fea- tures
are similar to what is found in the centres of the massive early-type galaxies and may influence measurements
of the global properties of the galaxies. Additionally, recent results have suggested that M/L
variations found in the centres of massive early-type galaxies might be due to a bottom-heavy stellar
initial mass function. We present an analysis of the effects of globular cluster-like multiple
populations on the integrated properties of early-type galaxies. In particular, we focus on spectral
features in the integrated optical spectrum and the global mass-to-light ratio that have been used
to infer variations in the stellar initial mass function. To achieve this we develop appropriate
stellar population synthesis models and take into account, for the first time, an initial-final
mass relation which takes into consideration a varying He abundance. We conclude that while the
multiple populations may be present in massive early-type galaxies, they are likely not responsible
for the observed variations in the mass- to-light ratio and IMF sensitive line strengths. Finally,
we estimate the fraction of stars with multiple populations chemistry that come from disrupted
globular clusters within massive ellipticals and find that they may explain some of the observed
chemical patterns in the centres of these galaxies.
