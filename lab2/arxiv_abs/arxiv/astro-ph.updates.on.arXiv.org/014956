Detecting neutral hydrogen structures in the intergalactic medium (IGM) during cosmic reionization
via absorption (21 cm forest) against a background radiation is considered independent and complementary
to the three-dimensional tomography and power spectrum techniques. The direct detection of this
absorption requires very bright ($\gtrsim 10$-100 mJy) background sources at high redshifts ($z\gtrsim
8$), which are evidently rare; very long times of integration; or instruments of very high sensitivity.
This motivates a statistical one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum approach along narrow sightlines
but with fainter background objects ($\sim 1$-10 mJy), which are likely to be more abundant and significant
contributors at high redshifts. The 1D power spectrum reduces cosmic variance and improves sensitivity
especially on small spatial scales. Using standard radiative transfer and fiducial models for
the instrument, the background sources, and the evolution of IGM structures during cosmic reionization,
the potential of the 1D power spectrum along selected narrow directions is investigated against
uncertainties from thermal noise and the chromatic synthesized point spread function (PSF) response.
Minimum requirements on the number of high-redshift background sources, the telescope sensitivity,
and the PSF quality are estimated for a range of instrumental, background source, and reionization
model parameters. The 1D power spectrum is intrinsically stronger at higher redshifts. A $\sim
1000$ hr observing campaign targeting $\sim 100$ narrow sightlines to radio-faint, high-redshift
background objects with modern radio telescopes, especially the Square Kilometre Array, can detect
the 1D power spectrum on a range of spatial scales and redshifts, and potentially discriminate between
models of cosmic reionization.
