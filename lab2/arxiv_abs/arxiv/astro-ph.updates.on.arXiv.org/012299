The stellar mass assembly of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) is still debated. We have observed
in CO with the IRAM-30m two star forming BCGs belonging to SpARCS clusters, 3C 244.1 ($z=0.4$) and
SDSS J161112.65+550823.5 ($z=0.9$), and compared their molecular gas and star formation properties
with those of a compilation of $\sim100$ distant cluster galaxies, including nine additional distant
BCGs at ${z\sim0.4-3.5}$. We have set robust upper limits of $M_{{\rm H}_2}<1.0\times10^{10}~M_\odot$
and $<2.8\times10^{10}~M_\odot$ to their molecular gas content, respectively, as well as to the
molecular gas to stellar mass ratio $M({\rm H}_2)/M_\star\lesssim0.2$ and depletion time $\tau_{\rm
dep}\lesssim40$ Myr of the two targeted BCGs. They are thus among the distant cluster galaxies with
the lowest gas fractions and shortest depletion times. The majority, $64\%\pm15\%$ and $73\%\pm18\%$,
of the 11 BCGs with observations in CO have lower $M({\rm H}_2)/M_\star$ and $\tau_{\rm dep}$, respectively,
than those estimated for main sequence galaxies. Statistical analysis tentatively suggests that
the values of $M({\rm H}_2)/M_\star$ and $\tau_{\rm dep}$ for the 11 BCGs deviates, with a significance
of $\sim2\sigma$, from those of the comparison sample of cluster galaxies. A morphological analysis
for a subsample of seven BCGs with archival HST observations reveals that $71\%\pm17\%$ of the BCGs
are compact or show star-forming substructures/components. Our results suggest a scenario where
distant star forming BCGs assemble a significant fraction $\sim16\%$ of their stellar mass in the
relatively short timescale $\tau_{\rm dep}$, while environmental mechanisms might prevent the
replenishment of gas feeding the star formation. We speculate that compact components favor the
rapid exhaustion of molecular gas and help to quench the BCGs. Distant star forming BCGs are excellent
targets for ALMA and JWST.
