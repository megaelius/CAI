In the present work we utilise the most recent publicly available SN Ia compilations and implement
a well formulated cosmological model based on LTB metric in presence of cosmological constant $\Lambda$
($\Lambda$LTB) to test for signatures of large local inhomogeneities at $z \leq 0.15$. Local underdensities
in this redshift range have been previously found based on luminosity density data and galaxy number
counts. Our main constraints on the possible local void using the Pantheon SN Ia dataset are - redshift
size of $z_{\rm size}=0.068^{+0.021}_{-0.030}$ and density contrast of $\delta\Omega_0/\Omega_0
= -10.5_{-7.4}^{+9.3}\%$ in $68\%$ confidence intervals. Investigating the possibility to alleviate
the tension between the measurements of present expansion rate $H_0$, coming from calibrated local
SN Ia and high-$z$ CMB data, we confirm previous findings that large local void alone is a very unlikely
explanation for the $\sim9\%$ disagreement between the two estimates. However, constraints from
our SN Ia analysis inside $1\sigma$ confidence regions of $z_{\rm size}-\delta\Omega_0/\Omega_0$
plane allow a void of e.g. $z_{\rm size}=0.075$ ($320\,{h_{70}}^{-1}$Mpc) and $\delta\Omega_0/\Omega_0=-20\%$.
Fitting Pantheon SN Ia from $0.023<z<0.15$ range, we find a $1.1\%$ shift towards lower $H_0$ value
for $\Lambda$LTB model compared to model-independent method with Taylor expanded distance formula.
Analysing luminosity density data with $\Lambda$LTB model yields constraint on contrast of large
isotropic void $\delta\Omega_0/\Omega_0 = -51.9\pm6.3\%$, which is in $\sim4\sigma$ tension
with SN Ia results. More data is necessary to better constrain the local matter density profile and
understand the disagreement between SN Ia and luminosity density samples.
