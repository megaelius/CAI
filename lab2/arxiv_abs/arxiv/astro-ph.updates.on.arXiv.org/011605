We present visible and near-infrared observations of interstellar comet 2I/Borisov taken from
2019 September 10 to 2019 October 25 using the GROWTH collaboration, the APO ARC 3.5 m, and the NASA/IRTF
3.0 m combined with pre-discovery observations obtained by the Zwicky Transient Facility between
2019 March 17 and 2019 May 05. Comparison with previous photometric imaging surveys of distant comets
shows an object similar to mildly active Solar System comets with an out-gassing rate of $\sim$10$^{27}$
mol/sec. Photometry spanning the visible to NIR range shows a gradual brightening trend of $\sim0.03$
mags/day since 2019 September 10 for a neutral to reddish colored object dominated by its surrounding
coma. Combining the recent data with pre-discovery ZTF observations of 2I reveals a brightness
trend comparable to cometary out-gassing models driven by CO at r$_h$ $>$ 6 au, consistent with its
morphology and with activity starting $\gtrsim$10 au from the Sun. The latest photometric trends
suggest the onset of significant H$_2$O sublimation. We use high-resolution NIR Keck images taken
on 2019 October 04 to estimate a hard upper limit to the diameter of $\sim$3 km confirmed with high-resolution
images from the Hubble Space Telescope (Jewitt et al. HST GO/DD Prop. 16009). The true size is likely
a factor of 2-3 smaller due to dust affecting the measurement. In addition, we find no evidence for
rotational variation during the seven-hour duration of the HST observations implying a strong
dust component to total cross-section of 2I. We combine the size estimate of 1I/'Oumuamua, with
our upper limit of 2I's size to estimate the slope of the interstellar object cumulative size-distribution
resulting in a slope of $\sim$-2.7, similar to Solar System comets, though the true slope could be
significantly steeper due to small number statistics and if the true size of 2I is much smaller than
our limit.
