The primary X-ray emission in active galactic nuclei (AGN) originates in a compact region called
the corona located very close to the super-massive black hole and the accretion disk. The knowledge
of the cut-off energy ($E_{cut}$) of the primary X-ray continuum in an AGN is very important as it
carries information on the physical characteristics of the hot X-ray emitting corona. We present
here the results of our investigation on the spectral properties of a sample of 10 nearby AGN (0.005
$<$ $z$ $<$ 0.037) observed with the {\it Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR)} . From
fitting of the {\it NuSTAR} data of 10 sources, we derived clear $E_{cut}$ values for the first time
in 8 sources and a lower limit in one source, thereby, doubling the number of AGN with $E_{cut}$ measurements
from {\it NuSTAR} data. Broad Fe K$\alpha$ line was noticed in 7 sources, while, excess emission
in the energy range beyond $\sim$15 keV arising from Compton reflection was seen in all the sources.
We also investigated the correlation of $E_{cut}$ with various physical characteristics of the
AGN such as black hole mass ($M_{BH}$), Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{Edd.}$) and X-ray photon index
($\Gamma$). We found no correlation between $E_{cut}$ and $M_{BH}$ and between $E_{cut}$ and $\lambda_{Edd.}$,
however, $E_{cut}$ correlates with $\Gamma$ in a complex manner. Also, timing analysis of the 10
sources indicates that they all are variable with indications of more variations in the soft band
relative to the hard band in some individual sources, however, considering all the sources together,
the variations are indistinguishable between hard and soft bands.
