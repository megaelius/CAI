Due to their high frame rates, high sensitivity, low noise, and low dark current, SAPHIRA detectors
provide new capabilities for astronomical observations. The SAPHIRA detector is a 320x256@24
$\mu$m pixel HgCdTe linear avalanche photodiode array manufactured by Leonardo. It is sensitive
to 0.8-2.5 $\mu$m light. Unlike other near-infrared arrays, SAPHIRA features a user-adjustable
avalanche gain, which multiplies the photon signal but has minimal impact on the read noise. This
enables the equivalent of sub-electron read noise and therefore photon-counting performance,
which has not previously been achieved with astronomical near-infrared arrays. SAPHIRA is intended
for high clocking speeds, and we developed a new readout controller to utilize this capability and
thereby enable the high frame rates ($\sim$400 Hz for the full frame or $\sim$1.7 kHz for a 128x128
pixel subarray). Beginning with the first science-grade SAPHIRA detectors and continuing with
later improved devices, we deployed SAPHIRAs to the SCExAO instrument at Subaru Telescope. SCExAO
is an extreme adaptive optics instrument intended for observations of high-contrast objects such
as debris disks and extrasolar planets. While at SCExAO, we demonstrated the ability of SAPHIRA
to function as a focal-plane wavefront sensor, and we performed extensive studies of speckle evolution.
Our demonstration of SAPHIRA's ability to wavefront sense behind pyramid optics contributed to
the decision to select a SAPHIRA detector and pyramid optics for the facility-class Keck Planet
Imager. Additionally, we utilized the high Strehl provided by SCExAO to characterize the morphology
of the HIP 79977 debris disk. Due largely to our characterization of the performance of SAPHIRA detectors
and our demonstration of their capabilities, numerous facilities throughout the world have recently
proposed to use them in instruments currently in development.
