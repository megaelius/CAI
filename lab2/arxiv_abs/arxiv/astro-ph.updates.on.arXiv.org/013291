Aims. Formamide (HCONH2) is the simplest molecule containing the peptide bond first detected in
the gas phase in Orion-KL and SgrB2. In recent years, it has been observed in high temperature regions
such as hot corinos, where thermal desorption is responsible for the sublimation of frozen mantles
into the gas phase. The interpretation of observations can benefit from information gathered in
the laboratory, where it is possible to simulate the thermal desorption process and to study formamide
under simulated space conditions such as UV irradiation. Methods. Here, two laboratory analyses
are reported: we studied formamide photo-stability under UV irradiation when it is adsorbed by
space relevant minerals at 63 K and in the vacuum regime. We also investigated temperature programmed
desorption of pure formamide ice in the presence of TiO2 dust before and after UV irradiation. Results.
Through these analyses, the effects of UV degradation and the interaction between formamide and
different minerals are compared.We find that silicates, both hydrates and anhydrates, offer molecules
a higher level of protection from UV degradation than mineral oxides. The desorption temperature
found for pure formamide is 220 K. The desorption temperature increases to 250 K when the formamide
desorbs from the surface of TiO2 grains. Conclusions. Through the experiments outlined here, it
is possible to follow the desorption of formamide and its fragments, simulate the desorption process
in star forming regions and hot corinos, and constrain parameters such as the thermal desorption
temperature of formamide and its fragments and the binding energies involved. Our results offer
support to observational data and improve our understanding of the role of the grain surface in enriching
the chemistry in space.
