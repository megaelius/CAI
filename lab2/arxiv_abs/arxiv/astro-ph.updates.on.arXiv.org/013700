The standard cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM) predicts the existence of the cosmic web: a distribution
of matter into sheets and filaments connecting massive halos. However, observational evidence
has been elusive due to the low surface brightness of the filaments. Recent deep MUSE/VLT data and
upcoming observations offer a promising avenue for Ly$\alpha$ detection, motivating the development
of modern theoretical predictions. We use hydrodynamical cosmological simulations run with the
AREPO code to investigate the potential detectability of large-scale filaments, excluding contributions
from the halos embedded in them. We focus on filaments connecting massive ($M_{200c}\sim(1-3)\times10^{12}
M_\odot$) halos at z=3, and compare different simulation resolutions, feedback levels, and mock-image
pixel sizes. We find increasing simulation resolution does not substantially improve detectability
notwithstanding the intrinsic enhancement of internal filament structure. By contrast, for a
MUSE integration of 31 hours, including feedback increases the detectable area by a factor of $\simeq$5.5
on average compared with simulations without feedback, implying that even the non-bound components
of the filaments have substantial sensitivity to feedback. Degrading the image resolution from
the native MUSE scale of (0.2")$^2$ per pixel to (5.3")$^2$ apertures has the strongest effect,
increasing the detectable area by a median factor of $\simeq$200 and is most effective when the size
of the pixel roughly matches the width of the filament. Finally, we find the majority of Ly$\alpha$
emission is due to electron impact collisional excitations, as opposed to radiative recombination.
