Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) makes it possible to recover images of astronomical sources
with extremely high angular resolution. Most recently, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has extended
VLBI to short millimeter wavelengths with a goal of achieving angular resolution sufficient for
imaging the event horizons of nearby supermassive black holes. VLBI provides measurements related
to the underlying source image through a sparse set spatial frequencies. An image can then be recovered
from these measurements by making assumptions about the underlying image. One of the most important
assumptions made by conventional imaging methods is that over the course of a night's observation
the image is static. However, for quickly evolving sources, such as the galactic center's supermassive
black hole (Sgr A*) targeted by the EHT, this assumption is violated and these conventional imaging
approaches fail. In this work we propose a new way to model VLBI measurements that allows us to recover
both the appearance and dynamics of an evolving source by reconstructing a video rather than a static
image. By modeling VLBI measurements using a Gaussian Markov Model, we are able to propagate information
across observations in time to reconstruct a video, while simultaneously learning about the dynamics
of the source's emission region. We demonstrate our proposed Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm,
StarWarps, on realistic synthetic observations of black holes, and show how it substantially improves
results compared to conventional imaging algorithms. Additionally, we demonstrate StarWarps
on real VLBI data of the M87 Jet from the VLBA.
