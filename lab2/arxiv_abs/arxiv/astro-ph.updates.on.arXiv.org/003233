We use the VIPERS final data release to investigate the performance of colour-selected populations
of galaxies as tracers of linear large-scale motions. We empirically select volume-limited samples
of blue and red galaxies as to minimise the systematic error on the estimate of the growth rate $f\sigma_8$
from the anisotropy of the two-point correlation function. To this end, rather than rigidly splitting
the sample into two colour classes we define the red/blue fractional contribution of each object
through a weight based on the $(U-V)$ colour distribution. Using mock surveys that are designed
to reproduce the observed properties of VIPERS galaxies, we find the systematic error in recovering
the fiducial value of $f\sigma_8$ to be minimized when using a volume-limited sample of luminous
blue galaxies. We model non-linear corrections via the Scoccimarro extension of the Kaiser model,
finding systematic errors on $f\sigma_8$ of below $1-2\%$, using scales as small as 5 $h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$.
We interpret this result as indicating that selection of luminous blue galaxies maximises the fraction
that are central objects in their dark matter haloes; this in turn minimises the contribution to
the measured $\xi(r_p,\pi)$ from the 1-halo term, which is dominated by non-linear motions. The
gain is inferior if one uses the full magnitude-limited sample of blue objects, consistent with
the presence of a significant fraction of blue, fainter satellites dominated by non-streaming,
orbital velocities. We measure a value of $f\sigma_8=0.45 \pm 0.11$ over the single redshift range
$0.6\le z\le 1.0$, corresponding to an effective redshift for the blue galaxies $\left<z\right>=0.85$.
Including in the likelihood the potential extra information contained in the blue-red galaxy cross-correlation
function does not lead to an appreciable improvement in the error bars, while it increases the systematic
error.
