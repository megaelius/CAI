The mass function of dark matter halos is one of the most fundamental statistics in structure formation.
Many theoretical models (such as Press-Schechter theory) are based on the notion that it could be
universal, meaning independent of redshift and cosmology, when expressed in the appropriate variables.
However, simulations exhibit persistent non-universalities in the mass functions of the virial
mass and other commonly used spherical overdensity definitions. We systematically study the universality
of mass functions over a wide range of mass definitions, for the first time including the recently
proposed splashback mass, Msp. We confirm that, in LambdaCDM cosmologies, all mass definitions
exhibit varying levels of non-universality that increase with peak height and reach between 20%
and 500% at the highest masses we can test. Mvir, M200m, and Msp exhibit similar levels of non-universality.
There are, however, two regimes where the splashback mass functions are significantly more universal.
First, they are universal to 10% at z<2, whereas spherical overdensity definitions experience
an evolution due to dark energy. Second, when additionally considering self-similar cosmologies
with extreme power spectra, splashback mass functions are remarkably universal (to between 40%
and 60%) whereas their spherical overdensity counterparts reach non-universalities between
180% and 450%. These results strongly support the notion that the splashback radius is a physically
motivated definition of the halo boundary. We present a simple, universal fitting formula for splashback
mass functions that accurately reproduces our simulation data.
