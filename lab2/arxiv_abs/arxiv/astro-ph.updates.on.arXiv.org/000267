Aim: We present a high-spatial and high-spectral resolution observation of the well-studied K
giant Aldebaran with AMBER at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). Our aim is to spatially
resolve the outer atmosphere (so-called MOLsphere) in individual CO first overtone lines and derive
its physical properties, which are important for understanding the mass-loss mechanism in normal
(i.e., non-Mira) K--M giants. Methods: Aldebaran was observed between 2.28 and 2.31 micron with
a projected baseline length of 10.4m and a spectral resolution of 12000. Results: The uniform-disk
diameter observed in the CO first overtone lines is 20--35% larger than is measured in the continuum.
We have also detected a signature of inhomogeneities in the CO-line-forming region on a spatial
scale of ~45 mas, which is more than twice as large as the angular diameter of the star itself. While
the MARCS photospheric model reproduces the observed spectrum well, the angular size in the CO lines
predicted by the MARCS model is significantly smaller than observed. This is because the MARCS model
with the parameters of Aldebaran has a geometrical extension of only ~2% (with respect to the stellar
radius). The observed spectrum and interferometric data in the CO lines can be simultaneously reproduced
by placing an additional CO layer above the MARCS photosphere. This CO layer is extended to 2.5 +/-
0.3 stellar radii with CO column densities of 5x10^{19}--2x10^{20} cm^-2 and a temperature of 1500
+/- 200 K. Conclusions: The high spectral resolution of AMBER has enabled us to spatially resolve
the inhomogeneous, extended outer atmosphere (MOLsphere) in the individual CO lines for the first
time in a K giant. Our modeling of the MOLsphere of Aldebaran suggests a rather small gradient in the
temperature distribution above the photosphere up to 2--3 stellar radii.
