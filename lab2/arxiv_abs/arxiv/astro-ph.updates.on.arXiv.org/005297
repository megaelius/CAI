Temporal variations in the Suns internal velocity field with a periodicity of about 11 years have
been observed over the last four decades. The period of these torsional oscillations and their latitudinal
propagation roughly coincides with the period and equatorward propagation of sunspots which originate
from a magnetohydrodynamic dynamo mechanism operating in the Suns interior. While the solar differential
rotation plays an important role in this dynamo mechanism by inducting the toroidal component of
magnetic field, the impact of torsional oscillations on the dynamo mechanism and hence the solar
cycle is not well understood. Here, we include the observed torsional oscillations into a flux transport
dynamo model of the solar cycle to investigate their effect. We find that the overall amplitude of
the solar cycle does not change significantly on inclusion of torsional oscillations. However,
all the characteristics of the Waldmeier effect in the sunspot cycle are qualitatively reproduced
by varying only the amplitude of torsional oscillations. The Waldmeier effect, first noted in 1935,
includes the important characteristic that the amplitude of sunspot cycles is anti-correlated
to their rise time; cycles with high initial rise rate tend to be stronger. This has implications
for solar cycle predictions. Our results suggest that the Waldmeier effect could be a plausible
outcome of cycle to cycle modulation of torsional oscillations and provides a physical basis for
sunspot cycle forecasts based on torsional oscillation observations. We also provide a theoretical
explanation based on the magnetic induction equation thereby connecting two apparently disparate
phenomena.
