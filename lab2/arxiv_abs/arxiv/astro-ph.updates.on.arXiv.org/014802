The rich structure that we observe in molecular clouds is due to the interplay between strong magnetic
fields and supersonic (turbulent) velocity fluctuations. The velocity fluctuations interact
with the magnetic field, causing it too to fluctuate. Using numerical simulations, we explore the
nature of such magnetic field fluctuations, $\vec{\delta B}$, over a wide range of turbulent Mach
numbers, $\mathcal{M} = 2 - 10$ (i.e., from weak to strong compressibility), and Alfv\'en Mach numbers,
$\mathcal{M}_{\text{A}0} = 0.1 - 100$ (i.e., from strong to weak magnetic mean fields, $B_0$).
We derive a compressible quasi-static fluctuation model from the magnetohydrodynamical (MHD)
equations and show that velocity gradients parallel to the mean magnetic field give rise to compressible
modes in sub-Alfv\'enic flows, which prevents the flow from becoming two-dimensional, as is the
case in incompressible MHD turbulence. We then generalise an analytical model for the magnitude
of the magnetic fluctuations to include $\mathcal{M}$, and find $|\vec{\delta B}| = \delta B = c_s\sqrt{\pi\rho_0}\mathcal{M}\mathcal{M}_{\text{A}0}$,
where $c_s$ is the sound speed and $\rho_0$ is the mean density of gas. This new relation fits well
in the strong $B$-field regime. We go on to study the anisotropy between the perpendicular ($ B_{\perp}$)
and parallel ($ B_{\parallel}$) fluctuations and the mean-normalised fluctuations, which we
find follow universal scaling relations, invariant of $\mathcal{M}$. We provide a detailed analysis
of the morphology for the $\delta B_{\perp}$ and $\delta B_{\parallel}$ probability density functions
and find that eddies aligned with $B_0$ cause parallel fluctuations that reduce $B_{\parallel}$
in the most anisotropic simulations. We discuss broadly the implications of our fluctuation models
for magnetised gases in the interstellar medium.
