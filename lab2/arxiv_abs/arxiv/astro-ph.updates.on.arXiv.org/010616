We present a study on the formation of planetary systems around low mass stars similar to Trappist-1,
through the accretion of either planetesimals or pebbles. The aim is to determine if the currently
observed systems around low mass stars favour one scenario over the other. We ran numerous N-body
simulations, coupled to a thermally evolving viscous disc model, including prescriptions for
planet migration and photoevaporation. We examine the differences between the pebble and planetesimal
accretion scenarios, but also look at the influences of disc mass, planetesimal size, and the percentage
of solids locked up within pebbles. When comparing the resulting planetary systems to Trappist-1,
we find that a wide range of initial conditions for both accretion scenarios can form planetary systems
similar to Trappist-1, in terms of planet mass, periods, and resonant configurations. Typically
these planets formed exterior to the water iceline and migrated in resonant convoys to close to the
central star. When comparing the planetary systems formed from pebbles to those formed from planetesimals,
we find a large number of similarities, including average planet masses, eccentricities, inclinations
and period ratios. One major difference was that of the water content of the planets. When including
the effects of ablation and full recycling of the planets envelope with the disc, planets formed
from pebbles were extremely dry, whilst those formed from planetesimals were extremely wet. If
the water content is not fully recycled and instead falls to the planets core, or if ablation of the
water is neglected, then the planets formed from pebbles are extremely wet, similar to those formed
from planetesimals. Should the water content of the Trappist-1 planets be determined accurately,
this could point to a preferred formation pathway for planetary systems, or to specific physics
that may be at play.
