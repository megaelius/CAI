Water megamaser emission at 22 GHz has proven to be a powerful tool for astrophysical studies of AGN
allowing an accurate determination of the central black hole mass and of the accretion disc geometry
and dynamics. However, after searches among thousands of galaxies, only ~ 200 of them have shown
such spectroscopic features, most of them of uncertain classification. In addition, the physical
and geometrical conditions under which maser activates are still unknown. In this work we aim at
characterizing the occurrence of water maser emission in an unbiased sample of AGN, investigating
the relation with the X-ray properties and the possible favorable geometry needed to detect water
maser. We have searched for 22 GHz maser emission in a hard X-ray selected sample of AGN, taken from
the INTEGRAL/IBIS survey above 20 keV. Of the 380 sources in the sample, only half have water maser
data. We have also considered a sub-sample of 87 sources, volume limited, for which we obtained new
Green Bank Telescope and Effelsberg observations (for 35 sources), detecting one new maser and
increasing its radio coverage to 75%. The detection rate of water maser emission in the total sample
is 15+/-3%, this fraction raises up to 19+/-5% for the complete sub-sample, especially if considering
type 2 and Compton thick AGN. These results demonstrate that the hard X-ray selection may significantly
enhance the maser detection efficiency over comparably large optical/infrared surveys. A possible
decline of the detection fraction with increasing luminosity might suggest that an extreme luminous
nuclear environment does not favour maser emission. The large fraction of CT AGN with water maser
emission could be explained in terms of geometrical effects, being the maser medium the very edge-on
portion of the obscuring medium.
