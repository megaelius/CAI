We investigate the relation between the detection of the $11.3\,\mu$m PAH feature in the nuclear
($\sim 24-230\,$pc) regions of 22 nearby Seyfert galaxies and the properties of the cold molecular
gas. For the former we use ground-based (0.3-0.6" resolution) mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectroscopy.
The cold molecular gas is traced by ALMA and NOEMA high (0.2-1.1") angular resolution observations
of the CO(2-1) transition. Galaxies with a nuclear detection of the $11.3\,\mu$m PAH feature contain
more cold molecular gas (median $1.6\times 10^7\,M_\odot$) and have higher column densities ($N({\rm
H}_2) = 2 \times 10^{23}\,{\rm cm}^{-2}$) over the regions sampled by the mid-IR slits than those
without a detection. This suggests that molecular gas plays a role in shielding the PAH molecules
in the harsh environments of Seyfert nuclei. Choosing the PAH molecule naphthalene as an illustration,
we compute its half-life in the nuclear regions of our sample when exposed to 2.5keV hard X-ray photons.
We estimate shorter half-lives for naphthalene in nuclei without a $11.3\,\mu$m PAH detection
than in those with a detection. The Spitzer/IRS PAH ratios on circumnuclear scales ($\sim$ 4" $\sim$
0.25-1.3kpc) are in between model predictions for neutral and partly ionized PAHs. However, Seyfert
galaxies in our sample with the highest nuclear H$_2$ column densities are not generally closer
to the neutral PAH tracks. This is because in the majority of our sample galaxies, the CO(2-1) emission
in the inner $\sim$ 4" is not centrally peaked and in some galaxies traces circumnuclear sites of
strong star formation activity. Spatially resolved observations with the MIRI medium-resolution
spectrograph (MRS) on the James Webb Space Telescope will be able to distinguish the effects of an
active galactic nucleus (AGN) and star formation on the PAH emission in nearby AGN.
