Morphological classification is a key piece of information to define samples of galaxies aiming
to study the large-scale structure of the universe. In essence, the challenge is to build up a robust
methodology to perform a reliable morphological estimate from galaxy images. Here, we investigate
how to substantially improve the galaxy classification within large datasets by mimicking human
classification. We combine accurate visual classifications from the Galaxy Zoo project with machine
and deep learning methodologies. We propose two distinct approaches for galaxy morphology: one
based on non-parametric morphology and traditional machine learning algorithms; and another
based on Deep Learning. To measure the input features for the traditional machine learning methodology,
we have developed a system called CyMorph, with a novel non-parametric approach to study galaxy
morphology. The main datasets employed comes from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS-DR7).
We also discuss the class imbalance problem considering three classes. Performance of each model
is mainly measured by Overall Accuracy (OA). A spectroscopic validation with astrophysical parameters
is also provided for Decision Tree models to assess the quality of our morphological classification.
In all of our samples, both Deep and Traditional Machine Learning approaches have over 94.5% OA to
classify galaxies in two classes (elliptical and spiral). We compare our classification with state-of-the-art
morphological classification from literature. Considering only two classes separation, we achieve
99% of overall accuracy in average when using our deep learning models, and 82% when using three classes.
We provide a catalog with 670,560 galaxies containing our best results, including morphological
metrics and classification.
