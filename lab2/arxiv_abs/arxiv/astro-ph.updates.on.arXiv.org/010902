We use a homogeneous catalog of 42,000 main-sequence wide binaries identified by Gaia to measure
the mass ratio distribution, p(q), of binaries with primary masses $0.1<M_1/M_{\odot}<2.5$,
mass ratios $0.1 \lesssim q<1$, and separations $50<s/{\rm AU}<50,000$. A well-understood selection
function allows us to constrain p(q) in 35 independent bins of primary mass and separation, with
hundreds to thousands of binaries in each bin. Our investigation reveals a sharp excess of equal-mass
"twin" binaries that is statistically significant out to separations of 1,000 to 10,000 AU, depending
on primary mass. The excess is narrow: a steep increase in p(q) at $0.95 \lesssim q<1$, with no significant
excess at $q\lesssim 0.95$. A range of tests confirm the signal is real, not a data artifact or selection
effect. Combining the Gaia constraints with those from close binaries, we show that the twin excess
decreases with increasing separation, but its width ($q\gtrsim 0.95$) is constant over $0.01<a/{\rm
AU}<10,000$. The wide twin population would be difficult to explain if the components of all wide
binaries formed via core fragmentation, which is not expected to produce strongly correlated component
masses. We conjecture that wide twins formed at closer separations ($a \lesssim 100$ AU), likely
via accretion from circumbinary disks, and were subsequently widened by dynamical interactions
in their birth environments. The separation-dependence of the twin excess then constrains the
efficiency of dynamical widening and disruption of binaries in young clusters. We also constrain
p(q) across $0.1 \lesssim q<1$. Besides changes in the twin fraction, p(q) is independent of separation
at fixed primary mass over $100 \lesssim s/{\rm AU} < 50,000$. It is flatter than expected for random
pairings from the IMF but more bottom-heavy for wide binaries than for binaries with $a\lesssim$100
AU.
