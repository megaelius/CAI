Binaries could provide the best niches for life in the galaxy. Though counterintuitive, this assertion
follows directly from stellar tidal interaction theory and the evolution of lower mass stars. There
is strong evidence that chromospheric activity of rapidly rotating young stars may be high enough
to cause mass loss from atmospheres of potentially habitable planets. The removal of atmospheric
water is most critical. Tidal breaking in binaries could help reduce magnetic dynamo action and
thereby chromospheric activity in favor of life. We call this the Binary Habitability Mechanism
(BHM), that we suggest allows for water retention at levels comparable to or better than Earth. We
discuss novel advantages that life may exploit, in these cases, and suggest that life may even thrive
on some circumbinary planets. We find that while many binaries do not benefit from BHM, high quality
niches do exist for various combinations of stars between 0.55 and 1.0 solar masses. For a given pair
of stellar masses, BHM operates only for certain combinations of period and eccentricity. Binaries
having a solar-type primary seem to be quite well suited niches having wide and distant habitable
zones with plentiful water and sufficient light for photosynthetic life. We speculate that, as
a direct result of BHM, conditions may be suitable for life on several planets and possibly even moons
of giant planets orbiting some binaries. Lower mass combinations, while more restrictive in parameter
space, provide niches lasting many billions of years and are rich suppliers of photosynthetic photons.
