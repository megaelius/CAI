We report observations of Faraday rotation measures (RMs) for a sample of 191 extragalactic radio
jets observed within the MOJAVE program. Multifrequency VLBA observations were carried out over
twelve epochs in 2006 at four frequencies between 8 and 15 GHz. We detect parsec-scale Faraday RMs
in 149 sources and find the quasars to have larger RMs on average than BL Lac objects. The median core
RMs are significantly higher than in the jet components. This is especially true for quasars where
we detect a significant negative correlation between the magnitude of the RM and the de-projected
distance from the core. We perform detailed simulations of the observational errors of total intensity,
polarization and Faraday rotation, and concentrate on the errors of transverse Faraday RM gradients
in unresolved jets. Our simulations show that the finite image restoring beam size has a significant
effect on the observed RM gradients, and spurious gradients can occur due to noise in the data if the
jet is less than two beams wide in polarization. We detect significant transverse RM gradients in
four sources (0923+392, 1226+023, 2230+114 and 2251+158). In 1226+023 the RM is for the first time
seen to change sign from positive to negative over the transverse cuts, which supports the presence
of a helical magnetic field in the jet. In this source we also detect variations in the jet RM over a
time scale of three months, which are difficult to explain with external Faraday screens and suggest
internal Faraday rotation. By comparing fractional polarization changes in jet components between
the four frequency bands to depolarization models we find that an external purely random Faraday
screen viewed through only a few lines of sight can explain most of our polarization observations
but in some sources, such as 1226+023 and 2251+158, internal Faraday rotation is needed.
