The extreme conditions found in and around pulsars make them fantastic natural laboratories, providing
insights to a rich variety of fundamental physics and astronomy. To discover more pulsars we have
begun the High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) survey: a blind survey of the northern sky with the
100-m Effelsberg radio telescope in Germany and a twin survey of the southern sky with the 64-m Parkes
radio telescope in Australia. The HTRU is an international collaboration with expertise shared
among the MPIfR in Germany, ATNF/CASS and Swinburne University of Technology in Australia, University
of Manchester in the UK and INAF in Italy. The HTRU survey uses multi-beam receivers and backends
constructed with recent advancements in technology, providing unprecedentedly high time and
frequency resolution, allowing us to probe deeper into the Galaxy than ever before. While a general
overview of HTRU has been given by Keith at this conference, here we focus on three further aspects
of HTRU discoveries and highlights. These include the `Diamond-planet pulsar' binary PSR J1719-1438
and a second similar system recently discovered. In addition, we provide specifications of the
HTRU-North survey and an update of its status. In the last section we give an overview of the search
for highly-accelerated binaries in the Galactic plane region. We discuss the computational challenges
arising from the processing of the petabyte-sized HTRU survey data. We present an innovative segmented
search technique which aims to increase our chances of discovering highly accelerated relativistic
binary systems, potentially including pulsar-black-hole binaries.
