Vortex motions are frequently observed on the solar photosphere. These motions may play a key role
in the transport of energy and momentum from the lower atmosphere into the upper solar atmosphere,
contributing to coronal heating. The lower solar atmosphere also consists of complex networks
of flux tubes that expand and merge throughout the chromosphere and upper atmosphere. We perform
numerical simulations to investigate the behaviour of vortex driven waves propagating in a pair
of such flux tubes in a non-force-free equilibrium with a realistically modelled solar atmosphere.
The two flux tubes are independently perturbed at their footpoints by counter-rotating vortex
motions. When the flux tubes merge, the vortex motions interact both linearly and nonlinearly.
The linear interactions generate many small-scale transient magnetic substructures due to the
magnetic stress imposed by the vortex motions. Thus, an initially monolithic tube is separated
into a complex multi-threaded tube due to the photospheric vortex motions. The wave interactions
also drive a superposition that increases in amplitude until it exceeds the local Mach number and
produces shocks that propagate upwards with speeds of approximately $ 50$ km s$^{-1}$. The shocks
act as conduits transporting momentum and energy upwards, and heating the local plasma by more than
an order of magnitude, with peak temperature approximately $60,000$ K. Therefore, we present a
new mechanism for the generation of magnetic waveguides from the lower solar atmosphere to the solar
corona. This wave guide appears as the result of interacting perturbations in neighbouring flux
tubes. Thus, the interactions of photospheric vortex motions is a potentially significant mechanism
for energy transfer from the lower to upper solar atmosphere.
