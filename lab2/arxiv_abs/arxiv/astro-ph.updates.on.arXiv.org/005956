We develop and apply a model to quantify the global efficiency of radial orbit migration among stars
in the Milky Way disk. This model parameterizes the possible star formation and enrichment histories,
radial birth profiles, and combines them with a migration model that relates present-day orbital
radii to birth radii through a Gaussian probability, broadening with age $\tau$ as $\sigma_\mathrm{RM8}~\sqrt{\tau/8{~\mathrm{Gyr}}}$.
Guided by observations, we assume that stars are born with an initially tight age--metallicity
relation at given radius, which becomes subsequently scrambled by radial orbit migration, thereby
providing a direct observational constraint on radial orbit migration strength $\sigma_\mathrm{RM8}$.
We fit this model with MCMC to the observed age--metallicity distribution of low-$\alpha$ red clump
stars with Galactocentric radii between 5 and 14 kpc from APOGEE DR12, sidestepping the complex
spatial selection function and accounting for the considerable age uncertainties. This simple
model reproduces well the observed data, and we find a global (in radius and time) radial orbit migration
efficiency in the Milky Way of $\sigma_\mathrm{RM8}=3.6\pm 0.1$ kpc when marginalizing over all
other model aspects. This shows that radial orbit migration in the Milky Way's main disk is indeed
rather strong, in line with theoretical expectations: stars migrate by about a half-mass radius
over the age of the disk. The model finds the Sun's birth radius at $\sim 5.2$ kpc. If such strong radial
orbit migration is typical, this mechanism plays indeed an important role in setting the structural
regularity of disk galaxies.
