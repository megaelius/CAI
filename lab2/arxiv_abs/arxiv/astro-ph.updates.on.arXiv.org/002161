The massive infrared dark cloud G0.253+0.016 projected 45pc from the Galactic centre contains
~10^5Msun of dense gas whilst being mostly devoid of observed star-formation tracers. To scrutinise
the physical properties, dynamics and structure of this cloud with reference to its star-forming
potential, we have carried out a concerted SMA and IRAM 30m study of this cloud in dust continuum,
CO isotopologues, shock tracing molecules, as well as H$_2$CO to trace the gas temperature. We detect
and characterise the dust cores within G0.253+0.016 at ~1.3 mm and find that the kinetic temperature
of the gas is >320K on size-scales of ~0.15 pc. Analysis of the position-velocity diagrams of
our observed lines show broad linewidths and strong shock emission in the south of the cloud, indicating
that G0.253+0.016 is colliding with another cloud at v(LSR)~70 km/s. We confirm via an analysis
of the observed dynamics in the CMZ that it is an elongated structure, orientated with Sgr B2 closer
to the Sun than Sgr A*, however our results suggest that the actual geometry may be more complex than
an elliptical ring. We find that the column density PDF of G0.253+0.016 is log-normal with no discernible
power-law tail, consistent with little star formation, and that its width can be explained in the
framework of theory predicting the density structure of clouds created by supersonic, magnetised
turbulence. We also present the delta-variance spectrum of this region, and show it is consistent
with that expected for clouds with no star formation. Using G0.253+0.016 as a test-bed of the conditions
required for star formation in a different physical environment to that of nearby clouds, we also
conclude that there is not one column density threshold for star formation, but instead this value
is dependant on the local physical conditions. [Abbrv.]
