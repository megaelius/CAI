A low-mass companion to the two-solar mass star HIP65426 has recently been detected by SPHERE at
around 100 au from its host. Explaining the presence of super-Jovian planets at large separations,
as revealed by direct imaging, is currently an open question. We want to derive statistical constraints
on the mass and initial entropy of HIP65426b and to explore possible formation pathways of directly
imaged objects within the core-accretion paradigm, focusing on HIP65426b. Constraints on the
planet's mass and post-formation entropy are derived from its age and luminosity combined with
cooling models. For the first time, the results of population synthesis are also used to inform the
results. Then, a formation model that includes N-body dynamics with several embryos per disc is
used to study possible formation histories and the properties of possible additional companions.
Finally, the outcomes of two- and three-planet scattering in the post-disc phase are analysed,
taking tides into account. The mass of HIP65426b is found to be Mp = 9.9 +1.1 -1.8 MJ using the hot population
and Mp = 10.9 +1.4 -2.0 MJ with the cold-nominal population. Core formation at small separations
from the star followed by outward scattering and runaway accretion at a few hundred AU succeeds in
reproducing the mass and separation of HIP65426b. Alternatively, systems having two or more giant
planets close enough to be on an unstable orbit at disc dispersal are likely to end up with one planet
on a wide HIP65426b-like orbit with a relatively high eccentricity (>~ 0.5). If this scattering
scenario explains its formation, HIP65426b is predicted to have a high eccentricity and to be accompanied
by one or several roughly Jovian-mass planets at smaller semi-major axes, which also could have
a high eccentricity. This could be tested by further direct-imaging as well as radial-velocity
observations.
