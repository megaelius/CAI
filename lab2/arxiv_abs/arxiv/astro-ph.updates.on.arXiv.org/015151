High-redshift blazars are among the most powerful objects in the Universe. The spectral and temporal
properties of thirty-three distant blazars ($z>2.5$) detected in the high energy $\gamma$-ray
band are investigated by analyzing the {\it Fermi}-LAT and {\it Swift} UVOT/ XRT data. The considered
sources have soft time averaged $\gamma$-ray spectra ($\Gamma_{\rm \gamma}\geq2.2$) whereas
those that have been observed in the X-ray band have hard X-ray spectra ($\Gamma_{\rm X}=1.01-1.86$).
The $\gamma$-ray flux of high-redshift blazars ranges from $4.84\times10^{-10}$ to $1.50\times10^{-7}\:{\rm
photon\:cm^{-2}\:s^{-1}}$ and the luminosity is within $(0.10-5.54)\times10^{48}\:{\rm erg\:s^{-1}}$
which during the $\gamma$-ray flares increases up to $(0.1-1)\times10^{50}\:{\rm erg\:s^{-1}}$.
In the X-ray band, only the emission of PKS 0438-43, B2 0743+25 and TXS 0222+185 is found to vary in
different Swift XRT observations whereas in the $\gamma$-ray band, the emission is variable for
fourteen sources: the flux of B3 1343+451 and PKS 0537-286 changes in sub-day scales, that of PKS
0347-211 and PKS 0451-28 in day scales, while the$\gamma$-ray variability of the others is in week
or month scales. The properties of distant blazar jets are derived by modeling the multiwavelength
spectral energy distributions within a one-zone leptonic scenario assuming that the X-ray and
$\gamma$-ray emissions are produced from inverse Compton scattering of synchrotron and dusty
torus photons. From the fitting, the emission region size is found to be $\leq0.05$ pc and the magnetic
field and the Doppler factor are correspondingly within $0.10-1.74$ G and $10.0-27.4$. By modeling
the optical-UV excess, we found that the central black hole masses and accretion disk luminosities
are within $L_{\rm d}\simeq(1.09-10.94)\times10^{46}\:{\rm erg \: s^{-1}}$ and $(1.69-5.35)\times10^{9}\:M_\odot$,
respectively.
