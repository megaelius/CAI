Context.In recent years, non-blazar Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) such as Radio Galaxies have emerged
as a highly instructive source class providing unique insights into high energy acceleration and
radiation mechanisms. Aims.Here we aim at a detailed characterization of the high-energy (HE;>100
MeV) gamma-ray emission from the prominent radio galaxy M87. Methods.We analyze 8 years of Fermi-LAT
data and derive the spectral energy distribution between 100 MeV and 300 GeV. We extract lightcurves
and investigate the variability behaviour for the entire energy range as well as below and above
10 GeV. Results.Our analysis provides (i)evidence for HE gamma-ray flux variability and (ii)indications
for a possible excess over the standard power-law model above Eb~10 GeV, similar to the earlier indications
in the case of Cen A. When viewed in HE-VHE context, this is most naturally explained by an additional
component dominating the highest-energy part of the spectrum. Investigation of the gamma-ray
lightcurves suggests that the lower-energy (<10 GeV) component is variable on timescales of (at
least) a few months. The statistics of the high energy component (>10 GeV) does not allow significant
constraints on variability. We find indications, however, for spectral changes with time that
support variability of the putative additional component and seem to favor jet-related scenarios
for its origin capable of accommodating month-type variability. Conclusions.The current findings
suggest that both the high-energy (> Eb) and the very high energy (VHE;>100 GeV) emission in M87 are
compatible with originating from the same physical component. The variability behaviour at VHE
then allows further constraints on the location and the nature of the second component. In particular,
these considerations suggest that the VHE emission during the quiescent state originates in a similar
region as during the flare.
