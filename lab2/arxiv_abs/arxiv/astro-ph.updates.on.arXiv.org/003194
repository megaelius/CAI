The rare hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) have been predominantly found in low-metallicity,
star-forming dwarf galaxies. Here we identify Gaia17biu/SN 2017egm as an SLSN-I occurring in a
"normal" spiral galaxy (NGC 3191) in terms of stellar mass (several times 10^10 M_sun) and metallicity
(roughly solar). At redshift z=0.031, Gaia17biu is also the lowest redshift SLSN-I to date, and
the absence of a larger population of SLSNe-I in dwarf galaxies of similar redshift suggests that
metallicity is likely less important to the production of SLSNe-I than previously believed. With
the smallest distance and highest apparent brightness for a SLSN-I, we are able to study Gaia17biu
in unprecedented detail. Its pre-peak NUV to optical color is similar to that of Gaia16apd and among
the bluest observed for a SLSN-I, while its peak luminosity (M_g = -21) is at the low end of the SLSN-I
luminosity function. The pre-peak spectra resemble those of some fast-declining SLSNe-I while
the post-peak spectra are similar to those of slow-declining SLSNe-I, suggesting that the post-peak
decline rate is probably not a useful indicator for describing the spectral diversity of SLSNe-I.
Thanks to the high SNRs of our spectra, we identify several new spectroscopic features that may help
to probe the properties of these enigmatic explosions. We also detect polarization at the ~0.5%
level that is not strongly dependent on wavelength, suggesting a modest, global departure from
spherical symmetry for the source. In addition, we put the tightest upper limit yet on the radio luminosity
of an SLSN-I at <5.4x10^26 erg/s/Hz (at 10 GHz), which is almost a factor of 40 better than previous
upper limits and one of the few measured at an early stage in the evolution of an SLSN-I. This limit
largely rules out an association of this SLSNe-I with known populations of GRBs.
