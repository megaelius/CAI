We present $HST$ narrow-band near-infrared imaging of Pa$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$ emission of 48
local Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs) from the Great Observatories All-Sky LIRG Survey (GOALS).
These data allow us to measure the properties of 810 spatially resolved star-forming regions (59
nuclei and 751 extra-nuclear clumps), and directly compare their properties to those found in both
local and high-redshift star-forming galaxies. We find that in LIRGs, the star-forming clumps
have radii ranging from $\sim90-900$ pc and star formation rates (SFRs) of $\sim1\times10^{-3}$
to 10 M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$, with median values for extra-nuclear clumps of 170 pc and 0.03 M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$.
The detected star-forming clumps are young, with a median stellar age of $8.7$ Myrs, and a median
stellar mass of $5\times10^{5}$ M$_\odot$. The SFRs span the range of those found in normal local
star-forming galaxies to those found in high-redshift star-forming galaxies at $\rm{z}=1-3$.
The luminosity function of the LIRG clumps has a flatter slope than found in lower-luminosity, star-forming
galaxies, indicating a relative excess of luminous star-forming clumps. In order to predict the
possible range of star-forming histories and gas fractions, we compare the star-forming clumps
to those measured in the MassiveFIRE high-resolution cosmological simulation. The star-forming
clumps in MassiveFIRE cover the same range of SFRs and sizes found in the local LIRGs and have total
gas fractions that extend from 10 to 90%. If local LIRGs are similar to these simulated galaxies,
we expect future observations with ALMA will find a large range of gas fractions, and corresponding
star formation efficiencies, among the star-forming clumps in LIRGs.
