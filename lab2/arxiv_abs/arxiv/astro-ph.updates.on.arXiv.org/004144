Aim : The nearby TeV blazar 1ES 1959+650 (z=0.047) was reported to be in flaring state during June
- July 2016 by Fermi-LAT, FACT, MAGIC and VERITAS collaborations. We studied the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) in different states of the flare during MJD 57530 - 57589 using simultaneous
multiwaveband data to understand the possible broadband emission scenario during the flare. Methods
: The UV/optical and X-ray data from UVOT and XRT respectively on board Swift and high energy $\gamma$-ray
data from Fermi-LAT are used to generate multiwaveband lightcurves as well as to obtain high flux
states and quiescent state SEDs. The correlation and lag between different energy bands is quantified
using discrete correlation function. The synchrotron self Compton (SSC) model was used to reproduce
the observed SEDs during flaring and quiescent states of the source. Results : A decent correlation
is seen between X-ray and high energy $\gamma$-ray fluxes. The spectral hardening with increase
in the flux is seen in X-ray band. The powerlaw index vs flux plot in $\gamma$-ray band indicates the
different emission regions for 0.1 - 3 GeV and 3-300 GeV energy photons. Two zone SSC model satisfactorily
fits the observed broadband SEDs. The inner zone is mainly responsible for producing synchrotron
peak and high energy $\gamma$-ray part of the SED in all states. The second zone is mainly required
to produce less variable optical/UV and low energy $\gamma$-ray emission. Conclusions : Conventional
single zone SSC model does not satisfactorily explain broadband emission during observation period
considered. There is an indication of two emission zones in the jet which are responsible for producing
broadband emission from optical to high energy $\gamma$-rays.
