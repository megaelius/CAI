Gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is expected to be amongst the most
powerful cosmological tools for ongoing and upcoming CMB experiments. In this work, we investigate
a bias to CMB lensing reconstruction from temperature anisotropies due to the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
(kSZ) effect, that is, the Doppler shift of CMB photons induced by Compton-scattering off moving
electrons. The kSZ signal yields biases due to both its own intrinsic non-Gaussianity and its non-zero
cross-correlation with the CMB lensing field (and other fields that trace the large-scale structure).
This kSZ-induced bias affects both the CMB lensing auto-power spectrum and its cross-correlation
with low-redshift tracers. Furthermore, it cannot be removed by multifrequency foreground separation
techniques because the kSZ effect preserves the blackbody spectrum of the CMB. While statistically
negligible for current datasets, we show that it will be important for upcoming surveys, and failure
to account for it can lead to large biases in constraints on neutrino masses or the properties of dark
energy. For a Stage 4 CMB experiment, the bias can be as large as $\approx$ 15% or 12% in cross-correlation
with LSST galaxy lensing convergence or galaxy overdensity maps, respectively, when the maximum
temperature multipole used in the reconstruction is $\ell_{\rm max} = 4000$, and about half of that
when $\ell_{\rm max} = 3000$. Similarly, we find that the CMB lensing auto-power spectrum can be
biased by nearly 10%, although our numerical calculation includes only the expected dominant term.
These biases are many times larger than the expected statistical errors. Reducing $\ell_{\rm max}$
can significantly mitigate the bias at the cost of a decrease in the overall lensing reconstruction
signal-to-noise. Polarization-only reconstruction may be the most robust mitigation strategy.
