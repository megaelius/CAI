Quasar microlensing serves as a unique probe of discrete objects within galaxies and galaxy clusters.
Recent advancement of the technique shows that it can constrain planet-scale objects beyond our
native galaxy by studying their induced microlensing signatures, the energy shift of emission
lines originated in the vicinity of the black hole of high redshift background quasars. We employ
this technique to exert effective constraints on the planet-mass object distribution within two
additional lens systems, Q J0158$-$4325 ($z_l = 0.317$) and SDSS J1004+4112 ($z_l = 0.68$) using
Chandra observations of the two gravitationally-lensed quasars. The observed variations of the
emission line peak energy can be explained as microlensing of the FeK$\alpha$ emission region induced
by planet-mass microlenses. To corroborate this, we perform microlensing simulations to determine
the probability of a caustic transiting the source region and compare this with the observed line
shift rates. Our analysis yields constraints on the sub-stellar population, with masses ranging
from Moon ($10^{-8} M_{\odot}$) to Jupiter ($10^{-3} M_{\odot}$) sized bodies, within these galaxy
or cluster scale structures, with total mass fractions of $\sim 3\times10^{-4}$ and $\sim 1\times10^{-4}$
with respect to halo mass for Q J0158$-$4325 and SDSS J1004+4112, respectively. Our analysis suggests
that unbound planet-mass objects are universal in galaxies, and we surmise the objects to be either
free-floating planets or primordial black holes. We present the first-ever constraints on the
sub-stellar mass distribution in the intra-cluster light of a galaxy cluster. Our analysis yields
the most stringent limit for primordial black holes at the mass range.
