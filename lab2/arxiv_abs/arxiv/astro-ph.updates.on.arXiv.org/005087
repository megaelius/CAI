Quasars (QSOs) hosting supermassive black holes are believed to reside in massive halos harboring
galaxy overdensities. However, many observations revealed average or low galaxy densities around
$z\gtrsim6$ QSOs. This could be partly because they measured galaxy densities in only tens of arcmin$^2$
around QSOs and might have overlooked potential larger scale galaxy overdensities. Some previous
studies also observed only Lyman break galaxies (LBGs, massive older galaxies) and missed low mass
young galaxies like Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) around QSOs. Here we present observations of LAE
and LBG candidates in $\sim700$ arcmin$^2$ around a $z=6.61$ luminous QSO using Subaru Telescope
Suprime-Cam with narrow/broadbands. We compare their sky distributions, number densities and
angular correlation functions with those of LAEs/LBGs detected in the same manner and comparable
data quality in our control blank field. In the QSO field, LAEs and LBGs are clustering in 4-20 comoving
Mpc angular scales, but LAEs show mostly underdensity over the field while LBGs are forming $30\times60$
comoving Mpc$^2$ large scale structure containing 3-$7\sigma$ high density clumps. The highest
density clump includes a bright (23.78 mag in the narrowband) extended ($\gtrsim 16$ kpc) Ly$\alpha$
blob candidate, indicative of a dense environment. The QSO could be part of the structure but is not
located exactly at any of the high density peaks. Near the QSO, LAEs show underdensity while LBGs
average to $4\sigma$ excess densities compared to the control field. If these environments reflect
halo mass, the QSO may not be in the most massive halo, but still in a moderately massive one.
