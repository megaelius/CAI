The Rosetta mission delivered images of comet 67P's nucleus at unprecedented resolution which
indicate the presence of a global layering system. By merging techniques of structural geology,
statistical image processing, and solar system science, this thesis aims to contribute to the understanding
of the formation of the layerings, and thus of cometary nuclei as a whole. I describe the two distinctive
approaches to studying the layerings' orientation on comet 67P's nucleus. First, I mapped layering-related
linear features on a 3D shape model of the nucleus, onto which I projected high-res OSIRIS images.
I selected only lineaments of substantial curvature, and used a plane-fitting algorithm to find
the normals to the layering planes represented by these lineaments. I used the normals to confirm
previous authors' results, including that the layering systems on the comet's two lobes are geometrically
independent from each other. My results rule out the proposal that 67P's lobes represent collisional
fragments of a much larger, layered body. Second, I developed a Fourier-based image analysis algorithm
to detect lineament structures at pixel-precision. I analysed the layering-related features
exposed on the Hathor cliff on the comet's Small Lobe. I found my algorithm to be a broadly applicable,
powerful tool for automating the detection of layerings in images where conventional edge-detection
algorithms are not effective. When correctly configured to the target conditions, I found the algorithm
to have a higher signal-to-noise detection sensitivity than a human, while reducing over-interpretation
due to bias. In summary, I studied the layerings in the nucleus of comet 67P using several unconventional
approaches and constrained their lateral extent, curvature, and to a degree also their thickness.
Finally, I nominated two mechanisms that could have formed these layerings in cometary nuclei.
