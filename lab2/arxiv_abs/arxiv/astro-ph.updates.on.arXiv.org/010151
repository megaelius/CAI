Older GCE models predict [K/Fe] ratios as much as 1 dex lower than those inferred from stellar observations.
Abundances of potassium are mainly based on analyses of the 7698 $\AA$ resonance line, and the discrepancy
between models and observations is in part caused by the LTE assumption. We study the statistical
equilibrium of KI, focusing on the non-LTE effects on the $7698 \ \AA$ line. We aim to determine how
non-LTE abundances of K can improve the analysis of its chemical evolution, and help to constrain
the yields of models. We construct a model atom that employs the most up-to-date data. In particular,
we calculate and present inelastic e+K collisional excitation cross-sections from the convergent
close-coupling and the $B$-Spline $R$-matrix methods, and H+K collisions from the two-electron
model. We constructed a fine grid of non-LTE abundance corrections that span $4000<\teff / \rm{K}<8000$,
$0.50<\lgg<5.00$, $-5.00<\feh<+0.50$, and applied the corrections to abundances from the literature.
In concordance with previous studies, we find severe non-LTE effects in the $7698 \ \AA$ line, which
is stronger in non-LTE with abundance corrections that can reach $\sim-0.7\,\dex$. We explore
the effects of atmospheric inhomogeneity by computing a full 3D non-LTE stellar spectrum of KI for
a test star. We find that 3D is necessary to predict a correct shape of the resonance 7698 $\AA$ line,
but the line strength is similar to that found in 1D non-LTE. Our non-LTE abundance corrections reduce
the scatter and change the cosmic trends of literature K abundances. In the regime [Fe/H]$\lesssim-1.0$
the non-LTE abundances show a good agreement with the GCE model with yields from rotating massive
stars. The reduced scatter of the non-LTE corrected abundances of a sample of solar twins shows that
line-by-line differential analysis techniques cannot fully compensate for systematic modelling
errors.
