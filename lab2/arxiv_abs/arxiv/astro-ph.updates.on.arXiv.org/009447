While many tensions between Local Group (LG) satellite galaxies and LCDM cosmology have been alleviated
through recent cosmological simulations, the spatial distribution of satellites remains an important
test of physical models and physical versus numerical disruption in simulations. Using the FIRE-2
cosmological zoom-in baryonic simulations, we examine the radial distributions of satellites
with Mstar > 10^5 Msun around 8 isolated Milky Way- (MW) mass host galaxies and 4 hosts in LG-like pairs.
We demonstrate that these simulations resolve the survival and physical destruction of satellites
with Mstar >~ 10^5 Msun. The simulations broadly agree with LG observations, spanning the radial
profiles around the MW and M31. This agreement does not depend strongly on satellite mass, even at
distances <~ 100 kpc. Host-to-host variation dominates the scatter in satellite counts within
300 kpc of the hosts, while time variation dominates scatter within 50 kpc. More massive host galaxies
within our sample have fewer satellites at small distances, because of enhanced tidal destruction
of satellites via the baryonic disks of host galaxies. Furthermore, we quantify and provide fits
to the tidal depletion of subhalos in baryonic relative to dark matter-only simulations as a function
of distance. Our simulated profiles imply observational incompleteness in the LG even at Mstar
>~ 10^5 Msun: we predict 2-10 such satellites to be discovered around the MW and possibly 6-9 around
M31. To provide cosmological context, we compare our results with the radial profiles of satellites
around MW analogs in the SAGA survey, finding that our simulations are broadly consistent with most
SAGA systems.
