Many photometric time-domain surveys are driven by specific goals, such as searches for supernovae
or transiting exoplanets, which set the cadence with which fields are re-imaged. In the case of the
Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), several sub-surveys are conducted in parallel, leading to non-uniform
sampling over its $\sim$$20,000 \mathrm{deg}^2$ footprint. While the median $7.26 \mathrm{deg}^2$
PTF field has been imaged $\sim$40 times in \textit{R}-band, $\sim$$2300 \mathrm{deg}^2$ have
been observed $>$100 times. We use PTF data to study the trade-off between searching for microlensing
events in a survey whose footprint is much larger than that of typical microlensing searches, but
with far-from-optimal time sampling. To examine the probability that microlensing events can
be recovered in these data, we test statistics used on uniformly sampled data to identify variables
and transients. We find that the von Neumann ratio performs best for identifying simulated microlensing
events in our data. We develop a selection method using this statistic and apply it to data from fields
with $>$10 $R$-band observations, $1.1\times10^9$ light curves, uncovering three candidate
microlensing events. We lack simultaneous, multi-color photometry to confirm these as microlensing
events. However, their number is consistent with predictions for the event rate in the PTF footprint
over the survey's three years of operations, as estimated from near-field microlensing models.
This work can help constrain all-sky event rate predictions and tests microlensing signal recovery
in large data sets, which will be useful to future time-domain surveys, such as that planned with
the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.
