While various observations measured ellipticities of galaxy clusters and alignments between
orientations of the brightest cluster galaxies and their host clusters, there are only a handful
of numerical simulations that implement realistic baryon physics to allow direct comparisons
with those observations. Here we investigate ellipticities of galaxy clusters and alignments
between various components of them and the central galaxies in the state-of-the-art cosmological
hydrodynamical simulation Horizon-AGN, which contains dark matter, stellar, and gas components
in a large simulation box of $(100 h^{-1}$ Mpc$)^3$ with high spatial resolution ($\sim1$ kpc).
We estimate ellipticities of total matter, dark matter, stellar, gas surface mass density distributions,
X-ray surface brightness, and the Compton $y$-parameter of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, as
well as alignments between these components and the central galaxies for 120 projected images of
galaxy clusters with masses $M_{200}>5\times10^{13}M_{\odot}$. Our results indicate that the
distributions of these components are well aligned with the major-axes of the central galaxies,
with the root mean square value of differences of their position angles of $\sim 20^\circ$, which
vary little from inner to the outer regions. We also estimate alignments of these various components
with total matter distributions, and find tighter alignments than those for central galaxies with
the root mean square value of $\sim 15^\circ$. We compare our results with previous observations
of ellipticities and position angle alignments and find reasonable agreements. The comprehensive
analysis presented in this paper provides useful prior information for analyzing stacked lensing
signals as well as designing future observations to study ellipticities and alignments of galaxy
clusters.
