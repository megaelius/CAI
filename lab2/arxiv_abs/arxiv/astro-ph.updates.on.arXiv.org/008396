We present a multi-wavelength study of seven AGN at spectroscopic redshift >2.5 in the 7 Ms Chandra
Deep Field South, selected to have good FIR/sub-mm detections. Our aim is to investigate the possibility
that the obscuration observed in the X-rays can be produced by the interstellar medium (ISM) of the
host galaxy. Based on the 7 Ms Chandra spectra, we measured obscuring column densities N$_{H, X}$
in excess of 7x10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and intrinsic X-ray luminosities L$_{X}$>10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$
for our targets, as well as equivalent widths for the Fe K$\alpha$ emission line EW>0.5-1 keV. We
built the UV-to-FIR spectral energy distributions by using broad-band photometry from CANDELS
and Herschel catalogs. By means of an SED decomposition technique, we derived stellar masses (M$_{*}$~10$^{11}$
Msun), IR luminosities (L$_{IR}$>10$^{12}$ Lsun), star formation rates (SFR~190-1680 Msun yr$^{-1}$)
and AGN bolometric luminosities (L$_{bol}$~10$^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$) for our sample. We used an
empirically-calibrated relation between gas masses and FIR/sub-mm luminosities and derived
M$_{gas}$~0.8-5.4x10$^{10}$ Msun. High-resolution (0.3-0.7'') ALMA data (when available,
CANDELS data otherwise) were used to estimate the galaxy size and hence the volume enclosing most
of the ISM under simple geometrical assumptions. These measurements were then combined to derive
the column density associated with the ISM of the host, on the order of N$_{H, ISM}$~10$^{23-24}$
cm$^{-2}$. The comparison between the ISM column densities and those measured from the X-ray spectral
analysis shows that they are similar. This suggests that, at least at high redshift, significant
absorption on kpc scales by the dense ISM in the host likely adds to or substitutes that produced by
circumnuclear gas on pc scales (i.e., the torus of unified models). The lack of unobscured AGN among
our ISM-rich targets supports this scenario.
