A striking feature of our universe is its near criticality. The cosmological constant and weak hierarchy
problems, as well as the metastability of the electroweak vacuum, can all be understood as problems
of criticality. This suggests a statistical physics approach, based on the string landscape. We
present a dynamical selection mechanism for hospitable vacua based on search optimization. Instead
of focusing on stationary probability distributions, we are interested in the approach to equilibrium.
This is particularly relevant if cosmological evolution has occurred for a time shorter than the
exponentially-long mixing time for the landscape. This imposes a strong selection pressure among
hospitable vacua, favoring those in regions where the search algorithm is efficient. Specifically,
the mean first passage time is minimized for hospitable vacua lying at the bottom of funnel-like
regions, akin to the smooth folding funnels of proteins and the loss functions of well-trained deep
neural networks. The optimality criterion is time-reparametrization invariant and defined by
two competing requirements: search efficiency, which requires minimizing the mean first passage
time, and sweeping exploration, which requires that random walks are recurrent. Optimal landscape
regions reach a compromise by lying at the critical boundary between recurrence and transience,
thereby achieving dynamical criticality. Remarkably, this implies that the optimal lifetime
of vacua coincides with the de Sitter Page time. Our mechanism makes concrete phenomenological
predictions: 1. The expected lifetime of our universe is $10^{130}$ years, which is ~$2\sigma$
from the Standard Model metastability estimate; 2. The SUSY breaking scale should be high, $>10^{10}$
GeV. The present framework suggests a correspondence between the near-criticality of our universe
and non-equilibrium critical phenomena on the landscape.
