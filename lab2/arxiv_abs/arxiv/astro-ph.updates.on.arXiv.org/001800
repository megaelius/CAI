In recent years, the advent of wide-field sky surveys which obtain deep multi-band imaging has presented
a new path for indirectly characterizing the progenitor populations of core-collapse supernovae
(SN): systematic light curve studies. We assemble a set of 76 grizy-band Type IIP SN light curves
from Pan-STARRS1 (PS1), obtained over a constant survey program of 4 years and classified using
both spectroscopy and machine learning-based photometric techniques. We develop and apply a new
Bayesian model for the full multi-band evolution of each light curve in the sample. We find no evidence
for the existence of a discontinuous sub-population of fast-declining explosions (historically
referred to as "Type IIL" SNe). However, we identify a highly significant continuous relation between
the plateau phase decay rate and peak luminosity among our SNe IIP. These results argue in favor of
a single predominant explosion parameter, likely determined by initial stellar mass, controlling
the most significant observational outcomes of red supergiant explosions. We compare each light
curve to physical models from hydrodynamic simulations to estimate progenitor initial masses
and other properties of the PS1 Type IIP SN sample. We show that correction of certain systematic
discrepancies between modeled and observed SN IIP light curve properties, and an expanded grid
of progenitor mass and explosion energy ranges, are needed to enable robust progenitor inferences
from multi-band light curve samples of this kind. This work will serve as a pathfinder for photometric
studies of core-collapse SNe to be conducted through future wide field transient searches.
