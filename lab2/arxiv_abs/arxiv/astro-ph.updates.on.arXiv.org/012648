The formation of planetesimals is an unsolved problem in planet formation theory. A prominent scenario
for overcoming dust growth barriers in dead zones is the gravitational collapse of locally over-dense
regions, shown to robustly produce $\sim$100 km sized objects. Still, the conditions under which
planetesimal formation occurs remain unclear. For collapse to proceed, the self-gravity of an
overdensity must overcome stellar tidal disruption on large scales and turbulent diffusion on
small scales. Here, we relate the scales of streaming and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, which
both regulate particle densities on the scales of gravitational collapse, directly to planetesimal
formation. We support our analytic findings by performing 3D hydrodynamical simulations of streaming
and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and planetesimal formation. We find that the vertical extent
of the particle mid-plane layer and the radial width of streaming instability filaments are set
by the same characteristic length scale, thus governing the strength of turbulent diffusion on
the scales of planetesimal formation. We present and successfully test a collapse criterion: $0.1
Q \beta \epsilon^{-1}Z^{-1} \lesssim 1$ and show that even for Solar metallicities, planetesimals
can form in dead zones of sufficiently massive disks. For a given gas Toomre-parameter $Q$, pressure
gradient $\beta$, metallicity $Z$ and local particle enhancement $\epsilon$, the collapse criterion
also provides a range of unstable scales, instituting a promising path for studying initial planetesimal
mass distributions. Streaming instability is not required for planetesimal collapse, but by increasing
$\epsilon$, can evolve a system to instability.
