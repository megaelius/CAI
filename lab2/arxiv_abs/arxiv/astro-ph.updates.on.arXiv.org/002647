The study of galaxy cluster outskirts has emerged as one of the new frontiers in extragalactic astrophysics
and cosmology with the advent of new observations in X-ray and microwave. However, the thermodynamic
properties and chemical enrichment of this diffuse and azimuthally asymmetric component of the
intracluster medium (ICM) are still not well understood. This work, for the first time, systematically
explores potential observational biases in these regions. To assess X-ray measurements of galaxy
cluster properties at large radii ($>{R}_{500c}$), we use mock Chandra analyses of cosmological
galaxy cluster simulations. The pipeline is identical to that used for Chandra observations, but
the biases discussed in this paper are relevant for all X-ray observations outside of ${R}_{500c}$.
We find the following from our analysis: (1) filament regions can contribute as much as $50\%$ at
$R_{200c}$ to the emission measure; (2) X-ray temperatures and metal abundances from model fitted
mock X-ray spectra in a multi-temperature ICM respectively vary to the level of $10\%$ and $50\%$;
(3) resulting density profiles vary to within $10\%$ out to $R_{200c}$, and gas mass, total mass,
and baryon fractions all vary to within a few percent; (4) the bias from a metal abundance extrapolated
a factor of five higher than the true metal abundance results in total mass measurements biased high
by $20\%$ and total gas measurements biased low by $10\%$; and (5) differences in projection and
dynamical state of a cluster can lead to gas density slope measurements that differ by a factor of
$15\%$ and $30\%$, respectively. The presented results can partially account for some of the recent
gas profile measurements in cluster outskirts by, e.g., Suzaku. Our findings are pertinent to future
X-ray cosmological constraints from cluster outskirts.
