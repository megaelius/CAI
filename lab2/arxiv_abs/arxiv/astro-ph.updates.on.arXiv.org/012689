Models of galaxy formation in a cosmological context predict that massive disk galaxies should
have structured extended stellar halos. Recent studies in integrated light, however, report a
few galaxies, including the nearby disk galaxy M101, that have no measurable stellar halos to the
detection limit. We aim to quantify the stellar content and structure of M101's outskirts by resolving
its stars. We present the photometry of its stars based on deep F606W and F814W images taken with Hubble
Space Telescope as part of the GHOSTS survey. The constructed CMDs of stars reach down to two magnitudes
below the tip of the red giant branch. We derived radial number density profiles of the bright red
giant branch (RGB) stars. The mean color of the RGB stars at $R \sim$ 40 -- 60 kpc is similar to those
of metal-poor globular clusters in the Milky Way. We also derived radial surface brightness profiles
using the public image data provided by the Dragonfly team. Both the radial number density and surface
brightness profiles were converted to radial mass density profiles and combined. We find that the
mass density profiles show a weak upturn at the very outer region, where surface brightness is as
faint as $\mu_g\approx 34$ mag arcsec$^{-1}$. An exponential disk + power-law halo model on the
mass density profiles finds the total stellar halo mass of $M_{halo}=8.2_{-2.2}^{+3.5}\times
10^7M_\odot$. The total stellar halo mass does not exceed $M_{halo} = 3.2 \times 10^8$ $M_{\odot}$
when strongly truncated disk models are considered. Combining the halo mass with the total stellar
mass of M101, we obtain the stellar halo mass fraction of $M_{halo}/M_{gal} = 0.20_{-0.08}^{+0.10}\%$
with an upper limit of 0.78\%. We compare the halo properties of M101 with those of six GHOSTS survey
galaxies as well as the Milky Way and M31 and find that M101 has an anemic stellar halo.
