Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, short-duration radio transients with very high brightness
temperatures implying highly coherent emission. We suggest that the FRBs are caused by the self-focusing
of an electron beam interacting with an ambient plasma right beyond the light cylinder radius of
a neutron star. The magnetic field at the light cylinder radius is relatively high which can accommodate
both young Crab-like systems and old millisecond pulsars addressing the diverse environments
of FRBs. At the first stage, the intense pulsed-beam passing through the background plasma causes
instabilities such that the trapped particles in local Buneman-type cavitons saturate the local
field. The beam is then radially self-focused due to the circular electric field developed by the
two-stream instability which leads to Weibel instability in the transverse direction. Finally,
the non-linear saturation of the Weibel instability results in the self-modulational formation
of solitons due to plasmoid instability. The resonant solitary waves are the breather-type solitons
hosting relativistic particles with self-excited oscillations. The analytical solutions obtained
for non-linear dispersion and solitons suggest that, near the current sheets, the relativistic
bunches are accelerated/amplified by klystron-like structures due to self-excited oscillations
by the induced local electric field. Boosted coherent radio emission propagates through a narrow
cone with strong focusing due to radial electric field and magnetic pinching. The non-linear evolution
of solitons and the stimulated emission are associated with the Buneman instability and the possibility
of the presence of nanosecond shots in FRBs are investigated.
