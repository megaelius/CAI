Absorption line spectroscopy is a powerful way of measuring properties of stars and the interstellar
medium. Absorption spectra are often analyzed manually, an approach that limits reproducibility
and which cannot practically be applied to modern datasets consisting of thousands or even millions
of spectra. Simultaneous probabilistic modeling of absorption features and continuum shape is
a promising approach for automating this analysis. Existing implementations of this approach
use numerical methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to marginalize over the continuum
parameters. Numerical marginalization over large numbers of continuum parameters is too slow
to be convenient for exploratory analysis, can increase the dimensionality of an inference problem
beyond the capacity of simple MCMC samplers, and is in general impractical for the analysis of large
datasets. When continua are parameterized as linear functions such as polynomials or splines,
it is possible to reduce continuum parameter marginalization to an integral over a multivariate
normal distribution, which has a known closed form. In addition to speeding up probabilistic modeling,
analytic marginalization makes it trivial to marginalize over continuum parameterizations and
to combine continuum description marginalization with optimization for absorption line parameters.
These new possibilities allow automatic, probabilistically justified continuum placement in
analyses of large spectroscopic datasets. We compare the accuracy to within which absorption line
parameters can be recovered using different continuum placement methods and find that marginalization
is in many cases an improvement over other methods. We implement analytic marginalization over
linear continuum parameters in the open-source package amlc.
