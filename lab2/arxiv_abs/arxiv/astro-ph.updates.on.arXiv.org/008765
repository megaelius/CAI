Observations of isolated neutron stars place constraints on the equation of state (EOS) of cold,
neutron-rich matter, while nuclear physics experiments probe the EOS of hot, symmetric matter.
Many dynamical phenomena, such as core-collapse supernovae, the formation and cooling of proto-neutron
stars, and neutron star mergers, lie between these two regimes and depend on the EOS at finite temperatures
for matter with varying proton fractions. In this paper, we introduce a new framework to accurately
calculate the thermal pressure of neutron-proton-electron matter at arbitrary density, temperature,
and proton fraction. This framework can be expressed using a set of five physically-motivated parameters
that span a narrow range of values for realistic EOS and are able to capture the leading-order effects
of degenerate matter on the thermal pressure. We base two of these parameters on a new approximation
of the Dirac effective mass, with which we reproduce the thermal pressure to within <~30% for a variety
of realistic EOS at densities of interest. Three additional parameters, based on the behavior of
the symmetry energy near the nuclear saturation density, allow for the extrapolation of any cold
EOS in beta-equilibrium to arbitrary proton fractions. Our model thus allows a user to extend any
cold nucleonic EOS, including piecewise-polytropes, to arbitrary temperature and proton fraction,
for use in calculations and numerical simulations of astrophysical phenomena. We find that our
formalism is able to reproduce realistic finite-temperature EOS with errors of <~20% and offers
a 1-3 orders-of-magnitude improvement over existing ideal-fluid models.
