The study of variations in solar activity is important for understanding the underlying mechanism
of solar activity and for predicting the level of activity in view of the activity impact on space
weather and global climate. Here we have used the amplitudes (the peak values of the 13-month smoothed
international sunspot number) of Solar Cycles 1-24 to predict the relative amplitudes of the solar
cycles during the rising phase of the upcoming Gleissberg cycle. We fitted a cosine function to the
amplitudes and times of the solar cycles after subtracting a linear fit of the amplitudes. The best
cosine fit shows overall properties (periods, maxima, minima, etc.) of Gleissberg cycles, but
with large uncertainties. We obtain a pattern of the rising phase of the upcoming Gleissberg cycle,
but there is considerable ambiguity. Using the epochs of violations of the Gnevyshev-Ohl rule (G-O
rule) and the `tentative inverse G-O rule' of solar cycles during the period 1610-2015, and also
using the epochs where the orbital angular momentum of the Sun is steeply decreased during the period
1600-2099, we infer that Solar Cycle 25 will be weaker than Cycle 24. Cycles 25 and 26 will have almost
same strength, and their epochs are at the minimum between the current and upcoming Gleissberg cycles.
In addition, Cycle 27 is expected to be stronger than Cycle 26 and weaker than Cycle 28, and Cycle 29
is expected to be stronger than both Cycles 28 and 30. The maximum of Cycle 29 is expected to represent
the next Gleissberg maximum. Our analysis also suggests a much lower value (30-40) for the maximum
amplitude of the upcoming Cycle 25.
