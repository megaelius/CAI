We present a detailed study of the faint Milky Way satellite Draco II (Dra II) from deep CFHT/MegaCam
broadband $g$ and $i$ photometry and narrow-band metallicity-sensitive CaHK observations, along
with follow-up Keck II/DEIMOS multi-object spectroscopy. Forward modeling of the deep photometry
allows us to refine the structural and photometric properties of Dra II: the distribution of stars
in colour-magnitude space implies Dra II is old (13.5 $ \pm 0.5 $ Gyr), very metal poor, very faint
($ L_V = 180 ^{+124}_{-72} L_\odot $), and at a distance $d = 21.5 \pm 0.4$ kpc. The narrow-band, metallicity-sensitive
CaHK Pristine photometry confirms this very low metallicity ([Fe/H]$ = -2.7 \pm 0.1$ dex). Even
though our study benefits from a doubling of the spectroscopic sample size compared to previous
investigations, the velocity dispersion of the system is still only marginally resolved ($\sigma_{vr}<5.9$
km s$^{-1}$ at the 95 per cent confidence level) and confirms that Dra II is a dynamically cold stellar
system with a large recessional velocity ($\langle v_{r}\rangle = -342.5^{+1.1}_{-1.2} $ km s$^{-1}$).
We further show that the spectroscopically confirmed members of Dra~II have a mean proper motion
of $(\mu_\alpha^*,\mu_\delta)=(1.26 \pm 0.27,0.94 \pm 0.28) $ mas yr$^{-1}$ in the Gaia DR2 data,
which translates to an orbit with a pericenter and an apocenter of $21.3 ^{+0.7}_{-1.0}$ and $153.8
^{+56.7}_{-34.7}$ kpc, respectively. Taken altogether, these properties favour the scenario
of Dra~II being a potentially disrupting dwarf galaxy. The low-significance extra-tidal features
we map around the satellite tentatively support this scenario.
