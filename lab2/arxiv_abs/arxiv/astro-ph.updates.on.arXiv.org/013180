In this paper we focus on understanding the physical processes that lead to stable or unstable ionization
fronts (I-fronts) observed in simulations of moving black holes (BHs). The front instability may
trigger bursts of gas accretion accelerating the growth of supermassive BH seeds and rendering
the BH significantly more luminous than at steady-state. We perform a series of idealized three
dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations resolving the I-fronts around BHs of mass $M_\mathrm{BH}$
and velocity $v_\infty$ accreting from a medium of density $n_\mathrm{H}$. The I-front, with radius
$R_\mathrm{I}$, transitions from D-type to R-type as the BH velocity becomes larger than a critical
value $v_\mathrm{R}\sim 30-55\,\mathrm{km/s}$. The D-type front is preceded by a bow-shock of
thickness $\Delta R_\mathrm{I}$ that decreases as $v_\infty$ approaches $v_\mathrm{R}$. We
find that both D-type and R-type fronts can be unstable given the following two conditions: i) for
D-type fronts the shell thickness must be $\Delta R_\mathrm{I}/R_\mathrm{I}<0.05$ (i.e., $v_\infty
\geq 20-30\,\mathrm{km/s}$.), while no similar restriction holds for R-type fronts; ii) the temperature
jump across the I-front must be $\Delta_T \equiv T_\mathrm{II}/T_\mathrm{I}>3$. This second
condition is satisfied if $T_\mathrm{I}<5000\,\mathrm{K}$ or if $n_\mathrm{H}\,M_\mathrm{BH}
\gtrsim 10^6\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. Due to X-ray pre-heating typically $T_\mathrm{I}
\sim 10^4\,\mathrm{K}$, unless the D-type shell is optically thick to X-rays, which also happens
when $n_\mathrm{H}\,M_\mathrm{BH}$ is greater than a metallicity-dependent critical value.
We thus conclude that I-fronts around BHs are unstable only for relatively massive BHs ($>10^2-10^4\,M_\odot$)
moving trough very dense molecular clouds.
