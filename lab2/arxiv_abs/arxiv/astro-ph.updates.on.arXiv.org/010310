We report a multiplanetary system found from the analysis of microlensing event OGLE-2018-BLG-1011,
for which the light curve exhibits a double-bump anomaly around the peak. We find that the anomaly
cannot be fully explained by the binary-lens or binary-source interpretations and its description
requires the introduction of an additional lens component. The 3L1S (3 lens components and a single
source) modeling yields three sets of solutions, in which one set of solutions indicates that the
lens is a planetary system in a binary, while the other two sets imply that the lens is a multiplanetary
system. By investigating the fits of the individual models to the detailed light curve structure,
we find that the multiple-planet solution with planet-to-host mass ratios $\sim 9.5\times 10^{-3}$
and $\sim 15\times 10^{-3}$ are favored over the other solutions. From the Bayesian analysis, we
find that the lens is composed of two planets with masses $1.8^{+3..4}_{-1.1}~M_{\rm J}$ and $2.8^{+5.1}_{-1.7}~M_{\rm
J}$ around a host with a mass $0.18^{+0.33}_{-0.10}~M_\odot$ and located at a distance $7.1^{+1.1}_{-1.5}~{\rm
kpc}$. The estimated distance indicates that the lens is the farthest system among the known multiplanetary
systems. The projected planet-host separations are $a_{\perp,2}=1.8^{+2.1}_{-1.5}~{\rm au}$
($0.8^{+0.9}_{-0.6}~{\rm au}$) and $a_{\perp,3}=0.8^{+0.9}_{-0.6}~{\rm au}$, where the values
of $a_{\perp,2}$ in and out the parenthesis are the separations corresponding to the two degenerate
solutions, indicating that both planets are located beyond the snow line of the host, as with the
other four multiplanetary systems previously found by microlensing.
