We report the confirmation and mass determination of three hot Jupiters discovered by the Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission: HIP 65Ab (TOI-129, TIC-201248411) is an ultra-short-period
Jupiter orbiting a bright (V=11.1 mag) K4-dwarf every 0.98 days. It is a massive 3.213 +/- 0.078 Mjup
planet in a grazing transit configuration with an impact parameter of b = 1.17 +0.10/-0.08. As a result
the radius is poorly constrained, 2.03 +0.61/-0.49 Rjup. The planet's distance to its host star
is less than twice the separation at which it would be destroyed by Roche lobe overflow. It is expected
to spiral into HIP 65A on a timescale ranging from 80 Myr to a few gigayears, assuming a reduced tidal
dissipation quality factor of Qs' = 10^7 - 10^9. We performed a full phase-curve analysis of the TESS
data and detected both illumination- and ellipsoidal variations as well as Doppler boosting. HIP
65A is part of a binary stellar system, with HIP 65B separated by 269 AU (3.95 arcsec on sky). TOI-157b
(TIC 140691463) is a typical hot Jupiter with a mass of 1.18 +/- 0.13 Mjup and a radius of 1.29 +/- 0.02
Rjup. It has a period of 2.08 days, which corresponds to a separation of just 0.03 AU. This makes TOI-157
an interesting system, as the host star is an evolved G9 sub-giant star (V=12.7). TOI-169b (TIC 183120439)
is a bloated Jupiter orbiting a V=12.4 G-type star. It has a mass of 0.79 +/- 0.06 Mjup and a radius of
1.09 +0.08/-0.05 Rjup. Despite having the longest orbital period (P = 2.26 days) of the three planets,
TOI-169b receives the most irradiation and is situated on the edge of the Neptune desert. All three
host stars are metal rich with [Fe/H] ranging from 0.18 - 0.24.
