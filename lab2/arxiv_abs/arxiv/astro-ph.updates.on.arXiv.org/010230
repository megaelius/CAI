The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) array that comprises
millimeter- and submillimeter-wavelength telescopes separated by distances comparable to the
diameter of the Earth. At a nominal operating wavelength of ~1.3 mm, EHT angular resolution (lambda/D)
is ~25 micro-as, which is sufficient to resolve nearby supermassive black hole candidates on spatial
and temporal scales that correspond to their event horizons. With this capability, the EHT scientific
goals are to probe general relativistic effects in the strong-field regime and to study accretion
and relativistic jet formation near the black hole boundary. In this Letter we describe the system
design of the EHT, detail the technology and instrumentation that enable observations, and provide
measures of its performance. Meeting the EHT science objectives has required several key developments
that have facilitated the robust extension of the VLBI technique to EHT observing wavelengths and
the production of instrumentation that can be deployed on a heterogeneous array of existing telescopes
and facilities. To meet sensitivity requirements, high-bandwidth digital systems were developed
that process data at rates of 64 gigabit/s, exceeding those of currently operating cm-wavelength
VLBI arrays by more than an order of magnitude. Associated improvements include the development
of phasing systems at array facilities, new receiver installation at several sites, and the deployment
of hydrogen maser frequency standards to ensure coherent data capture across the array. These efforts
led to the coordination and execution of the first Global EHT observations in 2017 April, and to event-horizon-scale
imaging of the supermassive black hole candidate in M87.
