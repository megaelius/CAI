We investigate the contribution to the formation of type Ia supernovae of the single (a white dwarf
accreting from a non-degenerate companion) and double (two merging white dwarfs) degenerate scenario,
as well as various aspects of the binary evolution process leading to such a progenitor system. We
aim to get a better insight into uncertainties and parameter spaces by means of a combined modelization,
resulting in a reduction of the number of possible model approaches. This exclusion of parts of the
parameter space is, as will be shown, often independent of uncertainties in the modelization. We
use the combination of a population synthesis code with detailed binary evolution and a galactic
chemical evolution model to predict the metallicity distribution of G-type dwarfs in the solar
neighborhood. Because of the very long lifetime of these stars, this distribution is a good indicator
of the entire chemical history of a region. By comparing the observed distribution with those predicted
by assuming different type Ia supernova progenitors and evolutionary parameters (e.g. concerning
mass and angular momentum loss and common envelope evolution), it is possible to constrain the possible
combinations of assumptions. We find that in order to reproduce the observed G-dwarf metallicity
distribution, it is absolutely necessary to include both the single and double degenerate scenario.
The best match is obtained when all merging C-O white dwarfs contribute to the latter. The correspondence
is also critically dependent on the assumptions about galaxy and star formation, e.g. the use of
the two-infall model vs. a constant star formation rate. However, this does not affect the previous
conclusion, which is consistent with the results obtained by investigating type Ia supernova delay
time distributions in starburst galaxies.
