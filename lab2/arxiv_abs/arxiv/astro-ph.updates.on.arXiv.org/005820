Much attention has been placed on the dust distribution in protostellar envelopes, but there are
still many unanswered questions regarding the structure of the gas. We aim to start identifying
the factors that determine the chemical structure of protostellar regions, by studying and comparing
low-mass embedded systems in key molecular tracers. The cold and warm chemical structures of two
embedded Class 0 systems, IRAS16293 and VLA1623 are characterized through interferometric observations.
DCO+, N2H+ and N2D+ are used to trace the spatial distribution and physics of the cold regions of the
envelope, while c-C3H2 and C2H from models of the chemistry are expected to trace the warm (UV-irradiated)
regions. Both sources show a number of striking similarities and differences. DCO+ consistently
traces the cold material at the disk-envelope interface, where gas and dust temperatures are lowered
due to disk shadowing. N2H+ and N2D+, also tracing cold gas, show low abundances towards VLA1623,
but for IRAS16293, the distribution of N2D+ is consistent with the same chemical models that reproduce
DCO+. c-C3H2 and C2H show different spatial distributions for the two systems. For IRAS16293, c-C3H2
traces the outflow cavity wall, while C2H is found in the envelope material but not the outflow cavity
wall. In contrast, toward VLA1623 both molecules trace the outflow cavity wall. Finally, hot core
molecules are abundantly observed toward IRAS16293 but not toward VLA1623. We identify temperature
as one of the key factors in determining the chemical structure of protostars as seen in gaseous molecules.
More luminous protostars, such as IRAS16293, will have chemical complexity out to larger distances
than colder protostars, such as VLA1623. Additionally, disks in the embedded phase have a crucial
role in controlling both the gas and dust temperature of the envelope, and consequently the chemical
structure.
