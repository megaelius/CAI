We present the efficiency of near-infrared reflective ruled diffraction gratings designed for
the InfraRed Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). IRIS is a first light, integral field spectrograph and
imager for the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) and narrow field infrared adaptive optics system (NFIRAOS).
We present our experimental setup and analysis of the efficiency of selected reflective diffraction
gratings. These measurements are used as a comparison sample against selected candidate Volume
Phase Holographic (VPH) gratings (see Chen et al., this conference). We investigate the efficiencies
of five ruled gratings designed for IRIS from two separate vendors. Three of the gratings accept
a bandpass of 1.19-1.37 {\mu}m (J band) with ideal spectral resolutions of R=4000 and R=8000, groove
densities of 249 and 516 lines/mm, and blaze angles of 9.86 and 20.54 degrees, respectively. The
other two gratings accept a bandpass of 1.51-1.82 {\mu}m (H Band) with an ideal spectral resolution
of R=4000, groove density of 141 lines/mm, and blaze angle of 9.86{\deg}. We measure the efficiencies
off blaze angle for all gratings and the efficiencies between the polarization transverse magnetic
(TM) and transverse electric (TE) states. The peak reflective efficiencies are 98.90 +/- 3.36%
(TM) and 84.99 +/- 2.74% (TM) for the H-band R=4000 and J-band R=4000 respectively. The peak reflective
efficiency for the J-band R=8000 grating is 78.78 +/- 2.54% (TE). We find that these ruled gratings
do not exhibit a wide dependency on incident angle within +/-3{\deg}. Our best-manufactured gratings
were found to exhibit a dependency on the polarization state of the incident beam with a ~10-20% deviation,
consistent with the theoretical efficiency predictions.
