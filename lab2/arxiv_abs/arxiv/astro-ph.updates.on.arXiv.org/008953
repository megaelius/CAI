A classic application of coronal seismology uses transverse oscillations of waveguides to obtain
estimates of the magnetic field strength. The procedure requires information on the density of
the structures. Often, it ignores the damping of the oscillations. We computed marginal posteriors
for parameters such as the waveguide density; the density contrast; the transverse inhomogeneity
length-scale; and the magnetic field strength, under the assumption that the oscillations can
be modelled as standing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) kink modes damped by resonant absorption. Our
results show that the magnetic field strength can be properly inferred, even if the densities inside
and outside the structure are largely unknown. Incorporating observational estimates of plasma
density further constrains the obtained posteriors. The amount of information one is willing to
include (a priori) for the density and the density contrast influences their corresponding posteriors,
but very little the inferred magnetic field strength. The decision to include or leave out the information
on the damping and the damping time-scales have a minimal impact on the obtained magnetic field strength.
In contrast to the classic method which provides with numerical estimates with error bars or possible
ranges of variation for the magnetic field strength, Bayesian methods offer the full distribution
of plausibility over the considered range of possible values. The methods are applied to available
datasets of observed transverse loop oscillations, can be extended to prominence fine structures
or chromospheric spicules and implemented to propagating waves in addition to standing oscillations.
