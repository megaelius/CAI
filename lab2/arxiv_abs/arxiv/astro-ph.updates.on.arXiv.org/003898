The intriguing WN4b star WR6 has been known to display epoch-dependent spectroscopic, photometric
and polarimetric variability for several decades. In this paper, we set out to verify if a simplified
analytical model in which Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) threading an otherwise spherical
wind is able to reproduce the many broadband continuum light curves from the literature with a reasonable
set of parameters. We modified the optically thin model we developed in Ignace, St-Louis & Proulx-Giraldeau
(2015) to approximately account for multiple scattering and used it to fit 13 separate datasets
of this star. By including two CIRs in the wind, we obtained reasonable fits for all datasets with
coherent values for the inclination of the rotation axis ($i_0=166^{\circ}$) and for its orientation
in the plane of the sky, although in the latter case we obtained two equally acceptable values ($\psi=63^{\circ}$
and $\psi=152^{\circ}$) from the polarimetry. Additional line profile variation simulations
using the Sobolev approximation for the line transfer allowed us to eliminate the $\psi=152^{\circ}$
solution. With the adopted configuration ($i_0=166^{\circ}$ and $\psi=63^{\circ}$), we were
able to reproduce all datasets relatively well with two CIRs located near the stellar equator and
always separated by $\sim 90^{\circ}$ in longitude. The epoch-dependency comes from the fact that
these CIRs migrate along the surface of the star. Density contrasts smaller than a factor of two and
large opening angles for the CIR ($\beta \geq 35^{\circ}$) were found to best reproduce the type
of spectroscopic variability reported in the literature.
