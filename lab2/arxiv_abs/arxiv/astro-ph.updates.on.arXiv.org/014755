We want to investigate whether we can use Lyalpha emission to obtain information on the environment
properties and whether Lyalpha emitters show different characteristics as a function of their
environment. We estimated local densities in the VANDELS Chandra Deep Field-South (CDFS) and UKIDSS
Ultra Deep Survey (UDS) fields, by using a three-dimensional algorithm which works in the RA-dec-redshift
space. We selected a sample of 131 Lyalpha-emitting galaxies (EW(Lyalpha)>0 A), unbiased with
respect to environmental density, to study their location with respect to the over- or under-dense
environment. We identify 13 (proto)cluster candidates in the CDFS and nine in the UDS at 2<z<4, based
on photometric and spectroscopic redshifts from VANDELS and from all the available literature.
No significant difference is observed in the rest-frame U-V color between field and galaxies located
within the identified overdensities. We find that VANDELS Lyalpha emitters (LAEVs) lie preferentially
outside of overdense regions as the majority of the galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from
VANDELS. The LAEVs in overdense regions tend to have low Lyalpha equivalent widths and low specific
SFRs, and they also tend to be more massive than the LAEVs in the field. Their stacked Lyalpha profile
shows a dominant red peak and a hint of a blue peak. Our results show that LAEVs are likely to be influenced
by the environment and favour a scenario with outflows of low expansion velocities and high HI column
densities for galaxies in overdense regions. An outflow with low expansion velocity could be related
to the way galaxies are forming stars in overdense regions; the high HI column density can be a consequence
of the gravitational potential of the overdensity. Therefore, Lyalpha-emitting galaxies can
provide useful insights on the environment in which they reside.
