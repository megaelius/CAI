We explore the production and escape of ionizing photons in young galaxies by investigating the
ultraviolet and optical emission-line properties of models of ionization-bounded and density-bounded
HII regions, active-galactic-nucleus (AGN) narrow-line regions and radiative shocks computed
all using the same physically-consistent description of element abundances and depletion on to
dust grains down to very low metallicities. We compare these models with a reference sample of metal-poor
star-forming galaxies and Lyman-continuum (LyC) leakers at various redshifts, which allows the
simultaneous exploration of more spectral diagnostics than typically available at once for individual
subsamples. We confirm that current single- and binary-star population synthesis models do not
produce hard-enough radiation to account for the high-ionization emission of the most metal-poor
galaxies. Introducing either an AGN or radiative-shock component brings models into agreement
with observations. A published model including X-ray binaries is an attractive alternative to
reproduce the observed rise in HeII4686/Hbeta ratio with decreasing oxygen abundance in metal-poor
star-forming galaxies, but not the high observed HeII4686/Hbeta ratios of galaxies with large
EW(Hbeta). A source of harder ionizing radiation appears to be required in these extreme objects,
such as an AGN or radiative-shock component, perhaps linked to an initial-mass-function bias toward
massive stars at low metallicity. This would also account for the surprisingly high [OI]/[OIII]
ratios of confirmed LyC leakers relative to ionization-bounded models. We find no simple by-eye
diagnostic of the nature of ionizing sources and the escape of LyC photon, which require proper simultaneous
fits of several lines to be discriminated against.
