The search for heavily obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has been revitalized in the last five
years by NuSTAR, which has provided a good census and spectral characterization of a population
of such objects, mostly at low redshift, thanks to its enhanced sensitivity above 10 keV compared
to previous X-ray facilities, and its hard X-ray imaging capabilities. We aim at demonstrating
how NGC2785, a local (z=0.009) star-forming galaxy, is responsible, in virtue of its heavily obscured
active nucleus, for significant contamination in the non-imaging BeppoSAX/PDS data of the relatively
nearby (~17 arcmin) quasar IRAS 09104+4109 (z=0.44), which was originally mis-classified as Compton
thick. We analyzed ~71 ks NuSTAR data of NGC2785 using the MYTorus model and provided a physical description
of the X-ray properties of the source for the first time. We found that NGC2785 hosts a heavily obscured
(NH~3*10^{24} cm^{-2}) nucleus. The intrinsic X-ray luminosity of the source, once corrected
for the measured obscuration (L(2-10 keV)~10^{42} erg/s), is consistent within a factor of a few
with predictions based on the source mid-infrared flux using widely adopted correlations from
the literature. Based on NuSTAR data and previous indications from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory
(BAT instrument), we confirm that NGC2785, because of its hard X-ray emission and spectral shape,
was responsible for at least one third of the 20-100 keV emission observed using the PDS instrument
onboard BeppoSAX, originally completely associated with IRAS 09104+4109. Such emission led to
the erroneous classification of this source as a Compton-thick quasar, while it is now recognized
as Compton thin.
