Complex organic molecules are readily detected in the inner regions of the gaseous envelopes of
forming protostars. In particular, molecules that contain nitrogen are interesting due to the
role nitrogen plays in the development of life and the compact scales such molecules have been found
to trace around forming protostars. The goal of this work is to determine the inventory of one family
of nitrogen-bearing organic molecules, complex nitriles (molecules with a $-$CN functional group)
towards two hot corino sources in the low-mass protostellar binary IRAS 16293$-$2422. This work
explores the abundance differences between the two sources, the isotopic ratios, and the spatial
extent derived from molecules containing the nitrile functional group. Using data from the Protostellar
Interferometric Line Survey (PILS) obtained with ALMA we determine abundances and excitation
temperatures for the detected nitriles. We also present a new method for determining the spatial
structure of sources with high line density and large velocity gradients $-$ Velocity-corrected
INtegrated emission (VINE) maps. We detect methyl cyanide (CH$_3$CN) as well as 5 of its isotopologues,
including the detection of CHD$_2$CN which is the first detection in the ISM. We also detect ethyl
cyanide (C$_2$H$_5$CN), vinyl cyanide (C$_2$H$_3$CN), and cyanoacetylene (HC$_3$N). We find
that abundances are similar between IRAS 16293A and IRAS 16293B on small scales except for vinyl
cyanide which is only detected towards the latter source. This suggests an important difference
between the sources either in their evolutionary stage or warm-up timescales. We also detect a spatially
double-peaked emission for the first time in molecular emission in the A source, suggesting that
this source is showing structure related to a rotating toroid of material.
