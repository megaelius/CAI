The origin of small-scale interplanetary magnetic flux-ropes (SIMFRs) and the relationship between
SIMFRs and magnetic clouds (MCs) are still controversial. In this study, two populations of SMIFRs
were collected, i.e., SIMFRs originating from the Sun (SIMFR-SUN) and those originating from the
solar wind (SIMFR-SW). We defined the SIMFR-SUN (SIMFR-SW) as the SMIFRs that include (exclude)
the counter-streaming suprathermal electrons and stay away from (close to) the heliospheric current
sheet. After fitting with force-free flux-rope model, 52 SIMFR-SUN and 57 SIMFR-SW events observed
by Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) from 1998 February to 2011 August were qualified. Using
the approach of relating the measurements to their spatial position within the flux-ropes, a comparative
survey of plasma and composition characteristics inside the two populations of SIMFRs is presented.
Results show that the two populations of SIMFRs have apparent differences. Compared with SIMFR-SW,
SIMFR-SUN are MC-like, featuring lower central proton density, higher Vrad, higher low-FIP element
abundances, higher and more fluctuate average ion charge-states and the ion chargestate ratios
which are related to the heating in low corona. In addition, for the ion charge-state distributions
inside SIMFR-SUN, the sunward side is higher than earthward, which might be caused by the flare heating
during eruption. Moreover, both SIMFR-SUN and MCs show anti-correlation between plasma beta and
He/P trend. These characteristics indicate that SIMFR-SUN and MCs are very likely to have the identical
origination. This study supports the two-source origin of SIMFRs, i.e., the solar corona and the
solar wind.
