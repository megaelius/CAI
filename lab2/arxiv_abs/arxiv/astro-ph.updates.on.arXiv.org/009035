Some atmospheric gases have been proposed as counter indicators to the presence of life on an exoplanet
if remotely detectable at sufficient abundance (i.e., antibiosignatures), informing the search
for biosignatures and potentially fingerprinting uninhabited habitats. However, the quantitative
extent to which putative antibiosignatures could exist in the atmospheres of inhabited planets
is not well understood. The most commonly referenced potential antibiosignature is CO, because
it represents a source of free energy and reduced carbon that is readily exploited by life on Earth
and is thus often assumed to accumulate only in the absence of life. Yet, biospheres actively produce
CO through biomass burning, photooxidation processes, and release of gases that are photochemically
converted into CO in the atmosphere. We demonstrate with a 1D ecosphere-atmosphere model that reducing
biospheres can maintain CO levels of ~100 ppmv even at low H2 fluxes due to the impact of hybrid photosynthetic
ecosystems. Additionally, we show that photochemistry around M dwarf stars is particularly favorable
for the buildup of CO, with plausible concentrations for inhabited, oxygen-rich planets extending
from hundreds of ppm to several percent. Since CH4 buildup is also favored on these worlds, and because
O2 and O3 are likely not detectable with the James Webb Space Telescope, the presence of high CO (>100
ppmv) may discriminate between oxygen-rich and reducing biospheres with near-future transmission
observations. These results suggest that spectroscopic detection of CO can be compatible with
the presence of life and that a comprehensive contextual assessment is required to validate the
significance of potential antibiosignatures.
