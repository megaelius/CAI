Diagnostics of polarized emission provide us with valuable information on the Galactic magnetic
field and the state of turbulence in the interstellar medium, which cannot be obtained from synchrotron
intensity alone. In Paper I (Herron et al. 2017b), we derived polarization diagnostics that are
rotationally and translationally invariant in the $Q$-$U$ plane, similar to the polarization
gradient. In this paper, we apply these diagnostics to simulations of ideal magnetohydrodynamic
turbulence that have a range of sonic and Alfv\'enic Mach numbers. We generate synthetic images
of Stokes $Q$ and $U$ for these simulations, for the cases where the turbulence is illuminated from
behind by uniform polarized emission, and where the polarized emission originates from within
the turbulent volume. From these simulated images we calculate the polarization diagnostics derived
in Paper I, for different lines of sight relative to the mean magnetic field, and for a range of frequencies.
For all of our simulations, we find that the polarization gradient is very similar to the generalized
polarization gradient, and that both trace spatial variations in the magnetoionic medium for the
case where emission originates within the turbulent volume, provided that the medium is not supersonic.
We propose a method for distinguishing the cases of emission coming from behind or within a turbulent,
Faraday rotating medium, and a method to partly map the rotation measure of the observed region.
We also speculate on statistics of these diagnostics that may allow us to constrain the physical
properties of an observed turbulent region.
