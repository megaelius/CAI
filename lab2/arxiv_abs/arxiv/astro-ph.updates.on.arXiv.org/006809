Powerful quasars can be seen out to large distances. As they reside in massive dark matter haloes,
they provide a useful tracer of large scale structure. We stack Herschel-SPIRE images at 250, 350
and 500 microns at the location of 11,235 quasars in ten redshift bins spanning $0.5 \leq z \leq 3.5$.
The unresolved dust emission of the quasar and its host galaxy dominate on instrumental beam scales,
while extended emission is spatially resolved on physical scales of order a megaparsec. This emission
is due to dusty star-forming galaxies clustered around the dark matter haloes hosting quasars.
We measure radial surface brightness profiles of the stacked images to compute the angular correlation
function of dusty star-forming galaxies correlated with quasars. We then model the profiles to
determine large scale clustering properties of quasars and dusty star-forming galaxies as a function
of redshift. We adopt a halo model and parameterize it by the most effective halo mass at hosting star-forming
galaxies, finding $\log(M_\mathrm{eff}/M_{\odot}) = 13.8^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$ at $z=2.21-2.32$,
and, at $z=0.5-0.81$, the mass is $\log(M_\mathrm{eff}/M_{\odot}) = 10.7^{+1.0}_{-0.2}$. Our
results indicate a downsizing of dark matter haloes hosting dusty star-forming galaxies between
$0.5 \leq z \leq 2.9$. The derived dark matter halo masses are consistent with other measurements
of star-forming and sub-millimeter galaxies. The physical properties of dusty star-forming galaxies
inferred from the halo model depend on details of the quasar halo occupation distribution in ways
that we explore at $z>2.5$, where the quasar HOD parameters are not well constrained.
