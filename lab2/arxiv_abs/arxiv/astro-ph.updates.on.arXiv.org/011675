Short-lived radionuclides (SLRs) with mean-lives $\tau$ of a few to hundreds Myr provide unique
opportunities to probe recent nucleosynthesis events in the interstellar medium, and the physical
conditions in which the Sun formed. Here we quantify the uncertainty in the predicted evolution
of SLRs within a parcel of interstellar gas given the stochastic nature of stellar enrichment events.
We assume that an enrichment progenitor is formed at every time interval $\gamma$. For each progenitor,
we randomly sample the delay time between its formation and its enrichment event, based on several
delay-time distribution (DTD) functions that cover a wide range of astrophysical sites. For each
set of $\tau$, $\gamma$, and DTD function, we follow the abundances of SLRs for 15 Gyr, and repeat
this process thousands of times to derive their probability distributions. For $\tau/\gamma\gtrsim2$,
the distributions depend on the DTD function and we provide tabulated values and analytical expressions
to quantify the spread. The relative abundance uncertainty reaches a maximum of $\sim$ 60% for $\tau/\gamma=1$.
For $\tau/\gamma\lesssim1$, we provide the probability for the SLR abundance to carry the signature
of only one enrichment event, which is greater than 50% when $\tau/\gamma\lesssim0.3$. For $0.3\lesssim\tau/\gamma\lesssim
2$, a small number of events contributed to the SLR abundance. This case needs to be investigated
with a separate statistical method. We find that an isolation time for the birth of the Sun of roughly
$9-13$ Myr is consistent with the observed abundances of $^{60}$Fe, $^{107}$Pd, and $^{182}$Hf
in the early Solar System, when assuming $\tau/\gamma\sim3$ for these isotopes.
