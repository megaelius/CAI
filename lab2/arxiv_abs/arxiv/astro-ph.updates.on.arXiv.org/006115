We develop analytic approximations to the density evolution of prestellar cores, based on the results
of hydrodynamical simulations. We use these approximations as input for a time-dependent gas-grain
chemical code to investigate the effects of differing modes of collapse on the molecular abundances
in the core. We confirm that our method can provide reasonable agreement with an exact numerical
solution of both the hydrodynamics and chemistry while being significantly less computationally
expensive, allowing a large grid of models varying multiple input parameters to be run. We present
results using this method to illustrate how the chemistry is affected not only by the collapse model
adopted, but also by the large number of unknown physical and chemical parameters. Models which
are initially gravitationally unstable predict similar abundances despite differing densities
and collapse timescales, while ambipolar diffusion produces more extended inner depleted regions
which are not seen in observations of prestellar cores. Molecular observations are capable of discriminating
between modes of collapse despite the unknown values of various input parameters. We also investigate
the evolution of the ambipolar diffusion timescale for a range of collapse modes, metallicities
and cosmic ray ionization rates, finding that it remains comparable to or larger than the collapse
timescale during the initial stages for all models we consider, but becomes smaller at later evolutionary
stages. This confirms that ambipolar diffusion is an important process for diffuse gas, but becomes
less significant as cores collapse to higher densities.
