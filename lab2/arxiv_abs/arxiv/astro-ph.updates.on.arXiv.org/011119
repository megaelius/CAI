We explore differences in Galactic halo kinematic properties derived from two commonly employed
Galactic potentials: the St$\ddot{a}$ckel potential and the default Milky Way-like potential
used in the "Galpy" package (MWPotential2014), making use of stars with available metallicities,
radial velocities, and proper motions from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12. Adopting the
St$\ddot{a}$ckel potential, we find that the shape of the metallicity distribution function (MDF)
and the distribution of orbital rotation abruptly change at $Z_{\rm max}$ = 15 kpc and $r_{\rm max}$
= 30 kpc (where $Z_{\rm max}$ and $r_{\rm max}$ are the maximum distances reached by a stellar orbit
from the Galactic plane and from the Galactic center, respectively), indicating that the transition
from dominance by the inner-halo stellar population to the outer-halo population occurs at those
distances. Stars with $Z_{\rm max}$ $>$ 15 kpc show an average retrograde motion of $V_{\rm \phi}$
= $-$60 km s$^{-1}$, while stars with $r_{\rm max}$ $>$ 30 kpc exhibit an even larger retrograde value,
$V_{\rm \phi}$ = $-$150 km s$^{-1}$. This retrograde signal is also confirmed using the sample of
stars with radial velocities obtained by $Gaia$ Data Release 2, assuming the St$\ddot{a}$ckel
potential. In comparison, when using the shallower Galpy potential, a noticeable change in the
MDF occurs only at $Z_{\rm max}$ = 25 kpc, and a much less extreme retrograde motion is derived. This
difference arises because stars with highly retrograde motions in the St$\ddot{a}$ckel potential
are unbound in the shallower Galpy potential, and stars with lower rotation velocities reach larger
$Z_{\rm max}$ and $r_{\rm max}$. The different kinematic characteristics derived from the two
potentials suggest that the nature of the adopted Galactic potential can strongly influence interpretation
of the properties of the Galactic halo.
