Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and photoevaporative winds are thought to play an important role in
the evolution and dispersal of planet-forming disks. We report the first high-resolution ($\Delta
v\sim$6\kms) analysis of [S II] $\lambda$4068, [O I] $\lambda$5577, and [O I] $\lambda$6300 lines
from a sample of 48 T Tauri stars. Following Simon et al. (2016), we decompose them into three kinematic
components: a high-velocity component (HVC) associated with jets, and a low-velocity narrow (LVC-NC)
and broad (LVC-BC) components. We confirm previous findings that many LVCs are blueshifted by more
than 1.5 kms$^{-1}$ thus most likely trace a slow disk wind. We further show that the profiles of individual
components are similar in the three lines. We find that most LVC-BC and NC line ratios are explained
by thermally excited gas with temperatures between 5,000$-$10,000 K and electron densities $\sim10^{7}-10^{8}$
cm$^{-3}$. The HVC ratios are better reproduced by shock models with a pre-shock H number density
of $\sim10^{6}-10^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$. Using these physical properties, we estimate $\dot{M}_{\rm
wind}/\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$ for the LVC and $\dot{M}_{\rm jet}/\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$ for the HVC. In
agreement with previous work, the mass carried out in jets is modest compared to the accretion rate.
With the likely assumption that the NC wind height is larger than the BC, the LVC-BC $\dot{M}_{\rm
wind}/\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$ is found to be higher than the LVC-NC. These results suggest that most
of the mass loss occurs close to the central star, within a few au, through an MHD driven wind. Depending
on the wind height, MHD winds might play a major role in the evolution of the disk mass.
