Chemistry plays a key role in many astrophysical situations, and therefore needs to be included
in astrophysical simulations modelling such environments. In particular, the chemical evolution
regulates the cooling, and the thermal properties of the gas, which are relevant during gravitational
collapse, the evolution of disks and the fragmentation process. At the same time, the chemistry
of the gas also determines the observational appearance, in particular with respect to the emission
through atomic, ionic or molecular lines. In order to simplify the usage of chemical networks in
large numerical simulations, we present the chemistry package KROME, consisting of a Python pre-processor
which generates a subroutine for the solution of chemical networks which can be embedded in any numerical
code. For the solution of the rate equations, we make use of the high-order solver DLSODES, which
was shown to be both accurate and efficient for sparse networks, which are typical in astrophysical
applications. KROME also provides a large set of physical processes connected to chemistry, including
photochemistry, cooling, heating, dust treatment, and reverse kinetics. The package presented
here already contains a network for primordial chemistry, a small metal network appropriate for
the modelling of low metallicities environments, a detailed network for the modelling of molecular
clouds, a network for planetary atmospheres, as well as a framework for the modelling of the dust
grain population. In this paper, we present an extended test suite ranging from one-zone and 1D-models
to first applications including cosmological simulations with Enzo and RAMSES and 3D collapse
simulations with the FLASH code. The package presented here is publicly available at this http URL
