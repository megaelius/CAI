According to the current standard model of Cosmology, matter in the Universe arranges itself along
a network of filamentary structure. These filaments connect the main nodes of this so-called 'Cosmic
Web', which are clusters of galaxies. Although its large-scale distribution is clearly characterized
by numerical simulations, constraining the dark matter content of the cosmic web in reality turns
out to be difficult. The natural method of choice is gravitational lensing. However, the direct
detection and mapping of the elusive filament signal is challenging and in this work we present two
methods,specifically tailored to achieve this task. A linear matched filter aims at the detection
of the smooth mass component of filaments and is optimized to perform a shear decomposition that
follows the anisotropic component of the lensing signal. Filaments clearly inherit this property
due to their morphology. At the same time, the contamination arising from the central massive cluster
is controlled in a natural way. The filament 1 {\sigma} detection is of about {\kappa} ~ 0.01-0.005
according to the filter's template width and length, enabling the detection of structures out of
reach with other approaches. The second, complementary method seeks to detect the clumpy component
of filaments. The detection is determined by the number density of sub-clump identifications in
an area enclosing the potential filament, as it was found within the observed field with the filter
approach. We test both methods against Mock observations based on realistic N-Body simulations
of filamentary structure and prove the feasibility of detecting filaments with ground-based data.
