We report NuSTAR and Chandra observations of two X-ray transients, SWIFT J174540.7$-$290015 (T15)
and SWIFT J174540.2$-$290037 (T37), which were discovered by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory
in 2016 within $r\sim1$ pc of Sgr A*. NuSTAR detected bright X-ray outbursts from T15 and T37, likely
in the soft and hard states, with 3-79~keV luminosities of $8\times10^{36}$ and $3\times10^{37}$
erg/s, respectively. No X-ray outbursts have previously been detected from the two transients
and our Chandra ACIS analysis puts an upper limit of $L_X \lesssim 2 \times10^{31}$ erg/s on their
quiescent 2-8 keV luminosities. No pulsations, significant QPOs, or type I X-ray bursts were detected
in the NuSTAR data. While T15 exhibited no significant red noise, the T37 power density spectra are
well characterized by three Lorentzian components. The declining variability of T37 above $\nu
\sim 10$ Hz is typical of black hole (BH) transients in the hard state. NuSTAR spectra of both transients
exhibit a thermal disk blackbody, X-ray reflection with broadened Fe atomic features, and a continuum
component well described by Comptonization models. Their X-ray reflection spectra are most consistent
with high BH spin ($a_{*} \gtrsim 0.9$) and large disk density ($n_e\sim10^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$). Based
on the best-fit ionization parameters and disk densities, we found that X-ray reflection occurred
near the inner disk radius, which was derived from the relativistic broadening and thermal disk
component. These X-ray characteristics suggest the outbursting BH-LMXB scenario for both transients
and yield the first BH spin measurements from X-ray transients in the central 100 pc region.
