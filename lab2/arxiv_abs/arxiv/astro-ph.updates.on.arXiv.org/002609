Discrepancies between the observed and model-predicted radio flux ratios are seen in a number of
quadruply-lensed quasars. The most favored interpretation of these anomalies is that CDM substructures
present in lensing galaxies perturb the lens potentials and alter image magnifications and thus
flux ratios. So far no consensus has emerged regarding whether or not the predicted CDM substructure
abundance fully accounts for the lensing flux anomaly observations. Accurate modeling relies
on a realistic lens sample in terms of both the lens environment and internal structures and substructures.
In this paper we construct samples of generalised and specific lens potentials, to which we add (rescaled)
subhalo populations from the galaxy-scale Aquarius and the cluster-scale Phoenix simulation
suites. We further investigate the lensing effects from subhalos of masses several orders of magnitude
below the simulation resolution limit. The resulting flux ratio distributions are compared to
the currently best available sample of radio lenses. The observed anomalies in B0128+437, B1608+656
and B1933+503 are more likely to be caused by propagation effects or oversimplified lens modeling,
signs of which are already seen in the data. Among the quadruple systems that have closely located
image triplets/pairs, the anomalous flux ratios of MG0414+0534 can be reproduced by adding CDM
subhalos to its macroscopic lens potential, with a probability of 5%-20%; for B0712+472, B1422+231,
B1555+375 and B2045+265, these probabilities are only of a few percent. We hence find that CDM substructures
are unlikely to be the whole reason for radio flux anomalies. We discuss other possible effects that
might also be at work.
