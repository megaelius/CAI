In the solar atmosphere, the acoustic cutoff frequency is a local quantity which depends on the atmospheric
height. It separates the low-frequency evanescent waves from the high-frequency propagating
waves. We measure the cutoff frequency of slow magnetoacoustic waves at various heights of a sunspot
umbra and compare the results with the estimations from several analytical formulae. We analyzed
the oscillations in the umbra of a sunspot belonging to active region NOAA 12662 observed in the 10830
\AA\ spectral region with the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph and in the Fe I 5435 \AA\ line with the
GREGOR Fabry-P\'erot Interferometer. Both instrumets are attached to the GREGOR telescope at
the Observatorio del Teide, Tenerife, Spain. We have computed the phase and amplification spectra
between the velocity measured from different pairs of lines that sample various heights of the solar
atmosphere. The cutoff frequency and its height variation have been estimated from the inspection
of the spectra. At the deep umbral photosphere the cutoff frequency is around 5 mHz and it increases
to 6 mHz at higher photospheric layers. At the chromosphere the cutoff is $\sim 3.1$ mHz. The comparison
of the observationally determined cutoff with the theoretically predicted values reveals an agreement
in the general trend and a reasonable match at the chromosphere, but also significant quantitative
differences at the photosphere. Our analyses show strong evidence of the variation of the cutoff
frequency with height in a sunspot umbra, which is not fully accounted for by current analytical
estimations. This result has implications for our understanding of wave propagation, the seismology
of active regions, and the evaluation of heating mechanisms based on compressible waves.
