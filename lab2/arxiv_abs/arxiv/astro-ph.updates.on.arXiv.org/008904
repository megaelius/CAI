We present a reformulation of axion modified electrodynamics with all modifications redefined
within the constitutive relations between the D,H,B and E fields. This allows the interpretation
of the axion induced background bound charge, polarization current and background polarization
and magnetization satisfying the charge-current continuity equation. This representation is
of similar form to photon sector odd-parity Lorentz invariance violating background fields. We
show that when a DC B-field is applied an oscillating background polarization is induced at a frequency
equivalent to the axion mass. In contrast, when DC E-field is applied, an oscillating background
magnetization is induced at a frequency equivalent to the axion mass. We show that these terms are
equivalent to impressed source terms, analogous to the way that voltage and current sources are
impressed into Maxwell's equations in circuit and antenna theory. The impressed source terms represent
the conversion of external energy into electromagnetic energy, and in the case of axion modified
electrodynamics this is due to the inverse Primakoff effect converting energy from axions into
photons. The axion induced oscillating polarization under a DC magnetic field is analogous to a
permanent polarised electret oscillating at the axion Compton frequency, which sources an electromotive
force from an effective impressed magnetic current source. In particular, it is shown that the impressed
electrical DC current that drives the solenoidal magnetic DC field of an electromagnet, induces
an impressed magnetic current parallel to the DC electrical current, oscillating at the Compton
frequency of the axion. We show that the magnetic current drives a voltage source through an electric
vector potential and also defines the boundary condition of the oscillating axion induced polarization
inside and outside the electromagnet.
