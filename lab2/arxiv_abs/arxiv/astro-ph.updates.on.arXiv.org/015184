The NASA $Kepler$ mission obtained long-term high-quality photometric observations for a large
number of stars in its original field of view from 2009 to 2013. In order to provide reliable stellar
parameters in a homogeneous way, the LAMOST telescope began to carry out low-resolution spectroscopic
observations for as many stars as possible in the $Kepler$ field in 2012. By September 2018, 238,386
low-resolution spectra with SNR$_g \geq 6$ had been collected for 155,623 stars in the $Kepler$
field, enabling the determination of atmospheric parameters and radial velocities, as well as
spectral classification of the target stars. This information has been used by astronomers to carry
out research in various fields, including stellar pulsations and asteroseismology, exoplanets,
stellar magnetic activity and flares, peculiar stars and the Milky Way, binary stars, etc. We summarize
the research progress in these fields where the usage of data from the LAMOST-$Kepler$ (LK) project
has played a role. In addition, time-domain medium-resolution spectroscopic observations have
been carried out for about 12,000 stars in four central plates of the $Kepler$ field since 2018. The
currently available results show that the LAMOST-$Kepler$ medium resolution (LK-MRS) observations
provide qualified data suitable for research in additional science projects including binaries,
high-amplitude pulsating stars, etc. As LAMOST is continuing to collect both low- and medium-resolution
spectra of stars in the $Kepler$ field, we expect more data to be released continuously and new scientific
results to appear based on the LK project data.
