Lensing of the CMB is now a well-developed probe of large-scale clustering over a broad range of redshifts.
By exploiting the non-Gaussian imprints of lensing in the polarization of the CMB, the CORE mission
can produce a clean map of the lensing deflections over nearly the full-sky. The number of high-S/N
modes in this map will exceed current CMB lensing maps by a factor of 40, and the measurement will be
sample-variance limited on all scales where linear theory is valid. Here, we summarise this mission
product and discuss the science that it will enable. For example, the summed mass of neutrinos will
be determined to an accuracy of 17 meV combining CORE lensing and CMB two-point information with
contemporaneous BAO measurements, three times smaller than the minimum total mass allowed by neutrino
oscillations. In the search for B-mode polarization from primordial gravitational waves with
CORE, lens-induced B-modes will dominate over instrument noise, limiting constraints on the gravitational
wave power spectrum amplitude. With lensing reconstructed by CORE, one can "delens" the observed
polarization internally, reducing the lensing B-mode power by 60%. This improves to 70% by combining
lensing and CIB measurements from CORE, reducing the error on the gravitational wave amplitude
by 2.5 compared to no delensing (in the null hypothesis). Lensing measurements from CORE will allow
calibration of the halo masses of the 40000 galaxy clusters that it will find, with constraints dominated
by the clean polarization-based estimators. CORE can accurately remove Galactic emission from
CMB maps with its 19 frequency channels. We present initial findings that show that residual Galactic
foreground contamination will not be a significant source of bias for lensing power spectrum measurements
with CORE. [abridged]
