We present the clustering properties of low-$z$ $(z\leq1.4)$ galaxies selected by the Hyper Suprime-Cam
Subaru Strategic Program Wide layer over $145$ deg$^{2}$. The wide-field and multi-wavelength
observation yields $5,064,770$ galaxies at $0.3\leq z\leq1.4$ with photometric redshifts and
physical properties. This enables the accurate measurement of angular correlation functions
and subsequent halo occupation distribution (HOD) analysis allows the connection between baryonic
properties and dark halo properties. The fraction of less-massive satellite galaxies at $z\lesssim1$
is found to be almost constant at $\sim20\%$, but it gradually decreases beyond $M_{\star} \sim
10^{10.4}h^{-2}M_{\odot}$. However, the abundance of satellite galaxies at $z>1$ is quite small
even for less-massive galaxies due to the rarity of massive centrals at high-$z$. This decreasing
trend is connected to the small satellite fraction of Lyman break galaxies at $z>3$. The stellar-to-halo
mass ratios at $0.3\leq z\leq1.4$ are almost consistent with the predictions obtained using the
latest empirical model; however, we identify small excesses from the theoretical model at the massive
end. The pivot halo mass is found to be unchanged at $10^{11.9-12.1}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ at $0.3\leq
z\leq1.4$, and we systematically show that $10^{12}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ is a universal pivot halo
mass up to $z\sim5$ that is derived using only the clustering/HOD analyses. Nevertheless, halo
masses with peaked instantaneous baryon conversion efficiencies are much smaller than the pivot
halo mass regardless of a redshift, and the most efficient stellar-mass assembly is thought to be
in progress in $10^{11.0-11.5}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ dark haloes.
