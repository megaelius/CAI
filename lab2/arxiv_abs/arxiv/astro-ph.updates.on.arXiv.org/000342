We investigate the prospects for constraining alternative theories of gravity with a typical near-term
low-budget 21 cm intensity mapping experiment. We derive the 21 cm brightness temperature perturbation
consistently in linear theory including all line-of-sight and relativistic effects. We uncover
new terms that are a small correction on large scales, analogous to those recently found in the context
of galaxy surveys. We then perform a Fisher matrix analysis of the B_0 parametrization of f(R) gravity,
where B_0 is proportional to the square of Compton wavelength of the scalaron. We find that our 21
cm survey, in combination with CMB information from Planck, will be able to place a 95% upper limit
of 7 x 10^{-5} on B_0 in flat models with a LCDM expansion history, improving on current cosmological
constraints by several orders of magnitude. We argue that this constraint is limited by our ability
to model the mildly non-linear regime of structure formation in modified gravity. We also perform
a model-independent principal component analysis on the free functions introduced into the field
equations by modified gravity, mu and Sigma. We find that 20--30 modes of the free functions will
be `well-constrained' by our combination of observables, the lower and upper limits dependent
on the criteria used to define the `goodness' of the constraint. These constraints are found to be
robust to uncertainties in the time-dependence of the bias. Our analysis reveals that our observables
are sensitive primarily to temporal variations in Sigma and scale variations in mu. We argue that
the inclusion of 21 cm intensity maps will significantly improve constraints on any cosmological
deviations from General Relativity in large-scale structure in a very cost-effective manner.
