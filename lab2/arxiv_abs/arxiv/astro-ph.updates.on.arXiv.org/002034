Context: More than 50 exoplanets have been found around giant stars, revealing different properties
when compared to planets orbiting solar-type stars. In particular, they are Super-Jupiters and
are not found orbiting interior to $\sim$ 0.5 AU. Aims: We are conducting a radial velocity study
of a sample of 166 giant stars aimed at studying the population of close-in planets orbiting giant
stars and how their orbital and physical properties are influenced by the post-MS evolution of the
host star. Methods: We have collected multi epochs spectra for all of the targets in our sample. We
have computed precision radial velocities from FECH/CHIRON and FEROS spectra, using the I$_2$
cell technique and the simultaneous calibration method, respectively. Results: We present the
discovery of a massive planet around the giant star HIP105854. The best Keplerian fit to the data
leads to an orbital distance of 0.81 $\pm$ 0.03 AU, an eccentricity of 0.02 $\pm$ 0.03 and a projected
mass of 8.2 $\pm$ 0.2 \mjup. With the addition of this new planet discovery, we performed a detailed
analysis of the orbital properties and mass distribution of the planets orbiting giant stars. We
show that there is an overabundance of planets around giant stars with $a \sim$ 0.5-0.9 AU, which
might be attributed to tidal decay. Additionally, these planets are significantly more massive
than those around MS and subgiant stars, suggesting that they grow via accretion either from the
stellar wind or by mass transfer from the host star. Finally, we show that planets around evolved
stars have lower orbital eccentricities than those orbiting solar-type stars, which suggests
that they are either formed in different conditions or that their orbits are efficiently circularized
by interactions with the host star.
