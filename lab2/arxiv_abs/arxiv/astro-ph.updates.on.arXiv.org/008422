Convective motions in the solar atmosphere cause spectral lines to become asymmetric and shifted
in wavelength. For photospheric lines, this differential Doppler shift varies from the solar disk
center to the limb. Precise and comprehensive observations of the convective blueshift and its
center-to-limb variation improve our understanding of the atmospheric hydrodynamics and ensuing
line formation, and provide the basis to refine 3D models of the solar atmosphere. We performed systematical
spectroscopic measurements of the convective blueshift of the quiet Sun with the Laser Absolute
Reference Spectrograph (LARS) at the German Vacuum Tower Telescope. The spatial scanning of the
solar disk covered four radial (meridional and equatorial) axes. The high-resolution spectra
of 26 photospheric to chromospheric lines in the visible range were calibrated with a laser frequency
comb to absolute wavelengths at the 1m/s accuracy. Applying ephemeris and reference corrections,
the bisector analysis provided line asymmetries and Doppler shifts with an uncertainty of only
few m/s. To allow for a comparison with other observations, we convolved the results to lower spectral
resolutions. Typically, a blueshifted "C"-shaped curve at disk center transforms into a less blueshifted
"\"-shape toward the solar limb. The comparison of all lines reveals the systematic dependence
of the convective blueshift on the line depth. Synthetic models yield considerable deviations
from the observed center-to-limb variation. The obtained Doppler shifts of the quiet Sun can serve
as an absolute reference for other observations, the relative calibration of Dopplergrams, and
the necessary refinement of atmospheric models. Based on this, the development of high-precision
models of stellar surface convection will advance the detection of (potentially habitable) exoplanets
by radial velocity measurements.
