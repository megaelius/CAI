We present radio continuum maps of 12 nearby ($D\leq 27~\rm Mpc$), edge-on ($i\geq 76^{\circ}$),
late-type spiral galaxies mostly at $1.4$ and 5 GHz, observed with the Australia Telescope Compact
Array, Very Large Array, Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, Effelsberg 100-m and Parkes 64-m
telescopes. All galaxies show clear evidence of radio haloes, including the first detection in
the Magellanic-type galaxy NGC 55. In 11 galaxies, we find a thin and a thick disc that can be better
fitted by exponential rather than Gaussian functions. We fit our SPINNAKER (SPectral INdex Numerical
Analysis of K(c)osmic-ray Electron Radio-emission) 1D cosmic-ray transport models to the vertical
model profiles of the non-thermal intensity and to the non-thermal radio spectral index in the halo.
We simultaneously fit for the advection speed (or diffusion coefficient) and magnetic field scale
height. In the thick disc, the magnetic field scale heights range from 2 to 8 kpc with an average across
the sample of $3.0\pm 1.7~\rm kpc$; they show no correlation with either star-formation rate (SFR),
SFR surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) or rotation speed ($V_{\rm rot}$). The advection speeds
range from 100 to $700~\rm km\,s^{-1}$ and display correlations of $V\propto \rm SFR^{0.36\pm
0.06}$ and $V\propto \Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{0.39\pm 0.09}$; they agree remarkably well with the escape
velocities ($0.5\leq V/V_{\rm esc}\leq 2$), which can be explained by cosmic-ray driven winds.
Radio haloes show the presence of disc winds in galaxies with $\Sigma_{\rm SFR} > 10^{-3}~\rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}\,kpc^{-2}$
that extend over several kpc and are driven by processes related to the distributed star formation
in the disc.
