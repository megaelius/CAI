Chemical compositions of exoplanets can provide key insights into their physical processes, and
formation and evolutionary histories. Atmospheric spectroscopy provides a direct avenue to probe
exoplanetary compositions. However, whether obtained in transit or thermal emission, spectroscopic
observations probe limited pressure windows of planetary atmospheres and are directly sensitive
to only a limited set of spectroscopically active species. It is therefore critical to have chemical
models that can relate retrieved atmospheric compositions to an atmosphere's bulk physical and
chemical state. To this end we present LEVI, a new chemical kinetics code for modelling exoplanetary
atmospheres. LEVI calculates the gas phase hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen chemistry in
planetary atmospheres. Here we focus on hot gas giants. Applying LEVI, we investigate how variations
in bulk C/O and N/O affects the observable atmospheric chemistry in hot Jupiters. For typical hot
Jupiters we demonstrate the strong sensitivity of molecular detections to the atmospheric C/O.
Molecular detections are conversely less sensitive to the atmospheric N/O ratio, although highly
super-solar N/O can decrease the C/O required for HCN and NH3 detection. Using a new P-T profile for
HD 209458b without a thermal inversion, we evaluate recently reported detection's of CO, H2O and
HCN in its day-side atmosphere. We find that our models are consistent with the detected species,
albeit with a narrow compositional window around C/O $\sim$ 1. A C/O $\gtrsim$ 0.9 (1.6 times solar)
was required to meet the minimum reported value for HCN, while a C/O $\lesssim$ 1 (1.8 times solar)
was required to fit the nominal H2O abundance.
