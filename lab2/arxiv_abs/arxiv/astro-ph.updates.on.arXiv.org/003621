Horseshoe-shaped brightness asymmetries of several transitional discs are thought to be caused
by large-scale vortices. Anticyclonic vortices are efficiently collect dust particles, therefore
they can play a major role in planet formation. Former studies suggest that the disc self-gravity
weakens vortices formed at the edge of the gap opened by a massive planet in discs whose masses are
in the range of 0.01<=M_disc/M_*<=0.1. Here we present an investigation on the long-term evolution
of the large-scale vortices formed at the viscosity transition of the discs' dead zone outer edge
by means of two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations taking disc self-gravity into account.
We perform a numerical study of low mass, 0.001<=M_disc/M_*<=0.01, discs, for which cases disc
self-gravity was previously neglected. The large-scale vortices are found to be stretched due
to disc self-gravity even for low-mass discs with M_disc/M_*>=0.005 where initially the Toomre
Q-parameter was <=50 at the vortex distance. As a result of stretching, the vortex aspect ratio increases
and a weaker azimuthal density contrast develops. The strength of the vortex stretching is proportional
to the disc mass. The vortex stretching can be explained by a combined action of a non-vanishing gravitational
torque caused by the vortex, and the Keplerian shear of the disc. Self-gravitating vortices are
subject to significantly faster decay than non-self-gravitating ones. We found that vortices
developed at sharp viscosity transitions of self-gravitating discs can be described by a GNG model
as long as the disc viscosity is low, i.e. alpha_dz<=10^-5.
