We have used the Submillimeter Array at 860$\,\mu$m to observe the brightest SCUBA-2 sources in
4$\,$deg$^{2}$ of the Cosmology Legacy Survey. We have targeted 75 of the brightest single-dish
SCUBA-2 850$\,\mu$m sources down to $S_{850}\,{\approx}\,8\,$mJy, achieving an average synthesized
beam of 2.4$^{\prime\prime}$ and an average rms of $\sigma_{860}\,{=}\,1.5\,$mJy in our primary
beam-corrected maps. We searched our maps for $4\sigma$ peaks, corresponding to $S_{860}\,{\gtrsim}\,6\,$mJy
sources, and detected 59 single galaxies and three pairs of galaxies. We include in our study 28 archival
observations, bringing our sample size to 103 bright single-dish submillimetre sources with interferometric
follow-up. We compute the cumulative and differential number counts of our sample, finding them
to overlap with previous single-dish survey number counts within the uncertainties, although
our cumulative number count is systematically lower than the parent SCUBA-2 cumulative number
count by $24\,{\pm}\,6$ per cent between 11 and 15$\,$mJy. We estimate the probability that a ${\gtrsim}\,10\,$mJy
single-dish submillimetre source resolves into two or more galaxies with similar flux densities,
causing a significant change in the number counts, to be about 15 per cent. Assuming the remaining
85 per cent of the targets are ultra-luminous starburst galaxies between $z\,{=}\,2$-3, we find
a likely volume density of ${\gtrsim}\,400\,$M$_{\odot}\,$yr$^{-1}$ sources to be ${\sim}\,3^{+0.7}_{-0.6}\,{\times}\,10^{-7}\,$Mpc$^{-3}$.
We show that the descendants of these galaxies could be ${\gtrsim}\,4\,{\times}\,10^{11}\,$M$_{\odot}$
local quiescent galaxies, and that about 10 per cent of their total stellar mass would have formed
during these short bursts of star-formation.
