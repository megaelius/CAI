Dwarf galaxies found in isolation in the Local Group (LG) are unlikely to have interacted with the
large LG spirals, and therefore environmental effects should not be the main drivers of their evolution.
We aim to provide insight into the internal mechanisms shaping LG dwarf galaxies by increasing our
knowledge of the internal properties of isolated systems. We focus on the evolved stellar component
of the Aquarius dwarf, whose kinematic and metallicity properties have only recently started to
be explored. We have obtained spectroscopic data in the the near-infrared CaII triplet lines region
with FORS2 at the Very Large Telescope for 53 red giant branch (RGB) stars, to derive line-of-sight
velocities and [Fe/H] of the individual RGB stars. We have derived a systemic velocity of $-142.2^{+1.8}_{-1.8}$
km s$^{-1}$, in agreement with previous measurements from both the HI gas and stars. The internal
kinematics of Aquarius appears to be best modelled by a combination of random motions (l.o.s. velocity
dispersion of $10.3^{+1.6}_{-1.3}$ km s$^{-1}$) and linear rotation (with a gradient $-5.0^{+1.6}_{-1.9}$
km s$^{-1}$ arcmin$^{-1}$) along a P.A.=$139_{-27}^{+17}$ deg, consistent with the optical projected
major axis. This rotation signal is significantly misaligned or even counter-rotating to that
derived from the HI gas. We also find the tentative presence of a mild negative metallicity gradient
and indications that the metal-rich stars have a colder velocity dispersion than the metal-poor
ones. This work represents a significant improvement with respect to previous measurements of
the RGB stars of Aquarius, as it doubles the number of member stars studied in the literature. We speculate
that the misaligned rotation between the HI gas and evolved stellar component might have been the
result of recent accretion of HI gas or re-accretion after gas-loss due to internal stellar feedback.
