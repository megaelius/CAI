We present observations of main-belt comet 358P/PANSTARRS (P/2012 T1) obtained using the Gemini
South telescope from 2017 July to 2017 December, as the object approached perihelion for the first
time since its discovery. We find best-fit IAU phase function parameters of H_R=19.5+/-0.2 mag
and G_R=-0.22+/-0.13 for the nucleus, corresponding to an effective radius of r_N=0.32+/-0.03
km (assuming an albedo of p_R=0.05). The object appears significantly brighter (by >1 mag) than
expected starting in 2017 November, while a faint dust tail oriented approximately in the antisolar
direction is also observed on 2017 December 18. We conclude that 358P has become active again for
the first time since its previously observed active period in 2012-2013. These observations make
358P the seventh main-belt comet candidate confirmed to exhibit recurrent activity near perihelion
with intervening inactivity away from perihelion, strongly indicating that its activity is sublimation-driven.
Fitting a linear function to the ejected dust masses inferred for 358P in 2017 when it is apparently
active, we find an average net dust production rate of 2.0+/-0.6 kg/s (assuming a mean effective
particle radius of 1 mm) and an estimated activity start date of 2017 November 8+/-4 when the object
was at a true anomaly of 316+/-1 deg and a heliocentric distance of R=2.54 AU. Insufficient data is
currently available to ascertain whether activity strength has changed between the object's 2012-2013
and 2017 active periods. Further observations are therefore highly encouraged during the object's
upcoming observing window (2018 August through 2019 May).
