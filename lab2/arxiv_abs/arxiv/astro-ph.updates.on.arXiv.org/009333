We present spatially-resolved stellar kinematics of the well-studied ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG)
Dragonfly 44, as determined from 25.3 hrs of observations with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager. The luminosity-weighted
dispersion within the half-light radius is $\sigma_{1/2}=33^{+3}_{-3}$ km/s. There is no evidence
for rotation, with $V/\sigma<0.12$ (90% confidence) along the major axis, in apparent conflict
with models where UDGs are the high-spin tail of the normal dwarf galaxy distribution. The spatially-averaged
line profile is more peaked than a Gaussian, with Gauss-Hermite coefficient $h_4=0.13\pm 0.05$.
The mass-to-light ratio within the effective radius is $M/L=26^{+7}_{-6}$, similar to other UDGs
and higher by a factor of six than normal galaxies of the same luminosity. This difference between
UDGs and other galaxies is, however, sensitive to the aperture that is used, and is much reduced when
the $M/L$ ratios are measured within a fixed radius of 10 kpc. Dragonfly 44 has a rising velocity dispersion
profile, from $\sigma=26^{+4}_{-4}$ km/s at R=0.2 kpc to $\sigma=41^{+8}_{-8}$ km/s at R=5.1
kpc. The profile can only be fit with a cuspy NFW profile if the orbital distribution has strong tangential
anisotropy, with $\beta=-0.8^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$. An alternative explanation is that the dark matter
profile has a core: a Di Cintio et al. (2014) density profile with a mass-dependent core provides
a very good fit to the kinematics for a halo mass of $\log (M_{200}/{\rm M}_{\odot})=11.2^{+0.6}_{-0.6}$
and $\beta=-0.1^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$, i.e., isotropic orbits. This model predicts a slight positive
kurtosis, in qualitative agreement with the measured $h_4$ parameter. UDGs such as Dragonfly 44
are dark matter dominated even in their centers, and can constrain the properties of dark matter
in a regime where baryons usually dominate the kinematics: small spatial scales in massive halos.
