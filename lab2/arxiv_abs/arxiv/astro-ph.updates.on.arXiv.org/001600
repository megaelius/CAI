In 1976 S. Hawking claimed that "Because part of the information about the state of the system is lost
down the hole, the final situation is represented by a density matrix rather than a pure quantum state"
(Verbatim from ref. 2.) This was the starting point of the popular "black hole (BH) information paradox".
On the other hand, during one of his famous quantum field theory lectures at Harvard, S. Coleman claimed
that "The career of a young theoretical physicist consists of treating the harmonic oscillator
in ever-increasing levels of abstraction." One of the highest levels of abstraction concerning
the harmonic oscillator in Nature is surely represented by BH quasi-normal modes (QNMs), which
are a countable set of damped oscillations representing the BH's reaction to perturbations. In
a series of papers, together with collaborators, I naturally interpreted BH QNMs in terms of quantum
levels. Here I explicitly write down a time dependent Schr\"odinger equation for the system composed
by Hawking radiation and BH QNMs. The physical state and the correspondent wave-function are written
in terms of an unitary evolution matrix instead of a density matrix. Thus, the final state results
to be a pure quantum state instead of mixed one. Hence, Hawking's claim is falsified by an application
of Coleman's claim. Information comes out in BH evaporation in terms of pure states in an unitary
time dependent evolution. The assumption by 't Hooft that Schr\"oedinger equations can be used
universally for all dynamics in the universe is in turn confirmed, further endorsing the conclusion
that BH evaporation must be information preserving.
