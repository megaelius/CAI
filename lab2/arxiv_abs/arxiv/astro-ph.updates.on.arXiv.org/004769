The Nobel Prize winning confirmation in 1998 of the accelerated expansion of our Universe put into
sharp focus the need of a consistent theoretical model to explain the origin of this acceleration.
As a result over the past two decades there has been a huge theoretical and observational effort into
improving our understanding of the Universe. The cosmological equations describing the dynamics
of a homogeneous and isotropic Universe are systems of ordinary differential equations, and one
of the most elegant ways these can be investigated is by casting them into the form of dynamical systems.
This allows the use of powerful analytical and numerical methods to gain a quantitative understanding
of the cosmological dynamics derived by the models under study. In this review we apply these techniques
to cosmology. We begin with a brief introduction to dynamical systems, fixed points, linear stability
theory, Lyapunov stability, centre manifold theory and more advanced topics relating to the global
structure of the solutions. Using this machinery we then analyse a large number of cosmological
models and show how the stability conditions allow them to be tightly constrained and even ruled
out on purely theoretical grounds. We are also able to identify those models which deserve further
in depth investigation through comparison with observational data. This review is a comprehensive
and detailed study of dynamical systems applications to cosmological models focusing on the late-time
behaviour of our Universe, and in particular on its accelerated expansion. In self contained sections
we present a large number of models ranging from canonical and non-canonical scalar fields, interacting
models and non-scalar field models through to modified gravity scenarios. Selected models are
discussed in details and interpreted in the context of late-time cosmology.
