Extracting the multiphase structure of the neutral interstellar medium (ISM) is key to understand
the star formation in galaxies. The radiative condensation of the diffuse warm neutral medium producing
a thermally unstable lukewarm medium and a dense cold medium is closely related to the initial step
which leads the HI-to-H2 transition and the formation of molecular clouds. Up to now the mapping
of these phases out of 21 cm emission hyper-spectral cubes has remained elusive mostly due to the
velocity blending of individual cold structures present on a given line of sight. To address this
problem, we developed a new Gaussian decomposition algorithm named ROHSA (Regularized Optimization
for Hyper-Spectral Analysis) based on a multi-resolution process from coarse to fine grid. ROHSA
uses a regularized non-linear least-square criterion to take into account simultaneously the
spatial coherence of the emission and the multiphase nature of the gas. In order to obtain a solution
with spatially smooth parameters, the optimization is performed on the whole data cube at once.
The performances of ROHSA were tested on a synthetic observation computed from numerical simulations
of thermally bi-stable turbulence. An application on a 21 cm observation of a high Galactic latitude
region from the GHIGLS survey is presented. The evaluation of ROHSA on synthetic 21 cm observations
shows that it is able to recover the multiphase nature of the HI and physically meaningful information
about the underlying three-dimensional fields (density, velocity and temperature). The application
on a real 21 cm observation of a high Galactic latitude field produces a picture of the multiphase
HI, with isolated, filamentary and narrow structures and wider, diffuse and space filling components.
The test-case field used here contains significant intermediate-velocity clouds that were well
mapped out by the algorithm.
