We present the discovery of CoRoT 223992193, a double-lined, detached eclipsing binary, comprising
two pre-main sequence M dwarfs, discovered by the CoRoT space mission during a 23-day observation
of the 3 Myr old NGC 2264 star-forming region. Using multi-epoch optical and near-IR follow-up spectroscopy
with FLAMES on the Very Large Telescope and ISIS on the William Herschel Telescope we obtain a full
orbital solution and derive the fundamental parameters of both stars by modelling the light curve
and radial velocity data. The orbit is circular and has a period of $3.8745745 \pm 0.0000014$ days.
The masses and radii of the two stars are $0.67 \pm 0.01$ and $0.495 \pm 0.007$ $M_{\odot}$ and $1.30
\pm 0.04$ and $1.11 ~^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$ $R_{\odot}$, respectively. This system is a useful test
of evolutionary models of young low-mass stars, as it lies in a region of parameter space where observational
constraints are scarce; comparison with these models indicates an apparent age of $\sim$3.5-6
Myr. The systemic velocity is within $1\sigma$ of the cluster value which, along with the presence
of lithium absorption, strongly indicates cluster membership. The CoRoT light curve also contains
large-amplitude, rapidly evolving out-of-eclipse variations, which are difficult to explain
using starspots alone. The system's spectral energy distribution reveals a mid-infrared excess,
which we model as thermal emission from a small amount of dust located in the inner cavity of a circumbinary
disk. In turn, this opens up the possibility that some of the out-of-eclipse variability could be
due to occultations of the central stars by material located at the inner edge or in the central cavity
of the circumbinary disk.
