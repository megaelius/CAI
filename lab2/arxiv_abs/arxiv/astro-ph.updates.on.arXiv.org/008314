We investigate how environment affects satellite galaxies using their location within the projected
phase-space of their host haloes from the Wang et al.'s group catalogue. Using the Yonsei Zoom in
Cluster Simulations, we derive zones of constant mean infall time T_inf in projected phase-space,
and catalogue in which zone each observed galaxy falls. Within each zone we compute the mean observed
galaxy properties including specific star formation rate, luminosity-weighted age, stellar
metallicity and [alpha/Fe] abundance ratio. By comparing galaxies in different zones, we inspect
how shifting the mean infall time from recent infallers (mean T_inf < 3 Gyr) to ancient infallers
(mean T_inf > 5 Gyr) impacts galaxy properties at fixed stellar and halo mass. Ancient infallers
are more quenched, and the impact of environmental quenching is visible down to low host masses (<
group masses). Meanwhile, the quenching of recent infallers is weakly dependent on host mass, indicating
they have yet to respond strongly to their current environment. [alpha/Fe] and especially metallicity
are less dependent on host mass, but show a dependence on mean T_inf. We discuss these results in the
context of longer exposure times for ancient infallers to environmental effects, which grow more
efficient in hosts with a deeper potential well and a denser intracluster medium. We also compare
our satellites with a control field sample, and find that even the most recent infallers (mean T_inf
< 2 Gyr) are more quenched than field galaxies, in particular for cluster mass hosts. This supports
the role of pre-processing and/or faster quenching in satellites.
