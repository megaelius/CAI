As current gravitational wave (GW) detectors increase in sensitivity, and particularly as new
instruments are being planned, there is the possibility that ground-based GW detectors will observe
GWs from highly eccentric neutron star binaries. We present the first detailed study of highly eccentric
BNS systems with full (3+1)D numerical relativity simulations using consistent initial conditions,
i.e., setups which are in agreement with the Einstein equations and with the equations of general
relativistic hydrodynamics in equilibrium. Overall, our simulations cover two different equations
of state (EOSs), two different spin configurations, and three to four different initial eccentricities
for each pairing of EOS and spin. We extract from the simulated waveforms the frequency of the f-mode
oscillations induced during close encounters before the merger of the two stars. The extracted
frequency is in good agreement with f-mode oscillations of individual stars for the irrotational
cases, which allows an independent measure of the supranuclear equation of state not accessible
for binaries on quasi-circular orbits. The energy stored in these f-mode oscillations can be as
large as $10^{-3}M_\odot \sim 10^{51}$ erg, even with a soft EOS. In order to estimate the stored
energy, we also examine the effects of mode mixing due to the stars' offset from the origin on the f-mode
contribution to the GW signal. While in general (eccentric) neutron star mergers produce bright
electromagnetic counterparts, we find that the luminosity decreases when the eccentricity becomes
too large, due to a decrease of the ejecta mass. Finally, the use of consistent initial configurations
also allows us to produce high-quality waveforms for different eccentricities which can be used
as a testbed for waveform model development of highly eccentric binary neutron star systems.
