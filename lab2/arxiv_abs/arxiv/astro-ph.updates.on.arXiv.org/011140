We report the analysis of additional multi-band photometry and spectroscopy, and new adaptive
optics (AO) imaging of the nearby planetary microlensing event, TCP J05074264+2447555 (hereafter
called Kojima-1), which was discovered toward the Galactic anticenter in 2017 (Nucita et al.).
We confirm the planetary nature of the light-curve anomaly around the peak, while find no additional
planetary feature in this event. We also confirm the presence of apparent blending flux and the absence
of significant parallax signal reported in the literature. The AO image reveals no contaminating
sources, making it most likely that the blending flux comes from the lens star. The measured multi-band
lens flux, combined with a constraint from the microlensing model, allows us to narrow down the previously-unresolved
mass and distance of the lens system. We find that the primary lens is a dwarf on the K/M boundary (0.581
\pm 0.033 M_sun) located at 505 \pm 47 pc and the companion (Kojima-1Lb) is a Neptune-mass planet
(20.0 \pm 2.0 M_earth) with a semi-major axis of 1.08 ^{+0.62}_{-0.18} au. This orbit is a few times
smaller than those of typical microlensing planets and is comparable to the snow line location at
young ages. We calculate that the a priori detection probability of Kojima-1Lb is only \sim 35%,
which may imply that Neptunes are common around the snow line as recently suggested by the transit
and radial-velocity techniques. The host star is the brightest among the microlensing planetary
systems (Ks = 13.7), offering a great opportunity to spectroscopically characterize this system
even with current facilities.
