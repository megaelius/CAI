The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) has now made continuous
in-situ meteorological measurements for several martian years at Gale crater, Mars. Of importance
in the search for liquid formation are REMS' measurements of ground temperature and in-air measurements
of temperature and relative humidity, which is with respect to ice. Such data can constrain the surface
and subsurface stability of brines. Here we use updated calibrations to REMS data and consistent
relative humidity comparisons (i.e., w.r.t. liquid vs w.r.t. ice) to investigate the potential
formation of surface and subsurface liquids throughout MSL's traverse. We specifically study
the potential for the deliquescence of calcium perchlorate. Our data analysis suggests that surface
brine formation is not favored within the first 1648 sols as there are only two times (sols 1232 and
1311) when humidity-temperature conditions were within error consistent with a liquid phase.
On the other hand, modeling of the subsurface environment would support brine production in the
shallow subsurface. Indeed, we find that the shallow subsurface for terrains with low thermal inertia
($\Gamma\lesssim 300$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$) may be occasionally favorable to brine
formation through deliquescence. Terrains with $\Gamma\lesssim175$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$
and albedos of $\gtrsim0.25$ are the most apt to subsurface brine formation. Should brines form,
they would occur around Ls 100$^{\circ}$. Their predicted properties would not meet the Special
nor Uncertain Region requirements, as such they would not be potential habitable environments
to life as we know it.
