We present the spin frequency and profile evolution of the radio pulsar J1119$-$6127 following
magnetar-like X-ray bursts from the system in 2016 July. Using data from the Parkes radio telescope,
we observe a smooth and fast spin-down process subsequent to the X-ray bursts resulting in a net change
in the pulsar rotational frequency of $\Delta\nu\approx-4\times10^{-4}$\,Hz. During the transition,
a net spin-down rate increase of $\Delta\dot\nu\approx-1\times10^{-10}$\,Hz\,s$^{-1}$ is
observed, followed by a return of $\dot{\nu}$ to its original value. In addition, the radio pulsations
disappeared after the X-ray bursts and reappeared about two weeks later with the flux density at
1.4\,GHz increased by a factor of five. The flux density then decreased and undershot the normal
flux density followed by a slow recovery back to normal. The pulsar's integrated profile underwent
dramatic and short-term changes in total intensity, polarization and position angle. Despite
the complex evolution, we observe correlations between the spin-down rate, pulse profile shape
and radio flux density. Strong single pulses have been detected after the X-ray bursts with their
energy distributions evolving with time. The peculiar but smooth spin frequency evolution of PSR~J1119$-$6127
accompanied by systematic pulse profile and flux density changes are most likely to be a result of
either reconfiguration of the surface magnetic fields or particle winds triggered by the X-ray
bursts. The recovery of spin-down rate and pulse profile to normal provides us the best case to study
the connection between high magnetic-field pulsars and magnetars.
