The role of massive stars is central to an understanding of galactic ecology. It is important to establish
the details of how massive stars provide radiative, chemical, and mechanical feedback in galaxies.
Central to these issues is an understanding of the evolution of massive stars, and the critical role
of mass loss via strongly structured winds and stellar binarity. Ultimately, massive stellar clusters
shape the structure and energetics of galaxies. We aim to conduct high-resolution, deep field mapping
at 21cm of the core of the massive Cygnus OB2 association and to characterise the properties of the
massive stars and colliding winds at this waveband. We used seven stations of the e-MERLIN radio
facility, with its upgraded bandwidth and enhanced sensitivity to conduct a 21cm census of Cygnus
OB2. Based on 42 hours of observations, seven overlapping pointings were employed over multiple
epochs during 2014 resulting in 1 sigma sensitivities down to ~21microJy and a resolution of ~180mas.
A total of 61 sources are detected at 21cm over a ~0.48deg x 0.48deg region centred on the heart of the
Cyg OB2 association. Of these 61 sources, 33 are detected for the first time. We detect a number of
previously identified sources including four massive stellar binary systems, two YSOs, and several
known X-ray and radio sources. We also detect the LBV candidate (possible binary system) and blue
hypergiant (BHG) star of Cyg OB2 #12. The 21cm observations secured in the COBRaS Legacy project
provide data to constrain conditions in the outer wind regions of massive stars; determine the non-thermal
properties of massive interacting binaries; examine evidence for transient sources, including
those associated with young stellar objects; and provide unidentified sources that merit follow-up
observations. The 21cm data are of lasting value and will serve in combination with other key surveys
of Cyg OB2.
