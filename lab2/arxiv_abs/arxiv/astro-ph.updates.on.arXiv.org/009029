Interstellar dust is an essential component of the interstellar medium (ISM) and plays critical
roles in astrophysics. Achieving an accurate model of interstellar dust is therefore of great importance.
Interstellar dust models are usually built based on observational constraints such as starlight
extinction and polarization, but dynamical constraints such as grain rotation are not considered.
In this paper, we show that a newly discovered effect by Hoang et al., so-called RAdiative Torque
Disruption (RATD), can act as an important dynamical constraint for dust models. Using this dynamical
constraint, we derive the maximum size of grains that survive in the ISM for different dust models,
including contact binary, composite, silicate-core, and amorphous carbon mantle, and compact
grain model for the different radiation fields. We find that the different dust models have different
maximum size due to their different tensile strengths, and the largest maximum size corresponds
to compact grains with the highest tensile strength. We show that the composite grain model cannot
be ruled out if constituent particles are very small with radius $a_{p}\le$ 25 nm, but large composite
grains would be destroyed if the particles are large with $a_{p}\ge 50$ nm. We suggest that grain
internal structures can be constrained with observations using the dynamical RATD constraint
for strong radiation fields such as supernova, nova, or star-forming regions. Finally, our obtained
results suggest that micron-sized grains perhaps have compact/core-mantle structures or have
composite structures but located in regions with slightly higher gas density and weaker radiation
intensity than the average ISM.
