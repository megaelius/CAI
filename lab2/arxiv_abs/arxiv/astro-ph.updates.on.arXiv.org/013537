The search for life on exoplanets is one of the grand scientific challenges of our time. The strategy
to date has been to find (e.g., through transit surveys like Kepler) Earth-like exoplanets in their
stars habitable zone, then use transmission spectroscopy to measure biosignature gases, especially
oxygen, in the planets atmospheres (e.g., using JWST, the James Webb Space Telescope). Already
there are more such planets than can be observed by JWST, and missions like the Transiting Exoplanet
Survey Satellite and others will find more. A better understanding of the geochemical cycles relevant
to biosignature gases is needed, to prioritize targets for costly follow-up observations and to
help design future missions. We define a Detectability Index to quantify the likelihood that a biosignature
gas could be assigned a biological vs. non-biological origin. We apply this index to the case of oxygen
gas, O2, on Earth-like planets with varying water contents. We demonstrate that on Earth-like exoplanets
with 0.2 weight percent (wt%) water (i.e., no exposed continents) a reduced flux of bioessential
phosphorus limits the export of photosynthetically produced atmospheric O2 to levels indistinguishable
from geophysical production by photolysis of water plus hydrogen escape. Higher water contents
>1wt% that lead to high-pressure ice mantles further slow phosphorus cycling. Paradoxically,
the maximum water content allowing use of O2 as a biosignature, 0.2wt%, is consistent with no water
based on mass and radius. Thus, the utility of an O2 biosignature likely requires the direct detection
of both water and land on a planet.
