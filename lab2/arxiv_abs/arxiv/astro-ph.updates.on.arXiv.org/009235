We present ALMA rest-frame 230 GHz continuum and CO(2-1) line observations of the nearby Compton-thick
Seyfert galaxy ESO428-G14, with angular resolution 0.7 arcsec (78 pc). We detect CO(2-1) emission
from spiral arms and a circum-nuclear ring with 200 pc radius, and from a transverse gas lane with
size of $\sim100$ pc, which crosses the nucleus and connects the two portions the circumnuclear
ring. The molecular gas in the host galaxy is distributed in a rotating disk with intrinsic circular
velocity $v_{rot}=135$ km/s, inclination $i=57$ deg, and dynamical mass $M_{dyn }=5\times 10^9~\rm
M_{\odot}$ within a radius of $\sim 1$ kpc. In the inner 100 pc region CO is distributed in a equatorial
bar, whose kinematics is highly perturbed and consistent with an inflow of gas towards the AGN. This
inner CO bar overlaps with the most obscured, Compton-thick region seen in X-rays. We derive a column
density of $\rm N(H_2) \approx 2\times10^{23}~ cm^{-2}$ in this region, suggesting that molecular
gas may contribute significantly to the AGN obscuration. We detect a molecular outflow with a total
outflow rate $\rm \dot M_{of}\approx 0.8~M_{\odot}/yr$, distributed along a bi-conical structure
with size of $700$ pc on both sides of the AGN. The bi-conical outflow is also detected in the $\rm H_2$
emission line at 2.12 $\mu$m, which traces a warmer nuclear outflow located within 170 pc from the
AGN. This suggests that the outflow cools with increasing distance from the AGN. We find that the
hard X-ray emitting nuclear region mapped with Chandra is CO-deprived, but filled with warm molecular
gas traced by $\rm H_2$ - thus confirming that the hard (3-6 keV) continuum and Fe K$\alpha$ emission
are due to scattering from dense neutral clouds in the ISM.
