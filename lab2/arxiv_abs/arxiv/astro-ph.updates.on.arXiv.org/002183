We investigate the dynamics of triaxial collapse (in the absence of rotations) in terms of a new set
of nine dimensionless variables. These nine variables correspond to the eigenvalues of the deformation
tensor, the tensor of velocity derivatives and the Hessian of the gravitational potential. Starting
from the well-known equations of Bond and Myers, we derive a new set of evolution equations for the
nine eigenvalues and examine their dynamics in phase space. The main advantage of this form is that
it eliminates the complicated elliptic integrals that appear in the axes evolution equations and
is a more natural way to understand the interplay between the perturbations. This paper, the first
in a series of two, focuses on the density-velocity dynamics. In the linear regime, the Zel'dovich
approximation implies that the three tensors are proportional; the proportionality constant
is set by demanding `no decaying modes'. This relation is extended into the non-linear regime by
imposing the condition `no perturbations at the big bang epoch'. The resulting non-linear relation
traces out a plane in the 6D phase space of perturbations: at late times all density and velocity fluctuations
lie on this plane to an accuracy of 1%. We also analyze the relation between the density and the sum
of the eigenvalues of the deformation tensor and find that equality only holds for very early epochs
breaking down at late times even for `linear' values of the density contrast. Finally, we examine
the dynamics in the 2D density-velocity divergence phase space and discuss the relation between
the scatter and the shear component of the velocity field. As an application, we numerically compute
the one point PDFs of the two variables and compare to some existing forms in the literature. We find
that this simple model is able to reproduce the behavior in voids rather well, but disagrees at high
densities.
