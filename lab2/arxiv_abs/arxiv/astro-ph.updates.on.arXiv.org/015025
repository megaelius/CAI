Small-scale umbral brightenings (SSUBs), umbral microjets, spikes or short dynamic fibrils (SDFs),
and umbral dark fibrils are found in any observation of the chromosphere with sufficient spatial
resolution. We study the spatial and spectral co-evolution of SDFs, SSUBs, and umbral flashes in
Ca II 8542 spectral profiles. We produce models that generate the spectral profiles for all classes
of features using non-LTE radiative transfer with a recent version of the NICOLE inversion code.
We find that both bright (SSUBs) and dark (SDFs) structures are described with a continuous feature
in the parameter space that is distinct from the surroundings even in pixel-by-pixel inversions.
We find a phase difference between such features and umbral flashes in both inverted line-of-sight
velocities and timing of the brightenings. For umbral flashes themselves we resolve, for the first
time in inversion-based semi-empirical modelling, the pre-flash downflows, post-flash upflows,
and the counter-flows present during the umbral flash phase. We further present a simple time-dependent
cartoon model that explains the dynamics and spectral profiles of both fine structure, dark and
bright, and umbral flashes in umbral chromospheres. Conclusions. The similarity of the profiles
between the brightenings and umbral flashes, the pattern of velocities obtained from the inversions,
and the phase relationships between the structures all lead us to put forward that all dynamic umbral
chromospheric structures observed to this date are a locally delayed or locally early portion of
the oscillatory flow pattern that generates flashes, secondary to the steepening large-scale
acoustic waves at its source. Essentially, SSUBs are part of the same shock or merely compression
front responsible for the spatially larger umbral flash phenomenon, but out of phase with the broader
oscillation.
