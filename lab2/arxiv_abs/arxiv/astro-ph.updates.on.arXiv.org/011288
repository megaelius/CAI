Weak lensing has proven to be an efficient method to constrain models of structure formation and
reveal the nature of dark energy. So far, most weak lensing studies have focused on the shear field
that can be measured directly from the ellipticity of background galaxies. However, within the
context of forthcoming full-sky weak lensing surveys such as Euclid, convergence maps offer an
important advantage over shear fields in terms of cosmological exploitation. While carrying the
same information, the lensing signal is more compressed in the convergence maps than in the shear
field, simplifying otherwise computationally expensive analyses, for instance non-Gaussianity
studies. However, the inversion of the non-local shear field requires accurate control of systematic
effects due to holes in the data field, field borders, noise and the fact that the shear is not a direct
observable (reduced shear). In this paper, we present the two mass inversion methods that are being
included in the official Euclid data processing pipeline: the standard Kaiser & Squires method
(KS) and a new mass inversion method (KS+) that aims to reduce the information loss during the mass
inversion. This new method is based on the KS methodology and includes corrections for mass mapping
systematic effects. The results of the KS+ method are compared to the original implementation of
the KS method in its simplest form, using the Euclid Flagship mock galaxy catalogue. In particular,
we estimate the quality of the reconstruction by comparing the two-point correlation functions,
third- and fourth-order moments obtained from shear and convergence maps, and we analyse each systematic
effect independently and simultaneously. We show that the KS+ method reduces substantially the
errors on the two-point correlation function and moments compared to the KS method. In particular,
we show...
