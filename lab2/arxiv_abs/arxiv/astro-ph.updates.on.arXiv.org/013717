We present 3, 15, and 33 GHz imaging towards galaxy nuclei and extranuclear star-forming regions
using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array as part of the Star Formation in Radio Survey. With $3-33$
GHz radio spectra, we measured the spectral indices and corresponding thermal (free-free) emission
fractions for a sample of 335 discrete regions having significant detections in at least two radio
bands. After removing 14 likely background galaxies, we find that the median thermal fraction at
33 GHz is $92 \pm 0.8\%$ with a median absolute deviation of $11\%$, when a two-component power-law
model is adopted to fit the radio spectrum. Limiting the sample to 238 sources that are confidently
identified as star-forming regions, and not affected by potential AGN contamination (i.e., having
galactocentric radii $r_{\rm G} \geq 250$ pc), results in a median thermal fraction of $93 \pm 0.8
\%$ with a median absolute deviation of $10\%$. We further measure the thermal fraction at 33 GHz
for 163 regions identified at 7" resolution to be $94 \pm 0.8 \%$ with a median absolute deviation
of $8\%$. Together, these results confirm that free-free emission dominates the radio spectra
of star-forming regions on scales up to $\sim$500 pc in normal star-forming galaxies. We additionally
find a factor of $\sim$1.6 increase in the scatter of the measured spectral index and thermal fraction
distributions as a function of decreasing galactocentric radius. This trend is likely reflective
of the continuous star-formation activity occurring in the galaxy centers, resulting a larger
contribution of diffuse nonthermal emission relative to star-forming regions in the disk.
