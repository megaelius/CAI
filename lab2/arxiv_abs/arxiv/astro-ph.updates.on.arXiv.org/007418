We theoretically quantify the impact of observational errors on the recovered age for stars in MS
and RGB phases. We adopted Teff, [Fe/H], Delta_nu and nu_max as observational constraints. Artificial
stars were sampled from a reference isochrone and subjected to random perturbation to simulate
observational errors. Their ages were then recovered by means of a MCMC approach. The differences
between the recovered and true ages were modelled against the errors in the observables by means
of linear models and projection pursuit regression models. From linear models we find that no age
error source dominates. For MS the most important error source is Teff. An offset of 75 K accounts
for an underestimation of the stellar age from 0.4 to 0.6 Gyr for initial and terminal MS. An error
of 2.5% in nu_max accounted for about -0.3 Gyr. A 0.1 dex error in [Fe/H] resulted particularly important
only at the end of the MS, with an age error of -0.4 Gyr. For the RGB phase the dominant source of uncertainty
is nu_max, causing an underestimation of about 0.6 Gyr; the offset in the effective temperature
and Delta_nu caused respectively an underestimation and overestimation of 0.3 Gyr. We find that
the inference from the linear model is a good proxy for that from projection pursuit regression models,
so that linear models can be safely used thanks to its broader generalizability. Finally, we explored
the impact on age estimates of adding the luminosity to the other observational constraints. We
assumed - for computational reasons - a 2.5% error in luminosity, much lower than the average error
in the Gaia DR2 catalogue. Even in this optimistic case, the luminosity does not increase precision
of age estimates. Moreover, the luminosity resulted as a major contributor to the variability in
the estimated ages, accounting for an error of about -0.3 Gyr in the explored evolutionary phases.
