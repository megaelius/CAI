Earth-like planets form mostly from dry refractory materials in the inner regions of protoplanetary
disks; however, they might become habitable if water and organic molecules are delivered to their
surfaces and atmospheres by planetesimals formed beyond the sublimation front of water. Complex
organic molecules (COMs), which are the seeds of prebiotic material and precursors of amino acids
and sugars, form in the icy mantles of dust grains but cannot be detected remotely unless they are
heated and released to the gas phase. Around solar-mass stars, water and COMs only sublimate in the
inner few au of the disk, making them extremely difficult to spatially resolve and study. Sudden
increases in the luminosity of the central star will quickly expand the snow line to larger radii,
as seen previously in the FU Ori outburst of the young star V883 Ori. In this paper, we take advantage
of the rapid increase in disk temperature of V883 Ori to detect and analyze five different COMs, methanol,
acetone, acetonitrile, acetaldehyde, and methyl formate, in spatially-resolved submillimeter
observations. The COMs emission observed in V883 Ori traces fresh sublimates at the edges of the
water sublimation front, where the disk becomes optically thin. COMs abundances in V883 Ori are
much more similar to those in comets than to those in the protostellar core IRAS 16293 B, which represent
older and younger evolutionary stages, respectively. The chemical evolution of COMs continues
after the volatiles are incorporated to the disk and during the planet formation process. Since
the duration of the stellar outbursts ($\sim$100 yr) is shorter than the gas-phase chemical timescale
($\sim10^4$ yr), high-resolution observations of FU Ori objects such as V883 Ori open a new and truly
unique window to trace the composition and chemical evolution of ices in protoplanetary disks.
