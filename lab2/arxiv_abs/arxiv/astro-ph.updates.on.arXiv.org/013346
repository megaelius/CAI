MHD turbulence is likely to play an important role in several astrophysical scenarios where the
magnetic Reynolds is very large. Numerically, these cases can be studied efficiently by means of
Large Eddy Simulations, in which the computational resources are used to evolve the system only
up to a finite grid size. The resolution is not fine enough to capture all the relevant small-scale
physics at play, which is instead effectively modeled by a set of additional terms in the evolution
equations, dubbed as sub-grid-scale model. Here we extend such approach, commonly used in non-relativistic/non-magnetic/incompressible
fluid dynamics, applying the so-called gradient model to a general set of balance-law equations,
that includes the relevant case in which a non-trivial inversion of conserved to primitive fields
is needed. In particular, we focus on the relativistic compressible ideal MHD scenario, providing
for the first time (and for any equation of state) all the additional sub-grid-scale terms. As an
application, we consider box simulations of the relativistic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability,
which is also the first mechanism responsible for the magnetic field amplification in binary neutron
star mergers and cannot yet be fully captured by the finest-grid and longest simulations available.
The performance of our model is numerically assessed by comparing it to the residuals arising from
the filtering of high-resolution simulations. We find that the model can fit very well those residuals
from resolutions a few times higher. Although the application shown here explicitly considers
the Minkowski metric, it can be directly extended to general relativity, thus settling the basis
to implement the gradient sub-grid model in a GRMHD binary merger. Our results suggest that this
approach will be potentially able to unveil much better the small-scale dynamics achievable in
full GRMHD simulations.
