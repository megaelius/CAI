Dust emission, an important diagnostic of star formation and ISM mass throughout the Universe,
can be powered by sources unrelated to ongoing star formation. In the framework of the DustPedia
project we have set out to disentangle the radiation of the ongoing star formation from that of the
older stellar populations. This is done through detailed, 3D radiative transfer simulations of
face-on spiral galaxies. In this particular study, we focus on NGC 1068, which contains an active
galactic nucleus (AGN). The effect of diffuse dust heating by AGN (beyond the torus) was so far only
investigated for quasars. This additional dust heating source further contaminates the broadband
fluxes on which classic galaxy modelling tools rely to derive physical properties. We aim to fit
a realistic model to the observations of NGC 1068 and quantify the contribution of the several dust
heating sources. Our model is able to reproduce the global spectral energy distribution of the galaxy.
It matches the resolved optical and infrared images fairly well, but deviates in the UV and the submm.
We find a strong wavelength dependency of AGN contamination to the broadband fluxes. It peaks in
the MIR, drops in the FIR, but rises again at submm wavelengths. We quantify the contribution of the
dust heating sources in each 3D dust cell and find a median value of 83% for the star formation component.
The AGN contribution is measurable at the percentage level in the disc, but quickly increases in
the inner few 100 pc, peaking above 90%. This is the first time the phenomenon of an AGN heating the
diffuse dust beyond its torus is quantified in a nearby star-forming galaxy. NGC 1068 only contains
a weak AGN, meaning this effect can be stronger in galaxies with a more luminous AGN. This could significantly
impact the derived star formation rates and ISM masses for such systems.
