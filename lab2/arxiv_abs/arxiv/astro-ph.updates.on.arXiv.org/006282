We propose a methodological framework to perform forward asteroseismic modeling of stars with
a convective core, based on gravity-mode oscillations. These probe the near-core region in the
deep stellar interior. The modeling relies on a set of observed high-precision oscillation frequencies
of low-degree coherent gravity modes with long lifetimes and their observational uncertainties.
Identification of the mode degree and azimuthal order is assumed to be achieved from rotational
splitting and/or from period spacing patterns. This paper has two major outcomes. The first is a
comprehensive list and discussion of the major uncertainties of theoretically predicted gravity-mode
oscillation frequencies based on linear pulsation theory, caused by fixing choices of the input
physics for evolutionary models. Guided by a hierarchy among these uncertainties of theoretical
frequencies, we subsequently provide a global methodological scheme to achieve forward asteroseismic
modeling. We properly take into account correlations amongst the free parameters included in stellar
models. Aside from the stellar mass, metalicity and age, the major parameters to be estimated are
the near-core rotation rate, the amount of convective core overshooting, and the level of chemical
mixing in the radiative zones. This modeling scheme allows for maximum likelihood estimation of
the stellar parameters for fixed input physics of the equilibrium models, followed by stellar model
selection considering various choices of the input physics. Our approach uses the Mahalanobis
distance instead of the often used $\chi^2$ statistic and includes heteroscedasticity. It provides
estimation of the unknown variance of the theoretically predicted oscillation frequencies.
