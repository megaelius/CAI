With an orbital distance comparable to that of Saturn in the solar system, \bpic b is the closest (semi-major
axis $\simeq$\,9\,au) exoplanet that has been imaged to orbit a star. Thus it offers unique opportunities
for detailed studies of its orbital, physical, and atmospheric properties, and of disk-planet
interactions. With the exception of the discovery observations in 2003 with NaCo at the Very Large
Telescope (VLT), all following astrometric measurements relative to \bpic have been obtained
in the southwestern part of the orbit, which severely limits the determination of the planet's orbital
parameters. We aimed at further constraining \bpic b orbital properties using more data, and, in
particular, data taken in the northeastern part of the orbit. We used SPHERE at the VLT to precisely
monitor the orbital motion of beta \bpic b since first light of the instrument in 2014. We were able
to monitor the planet until November 2016, when its angular separation became too small (125 mas,
i.e., 1.6\,au) and prevented further detection. We redetected \bpic b on the northeast side of the
disk at a separation of 139\,mas and a PA of 30$^{\circ}$ in September 2018. The planetary orbit is
now well constrained. With a semi-major axis (sma) of $a = 9.0 \pm 0.5$ au (1 $\sigma $), it definitely
excludes previously reported possible long orbital periods, and excludes \bpic b as the origin
of photometric variations that took place in 1981. We also refine the eccentricity and inclination
of the planet. From an instrumental point of view, these data demonstrate that it is possible to detect,
if they exist, young massive Jupiters that orbit at less than 2 au from a star that is 20 pc away.
