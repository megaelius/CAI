During its four years of photometric observations, the Kepler space telescope detected thousands
of exoplanets and exoplanet candidates. One of Kepler's greatest heritages has been the confirmation
and characterization of hundreds of multi-planet systems via Transit Timing Variations (TTVs).
However, there are many interesting candidate systems displaying TTVs on such long time scales
that the existing Kepler observations are of insufficient length to confirm and characterize them
by means of this technique. To continue with Kepler's unique work we have organized the "Kepler Object
of Interest Network" (KOINet). The goals of KOINet are, among others, to complete the TTV curves
of systems where Kepler did not cover the interaction timescales well. KOINet has been operational
since March, 2014. Here we show some promising first results obtained from analyzing seven primary
transits of KOI-0410.01, KOI-0525.01, KOI-0760.01, and KOI-0902.01 in addition to Kepler data,
acquired during the first and second observing seasons of KOINet. While carefully choosing the
targets we set demanding constraints about timing precision (at least 1 minute) and photometric
precision (as good as 1 part per thousand) that were achieved by means of our observing strategies
and data analysis techniques. For KOI-0410.01, new transit data revealed a turn-over of its TTVs.
We carried out an in-depth study of the system, that is identified in the NASA's Data Validation Report
as false positive. Among others, we investigated a gravitationally-bound hierarchical triple
star system, and a planet-star system. While the simultaneous transit fitting of ground and space-based
data allowed for a planet solution, we could not fully reject the three-star scenario. New data,
already scheduled in the upcoming 2018 observing season, will set tighter constraints on the nature
of the system.
