This paper presents a new Tunable Filter Instrument for the SOAR telescope. The Brazilian Tunable
Filter Imager (BTFI) is a versatile, new technology, tunable optical imager to be used in seeing-limited
mode and at higher spatial fidelity using the SAM Ground-Layer Adaptive Optics facility at the SOAR
telescope. The instrument opens important new science capabilities for the SOAR community, from
studies of the centers of nearby galaxies and the insterstellar medium to statistical cosmological
investigations. The BTFI takes advantage of three new technologies. The imaging Bragg Tunable
Filter concept utilizes Volume Phase Holographic Gratings in a double-pass configuration, as
a tunable filter, while a new Fabry-Perot (FP) concept involves technologies which allow a single
FP etalon to act over a large range of interference orders and spectral resolutions. Both technologies
will be in the same instrument. Spectral resolutions spanning the range between 25 and 30,000 can
be achieved through the use of iBTF at low resolution and scanning FPs beyond R ~2,000. The third new
technologies in BTFI is the use of EMCCDs for rapid and cyclically wavelength scanning thus mitigating
the damaging effect of atmospheric variability through data acquisition. An additional important
feature of the instrument is that it has two optical channels which allow for the simultaneous recording
of the narrow-band, filtered image with the remaining (complementary) broad-band light. This
avoids the uncertainties inherent in tunable filter imaging using a single detector. The system
was designed to supply tunable filter imaging with a field-of-view of 3 arcmin on a side, sampled
at 0.12" for direct Nasmyth seeing-limited area spectroscopy and for SAM's visitor instrument
port for GLAO-fed area spectroscopy. The instrument has seen first light, as a SOAR visitor instrument.
It is now in comissioning phase.
