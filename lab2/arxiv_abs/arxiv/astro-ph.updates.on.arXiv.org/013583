A determination of the mass function (MF) of stellar clusters can be quite dependent on the range
of measured masses, the fitting technique, and the analytic function that is being fit to the data.
Here, we use HST/WFPC2 data of NGC 1711, a stellar cluster in the Large Magellanic Cloud, as a test
case to explore a range of possible determinations of the MF from a single dataset. We employ the analytic
modified lognormal power-law (MLP) distribution, a hybrid function that has a peaked lognormal-like
body and a power-law tail at intermediate and high masses. A fit with the MLP has the advantage that
the resulting best-fit function can be either a hybrid function, a pure lognormal, or a pure power
law, in different limits of the function. The completeness limit for the observations means that
the data contains masses above $\sim 0.90\,M_{\odot}$. In this case, the MLP fits yield essentially
a pure power-law MF. We demonstrate that the nonlinear regression/least-squares approach is not
justified since the underlying assumptions are not satisfied. By using maximum likelihood estimation,
which is independent of binning, we find a best-fit functional form $dN/d\ln m \propto m^{-\alpha}$,
where $\alpha = 1.72 \pm 0.05$ or $1.75 \pm 0.05$ for two different theoretical isochrone models,
respectively. Furthermore, we explore the possibility of systematic errors in the determination
of the power-law index due to the depth of the observations. When we combine the observational data
with artificially generated data from the lognormal Chabrier IMF for masses below $0.90\, M_{\odot}$,
the best fit MLP is a hybrid function but with a steeper asymptotic slope i.e., $\alpha = 2.04 \pm 0.07$.
This illustrates the systematic uncertainties in commonly used MF parameters that can depend on
the range of data that is fitted.
