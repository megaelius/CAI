The growth and migration of planetesimals in a young protoplanetary disc are fundamental to planet
formation. In all models of early growth, there are several processes that can inhibit grains from
reaching larger sizes. Nevertheless, observations suggest that growth of planetesimals must
be rapid. If a small number of 100 km sized planetesimals do manage to form in the disc, then gas drag
effects could enable them to efficiently accrete small solids from beyond their gravitationally
focused cross-section. This gas drag-enhanced accretion can allow planetesimals to grow at rapid
rates, in principle. We present self-consistent hydrodynamics simulations with direct particle
integration and gas drag coupling to estimate the rate of planetesimal growth due to pebble accretion.
Wind tunnel simulations are used to explore a range of particle sizes and disc conditions. We also
explore analytic estimates of planetesimal growth and numerically integrate planetesimal drift
due to the accretion of small solids. Our results show that, for almost every case that we consider,
there is a clearly preferred particle size for accretion that depends on the properties of the accreting
planetesimal and the local disc conditions. For solids much smaller than the preferred particle
size, accretion rates are significantly reduced as the particles are entrained in the gas and flow
around the planetesimal. Solids much larger than the preferred size accrete at rates consistent
with gravitational focusing. Our analytic estimates for pebble accretion highlight the timescales
that are needed for the growth of large objects under different disc conditions and initial planetesimal
sizes.
