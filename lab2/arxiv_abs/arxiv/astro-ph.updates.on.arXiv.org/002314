We present high resolution transmission spectra of giant planet atmospheres from a coupled 3-D
atmospheric dynamics and transmission spectrum model that includes Doppler shifts which arise
from winds and planetary motion. We model jovian planets covering more than two orders of magnitude
in incident flux, corresponding to planets with 0.9 to 55 day orbital periods around solar-type
stars. The results of our 3-D dynamical models reveal certain aspects of high resolution transmission
spectra that are not present in simple 1-D models. We find that the hottest planets experience strong
substellar to anti-stellar (SSAS) winds, resulting in transmission spectra with net blue shifts
of up to 3 km s$^{-1}$, whereas less irradiated planets show almost no net Doppler shifts. Compared
to 1-D models, peak line strengths are significantly reduced for the hottest atmospheres owing
to Doppler broadening from a combination of rotation (which is faster for close-in planets under
the assumption of tidal locking) and atmospheric winds. Finally, high resolution transmission
spectra may be useful in studying the atmospheres of exoplanets with optically thick clouds since
line cores for very strong transitions should remain optically thick to very high altitude. High
resolution transmission spectra are an excellent observational test for the validity of 3-D atmospheric
dynamics models, because they provide a direct probe of wind structures and heat circulation. Ground-based
exoplanet spectroscopy is currently on the verge of being able to verify some of our modeling predictions,
most notably the dependence of SSAS winds on insolation. We caution that interpretation of high
resolution transmission spectra based on 1-D atmospheric models may be inadequate, as 3-D atmospheric
motions can produce a noticeable effect on the absorption signatures.
