We report serendipitous detections of line emission with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) in band 3, 6, and 7 in the central parsec down to within 1" around Sgr A* at an up to now highest
resolution (<0.5") view of the Galactic Center (GC) in the sub-millimeter (sub-mm) domain. From
the 100 GHz continuum and the H39\alpha emission we obtain a uniform electron temperature around
6000 K for the minispiral. The spectral index of Sgr A* is ~ 0.5 at 100 - 250 GHz and ~ 0.0 at 230 - 340 GHz.
The bright sources in the center show spectral indices around -0.1 implying Bremsstrahlung emission,
while dust emission is emerging in the minispiral exterior. Apart from CS, which is most widespread
in the center, H13CO+, HC3N, SiO, SO, C2H, CH3OH, 13CS and N2H+ are also detected. The bulk of the clumpy
emission regions is at positive velocities and in a region confined by the minispiral northern arm,
bar and the sources IRS 3 and 7. Although partly spatially overlapping with the radio recombination
line (RRL) emission at same negative velocities, the relation to the minispiral remains unclear.
A likely explanation is an infalling clump consisting of denser cloud cores embedded in diffuse
gas. The central association of clouds (CA) shows three times higher CS/X (X: any other observed
molecule) ratios than the circumnuclear disk (CND) suggesting a combination of higher excitation,
by a temperature gradient and/or IR-pumping, and abundance enhancement due to UV- and/or X-ray
emission. Hence, we conclude that this CA is closer to the center than the CND is to the center. Moreover,
we find molecular emission at velocities up to 200 km s-1. ...
