We present far-IR photometry and infrared spectrum of the z=3.9114 quasar/starburst composite
system APM 08279+5255 obtained using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA)/HAWC+
and the Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared Spectrograph (IRS). We decompose the IR-to-radio spectral
energy distribution (SED), sampled in 51 bands, using (i) a model comprised of two-temperature
modified blackbodies (MBB) and radio power-laws and (ii) a semi-analytic model, which also accounts
for emission from a clumpy torus. The latter is more realistic but requires a well-sampled SED, as
possible here. In the former model, we find temperatures of T_warm = 296^17_15 K and T_cold = 110^3_3
K for the warm and cold dust components, respectively. This model suggests that the cold dust component
dominates the FIR energy budget (66%) but contributes only 17% to the total IR luminosity. Based
on the torus models, we infer an inclination angle of i=15^8_8 degree and the presence of silicate
emission, in accordance with the Type-1 active galactic nucleus nature of APM 08279+5255. Accounting
for the torus' contribution to the FIR luminosity, we find a lensing-corrected star formation rate
of SFR=3075x(4/mu_L) Msun yr^-1. We find that the central quasar contributes 30% to the FIR luminosity
but dominates the total IR luminosity (93%). The 30% correction is in contrast to the 90% reported
in previous work. In addition, the IR luminosity inferred from the torus model is a factor of two higher.
These differences highlight the importance of adopting physically motivated models to properly
account for IR emission in high-z quasars, which is now possible with SOFIA/HAWC+.
