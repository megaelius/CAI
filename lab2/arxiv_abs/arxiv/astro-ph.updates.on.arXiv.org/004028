We present results of a global survey of single-pixel intensity power spectra from a 12-hour time
period on June 26, 2013 in a 1600x1600 pixel region from five channels of the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument. We extract single-pixel time series from
a derotated image sequence, fit models to the power spectra of these time series, and study the spatial
dependence of the model parameters. Two power spectra models are considered: (1) a 3-parameter
power-law + tail model and (2) a power-law + tail model + 3-parameter localized Gaussian, which models
a periodicity. In general, spectra are well-described by at least one of these two models for all
pixel locations, with an average data/model correlation of 0.93 and a standard deviation of 0.1.
The spatial distribution of best-fit parameter values for the models are shown to provide new and
unique insights into turbulent, quiescent and periodic features in the EUV solar corona and upper
photosphere. Findings include: individual model parameters correspond clearly and directly
to visible solar features; detection of numerous quasi-periodic 3- and 5-minute oscillations;
observational identification of concentrated magnetic flux as regions of largest power-law indices
(n); identification of unique spectral features of coronal holes and filaments; identification
of sporadic and pervasive 5-minute oscillations throughout the corona; detection of the known
global ~4.0-minute chromospheric oscillation; "Coronal Bullseyes" appearing as radially decaying
periodicities over sunspots and sporadic foot-point regions; and "Penumbral Periodic Voids"
appearing as broad rings around sunspots in 1600 and 1700 {\AA} in which spectra contain no statistically
significant periodic component.
