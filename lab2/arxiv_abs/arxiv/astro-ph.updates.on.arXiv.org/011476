The early optical emission of gamma-ray bursts gives an opportunity to understand the central engine
and first stages of these events. About 30\% of GRBs present flares whose origin is still a subject
of discussion. We present optical photometry of GRB 180620A with the COATLI telescope and RATIR
instrument. COATLI started to observe from the end of prompt emission at $T+39.3$~s and RATIR from
$T+121.4$~s. We supplement the optical data with the X-ray light curve from \emph{Swift}/XRT.
%The optical and X-ray light curves show very unusual behavior with features clearly beyond the
standard fireball model. We observe an optical flare from $T+110$ to $T+550$~s, with a temporal
index decay $\alpha_\mathrm{O,decay}=1.32\pm 0.01$, and a $\Delta t/t=1.63$, which we interpret
as the signature of a reverse shock component. After the initial normal decay the light curves show
a long plateau from $T+500$ to $T+7800$~s both in X-rays and the optical before decaying again after
an achromatic jet break at $T+7800$~s. Fluctuations are seen during the plateau phase in the optical.
Adding to the complexity of GRB afterglows, the plateau phase (typically associated with the coasting
phase of the jet) is seen in this object after the ``normal'' decay phase (emitted during the deceleration
phase of the jet) and the jet break phase occurs directly after the plateau. We suggest that this sequence
of events can be explained by a rapid deceleration of the jet with $t_d\lesssim 40$ s due to the high
density of the environment ($\approx 100$ cm$^{-3}$) followed by reactivation of the central engine
which causes the flare and powers the plateau phase.
