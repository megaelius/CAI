It is important to clarify where and when rocky and icy planetesimals are formed in a viscously evolving
disk. We wish to understand how local runaway pile-up of solids occurs inside or outside the snow
line. We assume an icy pebble contains micron-sized silicate grains that are uniformly mixed with
ice and are released during the ice sublimation. Using a local one-dimensional code, we solve the
radial drift and the turbulent diffusion of solids and the water vapor, taking account of their sublimation/condensation
around the snow line. We systematically investigate effects of back-reactions of the solids to
gas on the radial drift and diffusion of solids, scale height evolution of the released silicate
particles, and possible difference in effective viscous parameters between that for turbulent
diffusion ($\alpha_{\rm tur}$) and that for the gas accretion rate onto the central star ($\alpha_{\rm
acc}$). We study the dependence on the ratio of the solid mass flux to the gas ($F_{\rm p/g}$). We show
that the favorable locations for the pile-up of silicate grains and icy pebbles are the regions in
the proximity of the water snow line inside and outside it, respectively. We found that runaway pile-ups
occur when both the back-reactions for radial drift and diffusion are included. In the case with
only the back-reaction for the radial drift, no runaway pile-up is found except for extremely high
pebble flux, while the condition of streaming instability can be satisfied for relatively large
$F_{\rm p/g}$ as found in the past literatures. If the back-reactions for radial diffusion is considered,
the runaway pile-up occurs for reasonable value of pebble flux. The runaway pile-up of silicate
grains that would lead to formation of rocky planetesimals occurs for $\alpha_{\rm tur} \ll \alpha_{\rm
acc}$, while the runaway pile-up of icy pebbles is favored for $\alpha_{\rm tur} \sim \alpha_{\rm
acc}$.
