Transmission spectroscopy provides us with information on the atmospheric properties at the limb,
which is often intuitively assumed to be a narrow annulus around the planet. Consequently, studies
have focused on the effect of atmospheric horizontal heterogeneities along the limb. Here we demonstrate
that the region probed in transmission -- the limb -- extends significantly toward the day and night
sides of the planet. We show that the strong day-night thermal and compositional gradients expected
on synchronous exoplanets create sufficient heterogeneities across the limb to result in important
systematic effects on the spectrum and bias its interpretation. To quantify these effects, we developed
a 3D radiative transfer model able to generate transmission spectra of atmospheres based on 3D atmospheric
structures. We first produce synthetic JWST observations from a simulation of GJ 1214b and demonstrate
the necessity of a real 3D approach to model data for such precise observatories. Second, we investigate
how day-night temperature gradients cause a systematic bias in retrieval analysis performed with
1D forward models. For that purpose we synthesize a large set of forward spectra for prototypical
HD 209458 b and GJ 1214 b type planets varying the temperatures of the day and night sides as well as
the width of the transition region. We then perform typical retrieval analyses and compare the retrieved
parameters to the ground truth of the input model. This study reveals systematic biases on the retrieved
temperature (found to be higher than the terminator temperature) and abundances. This is due to
the fact that the hotter dayside is more extended vertically and screens the nightside. These biases
are difficult to detect as the 1D profiles used in the retrieval are found to provide an excellent
match to the observed spectra. This needs to be kept in mind when interpreting real data.
