The intensity and effects of early impact bombardment on the major satellites of the giant planets
during an episode of giant planet migration is still poorly known. We use a combination of dynamical
N-body and Monte Carlo simulations to determine impact probabilities, impact velocities, and
expected masses that collide with these satellites to determine the chronology of impacts during
the migration. Volatile loss through bombardment is typically 20% for Miranda, a few percents for
the larger Uranian satellites and negligible for the Galilean satellites. Due to its small size
and the high impact velocity there is a >99% chance that Miranda suffered a catastrophic impact that
shattered the satellite. Subsequent re-accretion from a circum-Uranian ring could account for
its peculiar surface morphology and low density. The probability to destroy Ariel and Umbriel is
15% and 1% for Titania and Oberon. Approximately 90% of the mass in planetesimals that passes through
the Jovian and Uranian satellite systems (about $4 {\rm \ M_{\oplus}}$ and $2 {\rm \ M_{\oplus}}$
respectively) does so in about 15 Myr. This extremely rapid and intense bombardment causes repeated
local crustal melting on all satellites. The combination of these effects results in an entirely
different impact chronology than that of the inner solar system. We conclude that the simple extrapolation
of the lunar chronology to the outer solar system satellites is not correct. The tail end (after 25
Myr) of the chronology function has an e-folding time of 100 Myr at Jupiter, but follows a cumulative
Weibull distribution at Uranus, making direct comparisons between the gas and ice giant planets
difficult. Based on our results the surfaces of the Uranian satellites, Callisto, and possibly
Ganymede, are all about the same age, and are roughly 150 Myr younger than the timing of the dynamical
instability.
