The Deep Ecliptic Survey (DES) discovered hundreds of Kuiper Belt objects from 1998-2005. Extensive
follow-up observations have yielded 304 objects with well-determined orbits and dynamical classifications.
The DES search fields are well documented, enabling us to calculate the probability on each frame
of detecting an object with its particular orbital parameters and absolute magnitude at a randomized
point in its orbit. The detection probabilities range from a maximum of 0.32 for the 3:2 resonant
object 2002GF32 to a minimum of 3*10^-8 for the highly-eccentric Scattered object 2003FH127. By
grouping individual objects together by dynamical classes, we can estimate the distributions
of four parameters that define each class: semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, and object
size. Using the absolute magnitude (H-magnitude) as a proxy for the object size, we fit a power law
to the number of objects vs. H magnitude for 8 classes with with at least 5 detected members (246 objects).
The Classical objects, which have observed values from 5<=H<=7.2, are best fit with a power-law
slope of alpha=0.989+/-0.011. The slopes of the magnitude distributions for the seven next most
populated dynamical classes (Scattered, Centaur, and 5 resonances) are consistent with the power-law
relation of the Classicals, provided that the absolute number of objects is scaled. Scattered objects
are approximately as numerous as Classical objects, while there are only a quarter as many 3:2 objects
as Classicals. The exception to the power law relation is the Centuars, which were smaller, from
7.5<H<11, and best fit by a power law with alpha=0.44+/-0.04. Based on the Classical-derived
magnitude distribution, the total number of objects (H<=7) in each class are: Classical (2200+/-400
objects), Scattered (2200+/-400), 3:2 (550+/-100), 2:1 (330+/-60), 5:2 (550+/-100), 7:4 (66+/-12),
and 5:3 (66+/-12).
