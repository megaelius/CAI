The remarkable optical properties of the solar gravitational lens (SGL) include major brightness
amplification (~1e11 at wavelength of 1 um) and extreme angular resolution (~1e-10 arcsec) in a
narrow field of view. A mission to the SGL carrying a modest telescope and coronagraph opens up a possibility
for direct megapixel imaging and high-resolution spectroscopy of a habitable Earth-like exoplanet
at a distance of up to 100 light years. The entire image of such a planet is compressed by the SGL into
a region with a diameter of ~1.3 km in the vicinity of the focal line. The telescope, acting as a single
pixel detector while traversing this region, can build an image of the exoplanet with kilometer-scale
resolution of its surface, enough to see its surface features and signs of habitability. We report
here on the results of our initial study of a mission to the deep outer regions of our solar system,
with the primary mission objective of conducting direct megapixel high-resolution imaging and
spectroscopy of a potentially habitable exoplanet by exploiting the remarkable optical properties
of the SGL. Our main goal was to investigate what it takes to operate spacecraft at such enormous distances
with the needed precision. Specifically, we studied i) how a space mission to the focal region of
the SGL may be used to obtain high-resolution direct imaging and spectroscopy of an exoplanet by
detecting, tracking, and studying the Einstein ring around the Sun, and ii) how such information
could be used to detect signs of life on another planet. Our results indicate that a mission to the
SGL with an objective of direct imaging and spectroscopy of a distant exoplanet is challenging,
but possible. We composed a list of recommendations on the mission architectures with risk and return
tradeoffs and discuss an enabling technology development program.
