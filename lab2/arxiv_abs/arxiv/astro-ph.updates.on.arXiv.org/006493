Rotating magnetic structures are common in astrophysics, from vortex tubes and tornados in the
Sun all the way to jets in different astrophysical systems. The physics of these objects often combine
inertial, magnetic, gas pressure and gravitational terms. Also, they often show approximate symmetries
that help simplify the otherwise rather intractable equations governing their morphology and
evolution. Here we propose a general formulation of the equations assuming axisymmetry and a self-similar
form for all variables: in spherical coordinates $(r,\theta,\phi)$, the magnetic field and plasma
velocity are taken to be of the form: ${\bf B}={\bf f}(\theta)/r^n$ and ${\bf v}={\bf g}(\theta)/r^m$,
with corresponding expressions for the scalar variables like pressure and density. Solutions
are obtained for potential, force-free, and non-force-free magnetic configurations. Potential-field
solutions can be found for all values of~$n$. Non-potential force-free solutions possess an azimuthal
component $B_\phi$ and exist only for $n\ge2$; the resulting structures are twisted and have closed
field lines but are not collimated around the system axis. In the non-force free case, including
gas pressure, the magnetic field lines acquire an additional curvature to compensate for an outward
pointing pressure gradient force. We have also considered a pure rotation situation with no gravity,
in the zero-$\beta$ limit: the solution has cylindrical geometry and twisted magnetic field lines.
The latter solutions can be helpful in producing a collimated magnetic field structure; but they
exist only when $n<0$ and $m<0$: for applications they must be matched to an external system at a finite
distance from the origin.
