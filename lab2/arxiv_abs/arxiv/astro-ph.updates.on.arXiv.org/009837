Several lines of evidence suggest that as dark matter haloes grow their scale radius increases,
and that the density in their central region drops. Major mergers seem an obvious mechanism to explain
both these phenomena, and the resulting patterns in the concentration--mass--redshift relation.
To test this possibility, we have simulated equal-mass mergers between haloes with a variety of
cosmological density profiles, placed on various different orbits. The remnants typically have
higher densities than the initial conditions, but differ only slightly from self-similar scaling
predictions. They are reasonably well fit by Einasto profiles, but have parameters distinct from
those of the initial conditions. The net internal energy available to the merger remnant, relative
to the internal energy of the initial conditions, $\kappa$, has the greatest influence on the properties
of the final mass distribution. As expected, energetic encounters produce more extended remnants
while mergers of strongly bound systems produce compact remnants. Surprisingly, however, the
scale radius of the density profile shows the opposite trend, {\it increasing} in the remnants of
low-energy encounters relative to energetic ones. Also even in the most energetic encounters,
the density within the scale radius decreases only slightly (by 10--20\%), while for very low-energy
systems it increases significantly after the merger. We conclude that while major mergers can produce
remnants that are more diffuse at large radii, they are relatively ineffective at changing the central
densities of haloes, and seem unlikely to explain the mean trends in the concentration--mass--redshift
relation.
