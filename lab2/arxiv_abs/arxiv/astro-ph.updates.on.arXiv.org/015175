We present a parametric, grid-based lens model for the galaxy cluster MACS J1149.5+2223, concentrating
on the properties of the first multiply imaged supernova Refsdal. This model complements our updated
light-traces-mass (LTM) strong-lensing model for this cluster, described in a companion paper,
and is generated using the same pipeline but with a different parametrization. Together these two
models probe different possible solutions in a relatively self-consistent manner and can be used
to examine systematic uncertainties and relevant differences between the two parameterizations.
We obtain reasonably similar (agreeing to within $\simeq1-3\sigma$, in most cases) time delays
and magnification ratios, with respect to S1, from the two different methods, although the LTM predictions
seem to be systematically shorter/smaller for some of the images. Most notably, the time delay [and
95\% CI] between the Einstein cross (in particular, image S1), and SX, the image that appeared about
a year after the original discovery of the cross, differs substantially between the parametric
method (326 [300 -- 359] days) and the LTM method (224 [198 -- 306] days), which seems to underestimates
the true reappearance time. The cause for this systematic difference is unclear at present. We speculate
on its possible origin and note that a refined measurement of SN Refsdal's properties should help
to more strongly discriminate between the two solutions, and thus between the two descriptions
for the intrinsic shape of the underlying matter distribution. We also discuss the implications
of our results for the Hubble constant.
