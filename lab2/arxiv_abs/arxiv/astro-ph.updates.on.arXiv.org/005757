Obliquity variability could play an important role in the climate and habitability of a planet.
Orbital modulations caused by planetary companions and the planet's spin axis precession due to
the torque from the host star may lead to resonant interactions and cause large-amplitude obliquity
variability. Here we consider the spin axis dynamics of Kepler-62f and Kepler-186f, both of which
reside in the habitable zone around their host stars. Using {\emph{N}}-body simulations and secular
numerical integrations, we describe their obliquity evolution for particular realizations of
the planetary systems. We then use a generalized analytic framework to characterize regions in
parameter space where the obliquity is variable with large amplitude. We find that the locations
of variability are fine-tuned over the planetary properties and system architecture in the lower-obliquity
regimes ($\lesssim 40^\circ$). As an example, assuming a rotation period of 24 hr, the obliquities
of both Kepler-62f and Kepler-186f are stable below $\sim 40^\circ$, whereas the high-obliquity
regions ($60^\circ - 90^\circ$) allow moderate variabilities. However, for some other rotation
periods of Kepler-62f or Kepler-186f, the lower-obliquity regions could become more variable
owing to resonant interactions. Even small deviations from coplanarity (e.g. mutual inclinations
$\sim 3^\circ$) could stir peak-to-peak obliquity variations up to $\sim 20^\circ$. Undetected
planetary companions and/or the existence of a satellite could also destabilize the low-obliquity
regions. In all cases, the high-obliquity region allows for moderate variations, and all obliquities
corresponding to retrograde motion (i.e. $> 90^\circ$) are stable.
