The "VISTA near-infrared YJKs survey of the Magellanic System" (VMC) is collecting deep Ks-band
time-series photometry of pulsating stars hosted by the two Magellanic Clouds and their connecting
Bridge. Here we present YJKs light curves for a sample of 717 Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) Classical
Cepheids (CCs). These data, complemented with our previous results and V magnitude from literature,
allowed us to construct a variety of period-luminosity and period-Wesenheit relationships, valid
for Fundamental, First and Second Overtone pulsators. These relations provide accurate individual
distances to CCs in the SMC over an area of more than 40 sq. deg. Adopting literature relations, we
estimated ages and metallicities for the majority of the investigated pulsators, finding that:
i) the age distribution is bimodal, with two peaks at 120+-10 and 220+-10 Myr; ii) the more metal-rich
CCs appear to be located closer to the centre of the galaxy. Our results show that the three-dimensional
distribution of the CCs in the SMC, is not planar but heavily elongated for more than 25-30 kpc approximately
in the east/north-east towards south-west direction. The young and old CCs in the SMC show a different
geometric distribution. Our data support the current theoretical scenario predicting a close
encounter or a direct collision between the Clouds some 200 Myr ago and confirm the presence of a Counter-Bridge
predicted by some models. The high precision three-dimensional distribution of young stars presented
in this paper provides a new testbed for future models exploring the formation and evolution of the
Magellanic System.
