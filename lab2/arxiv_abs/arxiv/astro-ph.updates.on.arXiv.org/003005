Two fundamental problems for extraterrestrial intelligences (ETIs) attempting to establish
interstellar communication are timing and energy consumption. Humanity's study of exoplanets
via their transit across the host star highlights a means of solving both problems. An ETI 'A' can
communicate with ETI 'B' if B is observing transiting planets in A's star system, either by building
structures to produce artificial transits observable by B, or by emitting signals at B during transit,
at significantly lower energy consumption than typical electromagnetic transmission schemes.
This can produce a network of interconnected civilisations, establishing contact via observing
each other's transits. Assuming that civilisations reside in a Galactic Habitable Zone (GHZ),
I conduct Monte Carlo Realisation simulations of the establishment and growth of this network,
and analyse its properties in the context of graph theory. I find that at any instant, only a few civilisations
are correctly aligned to communicate via transits. However, we should expect the true network to
be cumulative, where a "handshake" connection at any time guarantees connection in the future via
e.g. electromagnetic signals. In all our simulations, the cumulative network connects all civilisations
together in a complete network. If civilisations share knowledge of their network connections,
the network can be fully complete on timescales of order a hundred thousand years. Once established,
this network can connect any two civilisations either directly, or via intermediate civilisations,
with a path much less than the dimensions of the GHZ.
