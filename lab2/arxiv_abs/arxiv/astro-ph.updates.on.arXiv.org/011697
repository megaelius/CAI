It has recently been shown by Egal et al. (2017) that some types of existing meteor in-atmosphere
trajectory estimation methods may be less accurate than others, particularly when applied to high
precision optical measurements. The comparative performance of trajectory solution methods
has previously only been examined for a small number of cases. Besides the radiant, orbital accuracy
depends on the estimation of pre-atmosphere velocities, which have both random and systematic
biases. Thus it is critical to understand the uncertainty in velocity measurement inherent to each
trajectory estimation method. In this first of a series of two papers, we introduce a novel meteor
trajectory estimation method which uses the observed dynamics of meteors across stations as a global
optimization function and which does not require either a theoretical or empirical flight model
to solve for velocity. We also develop a 3D observational meteor trajectory simulator that uses
a meteor ablation model to replicate the dynamics of meteoroid flight, as a means to validate different
trajectory solvers. We both test this new method and compare it to other methods, using synthetic
meteors from three major showers spanning a wide range of velocities and geometries (Draconids,
Geminids, Perseids). We determine which meteor trajectory solving algorithm performs better
for: all-sky, moderate field of view, and high-precision narrow-field optical meteor detection
systems. The results are presented in the second paper in this series. Finally, we give detailed
equations for estimating meteor trajectories and analytically computing meteoroid orbits, and
provide the Python code of the methodology as open source software.
