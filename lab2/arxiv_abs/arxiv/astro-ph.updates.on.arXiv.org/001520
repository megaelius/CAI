A large number of high-redshift galaxies have been discovered via their narrow-band Lya line or
broad-band continuum colors in recent years. The nature of the escaping process of photons from
these early galaxies is crucial to understanding galaxy evolution and the cosmic reionization.
Here, we investigate the escape of Lya, non-ionizing UV-continuum (l = 1300 - 1600 angstrom in rest
frame), and ionizing photons (l < 912 angstrom) from galaxies by combining a cosmological hydrodynamic
simulation with three-dimensional multi-wavelength radiative transfer calculations. The galaxies
are simulated in a box of 5^3 h^-3 Mpc^3 with high resolutions using the Aquila initial condition
which reproduces a Milky Way-like galaxy at redshift z=0. We find that the escape fraction (fesc)
of these different photons shows a complex dependence on redshift and galaxy properties: fesc(Lya)
and fesc(UV) appear to evolve with redshift, and they show similar, weak correlations with galaxy
properties such as mass, star formation, metallicity, and dust content, while fesc(Ion) remains
roughly constant at ~ 0.2 from z ~ 0 - 10, and it does not show clear dependence on galaxy properties.
fesc(Lya) correlates more strongly with fesc(UV) than with fesc(Ion). In addition, we find a relation
between the emergent Lya luminosity and the ionizing photon emissivity of Lyman Alpha Emitters
(LAEs). By combining this relation with the observed luminosity functions of LAEs at different
redshift, we estimate the contribution from LAEs to the reionization of intergalactic medium (IGM).
Our result suggests that ionizing photons from LAEs alone are not sufficient to ionize IGM at z >
6, but they can maintain the ionization of IGM at z ~ 0 - 5.
