Supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs) are a sub-class of supergiant high mass X-ray binaries
hosting a neutron star accreting from the stellar wind of a massive OB companion. Compared to the
classical systems, SFXTs display a pronounced variability in X-rays that has long been (at least
partly) ascribed to the presence of clumps in the stellar wind. We report here on the first set of results
of an on-going XMM-Newton observational program aimed at searching for spectroscopic variability
during the X-ray flares and outbursts of the SFXTs. The goal of the paper is to present the observational
program and show that the obtained results are according to expectations, with a number of flares
(between one and four) generally observed per source and per observation (20~ks-long, on average).
We base our work on a systematic and uniform analysis method optimized to consistently search for
spectral signatures of a variable absorption column density, as well as other parameters of the
spectral continuum. Our preliminary results show that the program is successful and the outcomes
of the analysis support previous findings that most of the X-ray flares seem associated to the presence
of a massive structure approaching and getting accreted by the compact object. However, we cannot
rule out that other mechanisms are at work together with clumps to enhance the X-ray variability
of SFXTs. This is expected according to current theoretical models. The success of these observations
shows that our observational program can be a powerful instrument to deepen our understanding of
the X-ray variability in SFXTs. Further observations will help us in achieving a statistically
robust sample. This is required to conduct, in the future, a systematic analysis on the whole SFXT
class with the ultimate goal of disentangling the role of different mechanisms giving rise to these
events.
