We present adaptive-optics assisted near-infrared high-spectral resolution observations of
late-type giants in the nuclear star cluster of the Milky Way. The metallicity and elemental abundance
measurements of these stars offer us an opportunity to understand the formation and evolution of
the nuclear star cluster. In addition, their proximity to the supermassive black hole ($\sim 0.5$
pc) offers a unique probe of the star formation and chemical enrichment in this extreme environment.
We observed two stars identified by medium spectral-resolution observations as potentially having
very high metallicities. We use spectral-template fitting with the PHOENIX grid and Bayesian inference
to simultaneously constrain the overall metallicity, [M/H], alpha-element abundance [$\alpha$/Fe],
effective temperature, and surface gravity of these stars. We find that one of the stars has very
high metallicity ([M/H] $> 0.6$) and the other is slightly above solar metallicity. Both Galactic
center stars have lines from scandium (Sc), vanadium (V), and yttrium (Y) that are much stronger
than allowed by the PHOENIX grid. We find, using the spectral synthesis code Spectroscopy Made Easy,
that [Sc/Fe] may be an order of magnitude above solar. For comparison, we also observed an empirical
calibrator in NGC6791, the highest metallicity cluster known ([M/H] $\sim 0.4$). Most lines are
well matched between the calibrator and the Galactic center stars, except for Sc, V, and Y, which
confirms that their abundances must be anomalously high in these stars. These unusual abundances,
which may be a unique signature of nuclear star clusters, offer an opportunity to test models of chemical
enrichment in this region.
