We investigate galaxy conformity using the {\sc Mufasa}\ cosmological hydrodynamical simulation,
which uses a heuristic halo mass-based prescription to quench central galaxies. We show that satellite
galaxies are broadly consistent with observations, showing a bimodal distribution in colour with
radius, albeit with too many low-mass quenched satellites. In {\sc Mufasa}, galaxy conformity
is evident in previously observed properties such as colour, specific star formation rate, and
{\sc Hi}\ content, as well as in environment, stellar age, H$_2$ content, and metallicity. We introduce
quantifying conformity using a new measure ${\cal S}(R)$, and show that low-mass haloes have weak
conformity extending to large projected radii $R$ in all properties, while high-mass haloes have
strong conformity that diminishes rapidly with $R$ and disappears at $R\ga 1$~Mpc. ${\cal S}(R)$
is strongest for environment in low-mass haloes, and sSFR (or colour) in high-mass haloes, and is
dominated by one-halo conformity with the exception of {\sc Mufasa}\ in small haloes. Metallicity
shows a curious anti-conformity in massive haloes. Tracking the evolution of conformity for $z=0$
galaxies back in time shows that conformity generally emerges as a late-time phenomenon. However,
for fixed halo mass bins, conformity is fairly constant with redshift out to $z\ga 2$. These trends
are consistent with the idea that strong conformity only emerges once haloes grow above {\sc Mufasa}'s
quenching mass scale of $\sim 10^{12}M_\odot$. A quantitative measure of conformity in various
properties, along with its evolution, thus represents a new and stringent test of the impact of quenching
on environment within current galaxy formation models.
