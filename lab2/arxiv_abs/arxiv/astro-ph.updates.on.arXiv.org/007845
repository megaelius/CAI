We study 34 Type Ic supernovae that have broad spectral features (SNe Ic-BL). We obtained our photometric
data with the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and its continuation, the intermediate Palomar Transient
Factory (iPTF). This is the first large, homogeneous sample of SNe Ic-BL from an untargeted survey.
Furthermore, given the high cadence of (i)PTF, most of these SNe were discovered soon after explosion.
We present K-corrected $Bgriz$ light curves of these SNe, obtained through photometry on template-subtracted
images. We analyzed the shape of the $r$-band light curves, finding a correlation between the decline
parameter $\Delta m_{15}$ and the rise parameter $\Delta m_{-10}$. We studied the SN colors and,
based on $g-r$, we estimated the host-galaxy extinction. Peak $r$-band absolute magnitudes have
an average of $-18.6\pm0.5$ mag. We fit each $r$-band light curve with that of SN 1998bw (scaled and
stretched) to derive the explosion epochs. We computed the bolometric light curves using bolometric
corrections, $r$-band data, and $g-r$ colors. Expansion velocities from Fe II were obtained by
fitting spectral templates of SNe Ic. Bolometric light curves and velocities at peak were fitted
using the semianalytic Arnett model to estimate ejecta mass $M_{\rm ej}$, explosion energy $E_{K}$
and $^{56}$Ni mass $M(^{56}$Ni). We find average values of $M_{\rm ej} = 4\pm3~{\rm M}_{\odot}$,
$E_{K} = (7\pm6) \times 10^{51}~$erg, and $M(^{56}$Ni) $= 0.31\pm0.16~{\rm M}_{\odot}$. We also
estimated the degree of $^{56}$Ni mixing using scaling relations derived from hydrodynamical
models and we find that all the SNe are strongly mixed. The derived explosion parameters imply that
at least 21% of the progenitors of SNe Ic-BL are compatible with massive ($>28~{\rm M}_{\odot}$),
possibly single stars, whereas at least 64% might come from less massive stars in close binary systems.
