Metal-poor components of dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way could be remnants of the building blocks
of the Galactic halo structure. Low-mass stars that are currently observed as metal-poor stars
are expected to have formed in chemically homogeneous clusters in the early phases of galaxy formation.
They should have already disintegrated and should exhibit large scatter in abundance ratios of
some sets of elements (e.g., Sr/Ba) in the Milky Way field stars. However, chemical abundance ratios
are expected to cluster in very metal-poor stars in dwarf galaxies because the number of clusters
formed in individual galaxies in the very early phase is expected to be quite limited. We examine
the possible clustering of abundance ratios of Sr and Ba in the Sextans dwarf galaxy to test for the
clustering star formation scenario. We investigate a total of 11 elements (C, Mg, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr,
Mn, Ni, Zn, Sr, Ba) in five stars in the Sextans dwarf galaxy. Previous studies suggest that these
have similar abundance ratios. In this study, we focus on the abundance ratio of Sr to Ba. The observations
are based on high-resolution spectroscopy (R = 40 000) using the Subaru Telescope High Dispersion
Spectrograph. The distribution of $\alpha$/Fe abundance ratios of the Sextans dwarf galaxy stars
is slightly lower than the average of the values of stars in the Galactic halo. The Sr/Ba abundance
ratios for the five metal-poor stars are in good agreement, and this clumping is distinctive compared
to the [Sr/Ba] spread seen in the metal-poor halo stars. We find that the probability of such clumping
is very small if the Sextans stars have distributions of Sr and Ba abundances similar to halo stars.
