We estimate the neutrino emission from the decay chain of the $\pi$-meson and $\mu$-lepton, produced
by proton-proton inelastic scattering in energetic ($E_{\rm iso}\gtrsim 10^{52}$ erg) long gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs), within the type I binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) model. The BdHN I progenitor is
binary system composed of a carbon-oxygen star (CO$_{\rm core}$) and a neutron star (NS) companion.
The CO$_{\rm core}$ explosion as supernova (SN) triggers a massive accretion process onto the NS.
For short orbital periods of few minutes, the NS reaches the critical mass, hence forming a black
hole (BH). Recent numerical simulations of the above scenario show that the SN ejecta becomes highly
asymmetric, creating a \textit{cavity} around the newborn BH site, due to the NS accretion and gravitational
collapse. Therefore, the electron-positron ($e^{\pm}$) plasma created in the BH formation, during
its isotropic and expanding self-acceleration, engulfs different amounts of ejecta baryons along
different directions, leading to a direction-dependent Lorentz factor. The protons engulfed
inside the high-density ($\sim10^{23}$~particle/cm$^3$) ejecta reach energies in the range
$1.24\lesssim E_p\lesssim 6.14$ GeV and interact with the unshocked protons in the ejecta. The
protons engulfed from the low density region around the BH reach energies $\sim 1$ TeV and interact
with the low-density ($\sim1$~particle/cm$^3$) protons of the interstellar medium (ISM). The
above interactions give rise, respectively, to neutrino energies $E_{\nu}\leq 2$ GeV and $10\leq
E_{\nu}\leq 10^3$ GeV, and for both cases we calculate the spectra and luminosity.
