Galactic cosmic-ray source compositions (Z/H)GCRS, measured from H to Pb and ~10^8-10^14 eV, differ
greatly compared to solar system (Z/H)SS by factors of ~20-200. Yet these two compositions are drawn
from essentially the same core collapse (CCSN) and thermonuclear (SN Ia) supernova ejecta: (Z/H)SS
from unbiased accumulation over ~Gyr and (Z/H)GCRS from highly biased sampling during the brief
period <30 kyr of homologous early Sedov-Taylor supernova expansion that diffusive shock acceleration
(DSA) is most effective. These differences reveal how (Z/H)GCRS can result from just two self-consistent
processes: ubiquitous mass mixing (Z/H)SS/(Z/H)CCSN ~4 of shocked, swept-up interstellar medium
with high metallicity, core collapse supernova ejecta forming a base; and selective grain injection
of refractory elements first condensed FGC as fast grains in freely expanding ejecta, then Coulomb-sputtered
FCS by H and He as suprathermal ions into supernova shocks, where DSA carries them to cosmic-ray energies.
This bulk mixing selectively increases source mix abundances (Z/H)SM /(Z/H)SS by ~2-10; and injection
by grain condensation fractions FGC, from meteoritic chondrules, further enhances by ~6, while
elemental-charge Z^2/3-Coulomb grain sputtering and scattering yields FCS give added enrichment
of ~4-20. Applying these basic processes of mixing and injection to solar system (chondrule) abundances
(Z/H)SS produces grain-injected, source-mix (Z/H)SMGI that match major cosmic-ray abundances
(Z/H)GCRS to 1+-35% with no free parameters. Independently confirming the power of grain injection,
(Z/H)GCRS shows no detectable contribution of Fe from SN Ia, which produce ~1/2 Fe in ISM, which is
quite consistent with no dust in SN Ia remnants, unlike CCSN.
