We introduce a new suite of simulations, "The Cloud Factory", which self-consistently forms molecular
cloud complexes at high enough resolution to resolve internal substructure (up to 0.25 Msol in mass)
all while including galactic-scale forces. We use a version of the Arepo code modified to include
a detailed treatment of the physics of the cold molecular ISM, and an analytical galactic gravitational
potential for computational efficiency. The simulations have nested levels of resolution, with
the lowest layer tied to tracer particles injected into individual cloud complexes. These tracer
refinement regions are embedded in the larger simulation so continue to experience forces from
outside the cloud. This allows the simulations to act as a laboratory for testing the effect of galactic
environment on star formation. Here we introduce our method and investigate the effect of galactic
environment on filamentary clouds. We find that cloud complexes formed after a clustered burst
of feedback, have shorter lengths and are less likely to fragment compared to quiescent clouds (e.g.
the Musca filament) or those dominated by the galactic potential (e.g. Nessie). Spiral arms and
differential rotation preferentially align filaments, but strong feedback randomises them.
Long filaments formed within the cloud complexes are necessarily coherent with low internal velocity
gradients, which has implications for the formation of filamentary star-clusters. Cloud complexes
formed in regions dominated by supernova feedback have fewer star-forming cores, and these are
more widely distributed. These differences show galactic-scale forces can have a significant
impact on star formation within molecular clouds.
