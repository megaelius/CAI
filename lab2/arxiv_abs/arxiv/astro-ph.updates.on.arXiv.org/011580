This paper deals with the rotation and figure evolution of a planet near the 3/2 spin-orbit resonance
and the exploration of a new formulation of the creep tide theory (Folonier et al. 2018). This new
formulation is composed by a system of differential equations for the figure and the rotation of
the body simultaneously (which is the same system of equations used in Folonier et al. 2018), different
from the original one (Ferraz-Mello, 2013, 2015a) in which rotation and figure were considered
separately. The time evolution of the figure of the body is studied for both the 3/2 and 2/1 spin-orbit
resonances. Moreover, we provide a method to determine the relaxation factor gamma of non-rigid
homogeneous bodies whose endpoint of rotational evolution from tidal interactions is the 3/2 spin-orbit
resonance, provided that (i) an initially faster rotation is assumed and (ii) no permanent components
of the flattenings of the body existed at the time of the capture in the 3/2 spin-orbit resonance.
The method is applied to Mercury, since it is currently trapped in a 3/2 spin-orbit resonance with
its orbital motion and we obtain 4.8 times 10 -8 s -1 lower than gamma lower than 4.8 times 10 -9 s -1 .
The equatorial prolateness and polar oblateness coefficients obtained for Mercury's figure with
such range of values of gamma are the same as the ones given by the Darwin-Kaula model (Matsuyama and
Nimmo 2009). However, comparing the values of the flattenings obtained for such range of gamma with
those obtained from MESSENGER's measurements (Perry et al. 2015), we see that the current values
for Mercury's equatorial prolateness and polar oblateness are 2-3 orders of magnitude larger than
the values given by the tidal theories.
