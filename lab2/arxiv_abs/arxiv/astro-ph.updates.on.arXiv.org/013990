The advent of a new generation of large-scale galaxy surveys is pushing cosmological numerical
simulations in an uncharted territory. The simultaneous requirements of high resolution and very
large volume pose serious technical challenges, due to their computational and data storage demand.
In this paper, we present a novel approach dubbed Dynamic Zoom Simulations -- or DZS -- developed
to tackle these issues. Our method is tailored to the production of lightcone outputs from N-body
numerical simulations, which allow for a more efficient storage and post-processing compared
to standard comoving snapshots, and more directly mimic the format of survey data. In DZS, the resolution
of the simulation is dynamically decreased outside the lightcone surface, reducing the computational
work load, while simultaneously preserving the accuracy inside the lightcone and the large-scale
gravitational field. We show that our approach can achieve virtually identical results to traditional
simulations at half of the computational cost for our largest box. We also forecast this speedup
to increase up to a factor of 5 for larger and/or higher-resolution simulations. We assess the accuracy
of the numerical integration by comparing pairs of identical simulations run with and without DZS.
Deviations in the lightcone halo mass function, in the sky-projected lightcone, and in the 3D matter
lightcone always remain below 0.1%. In summary, our results indicate that the DZS technique may
provide a highly-valuable tool to address the technical challenges that will characterise the
next generation of large-scale cosmological simulations.
