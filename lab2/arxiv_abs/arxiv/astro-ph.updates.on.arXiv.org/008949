Understanding the collapse of clouds and the formation of protoplanetary disks is essential to
understanding the formation of stars and planets. Infall and accretion, the mass-aggregation
processes that occur at envelope and disk scales, drive the dynamical evolution of protostars.
While the observations of protostars at different stages constrain their evolutionary tracks,
the impact of variability due to accretion bursts on dynamical and chemical evolution of the source
is largely unknown. The lasting effects on protostellar envelopes and disks are tracked through
multi-wavelength and time domain observational campaigns, requiring deep X-ray, infrared, and
radio imaging and spectroscopy, at a sufficient level of spatial detail to distinguish contributions
from the various substructures (i.e., envelope from disk from star from outflow). Protostellar
models derived from these campaigns will illuminate the initial chemical state of protoplanetary
disks during the epoch of giant planet formation. Insight from individual star formation in the
Milky Way is also necessary to understand star formation rates in extragalactic sources. This cannot
be achieved with ground-based observatories and is not covered by currently approved instrumentation.
Requirements: High (v < 10 km/s for survey; v < 1 km/s for followup) spectral resolution capabilities
with relatively rapid response times in the IR (3-500 um), X-ray (0.1-10 keV), and radio (cm) are
critical to follow the course of accretion and outflow during an outburst. Complementary, AU-scale
radio observations are needed to probe the disk accretion zone, and 10 AU-scale to probe chemical
and kinematic structures of the disk-forming regions, and track changes in the dust, ice, and gas
within protostellar envelopes.
