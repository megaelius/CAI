Proxima Centauri is known to host an earth-like planet in its habitable zone; very recently a second
candidate planet was proposed based on radial velocities. At quadrature, the expected projected
separation of this new candidate is larger than 1 arcsec, making it a potentially interesting target
for direct imaging. While difficult, identification of the optical counterpart of this planet
would allow detailed characterization of the closest planetary system. We searched for a counterpart
in SPHERE images acquired during four years through the SHINE survey. In order to account for the
large orbital motion of the planet, we used a method that assumes the circular orbit obtained from
radial velocities and exploits the sequence of observations acquired close to quadrature in the
orbit. We checked this with a more general approach that considers keplerian motion, K-stacker.
We did not obtain a clear detection. The best candidate has S/N=6.1 in the combined image. A statistical
test suggests that the probability that this detection is due to random fluctuation of noise is <
1% but this result depends on the assumption that distribution of noise is uniform over the image.
The position of this candidate and the orientation of its orbital plane fit well with observations
in the ALMA 12m array image. However, the astrometric signal expected from the orbit of the candidate
we detected is 3-sigma away from the astrometric motion of Proxima as measured from early Gaia data.
This, together with the unexpectedly high flux associated with our direct imaging detection, means
we cannot confirm that our candidate is indeed Proxima c. On the other hand, if confirmed, this would
be the first observation in imaging of a planet discovered from radial velocities and the second
one (after Fomalhaut b) of reflecting circumplanetary material. Further confirmation observations
should be done as soon as possible.
