The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec instrument will allow rest-frame ultraviolet and
optical spectroscopy for large numbers of galaxies in the epoch of reionization (EoR). Some of these
galaxies may exhibit significant leakage of hydrogen-ionizing photons into the intergalactic
medium, which is expected to result in fainter nebular emission lines from these objects. Here we
present a machine learning framework for identifying cases of very high hydrogen-ionizing (Lyman
continuum) photon escape from galaxies based on the data quality expected from potential NIRSpec
observations of EoR galaxies in lensed fields. We train our algorithm on mock samples of JWST/NIRSpec
data for galaxies at redshifts $z=6$--10, by combining synthetic galaxy spectra based on cosmological
galaxy simulations with observational noise relevant for $z\gtrsim 6$ objects of a brightness
similar to EoR galaxy candidates uncovered in Frontier Fields observations of galaxy cluster Abell-2744
and MACS-J0416. Under the assumption that the simulations provide sufficiently realistic representations
of actual EoR galaxies, we find that ionizing escape fractions of galaxies brighter than $m_\mathrm{AB,1500}
\approx 27$ mag may be retrieved with mean absolute error $\Delta f_\mathrm{esc}\approx$ 0.07
(0.11) for 10 h (1.5 h) JWST/NIRSpec exposures at resolution $R=100$. In the case of 10 h exposures,
even fainter galaxies ($m_\mathrm{AB,1500} < 28.5$ mag) can be processed with $\Delta f_\mathrm{esc}\approx$
0.12. This framework also simultaneously estimates the redshift of these galaxies with a relative
error less than $0.03$ for both 10 h ($m_\mathrm{AB,1500} < 28.5$ mag) and 1.5 h ($m_\mathrm{AB,1500}
< 27$ mag) exposure times.
