The nature of Type II Cepheids and Anomalous Cepheids is still not well known and their evolutionary
channels leave many unanswered questions. One of the characteristic features directly related
to the age of stars is their spatial distribution. We use complete collection of classical pulsating
stars in the Magellanic Clouds discovered by the OGLE project, to compare their spatial distributions.
In this analysis we use 9649 Classical Cepheids (DCEPs), 262 Anomalous Cepheids (ACEPs), 338 Type
II Cepheids (T2CEPs) and 46 443 RR Lyrae stars (RR Lyr) from both Magellanic Clouds. We compute three-dimensional
Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for every possible pair of T2CEPs and ACEPs with DCEPs, and RR Lyr stars.
We confirm that BL Her stars are as old as RR Lyr variables - their spatial distributions are similar,
and they create a vast halo around both galaxies. We discover that spatial distribution of W Vir stars
has attributes characteristic for both young and old stellar populations. Hence, it seems that
these similarities are related to the concentration of these stars in the center of the Large Magellanic
Cloud, and the lack of a vast halo. This leads to the conclusion that W Vir variables could be a mixture
of old and intermediate-age stars. Our analysis of the three-dimensional distributions of ACEPs
shows that they differ significantly from DCEPs. Statistical tests of ACEPs distributions with
RR Lyr distributions give ambiguous results. We consider that these two distributions can be similar
through the vast halos they create. This similarity would confirm ACEPs evolution scenario that
assumes coalescence of a binary system.
