We present spectroscopic confirmation of five galaxy clusters at $1.25 < \textit{z} < 1.5$, discovered
in the $2500$ deg$^{2}$ South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SPT-SZ) survey. These clusters,
taken from a mass-limited sample with a nearly redshift independent selection function, have multi-wavelength
follow-up imaging data from the X-ray to near-infrared, and currently form the most homogeneous
massive high-redshift cluster sample known. We identify $44$ member galaxies, along with $25$
field galaxies, among the five clusters, and describe the full set of observations and data products
from Magellan/LDSS3 multi-object spectroscopy of these cluster fields. We briefly describe the
analysis pipeline, and present ensemble analyses of cluster member galaxies that demonstrate
the reliability of the measured redshifts. We report $\textit{z} = 1.259, 1.288, 1.316, 1.401$
and $1.474$ for the five clusters from a combination of absorption-line (Ca II H$\&$K doublet - $3968,3934$
{\AA}) and emission-line ([OII] $3727,3729$ {\AA}) spectral features. Moreover, the calculated
velocity dispersions yield dynamical cluster masses in good agreement with SZ masses for these
clusters. We discuss the velocity and spatial distributions of passive and [OII]-emitting galaxies
in these clusters, showing that they are consistent with velocity segregation and biases observed
in lower redshift SPT clusters. We identify modest [OII] emission and pronounced CN and H$\delta$
absorption in a stacked spectrum of $28$ passive galaxies with Ca II H$\&$K-derived redshifts.
This work increases the number of spectroscopically-confirmed SZ-selected galaxy clusters at
$\textit{z} > 1.25$ from three to eight, further demonstrating the efficacy of SZ selection for
the highest redshift massive clusters, and enabling detailed study of these systems.
