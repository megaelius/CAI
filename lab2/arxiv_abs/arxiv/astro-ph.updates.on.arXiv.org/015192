Massive stars are important metal factories in the Universe. They have short and energetic lives,
and many of them inevitably explode as a supernova and become a neutron star or black hole. In turn,
the formation, evolution and explosive deaths of massive stars impact the surrounding interstellar
medium and shape the evolution of their host galaxies. Yet the chemical and dynamical evolution
of a massive star, including the chemical yield of the ultimate supernova and the remnant mass of
the compact object, strongly depend on the interior physics of the progenitor star. We currently
lack empirically calibrated prescriptions for various physical processes at work within massive
stars, but this is now being remedied by asteroseismology. The study of stellar structure and evolution
using stellar oscillations - asteroseismology - has undergone a revolution in the last two decades
thanks to high-precision time series photometry from space telescopes. In particular, the long-term
light curves provided by the MOST, CoRoT, BRITE, Kepler/K2 and TESS missions provided invaluable
data sets in terms of photometric precision, duration and frequency resolution to successfully
apply asteroseismology to massive stars and probe their interior physics. The observation and
subsequent modelling of stellar pulsations in massive stars has revealed key missing ingredients
in stellar structure and evolution models of these stars. Thus asteroseismology has opened a new
window into calibrating stellar physics within a highly degenerate part of the Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram. In this review, I provide a historical overview of the progress made using ground-based
and early space missions, and discuss more recent advances and breakthroughs in our understanding
of massive star interiors by means of asteroseismology with modern space telescopes.
