Many stars form in regions of enhanced stellar density, wherein the influence of stellar neighbours
can have a strong influence on a protoplanetary disc (PPD) population. In particular, far ultraviolet
(FUV) flux from massive stars drives thermal winds from the outer edge of PPDs, accelerating disc
destruction. In this work, we present a novel technique for constraining the dynamical history
of a star forming environment using PPD properties in a strongly FUV irradiated environment. Applying
recent models for FUV induced mass loss rates to the PPD population of Cygnus OB2, we constrain how
long ago primordial gas was expelled from the region; $ 0.5$ Myr ago if the Shakura & Sunyaev $\alpha$-viscosity
parameter is $\alpha = 10^{-2}$ (corresponding to a viscous timescale of $\tau_\mathrm{visc}
\approx 0.5$ Myr for a disc of scale radius $40$ au around a $1\, M_\odot$ star). This value of $\alpha$
is effectively an upper limit, since it assumes efficient extinction of FUV photons throughout
the embedded phase. With this gas expulsion timescale we are able to produce a full dynamical model
that fits kinematic and morphological data as well as disc fractions. We suggest Cygnus OB2 was originally
composed of distinct massive clumps or filaments, each with a stellar mass $\sim 10^4 \, M_\odot$.
Finally we predict that in regions of efficient FUV induced mass loss, disc mass $M_\mathrm{disc}$
as a function of stellar host mass $m_\mathrm{star}$ follows a power law with $M_\mathrm{disc}
\propto m_\mathrm{star}^\beta$, where $\beta \gtrsim 2.7$ (depending on disc initial conditions
and FUV exposure). This is steeper than observed correlations in regions of moderate FUV flux ($1
< \beta <1.9$), and offers a promising diagnostic to establish the influence of external photoevaporation
in a given region.
