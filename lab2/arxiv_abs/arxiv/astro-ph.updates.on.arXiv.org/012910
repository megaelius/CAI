Classification of matter through topological phases and topological edge states between distinct
materials has been a subject of great interest recently. While lattices have been the main setting
for these studies, a relatively unexplored realm for this physics is that of continuum fluids. In
the typical case of a fluid model with a point spectrum, nontrivial topology and associated edge
modes have been observed previously. However, another possibility is that a continuous spectrum
can conexist with the point spectrum. Here we demonstrate that a fluid plasma model can harbor nontrivial
topology within its continuous spectrum, and that there are boundary modes at the interface between
topologically distinct regions. We consider the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model. In the
presence of magnetic shear, we find nontrivial topology in the {\Alfven} continuum. For strong
shear, the Chern number is $\pm 1$, depending on the sign of the shear. If the magnetic shear changes
sign within the plasma, a topological phase transition occurs, and bulk-boundary correspondence
then suggests a mode localized to the layer of zero magnetic shear. We confirm the existence of this
mode numerically. Moreover, this reversed-shear {\Alfven} eigenmode (RSAE) is well known within
the magnetic fusion community as it has been observed in several tokamaks. A potential implication
of our findings is that the RSAE may be topologically robust to three-dimensional perturbations
such as magnetic islands. Moreover, this work raises the broader possibility that fusion devices
could be carefully tailored to produce other topological states and potentially useful behavior.
In considering how the MHD model might be regularized at small scales, we also consider the electron
limit of Hall MHD. We show that the whistler band, which plays an important role in planetary ionospheres,
has nontrivial topology.
