Combining archival Chandra X-ray Observatory and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) observations
of the nearby cluster Abell 1795, we have compiled a sample of 61 massive (M_star > 10^10 M_sun) cluster
members spanning 0.25 < R/R_500 < 2.5 that have five bands of SDSS coverage and were observed within
5 arcmin of the Chandra optical axis in at least one observation. The Abell 1795 cluster members have
been separated into two coarse clustercentric radius bins: 0.25 < R/R_500 < 1 and 1 < R/R_500 < 2.5.
X-ray images at 0.5-1.5 keV for each member were created and then stacked in the two radial bins. We
have defined a model that accounts for the dominant X-ray emission expected in and around cluster
galaxies: the intracluster medium (ICM), low- and high-mass X-ray binaries, active galactic nuclei,
and hot gas halos. Surface brightness profiles of inner and outer cluster galaxies are simultaneously
fit in order to inform the initial state of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. The MCMC code
emcee is used to derive the best fit between the data and the model, and generate 25 million sets of
model parameters, which we use to measure the 0.5-1.5 keV luminosities of each model component.
Leveraging effective total Chandra exposure times of 3.3 and 2.1 Msec at 0.25 < R/R_500 < 1 and 1 < R/R_500
< 2.5, respectively, we have detected hot gas halos, in a statistical sense, around Abell 1795 cluster
members. Galaxies at 1 < R/R_500 < 2.5 have 0.5-1.5 keV hot halo luminosities of log(L_X/(erg/s))=39.9+/-0.2,
an order of magnitude larger than galaxies in the inner cluster (log(L_X/(erg/s))=38.6(+0.6)(-0.7)).
This result suggests that the ICM is removing hot gas from the halos of Abell 1795 members as they fall
into the cluster, which is strong evidence for ongoing quenching by strangulation.
