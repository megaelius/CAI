We observed dynamically new sungrazing comet ISON (C/2012 S1) extensively at Lowell Observatory
throughout 2013 in order to characterize its behavior prior to perihelion. ISON had "typical" abundances
for an Oort Cloud comet. Its dust production, as measured by Afrho, remained nearly constant during
the apparition but its CN gas production increased by ~50x. The minimum active area necessary to
support observed water production rates exceeded the likely surface area of the nucleus and suggests
a population of icy grains in the coma. Together with the flattening of the dust radial profile over
time, this is consistent with ejection of a large quantity of slow moving dust and icy grains in the
coma at large heliocentric distance. The dust morphology was dominated by the tail, but a faint sunward
dust fan was detected in March, April, May, and September. We imaged multiple gas species in September,
October, and November. Excess CN signal was observed in the sunward hemisphere in September and
early October. In November the excess CN signal was in the tailward hemisphere and two faint CN features
appeared approximately orthogonal to the tail with position angles varying by about +/-20 degrees
from night to night. Using numerical modeling, we best reproduced the orientation and shape of these
features as well as the bulk brightness with a pole oriented approximately towards the Sun and a single
source located within ~35 degrees of the equator. The production rates and coma morphology suggest
a nucleus that was active over nearly its entire sunward facing hemisphere in September and October
but which underwent a significant mass loss event, potentially including fragmentation, shortly
before November 1. Significant mass loss likely continued at the same site over subsequent days/weeks
and may have catastrophically weakened the nucleus prior to perihelion.
