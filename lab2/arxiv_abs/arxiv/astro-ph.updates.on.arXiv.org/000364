We perform a meta-study of recently published Redshift Space Distortion (RSD) measurements of
the cosmological growth rate, f(z)\sigma_8(z). We analyse the latest results from the 6dFGS, BOSS,
LRG, WiggleZ and VIPERS galaxy redshift surveys, and compare the measurements to expectations
from Planck. In this Letter we point out that the RSD measurements are consistently less than the
values expected from Planck, and the relative scatter between the RSD measurements is lower than
expected. Adopting the equation-of-state of dark energy, w, as a strawman for comparison purposes,
we obtain a best-fit value of w=-0.74\pm0.07 from a joint fit to all recent measurements, in tension
with the \LambdaCDM value of w=-1 at greater than the three standard deviation level. However, the
\chi^2 of the resulting fit is 2.70 for 8 degrees of freedom, corresponding to a probability-to-exceed
(PTE) of 0.952. On fitting for \sigma_8, we find \sigma_8=.722\pm0.038, \chi^2=2.91 and PTE=0.940.
Further, a simple constant in redshift for f(z)\sigma_8(z) provides an even better fit, with \chi^2=2.09
for a PTE of 0.978. On changing the LRG results to an analysis with a longer maximum correlation scale,
we find w=-0.78\pm0.07, \chi^2=4.01, and PTE=0.856, a best fit constant value of 0.425\pm0.04,
\chi^2=3.71, and PTE=0.883, or \sigma_8=.741\pm0.034, \chi^2=4.05 and PTE=0.852. A full resolution
of this issue may require a more robust treatment of non-linear effects in RSD models, although the
trend for a low \sigma_8 agrees with recent constraints on \sigma_8 and \Omega_m from Sunyaev-Zeldovich
cluster counts identified in Planck.
