Because the solar luminosity increases over geological timescales, Earth climate is expected
to warm, increasing water evaporation which, in turn, enhances the atmospheric greenhouse effect.
Above a certain critical insolation, this destabilizing greenhouse feedback can "runaway" until
all the oceans are evaporated. Through increases in stratospheric humidity, warming may also cause
oceans to escape to space before the runaway greenhouse occurs. The critical insolation thresholds
for these processes, however, remain uncertain because they have so far been evaluated with unidimensional
models that cannot account for the dynamical and cloud feedback effects that are key stabilizing
features of Earth's climate. Here we use a 3D global climate model to show that the threshold for the
runaway greenhouse is about 375 W/m$^2$, significantly higher than previously thought. Our model
is specifically developed to quantify the climate response of Earth-like planets to increased
insolation in hot and extremely moist atmospheres. In contrast with previous studies, we find that
clouds have a destabilizing feedback on the long term warming. However, subsident, unsaturated
regions created by the Hadley circulation have a stabilizing effect that is strong enough to defer
the runaway greenhouse limit to higher insolation than inferred from 1D models. Furthermore, because
of wavelength-dependent radiative effects, the stratosphere remains cold and dry enough to hamper
atmospheric water escape, even at large fluxes. This has strong implications for Venus early water
history and extends the size of the habitable zone around other stars.
