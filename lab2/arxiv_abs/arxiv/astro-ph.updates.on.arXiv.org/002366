We present a dynamical model describing how halo particles can receive a significant energy kick
from the merger between their own host halo and a target halo. This is highly relevant for understanding
the growth of cosmological halos, and could especially provide an explanation for some high velocity
objects. The model we present includes a \emph{double scattering mechanism}, where a halo particle
is given a significant energy kick by undergoing two subsequent gravitational deflections during
the merger. The first deflection is by the potential of the target halo, whereas the second is by the
potential of the particle's original host halo. The resultant energy kick arises because the two
halos move relative to each other during the two deflections. To our knowledge, this mechanism has
never been characterized in this context before. We derive analytically a halo particle's total
kick energy, which is composed of energy from the double scattering mechanism and energy release
from tidal fields, as a function of its position in its original host halo. In the case of a $1:10$ merger
between two Hernquist halos, we estimate that the presented mechanisms can generate particles
with a velocity $\sim 2$ times the virial velocity of the target halo measured at its virial sphere.
This motivates us to suggest that the high velocity of the recently discovered globular cluster
HVCG-1 \citep{2014ApJ...787L..11C} can be explained by a head-on halo merger. Finally, we illustrate
the orbital evolution of particles outside the virial sphere of the target halo, by solving the equation
of motion in an expanding universe. We find a 'sweet spot' around a scale factor of $0.3-0.5$ for ejecting
particles into large orbits, which easily can reach beyond $\sim 5$ virial radii.
