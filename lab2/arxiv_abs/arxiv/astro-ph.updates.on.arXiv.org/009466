Strong solar flares and coronal mass ejections, here defined not only as the bursts of electromagnetic
radiation but as the entire process in which magnetic energy is released through magnetic reconnection
and plasma instability, emanate from active regions (ARs) in which high magnetic non-potentiality
resides in a wide variety of forms. This review focuses on the formation and evolution of flare-productive
ARs from both observational and theoretical points of view. Starting from a general introduction
of the genesis of ARs and solar flares, we give an overview of the key observational features during
the long-term evolution in the pre-flare state, the rapid changes in the magnetic field associated
with the flare occurrence, and the physical mechanisms behind these phenomena. Our picture of flare-productive
ARs is summarized as follows: subject to the turbulent convection, the rising magnetic flux in the
interior deforms into a complex structure and gains high non-potentiality; as the flux appears
on the surface, an AR with large free magnetic energy and helicity is built, which is represented
by delta-sunspots, sheared polarity inversion lines, magnetic flux ropes, etc; the flare occurs
when sufficient magnetic energy has accumulated, and the drastic coronal evolution affects magnetic
fields even in the photosphere. We show that the improvement of observational instruments and modeling
capabilities has significantly advanced our understanding in the last decades. Finally, we discuss
the outstanding issues and future perspective and further broaden our scope to the possible applications
of our knowledge to space-weather forecasting, extreme events in history, and corresponding stellar
activities.
