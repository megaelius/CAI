Protoplanets and circumplanetary disks are rather elusive in their thermal IR emission. Yet they
are cornerstone to the most popular interpretations for the protoplanetary disks structures observed
in the gas and dust density fields, even though alternative theories exist. The gaseous velocity
field should also bear the imprint of planet-disk interactions, with non-Keplerian fine structure
in the molecular line channel maps. Such kinks or wiggles are affected by the optical depth structure
and synthesis imaging limitations, but their detail could in principle be connected to the perturber
by comparison with hydrodynamical simulations. These predictions appear to have been observed
in HD163296 and HD97048, where the most conspicuous wiggles are interpreted in terms of embedded
planets. The velocity centroid maps may allow for more robust indirect detections of embedded planets.
The non-Keplerian velocity along the planetary wakes undergoes an abrupt sign reversal across
the protoplanet. After subtraction of the disk rotation curve, the location of the perturber should
be identifiable as a Doppler-flip in velocity centroid maps. Here we improve our rotation curves
in an extension to disks with intermediate inclinations, which we apply to deep and fine angular
resolution CO isotopologue datasets. Trials in HD163296 and in HD97048 yield non-detections.
However, in HD100546 we pick-up a conspicuous Doppler-flip, an important part of which is likely
due to radial flows. Its coincidence with a fine ridge crossing an annular groove inside the continuum
ring suggests a complex dynamical scenario, in which the putative protoplanet might have recently
undergone pebble accretion.
