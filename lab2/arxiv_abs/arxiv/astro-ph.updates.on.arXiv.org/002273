In a previous paper [M. E. Gusakov, A. I. Chugunov, and E. M. Kantor, Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 151101 (2014)],
we introduced a new scenario that explains the existence of rapidly rotating warm neutron stars
(NSs) observed in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). Here it is described in more detail. The scenario
takes into account the interaction between superfluid inertial modes and the normal (quadrupole)
$m=2$ $r$-mode, which can be driven unstable by Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz (CFS) mechanism.
This interaction can only occur at some fixed "resonance" stellar temperatures; it leads to formation
of the "stability peaks" which stabilize a star in the vicinity of these temperatures. We demonstrate
that a NS in LMXB spends a substantial fraction of time on the stability peak, that is, in the region
of stellar temperatures and spin frequencies, that has been previously thought to be CFS unstable
with respect to excitation of $r$-modes. We also find that the spin frequencies of NSs are limited
by the CFS instability of normal (octupole) $m=3$ $r$-mode rather than by $m=2$ $r$-mode. This result
agrees with the predicted value of the cutoff spin frequency $\sim 730$ Hz in the spin distribution
of accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars. In addition, we analyze evolution of a NS after the end of
the accretion phase and demonstrate that millisecond pulsars can be born in LMXBs within our scenario.
Besides millisecond pulsars, our scenario also predicts a new class of LMXB descendants - hot and
rapidly rotating nonaccreting NSs ("hot widows"/HOFNARs). Further comparison of the proposed
theory with observations of rotating NSs can impose new important constraints on the properties
of superdense matter.
