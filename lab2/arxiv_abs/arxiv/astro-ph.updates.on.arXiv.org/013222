We report here time domain infrared spectroscopy and optical photometry of the HD145263 silica-rich
circumstellar disk system taken from 2003 through 2014. We find an F4V host star surrounded by a stable,
massive 1e22 - 1e23 kg (M_Moon to M_Mars) dust disk. No disk gas was detected, and the primary star
was seen rotating with a rapid ~1.75 day period. After resolving a problem with previously reported
observations, we find the silica, Mg-olivine, and Fe-pyroxene mineralogy of the dust disk to be
stable throughout, and very unusual compared to the ferromagnesian silicates typically found
in primordial and debris disks. By comparison with mid-infrared spectral features of primitive
solar system dust, we explore the possibility that HD 145263's circumstellar dust mineralogy occurred
with preferential destruction of Fe-bearing olivines, metal sulfides, and water ice in an initially
comet-like mineral mix and their replacement by Fe-bearing pyroxenes, amorphous pyroxene, and
silica. We reject models based on vaporizing optical stellar megaflares, aqueous alteration,
or giant hypervelocity impacts as unable to produce the observed mineralogy. Scenarios involving
unusually high Si abundances are at odds with the normal stellar absorption near-infrared feature
strengths for Mg, Fe, and Si. Models involving intense space weathering of a thin surface patina
via moderate (T < 1300 K) heating and energetic ion sputtering due to a stellar superflare from the
F4V primary are consistent with the observations. The space weathered patina should be reddened,
contain copious amounts of nanophase Fe, and should be transient on timescales of decades unless
replenished.
