Non-LTE analysis of the oxygen abundances for 51 Galactic A-, F- and G-type supergiants and bright
giants is performed. In contrast with carbon and nitrogen, oxygen does not show any significant
systematic anomalies in their abundances log E(O). There is no marked difference from the initial
oxygen abundance within errors of the log E(O) determination across the Teff interval from 4500
to 8500 K and the log g interval from 1.2 to 2.9 dex. This result agrees well with theoretical predictions,
which show that for AFG supergiants the log E(O) lowering is less than 0.15 dex if the initial rotational
velocities V0<300 km/s. With our new data for oxygen and our earlier non-LTE determinations of the
N and C abundances for stars from the same sample, we constructed the [N/C] vs [N/O] relation for 17
stars. This relation is known to be a sensitive indicator of stellar evolution. A pronounced correlation
between [N/C] vs [N/O] is found; the observed [N/C] increase from 0 to 1.6 dex is accompanied by the
[N/O] increase from 0 to 0.9 dex. We compared the observed [N/C] vs [N/O] relation with theoretical
predictions for stellar models with rotation. Such a comparison shows that this relation reflects
a strong dependence of the evolutionary changes in CNO abundances on the initial rotation velocities
of stars. It is found that the stars studied are mostly the post first dredge-up (post-FDU) objects
with the initial rotational velocities V0<150 km/s. It is important that just such initial velocities
V0 are typical for about 80% of stars in question (i.e. for stars with masses 4-19 M_sun). A constancy
of the total C+N+O abundance during stellar evolution is confirmed. The mean value log E(C+N+O)
= 8.97+/-0.08 found by us for AFG supergiants and bright giants seems to be very close to the initial
value 8.92 (the Sun) or 8.94 (the unevolved B-type MS stars).
