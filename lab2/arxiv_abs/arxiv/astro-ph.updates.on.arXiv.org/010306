We examine how tides, stellar evolution, and magnetic braking shape the rotation period (P$_{rot}$)
evolution of low-mass stellar binaries up to orbital periods (P$_{orb}$) of 100 d across a wide range
tidal dissipation parameters using two common equilibrium tidal models. We find that many binaries
with P$_{orb} < 20$ d tidally lock, and most with $P_{orb} < 4$ d tidally lock into synchronous rotation
on circularized orbits. At short P$_{orb}$, tidal torques produce a population of fast rotators
that single-star only models of magnetic braking fail to produce. In many cases, we show that the
competition between magnetic braking and tides produces a population of subsynchronous rotators
that persists for Gyrs, even in short P$_{orb}$ binaries, qualitatively reproducing the subsynchronous
eclipsing binaries (EBs) discovered in the Kepler field by Lurie et al. (2017). Both equilibrium
tidal models predict that binaries can tidally-interact out to P$_{orb} \approx 80$ d, while the
Constant Phase Lag tidal model predicts that binaries can tidally lock out to P$_{orb} \approx 100$
d. Tidal torques often force the P$_{rot}$ evolution of stellar binaries to depart from the long-term
magnetic braking-driven spin down experienced by single stars, revealing that P$_{rot}$ is not
be a valid proxy for age in all cases, i.e. gyrochronology can underpredict ages by up to $300\%$ unless
one accounts for binarity. We suggest that accurate determinations of orbital eccentricties and
P$_{rot}$ can be used to discriminate between which equilibrium tidal models best describes tidal
interactions in low-mass binary stars.
