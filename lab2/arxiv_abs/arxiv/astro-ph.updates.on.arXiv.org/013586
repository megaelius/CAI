We investigated the properties of AGN environments, particularly environments where the association
of luminous galaxies (LGs) is found within 4~Mpc from AGNs with redshifts of 0.8 -- 1.1. For comparison,
three additional AGN environments, (namely, AGNs of all types, type~1 AGNs with X-ray and/or radio
detection, and type~2 AGNs) and an environment of blue $M_{*}$, characteristic luminosity of the
Schechter function, galaxies were investigated. The cross-correlation function with the surrounding
galaxies was measured and compared between the AGN and blue galaxy samples. We also compared the
distributions of color, absolute magnitude, and stellar mass of the galaxies around such target
objects. The properties of clusters detected using surrounding galaxies selected based on a photometric
redshift were examined and compared for different samples. The target AGNs were drawn from the Million
Quasars (MILLIQUAS) catalog, and the blue galaxies were drawn from six redshift survey catalogs
(SDSS, WiggleZ, DEEP2, VVDS, VIPERS, and PRIMUS). The galaxies used as a measure of the environment
around the targets are drawn from S18a internal data released by the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic
Program (HSC-SSP). We found that, among the five AGN and blue galaxy samples considered, the environment
of AGN-LG pairs is the most enriched with luminous galaxies. We also found an enhancement in the number
of mass-selected clusters in the AGN-LG pair sample against those in the other samples. The results
obtained in this study indicate that existence of multiple clusters is the major driver in the association
of AGNs and LGs, rather than a single large-mass dark matter halo hosting the AGN.
