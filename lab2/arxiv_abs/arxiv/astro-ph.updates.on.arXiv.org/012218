Exoplanet discoveries have motivated numerous efforts to find unseen populations of exomoons,
yet they have been unsuccessful. A plausible explanation is that most discovered planets are located
on close-in orbits, which would make their moons prone to tidal evolution and orbital detachment.
In recent models of tidally-driven migration of exomoons, evolving planets might prevent what
was considered their most plausible fate (i.e. colliding against their host planet), favouring
scenarios where moons are pushed away and reach what we define as the "satellite tidal orbital parking"
distance ($a_\mathrm{stop}$), which is often within the critical limit for unstable orbits and
depends mainly on the system's initial conditions: mass-ratio, semi-major axes, and rotational
rates. By using semi-analytical calculations and numerical simulations, we calculate $a_\mathrm{stop}$
for different initial system parameters and constrain the transit detectability of exomoons around
close-in planets. We found that systems with $M_\mathrm{m}/M_\mathrm{p} \geq 10^{-4}$, which
are less likely to form, are also stable and detectable with present facilities (e.g. Kepler and
TESS) through their direct and secondary effects in planet+moon transit, as they are massive, oversized,
and migrate slowly. In contrast, systems with lower moon-to-planet mass ratios are "ephemeral"
and hardly detectable. Moreover, any detection, confirmation, and full characterisation would
require both the short cadence capabilities of TESS and high photometric sensitivity of ground-based
observatories. Finally, despite the shortage of discovered long-period planets in currently
available databases, the tidal migration model adopted in this work supports the idea that they
are more likely to host the first detectable exomoon.
