This paper presents a quantitative study of the evolution of the ejecta cloud released from a hypervelocity
impact on a binary asteroid. We performed numerical simulations of the post-impact dynamics of
the ejecta cloud in the framework of the current mission scenario of AIDA mission project. A grid
search of launching sites of ejecta was defined over the globe of Didymoon, and considering a wide
range of possible ejection speeds, we determined the dependency of ejecta fate on launching sites
(projectile impact sites) and speeds. This range allows us to track all the complex cases that include
different types of dynamical fates. Two major mechanisms are found to be working broadly during
the post-ejection evolution of the ejecta cloud: 1) ejecta on mean motion resonance orbits with
Didymoon produce long-term quasi-periodic showers onto Didymoon over at least a couple of weeks
after the projectile impact, 2) ejecta on non-resonant orbits produce a rapid and high re-accretion
flux. This rapid and high flux occurs just once because ejecta on such orbits leave the system unless
they experience a collision during their first encounter. For the second part of this study, we performed
full-scale simulations of the ejecta cloud released from 6 hypothetical impact sites. We considered
two kinds of material composing Didymoon's subsurface and then combined a power-law size distribution
of the ejecta with an ejection speed distribution. We find that the ejecta cloud evolution can be
divided in two periods. It starts with a first violent period (<10 hr) with fast re-accretion or ejection
from the system. A second period is found to be more sensitive to the launching site than the first
one. During this second period, ejecta will either re-accrete or being ejected from the system,
depending both on their sizes and on their average survival time in close proximity of the binary
components.
