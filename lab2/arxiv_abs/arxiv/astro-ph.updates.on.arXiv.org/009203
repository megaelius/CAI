Research over the past decade has shown diminishing empirical evidence for major galaxy mergers
being a dominating or even important mechanism for the growth of supermassive black holes in galaxies
and the triggering of optically or X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGN). We here for the first
time test whether such a connection exists at least in the most plausible part of parameter space
for this mechanism: the highest specific accretion rate broad-line AGNs at the peak epoch of black
hole activity around z = 2. To that end we examine 21 galaxies hosting a high accreting black hole (L/Ledd
> 0.7) observed with HST/WFC3 and 92 stellar mass- and redshift- matched inactive galaxies taken
from the CANDELS survey. We removed the AGN point sources from their host galaxies and avoided bias
in visual classification by adding and then subtracting mock point sources to and from the comparison
galaxies, producing matched residual structures for both sets. The resulting samples were joined,
randomized, and subsequently visually ranked with respect to perceived strength of structural
distortions by 10 experts. The ensuing individual rankings were combined into a consensus sequence
and from this we derived merger fractions for both samples. With the merger fractions f$_{m,agn}$
= 0.24 $\pm$ 0.09 for the AGN host galaxy sample and f$_{m,ina}$ = 0.19 $\pm$ 0.04 for the inactive
galaxies, we find no significant difference between the AGN host galaxies and inactive galaxies.
Also, both samples display comparable fractions of disk-dominated galaxies. These findings are
consistent with previous studies for different AGN populations, and we conclude that even black
hole growth at the highest specific accretion rates and at the peak of cosmic AGN activity is not predominantly
caused by major mergers. (abriged)
