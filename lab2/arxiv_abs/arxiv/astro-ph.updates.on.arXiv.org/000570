Small scale magnetic fields can be observed on the Sun in G-band filtergrams as MBPs (magnetic bright
points) or identified in spectro-polarimetric measurements due to enhanced signals of Stokes
profiles. These magnetic fields and their dynamics play a crucial role in understanding the coronal
heating problem and also in surface dynamo models. MBPs can theoretically be described to evolve
out of a patch of a solar photospheric magnetic field with values below the equipartition field strength
by the so-called convective collapse model. After the collapse, the magnetic field of MBPs reaches
a higher stable magnetic field level. The magnetic field strength distribution of small scale magnetic
fields as seen by MBPs is inferred. Furthermore, we want to test the model of convective collapse
and the theoretically predicted stable value of about 1300 G. We used four different data sets of
high-resolution Hinode/SOT observations that were recorded simultaneously with the broadband
filter device (G-band, Ca II-H) and the spectro-polarimeter. To derive the magnetic field strength
distribution of these small scale features, the spectropolarimeter (SP) data sets were treated
by the Merlin inversion code. The four data sets comprise different solar surface types: active
regions (a sunspot group and a region with pores), as well as quiet Sun. In all four cases the obtained
magnetic field strength distribution of MBPs is similar and shows peaks around 1300 G. This agrees
well with the theoretical prediction of the convective collapse model. The resulting magnetic
field strength distribution can be fitted in each case by a model consisting of log-normal components.
The important parameters, such as geometrical mean value and multiplicative standard deviation,
are similar in all data sets, only the relative weighting of the components is different.
