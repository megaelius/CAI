Growing evidence suggests that Type Iax supernovae might be the result of thermonuclear deflagrations
of Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs in binary systems. We carry out Monte Carlo radiative transfer
simulations and predict spectropolarimetric features originating from the supernova explosion
and subsequent ejecta interaction with the companion star. Specifically, we calculate viewing-angle
dependent flux and polarisation spectra for a 3D model simulating the deflagration of a Chandrasekhar-mass
white dwarf and, for a second model, simulating the ejecta interaction with a main-sequence star.
We find that the intrinsic signal is weakly polarised and only mildly viewing-angle dependent,
owing to the overall spherical symmetry of the explosion and the depolarising contribution of iron-group
elements dominating the ejecta composition. The interaction with the companion star carves out
a cavity in the ejecta and produces a detectable, but modest signal that is significant only at relatively
blue wavelengths ($\lesssim$ 5000 $\unicode{x212B}$). In particular, increasingly fainter
and redder spectra are predicted for observer orientations further from the cavity, while a modest
polarisation signal $P\sim0.2$ per cent is found at blue wavelengths for orientations 30$^\circ$
and 45$^\circ$ away from the cavity. We find a reasonable agreement between the interaction model
viewed from these orientations and spectropolarimetric data of SN 2005hk and interpret the maximum-light
polarisation signal seen at blue wavelengths for this event as a possible signature of the ejecta-companion
interaction. We encourage further polarimetric observations of SNe Iax to test whether our results
can be extended and generalised to the whole SN Iax class.
