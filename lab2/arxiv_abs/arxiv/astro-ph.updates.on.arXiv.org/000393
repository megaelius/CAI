IRAS 05399-0121/SMM 1, which is a dense double-core system in Orion B9, was mapped with APEX/SABOCA
at 350 micron. We combine these data with our previous LABOCA 870-micron data. The spatial resolution
of the new SABOCA image, ~3400 AU, is about 2.6 times better than provided by LABOCA. We also make use
of the Spitzer infrared observations to characterise the star-formation activity in the source.
The filamentary source remains a double-core system on the 3400 AU scale probed here, and the projected
separation between IRAS 05399 and SMM 1 is 0.14 pc. The temperature map reveals warm spots towards
IRAS 05399 and the southeastern tip of the source. Both IRAS 05399 and SMM 1 stand out as peaks in the
column density map. A simple analysis suggests that the density profile is of the form ~r^-(2.3_{-0.9}^{+2.2}),
as determined at the position of SMM 1. The broadband spectral energy distribution of IRAS 05399
suggests that it is near the Stage 0/I borderline. A visual inspection of the Spitzer/IRAC images
provides hints of a quadrupolar-like jet morphology around IRAS 05399, supporting the possibility
that it is a binary system. The source splitting into two subcores along the long axis can be explained
by cylindrical Jeans-type fragmentation but the steepness of the density profile is shallower
than what is expected for an isothermal cylinder. The difference between the evolutionary stages
of IRAS 05399 (protostellar) and SMM 1 (starless) suggests that the former has experienced a phase
of rapid mass accretion, supported by the very long outflow it drives. The protostellar jet from
IRAS 05399 might have influenced the nearby core SMM 1. In particular, the temperature map features
are likely to be imprints of protostellar or shock heating, while external heating could be provided
by the nearby high-mass star-forming region NGC 2024.
