Using data from ALMA and near-infrared (NIR) integral field spectrographs including both SINFONI
and KMOS on the VLT, we investigate the two-dimensional distributions of H$\alpha$ and rest-frame
far-infrared (FIR) continuum in six submillimeter galaxies at $z\sim2$. At a similar spatial resolution
($\sim$0.5" FWHM; $\sim$4.5 kpc at $z=2$), we find that the half-light radius of H$\alpha$ is significantly
larger than that of the FIR continuum in half of the sample, and on average H$\alpha$ is a median factor
of $2.0\pm0.4$ larger. Having explored various ways to correct for the attenuation, we find that
the attenuation-corrected H$\alpha$-based SFRs are systematically lower than the IR-based SFRs
by at least a median factor of $3\pm1$, which cannot be explained by the difference in half-light
radius alone. In addition, we find that in 40% of cases the total $V$-band attenuation ($A_V$) derived
from energy balance modeling of the full ultraviolet(UV)-to-FIR spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) is significantly higher than that derived from SED modeling using only the UV-to-NIR part
of the SEDs, and the discrepancy appears to increase with increasing total infrared luminosity.
Finally, considering all our findings along with the studies in the literature, we postulate that
the dust distributions in SMGs, and possibly also in less IR luminous $z\sim2$ massive star-forming
galaxies, can be decomposed into three main components; the diffuse dust heated by older stellar
populations, the more obscured and extended young star-forming HII regions, and the heavily obscured
central regions that have a low filling factor but dominate the infrared luminosity in which the
majority of attenuation cannot be probed via UV-to-NIR emissions.
