(Abridged) We study stability of gas accretion in Active Galactic Nuclei. Our grid based simulations
cover a radial range from 0.1 to 200 pc. Here, as in previous studies by our group, we include gas radiative
cooling as well as heating by a sub-Eddington X-ray source near the central supermassive black hole
of 10^8 M_{\odot}. Our theoretical estimates and simulations show that for the X-ray luminosity
L_X \sim 0.008 L_{Edd}, the gas is thermally and convectivelly unstable within the computational
domain. In the simulations, we observe that very tiny fluctuations in an initially smooth, spherically
symmetric, accretion flow, grow first linearly and then non-linearly. Consequently, an initially
one-phase flow relatively quickly transitions into a two-phase/cold-hot accretion flow. For
L_X = 0.015 L_{Edd} or higher, the cold clouds continue to accrete but in some regions of the hot phase,
the gas starts to move outward. For L_X < 0.015 L_{Edd}, the cold phase contribution to the total
mass accretion rate only moderately dominates over the hot phase contribution. This result might
have some consequences for cosmological simulations of the so-called AGN feedback problem. Our
simulations confirm the previous results of Barai et al. (2012) who used smoothed particle hydrodynamic
simulations to tackle the same problem. However here, because we use a grid based code to solve equations
in 1-D and 2-D, we are able to follow the gas dynamics at much higher spacial resolution and for longer
time in comparison to the 3-D SPH simulations. One of new features revealed by our simulations is
that the cold condensations in the accretion flow initially form long filaments, but at the later
times, those filaments may break into smaller clouds advected outwards within the hot outflow.
These simulations may serve as an attractive model for the so-called Narrow Line Region in AGN.
