Feedback processes from baryons are expected to strongly affect weak-lensing observables of current
and future cosmological surveys. In this paper we present a new parametrisation of halo profiles
based on gas, stellar, and dark matter density components. This parametrisation is then used to
modify outputs of gravity-only $N$-body simulations (following the prescription of Schneider
and Teyssier [1]) in order to mimic baryon effects on the matter density field. The resulting {\it
baryon correction model} relies on a few well motivated physical parameters and is able to reproduce
the clustering signal of hydrodynamical simulations at three percent accuracy or better at redshift
zero. A detailed study of the baryon suppression effects on the matter power spectrum and the weak
lensing shear correlation reveals that the signal is dominated by two parameters describing the
slope of the gas profile in haloes and the maximum radius of gas ejection. We show that these parameters
can be constrained with the observed gas fraction of galaxy groups and clusters from X-ray data.
Based on these observations we predict a beyond percent effect on the power spectrum above $k=0.2-1.0$
h/Mpc with a maximum suppression of 15-25 percent around $k\sim 10$ h/Mpc. As a result, the weak lensing
angular shear power spectrum is suppressed by 10-20 percent at scales beyond $\ell\sim 200-1000$
and the shear correlations $\xi_{+}$ and $\xi_{-}$ are affected at the 10-25 percent level below
5 and 50 arc-minutes, respectively. The relatively large uncertainties of these predictions are
a result of the poorly known hydrostatic mass bias of current X-ray observations as well as the generic
difficulty to observe the low density gas outside of haloes.
