In this paper, we present the results of our three-dimensional, multi-group, multi-neutrino-species
radiation/hydrodynamic simulation using the state-of-the-art code F{\sc{ornax}} of the terminal
dynamics of the core of a non-rotating 16-M$_{\odot}$ stellar progenitor. The calculation incorporates
redistribution by inelastic scattering, a correction for the effect of many-body interactions
on the neutrino-nucleon scattering rates, approximate general relativity (including the effects
of gravitational redshifts), velocity-dependent frequency advection, and an implementation
of initial perturbations in the progenitor core. The model explodes within $\sim$100 milliseconds
of bounce (near when the silicon-oxygen interface is accreted through the temporarily-stalled
shock) and by the end of the simulation (here, $\sim$677 milliseconds after bounce) is accumulating
explosion energy at a rate of $\sim$2.5$\times$10$^{50}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. The supernova explosion
resembles an asymmetrical multi-plume structure, with one hemisphere predominating. The gravitational
mass of the residual proto-neutron star at $\sim$677 milliseconds is $\sim$1.42 M$_{\odot}$.
Even at the end of the simulation, explosion in most of the solid angle is accompanied by some accretion
in an annular fraction at the wasp-like waist of the debris field. The ejecta electron fraction (Y$_e$)
is distributed from $\sim$0.48 to $\sim$0.56, with most of the ejecta mass proton-rich. This may
have implications for supernova nucleosynthesis, and could have a bearing on the p- and $\nu$p-processes
and on the site of the first peak of the r-process. The ejecta spatial distributions of both Y$_e$
and mass density are predominantly in wide-angle plumes and large-scale structures, but are nevertheless
quite patchy.
