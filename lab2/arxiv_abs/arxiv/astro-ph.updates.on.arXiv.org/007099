Rup147 is the closest old open cluster, with a distance of less than 300 pc and an age of about 2.5Gyr.
It is therefore well suited for testing stellar evolution models and for obtaining precise and detailed
chemical abundance information. We combined photometric and astrometric information coming
from literature and the Gaia mission with very high-resolution optical spectra of stars in different
evolutionary stages to derive the cluster distance, age, and detailed chemical composition. We
obtained spectra of six red giants using HARPS-N at the TNG. We also used ESO archive spectra of 22
main sequence stars, observed with HARPS at the 3.6m telescope. The very high resolution (115000)
and the large wavelength coverage (about 380-680nm) of the twin instruments permitted us to derive
atmospheric parameters, metallicity, and detailed chemical abundances of 23 species from all
nucleosynthetic channels. We employed both equivalent widths and spectrum synthesis. We also
re-derived the cluster distance and age using Gaia parallaxes, proper motions, and photometry
in conjunction with the PARSEC stellar evolutionary models. We fully analysed those stars with
radial velocity and proper motion/parallax in agreement with the cluster mean values. We also discarded
one binary not previously recognised, and six stars near the MS turn-off because of their high rotation
velocity. Our final sample consists of 21 stars (six giants and 15 MS stars). We measured metallicity
(the cluster average [Fe/H] is +0.08, rms=0.07) and abundances of light, {\alpha}, Fe-peak, and
neutron-capture elements. The Li abundance follows the expectations, showing a tight relation
between temperature and abundance on the MS, at variance with M67, and we did not detect any Li-rich
giant. We confirm that Rup147 is the oldest nearby open cluster. This makes it very valuable to test
detailed features of stellar evolutionary models.
