Aims. The Sun shows strong variability in its magnetic activity, from Grand minima to Grand maxima,
but the nature of the variability is not fully understood, mostly because of the insufficient length
of the directly observed solar activity records and of uncertainties related to long-term reconstructions.
Here we present a new adjustment-free reconstruction of solar activity over three millennia and
study its different modes. Methods. We present a new adjustment-free, physical reconstruction
of solar activity over the past three millennia, using the latest verified carbon cycle, 14C production,
and archeomagnetic field models. This great improvement allowed us to study different modes of
solar activity at an unprecedented level of details. Results. The distribution of solar activity
is clearly bi-modal, implying the existence of distinct modes of activity. The main regular activity
mode corresponds to moderate activity that varies in a relatively narrow band between sunspot numbers
about 20 and 67. The existence of a separate Grand minimum mode with reduced solar activity, which
cannot be explained by random fluctuations of the regular mode, is confirmed at a high confidence
level. The possible existence of a separate Grand maximum mode is also suggested, but the statistics
is too low to reach a confident conclusion. Conclusions. The Sun is shown to operate in distinct modes
- a main general mode, a Grand minimum mode corresponding to an inactive Sun, and a possible Grand
maximum mode corresponding to an unusually active Sun. These results provide important constraints
for both dynamo models of Sun-like stars and investigations of possible solar influence on Earth's
climate.
