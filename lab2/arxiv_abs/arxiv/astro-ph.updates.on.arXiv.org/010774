Vortex coronagraphs are an attractive solution for imaging exoplanets with future space telescopes
due to their relatively high throughput, large spectral bandwidth, and low sensitivity to low-order
aberrations compared to other coronagraphs with similar inner working angles. Most of the vortex
coronagraph mask development for space applications has focused on generating a polychromatic,
vectorial, optical vortex using multiple layers of liquid crystal polymers. While this approach
has been the most successful thus far, current fabrication processes achieve retardance errors
of 0.1-1.0$^\circ$, which causes a nonnegligible fraction of the starlight to leak through the
coronagraph. Circular polarizers are typically used to reject the stellar leakage reducing the
throughput by a factor of two. Vector vortex masks also complicate wavefront control because they
imprint conjugated phase ramps on the orthogonal circular polarization components, which may
need to be split in order to properly sense and suppress the starlight. Scalar vortex masks can potentially
circumvent these limitations by applying the same phase shift to all incident light regardless
of the polarization state and thus have the potential to significantly improve the performance
of vortex coronagraphs. We present scalar vortex coronagraph designs that make use of focal plane
masks with multiple layers of dielectrics that (a) produce phase patterns that are relatively friendly
to standard manufacturing processes and (b) achieve sufficient broadband starlight suppression,
in theory, for imaging Earth-like planets with future space telescopes.
