By comparing MgII absorption in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of group environments to isolated
galaxies, we investigated the impact of environment on the CGM. A MgII absorber is associated with
a group if there are two or more galaxies at the absorption redshift within a projected distance of
D=200 kpc from a background quasar and a line-of-sight velocity separation of 500 km/s. We compiled
a sample of 29 group environments consisting of 74 galaxies (2-5 galaxies per group) at $0.113<z_{\rm
gal}<0.888$. The group absorber median equivalent width ($\langle W_r(2796)\rangle=0.65\pm0.13$
{\AA}) and covering fraction ($f_c=0.89_{-0.09}^{+0.05}$) are larger than isolated absorbers
($1.27\sigma$ and $2.2\sigma$, respectively) but median column densities are statistically
consistent. A pixel-velocity two-point correlation function analysis shows that group environment
kinematics are statistically comparable to isolated environments ($0.8\sigma$), but with more
power for high velocity dispersions similar to outflow kinematics. Group absorbers display more
optical depth at larger velocities. A superposition model in which multiple galaxies contribute
to the observed gas matches larger equivalent width group absorbers, but overpredicts the kinematics
significantly due to large velocity separations between member galaxies. Finally, galaxy--galaxy
groups (similar member galaxy luminosities) may have larger absorber median equivalent widths
($1.7\sigma$) and velocity dispersions ($2.5\sigma$) than galaxy--dwarf groups (disparate
luminosities). We suggest the observed gas is coupled to the group rather than individual galaxies,
forming an intragroup medium. Gas may be deposited into this medium by multiple galaxies via outflowing
winds undergoing an intergalactic transfer between member galaxies or from tidal stripping of
interacting members.
