We present the cluster mass-richness scaling relation calibrated by a weak lensing analysis of
>18,000 galaxy cluster candidates in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS).
Detected using the 3D-Matched-Filter cluster-finder of Milkeraitis et al., these cluster candidates
span a wide range of masses, from the small group scale up to $\sim10^{15} M_{\odot}$, and redshifts
0.2 $\lesssim z\lesssim$ 0.9. The total significance of the shear measurement amounts to 54$\sigma$.
We compare cluster masses determined using weak lensing shear and magnification, finding the measurements
in individual richness bins to yield 1$\sigma$ compatibility, but with magnification estimates
biased low. This first direct mass comparison yields important insights for improving the systematics
handling of future lensing magnification work. In addition, we confirm analyses that suggest cluster
miscentring has an important effect on the observed 3D-Matched-Filter halo profiles, and we quantify
this by fitting for projected cluster centroid offsets, which are typically $\sim$ 0.4 arcmin.
We bin the cluster candidates as a function of redshift, finding similar cluster masses and richness
across the full range up to $z \sim$ 0.9. We measure the 3D-MF mass-richness scaling relation $M_{200
} = M_0 (N_{200} / 20)^\beta$. We find a normalization $M_0 \sim (2.7^{+0.5}_{-0.4}) \times 10^{13}
M_{\odot}$, and a logarithmic slope of $\beta \sim 1.4 \pm 0.1$, both of which are in 1$\sigma$ agreement
with results from the magnification analysis. We find no evidence for a redshift-dependence of
the normalization. The CFHTLenS 3D-Matched-Filter cluster catalogue is now available at cfhtlens.org.
