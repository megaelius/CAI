Magnetic reconnection is thought to drive a wide variety of dynamic phenomena in the solar atmosphere.
Yet the detailed physical mechanisms driving reconnection are difficult to discern in the remote
sensing observations that are used to study the solar atmosphere. In this paper we exploit the high-resolution
instruments Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the new CHROMIS Fabry-Perot instrument
at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) to identify the intermittency of magnetic reconnection
and its association with the formation of plasmoids in so-called UV bursts in the low solar atmosphere.
The Si IV 1403A UV burst spectra from the transition region show evidence of highly broadened line
profiles with often non-Gaussian and triangular shapes, in addition to signatures of bidirectional
flows. Such profiles had previously been linked, in idealized numerical simulations, to magnetic
reconnection driven by the plasmoid instability. Simultaneous CHROMIS images in the chromospheric
Ca II K 3934A line now provide compelling evidence for the presence of plasmoids, by revealing highly
dynamic and rapidly moving brightenings that are smaller than 0.2 arcsec and that evolve on timescales
of order seconds. Our interpretation of the observations is supported by detailed comparisons
with synthetic observables from advanced numerical simulations of magnetic reconnection and
associated plasmoids in the chromosphere. Our results highlight how subarcsecond imaging spectroscopy
sensitive to a wide range of temperatures combined with advanced numerical simulations that are
realistic enough to compare with observations can directly reveal the small-scale physical processes
that drive the wide range of phenomena in the solar atmosphere.
