We propose an alternative approach to the construction of fitting functions to the nonlinear matter
power spectrum extracted from $N$-body simulations based on the relative matter power spectrum
$\delta(k,a)$, defined as the fractional deviation in the absolute matter power spectrum produced
by a target cosmology away from a reference $\Lambda$CDM prediction. From the computational perspective,
$\delta(k,a)$ is fairly insensitive to the specifics of the simulation settings, and numerical
convergence at the 1%-level can be readily achieved without the need for huge computing capacity.
Furthermore, $\delta(k,a)$ exhibits several interesting properties that enable a piece-wise
construction of the full fitting function, whereby component fitting functions are sought for
single-parameter variations and then multiplied together to form the final product. Then, to obtain
1%-accurate absolute power spectrum predictions for any target cosmology only requires that the
community as a whole invests in producing one single ultra-precise reference $\Lambda$CDM absolute
power spectrum, to be combined with the fitting function to produce the desired result. To illustrate
the power of this approach, we have constructed the fitting function RelFit using only five relatively
inexpensive $w$CDM simulations (box length $L=256 h^{-1}$Mpc, $N=1024^3$ particles, initialised
at $z_i=49$). In a 6-parameter space spanning $\{\omega_m,A_s,n_s,w,\omega_b,h\}$, the output
relative power spectra of RelFit are consistent with the predictions of the CosmicEmu emulator
to 1% or better for a wide range of cosmologies up to $k\simeq 10$/Mpc. Thus, our approach could provide
an inexpensive and democratically accessible route to fulfilling the 1%-level accuracy demands
of the upcoming generation of large-scale structure probes, especially in the exploration of "non-standard"
or "exotic" cosmologies on nonlinear scales.
