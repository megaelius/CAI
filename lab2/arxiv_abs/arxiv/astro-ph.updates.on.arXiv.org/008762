The clustered nature of star formation should produce a high degree of structure in the combined
phase and chemical space in the Galactic disk. To date, observed structure of this kind has been mostly
limited to bound clusters and moving groups. In this paper we present a new dynamical model of the
Galactic disk that takes into account the clustered nature of star formation. This model predicts
that the combined phase and chemical space is rich in substructure, and that this structure is sensitive
to both the precise nature of clustered star formation and the large-scale properties of the Galaxy.
The model self-consistently evolves 4 billion stars over the last 5 Gyr in a realistic potential
that includes an axisymmetric component, a bar, spiral arms, and giant molecular clouds (GMCs).
All stars are born in clusters with an observationally-motivated range of initial conditions.
As direct \textit{N}-body calculations for billions of stars is computationally infeasible,
we have developed a method of initializing star cluster particles to mimic the effects of direct
\textit{N}-body effects, while the actual orbit integrations are treated as test particles within
the analytic potential. We demonstrate that the combination of chemical and phase space information
is much more effective at identifying truly co-natal populations than either chemical or phase
space alone. Furthermore, we show that co-moving pairs of stars are very likely to be co-natal if
their velocity separation is $< 2$ km s$^{-1}$ and their metallicity separation is $< 0.05$ dex.
The results presented here bode well for harnessing the synergies between \textit{Gaia} and spectroscopic
surveys to reveal the assembly history of the Galactic disk.
