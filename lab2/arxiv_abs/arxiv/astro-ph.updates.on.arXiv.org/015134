We present a series of new, publicly available mock catalogs of X-ray selected active galactic nuclei
(AGNs), non-active galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. They are based on up-to-date observational
results on the demographic of extragalactic X-ray sources and their extrapolations.These mocks
reach fluxes below 1E-20 erg s-1 cm-2 in the 0.5-2 keV band, i.e., more than an order of magnitude below
the predicted limits of future deep fields, and therefore represent an important tool for simulating
extragalactic X-ray surveys with both current and future telescopes. We use our mocks to perform
a set of end-to-end simulations of X-ray surveys with the forthcoming Athena mission and with the
AXIS probe, a sub-arcsecond resolution X-ray mission concept proposed to the Astro 2020 Decadal
Survey. We find that these proposed, next generation surveys may transform our knowledge of the
deep X-ray Universe. As an example, in a total observing time of 15\,Ms, AXIS would detect ~225,000
AGNs and ~$50,000 non-active galaxies, reaching a flux limit f_0.5-2~5E-19 erg/s/cm2 in the 0.5-2
keV band, with an improvement of over an order of magnitude with respect to surveys with current X-ray
facilities. Consequently, 90% of these sources would be detected for the first time in the X-rays.
Furthermore, we show that deep and wide X-ray surveys with instruments like AXIS and Athena are expected
to detect ~20,000 z>3 AGNs and ~250 sources at redshift z>6, thus opening a new window of knowledge
on the evolution of AGNs over cosmic time and putting strong constraints on the predictions of theoretical
models of black hole seed accretion in the early universe.
