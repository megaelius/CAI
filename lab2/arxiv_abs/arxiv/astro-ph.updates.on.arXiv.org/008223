We here study extended classes of logotropic fluids as \textit{unified dark energy models}. Under
the hypothesis of the Anton-Schmidt scenario, we consider the universe obeying a single fluid whose
pressure evolves through a logarithmic equation of state. This result is in analogy with crystals
under isotropic stresses. Thus, we investigate thermodynamic and dynamical consequences by integrating
the speed of sound to obtain the pressure in terms of the density, leading to an extended version of
the Anton-Schmidt cosmic fluids. Within this picture, we get significant outcomes expanding the
Anton-Schmidt pressure in the infrared regime. The low-energy case becomes relevant for the universe
to accelerate without any cosmological constant. We therefore derive the effective representation
of our fluid in terms of a Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}(X)$, depending on the kinetic term
$X$ only. We analyze both the relativistic and non-relativistic limits. In the non-relativistic
limit we construct both the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian in terms of density $\rho$ and scalar field
$\vartheta$, whereas in the relativistic case no analytical expression for the Lagrangian can
be found. Thus, we obtain the potential as a function of $\rho$, under the hypothesis of irrotational
perfect fluid. We demonstrate that the model represents a natural generalization of \emph{logotropic
dark energy models}. Finally, we analyze an extended class of generalized Chaplygin gas models
with one extra parameter $\beta$. Interestingly, we find that the Lagrangians of this scenario
and the pure logotropic one coincide in the non-relativistic regime.
