[abridged] Unbound young stellar systems, the loose ensembles of physically related young bright
stars, trace the typical regions of recent star formation in galaxies. Their morphologies vary
from small associations of stars to enormous stellar complexes. Being associated with star-forming
regions of various sizes, they trace the regions where stars form at various scales, from compact
clusters to whole galactic disks. They have been, thus, the focus of several studies with special
interest on their demographics, classification, and structural morphology. Their surveys demonstrate
that the clear distinction of these systems into well-defined classes is not straightforward,
due to their low densities, asymmetric shapes and variety in structural parameters. Unbound stellar
structures follow a hierarchical clustering pattern up to the scale of a whole star-forming galaxy.
This structural pattern, which is usually characterized as self-similar or fractal, appears to
be identical to that of star-forming giant molecular clouds and interstellar gas, driven mainly
by turbulence cascade. In this short review, I make a concise compilation of our understanding of
unbound young stellar systems across various environments in the local universe, as it is developed
during the last 60 years. I present a factual assessment of the clustering behavior of star formation,
as revealed from the assembling pattern of stars across loose stellar structures and its relation
to the interstellar medium and the environmental conditions. I also provide a consistent account
of the processes that possibly play important role in the formation of unbound stellar systems,
compiled from both theoretical and observational investigations on the field.
