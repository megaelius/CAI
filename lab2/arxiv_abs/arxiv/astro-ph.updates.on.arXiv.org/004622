We use the new Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients (MOSFiT) to model 38 hydrogen-poor superluminous
supernovae (SLSNe). We fit their multicolour light curves with a magnetar spin-down model and present
the posterior distributions of magnetar and ejecta parameters. The colour evolution can be well
matched with a simple absorbed blackbody. We find the following medians (1$\sigma$ ranges): spin
period 2.4 ms (1.2-4 ms); magnetic field $0.8\times 10^{14}$ G (0.2-1.8 $\times 10^{14}$ G); ejecta
mass 4.8 Msun (2.2-12.9 Msun); kinetic energy $3.9\times 10^{51}$ erg (1.9-9.8 $\times 10^{51}$
erg). This significantly narrows the parameter space compared to our priors, showing that although
the model is flexible, the parameter space relevant to SLSNe is well constrained by existing data.
The requirement that the instantaneous engine power is $\sim 10^{44}$ erg at the light curve peak
necessitates either a large rotational energy (P<2 ms), or more commonly that the spin-down and
diffusion timescales be well-matched. We find no evidence for separate populations of fast- and
slow-declining SLSNe, which instead form a continuum both in light curve widths and inferred parameters.
Variations in the spectra are well explained through differences in spin-down power and photospheric
radii at maximum-light. We find no correlations between any model parameters and the properties
of SLSN host galaxies. Comparing our posteriors to stellar evolution models, we show that SLSNe
require rapidly rotating (fastest 10%) massive stars (> 20 Msun), and that this is consistent with
the observed SLSN rate. High mass, low metallicity, and likely binary interaction all serve to maintain
rapid rotation essential for magnetar formation. By reproducing the full set of SLSN light curves,
our posteriors can be used to inform photometric searches for SLSNe in future survey data.
