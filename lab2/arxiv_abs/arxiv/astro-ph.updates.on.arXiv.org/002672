We investigate the kinematics of stars in the mid-plane of the Milky Way on scales between 25 pc and
10 kpc with data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), the
Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE), and the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (GCS). Using red-clump stars
in APOGEE, we determine the large-scale line-of-sight velocity field out to 5 kpc from the Sun in
(0.75 kpc)^2 bins. The solar motion is the largest contribution to the power on large scales after
subtracting an axisymmetric rotation field; we determine the solar motion by minimizing the large-scale
power to be V_sun = 24+/-1 (ran.)+/-2 (syst [V_c])+/-5 (syst. [large-scale]) km/s, where the systematic
uncertainty is due to (a) a conservative 20 km/s uncertainty in V_c and (b) the estimated power on
unobserved larger scales. Combining the APOGEE peculiar-velocity field with red-clump stars
in RAVE out to 2 kpc from the Sun and with local GCS stars, we determine the power spectrum of residual
velocity fluctuations in the Milky Way's disk on scales between 0.2/kpc < k < 40/kpc. Most
of the power is contained in a broad peak between 0.2/kpc < k < 0.9/kpc. We investigate the expected
power spectrum for various non-axisymmetric perturbations and demonstrate that the central bar
with commonly used parameters but of relatively high mass can explain the bulk of velocity fluctuations
in the plane of the Galactic disk near the Sun. Streaming motions ~10 km/s on >~3 kpc scales in the
Milky Way are in good agreement with observations of external galaxies and directly explain why
local determinations of the solar motion are inconsistent with global measurements.
