We present the results of a new search for variable stars in the Local Group dwarf galaxy Leo A, based
on deep photometry from the Advanced Camera for Surveys onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. We detected
166 bona fide variables in our field, of which about 60 percent are new discoveries, and 33 candidate
variables. Of the confirmed variables, we found 156 Cepheids, but only 10 RR Lyrae stars despite
nearly 100 percent completeness at the magnitude of the horizontal branch. The RR Lyrae stars include
7 fundamental and 3 first-overtone pulsators, with mean periods of 0.636 and 0.366 day, respectively.
From their position on the period-luminosity (PL) diagram and light-curve morphology, we classify
91, 58, and 4 Cepheids as fundamental, first-overtone, and second-overtone mode Classical Cepheids
(CC), respectively, and two as population II Cepheids. However, due to the low metallicity of Leo
A, about 90 percent of the detected Cepheids have periods shorter than 1.5 days. Comparison with
theoretical models indicate that some of the fainter stars classified as CC could be Anomalous Cepheids.
We estimate the distance to Leo A using the tip of the RGB (TRGB) and various methods based on the photometric
and pulsational properties of the Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars. The distances obtained with the TRGB
and RR Lyrae stars agree well with each other while that from the Cepheid PL relations is somewhat
larger, which may indicate a mild metallicity effect on the luminosity of the short-period Cepheids.
Due to its very low metallicity, Leo A thus serves as a valuable calibrator of the metallicity dependencies
of the variable star luminosities.
