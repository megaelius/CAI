The INTEGRAL satellite has revealed a previously hidden population of absorbed high-mass X-ray
binaries (HMXBs) hosting supergiant (SG) stars. Among them, IGR J16320-4751 is a classical system
intrinsically obscured by its environment, with a column density of ~10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, composed
by a neutron star (NS, spin period ~1300 s), accreting matter from the stellar wind of an O8I star,
with an orbital period of ~9 d. We analyzed all archival XMM-Newton and Swift/BAT observations,
performing a detailed temporal and spectral analysis of its X-ray emission. XMM-Newton light curves
show high-variability and flaring activity on several timescales. In one observation we detected
two short and bright flares where the flux increased by a factor of ~10 for ~300 s, with similar behavior
in the soft and hard X-ray bands. By inspecting the 4500-day light curves of the Swift/BAT data, we
derived a refined period of 8.99$\pm$0.01 days. The XMM-Newton spectra are characterized by a highly
absorbed continuum and a Fe absorption edge at ~7 keV. We fitted the continuum with a thermally Comptonized
model, and the emission lines with 3 narrow Gaussian functions using two absorption components,
to take into account both the interstellar medium and the intrinsic absorption. We derived the column
density at different orbital phases, showing its clear modulation. We also show that the flux of
the Fe K$\alpha$ line is correlated with the NH column, suggesting a link between absorbing and fluorescent
matter that, together with the orbital modulation, points towards the SG wind as the main contributor
to both continuum absorption and Fe K$\alpha$ emission. Assuming a simple model for the SG wind we
were able to explain the orbital modulation of the absorption column density, Fe K$\alpha$ emission,
and the high-energy Swift/BAT flux, allowing us to constrain the geometrical parameters of the
binary system.
