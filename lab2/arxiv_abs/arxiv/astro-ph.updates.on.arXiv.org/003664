We study magnetic field evolution in AR12371 relating its successive eruptive nature. During the
disk transit of seven days, the AR launched four sequential fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated
with long duration M-class flares. Morphological study delineates a pre-eruptive coronal sigmoid
structure above the polarity inversion line (PIL) similar to Moore et al study. Velocity field derived
from tracked magnetograms indicates persistent shear and converging motions of polarity regions
about the PIL. While these shear motions continue, the crossed arms of two sigmoid elbows are being
brought to interaction by converging motions at the middle of PIL, initiating tether-cutting reconnection
of field lines and the onset of CME explosion. The successive CMEs are explained by a cyclic process
of magnetic energy storage and release terming "sigmoid-to-arcade-to-sigmoid" transformation
driven by photospheric flux motions. Further, the continued shear motions inject helicity flux
of dominant negative sign, which contributes to core field twist and its energy by building a twisted
flux rope (FR). After a limiting value, the excess coronal helicity is expelled by bodily ejection
of the FR initiated by some instability as realized by intermittent CMEs. This AR is in contrast to
the confined AR12192 with predominant negative signed larger helicity flux but very weaker (-0.02turns)
normalised coronal helicity content. While predominant signed helicity flux is a requirement
for CME eruption, our study suggests the magnetic flux normalized helicity flux as a necessary condition
accommodating the role of background flux and appeals a further study of large sample of ARs.
