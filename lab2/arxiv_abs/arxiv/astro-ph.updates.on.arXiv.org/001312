Some super Earths and mini Neptunes will likely have thick atmospheres that are not H2-dominated.
We have developed a photochemistry-thermochemistry kinetic-transport model for exploring the
compositions of thick atmospheres on super Earths and mini Neptunes, applicable for both H2-dominated
atmospheres and non-H2-dominated atmospheres. Using this model to study thick atmospheres for
wide ranges of temperatures and elemental abundances, we classify them into hydrogen-rich atmospheres,
water-rich atmospheres, oxygen-rich atmospheres, and hydrocarbon-rich atmospheres. We find
that carbon has to be in the form of CO2 rather than CH4 or CO in a H2-depleted water-dominated thick
atmosphere, and that the preferred loss of light elements from an oxygen-poor carbon-rich atmosphere
leads to formation of unsaturated hydrocarbons (C2H2 and C2H4). We apply our self-consistent atmosphere
models to compute spectra and diagnostic features for known transiting low-mass exoplanets GJ
1214 b, HD 97658 b, and 55 Cnc e. For GJ 1214 b like planets we find that (1) C2H2 features at 1.0 and 1.5
micron in transmission and C2H2 and C2H4 features at 9-14 micron in thermal emission are diagnostic
for hydrocarbon-rich atmospheres; (2) a detection of water-vapor features and a confirmation
of nonexistence of methane features would provide sufficient evidence for a water-dominated atmosphere.
In general, our simulations show that chemical stability has to be taken into account when interpreting
the spectrum of a super Earth/mini Neptune. Water-dominated atmospheres only exist for carbon
to oxygen ratios much lower than the solar ratio, suggesting that this kind of atmospheres could
be rare.
