Asteroseismology is a promising tool to study Galactic structure and evolution because it can probe
the ages of stars. Earlier attempts comparing seismic data from the {\it Kepler} satellite with
predictions from Galaxy models found that the models predicted more low-mass stars compared to
the observed distribution of masses. It was unclear if the mismatch was due to inaccuracies in the
Galactic models, or the unknown aspects of the selection function of the stars. Using new data from
the K2 mission, which has a well-defined selection function, we find that an old metal-poor thick
disc, as used in previous Galactic models, is incompatible with the asteroseismic information.
We show that spectroscopic measurements of [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] elemental abundances from
the GALAH survey indicate a mean metallicity of $\log (Z/Z_{\odot})=-0.16$ for the thick disc.
Here $Z$ is the effective solar-scaled metallicity, which is a function of [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe].
With the revised disc metallicities, for the first time, the theoretically predicted distribution
of seismic masses show excellent agreement with the observed distribution of masses. This provides
an indirect verification of the asteroseismic mass scaling relation is good to within five percent.
Using an importance-sampling framework that takes the selection function into account, we fit
a population synthesis model of the Galaxy to the observed seismic and spectroscopic data. Assuming
the asteroseismic scaling relations are correct, we estimate the mean age of the thick disc to be
about 10 Gyr, in agreement with the traditional idea of an old $\alpha$-enhanced thick disc.
