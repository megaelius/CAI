The IceCube collaboration has reported neutrinos with energies between ~30 TeV and a few PeV that
are significantly enhanced over the cosmic-ray induced atmospheric background. Viable high-energy
neutrino sources must contain very high-energy and ultra-high energy cosmic rays while efficiently
making PeV neutrinos. Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) and blazars have been considered as candidate cosmic-ray
accelerators. GRBs, including low-luminosity GRBs, can be efficient PeV neutrino emitters for
low bulk Lorentz factor outflows, although the photopion production efficiency needs to be tuned
to simultaneously explain ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Photopion production efficiency of
cosmic-rays accelerated in the inner jets of flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) is ~1-10% due to
interactions with photons of the broad-line region (BLR), whereas BL Lac objects are not effective
PeV neutrino sources due to the lack of external radiation fields. Photopion threshold effects
with BLR photons suppress neutrino production below ~1 PeV, which imply that neutrinos from other
sources would dominate over the diffuse neutrino intensity at sub-PeV energies. Reduction of the
>> PeV neutrino flux can be expected when curving cosmic-ray proton distributions are employed.
Considering a log-parabolic function to describe the cosmic-ray distribution, we discuss possible
implications for particle acceleration in black-hole jets. Our results encourage a search for
IceCube PeV neutrino events associated with gamma-ray loud FSRQs using Fermi-LAT data. In our model,
as found in our previous work, the neutrino flux is suppressed below 1 PeV, which can be tested with
increased IceCube exposure.
