Large scale outflows in star-forming galaxies are observed to be ubiquitous, and are a key aspect
of theoretical modeling of galactic evolution in a cosmological context, the focus of the SMAUG
(Simulating Multiscale Astrophysics to Understand Galaxies) project. Gas blown out from galactic
disks, similar to gas within galaxies, consists of multiple phases with large contrasts of density,
temperature, and other properties. To study multiphase outflows as emergent phenomena, we run
a suite of ~pc-resolution local galactic disk simulations using the TIGRESS framework. Explicit
modeling of the interstellar medium (ISM), including star formation and self-consistent radiative
heating plus supernova feedback, regulates ISM properties and drives the outflow. We investigate
the scaling of outflow mass, momentum, energy, and metal loading factors with galactic disk properties,
including star formation rate (SFR) surface density (\Sigma_SFR~10^{-4}-1 M_sun/kpc^2/yr),
gas surface density (~1-100 M_sun/pc^2), and total midplane pressure (or weight) (~10^3-10^6
k_B cm^{-3} K). The main components of outflowing gas are mass-delivering cool gas (T~10^4 K) and
energy/metal-delivering hot gas (T~10^6 K). Cool mass outflow rates measured at outflow launch
points (one or two scale heights) are 1-100 times the SFR (decreasing with \Sigma_SFR), although
in massive galaxies most mass falls back due to insufficient outflow velocity. The hot galactic
outflow carries mass comparable to 10% of the SFR, together with 10-20% of the energy and 30-60% of
the metal mass injected by SN feedback. The characteristic outflow velocities of both phases scale
very weakly with SFR, as v_out \propto \Sigma_SFR^{0.1~0.2}, consistent with observations. Importantly,
our analysis demonstrates that in any physically-motivated cosmological wind model, it is crucial
to include at least two distinct thermal wind components.
