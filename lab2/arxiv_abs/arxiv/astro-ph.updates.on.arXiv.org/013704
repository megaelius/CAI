A first step in developing a benchmark equation of state (EoS) model for multi-messenger astronomy
is presented that unifies the thermodynamics of quark and hadronic degrees of freedom. A Lagrangian
approach to the thermodynamic potential of quark-meson-nucleon (QMN) matter is used where dynamical
chiral-symmetry breaking is described by the scalar mean-field dynamics coupled to quarks as well
as to nucleons and their chiral partners, whereby its restoration occurs in the hadronic phase by
parity doubling as well as in the quark phase. Quark confinement is achieved by an auxiliary scalar
field that parametrizes a dynamical infrared cutoff in the quark sector, serving as an ultraviolet
cutoff for the nucleonic phase-space. The gap equations are solved for the isospin-symmetric case
as well as for neutron star (NS) conditions. The mass-radius (MR) relation of NSs and their tidal
deformability (TD) parameter are calculated. The obtained EoS is in accordance with nuclear matter
properties at saturation density and with the flow constraint from heavy ion collision experiments.
For isospin-asymmetric matter a sequential occurrence of light quark flavors is obtained, allowing
for a mixed phase of chirally-symmetric nucleonic matter with deconfined down quarks. The MR relations
and TDs for compact stars fulfill the constraints from latest astrophysical observations for PSR
J0740+6620, PSR J0030+0451, and the NS merger GW170817, whereby the tension between the maximum
mass and compactness constraints rather uniquely fixes the model parameters. The model predicts
the existence of stars with a core of chirally restored but purely hadronic (confined) matter for
masses beyond $1.8~M_\odot$. Stars with pure-quark matter cores are found to be unstable against
the gravitational collapse. This instability is shifted still to higher densities if repulsive
interactions between quarks are included.
