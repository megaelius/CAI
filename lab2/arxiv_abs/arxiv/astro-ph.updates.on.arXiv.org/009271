Evidence for exocomets, icy bodies in extrasolar planetary systems, has rapidly increased over
the past decade. Volatiles are detected through the gas that exocomets release as they collide and
grind down within their natal belts, or as they sublimate once scattered inwards to the regions closest
to their host star. Most detections are in young, 10 to a few 100 Myr-old systems that are undergoing
the final stages of terrestrial planet formation. This opens the exciting possibility to study
exocomets at the epoch of volatile delivery to the inner regions of planetary systems. Detection
of molecular and atomic gas in exocometary belts allows us to estimate molecular ice abundances
and overall elemental abundances, enabling comparison with the Solar Nebula and Solar System comets.
At the same time, observing star-grazing exocomets transiting in front of their star (for planetary
systems viewed edge-on) and exozodiacal dust in the systems' innermost regions gives unique dynamical
insights into the inward scattering process producing delivery to inner rocky planets. The rapid
advances of this budding subfield of exoplanetary science will continue in the short term with the
upcoming JWST, WFIRST and PLATO missions. In the longer term, the priority should be to explore the
full composition of exocomets, including species crucial for delivery and later prebiotic synthesis.
Doing so around an increasingly large population of exoplanetary systems is equally important,
to enable comparative studies of young exocomets at the epoch of volatile delivery. We identify
the proposed LUVOIR and Origins flagship missions as the most promising for a large-scale exploration
of exocometary gas, a crucial component of the chemical heritage of young exo-Earths.
