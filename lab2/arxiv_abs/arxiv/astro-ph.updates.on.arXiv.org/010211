Context. Dynamical studies suggest that most of the circumbinary discs (CBDs) should be coplanar,
i.e. the rotation vectors of the binary and the disc are aligned. However, some theoretical works
show that under certain conditions a CBD can become polar, i.e the rotation vector is orthogonal
with respect to the binary orbital plane. Interestingly, very recent observations showed that
polar CBDs exist in Nature (e.g. HD 98800). Aims. We test the predictions of CBD alignment around
eccentric binaries based on linear theory. In particular, we compare prograde and retrograde CBD
configurations. Then, we thoroughly characterise the orbital behaviour and stability of misaligned
(P-type) particles. Methods. The evolution of the CBD alignment for various configurations is
modelled through three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. For the orbital characterisation
and the analysis stability, we relied on long-term N-body integrations and structure and chaos
indicators, such as $\Delta e$ and MEGNO. Results. We confirm previous analytical predictions
on CBD alignment, but find an unexpected symmetry breaking between prograde and retrograde configurations.
More specifically, we observe polar alignment for a retrograde misaligned CBD that was expected
to become coplanar with respect to the binary disc plane. Therefore, the likelihood of becoming
polar for a highly misaligned CBD is higher than previously thought. Regarding the stability of
circumbinary P-type planets (aka Tatooines), polar orbits are stable over a wide range of binary
parameters. In particular, for binary eccentricities below 0.4, the orbits are stable for any value
of the binary mass ratio. In the absence of gas, planets with masses below $10^{-5}$ $M_{\odot}$
have negligible effects on the binary orbit. Finally, we predict that Polar Tatooines should be
searched around mildly eccentric equal-mass binaries.
