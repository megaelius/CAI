Scorpius-Centaurus is the nearest OB association and its hundreds of members were divided into
sub-groups, including Lower Centaurus Crux. Here we study the dynamics of the Lower Centaurus Crux
area stellar content. We report the revelation of a large moving group containing more than 1800
intermediate- and low-mass young stellar objects and brown dwarfs, that escaped identification
until Gaia DR2 allowed to perform a kinematic and photometric selection. We investigate the stellar
and substellar content of this moving group using the Gaia DR2 astrometric and photometric measurements.
The median distance of the members is 114.5 pc and 80% lie between 102 and 135pc from the Sun. Our new
members cover a mass range of 5M$_\odot$ to 0.02M$_\odot$, and add up to a total mass of about 700M$_\odot$.
The present-day mass function follows a log-normal law with m$_c$ = 0.22 M$_\odot$ and $\sigma$
= 0.64. We find more than 200 brown dwarfs in our sample. The star formation rate had its maximum of
$8\times10^{-5}\rm M_\odot yr^{-1}$ at about 9Myr ago, We grouped the new members in four denser
subgroups, which s have increasing age from 7 to 10Myr, surrounded by "free-floating" young stars
with mixed ages. Our isochronal ages, now based on accurate parallaxes, are compatible with several
earlier studies of the region. The whole complex is presently expanding, and the expansion started
between 8 to 10Myr ago. Two hundred members show infrared excess compatible with circumstellar
disks from full to debris disks. This discovery provides a large sample of nearby young stellar and
sub-stellar objects for disk and exoplanet studies.
