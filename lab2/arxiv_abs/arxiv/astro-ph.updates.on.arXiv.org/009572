Non-thermal desorption of inter- and circum-stellar ice mantles on dust grains, in particular
ultraviolet photon-induced desorption, has gained importance in recent years. These processes
may account for the observed gas phase abundances of molecules like CO toward cold interstellar
clouds. Ice mantle growth results from gas molecules impinging on the dust from all directions and
incidence angles. Nevertheless, the effect of the incident angle for deposition on ice photo-desorption
rate has not been studied. This work explores the impact on the accretion and photodesorption rates
of the incidence angle of CO gas molecules with the cold surface during deposition of a CO ice layer.
Infrared spectroscopy monitored CO ice upon deposition at different angles, ultraviolet-irradiation,
and subsequent warm-up. Vacuum-ultraviolet spectroscopy and a Ni-mesh measured the emission
of the ultraviolet lamp. Molecules ejected from the ice to the gas during irradiation or warm-up
were characterized by a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The photodesorption rate of CO ice deposited
at 11 K and different incident angles was rather stable between 0 and 45$^{\circ}$. A maximum in the
CO photodesorption rate appeared around 70$^{\circ}$-incidence deposition angle. The same deposition
angle leads to the maximum surface area of water ice. Although this study of the surface area could
not be performed for CO ice, the similar angle dependence in the photodesorption and the ice surface
area suggests that they are closely related. Further evidence for a dependence of CO ice morphology
on deposition angle is provided by thermal desorption of CO ice experiments.
