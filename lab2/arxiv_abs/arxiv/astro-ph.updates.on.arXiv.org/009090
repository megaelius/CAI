Simulations of neutron star-black hole (NSBH) binaries generally consider black holes with masses
in the range $(5-10)M_\odot$, where we expect to find most stellar mass black holes. The existence
of lower mass black holes, however, cannot be theoretically ruled out. Low-mass black holes in binary
systems with a neutron star companion could mimic neutron star-neutron (NSNS) binaries, as they
power similar gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) signals. To understand the differences
and similarities between NSNS mergers and low-mass NSBH mergers, numerical simulations are required.
Here, we perform a set of simulations of low-mass NSBH mergers, including systems compatible with
GW170817. Our simulations use a composition and temperature dependent equation of state (DD2)
and approximate neutrino transport, but no magnetic fields. We find that low-mass NSBH mergers
produce remnant disks significantly less massive than previously expected, and consistent with
the post-merger outflow mass inferred from GW170817 for moderately asymmetric mass ratio. The
dynamical ejecta produced by systems compatible with GW170817 is negligible except if the mass
ratio and black hole spin are at the edge of the allowed parameter space. That dynamical ejecta is
cold, neutron-rich, and surprisingly slow for ejecta produced during the tidal disruption of a
neutron star : $v\sim (0.1-0.15)c$. We also find that the final mass of the remnant black hole is consistent
with existing analytical predictions, while the final spin of that black hole is noticeably larger
than expected -- up to $\chi_{\rm BH}=0.84$ for our equal mass case.
