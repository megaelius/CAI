A new model has been proposed for magnetic field determination at different distances from the Sun
during different solar cycle phases. The model depends on the observed large-scale non-polar photospheric
magnetic fields and that measured at polar regions from 55N to 90N and from 55S to 90S,which are the
visible manifestations of cyclic changes in the toroidal and poloidal components of the global
magnetic field of the Sun. The modeled magnetic field is determined as the superposition of the non-polar
and the polar photospheric magnetic field cycle variations. The agreement between the model predictions
and magnetic fields derived from direct, in-situ, measurements at different distances from the
Sun, obtained by different methods, and at different solar activity phases is quite satisfactory.
From a comparison of the magnetic fields as observed and as calculated from the model at 1 AU, it should
be concluded that the model magnetic-field variations adequately explains the major features
of the IMF Bx component cycle evolution at the Earth's orbit. The model CR-averaged magnetic fields
correlate with CR-averaged IMF Bx component at the Earth's orbit with a coefficient of 0.688, and
for seven CR-averaged data the correlation reaches 0.808. The model magnetic-field radial profiles
were compared with that of the already existing models. In addition, the decrease in the non-polar
and polar photospheric magnetic fields has been revealed. Both magnetic fields during solar cycle
maxima and that during minima phases decreased from Cycle 21 to Cycle 24. It means that both the toroidal
and poloidal components and therefore, the solar global magnetic field decreased from Cycle 21
to Cycle 24.
