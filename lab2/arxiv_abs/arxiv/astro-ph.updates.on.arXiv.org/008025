We present the first results of our pilot study of 8 photometrically selected Lyman continuum (LyC)
emitting galaxy candidates from the COSMOS field and focus on their optical emission line ratios.
Observations were performed in the H and K bands using the Multi-Object Spectrometer for Infra-Red
Exploration (MOSFIRE) instrument at the Keck Observatory, targeting the [OII], H$\beta$, and
[OIII] emission lines. We find that photometrically selected LyC emitting galaxy candidates have
high ionization parameters, based on their high [OIII]/[OII] ratios (O32), with an average ratio
for our sample of 2.5$\pm$0.2. Preliminary results of our companion Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer
(LRIS) observations, targeting LyC and Ly$\alpha$, show that those galaxies with the largest O32
are typically found to also be Ly$\alpha$ emitters. High O32 galaxies are also found to have tentative
non-zero LyC escape fractions ($f_{esc}(LyC)$) based on $u$ band photometric detections. These
results are consistent with samples of highly ionized galaxies, including confirmed LyC emitting
galaxies from the literature. We also perform a detailed comparison between the observed emission
line ratios and simulated line ratios from density bounded H$_{\textrm{II}}$ regions modeled
using the photoionization code MAPPINGS V. Estimates of $f_{esc}(LyC)$ for our sample fall in the
range from 0.0-0.23 and suggest possible tension with published correlations between O32 and $f_{esc}(LyC)$,
adding weight to dichotomy of arguments in the literature. We highlight the possible effects of
clumpy geometry and mergers that may account for such tension.
