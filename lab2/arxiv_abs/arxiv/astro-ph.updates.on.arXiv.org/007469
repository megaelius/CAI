We study the spatially resolved star formation history and molecular gas distribution of 64 nearby
galaxies, using integral field spectroscopy from the CALIFA survey and CO $J=1\rightarrow 0$ intensity
mapping from the CARMA EDGE survey. We use the 4000 \AA\ break (D$_n$4000), the equivalent width
of the H$\delta$ absorption line (EW H$\delta_A$), and the equivalent width of the H$\alpha$ emission
line (EW H$\alpha$) to measure the recent star formation history (SFH) of these galaxies. We measure
radial profiles of the three SFH indicators and molecular gas mass surface density, from which we
measure the level of centrally enhanced star formation and the molecular gas concentration. When
we separate our galaxies into categories of barred (20 galaxies), unbarred (24 galaxies), and merging/paired
(20 galaxies) we find that the galaxies which have centrally-enhanced star formation (22/64) are
either barred (15/22) or in mergers/pairs (7/22) with relatively high molecular gas concentrations.
A comparison between our barred galaxies and a snapshot of a hydrodynamic $N$-body simulation of
a barred galaxy shows that the current theory of bar formation and evolution can qualitatively reproduce
the main features of the observed galaxies in our sample, including both the sharp decrease of stellar
age in the galactic center and the gradual decrease of age with increasing distance from center.
These findings provide substantial evidence for a picture in which cold gas is transported inward
due to instabilities driven by a bar or tidal interaction, which leads to the growth and rejuvenation
of star formation in the central region.
