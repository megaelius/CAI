The first measurements from the CIBER experiment of extragalactic background light (EBL) in near-infrared
(NIR) band exhibit a higher intensity than those inferred through $\gamma$-ray observations.
Recent theoretical-EBL intensities are typically consistent with the very high energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray
observations. Yet, it is possible that the excess NIR radiation is a new component of EBL and not in
tension with the TeV spectra of distant blazars, since the hypothetical axion-like particle (ALP)
may lead to a reduced opacity of the Universe for VHE $\gamma$-rays. In order to probe whether the
excess component arises mainly from EBL, thirteen observed spectra in high energy and VHE ranges
from ten distant TeV BL Lac objects are fitted by four theoretical spectra which involve theoretical
EBL (Gilmore ), Gilmore's EBL model including photon/ALP coupling, Gilmore's EBL with CIBER excess
and the latter including photon/ALP coupling respectively. We find the goodness of fit for the model
with CIBER excess can be improved with a significance of $7.6~\sigma$ after including the photon/ALP
coupling; Thus, the ALP/photon mixing mechanism can effectively alleviate the tension; However,
the Gilmore EBL model, on the whole, is more compatible with the observed spectra compared to those
with ALP, although individual blazars such as PKS 1424+240 and 1ES 1101-232 prefer the ALP-model.
Our results suggest that the recent EBL models can solely explain the VHE $\gamma$-ray observations,
and assuming the existence of the ALP to alleviate the tension is not required in a statistical sense,
thus the excess over the EBL models is less likely to be a new EBL component.
