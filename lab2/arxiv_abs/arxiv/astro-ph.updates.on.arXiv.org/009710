In the last few years, prominent high-ionization nebular emission lines (i.e., OIII], CIII], CIV,
HeII) have been observed in the deep UV spectra of z~5-7 galaxies, indicating that extreme radiation
fields characterize reionization-era systems. These lines have been linked to the leakage of Lyman
continuum photons both theoretically and observationally. Consequently, high-ionization UV
emission lines present our best probe to detect and characterize the most distant galaxies that
we will observe in the coming years, and are key to understanding the sources of reionization, yet
the physics governing their production is poorly understood. Here we present recent high-resolution
Hubble Space Telescope spectra of two nearby extreme UV emission-line galaxies, J104457 and J141851.
We report the first observations of intense nebular HeII and double-peaked, resonantly-scattered
CIV emission, a combination that suggests these galaxies both produce and transmit a significant
number of very high-energy ionizing photons (E>47.89 eV) through relatively low column densities
of high-ionization gas. This suggests that, in addition to photons at the H-ionizing edge, the very
hard ionizing photons that escape from these galaxies may provide a secondary source of ionization
that is currently unconstrained observationally. Simultaneous radiative transfer models of
LyA and CIV are needed to understand how ionizing radiation is transmitted through both low- and
high-ionization gas. Future rest-frame FUV observations of galaxies within the epoch of reionization
using the JWST or ELTs will allow us to constrain the escape of helium-ionizing photons and provide
an estimate for their contribution to the reionization budget.
