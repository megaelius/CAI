Context. The 16 Myr old star 1SWASP J140747.93-394542.6 (V1400 Cen) underwent a series of complex
eclipses in May 2007, interpreted as the transit of a giant Hill sphere filling debris ring system
around a secondary companion, J1407b. No other eclipses have since been detected, although other
measurements have constrained but not uniquely determined the orbital period of J1407b. Finding
another eclipse towards J1407 will help determine the orbital period of the system, the geometry
of the proposed ring system and enable planning of further observations to characterize the material
within these putative rings. Aims. We carry out a search for other eclipses in photometric data of
J1407 with the aim of constraining the orbital period of J1407b. Methods. We present photometry
from archival photographic plates from the Harvard DASCH survey, and Bamberg and Sonneberg Observatories,
in order to place additional constraints on the orbital period of J1407b by searching for other dimming
and eclipse events. Using a visual inspection of all 387 plates and a period-folding algorithm we
performed a search for other eclipses in these data sets. Results. We find no other deep eclipses
in the data spanning from 1890 to 1990, nor in recent time-series photometry from 2012-2018. Conclusions.
We rule out a large fraction of putative orbital periods for J1407b from 5 to 20 years. These limits
are still marginally consistent with a large Hill sphere filling ring system surrounding a brown
dwarf companion in a bound elliptical orbit about J1407. Issues with the stability of any rings combined
with the lack of detection of another eclipse, suggests that J1407b may not be bound to J1407.
