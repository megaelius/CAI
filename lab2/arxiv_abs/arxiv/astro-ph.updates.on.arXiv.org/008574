Asteroseismology has undergone a profound transformation as a scientific field following the
CoRoT and Kepler space missions. The latter is now yielding the first measurements of latitudinal
differential rotation obtained directly from oscillation frequencies. Differential rotation
is a fundamental mechanism of the stellar dynamo effect. Our goal is to measure the amount of differential
rotation in the solar analogues 16 Cyg A and B, which are the components of a binary system. These stars
are the brightest observed by Kepler and have therefore been extensively observed, with exquisite
precision on their oscillation frequencies. We modelled the acoustic power spectrum of 16 Cyg A
and B using a model that takes into account the contribution of differential rotation to the rotational
frequency splitting. The estimation was carried out in a Bayesian setting. We then inverted these
results to obtain the rotation profile of both stars under the assumption of a solar-like functional
form. We observe that the magnitude of latitudinal differential rotation has a strong chance of
being solar-like for both stars, their rotation rates being higher at the equator than at the pole.
The measured latitudinal differential rotation, defined as the difference of rotation rate between
the equator and the pole, is $320\pm269$ nHz and $440^{+363}_{-383}$ nHz for 16 Cyg A and B, respectively,
confirming that the rotation rates of these stars are almost solar-like. Their equatorial rotation
rates are $535\pm75$ nHz and $565_{-129}^{+150}$ nHz. Our results are in good agreement with measurements
obtained from spectropolarimetry, spectroscopy, and photometry. We present the first conclusive
measurement of latitudinal differential rotation for solar analogues. Their rotational profiles
are very close to those of the Sun. These results depend weakly on the uncertainties of the stellar
parameters.
