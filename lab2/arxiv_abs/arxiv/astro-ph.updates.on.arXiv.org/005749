Using high resolution spectra from the VLT LEGA-C program, we reconstruct the star formation histories
(SFHs) of 607 galaxies at redshifts $z = 0.6-1.0$ and stellar masses $\gtrsim10^{10}$M$_{\odot}$
using a custom full spectrum fitting algorithm that incorporates the emcee and FSPS packages. We
show that the mass-weighted age of a galaxy correlates strongly with stellar velocity dispersion
($\sigma_*$) and ongoing star-formation (SF) activity, with the stellar content in higher-$\sigma_*$
galaxies having formed earlier and faster. The SFHs of quiescent galaxies are generally consistent
with passive evolution since their main SF epoch, but a minority show clear evidence of a rejuvenation
event in their recent past. The mean age of stars in galaxies that are star-forming is generally significantly
younger, with SF peaking after $z<1.5$ for almost all star-forming galaxies in the sample: many
of these still have either constant or rising SFRs on timescales $>100$Myrs. This indicates that
$z>2$ progenitors of $z\sim1$ star-forming galaxies are generally far less massive. Finally,
despite considerable variance in the individual SFHs, we show that the current SF activity of massive
galaxies ($>$L$_*$) at $z\sim1$ correlates with SF levels at least $3$Gyrs prior: SFHs retain `memory'
on a large fraction of the Hubble time. Our results illustrate a novel approach to resolve the formation
phase of galaxies, and in identifying their individual evolutionary paths, connects progenitors
and descendants across cosmic time. This is uniquely enabled by the high-quality continuum spectroscopy
provided by the LEGA-C survey.
