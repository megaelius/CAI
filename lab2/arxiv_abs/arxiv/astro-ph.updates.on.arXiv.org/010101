Among more than 200 quasars known at $z\gtrsim6$, only one object, J0100+2802 (z=6.327), was found
hosting a $>10^{10}M_\odot$ super-massive black hole (SMBH). In order to investigate the host
galaxy properties of J0100+2802, we performed multi-band ALMA observations, aiming at mapping
the dust continuum, [CII] and CO(6-5) emission lines with sub-kiloparsec scale resolution, as
well as detecting high-J CO lines in CO(11-10), CO(10-9), and CO(7-6). The galaxy size is measured
to be $R_{\rm major}=3.6\pm0.2$ kpc from the high resolution continuum observations. No ordered
motion on kilo-parsec scales was found in both [CII] and CO(6-5) emissions. The velocity dispersion
is measured to be 161$\pm$7 km s$^{-1}$, $\sim$3 times smaller than that estimated from the local
M-$\sigma$ relation. In addition, we found that the CO emission is more concentrate (a factor of
1.8$\pm$0.4) than the [CII] emission. Together with CO(2-1) detected by VLA, we measured the CO
Spectral Line Energy Distribution (SLED), which is best fit by a two-components model, including
a cool component at $\sim24$ K with a density of $n_{\rm (H_2)}$=10$^{4.5}$ cm$^{-3}$, and a warm
component at $\sim224$ K with a density of $n_{\rm (H_2)}$=10$^{3.6}$ cm$^{-3}$. We also fitted
the dust continuum with a graybody model, which indicates that it has either a high dust emissivity
$\beta\gtrsim2$ or a hot dust temperature $T_{\rm dust}\gtrsim60$ K, or a combination of both factors.
The highly excited CO emission and hot dust temperature suggest that the powerful AGN in J0100+2802
could contribute to the gas and dust heating although future observations are needed to confirm
this.
