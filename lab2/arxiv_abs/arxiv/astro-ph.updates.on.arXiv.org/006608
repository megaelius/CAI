The X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) is the high resolution X-ray spectrometer of the ESA Athena
X-ray observatory. Over a field of view of 5' equivalent diameter, it will deliver X-ray spectra
from 0.2 to 12 keV with a spectral resolution of 2.5 eV up to 7 keV on ~5 arcsecond pixels. The X-IFU is
based on a large format array of super-conducting molybdenum-gold Transition Edge Sensors cooled
at about 90 mK, each coupled with an absorber made of gold and bismuth with a pitch of 249 microns. A
cryogenic anti-coincidence detector located underneath the prime TES array enables the non X-ray
background to be reduced. A bath temperature of about 50 mK is obtained by a series of mechanical coolers
combining 15K Pulse Tubes, 4K and 2K Joule-Thomson coolers which pre-cool a sub Kelvin cooler made
of a 3He sorption cooler coupled with an Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator. Frequency domain
multiplexing enables to read out 40 pixels in one single channel. A photon interacting with an absorber
leads to a current pulse, amplified by the readout electronics and whose shape is reconstructed
on board to recover its energy with high accuracy. The defocusing capability offered by the Athena
movable mirror assembly enables the X-IFU to observe the brightest X-ray sources of the sky (up to
Crab-like intensities) by spreading the telescope point spread function over hundreds of pixels.
Thus the X-IFU delivers low pile-up, high throughput (>50%), and typically 10 eV spectral resolution
at 1 Crab intensities, i.e. a factor of 10 or more better than Silicon based X-ray detectors. In this
paper, the current X-IFU baseline is presented, together with an assessment of its anticipated
performance in terms of spectral resolution, background, and count rate capability. The X-IFU
baseline configuration will be subject to a preliminary requirement review that is scheduled at
the end of 2018.
