There is growing evidence supporting the coeval growth of galaxies and their resident SMBH. Most
studies also claim a correlation between the activity of the SMBH and the star-formation of the host
galaxy. It is unclear, though, whether this correlation extends to all redz and LX. In this work,
we use data from the X-ATLAS and XMM-XXL North fields and compile the largest X-ray sample up to date,
to investigate how X-ray AGN affect the star-formation of their host galaxies in a wide redz and luminosity
baseline, i.e., 0.03<z<3 and log LX (2-10 keV)= (41-45.5) ergs-1. Our sample consists of 3336 AGN.
1872 X-ray objects have spectroscopic redz. For the remaining sources we calculate photometric
redz using TPZ, a machine-learning algorithm. We estimate stellar masses (M*) and Star Formation
Rates (SFRs) by applying SED fitting through the CIGALE code, using optical, near-IR and mid-IR
photometry. 608 of our sources also have far-IR photometry (Herschel). We use these sources to calibrate
the SFR calculations of the rest of our X-ray sample. Our results show a correlation between the LX
and the SFR, at all redz and LX spanned by our sample. We also find a dependence of the specific SFR (sSFR)
on redz, while there are indications that LX enhances the sSFR even at low redz. We then disentangle
the effects of M* and redz on the SFR and study again its dependence on the LX. Towards this end, we use
the Schreiber et al. formula to estimate the SFR of main sequence galaxies that have the same stellar
mass and redshift as our X-ray AGN. Our analysis reveals that the AGN enhances the star-formation
of its host galaxy, when the galaxy lies below the main sequence and quenches the star-formation
of the galaxy it lives in, when the host lies above the main sequence. Therefore, the effect of AGN
on the SFR of the host galaxy, depends on the location of the galaxy relative to the main sequence.
