We investigate the E/B decomposition of CMB polarization on a masked sky. In real space, operators
of E and B mode decomposition involve only differentials of CMB polarization. We may, therefore
in principle, perform a clean E/B decomposition from incomplete sky data. Since it is impractical
to apply second derivatives to observation data, we usually rely on spherical harmonic transformation
and inverse transformation, instead of using real-space operators. In spherical harmonic representation,
jump discontinuities in a cut sky produces Gibbs phenomenon, unless a spherical harmonic expansion
is made up to an infinitely high multipole. By smoothing a foreground mask, we may suppress the Gibbs
phenomenon effectively in a similar manner to apodization of a foreground mask discussed in other
works. However, we incur foreground contamination by smoothing a foreground mask, because zero-value
pixels in the original mask may be rendered non-zero by the smoothing process. In this work, we investigate
an optimal foreground mask, which ensures proper foreground masking and suppresses Gibbs phenomenon.
We apply our method to a simulated map of the pixel resolution comparable to the Planck satellite.
The simulation shows that the leakage power is lower than unlensed CMB B mode power spectrum of tensor-to-scalar
ratio $r\sim 1\times10^{-7}$. We compare the result with that of the original mask. We find that
the leakage power is reduced by a factor of $10^{6} \sim 10^{9}$ at the cost of a sky fraction $0.07$,
and that the enhancement is highest at lowest multipoles. We confirm that all the zero-value pixels
in the original mask remain zero in our mask. The application of this method to the Planck data will
improve the detectability of primordial tensor perturbation.
