The first directly detected gravitational waves (GW 150914) were emitted by two coalescing black
holes (BHs) with masses of ~36Msun and ~29Msun. Several scenarios have been proposed to put this
detection into an astrophysical context. The evolution of an isolated massive binary system is
among commonly considered models. Various groups have performed detailed binary-evolution calculations
that lead to BH merger events. However, the question remains open whether stars with the predicted
properties really exist. The aim of this paper is to close this gap by providing spectral characteristics
of massive binary BH progenitors during a phase where at least one of the companions is still non-degenerate.
Stellar evolution models predict fundamental stellar parameters. Using these as input for our
stellar atmosphere code (PoWR), we compute a set of models for selected evolutionary stages of massive
merging BH progenitors at different metallicities. The synthetic spectra obtained from our atmosphere
calculations reveal that progenitors of massive BH merger events start their lives as O2-3V stars
that evolve to early-type blue supergiants before they undergo core-collapse during the Wolf-Rayet
phase. Based on our atmosphere models, we provide feedback parameters, broad band magnitudes,
and spectral templates that should help to identify such binaries in the future. The predicted parameter
space for massive BH binary progenitors is partly realized in nature. Comparisons of mass-loss
rates assumed by evolution calculations with empirically determined values reveal significant
differences, suggesting a profound overestimation in evolution models. The consideration of
these findings possibly will entail a shift of the maximum in the predicted binary-BH merger rate
to higher metallicities, i.e. more candidates should be expected than previously assumed in our
cosmic neighborhood.
