Early observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe$\,$Ia) provide essential clues for understanding
the progenitor system that gave rise to the terminal thermonuclear explosion. We present exquisite
observations of SN$\,$2019yvq, the second observed SN$\,$Ia, after iPTF$\,$14atg, to display
an early flash of emission in the ultraviolet (UV) and optical. Our analysis finds that SN$\,$2019yvq
was unusual, even when ignoring the initial flash, in that it was moderately underluminous for an
SN$\,$Ia ($M_g \approx -18.5\,$mag at peak) yet featured very high absorption velocities ($v \approx
15,000\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ for Si II $\lambda$6355 at peak). We find that many of the observational
features of SN$\,$2019yvq, aside from the flash, can be explained if the explosive yield of radioactive
$^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ is relatively low (we measure $M_{^{56}\mathrm{Ni}} = 0.31 \pm 0.05\,M_\odot$)
and it and other iron-group elements are concentrated in the innermost layers of the ejecta. To explain
both the UV/optical flash and peak properties of SN$\,$2019yvq we consider four different models:
interaction between the SN ejecta and a nondegenerate companion, extended clumps of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$
in the outer ejecta, a double-detonation explosion, and the violent merger of two white dwarfs.
Each of these models has shortcomings when compared to the observations; it is clear additional
tuning is required to better match SN$\,$2019yvq. In closing, we predict that the nebular spectra
of SN$\,$2019yvq will feature either H or He emission, if the ejecta collided with a companion, strong
[Ca II] emission, if it was a double detonation, or narrow [O I] emission, if it was due to a violent
merger.
