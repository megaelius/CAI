The EPOCH (EROS-2 periodic variable star classification using machine learning) project aims
to detect periodic variable stars in the EROS-2 light curve database. In this paper, we present the
first result of the classification of periodic variable stars in the EROS-2 LMC database. In order
to classify these variables, we first build a training set by compiling known variables in the Large
Magellanic Could area from the OGLE and MACHO surveys. We crossmatch these variables with the EROS-2
sources and extract 22 variability features from 28,392 light curves of the corresponding EROS-2
sources. We then use Random Forests to classify the EROS-2 sources in the training set. We design
the model to separate not only $\delta$ Scuti stars, RR Lyraes, Cepheids, eclipsing binaries and
long-period variables, the "superclasses", but also their subclasses, such as RRab, RRc, RRd and
RRe for RR Lyraes, and similarly for the other variable types. The model trained using only the superclasses
shows 99% recall and precision while the model trained on all subclasses shows 87% recall and precision.
We apply the trained model to the entire EROS-2 LMC database containing about 29 million sources
and find 117,234 periodic variable candidates. Out of these 117,234 periodic variables, 55,285
have not been discovered by either OGLE or MACHO variability studies. This set comprises 1906 $\delta$
Scuti stars, 6,607 RR Lyraes, 638 Cepheids, 178 Type II Cepheids, 34,562 eclipsing binaries and
11,394 long-period variables. A catalog of these EROS-2 LMC periodic variable stars will be available
online at this http URL and at the CDS website ( this http URL ).
