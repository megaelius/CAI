Herschel surveys of Galactic clouds support a paradigm for low-mass star formation in which dense
filaments play a crucial role. The detailed fragmentation properties of star-forming filaments
remain poorly understood, however, and the validity of the filament paradigm in the high-mass regime
is still unclear. To investigate the density/velocity structure of the filament in the high-mass
star-forming region NGC6334, we conducted ALMA observations in the 3mm continuum and the N2H+(1-0)
line at ~3arcsec resolution. The filament was detected in both tracers. We identified 26 cores at
3mm and 5 velocity-coherent fiber-like features in N2H+ within the filament. The typical length
of, and velocity difference between, the fiber-like features of the NGC6334 filament are reminiscent
of the properties for the fibers of the low-mass star-forming filament B211/B213. Only 2 or 3 of the
5 velocity-coherent features are well aligned with the filament and may represent genuine, fiber
sub-structures. The core mass distribution has a peak at ~10Msun. They can be divided into 7 groups
of cores, closely associated with ArTeMiS clumps. The projected separation between cores and the
projected spacing between clumps are roughly consistent with the effective Jeans length in the
filament and a physical scale of about 4 times the filament width, respectively, suggesting a bimodal
filament fragmentation process. Despite being one order of magnitude denser and more massive than
the B211/B213 filament, the NGC6334 filament has a similar density/velocity structure. The difference
is that the cores in NGC6334 appear to be an order of magnitude denser and more massive than the cores
in Taurus. This suggests that dense filaments may evolve and fragment in a similar manner in low-
and high-mass star-forming regions, and that the filament paradigm may hold in the intermediate-mass
(if not high-mass) star formation regime.
