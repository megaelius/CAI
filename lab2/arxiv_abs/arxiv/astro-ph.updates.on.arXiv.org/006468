The recent detection of ULASJ1342+0928, a bright QSO at $z=7.54$, provides a powerful probe of the
ionisation state of the intervening intergalactic medium, potentially allowing us to set strong
constraints on the epoch of reionisation (EoR). Here we quantify the presence of Ly$\alpha$ damping
wing absorption from the EoR in the spectrum of ULASJ1342+0928. Our Bayesian framework simultaneously
accounts for uncertainties on: (i) the intrinsic QSO emission (obtained from reconstructing the
Ly$\alpha$ profile from a covariance matrix of emission lines) and (ii) the distribution of HII
regions during reionisation (obtained from three different 1.6$^3$ Gpc$^3$ simulations spanning
the range of plausible EoR morphologies). Our analysis is complementary to that in the discovery
paper (Ba\~nados et al.) and the accompanying method paper (Davies et al.) as it focuses solely on
the damping wing imprint redward of Ly$\alpha$ ($1218 < \lambda < 1230$\AA), and uses a different
methodology for (i) and (ii). We recover weak evidence for damping wing absorption. Our intermediate
EoR model yields a volume-weighted neutral hydrogen fraction at $z=7.5$ of $\bar{x}_{\rm HI} =
0.21\substack{+0.17 \\ -0.19}$ (68 per cent). The constraints depend weakly on the EoR morphology.
Our limits are lower than those presented previously, though they are consistent at ~1-1.5$\sigma$.
We attribute this difference to: (i) a lower amplitude intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ profile obtained from
our reconstruction pipeline, driven by correlations with other high-ionisation lines in the spectrum
which are relatively weak; and (ii) only considering transmission redward of Ly$\alpha$ when computing
the likelihood, which reduces the available constraining power but makes the results less model-dependent.
Our results are consistent with previous estimates of the EoR history, and support the picture of
a moderately extended EoR.
