IceCube has reported a very-high-energy neutrino (IceCube-170922A) in a region containing the
blazar TXS 0506+056. Correlated {\gamma}-ray activity has led to the first high-probability association
of a high-energy neutrino with an extragalactic source. This blazar has been found to be in a radio
outburst during the neutrino event. We have performed target-of-opportunity VLBI imaging observations
at 43 GHz frequency with the VLBA two and eight months, respectively, after the neutrino event. We
produced two images of TXS 0506+056 with angular resolutions of (0.2x1.1) mas and (0.2x0.5) mas,
respectively. The source shows a compact, high brightness temperature core (albeit not approaching
the equipartition limit) and a bright and originally very collimated inner jet. Beyond about 0.5
mas from the mm-VLBI core, the jet loses this tight collimation and expands rapidly. During the months
after the neutrino event associated with this source, the overall flux density is rising. This flux
density increase happens solely within the core. The core expands in size with apparent superluminal
velocity during these six months so that the brightness temperature drops by a factor of three in
spite of the strong flux density increase. The radio jet of TXS 0506+056 shows strong signs of deceleration
and/or a spine-sheath structure within the inner 1 mas (corresponding to about 70 pc to 140 pc in deprojected
distance) from the mm-VLBI core. This structure is consistent with theoretical models that attribute
the neutrino and {\gamma}-ray production to interactions of electrons and protons in the highly-relativistic
jet spine with external photons originating from a slower-moving jet region. Proton loading due
to jet-star interactions in the inner host galaxy is suggested as the possible cause of deceleration
