We analyse maps of the spatially-resolved nebular emission of $\approx$1500 star-forming galaxies
at $z\approx0.6$-$2.2$ from deep KMOS and MUSE observations to measure the average shape of their
rotation curves. We use these to test claims for declining rotation curves at large radii in galaxies
at $z\approx1$-$2$ that have been interpreted as evidence for an absence of dark matter. We show
that the shape of the average rotation curves, and the extent to which they decline beyond their peak
velocities, depends upon the normalisation prescription used to construct the average curve.
Normalising in size by the galaxy stellar disk-scale length after accounting for seeing effects
($R_{\rm{d}}^{\prime}$), we construct stacked position-velocity diagrams that trace the average
galaxy rotation curve out to $6R_{\rm{d}}^{\prime}$ ($\approx$13 kpc, on average). Combining
these curves with average HI rotation curves for local systems, we investigate how the shapes of
galaxy rotation curves evolve over $\approx$10 Gyr. The average rotation curve for galaxies binned
in stellar mass, stellar surface mass density and/or redshift is approximately flat, or continues
to rise, out to at least $6R_{\rm{d}}^{\prime}$. We find a trend between the outer slopes of galaxies'
rotation curves and their stellar mass surface densities, with the higher surface density systems
exhibiting flatter rotation curves. Drawing comparisons with hydrodynamical simulations, we
show that the average shapes of the rotation curves for our sample of massive, star-forming galaxies
at $z\approx0$-$2.2$ are consistent with those expected from $\Lambda$CDM theory and imply dark
matter fractions within $6R_{\rm{d}}$ of at least $\approx60$ percent.
