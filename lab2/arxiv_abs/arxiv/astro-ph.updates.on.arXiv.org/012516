Starburst galaxies have elevated star formation rates (SFRs) for their stellar mass. In Ellison
et al. (2018) we used integral field unit (IFU) maps of star formation rate surface density (Sigma_SFR)
and stellar mass surface density (Sigma_*) to show that starburst galaxies in the local universe
are driven by SFRs that are preferentially boosted in their central regions. Here, we present molecular
gas maps obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observatory for 12 central starburst
galaxies at z~0 drawn from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey.
The ALMA and MaNGA data are well matched in spatial resolution, such that the ALMA maps of molecular
gas surface density (Sigma_H2) can be directly compared with MaNGA maps at kpc-scale resolution.
The combination of Sigma_H2, Sigma_* and Sigma_SFR at the same resolution allow us to investigate
whether central starbursts are driven primarily by enhancements in star formation efficiency
(SFE) or by increased gas fractions. By computing offsets from the resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt
relation (Sigma_H2 vs. Sigma_SFR) and the molecular gas main sequence (Sigma_* vs. Sigma_H2),
we conclude that the primary driver of the central starburst is an elevated SFE. We also show that
the enhancement in Sigma_SFR is accompanied by a dilution in O/H, consistent with a triggering that
is induced by metal poor gas inflow. These observational signatures are found in both undisturbed
(9/12 galaxies in our sample) and recently merged galaxies, indicating that both interactions
and secular mechanisms contribute to central starbursts.
