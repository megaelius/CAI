A number of low-mass millisecond pulsar (MSP) binaries in their rotation-powered state exhibit
double-peaked X-ray orbital modulation centered at inferior pulsar conjunction. This state,
which has been known to persist for years, has recently been interpreted as emission from a shock
that enshrouds the pulsar. However, the pressure balance for such a configuration is a crucial unresolved
issue. We consider two scenarios for pressure balance: a companion magnetosphere and stellar mass
loss with gas dominance. It is found that the magnetospheric scenario requires several kilogauss
poloidal fields for isobaric surfaces to enshroud the MSP as well as for the magnetosphere to remain
stable if there is significant mass loss. For the gas-dominated scenario, it is necessary that the
companion wind loses angular momentum prolifically as an advection or heating-dominated flow.
Thermal bremsstrahlung cooling in the flow may be observable as a UV to soft X-ray component independent
of orbital phase if the mass rate is high. We formulate the general requirements for shock stability
against gravitational influences in the pulsar rotation-powered state for the gas-dominated
scenario. We explore stabilizing mechanisms, principally irradiation feedback, which anticipates
correlated shock emission and companion variability and predicts $ F_\gamma/F_{\rm X} \lesssim
14$ for the ratio of pulsar magnetospheric $\gamma$-ray to total shock soft-to-hard X-ray fluxes.
This stability criterion implies an unbroken extension of X-ray power-law emission to hundreds
of keV for some systems. We explore observational discriminants between the gas-dominated and
magnetospheric scenarios, motivating contemporaneous radio through $\gamma$-ray monitoring
of these systems.
