In order to minimize environmental effects and gain an insight into the internal mechanisms that
shape the properties of the early-type dwarf systems, we study one of the few isolated dwarf spheroidal
galaxies (dSphs) of the Local Group (LG): Cetus. We obtained VLT/FORS2 spectra ($R\sim2600$) in
the region of the nIR CaII triplet lines for 80 candidate red giant branch stars. The analysis yielded
line-of-sight velocities and metallicities ([Fe/H]) for 54 bona fide member stars. The kinematic
analysis shows that Cetus is a mainly pressure-supported ($\sigma_v = 11.0_{-1.3}^{+1.6}$ km/s),
dark-matter-dominated system ($M_{1/2}/L_V = 23.9_{-8.9}^{+9.7} M_\odot/L_\odot$) with no
significant signs of internal rotation. We find Cetus to be a metal-poor system with a significant
[Fe/H] spread (median [Fe/H] = -1.71 dex, median-absolute-deviation = 0.49 dex), as expected for
its stellar mass. We report the presence of a mild metallicity gradient compatible with those found
in other dSphs of the same luminosity; we trace the presence of a stellar population gradient also
in the spatial distribution of stars in different evolutionary phases in ancillary SuprimeCam
photometric data. There are tentative indications of two chemo-kinematically distinct sub-populations,
with the more metal-poor stars showing a hotter kinematics than the metal-richer ones. Furthermore,
the photometric dataset reveals the presence of a foreground population that most likely belongs
to the Sagittarius stream. This study represents a first comprehensive analysis of Cetus chemo-kinematic
properties. Our results add Cetus to the growing scatter in stellar-dark matter halo properties
in low-mass galactic systems. The presence of a metallicity gradient akin to those found in similar
systems inhabiting different environments may hint at metallicity gradients in LG early-type
dwarfs being driven by internal mechanisms.
