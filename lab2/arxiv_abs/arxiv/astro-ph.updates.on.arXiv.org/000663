We have obtained deep HST ultraviolet (F275W/F336W) imaging of the lensing cluster Abell1689.
The images are used to identify z~2 star-forming galaxies via their Lyman break. Because of the unprecedented
depth of the images and the large magnification provided by the cluster, we detect galaxies 100x
fainter than previous surveys at this redshift. After removing multiple images, we have 58 galaxies
in our sample between -19.5 < MUV < -13. Because the mass distribution of Abell 1689 is well
constrained, we are able to calculate the intrinsic sensitivity of the observations as a function
of source plane position, allowing determinations of effective volume as a function of luminosity.
We fit the faint-end slope of the luminosity function with our data alone to be alpha=-1.56 +/- 0.13,
somewhat shallower than the values obtained at z > 3. There is no turnover in the luminosity function
down to MUV = -13. The observed trend of increasingly redder UV spectral slopes with luminosity at
higher redshifts is observed in our sample, but with redder slopes at all luminosities and average
reddening of <E(B-V)>= 0.15. We assume the stars in these galaxies are metal poor (0.2 Z_{sun})
compared to their brighter counterparts (Z_{sun}), resulting in bluer assumed intrinsic UV slopes
and larger derived dust extinction. The total UV luminosity density at z~2 is 4.3 x 10^26 erg/s/Hz/Mpc^3,
80% of which is emitted by galaxies in the luminosity range of our sample. Finally, we determine the
star formation rate density from UV-selected galaxies at z~2 (assuming constant dust extinction
correction of 4.2 over all luminosities and a Kroupa IMF) of 0.147 M_{sun}/yr/Mpc^3, significantly
higher than previous determinations because of the additional fainter galaxies and the larger
dust correction factors.[abridged]
