We present 36 spectroscopically confirmed intrinsically UV-faint Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies
from follow-up observations with Keck/DEIMOS of gravitationally lensed high-redshift candidates.
Candidates were selected to be between $5\lesssim z \lesssim 7$ from photometric data using \textit{HST}
and \textit{Spitzer} imaging surveys. We used photometric redshift information to perform an
integrated photometric redshift probability cut $>1\%$ between $5<z<7$ to construct a sample
of 198 high-redshift objects. Our high-redshift sample spans intrinsic UV luminosities from a
few $L^*$ down to $0.001L^*$. We identified 19 high-confidence detections of Ly$\alpha$ and an
additional 17 likely detections. We divided our sample into lower-redshift ($z\sim5.5$) and higher-redshift
($z\sim6.5$) bins and ran Monte Carlo trials, incorporating the strength of the Ly$\alpha$ emission
and the photometric redshift of the non-detections. Considering only objects where Ly$\alpha$
could be detected at EW(Ly$\alpha$)$>$25{\AA} at $3\sigma$ at the fiducial depth of our survey,
and only those galaxies with EW(Ly$\alpha$)$>$25{\AA} as true LAEs, and finally, only objects
with $m_{AB}<26.8$, we found the LAE fraction to be flat, or modestly increase from 0.26$\pm0.04$
to 0.30$\pm0.04$. These values relative to those for lower-redshift samples are consistent with
a rising LAE fraction with redshift out to $z\sim6$, but at $z\sim6.5$ there is some tension between
our results and results from surveys at intrinsically brighter luminosities. We conclude intrinsically
fainter galaxies have Ly$\alpha$ emission, and there is a steep drop in the LAE fraction from our
high-redshift sample at $z\sim6.5$ and from similar galaxies at $z\sim7.5$. This likely indicates
we are witnessing the tail end of the epoch of reionization, as such a drop is not expected due to changes
of intrinsic galaxy properties between these redshifts.
