[Abridged] Although galaxies are found to follow a tight relation between their star formation
rate and stellar mass, they are expected to exhibit complex star formation histories (SFH), with
short-term fluctuations. The goal of this pilot study is to present a method that will identify galaxies
that are undergoing a strong variation of star formation activity in the last tens to hundreds Myr.
In other words, the proposed method will determine whether a variation in the last few hundreds of
Myr of the SFH is needed to properly model the SED rather than a smooth normal SFH. To do so, we analyze
a sample of COSMOS galaxies using high signal-to-noise ratio broad band photometry. We apply Approximate
Bayesian Computation, a state-of-the-art statistical method to perform model choice, associated
to machine learning algorithms to provide the probability that a flexible SFH is preferred based
on the observed flux density ratios of galaxies. We present the method and test it on a sample of simulated
SEDs. The input information fed to the algorithm is a set of broadband UV to NIR (rest-frame) flux
ratios for each galaxy. The method has an error rate of 21% in recovering the right SFH and is sensitive
to SFR variations larger than 1 dex. A more traditional SED fitting method using CIGALE is tested
to achieve the same goal, based on fits comparisons through Bayesian Information Criterion but
the best error rate obtained is higher, 28%. We apply our new method to the COSMOS galaxies sample.
The stellar mass distribution of galaxies with a strong to decisive evidence against the smooth
delayed-$\tau$ SFH peaks at lower M* compared to galaxies where the smooth delayed-$\tau$ SFH is
preferred. We discuss the fact that this result does not come from any bias due to our training. Finally,
we argue that flexible SFHs are needed to be able to cover that largest SFR-M* parameter space possible.
