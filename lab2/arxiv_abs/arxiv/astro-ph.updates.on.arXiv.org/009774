The luminous blue variable (LBV) RMC143 is located in the outskirts of the 30~Doradus complex, a
region rich with interstellar material and hot luminous stars. We report the $3\sigma$ sub-millimetre
detection of its circumstellar nebula with ALMA. The observed morphology in the sub-millimetre
is different than previously observed with HST and ATCA in the optical and centimetre wavelength
regimes. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of RMC143 suggests that two emission mechanisms
contribute to the sub-mm emission: optically thin bremsstrahlung and dust. Both the extinction
map and the SED are consistent with a dusty massive nebula with a dust mass of $0.055\pm0.018~M_{\odot}$
(assuming $\kappa_{850}=1.7\rm\,cm^{2}\,g^{-1}$). To date, RMC143 has the most dusty LBV nebula
observed in the Magellanic Clouds. We have also re-examined the LBV classification of RMC143 based
on VLT/X-shooter spectra obtained in 2015/16 and a review of the publication record. The radiative
transfer code CMFGEN is used to derive its fundamental stellar parameters. We find an effective
temperature of $\sim 8500$~K, luminosity of log$(L/L_{\odot}) = 5.32$, and a relatively high mass-loss
rate of $1.0 \times 10^{-5}~M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$. The luminosity is much lower than previously
thought, which implies that the current stellar mass of $\sim8~M_{\odot}$ is comparable to its
nebular mass of $\sim 5.5~M_{\odot}$ (from an assumed gas-to-dust ratio of 100), suggesting that
the star has lost a large fraction of its initial mass in past LBV eruptions or binary interactions.
While the star may have been hotter in the past, it is currently not hot enough to ionize its circumstellar
nebula. We propose that the nebula is ionized externally by the hot stars in the 30~Doradus star-forming
region.
