The first, long awaited, detection of a gravitational wave (GW) signal from the merger of a binary
neutron-star (NS-NS) system was finally achieved, and was also accompanied by an electromagnetic
counterpart - the short-duration GRB 170817A. It occurred in the nearby ($D\approx40\;$Mpc) elliptical
galaxy NGC$\,$4993, and showed optical, IR and UV emission from half a day up to weeks after the event,
as well as late time X-ray (at $\geq 9\;$days) and radio (at $\geq 17\;$days) emission. There was
a delay of $\Delta t \approx 1.74\;$s between the GW merger chirp signal and the prompt-GRB emission
onset, and an upper limit of $\theta_{\rm obs}<28^\circ$ was set on the viewing angle w.r.t the jet's
symmetry axis from the GW signal. In this letter we examine some of the implications of these groundbreaking
observations. The delay $\Delta t$ sets an upper limit on the prompt-GRB emission radius, $R_\gamma\lesssim
2c\Delta t/(\theta_{\rm obs}-\theta_0)^2$, for a jet with sharp edges at an angle $\theta_0<\theta_{\rm
obs}$. GRB 170817A's relatively low isotropic equivalent $\gamma$-ray energy-output and peak
$\nu F_\nu$ photon energy suggest either a viewing angle slightly outside the jet's sharp edge,
$\theta_{\rm obs}-\theta_0\sim(0.05-0.1)(100/\Gamma)$, or that the jet does not have sharp
edges and the prompt emission was dominated by less energetic material along our line of sight, at
$\theta_{\rm obs}\gtrsim 2\theta_0$. Finally, we consider the type of remnant that is produced
by the NS-NS merger and find that a relatively long-lived ($>2\;$s) massive NS is strongly disfavored,
while a hyper-massive NS of lifetime $\sim1\;$s appears to be somewhat favored over the direct formation
of a black hole.
