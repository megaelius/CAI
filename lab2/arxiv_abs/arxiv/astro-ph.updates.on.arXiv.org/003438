The streaming instability is often invoked as solution to the fragmentation and drift barriers
in planetesimal formation, catalyzing the aggregation of dust on kyr timescales to grow km-sized
cores. However there remains a lack of consensus on the physical mechanism(s) responsible for initiating
it. One potential avenue is disc photoevaporation, wherein the preferential removal of relatively
dust-free gas increases the disc metallicity. Late in the disc lifetime, photoevaporation dominates
viscous accretion, creating a gradient in the depleted gas surface density near the location of
the gap. This induces a local pressure maximum that collects drifting dust particles, which may
then become susceptible to the streaming instability. Using a one-dimensional viscous evolution
model of a disc subject to internal X-ray photoevaporation, we explore the efficacy of this process
to build planetestimals. Over a range of parameters we find that the amount of dust mass converted
into planetesimals is often < 1 M_Earth and at most a few M_Earth spread across tens of AU. We conclude
that photoevaporation may at best be relevant for the formation of debris discs, rather than a common
mechanism for the formation of planetary cores. Our results are in contrast to a recent, similar
investigation that considered an FUV-driven photoevaporation model and reported the formation
of tens of M_Earth at large (> 100 AU) disc radii. The discrepancies are primarily a consequence of
the different photoevaporation profiles assumed. Until observations more tightly constrain
photoevaporation models, the relevance of this process to the formation of planets remains uncertain.
