We measure the radial profiles of the stellar velocity dispersions, $\sigma(R)$, for 85 early-type
galaxies (ETGs) in the MASSIVE survey, a volume-limited integral-field spectroscopic (IFS) galaxy
survey targeting all northern-sky ETGs with absolute $K$-band magnitude $M_K < -25.3$ mag, or stellar
mass $M_* > 4 \times 10^{11} M_\odot$, within 108 Mpc. Our wide-field 107" $\times$ 107" IFS data
cover radii as large as 40 kpc, for which we quantify separately the inner ($<5$ kpc) and outer logarithmic
slopes $\gamma_{\rm inner}$ and $\gamma_{\rm outer}$ of $\sigma(R)$. While $\gamma_{\rm inner}$
is mostly negative, of the 61 galaxies with sufficient radial coverage to determine $\gamma_{\rm
outer}$ we find 33% to have rising outer dispersion profiles ($\gamma_{\rm outer} > 0.03$), 13%
to be flat ($-0.03 < \gamma_{\rm outer} < 0.03$), and 54% to be falling. The fraction of galaxies with
rising outer profiles increases with $M_*$ and in denser galaxy environment, with the 11 most massive
galaxies in our sample all having flat or rising dispersion profiles. The strongest environmental
correlation is with halo mass, but weaker correlations with large-scale density and local density
also exist. The average $\gamma_{\rm outer}$ is similar for brightest group galaxies, satellites,
and isolated galaxies in our sample. We find a clear positive correlation between the gradients
of the outer dispersion profile and the gradients of the velocity kurtosis $h_4$. Altogether, our
kinematic results suggest that the increasing fraction of rising dispersion profiles in the most
massive ETGs are caused (at least in part) by variations in the total mass profiles rather than in
the velocity anisotropy alone.
