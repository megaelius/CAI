X-ray observations play a crucial role in understanding the emission mechanism and relevant physical
phenomena of magnetars. We report X-ray observations of a young magnetar SGR 1900+14 made in 2016,
which is famous for a giant flare in 1998 August. Simultaneous observations were conducted with
XMM-Newton and NuSTAR on 2016 October 20 with 23 and 123 ks exposures, respectively. The NuSTAR hard
X-ray coverage enabled us to detect the source up to 70 keV. The 1-10 keV and 15-60 keV fluxes were $3.11(3)\times10^{-12}\;{\rm
erg\;s^{-1}\;cm^{-2}}$ and $6.8(3)\times10^{-12}\;{\rm erg\;s^{-1}\;cm^{-2}}$, respectively.
The 1-70 keV spectra were well fitted by a blackbody plus power-law model with a surface temperature
of $kT=0.52(2)\;{\rm keV}$, a photon index of the hard power-law of $\Gamma=1.21(6)$, and a column
density of $N_{\rm H}=1.96(11)\times10^{22}\;{\rm cm^{-2}}$. Compared with previous observations
with Suzaku in 2006 and 2009, the 1-10 keV flux showed a decrease by 25-40%, while the spectral shape
did not show any significant change with differences of $kT$ and $N_{\rm H}$ being within 10% of each
other. Through timing analysis, we found that the rotation period of SGR 1900+14 on 2016 October
20 was $5.22669(3)\;{\rm s}$. The long-term evolution of the rotation period shows a monotonic
decrease in the spin-down rate $\dot{P}$ lasting for more than 15 years. We also found a characteristic
behavior of the hard-tail power-law component of SGR 1900+14. The energy-dependent pulse profiles
vary in morphology with a boundary of 10 keV. The phase-resolved spectra show the differences between
photon indices ($\Gamma=1.02$-$1.44$) as a function of the pulse phase. Furthermore, the photon
index is positively correlated with the X-ray flux of the hard power-law component, which could
not be resolved by the previous hard X-ray observations.
