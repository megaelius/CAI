Two-episode emission components separated by quiescent gaps in the prompt emission of gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) have been observed in the {\em Swift} era, but there is a lack of spectral information
due to the narrow energy band of the {\em Swift}/Burst Alert Telescope. In this paper, a systematic
analysis of the spectral and temporal properties of the prompt emission of 101 {\em Fermi}/Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor detected long GRBs show the existence of two-episode emission components in the light
curves, with quiescent times of up to hundreds of seconds. We focus on investigating the differences
of those two emission episodes. We find that the light curves of the two emission components exhibit
different behavior, e.g., a soft emission component that either precedes or follows the main prompt
emission or that the intensity of the two emission episodes are comparable with each other. No statistically
significant correlation in the duration of the two emission episodes can be claimed. We define a
new parameter $\varepsilon$ as the ratio of the peak flux of the first and second emission episodes
and find that a higher $\varepsilon$ corresponds to a larger fluence. The preferred spectral model
in our analysis is a cutoff power-law model for most GRBs. The distribution of $E_p$ for episodes
I and II range from tens of keV to 1000 keV with a lognormal fit and there are no significant differences
between them. Moreover, we do not find significant relationships between $\varepsilon$ and $E_p$
for the two emission episodes. Those results suggest that these two-episode emission components
likely share the same physical origin.
