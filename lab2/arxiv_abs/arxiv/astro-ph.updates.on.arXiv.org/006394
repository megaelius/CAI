We present a suite of ALMA interferometric molecular line and continuum images that elucidate,
on linear size scales of $\sim$30--40 AU, the chemical structure of the nearby, evolved, protoplanetary
disk orbiting the close binary system V4046 Sgr. The observations were undertaken in the 1.1--1.4
mm wavelength range (ALMA Bands 6 and 7) with antenna configurations involving maximum baselines
of several hundred meters, yielding subarcsecond-resolution images in more than a dozen molecular
species and isotopologues. Isotopologues of CO and HCN display centrally peaked morphologies
of integrated emission line intensity, whereas the line emission from complex nitrile group molecules
(HC$_3$N, CH$_3$CN), deuterated molecules (DCN, DCO$^+$), hydrocarbons (as traced by C$_2$H),
and potential CO ice line tracers (N$_2$H$^+$, and H$_2$CO) appears as a sequence of sharp and diffuse
rings. The dimensions and morphologies of HC$_3$N and CH$_3$CN emission are suggestive of photodesorption
of organic ices from the surfaces of dust grains, while the sequence of increasing radius of peak
intensity represented by DCN (smallest), DCO$^+$, N$_2$H$^+$, and H$_2$CO (largest) is qualitatively
consistent with the expected decline of midplane gas temperature with increasing disk radius.
Empirical modeling indicates that the sharp-edged C$_2$H emission ring lies at relatively deep
disk layers, leaving open the question of the origin of C$_2$H abundance enhancements in evolved
disks. This study of the "molecular anatomy" of V4046 Sgr should serve as motivation for additional
subarcsecond ALMA molecular line imaging surveys of nearby, evolved protoplanetary disks aimed
at addressing major uncertainties in protoplanetary disk physical and chemical structure and
molecular production pathways.
