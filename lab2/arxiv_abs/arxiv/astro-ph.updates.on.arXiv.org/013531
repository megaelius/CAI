We present an open-access database which includes a synthetic catalog of black holes in the Milky
Way. To calculate evolution of single and binary stars we used updated population synthesis code
StarTrack. We applied a new model of star formation history and chemical evolution of Galactic disk,
bulge and halo synthesized from observational and theoretical data. We find that at the current
moment Milky Way (disk+bulge+halo) contains about 1.2 x 10^8 single black holes with average mass
of about 14 Msun and 9.3 x 10^6 BHs in binary systems with average mass of 19 Msun. We present basic statistical
properties of BH populations such as distributions of single and binary BH masses, velocities,
orbital parameters or numbers of BH binary systems in different evolutionary configurations.
We find that the most massive BHs are formed in mergers of binary systems, such as BH-MS, BH+He, BH-BH.
The metallicity of stellar population has a significant impact on the final BH mass due to the stellar
winds. Therefore the most massive single BH in our simulation, 113 Msun, originates from a merger
of a helium star and a black hole in a low metallicity stellar environment in Galactic halo. The most
massive BH in binary system is 60 Msun and was also formed in Galactic halo. We constrain that only
0.006% of total Galactic halo mass (including dark matter) could be hidden in the form of stellar
origin BHs which are not detectable by current observational surveys. Galactic binary BHs are minority
(10% of all Galactic BHs) and most of them are in BH-BH systems. The current Galactic merger rates
for two considered common envelope models which are: 3-81 Myr^-1 for BH-BH, 1-9 Myr^-1, for BH-NS
and 14-59 Myr^-1 for NS-NS systems. Data files are available at https://bhc.syntheticuniverse.org/.
