Previous estimates of the solar flare abundances of Si, S, Cl, Ar, and K from the RESIK X-ray crystal
spectrometer on board the {\em CORONAS-F} spacecraft were made on the assumption of isothermal
X-ray emission. We investigate the effect on these estimates by relaxing this assumption and instead
determining the differential emission measure (DEM) or thermal structure of the emitting plasma
by re-analyzing RESIK data for a {\em GOES} class M1.0 flare on 2002 November~14 (SOL2002-11-14T22:26)
for which there was good data coverage. The analysis method uses a maximum-likelihood (Withbroe--Sylwester)
routine for evaluating the DEM. In a first step, called here AbuOpt, an optimized set of abundances
of Si, S, Ar, and K is found that is consistent with the observed spectra. With these abundances, the
differential emission measure evolution during the flare is found. The abundance optimization
leads to revised abundances of silicon and sulfur in the flare plasma: $A({\rm S}) = 6.94 \pm 0.06$
and $A({\rm Si}) = 7.56 \pm 0.08$ (on a logarithmic scale with $A({\rm H}) = 12$). Previously determined
abundances of Ar, K, and Cl from an isothermal assumption are still the preferred values. During
the flare's maximum phase, the X-ray-emitting plasma has a basically two-temperature structure,
with the cooler plasma with approximately constant temperature (3--6~MK) and a hotter plasma with
temperature $16-21$~MK. Using imaging data from the {\em RHESSI} hard X-ray spacecraft, the emission
volume of the hot plasma is deduced from which lower limits of the electron density $N_e$ and the thermal
content of the plasma are given.
