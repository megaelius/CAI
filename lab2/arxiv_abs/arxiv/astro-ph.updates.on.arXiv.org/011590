Future space telescopes may be able to directly image $\sim$10 - 100 planets with sizes and orbits
consistent with habitable surface conditions ("exo-Earth candidates" or EECs), but observers
will face difficulty in distinguishing these from the potentially hundreds of non-habitable "false
positives" which will also be detected. To maximize the efficiency of follow-up observations,
a prioritization scheme must be developed to determine which planets are most likely to be EECs.
In this paper, we present a Bayesian method for estimating the likelihood that any directly imaged
extrasolar planet is a true exo-Earth candidate by interpreting the planet's apparent magnitude
and separation in light of existing exoplanet statistics. As a specific application of this general
framework, we use published estimates of the discovery yield of future space-based direct imaging
mission concepts to conduct "mock surveys" in which we compute the likelihood that each detected
planet is an EEC. We find that it will be difficult to determine which planets are EECs with $>50\%$
confidence using single-band photometry immediately upon their detection. The best way to reduce
this ambiguity would be to constrain the planet's orbit by revisiting the system multiple times
or through a radial velocity precursor survey. Astrometric or radial velocity constraints on the
planet's mass would offer a lesser benefit. Finally, we show that a Bayesian approach to prioritizing
targets would improve the follow-up efficiency of a direct imaging survey versus a blind approach
using the same data. For example, the prioritized approach could reduce the amount of integration
time required for the spectral detection (or rejection) of water absorption in most EECs by a factor
of two.
