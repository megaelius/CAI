Despite indications that superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) originate from massive progenitors,
the lack of a uniformly analyzed statistical sample has so far prevented a detailed view of the progenitor
mass distribution. Here we present and analyze the pre-explosion mass distribution of hydrogen-poor
SLSN progenitors as determined from uniformly modelled light curves of 62 events. We construct
the distribution by summing the ejecta mass posteriors of each event, using magnetar light curve
models presented in our previous works (and using a nominal neutron star remnant mass). The resulting
distribution spans $3.6-40$ M$_{\odot}$, with a sharp decline at lower masses, and is best fit by
a broken power law described by ${\rm d}N/{\rm dlog}M \propto M^{-0.41 \pm 0.06}$ at $3.6-8.6$ M$_{\odot}$
and $\propto M^{-1.26 \pm 0.06}$ at $8.6-40$ M$_{\odot}$. We find that observational selection
effects cannot account for the shape of the distribution. Relative to Type Ib/c SNe, the SLSN mass
distribution extends to much larger masses and has a different power-law shape, likely indicating
that the formation of a magnetar allows more massive stars to explode as some of the rotational energy
accelerates the ejecta. Comparing the SLSN distribution with predictions from single and binary
star evolution models, we find that binary models for a metallicity of $Z\lesssim 1/3$ Z$_{\odot}$
are best able to reproduce its broad shape, in agreement with the preference of SLSNe for low metallicity
environments. Finally, we uncover a correlation between the pre-explosion mass and the magnetar
initial spin period, where SLSNe with low masses have slower spins, a trend broadly consistent with
the effects of angular momentum transport evident in models of rapidly-rotating carbon-oxygen
stars.
