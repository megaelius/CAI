Context. The progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) have not yet been well identified. The
most popular model is the merger of compact object binaries (NS-NS/NS-BH). However, other progenitor
models cannot be ruled out. The delay-time distribution of SGRB progenitors, which is an important
property to constrain progenitor models, is still poorly understood. Aims. We aim to better constrain
the luminosity function of SGRBs and the delay-time distribution of their progenitors with newly
discovered SGRBs. Methods. We present a low-contamination sample of 16 Swift SGRBs that is better
defined by a duration shorter than 0.8 s. By using this robust sample and by combining a self-consistent
star formation model with various models for the distribution of time delays, the redshift distribution
of SGRBs is calculated and then compared to the observational data. Results. We find that the power-law
delay distribution model is disfavored and that only the lognormal delay distribution model with
the typical delay tau >= 3 Gyr is consistent with the data. Comparing Swift SGRBs with T90 >
0.8 s to our robust sample (T90 < 0.8 s), we find a significant difference in the time delays between
these two samples. Conclusions. Our results show that the progenitors of SGRBs are dominated by
relatively long-lived systems (tau >= 3 Gyr), which contrasts the results found for Type Ia supernovae.
We therefore conclude that primordial NS-NS systems are not favored as the dominant SGRB progenitors.
Alternatively, dynamically formed NS-NS/BH and primordial NS-BH systems with average delays
longer than 5 Gyr may contribute a significant fraction to the overall SGRB progenitors.
