In modern weak-lensing surveys, the common approach to correct for residual systematic biases
in the shear is to calibrate shape measurement algorithms using simulations. These simulations
must fully capture the complexity of the observations to avoid introducing any additional bias.
In this paper we study the importance of faint galaxies below the observational detection limit
of a survey. We simulate simplified Euclid VIS images including and excluding this faint population,
and measure the shift in the multiplicative shear bias between the two sets of simulations. We measure
the shear with three different algorithms: a moment-based approach, model fitting, and machine
learning. We find that for all methods, a spatially uniform random distribution of faint galaxies
introduces a shear multiplicative bias of the order of a few times $10^{-3}$. This value increases
to the order of $10^{-2}$ when including the clustering of the faint galaxies, as measured in the
Hubble Space Telescope Ultra-Deep Field. The magnification of the faint background galaxies due
to the brighter galaxies along the line of sight is found to have a negligible impact on the multiplicative
bias. We conclude that the undetected galaxies must be included in the calibration simulations
with proper clustering properties down to magnitude 28 in order to reach a residual uncertainty
on the multiplicative shear bias calibration of a few times $10^{-4}$, in line with the $2\times10^{-3}$
total accuracy budget required by the scientific objectives of the Euclid survey. We propose two
complementary methods for including faint galaxy clustering in the calibration simulations.
