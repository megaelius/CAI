NASA's Parker Solar Probe (Parker) spacecraft reached its first perihelion of 35.7 solar radii
on November 5th, 2018. To aid in mission planning, and in anticipation of the unprecedented measurements
to be returned, in late October, we developed a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solution
for the solar corona and inner heliosphere, driven by the then available observations of the Sun's
photospheric magnetic field. Our model incorporates a wave-turbulence-driven (WTD) model to
heat the corona. Here, we present our predictions for the structure of the solar corona and the likely
{\it in situ} measurements that Parker will be returning over the next few months. We infer that,
in the days prior to 1st Encounter, Parker was immersed in wind emanating from a positive-polarity
equatorial coronal hole. During the encounter, however, field lines from the spacecraft mapped
to another, negative-polarity equatorial coronal hole. Following the encounter, Parker was magnetically
connected to the large, positive-polarity northern polar coronal hole. When the Parker data become
available, these model results can be used to assist in their calibration and interpretation, and,
additionally, provide a global context for interpreting the localized {\it in situ} measurements.
In particular, we can identify what types of solar wind Parker encountered, what the underlying
magnetic structure was, and how complexities in the orbital trajectory can be interpreted within
a global, inertial frame. Ultimately, the measurements returned by Parker can be used to constrain
current theories for heating the solar corona and accelerating the solar wind.
