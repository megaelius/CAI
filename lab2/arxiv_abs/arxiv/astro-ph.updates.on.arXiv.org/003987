Radio astronomy observational facilities are under constant upgradation and development to achieve
better capabilities including increasing the time and frequency resolutions of the recorded data,
and increasing the receiving and recording bandwidth. As only a limited spectrum resource has been
allocated to radio astronomy by the International Telecommunication Union, this results in the
radio observational instrumentation being inevitably exposed to undesirable radio frequency
interference (RFI) signals which originate mainly from terrestrial human activity and are becoming
stronger with time. RFIs degrade the quality of astronomical data and even lead to data loss. The
impact of RFIs on scientific outcome is becoming progressively difficult to manage. In this article,
we motivate the requirement for RFI mitigation, and review the RFI characteristics, mitigation
techniques and strategies. Mitigation strategies adopted at some representative observatories,
telescopes and arrays are also introduced. We also discuss and present advantages and shortcomings
of the four classes of RFI mitigation strategies, applicable at the connected causal stages: preventive,
pre-detection, pre-correlation and post-correlation. The proper identification and flagging
of RFI is key to the reduction of data loss and improvement in data quality, and is also the ultimate
goal of developing RFI mitigation techniques. This can be achieved through a strategy involving
a combination of the discussed techniques in stages. Recent advances in high speed digital signal
processing and high performance computing allow for performing RFI excision of large data volumes
generated from large telescopes or arrays in both real time and offline modes, aiding the proposed
strategy.
