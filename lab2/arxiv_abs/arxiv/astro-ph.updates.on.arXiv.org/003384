Future high-sensitivity measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies
and energy spectrum will be limited by our understanding and modeling of foregrounds. Not only does
more information need to be gathered and combined, but also novel approaches for the modeling of
foregrounds, commensurate with the vast improvements in sensitivity, have to be explored. Here,
we study the inevitable effects of spatial averaging on the spectral shapes of typical foreground
components, introducing a moment approach, which naturally extends the list of foreground parameters
that have to be determined through measurements or constrained by theoretical models. Foregrounds
are thought of as a superposition of individual emitting volume elements along the line of sight
and across the sky, which then are observed through an instrumental beam. The beam and line of sight
averages are inevitable. Instead of assuming a specific model for the distributions of physical
parameters, our method identifies natural new spectral shapes for each foreground component that
can be used to extract parameter moments (e.g., mean, dispersion, cross-terms, etc.). The method
is illustrated for the superposition of power-laws, free-free spectra, gray-body and modified
blackbody spectra, but can be applied to more complicated fundamental spectral energy distributions.
Here, we focus on intensity signals but the method can be extended to the case of polarized emission.
The averaging process automatically produces scale-dependent spectral shapes and the moment
method can be used to propagate the required information across scales in power spectrum estimates.
The approach is not limited to applications to CMB foregrounds but could also be useful for the modeling
of X-ray emission in clusters of galaxies.
