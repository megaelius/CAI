The HII regions are all studied employing the same general prescriptions, despite the possible
influence of their environment in their star formation processes. Through the analysis of two samples
of 725 inner and 671 outer disk HII region observed spectra, we explore possible systematic differences
between their ionising clusters physical properties (metallicity, mass, and age), comparing
observations and predictions by photoionisation models. Higher metallicities are confirmed
for inner regions, although there are important discrepancies between the diagnostic diagrams.
Calibrations based on the N2 index may underestimate inner regions O/H due to the [NII] saturation
at solar metallicities. The degeneracy between the age and ionisation parameter affects O/H calibrations
based on the O3N2 index. Innermost regions have enhanced N/O ratios, indicating an increase in the
slope of the relation between N/O and O/H. Ionisation parameter calibrations based on the [SII]/H{\alpha}
ratio are not valid for inner regions due to the bivalued behaviour of this ratio with O/H. Innermost
regions have lower [OII]/[OIII] ratios than expected, indicating a possible non-linear relation
between u and Z. Ionising and non-ionising populations are present in both inner and outer regions.
Inner regions show larger ionising cluster masses that possibly compose star-forming complexes.
Outer regions might be affected by stochastic effects. Equivalent widths indicate younger ages
for outer regions, but degeneracy between evolution and underlying population effects prevent
a quantitative determination. Inner regions have larger angular sizes, lower filling factors,
and larger ionised hydrogen masses. The confirmed systematic differences between ionising clusters
of inner and outer HII regions condition the validity and range of reliability of O/H and u calibrations
commonly applied to the study of HII regions.
