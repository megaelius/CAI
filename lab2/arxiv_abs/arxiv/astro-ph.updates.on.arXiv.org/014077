The edges of ionized (HII) regions are important sites for the formation of (high-mass) stars. Indeed,
at least 30% of the galactic high mass star formation is observed there. The radiative and compressive
impact of the HII region could induce the star formation at the border following different mechanisms
such as the Collect & Collapse (C&C) or the Radiation Driven Implosion (RDI) models and change their
properties. We study the properties of two zones located in the Photo Dissociation Region (PDR)
of the Galactic HII region RCW120 and discussed them as a function of the physical conditions and
young star contents found in both clumps. Using the APEX telescope, we mapped two regions of size
1.5'$\times$1.5' toward the most massive clump of RCW120 hosting young massive sources and toward
a clump showing a protrusion inside the HII region and hosting more evolved low-mass sources. The
$^{12}$CO($J=3-2$), $^{13}$CO($J=3-2$) and C$^{18}$O($J=3-2$) lines are used to derive the
properties and dynamics of these clumps. We discuss their relation with the hosted star-formation.
The increase of velocity dispersion and $T_{ex}$ are found toward the center of the maps, where star-formation
is observed with Herschel. Furthermore, both regions show supersonic Mach number. No strong evidences
have been found concerning the impact of far ultraviolet (FUV) radiation on C$^{18}$O photodissociation.
The fragmentation time needed for the C&C to be at work is equivalent to the dynamical age of RCW120
and the properties of region B are in agreement with bright-rimmed clouds. It strengthens the fact
that, together with evidences of compression, C&C might be at work at the edges of RCW120. Additionally,
the clump located at the eastern part of the PDR is a good candidate of pre-existing clump where star-formation
may be induced by the RDI mechanism.
