Recent observations show that the CO gas abundance, relative to H$_2$, in many 1-10 Myr old protoplanetary
disks may be heavily depleted, by a factor of 10-100 compared to the canonical interstellar medium
value of 10$^{-4}$. When and how this depletion happens can significantly affect compositions
of planetesimals and atmospheres of giant planets. It is therefore important to constrain if the
depletion occurs already at the earliest protostellar disk stage. Here we present spatially resolved
observations of C$^{18}$O, C$^{17}$O, and $^{13}$C$^{18}$O $J$=2-1 lines in three protostellar
disks. We show that the C$^{18}$O line emits from both the disk and the inner envelope, while C$^{17}$O
and $^{13}$C$^{18}$O lines are consistent with a disk origin. The line ratios indicate that both
C$^{18}$O and C$^{17}$O lines are optically thick in the disk region, and only $^{13}$C$^{18}$O
line is optically thin. The line profiles of the $^{13}$C$^{18}$O emissions are best reproduced
by Keplerian gaseous disks at similar sizes as their mm-continuum emissions, suggesting small
radial separations between the gas and mm-sized grains in these disks, in contrast to the large separation
commonly seen in protoplanetary disks. Assuming a gas-to-dust ratio of 100, we find that the CO gas
abundances in these protostellar disks are consistent with the ISM abundance within a factor of
2, nearly one order of magnitude higher than the average value of 1-10 Myr old disks. These results
suggest that there is a fast, $\sim$1 Myr, evolution of the abundance of CO gas from the protostellar
disk stage to the protoplanetary disk stage.
