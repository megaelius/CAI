We examine the photometric data for Fornax clusters, focussing our attention on their horizontal
branch color distribution and, when available, on the RR Lyr variables fraction and period distribution.
Based on our understanding of the HB morphology in terms of varying helium content in the context
of multiple stellar generations, we show that clusters F2, F3 and F5 must contain substantial fractions
of second generation stars (~54-65%). On the basis of a simple chemical evolution model we show that
the helium distribution in these clusters can be reproduced by models with cluster initial masses
ranging from values equal to ~4 to ~10 times larger than the current masses. Models with a very short
second generation star formation episode can also reproduce the observed helium distribution
but require larger initial masses up to about twenty times the current mass. While the lower limit
of this range of possible initial GC masses is consistent with those suggested by the observations
of the low metallicity field stars, we also discuss the possibility that the metallicity scale of
field stars (based on CaII triplet spectroscopy) and the metallicities derived for the clusters
in Fornax may not be consistent with each other. The reproduction of the HB morphology in F2,F3,F5
requires two interesting hypotheses: 1) the first generation HB stars lie all at "red" colours.
According to this interpretation, the low metallicity stars in the field of Fornax, populating
the HB at colours bluer than the blue side ((V-I)o<=0.3 or (B-V)o<=0.2) of the RR Lyrs, should
be second generation stars born in the clusters;a preliminary analysis of available colour surveys
of Fornax field provides a fraction ~20% of blue HB stars, in the low metallicity range; 2) the mass
loss from individual second generation red giants is a few percent of a solar mass larger than the
mass loss from first generation stars.
