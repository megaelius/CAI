Young (<1Gyr) exoplanets represent a critically important area of exoplanet research, as they
offer the opportunity to learn about the formation and early dynamic history of exoplanetary systems.
However, finding young exoplanets is significantly complicated by the fast rotation and complex
activity of their young host stars, which are often not well handled by state-of-the-art automatic
pipelines. This work presents an alternative LOWESS-based pipeline focused specifically on detrending
young stellar light-curves from the 30min-cadence Full Frame Images (FFIs) produced by the Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite ($TESS$), and includes improvements such as automatic peak-cutting
of stellar variability and interpolation over masked transits to improve periodogram visibility
and returned transit shapes. This work presents the details of the developed pipeline, along with
initial results from its application to young stars within stellar associations in sectors 1-5
of the $TESS$ data. While no new exoplanet candidate signals were found in this work, interesting
results included the recovery of all known 2min TOIs around young stars in sectors 1-5 from 30min
data alone, the recovery of the young exoplanet DS Tuc Ab, a number of young eclipsing binaries and
a wide array of interesting rotation. A sensitivity analysis was also undertaken for each star,
showing how recovery of injected planets varied with both depth and period for each individual target.
Challenges for future searches for young exoplanets are discussed, the largest being stellar rotation
with periods less than 1 day and a lack of a large sample of confirmed young stars.
