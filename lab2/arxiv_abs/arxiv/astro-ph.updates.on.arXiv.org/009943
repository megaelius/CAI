We study the spin alignment of galaxies and halos with respect to filaments and walls of the cosmic
web, identified with DisPerSE, using the SIMBA simulation from z=0-2. Massive halos' spins are
oriented perpendicularly to their closest filament's axis and walls, while low mass halos tend
to have their spins parallel to filaments and in the plane of walls. A similar mass-dependent spin
flip is found for galaxies, albeit with a weaker signal particularly at low mass and low-z, suggesting
that galaxies' spins retain memory of their larger-scale environment. Low-z star-forming and
rotation-dominated galaxies tend to have spins parallel to nearby filaments, while quiescent
and dispersion-dominated galaxies show preferentially perpendicular orientation; the star
formation trend can be fully explained by the stellar mass correlation, but the morphology trend
cannot. There is a strong dependence on HI mass, such that high-HI galaxies tend to have parallel
spins while low-HI galaxies are perpendicular, which persists even when matching samples in stellar
mass, suggesting that HI content traces anisotropic infall more faithfully than the stellar component.
Finally, at fixed stellar mass, the strength of spin alignments correlates with the filament's
density, with parallel alignment for galaxies in high density environments. These findings are
consistent with conditional tidal torque theory, and highlight a significant correlation between
galactic spin and the larger scale tides that are important e.g. for interpreting weak lensing studies.
SIMBA allows us to rule out numerical grid locking as the cause of previously-seen low mass alignment.
