We perform a suite of 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations of photoevaporation of molecular
gas clumps illuminated by external massive stars. We study the fate of solar-mass clumps and derive
their lifetimes with varying the gas metallicity over a range of $10^{-3} \,Z_\odot \leq Z \leq Z_\odot
$. Our simulations incorporate radiation transfer of far ultraviolet (FUV) and extreme ultraviolet
(EUV) photons, and follow atomic/molecular line cooling and dust-gas collisional cooling. Nonequilibrium
chemistry is coupled with the radiative transfer and hydrodynamics in a self-consistent manner.
We show that radiation-driven shocks compress gas clumps to have a volume that is set by the pressure-equilibrium
with the hot ambient gas. Radiative cooling enables metal-rich clumps to condense and to have small
surface areas, where photoevaporative flows are launched. For our fiducial set-up with an O-type
star at a distance of 0.1 parsec, the resulting photoevaporation rate is as small as $\sim 10^{-5}
M_{\odot}/{\rm yr}$ for metal-rich clumps, but is larger for metal-poor clumps that have larger
surface areas. The clumps are continuously accelerated away from the radiation source by the so-called
rocket effect, and can travel over $\sim$1 parsec within the lifetime. We also study photoevaporation
of clumps in a photo-dissociation region. Photoelectric heating is inefficient for metal-poor
clumps that contain a smaller amount of grains, and thus they survive for over $10^5$ years. We conclude
that the gas metallicity strongly affects the clump lifetime and thus determines the strength of
feedback from massive stars in star-forming regions.
