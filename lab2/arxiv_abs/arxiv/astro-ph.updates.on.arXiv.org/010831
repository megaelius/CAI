We analytically derive the observed size-mass relation of galaxies' atomic hydrogen (HI), including
limits on its scatter, based on simple assumptions about the structure of HI discs. We trial three
generic profiles for HI surface density as a function of radius. Firstly, we assert that HI surface
densities saturate at a variable threshold, and otherwise fall off exponentially with radius or,
secondly, radius squared. Our third model assumes the total gas surface density is exponential,
with the HI fraction at each radius depending on local pressure. These are tested against a compilation
of 110 galaxies from the THINGS, LITTLE THINGS, LVHIS, and Bluedisk surveys, whose HI surface density
profiles are well resolved. All models fit the observations well and predict consistent size-mass
relations. Using an analytical argument, we explain why processes that cause gas disc truncation
- such as ram-pressure stripping - scarcely affect the HI size-mass relation. This is tested with
the IllustrisTNG(100) cosmological, hydrodynamic simulation and the Dark Sage semi-analytic
model of galaxy formation, both of which capture radially resolved disc structure. For galaxies
with m_*>10^9 M_solar and m_HI>10^8 M_solar, both simulations predict HI size-mass relations
that align with observations, show no difference between central and satellite galaxies, and show
only a minor, second-order dependence on host halo mass for satellites. Ultimately, the universally
tight HI size-mass relation is mathematically inevitable and robust. Only by completely disrupting
the structure of HI discs, e.g. through overly powerful feedback, could a simulation predict the
relation poorly.
