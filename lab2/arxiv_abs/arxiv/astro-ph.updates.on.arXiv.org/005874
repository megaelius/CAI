Stacked lensing is a powerful means of measuring the average mass distribution around large-scale
structure tracers. There are two stacked lensing estimators used in the literature, denoted as
$\Delta\Sigma$ and $\gamma_+$, which are related as $\Delta\Sigma=\Sigma_{\rm cr}\gamma_+$,
where $\Sigma_{\rm cr}(z_l,z_s)$ is the critical surface mass density for each lens-source pair
($z_l$ and $z_s$ are lens and source redshifts, respectively). In this paper we derive a formula
for the covariance matrix of $\Delta\Sigma$-estimator focusing on `weight' function to improve
the signal-to-noise ($S/N$). We assume that the lensing fields and the distribution of lensing
objects obey the Gaussian statistics. With this formula, we show that, if background galaxy shapes
are weighted by an amount of $\Sigma_{\rm cr}^{-2}(z_l,z_s)$, the $\Delta\Sigma$-estimator
maximizes the $S/N$ in the shot noise limited regime. We also show that the $\Delta\Sigma$-estimator
with the weight $\Sigma_{\rm cr}^{-2}$ gives a greater $(S/N)^2$ than that of the $\gamma_+$-estimator
by about 5--25\% for lensing objects at redshifts comparable with or higher than the median of source
galaxy redshifts for hypothetical Subaru HSC and DES surveys. However, for low-redshift lenses
such as $z_l<0.3$, the $\gamma_+$-estimator has higher $(S/N)^2$ than $\Delta\Sigma$. We also
discuss that the $(S/N)^2$ for $\Delta\Sigma$ at large separations in the sample variance limited
regime can be boosted, by up to a factor of 1.5, if one adopts a weight of $\Sigma_{\rm cr}^{-\alpha}$
with $\alpha>2$. Our formula allows one to explore how the combination of the different estimators
can approach an optimal estimator in all regimes of redshifts and separation scales.
