We study the statistical distribution of satellites around star-forming and quiescent central
galaxies at 1<z<3 using imaging from the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE) and
the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS). The deep near-IR data
select satellites down to $\log(M/M_\odot)>9$ at z<3. The radial satellite distribution
around centrals is consistent with a projected NFW profile. Massive quiescent centrals, $\log(M/M_\odot)>10.78$,
have $\sim$2 times the number of satellites compared to star-forming centrals with a significance
of 2.7$\sigma$ even after accounting for differences in the centrals' stellar-mass distributions.
We find no statistical difference in the satellite distributions of intermediate-mass quiescent
and star-forming centrals, $10.48<\log(M/M_\odot)<10.78$. Comparing to the Guo2011
semi-analytic model, the excess number of satellites indicates that quiescent centrals have halo
masses 0.3 dex larger than star-forming centrals, even when the stellar-mass distributions are
fixed. We use a simple toy model that relates halo mass and quenching, which roughly reproduces the
observed quenched fractions and the differences in halo mass between star-forming and quenched
galaxies only if galaxies have a quenching probability that increases with halo mass from $\sim$0
for $\log(M_h/M_\odot)\sim$11 to $\sim$1 for $\log(M_h/M_\odot)\sim$13.5. A single halo-mass
quenching threshold is unable to reproduce the quiescent fraction and satellite distribution
of centrals. Therefore, while halo quenching may be an important mechanism, it is unlikely to be
the only factor driving quenching. It remains unclear why a high fraction of centrals remain star-forming
even in relatively massive halos.
