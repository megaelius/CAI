The magnetic field shapes the structure of the solar corona but we still know little about the interrelationships
between the coronal magnetic field configurations and the resulting quasi-stationary structures
observed in coronagraphic images (as streamers, plumes, coronal holes). One way to obtain information
on the large-scale structure of the coronal magnetic field is to extrapolate it from photospheric
data and compare the results with coronagraphic images. Our aim is to verify if this comparison can
be a fast method to check systematically the reliability of the many methods available to reconstruct
the coronal magnetic field. Coronal fields are usually extrapolated from photospheric measurements
typically in a region close to the central meridian on the solar disk and then compared with coronagraphic
images at the limbs, acquired at least 7 days before or after to account for solar rotation, implicitly
assuming that no significant changes occurred in the corona during that period. In this work, we
combine images from three coronagraphs (SOHO/LASCO-C2 and the two STEREO/SECCHI-COR1) observing
the Sun from different viewing angles to build Carrington maps covering the entire corona to reduce
the effect of temporal evolution to ~ 5 days. We then compare the position of the observed streamers
in these Carrington maps with that of the neutral lines obtained from four different magnetic field
extrapolations, to evaluate the performances of the latter in the solar corona. Our results show
that the location of coronal streamers can provide important indications to discriminate between
different magnetic field extrapolations.
