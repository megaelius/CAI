The intense radiation emitted by luminous quasars dramatically alters the ionization state of
their surrounding IGM. This so-called proximity effect extends out to tens of Mpc, and manifests
as large coherent regions of enhanced Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest transmission in absorption
spectra of background sightlines. Here we present a novel method based on Ly$\alpha$ forest tomography,
which is capable of mapping these quasar `light echoes' in three dimensions. Using a dense grid (10-100)
of faint ($m_r\approx24.7\,\mathrm{mag}$) background galaxies as absorption probes, one can
measure the ionization state of the IGM in the vicinity of a foreground quasar, yielding detailed
information about the quasar's radiative history and emission geometry. An end-to-end analysis
- combining cosmological hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with a quasar emission model,
realistic estimates of galaxy number densities, and instrument + telescope throughput - is conducted
to explore the feasibility of detecting quasar light echoes. We present a new fully Bayesian statistical
method that allows one to reconstruct quasar light echoes from thousands of individual low S/N transmission
measurements. Armed with this machinery, we undertake an exhaustive parameter study and show that
light echoes can be convincingly detected for luminous ($M_{1450} < -27.5\,\mathrm{mag}$ corresponding
to $m_{1450} < 18.4\,\mathrm{mag}$ at $z\simeq 3.6$) quasars at redshifts $3<z_\mathrm{QSO}<5$,
and that a relative precision better than $20\,\%$ on the quasar age can be achieved for individual
objects, for the expected range of ages between 1 Myr and 100 Myr. The observational requirements
are relatively modest - moderate resolution ($R\gtrsim750$) multi object spectroscopy at low
$\rm{}S/N > 5$ is sufficient, requiring three hour integrations using existing instruments on
8m class telescopes.
