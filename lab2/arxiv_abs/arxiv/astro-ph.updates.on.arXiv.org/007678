We propose a new sequential classification model for astronomical objects based on a recurrent
convolutional neural network (RCNN) which uses sequences of images as inputs. This approach avoids
the computation of light curves or difference images. This is the first time that sequences of images
are used directly for the classification of variable objects in astronomy. The second contribution
of this work is the image simulation process. We generate synthetic image sequences that take into
account the instrumental and observing conditions, obtaining a realistic, set of movies for each
astronomical object. The simulated dataset is used to train our RCNN classifier. This approach
allows us to generate datasets to train and test our RCNN model for different astronomical surveys
and telescopes. We aim at building a simulated dataset whose distribution is close enough to the
real dataset, so that a fine tuning could match the distributions between real and simulated dataset.
To test the RCNN classifier trained with the synthetic dataset, we used real-world data from the
High cadence Transient Survey (HiTS) obtaining an average recall of 85%, improved to 94% after performing
fine tuning with 10 real samples per class. We compare the results of our model with those of a light
curve random forest classifier. The proposed RCNN with fine tuning has a similar performance on
the HiTS dataset compared to the light curve classifier, trained on an augmented training set with
10 real samples per class. The RCNN approach presents several advantages in an alert stream classification
scenario, such as a reduction of the data pre-processing, faster online evaluation and easier performance
improvement using a few real data samples. These results encourage us to use this method for alert
brokers systems that will process alert streams generated by new telescopes such as the Large Synoptic
Survey Telescope.
