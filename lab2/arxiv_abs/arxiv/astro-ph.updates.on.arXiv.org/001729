The $\textit{Herschel}$ DEBRIS, DUNES and GT programmes observed 37 exoplanet host stars within
25 pc at 70, 100 and 160 $\mu$m with the sensitivity to detect far-infrared excess emission at flux
density levels only an order of magnitude greater than that of the Solar system's Edgeworth-Kuiper
belt. Here we present an analysis of that sample, using it to more accurately determine the (possible)
level of dust emission from these exoplanet host stars and thereafter determine the links between
the various components of these exoplanetary systems through statistical analysis. We have fitted
the flux densities measured from recent \textit{Herschel} observations with a simple two parameter
($T_{d}$, $L_{\rm IR}/L_{\star}$) black body model (or to the 3-$\sigma$ upper limits at 100 $\mu$m).
From this uniform approach we calculate the fractional luminosity, radial extent, dust temperature
and disc mass. We then plotted the calculated dust luminosity or upper limits against the stellar
properties, e.g. effective temperature, metallicity, age, and identified correlations between
these parameters. A total of eleven debris discs are identified around the 37 stars in the sample.
An incidence of ten cool debris discs around the Sun-like exoplanet host stars (29 $\pm$ 9 %) is consistent
with the detection rate found by DUNES (20.2 $\pm$ 2.0 %). For the debris disc systems, the dust temperatures
range from 20 to 80 K, and fractional luminosities ($L_{\rm IR}/L_{\star}$) between 2.4 $\times$10$^{-6}$
and 4.1 $\times$10$^{-4}$. In the case of non-detections, we calculated typical 3-$\sigma$ upper
limits to the dust fractional luminosities of a few $\times10^{-6}$. We recover the previously
identified correlation between stellar metallicity and hot Jupiter planets in our data set. We
find a correlation between the increased presence of dust, lower planet masses and lower stellar
metallicities. (abridged)
