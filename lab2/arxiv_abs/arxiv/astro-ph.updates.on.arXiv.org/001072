We study the properties of high degree p-mode oscillations in flaring and dormant ARs and compare
them with those in corresponding quiet regions (QRs) to find the association of mode parameters
with magnetic and flare related activities. Our analysis of several flaring and dormant ARs, showed
strong association of mode amplitude, width and energy with magnetic and flare activities although
their changes are combined effects of foreshortening, filling factor, magnetic activity, flare
activity, and measurement uncertainties. We find that the largest decrease in mode amplitude and
background power of an AR are caused by the angular distance of the AR from the solar disc centre. After
correcting the mode parameters for foreshortening and filling factor, we find that the mode amplitude
of flaring and dormant ARs are smaller than in corresponding QRs, and decreases with increasing
MAI suggesting a larger mode power suppression in ARs with stronger magnetic fields. The mode widths
in ARs are larger than in corresponding QRs and increase with MAI, indicating shorter lifetimes
of modes in ARs than in QRs. The largest decrease (increase) in mode amplitude (mode width) of dormant
ARs is found in the five minute frequency band. The average mode energy of both the flaring and dormant
ARs are smaller than in their corresponding QRs, decreasing with increasing MAI. But the average
mode energy decrease rate in flaring ARs are smaller than in dormant ARs. Also, the increase in mode
width rate in dormant (flaring) ARs is followed by decrease (increase) in amplitude variation rate.
Furthermore, inclusion of mode corrections for MAI shows that mode amplitude and mode energy of
flaring ARs increase with FI while mode width shows an opposite trend. The increase (decrease) in
mode amplitude (width) is larger in the five minute and higher frequency band. Increase in width
variation rate is ...
