The current study was developed to provide a database of relatively simple numerical simulations
of protostellar collapse, as a template library for observations of cores and very young protostars,
and for researchers who wish to test their chemical modeling under dynamic astrophysical conditions.
It was also designed to identify statistical trends that may appear when running many models of the
formation of low-mass stars by varying the initial conditions. A large set of 143 calculations of
the gravitational collapse of an isolated sphere of gas with uniform temperature and a Bonnor-Ebert
like density profile was undertaken using a 1D fully implicit Lagrangian radiation hydrodynamics
code. The parameter space covered initial masses from 0.2 to 8 Msun, temperatures of 5-30 K and radii
between 3000 and 30,000 AU. A spread in the thermal evolutionary tracks of the runs was found, due
to differing initial conditions and optical depths. Within less than an order of magnitude, all
first and second Larson cores had masses and radii independent of the initial conditions. The time
elapsed between the formation of the first and second cores was found to strongly depend on the first
core mass accretion rate, and no first core in our grid of models lived for longer than 2000 years,
before the onset of the second collapse. The end product of a protostellar cloud collapse, the second
Larson core, is, at birth, a canonical object with a mass and radius of about 3 Mjup and 8 Rjup, independent
of its initial conditions. The evolution sequence which brings the gas to stellar densities can
however proceed in a variety of scenarios, on different timescales, along different isentropes,
but each story line can largely be predicted by the initial conditions. All the data from the simulations
