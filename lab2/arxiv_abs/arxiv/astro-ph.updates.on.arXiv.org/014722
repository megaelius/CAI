We perform two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of reconnection in magnetically-dominated
pair plasmas subject to strong Compton cooling. Reconnection under such conditions operates in
accretion disk coronae around black holes, which produce hard X-rays through Comptonization.
Our simulations show that most of the plasma in the reconnection layer is kept cold by Compton losses
and locked in magnetically-dominated plasmoids with small thermal pressure. Compton drag clears
cavities inside plasmoids and affects their bulk motions. These effects, however, weakly change
the reconnection rate and the plasmoid size distribution from those in non-radiative reconnection.
This demonstrates that the reconnection dynamics is governed by similar magnetic stresses in both
cases and weakly affected by thermal pressure. We examine the energy distribution of particles
energized by radiative reconnection and observe two components. (1) A mildly-relativistic peak,
which results from bulk motions of cooled plasmoids. This component receives most of the dissipated
reconnection power and dominates the output X-ray emission. The peak has a quasi-Maxwellian shape
with an effective temperature of 100 keV. Thus, it mimics thermal Comptonization used previously
to fit hard-state spectra of accreting black holes. (2) A high-energy tail, which receives 20% of
dissipated reconnection power. It is populated by particles accelerated impulsively at X-points
or "picked up" by fast outflows from X-points. The high-energy particles immediately cool, and
their inverse Compton emission explains the MeV spectral tail detected in the hard state of Cyg X-1.
Our first-principle simulations support reconnection as a mechanism powering hard X-ray emission
from accreting black holes.
