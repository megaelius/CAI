The analysis of the cluster environment is a valuable instrument to investigate the origin of AGN
and star-forming galaxies gas fuelling and trigger mechanisms. To this purpose, we present a detailed
analysis of the point-like X-ray sources in the Bullet cluster field. Thanks to $\sim600$ ks Chandra
observations, we produced a catalogue of 381 X-ray point sources up to a distance of $\sim$1.5 virial
radius and with flux limits $\sim1\times10^{-16}$ and $\sim8\times10^{-16}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$
in the 0.5-2 keV and 2-10 keV bands, respectively. We found a strong (up to a factor 1.5-2) and significant
($\ge$4$\sigma$) over-density in the full region studied $0.3R_{200}<R<1.5R_{200}$. We identified
optical and infrared counterparts for $\sim$84% and $\sim$48% of the X-ray sources, respectively.
We obtained new spectroscopic redshifts for 106 X-ray sources. Spectroscopic and photometric
redshifts of optical and infrared sources have been also collected, and these sources were used
as ancillary samples. We find that the over-density in the region $0.3R_{200}<R<R_{200}$ is likely
due to X-ray AGN (mostly obscured) and star-forming galaxies both associated to the cluster, while
in the more external region it is likely mostly due to background AGN. The fraction of cluster galaxies
hosting an X-ray detected AGN is 1.0$\pm$0.4$\%$, nearly constant with the radius, a fraction similar
to that reported in other clusters of galaxies at similar redshift. The fraction of X-ray bright
AGN (L$_{2-10keV}$$>$10$^{43}$ ergs s$^{-1}$) in the region $0.3R_{200}<R<R_{200}$ is $0.5^{+0.6}_{-0.2}$$\%$,
higher than that in other clusters at similar redshift and more similar to the AGN fraction in the
field. Finally, the spatial distributions of AGN and star-forming galaxies, selected also thanks
to their infrared emission, appear similar, thus suggesting that both are triggered by the same
mechanism.
