We use a combination of the XMM-Newton serendipitous X-ray survey with the optical SDSS, and the
infrared WISE all-sky survey in order to check the efficiency of the low X-ray to infrared luminosity
selection method in finding heavily obscured AGN. We select sources in the 2-8 keV X-ray band which
have a redshift determination in the SDSS catalogue. We match this sample with the WISE catalogue,
and fit the SEDs of the 2844 sources which have three, or more, photometric data-points in the infrared.
We then select the heavily obscured AGN candidates by comparing their 12 micron AGN luminosity to
the observed 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity and their expected intrinsic relation. With this approach
we find 20 candidates, and we examine their X-ray and optical spectra. Of the 20 initial candidates,
we find nine (64%; out of the 14, for which X-ray spectra could be fit) based on the X-ray spectra, and
seven (78%; out of the nine detected spectroscopically in the SDSS) based on the [OIII] line fluxes.
Combining all criteria, we determine the final number of heavily obscured AGN to be 12-19, and the
number of Compton-thick AGN to be 2-5, showing that the method is reliable in finding obscured AGN,
but not Compton-thick. However those numbers are smaller than what would be expected from X-ray
background population synthesis models, which demonstrates how the optical-infrared selection
and the scatter of the L_x-L_MIR relation introduced by observational constraints limit the efficiency
of the method. Finally, we test popular obscured AGN selection methods based on mid-infrared colours,
and find that the probability of an AGN to be selected by its mid-infrared colours increases with
the X-ray luminosity. However, a selection scheme based on a relatively low X-ray luminosity and
mid-infrared colours characteristic of QSOs would not select ~25% of the heavily obscured AGN of
our sample. (abridged)
