The structure, kinematics, and chemical composition of the far side of the Milky Way disk, beyond
the bulge, are still to be revealed. Classical Cepheids (CCs) are young and luminous standard candles.
We aim to use a well-characterized sample of these variable stars to study the present time properties
of the far side of the Galactic disk. A sample of 45 Cepheid variable star candidates were selected
from near infrared time series photometry obtained by the VVV survey. We characterized this sample
using high quality near infrared spectra obtained with VLT/X-Shooter, deriving radial velocities
and iron abundances for all the sample Cepheids. This allowed us to separate the CCs, which are metal
rich and with kinematics consistent with the disk rotation, from type II Cepheids (T2Cs), which
are more metal poor and with different kinematics. We estimated individual distances and extinctions
using VVV photometry and period-luminosity relations, reporting the characterization of 30 CCs
located on the far side of the Galactic disk, plus 8 T2Cs mainly located in the bulge region, of which
10 CCs and 4 T2Cs are new discoveries. This is the first sizeable sample of CCs in this distant region
of our Galaxy that has been spectroscopically confirmed. We use their positions, kinematics, and
metallicities to confirm that the general properties of the far disk are similar to those of the well-studied
disk on the solar side of the Galaxy. In addition, we derive for the first time the radial metallicity
gradient on the disk's far side. Considering all the CCs with $R_{\mathrm{GC}} < 17\,\rm{kpc}$,
we measure a gradient with a slope of $-0.062 \, \mathrm{dex\, kpc^{-1}}$ and an intercept of $+0.59
\, \rm{dex}$, which is in agreement with previous determinations based on CCs on the near side of
the disk.
