Saturn's magnetospheric magnetic field, planetary radio emissions, plasma populations and magnetospheric
structure are all known to be modulated at periods close to the assumed rotation period of the planetary
interior. These oscillations are readily apparent despite the high degree of axi-symmetry in the
internally produced magnetic field of the planet, and have different rotation periods in the northern
and southern hemispheres. In this paper we study the spatial structure of (near-) planetary period
magnetic field oscillations in Saturn's equatorial magnetosphere. Extending previous analyses
of these phenomena, we include all suitable data from the entire Cassini mission during its orbital
tour of the planet, so as to be able to quantify both the amplitude and phase of these field oscillations
throughout Saturn's equatorial plane, to distances of 30 planetary radii. We study the structure
of these field oscillations in view of both independently rotating northern and southern systems,
finding spatial variations in both magnetic fields and inferred currents flowing north-south
that are common to both systems. With the greatly expanded coverage of the equatorial plane achieved
during the latter years of the mission, we are able to present a complete survey of dawn-dusk and day-night
asymmetries in the structure of the oscillating fields and currents. We show that the general structure
of the rotating currents is simpler than previously reported, and that the relatively enhanced
nightside equatorial fields and currents are due in part to related periodic vertical motion of
Saturn's magnetotail current sheet.
