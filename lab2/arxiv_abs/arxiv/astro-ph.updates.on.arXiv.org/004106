This work introduces a new interpretation of the gravitational N-body problem, based on the one-point
probability density $\Psi$ of finding a particle at a given location of phase space $(\mathbf{x},
\mathbf{v})$ at time $t$ and the associated expected phase-space density $\bar{f}(\mathbf{x},
\mathbf{v}, t) = M \Psi(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{v}, t)$ where $M$ is the total mass of the system. At
variance with the traditional paradigm, we consider that the problem is inherently stochastic,
and $\bar{f}$ corresponds to a weighted average over all possible random realisations corresponds
to a weighted average over all possible random realisations of the initial probability distribution
$\Psi(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{v}, 0)$. In practice, we run several numerical experiments in one dimension
where $\bar{f}(x, v, t)$, and thus $\Psi(x, v, t)$, are estimated from the average of a finite number
$S$ of independent simulations with $N$ particles each. The proposed approach is extremely efficient
from a computational point of view, with modest CPU and memory requirements, and it provides an alternative
to traditional N-body simulations when the goal is to study the average properties of N-body systems,
at the cost of abandoning the notion of well-defined trajectories for each individual particle.
Our results, fully consistent with those previously reported in the literature for the standard
deterministic formulation of the problem, highlight the differences between the evolution of
the one-point probability density $\Psi (x, v, t)$ and the predictions of the collisionless Boltzmann
(Vlasov-Poisson) equation, as well as the relatively subtle dependence on the actual finite number
N of particles in the system.
