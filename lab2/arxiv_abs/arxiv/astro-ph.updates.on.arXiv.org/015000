We analyze the rest-optical emission-line spectra of $z\sim2.3$ star-forming galaxies in the
complete MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey. In investigating the origin of the well-known
offset between the sequences of high-redshift and local galaxies in the [O III]5008/H$\beta$ vs.
[N II]6585/H$\alpha$ ("[N II] BPT") diagram, we define two populations of $z\sim2.3$ MOSDEF galaxies.
These include the "high" population that is offset towards higher [O III]5008/H$\beta$ and/or
[N II]6585/H$\alpha$ with respect to the local SDSS sequence and the "low" population that overlaps
the SDSS sequence. These two groups are also segregated within the [O III]5008/H$\beta$ vs. [S II]6718,6733/H$\alpha$
and the [O III]4960,5008/[O II]3727,3730 (O$_{32}$) vs. ([O III]4960,5008+[O II]3727,3730)/H$\beta$
(R$_{23}$) diagram, which suggests qualitatively that star-forming regions in the more offset
galaxies are characterized by harder ionizing spectra at fixed nebular oxygen abundance. We also
investigate many galaxy properties of the split sample and find that the "high" sample is on average
smaller in size and less massive, but has higher specific star-formation rate and star-formation-rate
surface density values and is slightly younger compared to the "low" population. From Cloudy+BPASS
photoionization models, we estimate that the "high" population has a lower stellar metallicity
(i.e., harder ionizing spectrum) but slightly higher nebular metallicity and higher ionization
parameter compared to the "low" population. While the "high" population is more $\alpha$-enhanced
(i.e., higher $\alpha$/Fe) than the "low" population, both samples are significantly more $\alpha$-enhanced
compared to local star-forming galaxies with similar rest-optical line ratios. These differences
must be accounted for in all high-redshift star-forming galaxies -- not only those "offset" from
local excitation sequences.
