We present a study of the overdensity of X-ray selected AGN in 33 galaxy clusters in the XMM-LSS field,
up to redhift z=1.05. Previous studies have shown that the presence of X-ray selected AGN in rich
galaxy clusters is suppressed. In the current study we investigate the occurrence of X-ray selected
AGN in low and moderate X-ray luminosity galaxy clusters. Due to the wide contiguous XMM-LSS survey
area we are able to extend the study to the cluster outskirts. We therefore determine the projected
overdensity of X-ray point-like sources out to 6r_{500} radius. To provide robust statistical
results we also use a stacking analysis of the cluster projected overdensities. We investigate
whether the observed X-ray overdensities are to be expected by estimating also the corresponding
optical galaxy overdensities. We find a positive X-ray projected overdensity at the first radial
bin, which is however of the same amplitude as that of optical galaxies. Therefore, no suppression
of X-ray AGN activity with respect to the field is found, implying that the mechanisms responsible
for the suppression are not so effective in lower density environments. After a drop to roughly the
background level between 2 and 3r_{500}, the X-ray overdensity exhibits a rise at larger radii,
significantly larger than the corresponding optical overdensity. Finally, using redshift information
of all optical counterparts, we derive the spatial overdensity profile of the clusters. We find
that the agreement between X-ray and optical overdensities in the first radial bin is also suggested
in the 3-dimensional analysis. However, we argue that the X-ray overdensity "bump" at larger radial
distance is probably a result of flux boosting by gravitational lensing of background QSOs. For
high redshift clusters an enhancement of X-ray AGN activity in their outskirts is still possible.
