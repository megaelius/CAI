Carbon-enriched rocky exoplanets have been proposed around dwarf stars as well as around binary
stars, white dwarfs and pulsars. However, the mineralogical make up of such planets is poorly constrained.
We performed high-pressure high-temperature laboratory experiments ($P$ = 1$-$2 GPa, $T$ = 1523$-$1823
K) on carbon-enriched chemical mixtures to investigate the deep interiors of Pluto- to Mars-size
planets the upper mantles of larger planets. Our results show that these exoplanets, when fully-differentiated,
comprise a metallic core, a silicate mantle and a graphite layer on top of the silicate mantle. The
silicate mineralogy (olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene and spinel) is largely unaffected
by the amount of carbon. Metals are either two immiscible iron-rich alloys (S-rich and S-poor) or
a single iron-rich alloy in the Fe-C-S system with immiscibility depending on the S/Fe ratio and
core pressure. Graphite is the dominant carbon-bearing phase at the conditions of our experiments
with no traces of silicon carbide or carbonates. If the bulk carbon content is higher than needed
to saturate the mantle and the core, graphite would be in the form of an additional layer on top of the
silicate mantle assuming differentiation. For a thick enough graphite layer, diamonds would form
at the bottom of this layer due to high pressures. We model the interior structure of Kepler-37b and
show that a mere 10 wt% graphite layer would decrease its derived mass by 7%, suggesting future space
missions that determine both radius and mass of rocky exoplanets with insignificant gaseous envelopes
could provide quantitative limits on their carbon content. Future observations of rocky exoplanets
with graphite-rich surfaces would show low albedos due to the low reflectance of graphite. The absence
of life-bearing elements other than carbon on the surface likely makes them uninhabitable.
