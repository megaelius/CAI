Comparing solar and stellar brightness variations is hampered by the difference in spectral passbands
used in observations as well as by the possible difference in the inclination of their rotation axes
from the line of sight. We calculate the rotational variability of the Sun as it would be measured
in passbands used for stellar observations. In particular, we consider the filter systems used
by the CoRoT, $Kepler$, TESS, and $Gaia$ space missions. We also quantify the effect of the inclination
of the rotation axis on the solar rotational variability. We employ the Spectral And Total Irradiance
REconstructions (SATIRE) model to calculate solar brightness variations in different filter
systems as observed from the ecliptic plane. We then combine the simulations of the surface distribution
of the magnetic features at different inclinations using a surface flux transport model (SFTM)
with the SATIRE calculations to compute the dependence of the variability on the inclination. For
an ecliptic-bound observer, the amplitude of the solar rotational variability, as observed in
the total solar irradiance (TSI) is 0.68 mmag (averaged over solar cycles 21-24). We obtained corresponding
amplitudes in the $Kepler$ (0.74 mmag), CoRoT (0.73 mmag), TESS (0.62 mmag), $Gaia~ $ (0.74 mmag),
$Gaia~ G_{RP}$ (0.62 mmag), and ), $Gaia~ G_{BP}$ (0.86 mmag) passbands. Decreasing the inclination
of the rotation axis decreases the rotational variability. For a sample of randomly inclined stars,
the variability is on average 15% lower in all filter systems considered in this work. This almost
compensates for the difference in the amplitudes of the variability in TSI and $Kepler$ passbands,
making the amplitudes derived from the TSI records an ideal representation of the solar rotational
variability for comparison to $Kepler$ stars with unknown inclinations.
