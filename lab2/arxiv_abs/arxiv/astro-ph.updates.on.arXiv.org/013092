GRB 160325A is the only bright burst detected by AstroSat CZT Imager in its primary field of view to
date. In this work, we present the spectral and polarimetric analysis of the prompt emission of the
burst using AstroSat, Fermi and Niel Gehrels Swift observations. The prompt emission consists
of two distinct emission episodes separated by a few seconds of quiescent/ mild activity period.
The first emission episode shows a thermal component as well as a low polarisation fraction of $PF
< 37\, \%$ at $1.5\, \sigma$ confidence level. On the other hand, the second emission episode shows
a non-thermal spectrum and is found to be highly polarised with $PF > 43\, \%$ at $1.5 \sigma$ confidence
level. We also study the afterglow properties of the jet using {\it Swift}/XRT data. The observed
jet break suggests that the jet is pointed towards the observer and has an opening angle of $1.2^{\circ}$
for an assumed redshift, $z = 2$. With composite modelling of polarisation, spectrum of the prompt
emission and the afterglow, we infer that the first episode of emission originates from the photosphere
with localised dissipation happening below it, and the second from the optically thin region above
the photosphere. The photospheric emission is generated mainly by inverse Compton scattering,
whereas the emission in the optically thin region is produced by the synchrotron process. The low
radiation efficiency of the burst suggests that the outflow remains baryonic dominated throughout
the burst duration with only a subdominant Poynting flux component, and the kinetic energy of the
jet is likely dissipated via internal shocks which evolves from an optically thick to optically
thin environment within the jet.
