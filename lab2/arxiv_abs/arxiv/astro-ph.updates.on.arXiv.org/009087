The ALMA Spectroscopic Survey in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (ASPECS) provides new constraints
for galaxy formation models on the molecular gas properties of galaxies. We compare results from
ASPECS to predictions from two cosmological galaxy formation models: the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical
simulations and the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model (SC SAM). We explore several recipes to model
the H$_2$ content of galaxies, finding them to be consistent with one another, and take into account
the sensitivity limits and survey area of ASPECS. For a canonical CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor
of $\alpha_{\rm CO} = 3.6\,\rm{M}_\odot/(\rm{K}\,\rm{km/s}\,\rm{pc}^{2})$ the results of
our work include: (1) the H$_2$ mass of $z>1$ galaxies predicted by the models as a function of their
stellar mass is a factor of 2-3 lower than observed; (2) the models do not reproduce the number of H$_2$-rich
($M_{\rm H2} > 3\times 10^{10}\,\rm{M}_\odot$) galaxies observed by ASPECS; (3) the H$_2$ cosmic
density evolution predicted by IllustrisTNG (the SC SAM) is in tension (only just agrees) with the
observed cosmic density, even after accounting for the ASPECS selection function and field-to-field
variance effects. The tension between models and observations at $z>1$ can be alleviated by adopting
a CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor in the range $\alpha_{\rm CO} = 2.0 - 0.8\,\rm{M}_\odot/(\rm{K}\,\rm{km/s}\,\rm{pc}^{2})$.
Additional work on constraining the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor and CO excitation conditions
of galaxies through observations and theory will be necessary to more robustly test the success
of galaxy formation models.
