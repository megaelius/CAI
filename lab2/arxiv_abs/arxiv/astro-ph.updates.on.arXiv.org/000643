According to the fossil-field hypothesis magnetic fields are remnants of the previous stages of
evolution. However, population synthesis calculations are unable to reproduce the magnetic white
dwarf (MWD) sample without binary interaction or inclusion of a population of progenitor with unobservable
small-scale fields. One necessary ingredient in population synthesis is the initial-to-final-mass
relation (IFMR) which describes the mass-loss processes during the stellar evolution. When white
dwarfs are members of open clusters, their evolutionary histories can be assessed through the use
of cluster properties. In this work, we assess the cluster membership by correlating the proper-motion
of MWDs with the cluster proper-motion and by analyzing the candidates spectroscopically with
our magnetic model spectra in order to estimate the effective temperature and radii. We identified
SDSS J085523.87+164059.0 to be a proper-motion member of Praesepe. We also included the data of
the formerly identified cluster members NGC 6819-8, WD 0836+201 and estimated the mass, cooling
age and the progenitor masses of the three probable MWD members of open clusters. According to our
analysis, the newly identified cluster member SDSS J085523.87+164059.0 is an ultra-massive MWD
of mass 1.12 $\pm$ 0.11 Msolar. We increase the sample of MWDs with known progenitor masses to ten,
with the rest of the data coming from the common proper motion binaries. Our investigations show
that, when effects of the magnetic fields are included in the diagnostics, the estimated properties
of these cluster MWDs do not show evidence for deviations from the IFMR. Furthermore, we estimate
the precision of the magnetic diagnostics which would be necessary to determine quantitatively
whether magnetism has any effect on the mass-loss.
