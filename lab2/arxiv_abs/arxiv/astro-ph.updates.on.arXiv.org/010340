The discrepancy between the values of the Hubble constant $H_0$ derived from the local distance
ladder and the Cosmic Microwave Background provides a tantalising hint of new physics. We explore
a potential resolution involving screened fifth forces in the local Universe, which alter the Cepheid
calibration of supernova distances. In particular, if the Cepheids with direct distance measurements
from parallax or water masers are screened but a significant fraction of those in other galaxies
are not, neglecting the difference between their underlying period--luminosity relations biases
the local $H_0$ measurement high. This difference derives from a reduction in the Cepheid pulsation
period and possible increase in luminosity under a fifth force. We quantify the internal and environmental
gravitational properties of the Riess et al. distance ladder galaxies to assess their degrees of
screening under a range of phenomenological models, and propagate this information into the $H_0$
posterior as a function of fifth force strength. We consider well-studied screening models in scalar--tensor
gravity theories such as chameleon, K-mouflage and Vainshtein, along with a recently-proposed
mechanism based on baryon--dark matter interactions in which screening is governed by the local
dark matter density. We find that a fifth force strength $\sim5-30\%$ that of gravity can alleviate
the $H_0$ tension in many scenarios, around the sensitivity level at which tests based on other distance
ladder data can constrain this strength. Our most successful models achieve consistency with Planck
at the $\sim$1.5$\sigma$ level. Although our analysis is exploratory and based on screening models
that are not necessarily realised in full theories, our results demonstrate that new physics-based
local resolutions of the $H_0$ tension are possible, supplementing those already known in the pre-recombination
era.
