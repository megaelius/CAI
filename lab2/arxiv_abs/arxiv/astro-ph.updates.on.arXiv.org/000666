We present a comprehensive analysis of the optical and X-ray light curves (LCs) and spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of a large sample of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows to investigate the relationship
between the optical and X-ray emission after the prompt phase. We collected the optical data from
the literature and determined the shapes of the optical LCs. Then, using previously presented X-ray
data we modeled the optical/X-ray SEDs. We studied the SED parameter distributions and compared
the optical and X-ray LC slopes and shapes. The optical and X-ray spectra become softer as a function
of time while the gas-to-dust ratios of GRBs are higher than the values calculated for the Milky Way
and the Large and Magellanic Clouds. For 20% of the GRBs the difference between the optical and X-ray
slopes is consistent with 0 or 1=4 within the uncertainties (we did it not consider the steep decay
phase), while in the remaining 80% the optical and X-ray afterglows show significantly different
temporal behaviors. Interestingly, we find an indication that the onset of the forward shock in
the optical LCs (initial peaks or shallow phases) could be linked to the presence of the X-ray flares.
Indeed, when X-ray flares are present during the steep decay, the optical LC initial peak or end plateau
occurs during the steep decay; if instead the X-ray flares are absent or occur during the plateau,
the optical initial peak or end plateau takes place during the X-ray plateau. The forward-shock
model cannot explain all features of the optical (e.g. bumps, late re-brightenings) and X-ray (e.g.
flares, plateaus) LCs. However, the synchrotron model is a viable mechanism for GRBs at late times.
In particular, we found a relationship between the presence of the X-ray flares and the shape of the
optical LC that indicates a link between the prompt emission and the optical afterglow.
