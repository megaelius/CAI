We compare the Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) cluster sample (PSZ1) to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) redMaPPer catalog, finding that all Planck clusters within the redMaPPer mask and within
the redshift range probed by redMaPPer are contained in the redMaPPer cluster catalog. These common
clusters define a tight scaling relation in the richness-SZ mass ($\lambda$--$M_{SZ}$) plane,
with an intrinsic scatter in richness of $\sigma_{\lambda|M_{SZ}} = 0.266 \pm 0.017$. The corresponding
intrinsic scatter in true cluster halo mass at fixed richness is $\approx 21\%$. The regularity
of this scaling relation is used to identify failures in both the redMaPPer and Planck cluster catalogs.
Of the 245 galaxy clusters in common, we identify three failures in redMaPPer and 36 failures in the
PSZ1. Of these, at least 12 are due to clusters whose optical counterpart was correctly identified
in the PSZ1, but where the quoted redshift for the optical counterpart in the external data base used
in the PSZ1 was incorrect. The failure rates for redMaPPer and the PSZ1 are $1.2\%$ and $14.7\%$ respectively,
or 9.8% in the PSZ1 after subtracting the external data base errors. We have further identified 5
PSZ1 sources that suffer from projection effects (multiple rich systems along the line-of-sight
of the SZ detection) and 17 new high redshift ($z\gtrsim 0.6$) cluster candidates of varying degrees
of confidence. Should all of the high-redshift cluster candidates identified here be confirmed,
we will have tripled the number of high redshift Planck clusters in the SDSS region. Our results highlight
the power of multi-wavelength observations to identify and characterize systematic errors in
galaxy cluster data sets, and clearly establish photometric data both as a robust cluster finding
method, and as an important part of defining clean galaxy cluster samples.
