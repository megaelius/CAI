We present molecular line observations of the high-mass molecular clump IRAS 16562$-$3959 taken
at 3 mm using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 1.$\!\!^{\prime\prime}$7
angular resolution ($0.014$ pc spatial resolution). This clump hosts the actively accreting high-mass
young stellar object (HMYSO) G345.4938+01.4677, associated with a hypercompact HII region. We
identify and analyze emission lines from 22 molecular species (encompassing 34 isomers) and classify
them into two groups, depending on their spatial distribution within the clump. One of these groups
gathers shock tracers (e.g., SiO, SO, HNCO) and species formed in dust grains like methanol (CH$_3$OH),
ethenone or ketene (H$_2$CCO), and acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO). The second group collects species
resembling the dust continuum emission morphology and which are formed mainly in the gas-phase,
like hydrocarbons (CCH, c-C$_3$H$_2$, CH$_3$CCH), cyanopolyynes (HC$_3$N and HC$_5$N) and cyanides
(HCN and CH$_3$C$_3$N). Emission from complex organic molecules (COMs) like CH$_3$OH, propanenitrile
(CH$_3$CH$_2$CN), and methoxymethane (CH$_3$OCH$_3$) arise from gas in the vicinity of a hot molecular
core ($T\gtrsim100$ K) associated with the HMYSO. Other COMs such as propyne (CH$_3$CCH), acrylonitrile
(CH$_2$CHCN), and acetaldehyde seem to better trace warm ($T\lesssim80$ K) dense gas. In addition,
deuterated ammonia (NH$_2$D) is detected mostly in the outskirts of IRAS 16562$-$3959, associated
with near-infrared dark globules, probably gaseous remnants of the clump's prestellar phase.
The spatial distribution of molecules in IRAS 16562$-$3959 supports the view that in protostellar
clumps, chemical tracers associated with different evolutionary stages --- starless to hot cores/HII
regions --- exist coevally.
