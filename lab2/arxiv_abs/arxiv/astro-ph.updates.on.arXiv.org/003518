We present observed mid-infrared and optical colors and composite spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of type 1 (broad-line) and 2 (narrow-line) quasars selected from Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) spectroscopy. A significant fraction of powerful quasars are obscured by dust, and are difficult
to detect in optical photometric or spectroscopic surveys. However these may be more easily identified
on the basis of mid-infrared (MIR) colors and SEDs. Using samples of SDSS type 1 type 2 matched in redshift
and [OIII] luminosity, we produce composite rest-frame 0.2-15 micron SEDs based on SDSS, UKIDSS,
and Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) photometry and perform model fits using simple
galaxy and quasar SED templates. The SEDs of type 1 and 2 quasars are remarkably similar, with the
differences explained primarily by the extinction of the quasar component in the type 2 systems.
For both types of quasar, the flux of the AGN relative to the host galaxy increases with AGN luminosity
(L_[OIII]) and redder observed MIR color, but we find only weak dependencies of the composite SEDs
on mechanical jet power as determined through radio luminosity. We conclude that luminous quasars
can be effectively selected using simple MIR color criteria similar to those identified previously
(W1-W2 > 0.7 [Vega]), although these criteria miss many heavily obscured objects. Obscured quasars
can be further identified based on optical-IR colors (for example, (u-W3 [AB]) > 1.4(W1-W2 [Vega])+3.2).
These results illustrate the power of large statistical studies of obscured quasars selected on
the basis of mid-IR and optical photometry.
