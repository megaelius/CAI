We consider the three-body mean motion resonance defined by the Jovian moons Io, Europa, and Ganymede,
which is commonly known as the Laplace resonance. In particular, we construct approximate models
for the evolution of the librating argument over the period of 100 years, focusing on its principal
amplitude and frequency, and on the observed mean motion combinations associated with the quasi-resonant
interactions. First, we numerically propagated the Cartesian equations of motion of the Jovian
system for the period under examination, and by comparing the results with a suitable set of ephemerides,
we derived the main dynamical effects on the target quantities. Using these effects, we built an
alternative Hamiltonian formulation and used the normal forms theory to locate the resonance and
to compute its main amplitude and frequency. From the Cartesian model we observe that on the timescale
considered and with ephemerides as initial conditions, both the librating argument and the diagnostics
are well approximated by considering the mutual gravitational interactions of Jupiter and the
Galilean moons (including Callisto), and the effect of Jupiter's J2 harmonic. Under the same initial
conditions, the Hamiltonian formulation in which Callisto and J2 are reduced to their secular contributions
achieves larger errors for the quantities above, particularly for the librating argument. By introducing
appropriate resonant variables, we show that these errors can be reduced by moving in a certain action-angle
phase plane, which in turn implies the necessity of a tradeoff in the selection of the initial conditions.
In addition to being a good starting point for a deeper understanding of the Laplace resonance, the
models and methods described are easily generalizable to different types of multi-body mean motion
resonances. They are also prime tools for studying the dynamics of extrasolar systems.
