We present the results from three gravitational-wave searches for coalescing compact binaries
with component masses above 1$\mathrm{M}_\odot$ during the first and second observing runs of
the Advanced gravitational-wave detector network. During the first observing run (O1), from September
$12^\mathrm{th}$, 2015 to January $19^\mathrm{th}$, 2016, gravitational waves from three binary
black hole mergers were detected. The second observing run (O2), which ran from November $30^\mathrm{th}$,
2016 to August $25^\mathrm{th}$, 2017, saw the first detection of gravitational waves from a binary
neutron star inspiral, in addition to the observation of gravitational waves from a total of seven
binary black hole mergers, four of which we report here for the first time: GW170729, GW170809, GW170818
and GW170823. For all significant gravitational-wave events, we provide estimates of the source
properties. The detected binary black holes have total masses between $18.6_{-0.7}^{+3.1}\mathrm{M}_\odot$,
and $85.1_{-10.9}^{+15.6} \mathrm{M}_\odot$, and range in distance between $320_{-110}^{+120}$
Mpc and $2750_{-1320}^{+1350}$ Mpc. No neutron star - black hole mergers were detected. In addition
to highly significant gravitational-wave events, we also provide a list of marginal event candidates
with an estimated false alarm rate less than 1 per 30 days. From these results over the first two observing
runs, which include approximately one gravitational-wave detection per 15 days of data searched,
we infer merger rates at the 90% confidence intervals of 110 - 3840 $\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{y}^{-1}$
for binary neutron stars and 9.7 - 101 $\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{y}^{-1}$ for binary black
holes, and determine a neutron star - black hole merger rate 90% upper limit of 610 $\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{y}^{-1}$.
