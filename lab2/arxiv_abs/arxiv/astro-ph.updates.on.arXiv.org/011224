The anomalous microwave emission (AME) still lacks a conclusive explanation. This excess of emission,
roughly between 10 and 50 GHz, tends to defy attempts to explain it as synchrotron or free-free emission.
The overlap with frequencies important for cosmic microwave background explorations, combined
with a strong correlation with interstellar dust, drive cross-disciplinary collaboration between
interstellar medium and observational cosmology. The apparent relationship with dust has prompted
a ``spinning dust'' hypothesis. The typical peak frequency range of the AME profile implicates
spinning grains on the order of 1 nm. This points to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We
use data from the AKARI/Infrared Camera (IRC), due to its thorough PAH-band coverage, to compare
AME from the Planck Collaboration astrophysical component separation product with infrared dust
emission in the Orionis AME-prominent region. We look also at infrared dust emission from other
mid IR and far-IR bands. The results and discussion contained here apply to an angular scale of approximately
1{\deg}. We find that certainly dust mass correlates with AME, and that PAH-related emission in
the AKARI/IRC 9 {\mu}m band correlates slightly more strongly. Using hierarchical Bayesian inference
and full dust spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling we argue that AME in {\lambda}Orionis
correlates more strongly with PAH mass than with total dust mass, lending support for a spinning
PAH hypothesis within this region. We emphasize that future efforts to understand AME should focus
on individual regions, and a detailed comparison of the PAH features with the variation of the AME
SED.
