Comprehensive spectral analyses of the Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars of the nitrogen sequence (i.e.\
the WN subclass) have been performed in a previous paper. However, the distances of these objects
were poorly known. Distances have a direct impact on the "absolute" parameters, such as luminosities
and mass-loss rates. The recent Gaia Data Release (DR2) of trigonometric parallaxes includes nearly
all WN stars of our Galactic sample. In the present paper, we apply the new distances to the previously
analyzed Galactic WN stars and rescale the results accordingly. On this basis, we present a revised
catalog of 55 Galactic WN stars with their stellar and wind parameters. The correlations between
mass-loss rate and luminosity show a large scatter, for the hydrogen-free WN stars as well as for
those with detectable hydrogen. The slopes of the $\log L - \log \dot{M}$ correlations are shallower
than found previously. The empirical Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD) still shows the previously
established dichotomy between the hydrogen-free early WN subtypes that are located on the hot side
of the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS), and the late WN subtypes, which show hydrogen and reside mostly
at cooler temperatures than the ZAMS (with few exceptions). However, with the new distances, the
distribution of stellar luminosities became more continuous than obtained previously. The hydrogen-showing
stars of late WN subtype are still found to be typically more luminous than the hydrogen-free early
subtypes, but there is a range of luminosities where both subclasses overlap. The empirical HRD
of the Galactic single WN stars is compared with recent evolutionary tracks. Neither these single-star
evolutionary models nor binary scenarios can provide a fully satisfactory explanation for the
parameters of these objects and their location in the HRD.
