What sort of supernova gave rise to the Crab Nebula? There are several indications that the Crab arose
from a sub-energetic explosion of an 8-10 Msun star, this appears to conflict with the high luminosity
indicated by historical observations. This paper shows that several properties of the Crab are
best suited to Type IIn-P explosions (Type IIn spectra with plateau light curves). These events
probably arise from relatively low-energy (1e50 erg) explosions with low 56Ni yield resulting
from electron-capture SNe (ecSNe), but their high luminosity and Type IIn spectra are dominated
by shock interaction with CSM. After about 120 days, nearly all of the mass in the CSM and ejecta ends
up in a slow dense shell. In the scenario proposed here for SN1054, this thin shell is accelerated
by the growing pulsar wind nebula, producing the complex network of filaments seen today. There
is no need to invoke the invisible fast SN envelope hypothesized to reside outside the Crab. SNeIIn-P
explain several observed features of the Crab: (1) No blast wave or rapidly expanding SN envelope
outside the filaments, (2) a total mass of 5 Msun swept up in a thin shell, (3) a high peak luminosity
despite the low kinetic energy, and (4) chemical abundances consistent with an 8-10 Msun star and
low 56Ni yield. A number of other implications are discussed, concerning other plerionic remnants,
dust in the Crab filaments, diversity in the initial masses of SNe IIn, and an association between
ecSNe and SN impostors. This model predicts that if light echoes from SN1054 are discovered, they
will be consistent with a Type IIn-P spectrum.
