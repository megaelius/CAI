A key aspect in the determination of stellar properties is the comparison of observational constraints
with predictions from stellar models. Asteroseismic Inference on a Massive Scale (AIMS) is an open
source code that uses Bayesian statistics and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to find a representative
set of models that reproduce a given set of classical and asteroseismic constraints. These models
are obtained by interpolation on a pre-calculated grid, thereby increasing computational efficiency.
We test the accuracy of the different operational modes within AIMS for grids of stellar models computed
with the Li\`ege stellar evolution code (main sequence and red giants) and compare the results to
those from another asteroseismic analysis pipeline, PARAM. Moreover, using artificial inputs
generated from models within the grid (assuming the models to be correct), we focus on the impact
on the precision of the code when considering different combinations of observational constraints
(individual mode frequencies, period spacings, parallaxes, photospheric constraints,...).
Our tests show the absolute limitations of precision on parameter inferences using synthetic data
with AIMS, and the consistency of the code with expected parameter uncertainty distributions.
Interpolation testing highlights the significance of the underlying physics to the analysis performance
of AIMS and provides caution as to the upper limits in parameter step size. All tests demonstrate
the flexibility and capability of AIMS as an analysis tool and its potential to perform accurate
ensemble analysis with current and future asteroseismic data yields.
