The role of galactic wind recycling represents one of the largest unknowns in galaxy evolution,
as any contribution of recycling to galaxy growth is largely degenerate with the inflow rates of
first-time infalling material, and the rates with which outflowing gas and metals are driven from
galaxies. We present measurements of the efficiency of wind recycling from the EAGLE cosmological
simulation project, leveraging the statistical power of large-volume simulations that reproduce
a realistic galaxy population. We study wind recycling at the halo scale, i.e. gas that has been ejected
beyond the halo virial radius, and at the galaxy scale, i.e. gas that has been ejected from the ISM
to at least $\approx 10 \, \%$ of the virial radius (thus excluding smaller-scale galactic fountains).
Galaxy-scale wind recycling is generally inefficient, with a characteristic return timescale
that is comparable or longer than a Hubble time, and with an efficiency that clearly peaks at the characteristic
halo mass of $M_{200} = 10^{12} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$. Correspondingly, the majority of gas being
accreted onto galaxies in EAGLE is infalling for the first time. At the halo scale, the efficiency
of recycling onto haloes differs by orders of magnitude from values assumed by semi-analytic galaxy
formation models. Differences in the efficiency of wind recycling with other hydrodynamical simulations
are currently difficult to assess, but are likely smaller. We are able to show that the fractional
contribution of wind recycling to galaxy growth is smaller in EAGLE than in some other simulations.
We find that cumulative first-time gas accretion rates at the virial radius are reduced relative
to the expectation from dark matter accretion for haloes with mass, $M_{200} < 10^{12} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$,
indicating efficient preventative feedback on halo scales.
