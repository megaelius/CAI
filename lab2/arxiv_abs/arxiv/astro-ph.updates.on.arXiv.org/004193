The exterior gravitational field of a slowly-rotating neutron star can be characterized by its
multipole moments, the first few being the neutron star mass, moment of inertia, and quadrupole
moment to quadratic order in spin. In principle, all of these quantities depend on the neutron star's
internal structure, and thus, on unknown nuclear physics at supra-nuclear energy densities. We
here find relations between the moment of inertia, the Love numbers and the quadrupole moment (I-Love-Q
relations) that do not depend sensitively on the neutron star's internal structure. Three important
consequences derive from these I-Love-Q relations. On an observational astrophysics front, the
measurement of a single member of the I-Love-Q trio would automatically provide information about
the other two, even when the latter may not be observationally accessible. On a gravitational wave
front, the I-Love-Q relations break the degeneracy between the quadrupole moment and the neutron-star
spins in binary inspiral waveforms, allowing second-generation ground-based detectors to determine
the (dimensionless) averaged spin to $\mathcal{O}(10)%$, given a sufficiently large signal-to-noise
ratio detection. On a fundamental physics front, the I-Love-Q relations allow for tests of General
Relativity in the neutron-star strong-field that are both theory- and internal structure-independent.
As an example, by combining gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations, one may constrain
dynamical Chern-Simons gravity in the future by more than 6 orders of magnitude more stringently
than Solar System and table-top constraints.
