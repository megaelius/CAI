We model the long-term XUV luminosity of TRAPPIST-1 to constrain the evolving high-energy radiation
environment experienced by its planetary system. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), we derive
probabilistic constraints for TRAPPIST-1's stellar and XUV evolution that account for observational
uncertainties, degeneracies between model parameters, and empirical data of low-mass stars.
We constrain TRAPPIST-1's mass to $m_{\star} = 0.089 \pm{0.001}$ M$_{\odot}$ and find that its
early XUV luminosity likely saturated at $\log_{10}(L_{XUV}/L_{bol}) = -3.03^{+0.23}_{-0.12}$.
From the posterior distribution, we infer that there is a ${\sim}40\%$ chance that TRAPPIST-1 is
still in the saturated phase today, suggesting that TRAPPIST-1 has maintained high activity and
$L_{XUV}/L_{bol} \approx 10^{-3}$ for several Gyrs. TRAPPIST-1's planetary system therefore
likely experienced a persistent and extreme XUV flux environment, potentially driving significant
atmospheric erosion and volatile loss. The inner planets likely received XUV fluxes ${\sim}10^3
- 10^4\times$ that of the modern Earth during TRAPPIST-1's ${\sim}1$ Gyr-long pre-main sequence
phase. Deriving these constraints via MCMC is computationally non-trivial, so scaling our methods
to constrain the XUV evolution of a larger number of M dwarfs that harbor terrestrial exoplanets
would incur significant computational expenses. We demonstrate that approxposterior, an open
source Python machine learning package for approximate Bayesian inference using Gaussian processes,
accurately and efficiently replicates our analysis using $980\times$ less computational time
and $1330\times$ fewer simulations than MCMC sampling using emcee. We find that approxposterior
derives constraints with mean errors on the best fit values and $1\sigma$ uncertainties of $0.61\%$
and $5.5\%$, respectively, relative to emcee.
