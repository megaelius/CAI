We present the different consistency relations that can be seen as variations of the well known Suyama-Yamaguchi
(SY) consistency relation \tau_{NL} \geqslant ((6/5) f_{NL})^2. It has been claimed that the following
variation: \tau_{NL} ({\bf k}_1, {\bf k_3}) \geqslant (6/5)^2 f_{NL} ({\bf k}_1) f_{NL} ({\bf
k}_3), which we call "the fourth variety", in the collapsed (for \tau_{NL}) and squeezed (for f_{NL})
limits is always satisfied independently of any physics; however, the proof depends sensitively
on the assumption of scale-invariance which only applies for cosmological models involving Lorentz-invariant
scalar fields (at least at tree level), leaving room for a strong violation of this variety of the
consistency relation when non-trivial degrees of freedom, for instance vector fields, are in charge
of the generation of \zeta. With this in mind as a motivation, we explicitly state under which conditions
the SY consistency relation has been claimed to hold in its different varieties (implicitly) presented
in the literature; as a result, we show for the first time that the variety \tau_{NL} ({\bf k}_1, {\bf
k}_1) \geqslant ((6/5) f_{NL} ({\bf k}_1))^2, which we call "the fifth variety", is always satisfied
even when there is strong scale-dependence as long as statistical homogeneity holds: thus, an observed
violation of this specific variety would prevent the comparison between theory and observation,
shaking this way the foundations of cosmology as a science. Later, we concern about the existence
of non-trivial degrees of freedom, concretely vector fields for which the levels of non-gaussianity
have been calculated for very few models, finding that the fourth variety of the SY consistency relation
is indeed strongly violated for some specific wavevector configurations while the fifth variety
continues to be well satisfied. (Abridged)
