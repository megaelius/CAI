Massive stars and their associated ionized (HII) regions could play a key role in the formation and
evolution of filaments that host star formation. However, the properties of filaments that interact
with H regions are still poorly known. To investigate the impact of HII regions on the formation of
filaments, we imaged the Galactic HII region RCW 120 and its surroundings where active star formation
takes place and where the role of ionization feedback on the star formation process has already been
studied. We used the ArT\'eMiS camera on the APEX telescope and combined the ArT\'eMiS data at 350
and 450 microns with Herschel-SPIRE/HOBYS. We studied the dense gas distribution around RCW 120
with a resolution of 8 arcsec (0.05 pc at a distance of 1.34 kpc). Our study allows us to trace the median
radial intensity profile of the dense shell of RCW 120. This profile is asymmetric, indicating a
clear compression from the HII region on the inner part of the shell. The profile is observed to be
similarly asymmetric on both lateral sides of the shell, indicating a homogeneous compression
over the surface. On the contrary, the profile analysis of a radial filament associated with the
shell, but located outside of it, reveals a symmetric profile, suggesting that the compression
from the ionized region is limited to the dense shell. The mean intensity profile of the internal
part of the shell is well fitted by a Plummer like profile with a deconvolved Gaussian FWHM of 0.09
pc, as observed for filaments in low-mass star-forming regions. This study suggests that compression
exerted by HII regions may play a key role in the formation of filaments and may further act on their
hosted star formation. ArT\'eMiS data also suggest that RCW 120 might be a 3D ring, rather than a spherical
structure
