Secular extragalactic parallax caused by the solar system's velocity relative to the cosmic microwave
background rest frame may be observable as a dipole proper motion field with amplitude $78~\mu$as
yr$^{-1}$ Mpc. Nearby galaxies also exhibit proper motions caused by their transverse peculiar
velocities that prevent detection of secular parallax for any single galaxy, although a statistical
detection may be made instead. Such a detection could constrain the local Hubble parameter. We present
methods to measure secular parallax using correlated extragalactic proper motions and find a first
limit on the secular parallax amplitude using proper motions of 232 nearby galaxies from Gaia Data
Release 2. The recovered dipole has insignificant upper limit of 3500 $\mu$as yr$^{-1}$ Mpc. This
measurement will be improved by larger sample size and reduced proper motion uncertainties in future
data releases. Using the local peculiar velocity field derived from Cosmicflows-3, we simulate
galaxy proper motions and predict that a significant detection ($5-10\sigma$) of the secular parallax
amplitude will be possible by Gaia's end of mission. The detection is contingent on proper motions
of nearby ($<5$ Mpc), bright ($G<15$ mag) galaxies, and corresponds to an insignificant upper limit
on the Hubble parameter. We further investigate the implications of our simulations for the study
of transverse peculiar velocities, which we find to be consistent with large scale structure theory.
The peculiar velocity field additionally results in low-multipole correlated proper motions
on the order of $0.3~\mu$as yr$^{-1}$ that may be confounded with other cosmological proper motion
measurements, such as limits on the gravitational wave background and the anisotropy of the Hubble
expansion.
