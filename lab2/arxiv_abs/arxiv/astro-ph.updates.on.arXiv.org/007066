We present a study of a recently discovered stellar overdensity near the northern edge of the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMCNOD). We exploited variable stars from the fourth release of the Optical Gravitational
Lensing Experiment (OGLE). We used mainly pulsating variable stars and investigated their potential
association with the SMCNOD using their spatial distribution and distances. We found four rather
spatially concentrated anomalous Cepheids and eight evenly dispersed RR~Lyrae stars to be most
likely members of this overdensity. The anomalous Cepheids inside the SMCNOD trace possible intermediate-age
population with ages ranging between $2-4.5$ Gyr. The age distribution of anomalous Cepheids seems
to be in a good agreement with the age distribution of anomalous Cepheids in the SMC. Using empirical
relations for RR~Lyrae stars we determined the median metallicity for a possible old population
in the SMCNOD to be $\rm [Fe/H]_{\rm SMCNOD}=-1.71\pm0.21$ dex, which is in agreement with median
metallicity of the old SMC population. The density profile for anomalous Cepheids shows a small
anomaly at the position of the SMCNOD, on the other hand, RR~Lyrae variables show no such deviation.
The probability of finding the observed number of variable stars at the location of the SMCNOD by
chance is very low for anomalous Cepheids (0.7 %) but high for RR~Lyrae stars (13.0 %). Based on its
variable stars content, we thus confirm the presence of a modest overdensity in intermediate-age
stars in the SMCNOD and conclude that it probably has its origin in the SMC rather than to be the remnant
of an accreted dwarf galaxy.
