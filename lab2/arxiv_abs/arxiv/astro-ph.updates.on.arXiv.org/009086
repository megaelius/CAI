Radial-velocity variations of the K giant star Aldebaran ($\alpha$ Tau) were first reported in
the early 1990s. After subsequent analyses, the radial-velocity variability with a period of $\sim
629\,\mathrm{d}$ has recently been interpreted as caused by a planet of several Jovian masses.
We want to further investigate the hypothesis of an extrasolar planet around Aldebaran. We combine
165 new radial-velocity measurements from Lick Observatory with seven already published data
sets comprising 373 radial-velocity measurements. We perform statistical analyses and investigate
whether a Keplerian model properly fits the radial velocities. We also perform a dynamical stability
analysis for a possible two-planet solution. As best Keplerian fit to the combined radial-velocity
data we obtain an orbit for the hypothetical planet with a smaller period ($P=607\,\mathrm{d}$)
and a larger eccentricity ($e=0.33 \pm 0.04$) than the previously proposed one. However, the residual
scatter around that fit is still large, with a standard deviation of $117\,\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$.
In 2006/2007, the statistical power of the $\sim 620\,\mathrm{d}$ period showed a temporary but
significant decrease. Plotting the growth of power in reverse chronological order reveals that
a period around $620\,\mathrm{d}$ is clearly present in the newest data but not in the data taken
before $\sim$ 2006. Furthermore, an apparent phase shift between radial-velocity data and orbital
solution is observable at certain times. A two-planet Keplerian fit matches the data considerably
better than a single-planet solution, but poses severe dynamical stability issues. The radial-velocity
data from Lick Observatory do not further support but in fact weaken the hypothesis of a substellar
companion around Aldebaran. Oscillatory convective modes might be a plausible alternative explanation
of the observed radial-velocity variations.
