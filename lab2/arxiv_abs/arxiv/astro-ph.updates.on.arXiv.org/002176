We present Nustar 3-40 keV observations of the optically selected Type 2 quasar (QSO2) SDSS J1034+6001
or Mrk 34. The high-quality hard X-ray spectrum and archival XMM-Newton data can be fitted self-consistently
with a reflection-dominated continuum and strong Fe Kalpha fluorescence line with equivalent-width
>1 keV. Prior X-ray spectral fitting below 10 keV showed the source to be consistent with being
obscured by Compton-thin column densities of gas along the line-of-sight, despite evidence for
much higher columns from multiwavelength data. NuSTAR now enables a direct measurement of this
column, and shows that Nh lies in the Compton-thick (CT) regime. The new data also show a high intrinsic
2-10 keV luminosity of L_{2-10}~10^{44} erg/s, in contrast to previous low-energy X-ray measurements
for which L_{2-10}<~10^{43} erg/s (i.e. X-ray selection below 10 keV does not pick up this source
as an intrinsically luminous obscured quasar). Both the obscuring column and the intrinsic power
are about an order of magnitude (or more) larger than inferred from pre-NuSTAR X-ray spectral fitting.
Mrk34 is thus a 'gold standard' CT QSO2 and is the nearest non-merging system in this class, in contrast
to the other local CT quasar NGC6240 which is currently undergoing a major merger coupled with strong
star-formation. For typical X-ray bolometric correction factors, the accretion luminosity of
Mrk34 is high enough to potentially power the total infrared luminosity. X-ray spectral fitting
also shows that thermal emission related to star-formation is unlikely to drive the observed bright
soft component below ~3 keV, favoring photionization instead.
