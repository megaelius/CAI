The alpha effect is believed to play a key role in the generation of the solar magnetic field. A fundamental
test for its significance in the solar dynamo is to look for magnetic helicity of opposite signs in
the two hemispheres, and at small and large scales. However, measuring magnetic helicity is compromised
by the inability to fully infer the magnetic field vector from observations of solar spectra, caused
by what is known as the "pi ambiguity" of spectropolarimetric observations. We decompose linear
polarisation into parity-even and parity-odd E and B polarisations, which are not affected by the
"pi ambiguity". Furthermore, we study whether the correlations of spatial Fourier spectra of B
and parity-even quantities such as E or temperature T are a robust proxy for magnetic helicity of
solar magnetic fields. We analyse polarisation measurements of active regions observed by the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics observatory. Theory predicts the
magnetic helicity of active regions to have, statistically, opposite signs in the two hemispheres.
We then compute the parity-odd E B and T B correlations, and test for systematic preference of their
sign based on the hemisphere of the active regions. We find that: (i) E B and T B correlations are a reliable
proxy for magnetic helicity, when computed from linear polarisation measurements away from spectral
line cores, and (ii) E polarisation reverses its sign close to the line core. Our analysis reveals
Faraday rotation to not have a significant influence on the computed parity-odd correlations.
The EB decomposition of linear polarisation appears to be a good proxy for magnetic helicity independent
of the "pi ambiguity". This allows us to routinely infer magnetic helicity directly from polarisation
measurements.
