Cosmography has been referred to as a solution to the inverse scattering problem, which is reasonable
since it allows us to calculate cosmological bounds from data samplers by performing an expansion
of the cosmological observables around present time. Nevertheless, this approach is not properly
an inverse scattering solution since the method only circumvents the problem to fit the equation
of state (EoS) parameters (model-dependent) by replacing it with their fit of its cosmographic
parameters (with a polynomial series-dependence). Therefore, can we construct a new cosmography
approach where the cosmodynamical parameters can be fitted and then employ them to analyse the kinematics
via its generic cosmographic parameters? By all means, without experimenting the problem of truncation
of the series that all cosmography proposals in the literature argue. In this work we present a generic
EoS depending solely on the form of $f_{i}(z)$ and its derivative is found, where this function can
be any polynomial (mimicking a dark energy-like term) that allow the dynamics of a specific cosmological
density. We test our generic EoS with standard cosmological models and with polynomials proposals
as Pad\'e and Chebyshev approximants. Interesting enough, a Pad\'e (2,2) approximant has been
considered inside a $f(z)$CDM-like model showing a transition in $z=1$. Also, we found that this
is not assured since models with these characteristics have degeneracy and truncation problems
that experiment a divergence at this redshift limit. To explore our results, also we present a new
supernovae sample trained via a deep learning tool called Recurrent-Bayesian (RNN+BNN) network
that can solve problems as overfitting at lower redshifts and increase the density of data points
in this region, which can help to discern between cosmographies at 2-$\sigma$ of precision.
