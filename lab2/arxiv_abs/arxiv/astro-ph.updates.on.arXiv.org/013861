Interferometric visibilities, reflecting the complex correlations between signals recorded
at antennas in an interferometric array, carry information about the angular structure of a distant
source. While unknown antenna gains in both amplitude and phase can prevent direct interpretation
of these measurements, certain combinations of visibilities called closure phases and closure
amplitudes are independent of antenna gains and provide a convenient set of robust observables.
However, these closure quantities have subtle noise properties and are generally both linearly
and statistically dependent. These complications have obstructed the proper use of closure quantities
in interferometric analysis, and they have obscured the relationship between analysis with closure
quantities and other analysis techniques such as self calibration. We review the statistics of
closure quantities, noting common pitfalls that arise when approaching low signal-to-noise due
to the nonlinear propagation of statistical errors. We then develop a strategy for isolating and
fitting to the independent degrees of freedom captured by the closure quantities through explicit
construction of linearly independent sets of quantities along with their noise covariance in the
Gaussian limit, valid for moderate signal-to-noise, and we demonstrate that model fits have biased
posteriors when this covariance is ignored. Finally, we introduce a unified procedure for fitting
to both closure information and partially calibrated visibilities, and we demonstrate both analytically
and numerically the direct equivalence of inference based on closure quantities to that based on
self calibration of complex visibilities with unconstrained antenna gains.
