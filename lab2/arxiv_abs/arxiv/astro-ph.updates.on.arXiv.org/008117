We report the discovery by the HATSouth project of 5 new transiting hot Jupiters (HATS-54b through
HATS-58Ab). HATS-54b, HATS-55b and HATS-58Ab are prototypical short period ($P = 2.5-4.2$ days,
$R_p\sim1.1-1.2$ $R_J$) hot-Jupiters that span effective temperatures from 1350 K to 1750 K, putting
them in the proposed region of maximum radius inflation efficiency. The HATS-58 system is composed
of two stars, HATS-58A and HATS-58B, which are detected thanks to Gaia DR2 data and which we account
for in the joint modelling of the available data --- with this, we are led to conclude that the hot jupiter
orbits the brighter HATS-58A star. HATS-57b is a short-period (2.35-day) massive (3.15 $M_J$)
1.14 $R_J$, dense ($2.65\pm0.21$ g cm$^{-3}$) hot-Jupiter, orbiting a very active star ($2\%$
peak-to-peak flux variability). Finally, HATS-56b is a short period (4.32-day) highly inflated
hot-Jupiter (1.7 $R_J$, 0.6 $M_J$), which is an excellent target for future atmospheric follow-up,
especially considering the relatively bright nature ($V=11.6$) of its F dwarf host star. This latter
exoplanet has another very interesting feature: the radial velocities show a significant quadratic
trend. If we interpret this quadratic trend as arising from the pull of an additional planet in the
system, we obtain a period of $P_c = 815^{+253}_{-143}$ days for the possible planet HATS-56c, and
a minimum mass of $M_c\sin i_c = 5.11 \pm 0.94$ $M_J$. The candidate planet HATS-56c would have a zero-albedo
equilibrium temperature of $T_\textrm{eq}=332\pm 50$ K, and thus would be orbiting close to the
habitable zone of HATS-56. Further radial-velocity follow-up, especially over the next two years,
is needed to confirm the nature of HATS-56c.
