Weak heating events (~ $10^{17}$ - $10^{20}$ J) are frequent and ubiquitous in the solar corona,
but the underlying heating mechanism is still not very well understood. A major candidate for heating
is weak flaring events which leave nearly undetectable signatures in the Extreme Ultra-Violet
(EUV) and X-Ray bands. However, these events often lead to various plasma instabilities which produce
coherent radiation at radio wavelengths. Hence they can easily be detected and studied using radio
imaging studies. But, often multiple such events happen on the Sun or these events get obscured by
coherent emission sites that are stronger by orders of magnitude. With the advent of high dynamic
range snapshot spectroscopic imaging, it has become possible to monitor indivudual coherent emission
sites by generating SPatially REsolved Dynamic Spectra (SPREDS). We present a multi-waveband
imaging study of an active region combining SPREDS at metre wavelengths with spatially resolved
EUV and X-Ray flux light curves. A simultaneous rise in the temperature, X-Ray flux, the local mean
coherent radio flux density and occurrence rate of second-scale coherent radio "spikes" was observed.
The "spiky" radio features are indicative of weak particle acceleration events. The lifetime of
the "spikes" match ion-electron collisional damping scale in the local plasma. The radio and X-Ray
sources also showed strong 30 s pulsations in their fluxes during heating/temperature rise. This
timescale match the Alfven transit time across the bright active region loop segment that coincided
with the X-Ray source. Our observations support the picture of coronal heating via numerous faint
flares/particle acceleration events which convert the magnetic free energy to heat. We find that
the acceleration events are excited in a periodic manner with a periodicity comparable to Alfven
transit time.
