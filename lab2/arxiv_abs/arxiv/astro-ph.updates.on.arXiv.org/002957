Recent high angular resolution observations of protoplanetary disks at different wavelengths
have reveled several kind of structures, including multiple bright and dark rings. Embedded planets
are the most used explanation for such structures, but there are alternative models capable to shape
the dust in rings as it has been observed. We assume a disk around a Herbig star and investigate the
effect that ice lines have on the dust evolution, following the growth, fragmentation and dynamics
of multiple dust size particles, covering from 1 $\mu$m to 2 m sized objects. We use simplified prescriptions
of the fragmentation velocity threshold, which is assumed to change radially at the location of
one, two, or three ice lines. We assume changes at the radial location of main volatiles, specifically
H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and NH$_3$. Radiative transfer calculations are done using the resulting dust
density distributions in order to compare with current multi-wavelength observations. We find
that the structures in the dust density profiles and radial intensities at different wavelengths
strongly depend on the disk viscosity. A clear gap of emission can be formed between ice lines and
be surrounded by ring-like structures, in particular between the H$_2$O and CO$_2$ (or CO). The
gaps are expected to be shallower and narrower at millimeter emission than at near-infrared, opposite
to model predictions of particle trapping. In our models, the total gas surface density is not expected
to show strong variations, in contrast to other gap-forming scenarios such as embedded giant planets
or radial variations of the disk viscosity.
