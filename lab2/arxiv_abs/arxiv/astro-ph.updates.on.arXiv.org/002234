To study physical properties of the natal filament gas around the cloud core harboring an exceptionally
young low-mass protostar GF9-2, we carried out J=1-0 line observations of 12CO, 13CO, and C18O molecules
using the Nobeyama 45m telescope. The mapping area covers ~1/5 of the whole filament. Our 13CO and
C18O maps clearly demonstrate that the core formed at the local density maxima of the filament, and
the internal motions of the filament gas are totally governed by turbulence with Mach number of ~2.
We estimated the scale height of the filament to be H = 0.3 ~ 0.7 pc, yielding the central density of
n_c = 700 ~4200 cm^-3. Our analysis adopting an isothermal cylinder model shows that the filament
is supported by the turbulent and magnetic pressures against the radial and axial collapse due to
self-gravity. Since both the dissipation time scales of the turbulence and the transverse magnetic
fields can be comparable to the free-fall time of the filament gas of 10^6 years, we conclude that
the local decay of the supersonic turbulence made the filament gas locally unstable, hence making
the core collapse. Furthermore, we newly detected a gas condensation with velocity width enhancement
to ~0.3 pc south-west of the GF9-2 core. The condensation has a radius of ~0.15 pc and an LTE mass of
~5 Msun. Its internal motion is turbulent with Mach number of ~3, suggestive of a gravitationally
unbound state. Considering the uncertainties in our estimates, however, we propose that the condensation
is a precursor of a cloud core which would have been produced by the collision of the two gas components
identified in the filament.
