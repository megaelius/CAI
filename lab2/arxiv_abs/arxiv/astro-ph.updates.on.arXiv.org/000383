The Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile is often used to model gravitational lenses. For
low values of the characteristic convergence ($\kappa_s \ll 1$) of this model - corresponding to
galaxy and galaxy group mass scales - a high numerical precision is required in order to accurately
compute several quantities in the strong lensing regime. An alternative for fast and accurate computations
is to derive analytic approximations in this limit. In this work we obtain analytic solutions for
several lensing quantities for elliptical (ENFW) and pseudo-elliptical (PNFW) NFW lens models
on the typical scales where gravitational arcs are expected to be formed, in the $\kappa_s \ll 1$
limit, establishing their domain of validity. We derive analytic solutions for the convergence
and shear for these models, obtaining explicit expressions for the iso-convergence contours and
constant distortion curves (including the tangential critical curve). We also compute the deformation
cross section, which is given in closed form for the circular NFW model and in terms of a one-dimensional
integral for the elliptical ones. In addition, we provide a simple expression for the ellipticity
of the iso-convergence contours of the pseudo-elliptical models and the connection of characteristic
convergences among the PNFW and ENFW models. We conclude that the set of solutions derived here is
generally accurate for $\kappa_s \lesssim 0.1$. For low ellipticities, values up to $\kappa_s
\simeq 0.18$ are allowed. On the other hand, the mapping between PNFW and the ENFW models is valid
up to $\kappa_s \simeq 0.4$. The solutions derived in this work can be used to speed up numerical codes
and ensure their accuracy in the low $\kappa_s$ regime, including applications to arc statistics
and other strong lensing observables. (Abridged)
