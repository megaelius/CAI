Strong gravitational lenses with measured time delay are a powerful tool to measure cosmological
parameters, especially the Hubble constant ($H_0$). Recent studies show that by combining just
three multiply-imaged AGN systems, one can determine $H_0$ to 3.8% precision. Furthermore, the
number of time-delay lens systems is growing rapidly, enabling, in principle, the determination
of $H_0$ to 1% precision in the near future. However, as the precision increases it is important to
ensure that systematic errors and biases remain subdominant. For this purpose, challenges with
simulated datasets are a key component in this process. Following the experience of the past challenge
on time delay, where it was shown that time delays can indeed be measured precisely and accurately
at the sub-percent level, we now present the "Time Delay Lens Modeling Challenge" (TDLMC). The goal
of this challenge is to assess the present capabilities of lens modeling codes and assumptions and
test the level of accuracy of inferred cosmological parameters given realistic mock datasets.
We invite scientists to model a set of simulated Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of 50
mock lens systems. The systems are organized in rungs, with the complexity and realism increasing
going up the ladder. The goal of the challenge is to infer $H_0$ for each rung, given the HST images,
the time delay, and a stellar velocity dispersion of the deflector, for a fixed background cosmology.
The TDLMC challenge will start with the mock data release on 2018 January 8th, with a deadline for
blind submission of 2018 August 8th. This first paper gives an overview of the challenge including
the data design, and a set of metrics to quantify the modeling performance and challenge details.
After the deadline, the results of the challenge will be presented in a companion paper with all challenge
participants as co-authors.
