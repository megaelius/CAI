LIGO/VIRGO gravitational wave (GW) detectors have successfully detected and measured the parameters
of stellar-mass black hole (BH) and neutron star (NS) sources. With the ongoing upgrades of LIGO
and VIRGO, and the commissioning of KAGRA, the sensitivity is expected to further improve in the
coming years, which may lead to the detection of new types of GW sources. Using the Fisher matrix method,
in a recent paper (Gond\'an et al. 2018), we determined the measurement accuracy of physical parameters
for eccentric, non-spinning, inspiraling, stellar-mass BH-BH binaries for the upcoming second-generation
LIGO/VIRGO/KAGRA detector network at design sensitivity. Here we extend that study to a wide range
of binary masses including NS-NS, NS-BH, and BH-BH binaries with BH masses up to $110 \, M_{\odot}$.
We find that the measurement error of the eccentricity at GW frequency of $10 \, {\rm Hz}$ and at the
last stable orbit are in the range $(10^{-4}-10^{-3}) \times D_{\rm L}/(100\,\rm Mpc)$ and $(10^{-6}-10^{-3})
\times D_{\rm L}/(100\,\rm Mpc)$, respectively, for NS-NS, NS-BH, and BH-BH binaries if $e_{10
\,\rm Hz} > 0.1$, where $D_L$ is the luminosity distance and lower errors correspond to lower masses.
In comparison to circular inspirals, the chirp mass measurement accuracy is improved by a factor
of $10-10^3$, and the distance, source sky location, and binary orientation measurement precision
are improved by a factor of $2-20$ for NS-BH and BH-BH binaries with BH masses in the range $50 \, M_{\odot}
- 110 \, M_{\odot}$. The identification of eccentric sources may give information on their astrophysical
origin; it would indicate merging binaries in triple or higher multiplicity systems or dynamically
formed binaries in dense stellar systems such as globular clusters or galactic nuclei.
