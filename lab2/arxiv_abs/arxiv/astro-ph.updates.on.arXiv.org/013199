Weak gravitational lensing has emerged as a leading probe of the growth of cosmic structure. However,
the shear signal is very small and accurate measurement depends critically on our ability to understand
how non-ideal instrumental effects affect astronomical images. WFIRST will fly a focal plane containing
18 Teledyne H4RG-10 near infrared detector arrays, which present different instrument calibration
challenges from previous weak lensing observations. Previous work has shown that correlation
functions of flat field images are effective tools for disentangling linear and non-linear inter-pixel
capacitance (IPC) and the brighter-fatter effect (BFE). Here we present a Fourier-domain treatment
of the flat field correlations, which allows us to expand the previous formalism to all orders in
IPC, BFE, and classical non-linearity. We show that biases in simulated flat field analyses in Paper
I are greatly reduced through the use of this formalism. We then apply this updated formalism to flat
field data from three WFIRST flight candidate detectors, and explore the robustness to variations
in the analysis. We find that the BFE is present in all three detectors, and that its contribution
to the flat field correlations dominates over the non-linear IPC. The magnitude of the BFE is such
that the effective area of a pixel is increased by $(3.54\pm0.03)\times 10^{-7}$ for every electron
deposited in a neighboring pixel. We compare IPC maps from flat field autocorrelation measurements
to those obtained from the single pixel reset method and find a median difference of 0.113%. After
further diagnosis of this difference, we ascribe it largely to an additional source of cross-talk,
the vertical trailing pixel effect, and recommend further work to develop a model for this effect.
These results represent a significant step toward calibration of the non-ideal effects in WFIRST
detectors.
