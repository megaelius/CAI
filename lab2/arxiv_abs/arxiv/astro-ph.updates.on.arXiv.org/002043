Experiments that observe coherent radio emission from extensive air showers induced by ultra-high
energy cosmic rays are designed for a detailed study of the development of the electromagnetic part
of air showers. Radio detectors can operate with 100% up time as e.g. surface detectors based on water-Cherenkov
tanks. They are being developed for ground-based experiments (e.g. the Pierre Auger Observatory)
as another type of air shower detector in addition to the fluorescence detectors, which operate
with only ~10% of duty in dark nights. The radio signals from air showers are caused by the coherent
emission due to geomagnetic radiation and charge excess processes. Currently used self-triggers
in radio detectors often generate a dense stream of data, which is analyzed afterwards. Huge amounts
of registered data requires a significant man-power for the off-line analysis. An improvement
of the trigger efficiency becomes a relevant factor. In this work, Morlet wavelets with various
scaling factors were used for an analysis of real data from the Auger Engineering Radio Array and
for an optimization of the utilization of the resources in an FPGA. The wavelet analysis showed that
the power of events is concentrated mostly in a limited range of the frequency spectrum (consistent
with a range imposed by the input analog band-pass filter). However, we found several events with
suspicious spectral characteristics, where the signal power is spread over the full band-width
sampled by a 200 MHz digitizer with significant contribution of very high and very low frequencies.
These events may not origin from cosmic ray showers but can be human-made contaminations. The engine
of the wavelet analysis can be implemented into the modern powerful FPGA and can remove suspicious
events on-line to reduce the trigger rate.
