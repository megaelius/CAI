We report on the discovery of a new Milky Way (MW) satellite in Bo\"otes based on data from the on-going
Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program (SSP). This satellite, named Bo\"otes IV, is
the third ultra-faint dwarf that we have discovered in the HSC-SSP. We have identified a statistically
significant (32.3$\sigma$) overdensity of stars having characteristics of a metal-poor, old
stellar population. The distance to this stellar system is $D_{\odot}=209^{+20}_{-18}$ kpc with
a $V$-band absolute magnitude of $M_V=-4.53^{+0.23}_{-0.21}$ mag. Bo\"otes IV has a half-light
radius of $r_h=462^{+98}_{-84}$ pc and an ellipticity of $0.64^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$, which clearly
suggests that this is a dwarf satellite galaxy. We also found another overdensity that appears to
be a faint globular cluster with $M_V=-0.20^{+0.59}_{-0.83}$ mag and $r_h=5.9^{+1.5}_{-1.3}$
pc located at $D_{\odot}=46^{+4}_{-4}$ kpc. Adopting the recent prediction for the total population
of satellites in a MW-sized halo by Newton et al. (2018), which combined the characteristics of the
observed satellites by SDSS and DES with the subhalos obtained in $\Lambda$CDM models, we estimate
that there should be about two MW satellites at $M_V\le0$ in the $\sim676$ deg$^2$ covered by HSC-SSP,
whereas that area includes six satellites. Thus, the observed number of satellites is larger than
the theoretical prediction. On the face of it, we have a problem of too many satellites, instead of
the well-known missing satellites problem whereby the $\Lambda$CDM theory overpredicts the number
of satellites in a MW-sized halo. This may imply that the models need more refinements for the assignment
of subhalos to satellites such as considering those found by the current deeper survey. [abridged]
