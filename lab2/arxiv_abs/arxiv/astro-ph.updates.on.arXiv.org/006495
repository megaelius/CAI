Galaxy clusters host a large reservoir of diffuse plasma with radially-varying temperature profiles.
The efficiency of thermal conduction in the intracluster medium (ICM) is complicated by the existence
of turbulence and magnetic fields, and has received a lot of attention in the literature. Previous
studies suggest that the magnetothermal instability developed in outer regions of galaxy clusters
would drive magnetic field lines preferentially radial, resulting in efficient conduction along
the radial direction. Using a series of spherically-symmetric simulations, here we investigate
the impact of thermal conduction on the observed temperature distributions in outer regions of
three massive clusters, and find that thermal conduction substantially modifies the ICM temperature
profile. Within 3 Gyr, the gas temperature at a representative radius of $0.3r_{500}$ typically
decreases by ~10 - 20% and the average temperature slope between $0.3r_{500}$ and $r_{500}$ drops
by ~ 30 - 40%, indicating that the observed ICM would not stay in a long-term equilibrium state in the
presence of thermal conduction. However, X-ray observations show that the outer regions of massive
clusters have remarkably similar radially-declining temperature profiles, suggesting that
they should be quite stable. Our study thus suggests that the effective conductivity along the radial
direction must be suppressed below the Spitzer value by a factor of 10 or more, unless additional
heating sources offset conductive cooling and maintain the observed temperature distributions.
Our study provides a smoking-gun evidence for the suppression of parallel conduction along magnetic
field lines in low-collisionality plasmas by kinetic mirror or whistler instabilities.
