Ultralight primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses $\lesssim 10^{15}$g and subatomic Schwarzschild
radii, produced in the early Universe, are expected to have evaporated by the current cosmic age
due to Hawking radiation. Based on this assumption, a number of constraints on the abundance of ultralight
PBHs have been made. However, Hawking radiation has thus far not been verified experimentally.
It would, therefore, be of interest if constraints on ultralight PBHs could be placed independent
of the assumption of Hawking-radiation. In this paper, we explore the possibility of probing these
PBHs, within a narrow mass range, using gravitational-wave (GW) data from the two LIGO detectors.
The idea is that large primordial curvature perturbations that result in the formation of PBHs,
would also generate GWs through non-linear mode couplings. These induced GWs would produce a stochastic
background. Specifically, we focus our attention on PBHs of mass range $\sim 10^{13} - 10^{15}$g
for which the induced stochastic GW background peak falls in the sensitivity band of LIGO. We find
that, for both narrow and broad Gaussian PBH mass distributions, the corresponding GW background
would be detectable using presently available LIGO data, provided we neglect the existing constraints
on the abundance of PBHs, which are based on Hawking radiation. Furthermore, we find that these stochastic
backgrounds would be detectable in LIGO's third observing run, even after considering the existing
constraints on PBH abundance. A non-detection should enable us to constrain the amplitude of primordial
curvature perturbations as well as the abundance of ultralight PBHs. We estimate that by the end
of the third observing run, assuming non-detection, we should be able to place constraints that
are orders of magnitude better than currently existing ones.
