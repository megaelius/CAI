We present a study of cold gas absorption from a damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorber (DLA) at redshift
$z_{\rm abs}=1.946$ towards two lensed images of the quasar J144254.78+405535.5 at redshift $z_{\rm
QSO} = 2.590$. The physical separation of the two lines of sight at the absorber redshift is $d_{\rm
abs}=0.7$~kpc based on our lens model. We observe absorption lines from neutral carbon and H$_2$
along both lines of sight indicating that cold gas is present on scales larger than $d_{\rm abs}$.
We measure column densities of HI to be $\log N(\rm H\,\i) = 20.27\pm0.02$ and $20.34\pm0.05$ and
of H$_2$ to be $\log N(\rm H_2) = 19.7\pm0.1$ and $19.9\pm0.2$. The metallicity inferred from sulphur
is consistent with Solar metallicity for both sightlines: $[{\rm S/H}]_A = 0.0\pm0.1$ and $[{\rm
S/H}]_B = -0.1\pm0.1$. Based on the excitation of low rotational levels of H$_2$, we constrain the
temperature of the cold gas phase to be $T=109\pm20$ and $T=89\pm25$ K for the two lines of sight.
From the relative excitation of fine-structure levels of CI, we constrain the hydrogen volumetric
densities in the range of $40-110$ cm$^{-3}$. Based on the ratio of observed column density and volumetric
density, we infer the average individual `cloud' size along the line of sight to be $l\approx0.1$
pc. Using the transverse line-of-sight separation of 0.7 kpc together with the individual cloud
size, we are able to put an upper limit to the volume filling factor of cold gas of $f_{\rm vol} < 0.2$
%. Nonetheless, the projected covering fraction of cold gas must be large (close to unity) over scales
of a few kpc in order to explain the presence of cold gas in both lines of sight. Compared to the typical
extent of DLAs (~10-30 kpc), this is consistent with the relative incidence rate of CI absorbers
and DLAs.
