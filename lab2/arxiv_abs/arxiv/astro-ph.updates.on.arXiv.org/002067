Using SofI on the 3.5m New Technology Telescope, we have conducted an extensive near-infrared monitoring
survey of an unbiased sample of 69 brown dwarfs spanning the L0 and T8 spectral range, with at least
one example of each spectral type. Each target was observed for a 2-4 hour period in the Js-band, and
the median photometric precision of the data is ~0.7%. A total of 14 brown dwarfs were identified
as variables with min-to-max amplitudes ranging from 1.7% to 10.8% over the observed duration.
All variables satisfy a statistical significance threshold with a p-value <5% based on comparison
with the median reference star light curve. Approximately half of the variables show sinusoidal
amplitude variations similar to 2M2139, and the remainder shows short timescale evolving light
curves similar to SIMP0136. The L/T transition has been suggested to be a region of a higher degree
of variability if patchy clouds are present and this survey was designed to test the patchy cloud
model with photometric monitoring of both the L/T transition and non-transition brown dwarfs.
Considering the targets identified as variable with the same statistical threshold, the measured
variability frequency of 13^{+10}_{-4}% for the L7 -- T4 transition region is indistinguishable
from that of the earlier spectral types (32^{+11}_{-8}%), the later spectral types (13^{+10}_{-4}%),
or the combination of all non-transition region brown dwarfs (21^{+7}_{-5}%). The variables are
not concentrated at the transition, in a specific colour, or with binaries. We note that of the systems
previously monitored for variability only ~60% maintained the state of variability (variable
or constant), with the remaining switching states. The 14 variables include nine newly identified
variables that will provide important systems for follow-up multi-wavelength monitoring to further
investigate brown dwarf atmosphere physics.
