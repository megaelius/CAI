We quantify the correlations between gas-phase and stellar metallicities and global properties
of galaxies, such as stellar mass, halo mass, age and gas fraction, in the Evolution and Assembly
of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations.
The slope of the correlation between stellar mass and metallicity of star-forming (SF) gas ($M_*-Z_{\rm
SF,gas}$ relation) depends somewhat on resolution, with the higher-resolution run reproducing
a steeper slope. This simulation predicts a non-zero metallicity evolution, increasing by $\approx
0.5$ dex at $\sim 10^9 {\rm M}_{\odot}$ since $z = 3$. The simulated relation between stellar mass,
metallicity and star formation rate at $z \lesssim 5$ agrees remarkably well with the observed fundamental
metallicity relation. At $M_* \lesssim 10^{10.3} {\rm M}_{\odot}$ and fixed stellar mass, higher
metallicities are associated with lower specific star formation rates, lower gas fractions and
older stellar populations. On the other hand, at higher $M_*$, there is a hint of an inversion of the
dependence of metallicity on these parameters. The fundamental parameter that best correlates
with the metal content, in the simulations, is the gas fraction. The simulated gas fraction-metallicity
relation exhibits small scatter and does not evolve significantly since $z = 3$. In order to better
understand the origin of these correlations, we analyse a set of lower resolution simulations in
which feedback parameters are varied. We find that the slope of the simulated $M_*-Z_{\rm SF,gas}$
relation is mostly determined by stellar feedback at low stellar masses ($M_* \lesssim 10^{10}
{\rm M}_{\odot}$), and at high masses ($M_* \gtrsim 10^{10} {\rm M}_{\odot}$) by the feedback from
active galactic nuclei.
