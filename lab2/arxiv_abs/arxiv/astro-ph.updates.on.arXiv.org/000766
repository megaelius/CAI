Runaway instability operates in fluid tori around black holes. It affects systems close to the critical
(cusp overflowing) configuration. The runaway effect depends on the radial profile l(R) of the
angular momentum distribution of the fluid, on the dimension-less spin a of the central black hole,
and other factors, such as self-gravity. Previously it was demonstrated that, for the power-law
dependence of the radial angular momentum profile, non-magnetized tori always become runaway
stable for a sufficiently high positive value of q. Here we discuss the role of runaway instability
within a framework of an axially symmetric model of perfect fluid endowed with a purely toroidal
magnetic field. The gradual accretion of material over the cusp transfers the mass and angular momentum
into the black hole, thereby changing the intrinsic parameters of the Kerr metric. We studied the
effect of the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure and other parameters of the model on the evolution
of critical configurations that are just on the verge of cusp overflow. We show that the toroidal
magnetic component inside an accretion torus does not change the frequency of its oscillations
significantly. We identify these oscillations as the radial epicyclic mode. These weak effects
can trigger the runaway instability even in situations when the purely hydrodynamical regime of
the torus is stable. On the other hand, in most cases the stable configuration remains unaffected,
and the initial deviations gradually decay after several orbital periods. We show examples of the
torus evolution depending on the initial magnetization beta, the slope q, and the spin a. The toroidal
magnetic field plays a more important role in the early phases of the accretion process until the
perturbed configuration finds a new equilibrium or disappears because of the runaway instability.
