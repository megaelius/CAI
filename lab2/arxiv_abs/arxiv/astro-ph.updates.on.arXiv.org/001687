We study the effect of AGN mechanical and radiation feedback on the formation of bulge dominated
galaxies via mergers of disc galaxies. The merging galaxies have mass-ratios of 1:1 to 6:1 and include
pre-existing hot gaseous halos to properly account for the global impact of AGN feedback. Using
smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation code (GADGET-3) we compare three models with different
AGN feedback models: (1) no black hole and no AGN feedback; (2) thermal AGN feedback; and (3) mechanical
and radiative AGN feedback. The last model is motivated by observations of broad line quasars which
show winds with initial velocities of $v_w \ge$ 10,000 km/s and also heating associated with the
central AGN X-ray radiation. The primary changes in gas properties due to mechanical AGN feedback
are lower thermal X-ray luminosity from the final galaxy - in better agreement with observations
- and galactic outflows with higher velocity $\sim 1000$ km/s similar to recent direct observations
of nearby merger remnants. The kinetic energy of the outflowing gas is a factor of $\sim$ 20 higher
than in the thermal feedback case. All merger remnants with momentum-based AGN feedback with $v_w
\sim 10,000$ km/s and $\epsilon_w=2 \times 10^{-3}$, independent of their progenitor mass-ratios,
reproduce the observed relations between stellar velocity dispersion and black hole mass ($M_{\rm
bh} - \sigma$) as well as X-ray luminosity ($L_X - \sigma$) with $10^{37.5}$ erg/s $\lesssim L_X
(0.3-8~{\rm keV}) \lesssim 10^{39.2}$ erg/s for velocity dispersions in the range of 120 km/s $\lesssim
\sigma \lesssim$ 190 km/s. In addition, the mechanical feedback produces a much greater AGN variability.
We also show that gas is more rapidly and impulsively stripped from the galactic centres driving
a moderate increase in galaxy size and decrease in central density with the mechanical AGN feedback
model.
