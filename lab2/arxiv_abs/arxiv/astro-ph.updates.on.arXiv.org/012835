We present spatially resolved maps of six individually-detected Lyman alpha haloes (LAHs) as well
as a first statistical analysis of the Lyman alpha (Lya) spectral signature in the circum-galactic
medium of high-redshift star-forming galaxies using MUSE. Our resolved spectroscopic analysis
of the LAHs reveals significant intrahalo variations of the Lya line profile. Using a three-dimensional
two-component model for the Lya emission, we measure the full width at half maximum (FWHM), the peak
velocity shift and the asymmetry of the Lya line in the core and in the halo of 19 galaxies. We find that
the Lya line shape is statistically different in the halo compared to the core for ~40% of our galaxies.
Similarly to object-by-object based studies and a recent resolved study using lensing, we find
a correlation between the peak velocity shift and the width of the Lya line both at the interstellar
and circum-galactic scales. While there is a lack of correlation between the spectral properties
and the spatial scale lengths of our LAHs, we find a correlation between the width of the line in the
LAH and the halo flux fraction. Interestingly, UV bright galaxies show broader, more redshifted
and less asymmetric Lya lines in their haloes. The most significant correlation found is for the
FWHM of the line and the UV continuum slope of the galaxy, suggesting that the redder galaxies have
broader Lya lines. The generally broad and red line shapes found in the halo component suggests that
the Lya haloes are powered either by scattering processes through an outflowing medium, fluorescent
emission from outflowing cold clumps of gas, or a mix of both. Considering the large diversity of
the Lya line profiles observed in our sample and the lack of strong correlation, the interpretation
of our results is still broadly open and underlines the need for realistic spatially resolved models
of the LAHs.
