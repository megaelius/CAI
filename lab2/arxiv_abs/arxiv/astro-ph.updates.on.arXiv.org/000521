For Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs), the resonance lines of N V, Si IV, and C IV, as well as the He II 1640
A line, act as diagnostics of the accretion process. Here we assemble a large high-resolution dataset
of these lines in CTTSs and Weak T Tauri Stars (WTTSs). We present data for 35 stars: one Herbig Ae star,
28 CTTSs, and 6 WTTSs. We decompose the C IV and He II lines into broad and narrow Gaussian components
(BC & NC). The most common (50 %) C IV line morphology in CTTSs is that of a low-velocity NC together
with a redshifted BC. The velocity centroids of the BCs and NCs are such that V_BC > 4 * V_NC, consistent
with the predictions of the accretion shock model, in at most 12 out of 22 CTTSs. We do not find evidence
of the post-shock becoming buried in the stellar photosphere due to the pressure of the accretion
flow. The He II CTTSs lines are generally symmetric and narrow, less redshifted than the CTTSs C IV
lines, by ~10 km/sec. The flux in the BC of the He II line is small compared to that of the C IV line, consistent
with models of the pre-shock column emission. The observations are consistent with the presence
of multiple accretion columns with different densities or with accretion models that predict a
slow-moving, low-density region in the periphery of the accretion column. For HN Tau A and RW Aur
A, most of the C IV line is blueshifted suggesting that the C IV emission is produced by shocks within
outflow jets. In our sample, the Herbig Ae star DX Cha is the only object for which we find a P-Cygni
profile in the C IV line, which argues for the presence of a hot (10^5 K) wind. For the overall sample,
the Si IV and N V line luminosities are correlated with the C IV line luminosities, although the relationship
between Si IV and C IV shows large scatter about a linear relationship and suggests that TW Hya, V4046
Sgr, AA Tau, DF Tau, GM Aur, and V1190 Sco are silicon-poor.
