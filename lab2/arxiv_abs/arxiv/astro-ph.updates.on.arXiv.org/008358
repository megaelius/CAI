Observations of Jupiter's gravity field by Juno have revealed surprisingly small values for the
high order gravitational moments, considering the abundances of heavy elements measured by Galileo
20 years ago. The derivation of recent equations of state for hydrogen and helium, much denser in
the Mbar region, worsen the conflict between these two observations. In order to circumvent this
puzzle, current Jupiter model studies either ignore the constraint from Galileo or invoke an ad
hoc modification of the equations of state. In this paper, we derive Jupiter models which satisfy
both Juno and Galileo constraints. We confirm that Jupiter's structure must encompass at least
four different regions: an outer convective envelope, a region of compositional, thus entropy
change, an inner convective envelope and an extended diluted core enriched in heavy elements, and
potentially a central compact core. We show that, in order to reproduce Juno and Galileo observations,
one needs a significant entropy increase between the outer and inner envelopes and a smaller density
than for an isentropic profile, associated with some external differential rotation. The best
way to fulfill this latter condition is an inward decreasing abundance of heavy elements in this
region. We examine in details the three physical mechanisms able to yield such a change of entropy
and composition: a first order molecular-metallic hydrogen transition, immiscibility between
hydrogen and helium or a region of layered convection. Given our present knowledge of hydrogen pressure
ionization, combination of the two latter mechanisms seems to be the most favoured solution.
