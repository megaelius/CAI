Aims: Our scientific goal is to provide revised membership lists of the Alpha Per, Pleiades, and
Praesepe clusters exploiting the second data release of Gaia and produce five-dimensional maps
(ra, dec, parallax, pmRA, pmDEC) of these clusters. Methods: We implemented the kinematic method
combined with the statistical treatment of parallaxes and proper motions to identify astrometric
member candidates of three of the most nearby and best studied open clusters in the sky. Results:
We cross-correlated the Gaia catalogue with large-scale public surveys to complement the astrometry
of Gaia with multi-band photometry from the optical to the mid-infrared. We identified 517, 1248,
and 721 bona-fide astrometric member candidates inside the tidal radius of the Alpha Per, the Pleiades,
and Praesepe, respectively. We cross-matched our final samples with catalogues from previous
surveys to address the level of completeness. We update the main physical properties of the clusters,
including mean distance and velocity as well as core, half-mass, and tidal radii. We infer updated
ages from the white dwarf members of the Pleiades and Praesepe. We derive the luminosity and mass
functions of the three clusters and compare them to the field mass function. We compute the positions
in space of all member candidates in the three regions to investigate their distribution in space.
Conclusions: We provide updated distances and kinematics for the three clusters. We identify a
list of members in the Alpha Per, Pleiades, and Praesepe clusters from the most massive stars all
the way down into the hydrogen-burning limit with a higher confidence and better astrometry than
previous studies. We produce complete 5D maps of stellar and substellar bona-fide members in these
three regions. ABRIDGED
