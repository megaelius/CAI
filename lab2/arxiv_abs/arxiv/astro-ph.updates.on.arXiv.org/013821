With the goal of providing more accurate and realistic estimates of the secular behavior of the mass
accretion and drag rates in the "common-envelope" scenario encountered when a black hole or a neutron
star moves in the stellar envelope of a red supergiant star, we have carried out the first general
relativistic simulations of the accretion flow onto a nonrotating black hole moving supersonically
in a medium with regular but different density gradients. The simulations reveal that the supersonic
motion always rapidly reaches a stationary state and it produces a shock cone in the downstream part
of the flow. In the absence of density gradients we recover the phenomenology already observed in
the well-known Bondi--Hoyle--Lyttleton accretion problem, with super-Eddington mass accretion
rate and a shock cone whose axis is stably aligned with the direction of motion. However, as the density
gradient is made stronger, the accretion rate also increases and the shock cone is progressively
and stably dragged toward the direction of motion. With sufficiently large gradients, the shock-cone
axis can become orthogonal to the direction, or even move in the upstream region of the flow in the
case of the largest density gradient. Together with the phenomenological aspects of the accretion
flow, we have also quantified the rates of accretion of mass and momentum onto the black hole. Simple
analytic expressions have been found for the rates of accretion of mass, momentum, drag force, and
bremsstrahlung luminosity, all of which have been employed in the astrophysical modelling of the
secular evolution of a binary system experiencing a common-envelope evolution...
