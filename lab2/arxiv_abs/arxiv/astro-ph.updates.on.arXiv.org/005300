Deriving the Faraday rotation measure (RM) of quasar absorption line systems, which are tracers
of high-redshift galaxies intervening background quasars, is a powerful tool for probing magnetic
fields in distant galaxies. Statistically comparing the RM distributions of two quasar samples,
with and without absorption line systems, allows one to infer magnetic field properties of the intervening
galaxy population. Here, we have derived the analytical form of the probability distribution function
(PDF) of RM produced by a single galaxy with an axisymmetric large-scale magnetic field. We then
further determine the PDF of RM for one random sight line traversing each galaxy in a population with
a large-scale magnetic field prescription. We find that the resulting PDF of RM is dominated by a
Lorentzian with a width that is directly related to the mean axisymmetric large-scale field strength
$\langle B_0 \rangle$ of the galaxy population if the dispersion of $B_0$ within the population
is smaller than $\langle B_0 \rangle$. Provided that RMs produced by the intervening galaxies have
been successfully isolated from other RM contributions along the line of sight, our simple model
suggests that $\langle B_0 \rangle$ in galaxies probed by quasar absorption line systems can be
measured within $\approx50$ per cent accuracy without additional constraints on the magneto-ionic
medium properties of the galaxies. Finally, we discuss quasar sample selection criteria that are
crucial to reliably interpret observations, and argue that within the limitations of the current
database of absorption line systems, high-metallicity damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers are best
suited to study galactic dynamo action in distant disc galaxies.
