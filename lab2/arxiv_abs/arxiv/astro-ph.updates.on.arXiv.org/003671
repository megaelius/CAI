Recent data from the Kepler mission has revealed the occurrence of superflares in sun-like stars
which exceed by far any observed solar flares in release of energy. A natural idea is that the dynamo
mechanism in superflaring stars differs in some respect from that in the Sun. We search for a difference
in the dynamo-related parameters between superflaring stars and the Sun to suggest a dynamo-mechanism
as close as possible to the conventional solar/stellar dynamo but capable of providing much higher
magnetic energy. Dynamo based on joint action of differential rotation and mirror asymmetric motions
can in principle result in excitation of two types of magnetic fields. First of all, it is well-known
in solar physics dynamo waves. The point is that another magnetic configuration with initial growth
and further stabilisation is also possible for excitation. For comparable conditions, magnetic
field strength of second configuration is much larger rather of the first one just because dynamo
do not spend its efforts for periodic magnetic field inversions but use its for magnetic field growth.
We analysed available data from the Kepler mission concerning the superflaring stars in order to
find tracers of anomalous magnetic activity. Starting from the recent paper, we find that anti-solar
differential rotation or anti-solar sign of the mirror-asymmetry of stellar convection can provide
the desired strong magnetic field in dynamo models. We confirm this concept by numerical models
of stellar dynamos with corresponding governing parameters. We conclude that the proposed mechanism
can plausibly explain the superflaring events at least for some cool stars, including binaries,
subgiants and, possibly, low-mass stars and young rapid rotators.
