The morphology of galaxies gives essential constraints on the models of galaxy evolution. The morphology
of the features in the low-surface-brightness regions of galaxies has not been fully explored yet
because of observational difficulties. Here we present the results of our visual inspections of
very deep images of a large volume-limited sample of 177 nearby massive early-type galaxies (ETGs)
from the MATLAS survey. The images reach a surface-brightness limit of $28.5-29$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$
in the $g'$ band. Using a dedicated navigation tool and questionnaire, we looked for structures
at the outskirts of the galaxies such as tidal shells, streams, tails, disturbed outer isophotes
or peripheral star-forming disks, and simultaneously noted the presence of contaminating sources,
such as Galactic cirrus. We also inspected internal sub-structures such as bars and dust lanes.
We discuss the reliability of this visual classification investigating the variety of answers
made by the participants. We present the incidence of these structures and the trends of the incidence
with the mass of the host galaxy and the density of its environment. We find an incidence of shells,
stream and tails of approximately 15%, about the same for each category. For galaxies with masses
over $10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, the incidence of shells and streams increases about 1.7 times. We also
note a strong unexpected anticorrelation of the incidence of Galactic cirrus with the environment
density of the target galaxy. Correlations with other properties of the galaxies, and comparisons
to model predictions, will be presented in future papers.
