We study the alignment of dark matter haloes with the cosmic web characterized by the tidal and velocity
shear fields. We focus on the alignment of their shape, angular momentum and peculiar velocities.
We use a cosmological N-body simulation that allows to study dark matter halos spanning almost five
orders of magnitude in mass ($10^{9}$-$10^{14}$) $h^{-1}$$M_{\odot}$ and spatial scales of $(0.5$-$1.0)$
$h^{-1}$ Mpc to define the cosmic web. We find that the halo shape presents the strongest alignment
along the smallest tidal eigenvector, e.g. along filaments and walls, with a signal that gets stronger
as the halo mass increases. In the case of the velocity shear field only massive halos $>10^{12}$
$h^{-1}$$M_{\odot}$ tend to have their shapes aligned along the largest tidal eigenvector; that
is, perpendicular to filaments and walls. For the angular momentum we find alignment signals only
for halos more massive than $10^{12}$ $h^{-1}$$M_{\odot}$ both in the tidal and velocity shear
webs where the preferences are for it to be parallel to the middle eigenvector; perpendicular to
filaments and parallel to walls. Finally, the peculiar velocities show a strong alignment along
the smallest tidal eigenvector for all halo masses; halos move along filaments and walls. In the
velocity shear the same alignment is present but weaker and only for haloes less massive than $10^{12}$
$h^{-1}$$M_{\odot}$. Our results clearly show that the two different algorithms we used to define
the cosmic web describe different physical aspects of non-linear collapse and should be used in
a complementary way to understand the effect of the cosmic web on galaxy evolution.
