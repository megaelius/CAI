Numerical simulations of magnetosonic wave formation driven by an expanding cylindrical piston
are performed to get better physical insight into the initiation and evolution of large-scale coronal
waves. Several very basic initial configurations are employed to analyze intrinsic characteristics
of the MHD wave formation that do not depend on specific properties of the environment. It turns out
that these simple initial configurations result in piston/wave morphologies and kinematics that
reproduce common characteristics of coronal waves. In the initial stage the wave and the expanding
source-region cannot be clearly resolved. During the acceleration stage of the source-region
inflation, the wave is driven by the piston expansion, so its amplitude and phase-speed increase,
whereas the wavefront profile steepens. At a given point, a discontinuity forms in the wavefront
profile. The time/distance required for the shock formation is shorter for a more impulsive source-region
expansion. After the piston stops, the wave amplitude and phase-speed start decreasing. During
the expansion, most of the source region becomes strongly rarified, which reproduces the coronal
dimming left behind the eruption. On the other hand, the density increases at the source-region
boundary, and stays enhanced even after the expansion stops, which might explain stationary brightenings
that are sometimes observed at the edges of the erupted coronal structure. In addition, in the rear
of the wave a weak density depletion develops, trailing the wave, which is sometimes observed as
weak transient coronal dimming. Finally, we find a well defined relationship between the impulsiveness
of the source-region expansion and the wave amplitude and phase speed. The results for the cylindrical
piston are also compared with the outcome for a planar wave, to find out how different geometries
affect the evolution of the wave.
