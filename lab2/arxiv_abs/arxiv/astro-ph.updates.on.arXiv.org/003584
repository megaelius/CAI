PICARD is a scientific space mission dedicated to the study of the solar variability origin. A French
micro-satellite will carry an imaging telescope for measuring the solar diameter, limb shape and
solar oscillations, and two radiometers for measuring the total solar irradiance and the irradiance
in five spectral domains, from ultraviolet to infrared. The mission is planed to be launched in 2009
for a 3-year duration. This article presents the PICARD Payload Data Centre, which role is to collect,
process and distribute the PICARD data. The Payload Data Centre is a joint project between laboratories,
space agency and industries. The Belgian scientific policy office funds the industrial development
and future operations under the European Space Agency program. The development is achieved by the
SPACEBEL Company. The Belgian operation centre is in charge of operating the PICARD Payload Data
Centre. The French space agency leads the development in partnership with the French scientific
research centre, which is responsible for providing all the scientific algorithms. The architecture
of the PICARD Payload Data Centre (software and hardware) is presented. The software system is based
on a Service Oriented Architecture. The host structure is made up of the basic functions such as data
management, task scheduling and system supervision including a graphical interface used by the
operator to interact with the system. The other functions are mission-specific: data exchange
(acquisition, distribution), data processing (scientific and non-scientific processing) and
managing the payload (programming, monitoring). The PICARD Payload Data Centre is planned to be
operated for 5 years. All the data will be stored into a specific data centre after this period.
