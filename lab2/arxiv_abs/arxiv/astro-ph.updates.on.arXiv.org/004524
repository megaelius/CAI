Substantial effort has been devoted in determining the ideal proxy for quantifying the morphology
of the hot intracluster medium in clusters of galaxies. These proxies, based on X-ray emission,
typically require expensive, high-quality X-ray observations making them difficult to apply
to large surveys of groups and clusters. Here, we compare optical relaxation proxies with X-ray
asymmetries and centroid shifts for a sample of SDSS clusters with high-quality, archival X-ray
data from Chandra and XMM-Newton. The three optical relaxation measures considered are: the shape
of the member-galaxy projected velocity distribution -- measured by the Anderson-Darling (AD)
statistic, the stellar mass gap between the most-massive and second-most-massive cluster galaxy,
and the offset between the most-massive galaxy (MMG) position and the luminosity-weighted cluster
centre. The AD statistic and stellar mass gap correlate significantly with X-ray relaxation proxies,
with the AD statistic being the stronger correlator. Conversely, we find no evidence for a correlation
between X-ray asymmetry or centroid shift and the MMG offset. High-mass clusters ($M_\mathrm{halo}
> 10^{14.5}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$) in this sample have X-ray asymmetries, centroid shifts, and
Anderson-Darling statistics which are systematically larger than for low-mass systems. Finally,
considering the dichotomy of Gaussian and non-Gaussian clusters (measured by the AD test), we show
that the probability of being a non-Gaussian cluster correlates significantly with X-ray asymmetry
but only shows a marginal correlation with centroid shift. These results confirm the shape of the
radial velocity distribution as a useful proxy for cluster relaxation, which can then be applied
to large redshift surveys lacking extensive X-ray coverage.
