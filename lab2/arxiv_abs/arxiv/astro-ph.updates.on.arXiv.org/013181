Due to its powerful radiation over the entire electromagnetic spectrum and its radio jet activity,
the blazar 3C273 offers the opportunity to study the physics of $\gamma$-ray emission from active
galactic nuclei. Since a historically strong outburst in 2009, 3C273 showed relatively weak emission
in the gamma-ray band over multiple years. However, recent Fermi-Large Area Telescope observations
indicate elevated activity during 2015-2019. We aim at constraining the origin of the gamma-ray
outbursts towards 3C273 and investigate their connection to the parsec-scale jet. We generate
Fermi-LAT gamma-ray light curves with multiple binning intervals and study the spectral properties
of the gamma-ray emission. Using a 3-mm ALMA light curve, we study the correlation between radio
and gamma-ray emission. Relevant activity in the parsec-scale jet of 3C273 is investigated with
7-mm VLBA observations obtained close in time to notable gamma-ray outbursts. We find two prominent
gamma-ray outbursts in 2016 (MJD 57382) and 2017 (MJD 57883) accompanied by mm-wavelength flaring
activity. The gamma-ray photon index time series show a weak hump-like feature around the gamma-ray
outbursts. The monthly gamma-ray flux-index plot indicates a transition from softer-when-brighter
to harder-when-brighter at $1.03\times10^{-7}\rm\,ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}$. A significant correlation
between the gamma-ray and mm-wavelength emission is found, with the radio lagging the gamma-rays
by about 105-112 days. The 43-GHz jet images reveal the known stationary features (i.e., the core,
S1, and S2) in a region upstream of the jet. We find indication for a propagating disturbance and a
polarized knot between the stationary components around the times of both gamma-ray outbursts.
