The anomalous concentration of radiocarbon in 774/775 attracted intense discussion on its origin,
including the possible extreme solar event(s) exceeding any events in observational history.
Anticipating such extreme solar events, auroral records were also surveyed in historical documents
and those including the red celestial sign after sunset in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (ASC) were
subjected to consideration. Usoskin et al. (2013: U13) interpreted this record as an aurora and
suggested enhanced solar activity around 774/775. Conversely, Neuhauser and Neuhauser (2015a,
2015b: N15a and N15b) interpreted "after sunset" as during sunset or twilight; they considered
this sign as a halo display and suggested a solar minimum around 774. However, so far these records
have not been discussed in comparison with eyewitness auroral records during the known extreme
space-weather events, although they were discussed in relationship with potential extreme events
in 774/775. Therefore, we reconstruct the observational details based on the original records
in the ASC and philological references, compare them with eyewitness auroral observations during
known extreme space-weather events, and consider contemporary solar activity. We clarify the
observation was indeed "after sunset", reject the solar halo hypothesis, define the observational
time span between 25 Mar. 775 and 25 Dec. 777, and note the parallel halo drawing in 806 in the ASC shown
in N15b was not based on the original observation in England. We show examples of eyewitness auroral
observations during twilight in known space-weather events, and this celestial sign does not contradict
the observational evidence. Accordingly, we consider this event happened after the onset of the
event in 774/775, but shows relatively enhanced solar activity, with other historical auroral
records in the mid-770s, as also confirmed by the Be data from ice cores.
