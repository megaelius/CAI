Supermassive black hole feedback is thought to be responsible for the lack of star formation, or
quiescence, in a significant fraction of galaxies. We explore how observable correlations between
the specific star formation rate (sSFR), stellar mass (M$_{\rm{star}}$), and black hole mass (M$_{\rm{BH}}$)
are sensitive to the physics of black hole feedback in a galaxy formation model. We use the IllustrisTNG
simulation suite, specifically the TNG100 simulation and ten model variations that alter the parameters
of the black hole model. Focusing on central galaxies at $z = 0$ with M$_{\rm{star}} > 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$,
we find that the sSFR of galaxies in IllustrisTNG decreases once the energy from black hole kinetic
winds at low accretion rates becomes larger than the gravitational binding energy of gas within
the galaxy stellar radius. This occurs at a particular M$_{\rm{BH}}$ threshold above which galaxies
are found to sharply transition from being mostly star-forming to mostly quiescent. As a result
of this behavior, the fraction of quiescent galaxies as a function of M$_{\rm{star}}$ is sensitive
to both the normalization of the M$_{\rm{BH}}$-M$_{\rm{star}}$ relation and the M$_{\rm{BH}}$
threshold for quiescence in IllustrisTNG. Finally, we compare these model results to observations
of 91 central galaxies with dynamical M$_{\rm{BH}}$ measurements with the caveat that this sample
is not representative of the whole galaxy population. While IllustrisTNG reproduces the observed
trend that quiescent galaxies host more massive black holes, the observations exhibit a broader
scatter in M$_{\rm{BH}}$ at a given M$_{\rm{star}}$ and show a smoother decline in sSFR with M$_{\rm{BH}}$.
