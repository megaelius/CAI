Ultraviolet nebular emission lines are important for understanding the time evolution and nucleosynthetic
origins of their associated elements, but the underlying trends of their relative abundances are
unclear. We present UV spectroscopy of 20 nearby low-metallicity, high-ionization dwarf galaxies
obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope. Building upon previous studies, we analyze the C/O relationship
for a combined sample of 40 galaxies with significant detections of the UV O+2/C+2 collisionally-excited
lines and direct-method oxygen abundance measurements. Using new analytic carbon ionization
correction factor relationships, we confirm the flat trend in C/O versus O/H observed for local
metal-poor galaxies. We find an average log(C/O) = -0.71 with an intrinsic dispersion of {\sigma}
= 0.17 dex. The C/N ratio also appears to be constant at log(C/N) = 0.75, plus significant scatter
({\sigma} = 0.20 dex), with the result that carbon and nitrogen show similar evolutionary trends.
This large and real scatter in C/O over a large range in O/H implies that measuring the UV C and O emission
lines alone does not provide a reliable indicator of the O/H abundance. By modeling the chemical
evolution of C, N, and O of individual targets, we find that the C/O ratio is very sensitive to both
the detailed star formation history and to supernova feedback. Longer burst durations and lower
star formation efficiencies correspond to low C/O ratios, while the escape of oxygen atoms in supernovae
winds produces decreased effective oxygen yields and larger C/O ratios. Further, a declining C/O
relationship is seen with increasing baryonic mass due to increasing effective oxygen yields.
