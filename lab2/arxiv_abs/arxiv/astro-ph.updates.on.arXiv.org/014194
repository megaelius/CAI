Here we aim to characterise submillimetre water masers at 437, 439, 471, and 474 GHz towards a sample
of evolved stars. We used the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) to observe submillimetre water
transitions and the CO (4-3) line towards 11 evolved stars. The sample included semi-regular and
Mira variables, plus a red supergiant star. We performed radiative transfer modelling for the water
masers. We also used the CO observations to determine mass loss rates for the stars. From the sample
of 11 evolved stars, 7 display one or more of the masers at 437, 439, 471, and 474 GHz. We therefore find
that these masers are common in evolved star circumstellar envelopes. The fact that the maser lines
are detected near the stellar velocity indicates that they are likely to originate from the inner
circumstellar envelopes of our targets. We tentatively link the presence of masers to the degree
of variability of the target star, that is, masers are more likely to be present in Mira variables
than in semi-regular variables. We suggest that this indicates the importance of strong shocks
in creating the necessary conditions for the masers. Typically, the 437 GHz line is the strongest
maser line observed among those studied here. We cannot reproduce the above finding in our radiative
transfer models. In general, we find that maser emission is very sensitive to dust temperature in
the lines studied here. To produce strong maser emission, the dust temperature must be significantly
lower than the gas kinetic temperature. In addition to running grids of models in order to determine
the optimum physical conditions for strong masers in these lines, we performed smooth wind modelling
for which we cannot reproduce the observed line shapes. This also suggests that the masers must originate
predominantly from the inner envelopes.
