[Aims:] We present r-Java 2.0, a nucleosynthesis code for open use that performs r-process calculations
as well as a suite of other analysis tools. [Methods:] Equipped with a straightforward graphical
user interface, r-Java 2.0 is capable of; simulating nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE), calculating
r-process abundances for a wide range of input parameters and astrophysical environments, computing
the mass fragmentation from neutron-induced fission as well as the study of individual nucleosynthesis
processes. [Results:] In this paper we discuss enhancements made to this version of r-Java, paramount
of which is the ability to solve the full reaction network. The sophisticated fission methodology
incorporated into r-Java 2.0 which includes three fission channels (beta-delayed, neutron-induced
and spontaneous fission) as well as computation of the mass fragmentation is compared to the upper
limit on mass fission approximation. The effects of including beta-delayed neutron emission on
r-process yield is studied. The role of coulomb interactions in NSE abundances is shown to be significant,
supporting previous findings. A comparative analysis was undertaken during the development of
r-Java 2.0 whereby we reproduced the results found in literature from three other r-process codes.
This code is capable of simulating the physical environment of; the high-entropy wind around a proto-neutron
star, the ejecta from a neutron star merger or the relativistic ejecta from a quark nova. As well the
users of r-Java 2.0 are given the freedom to define a custom environment. This software provides
an even platform for comparison of different proposed r-process sites and is available for download
