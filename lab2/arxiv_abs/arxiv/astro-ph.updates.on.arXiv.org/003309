We spectroscopically characterize the atmosphere of HD 106906b, a young low-mass companion near
the deuterium burning limit. The wide separation to its host star of 7.1" makes it an ideal candidate
for high-SNR and high-resolution spectroscopy. We aim to derive new constraints on HD 106906b's
spectral type, effective temperature, and luminosity, and also provide a high-SNR template spectrum
for future characterization of extrasolar planets. We obtained 1.1--2.5 $\mu$m integral field
spectroscopy with the VLT/SINFONI instrument with a spectral resolution of R$\approx$2000--4000.
New estimates of HD 106906b's parameters are derived by analyzing spectral features, comparing
to spectral catalogs of other low-mass objects, and fitting with theoretical isochrones. We identify
several spectral absorption lines that are consistent with a low mass for HD 106906b. We derive a
new spectral type of L1.5$\pm$1.0, one subclass earlier than previous estimates. Through comparison
with other young low-mass objects, this translates to a luminosity of log($L/L_\odot$)=$-3.65\pm0.08$
and an effective temperature of Teff = $1820\pm240$ K. Our new mass estimates range between $M=11.9^{+1.7}_{-0.8}$
$M_{\rm Jup}$ (hot start) and $M=14.0^{+0.2}_{-0.5}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ (cold start). These limits
take into account a possibly finite formation time, i.e., HD 106906b is allowed to be 0--3 Myr younger
than its host star. We exclude accretion onto HD 106906b at rates $\dot{M}>4.8\times10^{-10}$
$M_{\rm Jup}$yr$^{-1}$ based on the fact that we observe no hydrogen (Paschen-$\beta$, Brackett-$\gamma$)
emission. This is indicative of little or no circumplanetary gas. With our new observations, HD
106906b is the planetary-mass object with one of the highest SNR spectra yet. We make the spectrum
available for download for future comparison with data from existing and next-generation (e.g,
ELT, JWST) spectrographs.
