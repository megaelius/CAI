The planetary building blocks that formed in the terrestrial planet region were likely very dry,
yet water is comparatively abundant on Earth. We review the various mechanisms proposed for the
origin of water on the terrestrial planets. Various in-situ mechanisms have been suggested, which
allow for the incorporation of water into the local planetesimals in the terrestrial planet region
or into the planets themselves from local sources, although all of those mechanisms have difficulties.
Comets have also been proposed as a source, although there may be problems fitting isotopic constraints,
and the delivery efficiency is very low, such that it may be difficult to deliver even a single Earth
ocean of water this way. The most promising route for water delivery is the accretion of material
from beyond the snow line, similar to carbonaceous chondrites, that is scattered into the terrestrial
planet region as the planets are growing. Two main scenarios are discussed in detail. First is the
classical scenario in which the giant planets begin roughly in their final locations and the disk
of planetesimals and embryos in the terrestrial planet region extends all the way into the outer
asteroid belt region. Second is the Grand Tack scenario, where early inward and outward migration
of the giant planets implants material from beyond the snow line into the asteroid belt and terrestrial
planet region, where it can be accreted by the growing planets. Sufficient water is delivered to
the terrestrial planets in both scenarios. While the Grand Tack scenario provides a better fit to
most constraints, namely the small mass of Mars, planets may form too fast in the nominal case discussed
here. This discrepancy may be reduced as a wider range of initial conditions is explored. Finally,
we discuss several more recent models that may have important implications for water delivery to
the terrestrial planets.
