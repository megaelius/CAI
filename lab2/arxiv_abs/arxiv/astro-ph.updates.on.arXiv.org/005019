We analyze the properties of a sample of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) detected by the Fermi satellite
that have a spectroscopic redshift and good follow-up coverage at both X-ray and optical/nIR wavelengths.
The evolution of LGRB afterglows depends on the density profile of the external medium, enabling
us to separate wind or ISM-like environments based on the observations. We do this by identifying
the environment that provides the best agreement between estimates of $p$, the index of the underlying
power-law distribution of electron energies, as determined by the behavior of the afterglow in
different spectral/temporal regimes. At 11 rest-frame hours after trigger, we find a roughly even
split between ISM-like and wind-like environments. We further find a 2$\sigma$ separation in the
prompt emission energy distributions of wind-like and ISM-like bursts. We investigate the underlying
physical parameters of the shock, and calculate the (degenerate) product of density and magnetic
field energy ($\epsilon_B$). We show that $\epsilon_B$ must be $\ll 10^{-2}$ to avoid implied densities
comparable to the intergalactic medium. Finally, we find that the most precisely constrained observations
disagree on $p$ by more than would be expected based on observational errors alone. This suggests
additional sources of error that are not incorporated in the standard afterglow theory. For the
first time, we provide a measurement of this intrinsic error which can be represented as an error
in the estimate of $p$ of magnitude $0.25 \pm 0.04$. When this error is included in the fits, the number
of LGRBs with an identified environment drops substantially, but the equal division between the
two types remains.
