We present an optical-to-infrared transmission spectrum of the inflated sub-Saturn-mass exoplanet
KELT-11b measured with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) G141 spectroscopic grism, and the Spitzer Space Telescope (Spitzer)
at 3.6 $\mu$m, in addition to a Spitzer 4.5 $\mu$m secondary eclipse. The precise HST transmission
spectrum notably reveals a low-amplitude water feature with an unusual shape. We apply a suite of
modeling tools to the transmission spectrum to investigate the planet's properties. Based on a
retrieval analysis with varying molecular abundances, we find strong evidence for water absorption
in the spectrum and tentative evidence for other absorbers (HCN, TiO, and AlO) depending on model
assumptions. The retrieved water abundance is generally $\lesssim 0.1\times$ solar (0.001--0.7$\times$
solar over a range of model assumptions), which is several orders of magnitude lower than expected
from planet formation models based on the solar system metallicity trend. We also consider chemical
equilibrium and self-consistent 1D radiative-convective equilibrium model fits and find that
they too prefer low metallicities ($[M/H] \lesssim -2$, consistent with the free retrieval results);
however, the equilibrium models fit poorly and should be interpreted with caution. Finally, we
find that the dayside flux measured from the Spitzer secondary eclipse is indicative of full heat
redistribution from KELT-11b's dayside to nightside, assuming the dayside is not cloudy. Altogether,
the unusual results for KELT-11b's composition are suggestive of new challenges on the horizon
for atmosphere and formation models in the face of increasingly precise measurements of exoplanet
spectra.
