We discover four high proper motion L dwarfs by comparing the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer
(WISE) to the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). WISE J140533.32+835030.5 is an L dwarf at the L/T
transition with a proper motion of 0.85+/-0.02" yr^-1, previously overlooked due to its proximity
to a bright star (V=12 mag). From optical spectroscopy we find a spectral type of L8, and from moderate-resolution
J band spectroscopy we find a near-infrared spectral type of L9. We find WISE J140533.32+835030.5
to have a distance of 9.7+/-1.7 pc, bringing the number of L dwarfs at the L/T transition within 10
pc from six to seven. WISE J040137.21+284951.7, WISE J040418.01+412735.6, and WISE J062442.37+662625.6
are all early L dwarfs within 25 pc, and were classified using optical and low-resolution near-infrared
spectra. WISE J040418.01+412735.6 is an L2 pec (red) dwarf, a member of the class of unusually red
L dwarfs. We use follow-up optical and low-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy to classify
a previously discovered (Castro & Gizis 2012) fifth object WISEP J060738.65+242953.4 as an
(L8 Opt/L9 NIR), confirming it as an L dwarf at the L/T transition within 10 pc. WISEP J060738.65+242953.4
shows tentative CH_4 in the H band, possibly the result of unresolved binarity with an early T dwarf,
a scenario not supported by binary spectral template fitting. If WISEP J060738.65+242953.4 is
a single object, it represents the earliest onset of CH_4 in the H band of an L/T transition dwarf in
the SpeX Library. As very late L dwarfs within 10 pc, WISE J140533.32+835030.5 and WISEP J060738.65+242953.4
will play a vital role in resolving outstanding issues at the L/T transition.
