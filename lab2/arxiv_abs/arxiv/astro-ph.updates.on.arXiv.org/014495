We investigate how each aspect of a multi-channel stellar feedback model drives the chemodynamical
evolution of a low-mass, isolated dwarf galaxy using a suite of high-resolution simulations. Our
model follows individual star particles sampled randomly from an adopted initial mass function,
considering independently feedback from: supernovae; stellar radiation causing photoelectric
heating of dust grains, ionization and associated heating, Lyman-Werner (LW) dissociation of
H$_2$, and radiation pressure; and winds from massive main sequence (neglecting their energy input)
and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Radiative transfer is done by ray tracing. We consider
the effects each of these processes have on regulating the star formation rate, global properties,
multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM), and driving of galactic winds. We follow individual metal
species from distinct nucleosynthetic enrichment channels (AGB winds, massive star stellar winds,
core collapse and Type Ia supernovae) and pay particular attention to how these feedback processes
regulate metal mixing in the ISM, the metal content of outflows, and the stellar abundance patterns
in our galaxy. We find that---for a low-metallicity, low-mass dwarf galaxy ---stellar radiation,
particularly ionizing radiation and LW radiation, are important sources of stellar feedback whose
effects dominate over photoelectric heating and HI radiation pressure. However, feedback is coupled
non-linearly, and the inclusion or exclusion of each process produces non-negligible effects.
We find strong variations with: the star formation history; the ejection fractions of metals, mass,
and energy; and the distribution of elements from different nucleosynthetic sources in both the
gas and stars.
