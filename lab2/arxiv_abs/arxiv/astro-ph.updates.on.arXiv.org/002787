We have recently shown (Ibata et al. 2014) that pairs of satellite galaxies located diametrically
opposite each other around their host possess predominantly anti-correlated velocities. This
is consistent with a scenario in which $\sim 50$% of satellite galaxies belong to kinematically-coherent
rotating planar structures, similar to those detected around the giant galaxies of the Local Group.
Here we extend this analysis, examining the incidence of satellites of giant galaxies drawn from
an SDSS photometric redshift catalog. We find that there is a $\sim 17$% overabundance ($> 3 \sigma$
significance) of candidate satellites at positions diametrically opposite a spectroscopically
confirmed satellite. We show that cosmological simulations do not possess this property when the
contamination is included, and that there are in fact, after subtracting contamination, 2 to 3 times
more satellites diametrically opposed to a spectroscopically confirmed satellite than at $90\deg$
from it. We also examine the correlation between the satellite pair positions and the orientation
of the host galaxy major axis. We find that those satellite pairs with anti-correlated velocities
have a strong preference ($\sim 3:1$) to align with the major axis of the host whereas those with correlated
velocities display the opposite behavior. This correlation of the satellite alignments appears
to be stronger than the well-documented preference of satellites to be located close to the major
axis of their host. We finally show that repeating a similar analysis to Ibata et al. (2014) with same-side
satellites is generally hard to interpret, but is not inconsistent with our previous results when
strong quality-cuts are applied on the sample. All these unexpected correlations strongly suggest
that a substantial fraction of satellite galaxies are causally-linked in their formation and evolution.
