We present results from the "Weather on Other Worlds" Spitzer Exploration Science program to investigate
photometric variability in L and T dwarfs, usually attributed to patchy clouds. We surveyed 44 L3-T8
dwarfs, spanning a range of $J-K_s$ colors and surface gravities. We find that 14/23 (61%; 95% confidence
interval: 41%-78%) of our single L3-L9.5 dwarfs are variable with peak-to-peak amplitudes between
0.2% and 1.5%, and 5/16 (31%; 95% confidence interval: 14%-56%) of our single T0-T8 dwarfs are variable
with amplitudes between 0.8% and 4.6%. After correcting for sensitivity, we find that 80% (95% confidence
interval: 53%-100%) of L dwarfs vary by >0.2%, and 36% (95% confidence interval: 19%-52%) of
T dwarfs vary by >0.4%. Given viewing geometry considerations, we conclude that photospheric
heterogeneities causing >0.2% 3-5-micron flux variations are present on virtually all L dwarfs,
and probably on most T dwarfs. A third of L dwarf variables show irregular light curves, indicating
that L dwarfs may have multiple spots that evolve over a single rotation. Also, approximately a third
of the periodicities are on time scales >10 h, suggesting that slowly-rotating brown dwarfs
may be common. We observe an increase in the maximum amplitudes over the entire spectral type range,
revealing a potential for greater temperature contrasts in T dwarfs than in L dwarfs. We find a tentative
association (92% confidence) between low surface gravity and high-amplitude variability among
L3-L5.5 dwarfs. Although we can not confirm whether lower gravity is also correlated with a higher
incidence of variables, the result is promising for the characterization of directly imaged young
extrasolar planets through variability.
