Embryos of the Moon and the Earth may have formed as a result of contraction of a common parental rarefied
condensation. The required angular momentum of this condensation could largely be acquired in
a collision of two rarefied condensations producing the parental condensation. With the subsequent
growth of embryos of the Moon and the Earth taken into account, the total mass of as-formed embryos
needed to reach the current angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system could be below 0.01 of the Earth
mass. For the low lunar iron abundance to be reproduced with the growth of originally iron-depleted
embryos of the Moon and the Earth just by the accretion of planetesimals, the mass of the lunar embryo
should have increased by a factor of 1.3 at the most. The maximum increase in the mass of the Earth embryo
due to the accumulation of planetesimals in a gas-free medium is then threefold, and the current
terrestrial iron abundance is not attained. If the embryos are assumed to have grown just by accumulating
solid planetesimals (without the ejection of matter from the embryos), it is hard to reproduce the
current lunar and terrestrial iron abundances at any initial abundance in the embryos. For the current
lunar iron abundance to be reproduced, the amount of matter ejected from the Earth embryo and infalling
onto the Moon embryo should have been an order of magnitude larger than the sum of the overall mass
of planetesimals infalling directly on the Moon embryo and the initial mass of the Moon embryo, which
had formed from the parental condensation, if the original embryo had the same iron abundance as
the planetesimals. The greater part of matter incorporated into the Moon embryo could be ejected
from the Earth in its multiple collisions with planetesimals (and smaller bodies).
