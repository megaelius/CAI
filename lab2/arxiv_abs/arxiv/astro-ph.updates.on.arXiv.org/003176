We present the analysis of the fundamental plane (FP) for a sample of 19 massive red-sequence galaxies
($M_{\star} >4\times10^{10} M_{\odot}$) in 3 known overdensities at $1.39<z<1.61$ from the KMOS
Cluster Survey, a guaranteed time program with spectroscopy from the K-band Multi-Object Spectrograph
(KMOS) at the VLT and imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope. As expected, we find that the FP zero-point
in $B$ band evolves with redshift, from the value 0.443 of Coma to $-0.10\pm0.09$, $-0.19\pm0.05$,
$-0.29\pm0.12$ for our clusters at $z=1.39$, $z=1.46$, and $z=1.61$, respectively. For the most
massive galaxies ($\log M_{\star}/M_{\odot}>11$) in our sample, we translate the FP zero-point
evolution into a mass-to-light-ratio $M/L$ evolution finding $\Delta \log M/L_{B}=(-0.46\pm0.10)z$,
$\Delta \log M/L_{B}=(-0.52\pm0.07)z$, to $\Delta \log M/L_{B}=(-0.55\pm0.10)z$, respectively.
We assess the potential contribution of the galaxies structural and stellar velocity dispersion
evolution to the evolution of the FP zero-point and find it to be $\sim$6-35 % of the FP zero-point
evolution. The rate of $M/L$ evolution is consistent with galaxies evolving passively. By using
single stellar population models, we find an average age of $2.33^{+0.86}_{-0.51}$ Gyr for the
$\log M_{\star}/M_{\odot}>11$ galaxies in our massive and virialized cluster at $z=1.39$, $1.59^{+1.40}_{-0.62}$
Gyr in a massive but not virialized cluster at $z=1.46$, and $1.20^{+1.03}_{-0.47}$ Gyr in a protocluster
at $z=1.61$. After accounting for the difference in the age of the Universe between redshifts, the
ages of the galaxies in the three overdensities are consistent within the errors, with possibly
a weak suggestion that galaxies in the most evolved structure are older.
