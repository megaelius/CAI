We report the discovery of a highly eccentric, double-lined spectroscopic binary star system (TYC
3010-1494-1), comprising two solar-type stars that we had initially identified as a single star
with a brown dwarf companion. At the moderate resolving power of the MARVELS spectrograph and the
spectrographs used for subsequent radial-velocity (RV) measurements (R ~ <30,000), this particular
stellar binary mimics a single-lined binary with an RV signal that would be induced by a brown dwarf
companion (Msin(i)~50 M_Jup) to a solar-type primary. At least three properties of this system
allow it to masquerade as a single star with a very low-mass companion: its large eccentricity (e~0.8),
its relatively long period (P~238 days), and the approximately perpendicular orientation of the
semi-major axis with respect to the line of sight (omega~189 degrees). As a result of these properties,
for ~95% of the orbit the two sets of stellar spectral lines are completely blended, and the RV measurements
based on centroiding on the apparently single-lined spectrum is very well fit by an orbit solution
indicative of a brown dwarf companion on a more circular orbit (e~0.3). Only during the ~5% of the
orbit near periastron passage does the true, double-lined nature and large RV amplitude of ~15 km/s
reveal itself. The discovery of this binary system is an important lesson for RV surveys searching
for substellar companions; at a given resolution and observing cadence, a survey will be susceptible
to these kinds of astrophysical false positives for a range of orbital parameters. Finally, for
surveys like MARVELS that lack the resolution for a useful line bisector analysis, it is imperative
to monitor the peak of the cross-correlation function for suspicious changes in width or shape,
so that such false positives can be flagged during the candidate vetting process.
