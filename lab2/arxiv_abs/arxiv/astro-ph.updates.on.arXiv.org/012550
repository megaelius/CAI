We report the first spectroscopic observations of a background star seen through the region between
the ionization front and the dissociation front of the nebula IC 63. This photodissociation region
(PDR) exhibits intense extended red emission (ERE) attributed to fluorescence by large molecules/ions.
We detected strong diffuse interstellar bands (DIB) in the stellar spectrum, including an exceptionally
strong and broad DIB at $\lambda$4428. The detection of strong DIBs in association with ERE could
be consistent with the suggestion that the carriers of DIBs and ERE are identical. The likely ERE
process is recurrent fluorescence, enabled by inverse internal conversions from highly excited
vibrational levels of the ground state to low-lying electronic states with subsequent transitions
to ground. This provides a path to rapid radiative cooling for molecules/molecular ions, greatly
enhancing their ability to survive in a strongly irradiated environment. The ratio of the equivalent
widths (EW) of DIBs $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$5780 in IC 63 is the same as that observed in the low-density
interstellar medium with UV interstellar radiation fields (ISRF) weaker by at least two orders
of magnitude. This falsifies suggestions that the ratio of these two DIBs can serve as a measure of
the UV strength of the ISRF. Observations of the nebular spectrum of the PDR of IC 63 at locations immediately
adjacent to where DIBs were detected failed to reveal any presence of sharp emission features seen
in the spectrum of the Red Rectangle nebula. This casts doubts upon proposals that the carriers of
these features are the same as those of DIBs seen at slightly shorter wavelengths.
