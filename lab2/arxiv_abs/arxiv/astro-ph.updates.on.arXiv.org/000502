Long soft gamma ray bursts (LGRBs) are usually associated with the death of the most massive stars.
A large amount of core angular momentum in the phases preceding the explosion is required to form
LGRBs. A very high initial rotational velocity can provide this angular momentum. Such a velocity
strongly influences the way the star evolves: it is chemically homogeneously mixed and evolves
directly towards the blue part of the HR diagram from the main sequence. We have shown that chemically
homogeneous evolution (CHE) takes place in the SMC, at low metallicity. We want to see if there is
a metallicity threshold above which such an evolution does not exist. We perform a spectroscopic
analysis of H-rich early-type WN stars in the LMC and the Galaxy. We use the code CMFGEN to determine
the fundamental properties and the surface composition of the target stars. We then place the stars
in the HR diagram and determine their evolution. We show that both the LMC and Galactic WNh stars we
selected cannot be explained by standard stellar evolution. They are located on the left of the main
sequence but show surface abundances typical of CN equilibrium. In addition, they still contain
a large amount of hydrogen. They are thus core-H burning objects. Their properties are consistent
with CHE. We determine the metallicity of the Galactic stars from their position and Galactic metallicity
gradients, and conclude that they have 0.6<Z<1.0. A moderate coupling between the core and
the envelope is required to explain that stellar winds do not extract to much angular momentum to
prevent a blueward evolution. In view of the findings that some long gamma ray bursts appear in solar
environments, CHE may be a viable way to form them over a wide range of metallicities.
