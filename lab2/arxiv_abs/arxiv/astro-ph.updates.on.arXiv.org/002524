Using a sample of 299 Ha-selected galaxies at z~0.8, we study the relationship between galaxy stellar
mass, gas-phase metallicity, and star formation rate (SFR), and compare to previous results. We
use deep optical spectra obtained with the IMACS spectrograph at the Magellan telescope to measure
strong oxygen lines. We combine these spectra and metallicities with (1) rest-frame UV-to-optical
imaging, which allows us to determine stellar masses and dust attenuation corrections, and (2)
Ha narrowband imaging, which provides a robust measure of the instantaneous SFR. Our sample spans
stellar masses of 10^9 to 6*10^11 solar masses, SFRs of 0.4 to 270 solar masses per year, and metal
abundances of 12+log(O/H)~8.3-9.1 (~0.4-2.6 solar metallicity). The correlations that we find
between the Ha-based SFR and stellar mass (i.e., the star-forming "main sequence"), and between
the stellar mass and metallicity, are both consistent with previous z~1 studies of star-forming
galaxies. We then study the relationship between the three properties using various plane-fitting
techniques (Lara-Lopez et al.) and a curve-fitting projection (Mannucci et al.). In all cases,
we exclude strong dependence of the M-Z relation on SFR, but are unable to distinguish between moderate
and no dependence. Our results are consistent with previous mass-metallicity-SFR studies. We
check whether dataset limitations may obscure a strong dependence on the SFR by using mock samples
drawn from the SDSS. These experiments reveal that the adopted signal-to-noise cuts may have a significant
effect on the measured dependence. Further work is needed to investigate these results, and to test
whether a "fundamental metallicity relation" or a "fundamental plane" describes star-forming
galaxies across cosmic time.
