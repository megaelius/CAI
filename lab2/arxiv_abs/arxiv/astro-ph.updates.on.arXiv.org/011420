We examine the properties of damped Lyman-${\alpha}$ absorbers (DLAs) emerging from a single set
of cosmological initial conditions in two state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamic simulations:
Simba and Technicolor Dawn. The former includes star formation and black hole feedback treatments
that yield a good match with low-redshift galaxy properties, while the latter uses multi-frequency
radiative transfer to model an inhomogeneous ultraviolet background (UVB) self-consistently
and is calibrated to match the Thomson scattering optical depth, UVB amplitude, and Lyman-${\alpha}$
forest mean transmission at z $>$ 5. Both simulations are in reasonable agreement with the measured
stellar mass and star formation rate functions at z $\geq$ 3, and both reproduce the observed neutral
hydrogen cosmological mass density, $\Omega_{\rm HI}(z)$. However, the DLA abundance and metallicity
distribution are sensitive to the galactic outflows feedback and the UVB amplitude. Adopting a
strong UVB and/or slow outflows under-produces the observed DLA abundance, but yields broad agreement
with the observed DLA metallicity distribution. By contrast, faster outflows eject metals to larger
distances, yielding more metal-rich DLAs whose observational selection may be more sensitive
to dust bias. The DLA metallicity distribution in models adopting an H2-regulated star formation
recipe includes a tail extending to [M/H] $\ll$ -3, lower than any DLA observed to date, owing to curtailed
star formation in low-metallicity galaxies. Our results show that DLA observations play an important
role in constraining key physical ingredients in galaxy formation models, complementing traditional
ensemble statistics such as the stellar mass and star formation rate functions.
