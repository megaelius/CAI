Phosphorus-bearing species are an essential key to form life on Earth, however they have barely
been detected in the interstellar medium. Since only PN and PO have been identified so far towards
star-forming regions, the chemical formation pathways of P-bearing molecules are not easy to constrain
and are thus highly debatable. An important factor still missing in the chemical models is the initial
elemental abundance of phosphorus, i.e. the depletion level of P. In order to overcome this problem,
we study P-bearing species in diffuse/translucent clouds. In these objects phosphorus is mainly
in the gas phase and therefore the elemental initial abundance needed in our chemical simulations
corresponds to the cosmic one and is thus well constrained. An advanced chemical model with an updated
P-chemistry network has been used. Single-pointing observations were performed with the IRAM
30m telescope towards the line of sight to the blazar B0355+508 aiming for the (2-1) transitions
of PN, PO, HCP and CP. This line of sight incorporates five diffuse/translucent clouds. The (2-1)
transitions of the PN, PO, HCP and CP were not detected. We report detections of the (1-0) lines of
$\mathrm{^{13}CO}$, HNC and CN along with a first detection of $\mathrm{C^{34}S}$. We have reproduced
the observations of HNC, CN, CS and CO in every cloud by applying typical conditions for diffuse/translucent
clouds. According to our best-fit model, the most abundant P-bearing species are HCP and CP ($\sim10^{-10}$),
followed by PN, PO and $\mathrm{PH_3}$ ($\sim10^{-11}$). We show that the production of P-bearing
species is favoured towards translucent rather than diffuse clouds, where the environment provides
a stronger shielding from the interstellar radiation. Based on our improved model, the (1-0) transitions
of HCP, CP, PN and PO are expected to be detectable with estimated intensities up to $\sim200$ mK.
