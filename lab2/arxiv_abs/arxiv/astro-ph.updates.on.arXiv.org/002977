We observed the galactic high-mass star forming region W33 using the NANTEN2 and Nobeyama 45-m telescopes
in the $J=$1--0 transitions of the $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O emissions. Our CO data identified
three velocity clouds at 35 km s$^{-1}$, 45 km s$^{-1}$, and 58 km s$^{-1}$ toward W33. The 35 km s$^{-1}$
cloud is spatially coincident with W33, while the 45 km s$^{-1}$ shows diffuse and extended CO emission
for a large are including W33. The 58 km s$^{-1}$ cloud has an arc-like structure, which appears to
be surrounding the 35 km s$^{-1}$ cloud and W33 along the line-of-sight. Among these three, the 35
km s$^{-1}$ and 58 km s$^{-1}$ clouds show spatial correlations with the infrared and radio continuum
emissions from the high-mass star forming regions in W33 including W33 Main, W33 A, and W33 B. In addition
these two clouds have $^{12}$CO $J=$ 3--2 to $^{12}$CO $J=$1--0 intensity ratios higher than 0.8
due to the ultraviolet radiation by the OB stars in W33. These observed properties strongly indicate
that the 35 km s$^{-1}$ and 58 km s$^{-1}$ clouds are physically associated with W33 despite of a large
velocity separation of 23 km s$^{-1}$. The velocity separation of 23 km s$^{-1}$ is too large to be
gravitational bound and also is not explained by expanding motion by stellar feedback. Alternatively,
we postulate a scenario that a collision between the 35 km s$^{-1}$ and 58 km s$^{-1}$ clouds occurred
about 1.0 Myr ago. Finally, we discussed that it is possible that the high-mass star forming regions
embedded within W33 were formed in the dense compressed layer created through the cloud-cloud collision.
