We identify 233 X-ray sources, of which 95 are new, in a 222 ks exposure of Omega Centauri with the Chandra
X-ray Observatory's ACIS-I detector. The limiting unabsorbed flux in the core is $f_x$ (0.5$-$6.0
keV) $\simeq$ 3 $\times$ 10$^{-16}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ ($L_X$ $\simeq$ 1 $\times$ 10$^{30}$
erg s$^{-1}$ at 5.2 kpc). We estimate that ~$60\pm 20$ of these are cluster members, of which ~30 lie
within the core ($r_c$ $=$ 155 arcsec), and another ~30 between 1$-$2 core radii. We identify four
new optical counterparts, for a total of 45 likely identifications. Probable cluster members include
18 cataclysmic variables (CVs) and CV candidates, one quiescent low-mass X-ray binary, four variable
stars, and five stars that are either associated with w Cen's anomalous red giant branch, or are sub-subgiants.
We estimate that the cluster contains $40\pm 10$ CVs with $L_X$ $>$ 10$^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$, confirming
that CVs are underabundant in w Cen relative to the field. Intrinsic absorption is required to fit
X-ray spectra of six of the nine brightest CVs, suggesting magnetic CVs, or high-inclination systems.
Though no radio millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are currently known in w Cen, more than 30 unidentified
sources have luminosities and X-ray colours like those of MSPs found in other globular clusters;
these could be responsible for the Fermi-detected gamma-ray emission from the cluster. Finally,
we identify a CH star as the counterpart to the second-brightest X-ray source in the cluster and argue
that it is a symbiotic star. This is the first such giant/white dwarf binary to be identified in a globular
cluster.
