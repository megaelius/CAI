The relationships between stellar mass, gas-phase metallicity and star formation rate (i.e. the
Mass-Metallicity, MZR, and the Fundamental Metallcity Relation, FMR) in the local Universe are
revisited by fully anchoring the metallicity determination for SDSS galaxies on the Te abundance
scale defined exploiting the strong-line metallicity calibrations presented in Curti et al. (2017).
Self-consistent metallicity measurements allow a more unbiased assessment of the scaling relations
involving M, Z and SFR, which provide powerful constraints for the chemical evolution models. We
parametrise the MZR with a new functional form which allows us to better characterise the turnover
mass. The slope and saturation metallicity are in good agreement with previous determinations
of the MZR based on the Te method, while showing significantly lower normalisation compared to those
based on photoionisation models. The Z- SFR dependence at fixed stellar mass is also investigated,
being particularly evident for highly star forming galaxies, where the scatter in metallicity
is reduced up to a factor of ~30%. A new parametrisation of the FMR is given by explicitly introducing
the SFR-dependence of the turnover mass into the MZR. The residual scatter in metallicity for the
global galaxy population around the new FMR is 0.054 dex. The new FMR presented in this work represents
a useful local benchmark to compare theoretical predictions and observational studies (of both
local and high-redshift galaxies) whose metallicity measurements are tied to the abundance scale
defined by the Te method, hence allowing to properly assess its evolution with cosmic time.
