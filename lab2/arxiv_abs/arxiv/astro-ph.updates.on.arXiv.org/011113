We present the completed KMOS$^\mathrm{3D}$ survey $-$ an integral field spectroscopic survey
of 739, $\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})>9$, galaxies at $0.6<z<2.7$ using the K-band Multi Object
Spectrograph (KMOS) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). KMOS$^\mathrm{3D}$ provides a population-wide
census of kinematics, star formation, outflows, and nebular gas conditions both on and off the star-forming
galaxy main sequence through the spatially resolved and integrated properties of H$\alpha$, [N
II], and [S II] emission lines. We detect H$\alpha$ emission for 91% of galaxies on the main sequence
of star-formation and 79% overall. The depth of the survey has allowed us to detect galaxies with
star-formation rates below 1 M$_{\odot}$/ yr$^{-1}$, as well as to resolve 81% of detected galaxies
with $\geq3$ resolution elements along the kinematic major axis. The detection fraction of H$\alpha$
is a strong function of both color and offset from the main sequence, with the detected and non-detected
samples exhibiting different SED shapes. Comparison of H$\alpha$ and UV+IR star formation rates
(SFRs) reveal that dust attenuation corrections may be underestimated by 0.5 dex at the highest
masses ($\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})>10.5$). We confirm our first year results of a high rotation
dominated fraction (monotonic velocity gradient and $v_\mathrm{rot}$/$\sigma_0 > \sqrt{3.36}$)
of 77% for the full KMOS$^\mathrm{3D}$ H$\alpha$sample. The rotation-dominated fraction is a
function of both stellar mass and redshift with the strongest evolution measured over the redshift
range of the survey for galaxies with $\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})<10.5$. With this paper we include
a final data release of all 739 observed objects.
