Up until recently, our knowledge of high redshift star formation and how these early stars ionized
the Universe has been limited to theory and simulations. Now, however, observations of the Epoch
of Reionization are becoming a possibility. In particular, we examine two of these observables
- the excess light in the Near Infrared Background that may be due to high redshift stars, star forming
regions, and ionized HII bubbles, and the 21cm emission from neutral hydrogen in the very early Universe.
Because these two forms of emission should result from different, mutually exclusive regions,
there should be some level of anti-correlation between them. We discuss the strengths of using cross-correlations
between these observations to learn more about high redshift star formation and reionization history.
In particular, we create simulated maps of emission from both the Near Infrared Background and 21cm
emission. We find that these observations are anti-correlated, with the strongest anti-correlation
originating from times when the Universe is half ionized. This result is robust and does not depend
on the properties of the stars themselves. Rather, it depends on the ionization history, with the
strongest anti-correlation occurring at the frequency for the 21cm observation that corresponds
to the redshift where the Universe was half ionized. Cross-correlations can provide redshift information,
which the Near Infrared Background can not provide alone. In addition, cross-correlations can
help separate foreground emission from the true high redshift component, making it possible to
say with greater certainty that we are indeed witnessing the Epoch of Reionization.
