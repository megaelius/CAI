We present a joint analysis of the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) final data releases. A key novelty of our study is the use of a new full-shape
(FS) likelihood for the redshift-space galaxy power spectrum of the BOSS data, based on an improved
perturbation theory template. We show that the addition of the redshift space galaxy clustering
measurements breaks degeneracies present in the CMB data alone and tightens constraints on cosmological
parameters. Assuming the minimal $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with massive neutrinos, we find the following
late-Universe parameters: the Hubble constant \mbox{$H_0=67.95^{+0.66}_{-0.52}$ km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$},
the matter density fraction \mbox{$\Omega_m=0.3079^{+0.0065}_{-0.0085}\,$}, the mass fluctuation
amplitude \mbox{$\sigma_8=0.8087_{-0.0072}^{+0.012}\,$}, and an upper limit on the sum of neutrino
masses \mbox{$M_{\text{tot}} <0.16\,$ eV} ($95\%$ CL).This can be contrasted with the Planck-only
measurements: \mbox{$H_0=67.14_{-0.72}^{+1.3}$} km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$, $\Omega_m=0.3188^{+0.0091}_{-0.016}\,$,
\mbox{$\sigma_8=0.8053_{-0.0091}^{+0.019}\,$}, and \mbox{$M_{\text{tot}} <0.26\,$ eV}
($95\%$ CL). Our bound on the sum of neutrino masses relaxes once the hierarchy-dependent priors
from the oscillation experiments are imposed. The addition of the new FS likelihood also constrains
the effective number of extra relativistic degrees of freedom, \mbox{$N_{\text{eff}}=2.88\pm
0.17$}. Our study shows that the current FS and the pure baryon acoustic oscillation data add a similar
amount of information in combination with the Planck likelihood. We argue that this is just a coincidence
given the BOSS volume and efficiency of the current reconstruction algorithms.In the era of future
surveys FS will play a dominant role in cosmological parameter measurements.
