Pulsation frequencies reveal the interior structures of white dwarf stars, shedding light on the
properties of these compact objects that represent the final evolutionary stage of most stars.
Two-minute cadence photometry from TESS will record pulsation signatures from bright white dwarfs
over the entire sky. We aim to demonstrate the sensitivity of TESS data to measuring pulsations of
helium-atmosphere white dwarfs in the DBV instability strip, and what asteroseismic analysis
of these measurements can constrain about their stellar structures. We present a case study of the
pulsating DBV WD 0158$-$160 that was observed as TIC 257459955 with the 2-minute cadence for 20.3
days in TESS Sector 3. We measure the frequencies of variability of TIC 257459955 with an iterative
periodogram and prewhitening procedure. The measured frequencies are compared to calculations
from two sets of white dwarf models to constrain the stellar parameters: the fully evolutionary
models from LPCODE, and the structural models from WDEC. We detect and measure the frequencies of
nine pulsation modes and eleven combination frequencies of WD 0158$-$160 to $\sim0.01 \mu$Hz precision.
Most, if not all, of the observed pulsations belong to an incomplete sequence of dipole ($\ell=1$)
modes with a mean period spacing of $38.1\pm1.0$ s. The global best-fit seismic models from both
codes have effective temperatures that are $\gtrsim3000$ K hotter than archival spectroscopic
values of $24{,}100-25{,}500$ K; however, cooler secondary solutions are found that are consistent
with both the spectroscopic effective temperature and distance constraints from Gaia astrometry.
