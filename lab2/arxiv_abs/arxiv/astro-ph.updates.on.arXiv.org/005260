For a sample of star forming galaxies in the redshift interval 0.15$<$z$<$0.3, we study how both
the relative strength of the AGN infra-red emission, compared to that due to the star formation (SF),
and the numerical fraction of AGNs, change as a function of the total stellar mass of the hosting galaxy
group (M$^{*}_{\mathrm{group}}$), between $10^{10.25}$ and $10^{11.9}$M$_{\odot}$. Using
a multi-component SED fitting analysis, we separate the contribution of stars, AGN torus and star
formation to the total emission at different wavelengths. This technique is applied to a new multi-wavelength
data-set in the SIMES field (23 not redundant photometric bands), spanning the wavelength range
from the UV (GALEX) to the far-IR (Herschel) and including crucial AKARI and WISE mid-IR observations
(4.5 \mu m$<\lambda<$24 \mu m), where the BH thermal emission is stronger. This new photometric
catalog, that includes our best photo-z estimates, is released through the NASA/IPAC Infrared
Science Archive (IRSA). Groups are identified through a friends of friends algorithm ($\sim$62%
purity, $\sim$51% completeness). We identified a total of 45 galaxies requiring an AGN emission
component, 35 of which in groups and 10 in the field. We find BHAR$\propto ($M$^{*}_{\mathrm{group}})^{1.21\pm0.27}$
and (BHAR/SFR)$\propto ($M$^{*}_{\mathrm{group}})^{1.04\pm0.24}$ while, in the same range
of M$^{*}_{\mathrm{group}}$, we do not observe any sensible change in the numerical fraction of
AGNs. Our results indicate that the nuclear activity (i.e. the BHAR and the BHAR/SFR ratio) is enhanced
when galaxies are located in more massive and richer groups.
