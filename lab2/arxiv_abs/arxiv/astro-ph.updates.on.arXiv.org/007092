The multi-wavelength non-thermal emission from the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817
has raised a heated debate concerning the post-merger outflow structure. Both a relativistic structured
jet viewed off-axis and a mildly relativistic quasi-spherical outflow can explain the observational
data of GW170817 up to ~260 days. We utilize a physically motivated analytic two-parameter model
called the "boosted fireball" for the outflow structure after it has expanded far from the merger
site and has entered the self-similar coasting phase. This model consists of a family of outflows
with a structure varying smoothly between a highly collimated ultra-relativistic jet and an isotropic
fireball. We simulate the dynamical evolution, starting with "boosted fireball" initial conditions,
of 240 outflows using the moving-mesh relativistic hydrodynamics code JET to follow their evolution
through the afterglow phase. We compute nearly 2,000,000 synchrotron spectra from the hydrodynamic
simulations using the standard synchrotron radiation model. By making use of scaling relations
in the hydrodynamic and radiation equations, we develop a synthetic light curve generator with
an efficient sampling speed. This allows us to fit the observational data by performing Markov-Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis in a 8-dimensional parameter space, consisting of hydrodynamic parameters,
radiation parameters and observational parameters. Our results favor the relativistic structured
jet, with a jet opening angle ~5 deg and Lorentz factor ~175, viewed from an off-axis angle of 27(+9-3)
deg. Due to parameter degeneracies, we find broad distributions for the explosion energy E_0, the
circumburst density n_0, epsilon_e and epsilon_B. The combination of a high n_0 and a low epsilon_B
can also produce a good fit, indicating that an extremely low n_0 may not be required for GW170817.
