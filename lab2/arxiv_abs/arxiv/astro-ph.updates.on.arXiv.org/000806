The Galactic center is the most active site of star formation in the Milky Way Galaxy, where particularly
high-mass stars have formed very recently and are still forming today. However, since we are looking
at the Galactic center through the Galactic disk, knowledge of extinction is crucial when studying
this region. The Arches cluster is a young, massive starburst cluster near the Galactic center.
We observed the Arches cluster out to its tidal radius using Ks-band imaging obtained with NAOS/CONICA
at the VLT combined with Subaro/Cisco J-band data to gain a full understanding of the cluster mass
distribution. We show that the determination of the mass of the most massive star in the Arches cluster,
which had been used in previous studies to establish an upper mass limit for the star formation process
in the Milky Way, strongly depends on the assumed slope of the extinction law. Assuming the two regimes
of widely used infrared extinction laws, we show that the difference can reach up to 30% for individually
derived stellar masses and Delta AKs ~ 1 magnitude in acquired Ks-band extinction, while the present-day
mass function slope changes by ~ 0.17 dex. The present-day mass function slope derived assuming
the more recent extinction law increases from a flat slope of alpha_{Nishi}=-1.50 \pm0.35 in the
core (r<0.2 pc) to alpha_{Nishi}=-2.21 \pm0.27 in the intermediate annulus (0.2 <r<0.4
pc), where the Salpeter slope is -2.3. The mass function steepens to alpha_{Nishi}=-3.21 \pm0.30
in the outer annulus (0.4<r<1.5 pc), indicating that the outer cluster region is depleted
of high-mass stars. This picture is consistent with mass segregation owing to the dynamical evolution
of the cluster.
