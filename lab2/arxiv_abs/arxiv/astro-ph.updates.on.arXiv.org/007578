Understanding the distribution and occurrence rate of small planets was a fundamental goal of the
Kepler transiting exoplanet mission, and could be improved with K2 and TESS. Deriving accurate
exoplanetary radii requires accurate measurements of the host star radii and the planetary transit
depths, including accounting for any "third light" in the system due to nearby bound companions
or background stars. High-resolution imaging of Kepler and K2 planet candidate hosts to detect
very close (within ~0.5") background or bound stellar companions has been crucial for both confirming
the planetary nature of candidates, and the determination of accurate planetary radii and mean
densities. Here we present an investigation of the effect of close companions, both detected and
undetected, on the observed (raw count) exoplanet radius distribution. We demonstrate that the
recently detected "gap" in the observed radius distribution (also seen in the completeness-corrected
distribution) is fairly robust to undetected stellar companions, given that all of the systems
in the sample have undergone some kind of vetting with high-resolution imaging. However, while
the gap in the observed sample is not erased or shifted, it is partially filled in after accounting
for possible undetected stellar companions. These findings have implications for the most likely
core composition, and thus formation location, of super-Earth and sub-Neptune planets. Furthermore,
we show that without high-resolution imaging of planet candidate host stars, the shape of the observed
exoplanet radius distribution will be incorrectly inferred, for both Kepler- and TESS-detected
systems.
