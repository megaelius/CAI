We analysed the richness--mass scaling of 23 very massive clusters at $0.15<z<0.55$ with
homogenously measured weak-lensing masses and richnesses within a fixed aperture of $0.5$ Mpc
radius. We found that the richness--mass scaling is very tight (the scatter is $<0.09$ dex with
90 \% probability) and independent of cluster evolutionary status and morphology. This implies
a close association between infall and evolution of dark matter and galaxies in the central region
of clusters. We also found that the evolution of the richness-mass intercept is minor at most, and,
given the minor mass evolution across the studied redshift range, the richness evolution of individual
massive clusters also turns out to be very small. Finally, it was paramount to account for the cluster
mass function and the selection function. Ignoring them would led to biases larger than the (otherwise
quoted) errors. Our study benefits from: a) weak-lensing masses instead of proxy-based masses
thereby removing the ambiguity between a real trend and one induced by an accounted evolution of
the used mass proxy; b) the use of projected masses that simplify the statistical analysis thereby
not requiring consideration of the unknown covariance induced by the cluster orientation/triaxiality;
c) the use of aperture masses as they are free of the pseudo-evolution of mass definitions anchored
to the evolving density of the Universe; d) a proper accounting of the sample selection function
and of the Malmquist-like effect induced by the cluster mass function; e) cosmological simulations
for the computation of the cluster mass function, its evolution, and the mass growth of each individual
cluster.
