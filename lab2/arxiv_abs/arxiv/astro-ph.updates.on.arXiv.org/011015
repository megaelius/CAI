We carried out mapping observations toward three nearby molecular clouds, Orion A, Aquila Rift,
and M17, using a new 100 GHz receiver, FOREST, on the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. In the present paper,
we describe the details of the data obtained such as intensity calibration, data sensitivity, angular
resolution, and velocity resolution. Each target contains at least one high-mass star-forming
region. The target molecular lines were $^{12}$CO ($J = 1 - 0$), $^{13}$CO ($J = 1 - 0$), C$^{18}$O
($J = 1 - 0$), N$_2$H$^+$ ($J=1-0$), and CCS ($J_N=8_7-7_6$), with which we covered the density range
of 10$^2$ cm$^{-3}$ to 10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$ with an angular resolution of $\sim 20\arcsec$ and a velocity
resolution of $\sim$ 0.1 km s$^{-1}$. Assuming the representative distances of 414 pc, 436 pc, and
2.1 kpc, the maps of Orion A, Aquila Rift, and M17 cover most of the densest parts with areas of about
7 pc $\times$ 15 pc, 7 pc $\times$ 7 pc, and 36 pc $\times$ 18 pc, respectively. On the basis of the $^{13}$CO
column density distribution, the total molecular masses are derived to be $3.86 \times 10^4 M_\odot$,
$2.67 \times 10^4 M_\odot$, and $8.1\times 10^5 M_\odot$ for Orion A, Aquila Rift, and M17, respectively.
For all the clouds, the H$_2$ column density exceeds the theoretical threshold for high-mass star
formation of $\gtrsim$ 1 g cm$^{-2}$, only toward the regions which contain current high-mass star-forming
sites. For other areas, further mass accretion or dynamical compression would be necessary for
future high-mass star formation. This is consistent with the current star formation activity.
Using the $^{12}$CO data, we demonstrate that our data have enough capability to identify molecular
outflows, and for Aquila Rift, we identify 4 new outflow candidates. The scientific results will
be discussed in details in separate papers.
