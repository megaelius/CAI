While a fully-coherent all-sky search is known to be optimal for detecting gravitational wave signals
from compact binary coalescences, its high computational cost has limited current searches to
less sensitive coincidence-based schemes. Following up on previous work that has demonstrated
the effectiveness of Particle Swarm Optimization in reducing the computational cost of this search,
we present an implementation that achieves near real-time computational speed. This is achieved
by combining the search efficiency of PSO with a significantly revised and optimized numerical
implementation of the underlying mathematical formalism along with additional multi-threaded
parallelization layers in a distributed computing framework. For a network of four second-generation
detectors with $60$~min data from each, the runtime of the implementation presented here ranges
between $\approx 1.4$ to $\approx 0.5$ times the data duration for network signal-to-noise ratios
(SNRs) of $\gtrsim 10$ and $\gtrsim 12$, respectively. The reduced runtimes are obtained with small
to negligible losses in detection sensitivity: for a false alarm rate of $\simeq 1$~event per year
in Gaussian stationary noise, the loss in detection probability is $\leq 5\%$ and $\leq 2\%$ for
SNRs of $10$ and $12$, respectively. Using the fast implementation, we are able to quantify frequentist
errors in parameter estimation for signals in the double neutron star mass range using a large number
of simulated data realizations. A clear dependence of parameter estimation errors and detection
sensitivity on the condition number of the network antenna pattern matrix is revealed. Combined
with previous work, this paper securely establishes the effectiveness of PSO-based fully-coherent
all-sky search across the entire binary inspiral mass range that is relevant to ground-based detectors.
