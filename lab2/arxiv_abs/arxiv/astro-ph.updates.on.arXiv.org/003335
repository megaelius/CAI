Nearby dwarf galaxies provide a unique laboratory in which to test stellar population models below
$Z_\odot/2$. Such tests are particularly important for interpreting the surprising high-ionization
UV line emission detected at $z>6$ in recent years. We present HST/COS ultraviolet spectra of ten
nearby metal-poor star-forming galaxies selected to show He II emission in SDSS optical spectra.
The targets span nearly a dex in gas-phase oxygen abundance ($7.8<12+\log\mathrm{O/H}<8.5$)
and present uniformly large specific star formation rates (sSFR $\sim 10^2$ $\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}$).
The UV spectra confirm that metal-poor stellar populations can power extreme nebular emission
in high-ionization UV lines, reaching C III] equivalent widths comparable to those seen in systems
at $z\sim 6-7$. Our data reveal a marked transition in UV spectral properties with decreasing metallicity,
with systems below $12+\log\mathrm{O/H}\lesssim 8.0$ ($Z/Z_\odot \lesssim 1/5$) presenting
minimal stellar wind features and prominent nebular emission in He II and C IV. This is consistent
with nearly an order of magnitude increase in ionizing photon production beyond the $\mathrm{He^+}$-ionizing
edge relative to H-ionizing flux as metallicity decreases below a fifth solar, well in excess of
standard stellar population synthesis predictions. Our results suggest that often neglected
sources of energetic radiation such as stripped binary products and very massive O-stars produce
a sharper change in the ionizing spectrum with decreasing metallicity than expected. Consequently,
nebular emission in C IV and He II powered by these stars may provide useful metallicity constraints
in the reionization era.
