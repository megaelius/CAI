The cosmological 21cm signal is a physics-rich probe of the early Universe, encoding information
about both the ionization and the thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM). The latter
is likely governed by X-rays from star-formation processes inside very high redshift (z = 15) galaxies.
The X-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these galaxies are entirely unknown. However,
due to the strong dependence of the mean free path on the photon energy, the X-ray SED can have a significant
impact on upcoming interferometric observations from both the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization.
Recent Chandra observations of nearby, star-forming galaxies show that their SEDs are more complicated
than is usually assumed in 21cm studies. In particular, these galaxies have ubiquitous, sub-keV
thermal emission from the hot interstellar medium (ISM), which generally dominates the soft X-ray
luminosity (with energies below 1 keV, sufficiently low to significantly interact with the IGM).
Using illustrative soft and hard SEDs, we show that the IGM temperature fluctuations in the early
Universe would be substantially increased if the X-ray spectra of the first galaxies were dominated
by the hot ISM, compared with X-ray binaries with harder spectra. The associated large-scale power
of the 21cm signal would be higher by approximately a factor of three. More generally, we show that
the peak in the redshift evolution of the large-scale (k = 0.2 Mpc^{-1}) 21cm power is a robust probe
of the soft-band SED of the first galaxies, and importantly, is not degenerate with their bolometric
luminosities. On the other hand, the redshift of the peak constrains the X-ray luminosity and halo
masses which host the first galaxies. Hence, upcoming 21cm interferometry is a powerful tool for
studying the first galaxies and their high-energy processes.
