Radial mass-to-light ratio gradients cause the half-mass and half-light radii of galaxies to differ,
potentially biasing studies that use half-light radii. Here we present the largest catalog to date
of galaxy half-mass radii at z > 1: 7,006 galaxies in the CANDELS fields at 1.0 < z < 2.5. The sample includes
both star-forming and quiescent galaxies with stellar masses 9.0 < log(M_* / M_\odot) < 11.5. We
test three methods for calculating half-mass radii from multi-band PSF-matched HST imaging: two
based on spatially-resolved SED modeling, and one that uses a rest-frame color profile. All three
methods agree, with scatter <~0.3 dex. In agreement with previous studies, most galaxies in our
sample have negative color gradients (the centers are redder than the outskirts, and r_e,mass <
r_e,light). We find that color gradient strength has significant trends with increasing stellar
mass, half-light radius, U-V color, and stellar mass surface density. These trends have not been
seen before at z>1. Furthermore, color gradients of star-forming and quiescent galaxies show a
similar redshift evolution: they are flat at z>~2, then steeply decrease as redshift decreases.
This affects the galaxy mass-size relation. The normalizations of the star-forming and quiescent
r_mass-M_* relations are 10-40% smaller than the corresponding r_light-M_* relations; the slopes
are ~0.1-0.3 dex shallower. Finally, the half-mass radii of star-forming and quiescent galaxies
at M_* = 10^{10.5}M_\odot only grow by ~1%$ and ~8% between z~2.25 and z~1.25. This is significantly
less than the ~37% and ~47% size increases found when using the half-light radius.
