Transitional disks are circumstellar disks with inner holes that in some cases are produced by planets
and/or substellar companions in these systems. For this reason, these disks are extremely important
for the study of planetary system formation. The Herschel Space Observatory provides an unique
opportunity for studying the outer regions of protoplanetary disks. In this work we update previous
knowledge on the transitional disks in the Chamaeleon I and II regions with data from the Herschel
Gould Belt Survey. We propose a new method for transitional disk classification based on the WISE
12 micron-PACS 70 micron color, together with inspection of the Herschel images. We applied this
method to the population of Class II sources in the Chamaeleon region and studied the spectral energy
distributions of the transitional disks in the sample. We also built the median spectral energy
distribution of Class II objects in these regions for comparison with transitional disks. The proposed
method allows a clear separation of the known transitional disks from the Class II sources. We find
6 transitional disks, all previously known, and identify 5 objects previously thought to be transitional
as possibly non-transitional. We find higher fluxes at the PACS wavelengths in the sample of transitional
disks than those of Class II objects. We show the Herschel 70 micron band to be an efficient tool for
transitional disk identification. The sensitivity and spatial resolution of Herschel reveals
a significant contamination level among the previously identified transitional disk candidates
for the two regions, which calls for a revision of previous samples of transitional disks in other
regions. The systematic excess found at the PACS bands could be a result of the mechanism that produces
the transitional phase, or an indication of different evolutionary paths for transitional disks
and Class II sources.
