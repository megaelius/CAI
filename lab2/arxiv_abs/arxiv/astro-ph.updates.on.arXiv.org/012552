We present light curves and spectra of the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-18pg / AT 2018dyb
spanning a period of one year. The event shows a plethora of strong emission lines, including the
Balmer series, He II, He I and metal lines of O III $\lambda$3760 and N III $\lambda\lambda$ 4100,
4640 (blended with He II). The latter lines are consistent with originating from the Bowen fluorescence
mechanism. By analyzing literature spectra of past events, we conclude that these lines are common
in TDEs. The spectral diversity of optical TDEs is thus larger than previously thought and includes
N-rich events besides H- and He-rich events. We study how the spectral lines evolve with time, by
means of their width, relative strength, and velocity offsets. The velocity width of the lines starts
at $\sim$ 13000 km s$^{-1}$ and decreases with time. The ratio of He II to N III increases with time.
The same is true for ASASSN-14li, which has a very similar spectrum to AT 2018dyb but its lines are
narrower by a factor of $>$2. We estimate a black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH}$ = $3.3^{+5.0}_{-2.0}\times
10^6$ $M_{\odot}$ by using the $M$-$\sigma$ relation. This is consistent with the black hole mass
derived using the MOSFiT transient fitting code. The detection of strong Bowen lines in the optical
spectrum is an indirect proof for extreme ultraviolet and (reprocessed) X-ray radiation and favors
an accretion origin for the TDE optical luminosity. A model where photons escape after multiple
scatterings through a super-Eddington thick disk and its optically thick wind, viewed at an angle
close to the disk plane, is consistent with the observations.
