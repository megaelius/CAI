We have modified the graphical user interfaced close binary system analysis program CurveFit to
the form WinKepler and applied it to 16 representative planetary candidate light curves found in
the NASA Exoplanet Archive (NEA) at the Caltech website this http URL , with an aim to compare different
analytical approaches. WinKepler has parameter options for a realistic physical model, including
gravity-brightening and structural parameters derived from the relevant Radau equation. We tested
our best-fitting parameter-sets for formal determinacy and adequacy. A primary aim is to compare
our parameters with those listed in the NEA. Although there are trends of agreement, small differences
in the main parameter values are found in some cases, and there may be some relative bias towards a
90 degrees value for the NEA inclinations. These are assessed against realistic error estimates.
Photometric variability from causes other than planetary transits affects at least 6 of the data-sets
studied; with small pulsational behaviour found in 3 of those. For the false positive KOI 4.01, we
found that the eclipses could be modelled by a faint background classical Algol as effectively as
by a transiting exoplanet. Our empirical checks of limb-darkening, in the cases of KOI 1.01 and 12.01,
revealed that the assigned stellar temperatures are probably incorrect. For KOI 13.01, our empirical
mass-ratio differs by about 7% from that of Mislis and Hodgkin (2012), who neglected structural
effects and higher order terms in the tidal distortion. Such detailed parameter evaluation, additional
to the usual main geometric ones, provides an additional objective for this work.
