CYRA (CrYogenic solar spectrogRAph) is a facility instrument of the 1.6-meter Goode Solar Telescope
(GST) at the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). CYRA focuses on the study of the near-infrared solar
spectrum between 1 and 5 microns, a under explored region which is not only a fertile ground for photospheric
magnetic diagnostics, but also allows a unique window into the chromosphere lying atop the photosphere.
CYRA is the first ever fully cryogenic spectrograph in any solar observatory with its two predecessors,
on the McMath-Pierce and Mees Telescopes, being based on warm optics except for the detectors and
order sorting filters. CYRA is used to probe magnetic fields in various solar features and the quiet
photosphere. CYRA measurements will allow new and better 3D extrapolations of the solar magnetic
field and will provide more accurate boundary conditions for solar activity models. Superior spectral
resolution of 150,000 and better allows enhanced observations of the chromosphere in the carbon
monoxide (CO) spectral bands and will yield a better understanding of energy transport in the solar
atmosphere. CYRA is divided into two optical sub-systems: The Fore-Optics Module and the Spectrograph.
The Spectrograph is the heart of the instrument and contains the IR detector, grating, slits, filters,
and imaging optics all in a cryogenically cooled Dewar (cryostat). The detector a 2048 by 2048 pixel
HAWAII 2 array produced by Teledyne Scientific & Imaging, LLC. The interior of the cryostat and the
readout electronics are maintained at 90 Kelvin by helium refrigerant based cryo-coolers, while
the IR array is cooled to 30 Kelvin. The Fore-Optics Module de-rotates and stabilizes the solar image,
provides scanning capabilities, and transfers the GST image to the Spectrograph. CYRA has been
installed and is undergoing its commissioning phase.
