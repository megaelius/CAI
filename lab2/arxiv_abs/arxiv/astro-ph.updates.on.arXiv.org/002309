We explore the non-linear, high-frequency, aperiodic variability properties in the three cataclysmic
variables MV Lyr, KIC 8751494 and V1504 Cyg observed with Kepler, as well as the X-ray binary Cyg X-1
observed with RXTE. This is done through the use of a high-order Fourier statistic called the bispectrum
and its related biphase and bicoherence, as well as the time-skewness statistic. We show how all
objects display qualitatively similar biphase trends. In particular all biphase amplitudes are
found to be smaller than $\pi/2$, suggesting that the flux distributions for all sources are positively
skewed on all observed timescales, consistent with the log-normal distributions expected from
the fluctuating accretion disk model. We also find that for all objects the biphases are positive
at frequencies where the corresponding power spectral densities display their high frequency
break. This suggests that the noise-like flaring observed is rising more slowly than it is falling,
and thus not time-reversible. This observation is also consistent with the fluctuating accretion
disk model. Furthermore, we observe the same qualitative biphase trends in all four objects, where
the biphases display a distinct decrease at frequencies below the high-frequency break in their
respective power spectral densities. This behaviour can also be observed in the time-skewness
of all four objects. As far as we are aware, there is no immediate explanation for the observed biphase
decreases. The biphase decreases may thus suggest that the fluctuating accretion disk model begins
to break down at frequencies below the high frequency break.
