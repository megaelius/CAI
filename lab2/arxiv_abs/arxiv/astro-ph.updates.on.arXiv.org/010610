We present the B-fields mapped in IRDC G34.43+0.24 using 850\,$\mu$m polarized dust emission observed
with the POL-2 instrument at JCMT. We examine the magnetic field geometries and strengths in the
northern, central, and southern regions of the filament. The overall field geometry is ordered
and aligned closely perpendicular to the filament's main axis, particularly in regions containing
the central clumps MM1 and MM2, whereas MM3 in the north has field orientations aligned with its major
axis. The overall field orientations are uniform at large (POL-2 at 14$\arcsec$ and SHARP at 10$\arcsec$)
to small scales (TADPOL at 2.5$\arcsec$ and SMA at 1.5$\arcsec$) in the MM1 and MM2 regions. SHARP/CSO
observations in MM3 at 350\,$\mu$m from Tang et al. show a similar trend as seen in our POL-2 observations.
TADPOL observations demonstrate a well-defined field geometry in MM1/MM2 consistent with MHD
simulations of accreting filaments. We obtained a plane-of-sky magnetic field strength of 470$\pm$190\,$\mu$G,
100$\pm$40\,$\mu$G, and 60$\pm$34\,$\mu$G in the central, northern and southern regions of G34,
respectively, using the updated Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi relation. The estimated value of
field strength, combined with column density and velocity dispersion values available in the literature,
suggests G34 to be marginally critical with criticality parameter $\rm \lambda$ values 0.8$\pm$0.4,
1.1$\pm$0.8, and 0.9$\pm$0.5 in the central, northern, and southern regions, respectively. The
turbulent motions in G34 are sub-Alfv\'{e}nic with Alfv\'{e}nic Mach numbers of 0.34$\pm$0.13,
0.53$\pm$0.30, and 0.49$\pm$0.26 in the three regions. The observed aligned B-fields in G34.43+0.24
are consistent with theoretical models suggesting that B-fields play an important role in guiding
the contraction of the cloud driven by gravity.
