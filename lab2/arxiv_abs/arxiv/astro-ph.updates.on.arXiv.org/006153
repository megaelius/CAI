A High-performance Atmospheric Radiation Package (HARP) is developed for studying multiple-scattering
planetary atmospheres. HARP is an open-source program written in C++ that utilizes high-level
data structure and parallel-computing algorithms. It is generic in three aspects. First, the construction
of the model atmospheric profile is generic. The program can either take in an atmospheric profile
or construct an adiabatic thermal and compositional profile, taking into account the clouds and
latent heat release due to condensation. Second, the calculation of opacity is generic, based on
line-by-line molecular transitions and tabulated continuum data, along with a table of correlated-k
opacity provided as an option to speed up the calculation of energy fluxes. Third, the selection
of the solver for the radiative transfer equation is generic. The solver is not hardwired in the program.
Instead, based on the purpose, a variety of radiative transfer solvers can be chosen to couple with
the atmosphere model and the opacity model. We use the program to investigate the radiative heating
and cooling rates of all four giant planets in the Solar System. Our Jupiter's result is consistent
with previous publications. Saturn has a nearly perfect balance between the heating rate and cooling
rate. Uranus has the least radiative fluxes because of the lack of CH4 and its photochemical products.
Both Uranus and Neptune suffer from a severe energy deficit in their stratospheres. Possible ways
to resolve this issue are discussed. Finally, we recalculate the radiative time constants of all
four giant planet atmospheres and find that the traditional values from (Conrath BJ, Gierasch PJ,
Leroy SS. Temperature and Circulation in the Stratosphere of the Outer Planets. Icar. 1990;83:255-81)
are significantly overestimated.
