Photoionization fronts play a dominant role in many astrophysical situations, but remain difficult
to achieve in a laboratory experiment. We present the results from a computational parameter study
evaluating the feasibility of the photoionization experiment presented in the design paper by
Drake, R. P., Hazak, G., Keiter, P. A., Davis, J. S., Patterson, C. R., Frank, A., Blackman, E. G.,
& Busquet, M. 2016, ApJ, 833, 249 in which a photoionization front is generated in a nitrogen medium
. The nitrogen gas density and the Planckian radiation temperature of the x-ray source define each
simulation. Simulations modeled experiments in which the x-ray flux is generated by a laser-heated
gold foil, suitable for experiments using many kJ of laser energy, and experiments in which the flux
is generated by a "z-pinch" device, which implodes a cylindrical shell of conducting wires. The
models are run using CRASH, our block-adaptive-mesh code for multi-material radiation hydrodynamics.
The radiative transfer model uses multi-group, flux-limited diffusion with thirty radiation
groups. In addition, electron heat conduction is modeled using a single-group, flux-limited diffusion.
In the theory, a photoionization front can exist only when the ratios of the electron recombination
rate to the photoionization rate and the electron impact ionization rate to the recombination rate
lie in certain ranges. These ratios are computed for several ionization states of nitrogen. Photoionization
fronts are found to exist for laser driven models with moderate nitrogen densities ($\sim$10$^{21}$
cm$^{-3}$) and radiation temperatures above 90 eV. For "z-pinch" driven models, lower nitrogen
densities are preferred ($<$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$). We conclude that the proposed experiments
are likely to generate photoionization fronts.
