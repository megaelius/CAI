We present updated cosmological constraints for the KiDS+VIKING-450 cosmic shear dataset (KV450),
estimated using redshift distributions and photometric samples defined using self organising
maps (SOMs). Our fiducial analysis finds marginal posterior constraints of $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm
m}/0.3}=0.716^{+0.043}_{-0.038}$; smaller than, but fully consistent with, previous work using
this dataset ($|\Delta S_8| = 0.023$). We analyse additional samples and redshift distributions
constructed in three ways: excluding certain spectroscopic surveys during redshift calibration,
excluding lower-confidence spectroscopic redshifts in redshift calibration, and considering
only photometric sources which are jointly calibrated by at least three spectroscopic surveys.
In all cases, the method utilised here proves robust: we find a maximal deviation from our fiducial
analysis of $|\Delta S_8| \leq 0.009$ for all samples defined and analysed using our SOM. Our largest
shift in $S_8$ is found when calibrating redshift distributions without the DEEP2 spectroscopic
subset, where we find $S_8=0.707_{-0.042}^{+0.046}$. This difference with respect to the fiducial
is both significantly smaller than, and in the opposite direction to, the equivalent shift from
previous work. No sample analysed in this work results in a meaningful positive shift in $S_8$ with
respect to our fiducial constraints. These results suggest that our improved cosmological parameter
estimates are insensitive to pathological misrepresentation of photometric sources by the spectroscopy
used for direct redshift calibration, and therefore that this systematic effect cannot be responsible
for the observed difference between $S_8$ estimates made with KV450 and Planck CMB probes.
