Context. The number of identified complex organic molecules (COMs) in inter- and circumstellar
gas-phase environments is steadily increasing. Recent laboratory studies show that many such
species form on icy dust grains. At present only smaller molecular species have been directly identified
in space in the solid state. Accurate spectroscopic laboratory data of frozen COMs, embedded in
ice matrices containing ingredients related to their formation scheme, are still largely lacking.
Aims. This work provides infrared reference spectra of acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO), ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH),
and dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$) recorded in a variety of ice environments and for astronomically
relevant temperatures, as needed to guide or interpret astronomical observations, specifically
for upcoming James Webb Space Telescope observations. Methods. Fourier transform transmission
spectroscopy (500-4000 cm$^{-1}$ / 20-2.5 $\mu$m, 1.0 cm$^{-1}$ resolution) was used to investigate
solid acetaldehyde, ethanol and dimethyl ether, pure or mixed with water, CO, methanol, or CO:methanol.
These species were deposited on a cryogenically cooled infrared transmissive window at 15~K. A
heating ramp was applied, during which IR spectra were recorded until all ice constituents were
thermally desorbed. Results. We present a large number of reference spectra that can be compared
with astronomical data. Accurate band positions and band widths are provided for the studied ice
mixtures and temperatures. Special efforts have been put into those bands of each molecule that
are best suited for identification. For acetaldehyde the 7.427 and 5.803 $\mu$m bands are recommended,
for ethanol the 11.36 and 7.240 $\mu$m bands are good candidates, and for dimethyl ether bands at
9.141 and 8.011 $\mu$m can be used. All spectra are publicly available in the Leiden Database for
Ice.
