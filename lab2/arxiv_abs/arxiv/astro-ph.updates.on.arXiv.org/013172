One of the discoveries made by Parker Solar Probe during first encounters with the Sun is the ubiquitous
presence of relatively small-scale structures standing out as sudden deflections of the magnetic
field. They were called switchbacks as some of them show up the full reversal of the radial component
of the magnetic field and then return to regular conditions. Analyzing the magnetic field and plasma
perturbations associated with switchbacks we identify three types of structures with slightly
different characteristics: 1. Alfvenic structures, where the variations of the magnetic field
components take place while the magnitude of the field remains constant; 2. Compressional, the
field magnitude varies together with changes of the components; 3. Structures manifesting full
reversal of the magnetic field (extremal class of Alfvenic structures). Processing of structures
boundaries and plasma bulk velocity perturbations lead to the conclusion that they represent localized
magnetic field tubes with enhanced parallel plasma velocity and ion beta moving together with respect
to surrounding plasma. The magnetic field deflections before and after the switchbacks reveal
the existence of total axial current. The electric currents are concentrated on the relatively
narrow boundary layers on the surface of the tubes and determine the magnetic field perturbations
inside the tube. These currents are closed on the structure surface, and typically have comparable
azimuthal and the axial components. The surface of the structure may also accommodate an electromagnetic
wave, that assists to particles in carrying currents. We suggest that the two types of structures
we analyzed here may represent the local manifestations of the tube deformations corresponding
to a saturated stage of the Firehose instability development.
