Solar type III radio bursts contain a wealth of information about the dynamics of electron beams
in the solar corona and the inner heliosphere; currently unobtainable through other means. However,
the motion of different regions of an electron beam (front, middle and back) have never been systematically
analysed before. We characterise the type III burst frequency-time evolution using the enhanced
resolution of LOFAR in the frequency range 30 to 70 MHz and use this to probe electron beam dynamics.
Methods. The rise, peak and decay times with a 0.2 MHz spectral resolution were defined for a collection
of 31 type III bursts. The frequency evolution is used to ascertain the apparent velocities of the
front, middle and back of the type III sources and the trends are interpreted using theoretical and
numerical treatments. The type III time profile was better approximated by an asymmetric Gaussian
profile, not an exponential as previously used. Rise and decay times increased with decreasing
frequency and showed a strong correlation. Durations were smaller than previously observed. Drift
rates from the rise times were faster than from the decay times, corresponding to inferred mean electron
beam speeds for the front, middle and back of 0.2, 0.17, 0, 15 c, respectively. Faster beam speeds
correlate with smaller type III durations. We also find type III frequency bandwidth decreases
as frequency decreases. The different speeds naturally explain the elongation of an electron beam
in space as it propagates through the heliosphere. The rate of expansion is proportional to the mean
speed of the exciter; faster beams expand faster. Beam speeds are attributed to varying ensembles
of electron energies at the front, middle and back of the beam.
