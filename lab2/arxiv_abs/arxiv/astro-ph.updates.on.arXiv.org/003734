Constraints on models of the late time acceleration of the universe assume the cosmological principle
of homogeneity and isotropy on large scales. However, small scale inhomogeneities can alter observational
and dynamical relations, affecting the inferred cosmological parameters. For precision constraints
on the properties of dark energy, it is important to assess the potential systematic effects arising
from these inhomogeneities. In this study, we use the Type Ia supernova magnitude-redshift relation
to constrain the inhomogeneities as described by the Dyer-Roeder distance relation and the effect
they have on the dark energy equation of state ($w$), together with priors derived from the most recent
results of the measurements of the power spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background and Baryon
Acoustic Oscillations. We find that the parameter describing the inhomogeneities ($\eta$) is
correlated with $w$. The best fit values $w = -0.933 \pm 0.065$ and $\eta = 0.61 \pm 0.37$ are consistent
with homogeneity at $< 2 \sigma$ level. Assuming homogeneity ($\eta =1$), we find $w = -0.961 \pm
0.055$, indicating only a small change in $w$. For a time-dependent dark energy equation of state,
$w_0 = -0.951 \pm 0.112$ and $w_a = 0.059 \pm 0.418$, to be compared with $w_0 = -0.983 \pm 0.127$ and
$w_a = 0.07 \pm 0.432$ in the homogeneous case, which is also a very small change. Current data are
not sufficient to constrain the fraction of dark matter (DM) in compact objects, $f_p$ at the 95$\%$
C.L., however at 68$\%$ C.L. $f_p < 0.73$. Future supernova surveys will improve the constraints
on $\eta$, and $f_p$, by a factor of $\sim$ 10.
