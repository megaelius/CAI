The positions of multiple images in galaxy lenses are related to the galaxy mass distribution. Smooth
elliptical mass profiles were previously shown to be inadequate in reproducing the quad population.
In this paper, we explore the deviations from such smooth elliptical mass distributions. Unlike
most other work, we use a model-free approach based on the relative polar image angles of quads, and
their position in 3D space with respect to the Fundamental Surface of Quads. The FSQ is defined by
quads produced by elliptical lenses. We have generated thousands of quads from synthetic populations
of lenses with substructure consistent with $\Lambda$CDM simulations, and found that such perturbations
are not sufficient to match the observed distribution of quads relative to the FSQ. The result is
unchanged even when subhalo masses are increased by a factor of ten, and the most optimistic lensing
selection bias is applied. We then produce quads from galaxies created using two components, representing
baryons and dark matter. The transition from the mass being dominated by baryons in inner radii to
being dominated by dark matter in outer radii can carry with it asymmetries, which would affect relative
image angles. We run preliminary experiments using lenses with two elliptical mass components
with nonidentical axis ratios and position angles, perturbations from ellipticity in the form
of nonzero Fourier coefficients $a_4$ and $a_6$, and artificially offset ellipse centers as a proxy
for asymmetry at image radii. We show that combination of these effects is a promising way of accounting
for quad population properties. We conclude that the quad population provides a unique and sensitive
tool for constraining detailed mass distribution in the centers of galaxies.
