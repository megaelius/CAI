We give the three-dimensional dynamical autonomous systems for most of the popular scalar field
dark energy models including (phantom) quintessence, (phantom) tachyon, k-essence and general
non-canonical scalar field models and change the dynamical variables from trivial variables $(x,
y, \lambda)$ to observable related variables $(w_{\phi}, \Omega_{\phi}, \lambda)$. We show the
intimate relationships between those scalar fields that the three-dimensional system of k-essence
can reduce to (phantom) tachyon, general non-canonical scalar field can reduce to (phantom) quintessence
and k-essence can also reduce to (phantom) quintessence for some special cases. For the applications
of the three-dimensional dynamical systems, we investigate several special cases and give the
exactly dynamical solutions in detail. Furthermore, we proved that the dark energy density parameter
$\Omega_{\phi}$ would obey the same differential equation not only for all the scalar models in
this paper but also for all the non-coupled dark energy models under the GR frame. We therefore get
the result that, if we want to find a dark energy phenomenological model which possesses a stable
attractor corresponding to current universe with $\Omega_{de}\sim 0.70$ and $\gamma_{de}\sim
0.1$ to solve or at least alleviate the cosmological coincidence problem without fine-tunings,
we must consider the interaction between dark energy and other barotropic fluids. This result is
valid for not only all the non-coupled dark energy models, but also for many modified gravity models
as long as the energy density and the pressure of dark energy (or effective dark energy) satisfies
the continuity equation in Eq.(67). In the end of this paper, we also raise a question about the possibility
of the chaotic behavior in the spatially flat single scalar field FRW cosmological models in the
presence of ordinary matter.
