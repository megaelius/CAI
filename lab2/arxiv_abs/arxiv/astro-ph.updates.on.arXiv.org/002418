We present four ab initio axisymmetric core-collapse supernova simulations for 12, 15, 20, and
25 $M_\odot$ progenitors. All of the simulations yield explosions and have been evolved for at least
1.2 seconds after core bounce and 1 second after material first becomes unbound. Simulations were
computed with our Chimera code employing spectral neutrino transport, special and general relativistic
transport effects, and state-of-the-art neutrino interactions. Continuing the evolution beyond
1 second allows explosions to develop more fully and the processes powering the explosions to become
more clearly evident. We compute explosion energy estimates, including the binding energy of the
stellar envelope outside the shock, of 0.34, 0.88, 0.38, and 0.70 B ($10^{51}$ ergs) and increasing
at 0.03, 0.15, 0.19, and 0.52 B s$^{-1}$, respectively, for the 12, 15, 20, and 25 $M_\odot$ models.
Three models developed pronounced prolate shock morphologies, while the 20 $M_\odot$ model, though
exhibiting lobes and accretion streams like the other models, develops an approximately spherical,
off-center shock as the explosion begins and then becomes moderately prolate $\sim$600 ms after
bounce. This reduces the explosion energy relative to the other models by reducing mass accretion
during the critical explosion power-up phase. We examine the growth of the explosion energy in our
models through detailed analyses of the energy sources and flows. We find that the 12 and 20 $M_\odot$
models have explosion energies comparable to that of the lower range of observed explosion energies
while the 15 and 25 $M_\odot$ models are within the range of observed explosion energies, particularly
considering the rate at which their explosion energies are increasing. The ejected $^{56}$Ni masses
given by our models are all within observational limits as are the proto-neutron star masses and
kick velocities. (Truncated)
