We present first results from a galaxy population study in the highest redshift galaxy clusters
identified in the 2500 deg$^2$ South Pole Telescope Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect (SPT-SZ) survey.
The cluster selection is to first order independent of galaxy properties, making the SPT-SZ sample
particularly well suited for cluster galaxy population studies. We carry out a 4-band imaging campaign
with the {\it Hubble} and {\it Spitzer} Space Telescopes of the five $z\gtrsim 1.4$, S/N$_{SZE}>$5
clusters, that are among the rarest most massive clusters known at this redshift. All five show clear
overdensities of red galaxies whose colors agree with the initial cluster redshift estimates.
The highest redshift cluster in this sample, SPT-CLJ0459-4947 at $z\sim1.72$, is the most distant
$M_{500}>10^{14}~M_{\odot}$ ICM-selected cluster discovered thus far, and is one of only three
known clusters in this mass range at $z\gtrsim 1.7$, regardless of selection. Based on UVJ-like
photometric classification of quiescent and star-forming galaxies, the passive fraction in the
cluster central regions ($r/r_{500}<0.7$) is higher than in the field at the same redshift, with
corresponding environmental quenching efficiencies typically in the range $\sim0.5-0.8$ for
stellar masses $\log(M/M_{\odot})>10.85$. We have explored the impact of emission from star formation
on the selection of this sample, concluding that all five clusters studied here would still have
been detected with S/N$_{SZE}>$5, even if they had the same passive fraction as measured in the field.
Our results thus point towards an efficient suppression of star formation in massive galaxies in
the central regions of the most massive clusters, occurring already earlier than $z\sim1.5$. [Abridged]
