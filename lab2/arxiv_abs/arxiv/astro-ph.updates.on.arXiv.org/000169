We study the alignment signal between the distribution of brightest satellite galaxies (BSGs)
and the major axis of their host groups using SDSS group catalog constructed by Yang et al. (2007).
After correcting for the effect of group ellipticity, a statistically significant (~ 5\sigma)
major-axis alignment is detected and the alignment angle is found to be 43.0 \pm 0.4 degrees. More
massive and richer groups show stronger BSG alignment. The BSG alignment around blue BCGs is slightly
stronger than that around red BCGs. And red BSGs have much stronger major-axis alignment than blue
BSGs. Unlike BSGs, other satellites do not show very significant alignment with group major axis.
We further explore the BSG alignment in semi-analytic model (SAM) constructed by Guo et al. (2011).
We found general good agreement with observations: BSGs in SAM show strong major-axis alignment
which depends on group mass and richness in the same way as observations; and none of other satellites
exhibit prominent alignment. However, discrepancy also exists in that the SAM shows opposite BSG
color dependence, which is most probably induced by the missing of large scale environment ingredient
in SAM. The combination of two popular scenarios can explain the detected BSG alignment. The first
one: satellites merged into the group preferentially along the surrounding filaments, which is
strongly aligned with the major axis of the group. The second one: BSGs enter their host group more
recently than other satellites, then will preserve more information about the assembling history
and so the major-axis alignment. In SAM, we found positive evidence for the second scenario by the
fact that BSGs merged into groups statistically more recently than other satellites. On the other
hand, although is opposite in SAM, the BSG color dependence in observation might indicate the first
scenario as well.
