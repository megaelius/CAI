Paper I described the normal features of the North Equatorial Belt (NEB) in recent years, especially
the large dark formations which are thought to represent waves in the prograde jet on the NEB south
edge (NEBs, 7N), and the NEB expansion events (NEEs) in which the belt broadens to the north at intervals
of 3 to 5 years. Here I describe an exceptional set of apparently coordinated changes which occurred
in 2011-12, after more localised precursors in 2008 and 2010. (1) The large NEBs dark formations
progressively disappeared until none remained. (2) In the sectors of NEBs thus vacated, smaller
dark features all moved with unprecedented super-fast speeds, which were modulated by the few normal
features as long as they lasted, and then accelerated further, reaching 139-151 m/s. (3) Rifts (expanding
systems of convective white clouds) also disappeared from the NEB. (4) The NEB north half progressively
faded (whitened) until there was only a narrow, southerly NEB, narrower and fainter than it had been
for nearly a century. These changes have several profound implications for understanding the dynamics
of the region. First, the NEBs took on the same appearance, dynamics, and speed, as the equivalent
jet at 7S (SEBn), supporting the view that the two jets are essentially symmetrical, with an underlying
jet in the range 150-170 m/s. Secondly, the manifestation of this jet at the surface is normally suppressed
by the presence of large slow-moving formations, which are probably Rossby waves. Thirdly, the
loss of the large dark formations and the narrowing of the belt may have been promoted by the decline
of convective rift activity. Fourthly, these changes seem to represent a reversion to the situation
that existed before 1912, when such appearances were common and were followed cyclically by vigorous
NEB Revivals. Indeed, just such a Revival would ensue in 2012.
