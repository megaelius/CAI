JWST was conceived and built to answer one of the most fundamental questions that humans can address
empirically: "How did the Universe make its first stars?". Our First Lights At REionization (FLARE)
project transforms the quest for the epoch of reionization from the static to the time domain. It
targets the complementary question: "What happened to those first stars?". It will be answered
by observations of the most luminous events: supernovae and accretion on to black holes formed by
direct collapse from the primordial gas clouds. These transients provide direct constraints on
star-formation rates (SFRs) and the truly initial Initial Mass Function (IMF), and they may identify
possible stellar seeds of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Furthermore, our knowledge of the
physics of these events at ultra-low metallicity will be much expanded. JWST's unique capabilities
will detect these most luminous and earliest cosmic messengers easily in fairly shallow observations.
However, these events are very rare at the dawn of cosmic structure formation and so require large
area coverage. Time domain astronomy can be advanced to an unprecedented depth by means of a shallow
field of JWST reaching 27 mag AB in 2 and 4.4 microns over a field as large as 0.1 square degree visited
multiple times each year. Such a survey may set strong constraints or detect massive Pop III SNe at
redshifts beyond 10, pinpointing the redshift of the first stars, or at least their death. Based
on our current knowledge of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), such a survey will find one or more
SLSNe at redshifts above 6 in five years and possibly several direct collapse black holes. Although
JWST is not designed as a wide field survey telescope, we show that such a wide field survey is possible
with JWST and is critical in addressing several of its key scientific goals.
