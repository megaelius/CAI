Making cosmological inferences from the observed galaxy clustering requires accurate predictions
for the mean clustering statistics and their covariances. Those are affected by cosmic variance
-- the statistical noise due to the finite number of harmonics. The cosmic variance can be suppressed
by fixing the amplitudes of the harmonics instead of drawing them from a Gaussian distribution predicted
by the inflation models. Initial realizations also can be generated in pairs with 180 degrees flipped
phases to further reduce the variance. Here, we compare the consequences of using paired-and-fixed
vs Gaussian initial conditions on the average dark matter clustering and covariance matrices predicted
from N-body simulations. As in previous studies, we find no measurable differences between paired-and-fixed
and Gaussian simulations for the average density distribution function, power spectrum and bispectrum.
Yet, the covariances from paired-and-fixed simulations are suppressed in a complicated scale-
and redshift-dependent way. The situation is particularly problematic on the scales of Baryon
Acoustic Oscillations where the covariance matrix of the power spectrum is lower by only 20% compared
to the Gaussian realizations, implying that there is not much of a reduction of the cosmic variance.
The non-trivial suppression, combined with the fact that paired-and-fixed covariances are noisier
than from Gaussian simulations, suggests that there is no path towards obtaining accurate covariance
matrices from paired-and-fixed simulations. Because the covariances are crucial for the observational
estimates of galaxy clustering statistics and cosmological parameters, paired-and-fixed simulations,
though useful for some applications, cannot be used for the production of mock galaxy catalogs.
