Carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars, CH stars and barium stars, among other classes of chemically
peculiar stars, are thought to be products of the interaction of low- and intermediate-mass binaries
which occurred when the most evolved star was in the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. Binary
evolution models predict that if the initial orbital periods of such systems are shorter than a few
thousand days, their orbits should have circularised due to tidal effects. However, observations
of the progeny of AGB binaries show that many of these objects have substantial eccentricities,
up to about 0.9. In this work we explore the impact of wind mass transfer on the orbits of AGB binaries
by performing numerical simulations in which the AGB wind is modelled using a hydrodynamical code
and the stellar dynamics is evolved using an N-body code. We find that in most models wind mass transfer
contributes to the circularisation of the orbit, but on longer timescales than tidal circularisation
if the eccentricity is less than about 0.4. For low initial wind velocities and pseudo-synchronisation
of the donor star, we find a structure resembling wind Roche-lobe overflow near periastron. In this
case, the interaction between the gas and the stars is stronger than for high initial wind velocities
and the orbit shrinks while the eccentricity decreases. In one of our models wind interaction is
found to pump the eccentricity on a similar timescale as tidal circularisation. Although our study
is based on a small sample of models, it offers some insight into the orbital evolution of eccentric
binaries interacting via winds. A larger grid of numerical models for different binary parameters
is needed to test if a regime exists where hydrodynamical eccentricity pumping can effectively
counteract tidal circularisation, and if this can explain the puzzling eccentricities of the descendants
of AGB binaries.
