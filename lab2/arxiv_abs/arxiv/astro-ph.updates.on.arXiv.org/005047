We exploit stellar population models of absorption line indices in the ultraviolet (from 2000 -
3200 Angstrom) to study the spectra of massive galaxies. Our central aim is to investigate the occurrence
at high-redshift of the UV upturn, i.e. the increased UV emission due to old stars observed in massive
galaxies and spiral bulges in the local Universe. We use a large (~275,000) sample of z~0.6 massive
(log M*/Msun > 11.5) galaxies using both individual spectra and stacks and employ a suite of models
including a UV contribution from old populations, spanning various effective temperatures, fuel
consumptions and metallicities. We find that a subset of our indices, Mg I, Fe I, and BL3096, are able
to differentiate between old and young UV ages. We find evidence for old stars contributing to the
UV in massive galaxies, rather than star formation. The data favour models with low/medium upturn
temperatures (10,000 - 25,000K) consistent with local galaxies, depending on the assumed metallicity,
and with a larger fuel (f ~ 0.065 Msun). Models with one typical temperature are favoured over models
with a temperature range, which would be typical of an extended horizontal branch. Old UV-bright
populations are found in the whole galaxy sample (~92%), with a mass fraction peaking around 20-30%.
Upturn galaxies are massive and have redder colours, in agreement with findings in the local Universe.
We find that the upturn phenomenon appears at z~1 and its frequency increases towards lower redshift,
as expected by stellar evolution of low mass stars. Our findings will help constrain stellar evolution
in the exotic UV upturn phase.
