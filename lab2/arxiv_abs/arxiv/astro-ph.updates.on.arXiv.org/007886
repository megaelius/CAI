Giant pulses (GPs) are extremely bright individual pulses of radio pulsar. In microbursts of Crab
pulsar, which is an active GP emitter, zebra-pattern-like spectral structures are observed, which
are reminiscent of the `zebra bands' that are observed in type IV solar radio flares. However, band
spacing linearly increases with the band center frequency of $\sim5-30$\,GHz. In this study, we
propose that the Crab pulsar GP can originate from the coherent instability of plasma near a light
cylinder. Further, the growth of coherent instability can be attributed to the resonance observed
between the cyclotron-resonant-excited wave and the background plasma oscillation. The particles
can be injected into the closed-field line regions owing to magnetic reconnection near a light cylinder.
These particles introduce a large amount of free energy that further causes cyclotron-resonant
instability, which grows and amplifies radiative waves at frequencies close to the electron cyclotron
harmonics that exhibit zebra-pattern-like spectral band structures. Further, these structures
can be modulated by the resonance between the cyclotron-resonant-excited wave and the background
plasma oscillation. In this scenario, the band structures of the Crab pulsar can be well fitted by
a coherent instability model, where the plasma density of a light cylinder should be $\sim10^{13-15}\,\rm{cm^{-3}}$,
with an estimated gradient of $>5.5\times10^5\,\rm{cm^{-4}}$. This process may be accompanied
by high-energy emissions. Similar phenomena are expected to be detected in other types of GP sources
that have magnetic fields of $\simeq10^6$\,G in a light cylinder.
