Aims: We investigated the masses and spatial distributions of pre-stellar and protostellar candidates
in the young, low-mass star forming region Serpens South, where active star formation is known to
occur along a predominant filamentary structure. Previous observations used to study these distributions
have been limited by two important observational factors: (1) sensitivity limits that leave the
lowest-mass sources undetected, or (2) resolution limits that cannot distinguish binaries and/or
cluster members in close proximity. Methods: Recent millimeter-wavelength interferometry observations
can now uncover faint and/or compact sources in order to study a more complete population of protostars,
especially in nearby ($D<500$ pc) clusters. Here we present ALMA observations of 1 mm (Band 6) continuum
in a $3 \times 2$ arcminutes region at the center of Serpens South. Our angular resolution of $\sim1$
arcsec is equivalent to $\sim400$ au, corresponding to scales of envelopes and/or disks of protostellar
sources. Results: We detect 52 sources with 1 mm continuum, and we measure masses of $0.002 - 0.9$
solar masses corresponding to gas and dust in the disk and/or envelope of the protostellar system.
For the deeply embedded (youngest) sources with no IR counterparts, we find evidence of mass segregation
and clustering according to: the Minimum Spanning Tree method, distribution of projected separations
between unique sources, and concentration of higher-mass sources near to the dense gas at the cluster
center. Conclusions: The mass segregation of the mm sources is likely primordial rather than dynamical
given the young age of this cluster, compared with segregation time. This is the first case to show
this for mm sources in a low-mass protostellar cluster environment.
