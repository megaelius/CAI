We study the morphology of the cosmic microwave background temperature and polarization fields
using the shape and alignment parameters, $\beta$ and $\alpha$, that are constructed from the contour
Minkowski tensor. The primary goal of our paper is to understand the effect of weak gravitational
lensing on the morphology of the CMB fields. In order to isolate different physical effects that
can be potentially confused with the effect of lensing, we first study the effect of varying the cosmology
on $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and show that they are relatively insensitive to variation of cosmological
parameters. Next we analyze the signatures of hemispherical anisotropy, and show that information
of such anisotropy in $\alpha$ gets washed out at small angular scales and become pronounced only
at large angular scales. For $\beta$ we find characteristic distortions which vary with the field
threshold. We then study the effect of weak gravitational lensing using simulations of lensed temperature
and $E$ and $B$ modes. We quantify the distortion induced in the fields across different angular
scales. We find that lensing makes structures of all fields increasingly more anisotropic as we
probe down to smaller scales. We find distinct behaviour of morphological distortions as a function
of threshold for the different fields. The effect is small for temperature and $E$ mode, while it
is significantly large for $B$ mode. Further, we find that lensing does not induce statistical anisotropy,
as expected from the isotropic distribution of large scale structure of matter. We expect that the
results obtained in this work will provide insights on the reconstruction of the lensing potential.
