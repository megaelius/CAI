We study the implications of a combined analysis of cosmic standard candles and standard rulers
on the viability of cosmological models beyond the cosmological concordance model. To this end,
we employ data in the form of the joint light-curve analysis supernova compilation, baryon acoustic
oscillations, cosmic microwave background data, and a recently proposed set of Quasars as objects
of known brightness. The advantage of including the latter is that they extend the local distance
measures to redshifts which have previously been out of reach and we investigate how this allows
one to test cosmologies beyond $\Lambda$CDM. We focus on two particular modifications: One is the
theory of a massive tensor field interacting with the standard metric of gravity, so-called bigravity,
and the other conformal gravity, a theory of gravity that has no knowledge of fundamental length
scales. The former of the two constitutes a veritable extension of General Relativity, given that
it adds to the metric tensor of gravity a second dynamical tensor field. The resulting dynamics have
been proposed as a self-accelerating cosmology. Conformal gravity on the other hand is a much more
drastic change of the underlying gravitational theory. Its ignorance towards fundamental length
scales offers a completely different approach to late time acceleration and the so-called cosmological
constant problem. In this sense, both models offer - in one way or another - an explanation for the
cosmological constant problem. We perform a combined cosmological fit which provides strong constraints
on some of these extensions, while some alternative cosmologies are in fact favoured by the data.
We also briefly comment on the implications of the long-standing $H_0$-tension.
