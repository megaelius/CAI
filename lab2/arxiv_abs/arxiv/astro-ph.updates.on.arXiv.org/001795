Recent Planck data confirm that the cosmic microwave background displays the quadru-pole power
suppression together with large scale anomalies. Progressing from previous results, that focused
on the quadrupole anomaly, we strengthen the proposal that the slightly anisotropic ellipsoidal
universe may account for these anomalies. We solved at large scales the Boltzmann equation for the
photon distribution functions by taking into account both the effects of the inflation produced
primordial scalar perturbations and the anisotropy of the geometry in the ellipsoidal universe.
We showed that the low quadrupole temperature correlations allowed us to fix the eccentricity at
decoupling, $e_{\rm dec} \, = \, (0.86 \, \pm \, 0.14) \, 10^{-2}$, and to constraint the direction
of the symmetry axis. We found that the anisotropy of the geometry of the universe contributes only
to the large scale temperature anisotropies without affecting the higher multipoles of the angular
power spectrum. Moreover, we showed that the ellipsoidal geometry of the universe induces sizable
polarization signal at large scales without invoking the reionization scenario. We explicitly
evaluated the quadrupole TE and EE correlations. We found an average large scale polarization $\Delta
T_{pol} \, = \, (1.20 \, \pm \, 0.38) \; \mu K $. We point out that great care is needed in the experimental
determination of the large-scale polarization correlations since the average temperature polarization
could be misinterpreted as foreground emission leading, thereby, to a considerable underestimate
of the cosmic microwave background polarization signal.
