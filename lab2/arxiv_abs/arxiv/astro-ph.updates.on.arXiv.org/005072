The quiet solar corona emits meter-wave thermal bremsstrahlung. Coronal radio emission can only
propagate above that radius, $R_\omega$, where the local plasma frequency eqals the observing
frequency. The radio interferometer LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) observes in its low band (10 --
90 MHz) solar radio emission originating from the middle and upper corona. We present the first solar
aperture synthesis imaging observations in the low band of LOFAR in 12 frequencies each separated
by 5 MHz. From each of these radio maps we infer $R_\omega$, and a scale height temperature, $T$. These
results can be combined into coronal density and temperature profiles. We derived radial intensity
profiles from the radio images. We focus on polar directions with simpler, radial magnetic field
structure. Intensity profiles were modeled by ray-tracing simulations, following wave paths
through the refractive solar corona, and including free-free emission and absorption. We fitted
model profiles to observations with $R_\omega$ and $T$ as fitting parameters. In the low corona,
$R_\omega < 1.5$ solar radii, we find high scale height temperatures up to 2.2e6 K, much more than
the brightness temperatures usually found there. But if all $R_\omega$ values are combined into
a density profile, this profile can be fitted by a hydrostatic model with the same temperature, thereby
confirming this with two independent methods. The density profile deviates from the hydrostatic
model above 1.5 solar radii, indicating the transition into the solar wind. These results demonstrate
what information can be gleaned from solar low-frequency radio images. The scale height temperatures
we find are not only higher than brightness temperatures, but also than temperatures derived from
coronograph or EUV data. Future observations will provide continuous frequency coverage, eliminating
the need for local hydrostatic density models.
