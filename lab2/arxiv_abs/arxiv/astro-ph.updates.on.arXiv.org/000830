We investigate the effect of active galactic nucleus (AGN) variability on the observed connection
between star formation and black hole accretion in extragalactic surveys. Recent studies have
reported relatively weak correlations between observed AGN luminosities and the properties of
AGN hosts, which has been interpreted to imply that there is no direct connection between AGN activity
and star formation. However, AGNs may be expected to vary significantly on a wide range of timescales
(from hours to Myr) that are far shorter than the typical timescale for star formation (>~100
Myr). This variability can have important consequences for observed correlations. We present
a simple model in which all star-forming galaxies host an AGN when averaged over ~100 Myr timescales,
with long-term average AGN accretion rates that are perfectly correlated with the star formation
rate (SFR). We show that reasonable prescriptions for AGN variability reproduce the observed weak
correlations between SFR and L_AGN in typical AGN host galaxies, as well as the general trends in
the observed AGN luminosity functions, merger fractions, and measurements of the average AGN luminosity
as a function of SFR. These results imply there may be a tight connection between AGN activity and
SFR over galaxy evolution timescales, and that the apparent similarities in rest-frame colors,
merger rates, and clustering of AGNs compared to "inactive" galaxies may be due primarily to AGN
variability. The results provide motivation for future deep, wide extragalactic surveys that
can measure the distribution of AGN accretion rates as a function of SFR.
