We present three-dimensional local hydrodynamic simulations of flows around objects embedded
within stellar envelopes using a "wind tunnel" formalism. Our simulations model the common envelope
dynamical inspiral phase in binary star systems in terms of dimensionless flow characteristics.
We present suites of simulations that study the effects of varying the binary mass ratio, stellar
structure, equation of state, relative Mach number of the object's motion through the gas, and density
gradients across the gravitational focusing scale. For each model, we measure coefficients of
accretion and drag experienced by the embedded object. These coefficients regulate the coupled
evolution of the object's masses and orbital tightening during the dynamical inspiral phase of
the common envelope. We extrapolate our simulation results to accreting black holes with masses
comparable to that of the population of LIGO black holes. We demonstrate that the mass and spin accrued
by these black holes per unit orbital tightening are directly related to the ratio of accretion to
drag coefficients. We thus infer that the mass and dimensionless spin of initially non-rotating
black holes change by of order $1\%$ and 0.05, respectively, in a typical example scenario. Our prediction
that the masses and spins of black holes remain largely unmodified by a common envelope phase aids
in the interpretation of the properties of the growing observed population of merging binary black
holes. Even if these black holes passed through a common envelope phase during their assembly, features
of mass and spin imparted by previous evolutionary epochs should be preserved.
