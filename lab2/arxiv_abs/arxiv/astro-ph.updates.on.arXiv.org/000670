While various codes exist to systematically and robustly find haloes and subhaloes in cosmological
simulations (Knebe et al., 2011, Onions et al., 2012), this is the first work to introduce and rigorously
test codes that find tidal debris (streams and other unbound substructure) in fully cosmological
simulations of structure formation. We use one tracking and three non-tracking codes to identify
substructure (bound and unbound) in a Milky Way type simulation from the Aquarius suite (Springel
et al., 2008) and post-process their output with a common pipeline to determine the properties of
these substructures in a uniform way. By using output from a fully cosmological simulation, we also
take a step beyond previous studies of tidal debris that have used simple toy models. We find that
both tracking and non-tracking codes agree well on the identification of subhaloes and more importantly,
the {\em unbound tidal features} associated with them. The distributions of basic properties of
the total substructure distribution (mass, velocity dispersion, position) are recovered with
a scatter of $\sim20%$. Using the tracking code as our reference, we show that the non-tracking codes
identify complex tidal debris with purities of $\sim40%$. Analysing the results of the substructure
finders, we find that the general distribution of {\em substructures} differ significantly from
the distribution of bound {\em subhaloes}. Most importantly, both bound and unbound {\em substructures}
together constitute $\sim18%$ of the host halo mass, which is a factor of $\sim2$ higher than the
fraction in self-bound {\em subhaloes}. However, this result is restricted by the remaining challenge
to cleanly define when an unbound structure has become part of the host halo. Nevertheless, the more
general substructure distribution provides a more complete picture of a halo's accretion history.
