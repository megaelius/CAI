Centaurus A (Cen A) is the nearest radio galaxy discovered as a very-high-energy (VHE; 100 GeV-100
TeV) $\gamma$-ray source by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.). It is a faint VHE $\gamma$-ray
emitter, though its VHE flux exceeds both the extrapolation from early Fermi-LAT observations
as well as expectations from a (misaligned) single-zone synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) description.
The latter satisfactorily reproduces the emission from Cen A at lower energies up to a few GeV. New
observations with H.E.S.S., comparable in exposure time to those previously reported, were performed
and eight years of Fermi-LAT data were accumulated to clarify the spectral characteristics of the
$\gamma$-ray emission from the core of Cen A. The results allow us for the first time to achieve the
goal of constructing a representative, contemporaneous $\gamma$-ray core spectrum of Cen A over
almost five orders of magnitude in energy. Advanced analysis methods, including the template fitting
method, allow detection in the VHE range of the core with a statistical significance of 12$\sigma$
on the basis of 213 hours of total exposure time. The spectrum in the energy range of 250 GeV-6 TeV is
compatible with a power-law function with a photon index $\Gamma=2.52\pm0.13_{\mathrm{stat}}\pm0.20_{\mathrm{sys}}$.
An updated Fermi-LAT analysis provides evidence for spectral hardening by $\Delta\Gamma\simeq0.4\pm0.1$
at $\gamma$-ray energies above $2.8^{+1.0}_{-0.6}$ GeV at a level of $4.0\sigma$. The fact that
the spectrum hardens at GeV energies and extends into the VHE regime disfavour a single-zone SSC
interpretation for the overall spectral energy distribution (SED) of the core and is suggestive
of a new $\gamma$-ray emitting component connecting the high-energy emission above the break energy
to the one observed at VHE energies.
