Bayesian atmospheric retrieval tools can place constraints on the properties of brown dwarfs and
hot Jupiters atmospheres. To fully exploit these methods, high signal-to-noise spectral libraries
with well-understood uncertainties are essential. We present a high signal-to-noise spectral
library (1.10-1.69 microns) of the thermal emission of 76 brown dwarfs and hot Jupiters. All our
spectra have been acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 instrument and
its G141 grism. The near-infrared spectral types of these objects range from L4 to Y1. Eight of our
targets have estimated masses below the deuterium-burning limit. We analyze the database to identify
peculiar objects and/or multiple systems, concluding that this sample includes two very-low-surface-gravity
objects and five intermediate-surface-gravity objects. In addition, spectral indices designed
to search for composite atmosphere brown dwarfs, indicate that eight objects in our sample are strong
candidates to have such atmospheres. None of these objects are overluminous, thus their composite
atmospheres are unlikely a companion-induced artifact. Five of the eight confirmed candidates
have been reported as photometrically variable, suggesting that composite atmospheric indices
are useful in identifying brown dwarfs with strongly heterogeneous cloud covers. We compare hot
Jupiters and brown dwarfs in a near-infrared color-magnitude diagram. We confirm that the coldest
hot Jupiters in our sample have spectra similar to mid-L dwarfs, and the hottest hot Jupiters have
spectra similar to those of M-dwarfs. Our sample provides a uniform dataset of a broad range of ultracool
atmospheres, allowing large-scale, comparative studies, and providing a HST legacy spectral
library.
