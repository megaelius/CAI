Understanding the variability of galaxy star formation histories (SFHs) across a range of timescales
provides insight into the underlying physical processes that regulate star formation within galaxies.
We compile the SFHs of galaxies at $z=0$ from an extensive set of models, ranging from cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations (Illustris, IllustrisTNG, Mufasa, Simba, EAGLE), zoom simulations
(FIRE-2, g14, and Marvel/Justice League), semi-analytic models (Santa Cruz SAM) and empirical
models (UniverseMachine), and quantify the variability of these SFHs on different timescales
using the power spectral density (PSD) formalism. We find that the PSDs are well described by broken
power-laws, and variability on long timescales ($\gtrsim1$ Gyr) accounts for most of the power
in galaxy SFHs. Most hydrodynamical models show increased variability on shorter timescales ($\lesssim300$
Myr) with decreasing stellar mass. Quenching can induce $\sim0.4-1$ dex of additional power on
timescales $>1$ Gyr. The dark matter accretion histories of galaxies have remarkably self-similar
PSDs and are coherent with the in-situ star formation on timescales $>3$ Gyr. There is considerable
diversity among the different models in their (i) power due to SFR variability at a given timescale,
(ii) amount of correlation with adjacent timescales (PSD slope), (iii) evolution of median PSDs
with stellar mass, and (iv) presence and locations of breaks in the PSDs. The PSD framework is a useful
space to study the SFHs of galaxies since model predictions vary widely. Observational constraints
in this space will help constrain the relative strengths of the physical processes responsible
for this variability.
