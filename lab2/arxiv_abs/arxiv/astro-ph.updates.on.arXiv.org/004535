We discuss the spectral analysis of a sample of 63 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) detected above a limiting
flux of $S(8-24$ keV$)=7\times10^{-14}$ erg/s/cm$^2$ in the multi-tiered NuSTAR Extragalactic
Survey program. The sources span a redshift range z=0-2.1 (median $\langle$z$\rangle=$0.58).
The spectral analysis is performed over the broad 0.5-24 keV energy range, combining NuSTAR with
Chandra and/or XMM-Newton data and employing empirical and physically motivated models. This
constitutes the largest sample of AGN selected at $ >10$ keV to be homogeneously spectrally analyzed
at these flux levels. We study the distribution of spectral parameters such as photon index, column
density ($N_{\rm H}$), reflection parameter ($R$) and 10-40 keV luminosity ($L_{X}$). Heavily
obscured ($\log [N_{\rm H}/cm^{-2}]\ge23$) and Compton Thick (CT; $\log [N_{\rm H}/cm^{-2}]\ge24$)
AGN constitute $\sim$25% (15-17 sources) and $\sim$2-3% ( 1-2 sources) of the sample, respectively.
The observed $N_{\rm H}$ distribution fairly agrees with predictions of Cosmic X-ray Background
population synthesis models (CXBPSM). We estimate the intrinsic fraction of AGN as a function of
$N_{H}$, accounting for the bias against obscured AGN in a flux-selected sample. The fraction of
CT AGN relative to $\log [N_{\rm H}/cm^{-2}]=20-24$ AGN is poorly constrainted, formally in the
range 2-56% (90% upper limit of 66%). We derived a fraction ($f_{abs}$) of obscured AGN ($\log [N_{\rm
H}/cm^{-2}]=22-24$) as a function of $L_{X}$ in agreement with CXBPSM and previous z < 1 X-ray determinations.
Furthermore $f_{abs}$ at z=0.1-0.5 and $\log (L_{X}/erg$ $s^{-1})\approx43.6-44.3$ agrees
with observational measurements/trends obtained over larger redshift intervals. We report a
significant anti-correlation of $R$ with $L_{X}$ (confirmed by our companion paper on stacked
spectra) with considerable scatter around the median $R$ values.
