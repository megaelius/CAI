Mean-field dynamo theory suggests that turbulent convection in a rotating layer of electrically-conducting
fluid produces a significant alpha-effect, which is one of the key ingredients in any mean-field
dynamo model. Provided that this alpha-effect operates more efficiently than (turbulent) magnetic
diffusion, such a system should be capable of sustaining a large-scale dynamo. However, in the Boussinesq
model that was considered by Cattaneo&Hughes (2006) the dynamo produced small-scale, intermittent
magnetic fields with no significant large-scale component. In this paper, we consider the compressible
analogue of the rotating convective layer that was considered by Cattaneo&Hughes (2006).
Varying the horizontal scale of the computational domain, we investigate the dependence of the
dynamo upon the rotation rate. Our simulations indicate that these turbulent compressible flows
can drive a small-scale dynamo but, even when the layer is rotating very rapidly (with a mid-layer
Taylor number of Ta=10^8), we find no evidence for the generation of a significant large-scale component
of the magnetic field on a dynamical timescale. Like Cattaneo&Hughes(2006), we measure a negligible
(time-averaged) alpha-effect when a uniform horizontal magnetic field is imposed across the computational
domain. Although the total horizontal magnetic flux is a conserved quantity in these simulations,
the (depth-dependent) horizontally-averaged magnetic field always exhibits strong fluctuations.
If these fluctuations are artificially suppressed within the code, we measure a significant mean
electromotive force that is comparable to that found in related calculations in which the alpha-effect
is measured using the test-field method, even though we observe no large-scale dynamo action.
