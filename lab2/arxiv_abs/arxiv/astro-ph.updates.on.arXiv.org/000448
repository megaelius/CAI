Context. It has been proposed that the temporal coincidence of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) and a type
Ib/c supernova (SN) can be explained with the concept of induced gravitational collapse (IGC),
induced by the matter ejected from an SN Ib/c accreting onto a neutron star (NS). The NS is expected
to reach the critical mass necessary for it to collapse to a black hole (BH) and emit a GRB. We found
a standard luminosity light curve behavior in the late-time X-ray emission of this subclass of GRBs.
Aims. We test if this standard behavior in the luminosity found in this subclass of GRBs can become
a redshift estimator of these sources. Methods. We selected a sample of GRBs that belong to this subclass
of IGC GRBs associated to an SN (IGC GRB-SN sources). These sources have an isotropic energy $E_{iso}
> 10^{52}$ erg and their cosmological redshifts are in the range of $z = 0.49-1.261$. We focused
on the corresponding X-ray luminosity light curves. Results. We find that all GRBs of the sample
with measured redshift present a standard luminosity late-time light curve in the $0.3-10$ keV
rest-frame energy range. We used these results to estimate the GRB redshift of the sample without
a measured redshift and found results consistent with other possible redshift indicators. Conclusions.
The standard late-time X-ray luminosity light curve of all GRBs of the sample shows a common physical
mechanism in this particular phase of the X-ray emission, possibly related to the creation of the
NS from the SN process. This scaling law moreover represents strong evidence of very low or even absent
beaming in this late phase of the X-ray afterglow emission process. This could be a fundamental tool
for estimating the redshift of GRBs that belong to this subclass of events. We are currently expanding
this subclass of GRBs to further verify the universal validity of this new redshift estimation method.
