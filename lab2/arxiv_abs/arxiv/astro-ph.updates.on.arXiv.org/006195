Aims. As a new approach to the study of resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxies, our goal
is to demonstrate in NGC300 that integral field spectroscopy with high spatial resolution and excellent
seeing conditions reaches an unprecedented depth in severely crowded fields. Methods. MUSE observations
with seven pointings in NGC300 have resulted in datacubes that are analyzed in four ways: (1) PSF-fitting
3D spectroscopy with PampelMUSE yields deblended spectra of individually distinguishable stars.
The technique also provides samples of planetary nebulae that are complete down to m5007=28. (2)
pseudo-monochromatic images, created at the wavelengths of the most important emission lines
and corrected for continuum light by using the P3D visualization tool, provide maps of HII regions,
SNR, and the diffuse ISM at a high level of sensitivity, allowing for the discovery of planetary nebulae,
WR stars etc. (3) The use of the P3D line-fitting tool yields emission line fluxes, surface brightness,
and kinematic information for gaseous objects, corrected for absorption line profiles of the underlying
stellar population. (4) Visual inspection of the datacubes is demonstrated to be effcient for data
mining and the discovery of background galaxies and unusual objects. Results. We present a catalogue
of luminous stars, rare stars such as WR and other emission line stars, carbon stars, symbiotic star
candidates, planetary nebulae, HII regions, supernova remnants, giant shells, peculiar diffuse
and filamentary emission line objects, and background galaxies, along with their spectra. Conclusions.
The technique of crowded-field 3D spectroscopy is capable of deblending individual bright stars,
the unresolved background of faint stars, gaseous nebulae, and the diffuse component of the interstellar
medium, resulting in unprecedented legacy value for observations of nearby galaxies with MUSE.
