(Abridged) Mid- and far-infrared observations of the environment around embedded protostars
reveal a plethora of high excitation molecular and atomic emission lines. In this work we present
spectro-imaging observations of the HH211 system with Herschel/PACS that record emission from
major molecular (CO, H2O and OH) and atomic coolants (e.g. [OI]). Molecular lines are mainly exited
at the terminal bowshocks of the outflow and around the position of the protostar. All lines show
maxima at the southeast bowshock with the exception of water emission that peaks around the central
source. Excitation analysis in all positions shows that CO and H$_2$O are mainly thermally excited
at T~ 350 K and 90 K respectively, with the CO showing a second temperature component at 750 K towards
the southeast peak. Excitation analysis breaks down in the case of OH, indicating that the molecule
is non-thermally excited. Comparisons between the CO and H2 column densities suggest that the CO
abundance value in shocks can be up to an order of magnitude lower than the canonical value of 10$^{-4}$.
The water ortho-to-para ratio around the protostar is only 0.65, indicating low-temperature water
ice formation followed by non-destructive photodesorption from the dust grains. Therefore the
low ortho-to-para ratio in water that can be interpreted in terms of formation from a primordial
gas reservoir in the protostellar envelope. The two-sided total atomic mass flux estimated from
the [OI] jet sums to 1.65$\times 10^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, a value that is very close to the
mass flux previously estimated for the SiO jet and the H$_2$ outflow. These comparisons render HH211
the first embedded system where an atomic jet is demonstrably shown to possess enough momentum to
drive the observed molecular jets and large scale outflows.
