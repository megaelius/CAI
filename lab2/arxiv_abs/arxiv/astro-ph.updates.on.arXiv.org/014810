Aims. In this study, we determine the morphology and mass-loss rate of jets emanating from the companion
in post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) binary stars with a circumbinary disk. In doing so,
we also determine the mass accretion rates on to the companion and investigate the source feeding
the circum-companion accretion disk. Methods. We perform a spatio-kinematic modelling of the
jet of two well-sampled post-AGB binaries, BD+46442 and IRAS19135+3937, by fitting the orbital
phased time series of H-alpha spectra. Once the jet geometry, velocity and scaled density structure
are computed, we carry out radiative transfer modelling of the jet for the first four Balmer lines
to determine the jet densities, thus allowing us to compute the jet mass-loss rates and mass accretion
rates. Results. The spatio-kinematic model of the jet reproduces the observed absorption feature
in the H-alpha lines. In both objects, the jets have an inner region with extremely low density. Using
our radiative transfer model, we find the full three-dimensional density structure of both jets.
From these results, we can compute mass-loss rates of the jets, which are of the order of 10^-7 - 10^-5
M_sol/yr. We estimate mass accretion rates onto the companion of 10^-6 - 10^-4 M_sol/yr. Conclusions.
Based on the mass accretion rates found for these two objects, we conclude that the circumbinary
disk is most likely the source feeding the circum-companion accretion disk. This is in agreement
with the observed depletion patterns in post-AGB binaries. The high accretion rates from the circumbinary
disk imply that the lifetime of the disk will be short. Mass-transfer from the post-AGB star cannot
be excluded in these systems, but it is unlikely to provide a sufficient mass-transfer rate to sustain
the observed jet mass-loss rates.
