Upcoming experiments such as the SKA will provide huge quantities of data. Fast modelling of the
high-redshift 21cm signal will be crucial for efficiently comparing these data sets with theory.
The most detailed theoretical predictions currently come from numerical simulations and from
faster but less accurate semi-numerical simulations. Recently, machine learning techniques
have been proposed to emulate the behaviour of these semi-numerical simulations with drastically
reduced time and computing cost. We compare the viability of five such machine learning techniques
for emulating the 21cm power spectrum of the publicly-available code SimFast21. Our best emulator
is a multilayer perceptron with three hidden layers, reproducing SimFast21 power spectra $10^8$
times faster than the simulation with 4% mean squared error averaged across all redshifts and input
parameters. The other techniques (interpolation, Gaussian processes regression, and support
vector machine) have slower prediction times and worse prediction accuracy than the multilayer
perceptron. All our emulators can make predictions at any redshift and scale, which gives more flexible
predictions but results in significantly worse prediction accuracy at lower redshifts. We then
present a proof-of-concept technique for mapping between two different simulations, exploiting
our best emulator's fast prediction speed. We demonstrate this technique to find a mapping between
SimFast21 and another publicly-available code 21cmFAST. We observe a noticeable offset between
the simulations for some regions of the input space. Such techniques could potentially be used as
a bridge between fast semi-numerical simulations and accurate numerical radiative transfer simulations.
