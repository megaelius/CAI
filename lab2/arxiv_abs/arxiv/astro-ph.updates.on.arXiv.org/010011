Our knowledge and understanding of the Universe is mainly based on observations of the electromagnetic
radiation in a wide range of wavelengths. Only during the past two decades, new kinds of detectors
have been developed, exploiting other forms of cosmic probes: individual photons with energy above
the GeV, charged particles and antiparticles, neutrinos and, finally, gravitational waves. These
new ``telescopes'' leaded to unexpected breakthroughs. Years 2016 and 2017 have seen the dawn of
the astrophysics and cosmology with gravitational waves, awarded with the 2017 Nobel Prize. The
events GW150914 (the first black hole-black hole merger) and GW170817 (the coalescence of two neutron
stars, producing a short gamma-ray burst and follow-up observed by more than 70 observatories on
all continents and in space) represent really milestones in science that every physicist (senior
or in formation) should appreciate. In this document, after an accessible discussion on the generation
and propagation of GWs, the key features of observable quantities (the strain, the GW frequency
$\nu_{gw}$, and $\dot \nu_{gw}$) of GW150914 and GW170817 are discussed using Newtonian physics,
dimensional analysis and analogies with electromagnetic waves. The objective is to show how astrophysical
quantities (the initial and final masses of merging objects, the energy loss, the distance, their
spin) are derived from observables. The results from the fully general-relativistic analysis
published in the two discovery papers are compared with the output of our simple treatment. Then,
some of the outcomes of GW observations are discussed in terms of multimessenger astrophysics.
