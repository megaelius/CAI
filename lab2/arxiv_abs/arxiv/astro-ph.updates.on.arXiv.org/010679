We study the effects of an encounter between a wandering cosmic object (WCO) of 0.1 solar mass and
some Kuiperian Objects (KO). First, we let the WCO cross the out-skirt of ou Kuiper belt. Such encounters
can produce two types of solar objects: Eccentric Kuiper Objects of type I (EKO-I) whose perihelion
is comparable to, but always smaller than the aphelion of the initial KO and Eccentric Kuiper Objects
of type II (EKO-II) whose perihelion can be as small as a few AU. EKO-I tend to have a fairly large range
of eccentricities, but EKO-II tend to have very large eccentricities. Both tend to be produced in
clusters similar to those observed in Extreme TransNeptunian Objects (ETNO). When a WCO crosses
the path of an EKO-I, it will produce two main classes of objects: Far Kuiper Objects (FKO) of types
I and II. The Sednitos discovered in the past years fit the FKO-I class with their large major axis
and fairly large eccentricity, while the FKO-II class is different with its large major axis but
smaller eccentricity and opposite spinning direction. When a WCO encounters an EKO-II, the latter
can remain in the same class, spinning in either direction, it can also en up in the EKO-I class also
spinning in either direction, but it can also be sent onto orbits with extremely long semi-major
axis, relatively small eccentricity where both spins are allowed. This FKO-III class could be likened
to the Lower Oort Cloud Objects as their major axis is a fair fraction of a light-year. These results
lead us to consider the possibility that the Kuiper Belt was once substantially larger than it is
now, perhaps 90 AU. We find some evidence of this scenario in current astronomical data.
