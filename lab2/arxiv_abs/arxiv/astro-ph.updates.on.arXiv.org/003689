In this series of papers, we model the formation and evolution of the photoionized region and its
observational signatures during massive star formation. Here we focus on the early break out of
the photoionized region into the outflow cavity. Using results of 3-D magnetohydrodynamic-outflow
simulations and protostellar evolution calculations, we perform post-processing radiative-transfer.
The photoionized region first appears at a protostellar mass of 10Msun in our fiducial model, and
is confined to within 10-100AU by the dense inner outflow, similar to some observed very small hypercompact
HII regions. Since the ionizing luminosity of the massive protostar increases dramatically as
Kelvin-Helmholz (KH) contraction proceeds, the photoionized region breaks out to the entire outflow
region in <10,000yr. Accordingly, the radio free-free emission brightens significantly in this
stage. In our fiducial model, the radio luminosity at 10 GHz changes from 0.1 mJy kpc2 at m=11Msun
to 100 mJy kpc2 at 16Msun, while the infrared luminosity increases by less than a factor of two. The
radio spectral index also changes in the break-out phase from the optically thick value of 2 to the
partially optically thin value of 0.6. Additionally, we demonstrate that short-timescale variation
in free-free flux would be induced by an accretion burst. The outflow density is enhanced in the accretion
burst phase, which leads to a smaller ionized region and weaker free-free emission. The radio luminosity
may decrease by one order of magnitude during such bursts, while the infrared luminosity is much
less affected, since internal protostellar luminosity dominates over accretion luminosity after
KH contraction starts. Such variability may be observable on timescales as short 10-100 yr, if accretion
bursts are driven by disk instabilities.
