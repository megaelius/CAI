We present a tally of Milky Way late-type dwarf stars in 68 WFC3 pure-parallel fields (227 arcmin^2)
from the Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies (BoRG) survey for high-redshift galaxies. Using spectroscopically
identified M-dwarfs in two public surveys, the CANDELS and the ERS mosaics, we identify a morphological
selection criterion using the half-light radius (r50), a near-infrared J-H, G-J color region where
M-dwarfs are found, and a V-J relation with M-dwarf subtype. We apply this morphological selection
of stellar objects, color-color selection of M-dwarfs and optical-near-infrared color subtyping
to compile a catalog of 274 M-dwarfs belonging to the disk of the Milky Way with a limiting magnitude
of m_F125W < 24. Based on the M-dwarfs statistics, we conclude that (a) the previously identified
North/South discrepancy in M-dwarf numbers persists in our sample; there are more M-dwarfs in the
Northern fields on average than in Southern ones, (b) the Milky Way's single disk scale-height for
M-dwarfs is 0.3-4 kpc, depending on sub-type, (c) the scale-height depends on M-dwarf subtype with
early type (M0-4) high scale-height (z0=3-4 kpc) and later types M5 and above in the thin disk (z0=0.3-0.5
kpc), (d) a second component is visible in the vertical distribution, with a different, much higher
scale-height in the Southern Fields compared to the Northern ones. We report the M-dwarf component
of the Sagittarius stream in one of our fields with 11 confirmed M-dwarfs, 7 of which are at the stream's
distance. The dwarf scale-height and the relative low incidence in our fields of L- and T-dwarfs
in these fields makes it unlikely that these stars will be interlopers in great numbers in color-selected
samples go high-redshift galaxies. The relative ubiquity of M-dwarfs however will make them ideal
tracers of Galactic Halo substructure with EUCLID and reference stars for JWST observations.
