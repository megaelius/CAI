Aims: We use new deep XMM-Newton observations of the northern disk of M 31 to trace the hot interstellar
medium (ISM) in unprecedented detail and to characterise the physical properties of the X-ray emitting
plasmas. Methods: We use all XMM-Newton data up to and including our new observations to produce
the most detailed image yet of the hot ISM in a grand design spiral galaxy such as our own. We compare
the X-ray morphology to multi-wavelength studies in the literature to put it in context of the multi-phase
ISM. We perform spectral analyses on the extended emission using our new observations as they offer
sufficient depth and count statistics to constrain the plasma properties. Data from the Panchromatic
Hubble Andromeda Treasury are used to estimate the energy injected by massive stars and their supernovae
and we compare this to the hot gas properties. Results: The brightest emission regions were found
to be correlated with populations of massive stars, notably in the 10 kpc star-forming ring. The
plasma temperatures in the ring regions are ~0.2 keV up to ~0.6 keV. We suggest this emission is hot
ISM heated in massive stellar clusters and superbubbles. We derive X-ray luminosities, densities,
and pressures for the gas in each region. We also found large extended emission filling low density
gaps in the dust morphology of the northern disk, notably between the 5 kpc and 10 kpc star-forming
rings. We propose that the hot gas was heated and expelled into the gaps by the populations of massive
stars in the rings. Conclusions: It is clear that the massive stellar populations are responsible
for heating the ISM to X-ray emitting temperatures, filling their surroundings, and possibly driving
the hot gas into the low density regions. Overall, the morphology and spectra of the hot gas in the
northern disk of M 31 is similar to other galaxy disks.
