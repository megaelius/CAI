ASAS J174406+2446.8 was originally found as a $\delta$ Scuti-type pulsating star with the period
P=0.189068 $days$ by ASAS survey. However, the LAMOST stellar parameters reveal that it is far beyond
the red edge of pulsational instability strip on the $\log g-T$ diagram of $\delta$ Scuti pulsating
stars. To understand the physical properties of the variable star, we observed it by the 1.0-m Cassegrain
reflecting telescope at Yunnan Observatories. Multi-color light curves in B, V, R$_{c}$ and I$_{c}$
bands were obtained and are analyzed by using the W-D program. It is found that this variable star
is a shallow-contact binary with an EB-type light curve and an orbital period of 0.3781\,days rather
than a $\delta$ Scuti star. It is a W-subtype contact binary with a mass ratio of $1.135(\pm0.019)$
and a fill-out factor of $10.4(\pm5.6)\,\%$. The situation of ASAS J174406+2446.8 resembles those
of other EB-type marginal-contact binaries such as UU Lyn, II Per and GW Tau. All of them are at a key
evolutionary phase from a semi-detached configuration to a contact system predicted by the thermal
relaxation oscillation theory. The linear ephemeris was corrected by using 303 new determined
times of light minimum. It is detected that the O - C curve shows a sinusoidal variationthat could
be explained by the light-travel-time effect via the presence of a cool red dwarf. The present investigation
reveals that some of the $\delta$ Scuti-type stars beyond the red edge of pulsating instability
strip on the $\log g-T$ diagram are misclassified eclipsing binaries. To understand their structures
and evolutionary states, more studies are required in the future.
