We present a measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0$ using the gravitational wave (GW) event GW190814,
which resulted from the coalescence of a 23 $M_\odot$ black hole with a 2.6 $M_\odot$ compact object,
as a standard siren. No compelling electromagnetic counterpart with associated host galaxy has
been identified for this event, thus our analysis accounts for $\sim$ 2,700 potential host galaxies
within a statistical framework. The redshift information is obtained from the photometric redshift
(photo-$z$) catalog from the Dark Energy Survey. The luminosity distance is provided by the gravitational
wave sky map published by the LIGO/Virgo Collaboration. Since this GW event has the second-smallest
sky localization area after GW170817, GW190814 is likely to provide the best constraint on cosmology
from a single standard siren without identifying an electromagnetic counterpart. Our analysis
uses photo-$z$ probability distribution functions and corrects for photo-$z$ biases. We also
reanalyze the binary-black hole GW170814 within this updated framework. We explore how our findings
impact the $H_0$ constraints from GW170817, the only GW merger associated with a unique host galaxy,
and therefore the most powerful standard siren to date. From a combination of GW190814, GW170814
and GW170817, our analysis yields $H_0 = 69.0^{+ 14}_{- 7.5 }~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ (68% Highest
Density Interval, HDI) for a prior in $H_0$ uniform between $[20,140]~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$.
The addition of GW190814 and GW170814 to GW170817 improves the 68% HDI from GW170817 alone by $\sim
12\%$, showing how well-localized mergers without counterparts can provide a marginal contribution
to standard siren measurements, provided that a complete galaxy catalog is available at the location
of the event.
