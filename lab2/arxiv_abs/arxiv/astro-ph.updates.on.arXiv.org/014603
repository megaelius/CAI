Extremely Large Telescopes have overwhelmingly opted for the Pyramid wavefront sensor (PyWFS)
over the more widely used Shack-Hartmann WaveFront Sensor (SHWFS) to perform their Single Conjugate
Adaptive Optics (SCAO) mode. The PyWFS, a sensor based on Fourier filtering, has proven to be highly
successful in many astronomy applications. However, it exhibits non-linearity behaviors that
lead to a reduction of its sensitivity when working with non-zero residual wavefronts. This so-called
Optical Gains (OG) effect, degrades the close loop performance of SCAO systems and prevents accurate
correction of Non-Common Path Aberrations (NCPA). In this paper, we aim at computing the OG using
a fast and agile strategy in order to control the PyWFS measurements in adaptive optics closed loop
systems. Using a novel theoretical description of the PyFWS, which is based on a convolutional model,
we are able to analytically predict the behavior of the PyWFS in closed-loop operation. This model
enables us to explore the impact of residual wavefront error on particular aspects such as sensitivity
and associated OG. The proposed method relies on the knowledge of the residual wavefront statistics
and enables automatic estimation of the current OG. End-to-End numerical simulations are used
to validate our predictions and test the relevance of our approach. We demonstrate, using on non-invasive
strategy, that our method provides an accurate estimation of the OG. The model itself only requires
AO telemetry data to derive statistical information on atmospheric turbulence. Furthermore,
we show that by only using an estimation of the current Fried parameter r_0 and the basic system-level
characteristics, OGs can be estimated with an accuracy of less than 10%. Finally, we highlight the
importance of OG estimation in the case of NCPA compensation. The proposed method is applied to the
PyWFS.
