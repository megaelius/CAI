We present the $0.6<z<2.6$ evolution of the ionized gas velocity dispersion in 175 star-forming
disk galaxies based on data from the full KMOS$^{\rm 3D}$ integral field spectroscopic survey.
In a forward-modelling Bayesian framework including instrumental effects and beam-smearing,
we fit simultaneously the observed galaxy velocity and velocity dispersion along the kinematic
major axis to derive the intrinsic velocity dispersion $\sigma_0$. We find a reduction of the average
intrinsic velocity dispersion of disk galaxies as a function of cosmic time, from $\sigma_0\sim45$
km s$^{-1}$ at $z\sim2.3$ to $\sigma_0\sim30$ km s$^{-1}$ at $z\sim0.9$. There is substantial
intrinsic scatter ($\sigma_{\sigma_0, {\rm int}}\approx10$ km s$^{-1}$) around the best-fit
$\sigma_0-z$-relation beyond what can be accounted for from the typical measurement uncertainties
($\delta\sigma_0\approx12$ km s$^{-1}$), independent of other identifiable galaxy parameters.
This potentially suggests a dynamic mechanism such as minor mergers or variation in accretion being
responsible for the scatter. Putting our data into the broader literature context, we find that
ionized and atomic+molecular velocity dispersions evolve similarly with redshift, with the ionized
gas dispersion being $\sim10-15$ km s$^{-1}$ higher on average. We investigate the physical driver
of the on average elevated velocity dispersions at higher redshift, and find that our galaxies are
at most marginally Toomre-stable, suggesting that their turbulent velocities are powered by gravitational
instabilities, while stellar feedback as a driver alone is insufficient. This picture is supported
through comparison with a state-of-the-art analytical model of galaxy evolution.
