The higher order gravitational moments of a differentially rotating planet are greatly affected
or even dominated by the near surface differential flow. Unlike the contribution from rigid body
rotation, this part of the gravity field can be well estimated by linear theory when the differential
rotation is on cylinders and the corresponding gravity field arises from the higher order moments
directly introduced by that flow. In the context of an n = 1 polytrope, we derive approximate analytical
formulas for the gravity moments. We find that $\Delta J_{2\mathrm{n}}$ is typically at most a few
times $(-1)^{n+1} \; a \; q \; d^{5/2}$, where $a$ is the amplitude of the differential rotation (as
a fraction of the background rigid body rotation), $q = \Omega^2 R^3 / G M$ is the usual dimensionless
measure of rotation for the planet (mass $M$, radius $R$), and $d << 1$ is the characteristic depth
of the flow as a fraction of the planetary radius. Applied to Saturn, with $a$ set by the observed surface
wind amplitude, we find first that the observed signs of the $\Delta J_{2\mathrm{n}}$ are a trivial
consequence of the definition of the corresponding Legendre polynomials, but the {\it Cassini}
observations can not be explained by a simple exponentially decaying flow and instead require a
substantial retrograde flow at depth and a larger $d$ than the simple scaling suggests. This is consistent
with the results reported by \citet{Iess2019}. However, there is no fluid dynamical requirement
that the flows observed in the atmosphere are a guide to the flows thousands of km deeper. We explore
a wide range of flow depths and amplitudes which yield values for $\Delta J_{\mathrm{n}}$ that are
acceptable within the error estimates and thus highlight the inherent non-uniqueness of inferences
made from the higher order gravity moments.
