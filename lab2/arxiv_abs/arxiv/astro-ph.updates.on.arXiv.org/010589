Many disc-type post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars are chemically peculiar, showing
underabundances of refractory elements in their photospheres that correlate with condensation
temperature. The aim of this paper is to investigate how accretion from a circumbinary disc can cause
this phenomenon of depletion and how this impacts the evolution of post-AGB stars. We used the \texttt{MESA}
code to evolve stars in the post-AGB phase, while including accretion of metal-poor gas. We compared
the models to a sample of 58 observed disc-type post-AGB stars with chemical abundance data. For
each of these stars, we estimated the luminosity and the mass using the Gaia distance. We modelled
the accretion rate onto the binary from a viscously evolving disc for a range of initial accretion
rates and disc masses. We find that large initial accretion rates ($\gtrsim 3\times10^{-7}$ $M_\odot$/yr)
and large initial disc masses ($\sim10^{-2}$ $M_\odot$) are needed to reproduce the observed depleted
post-AGB stars. Based on these high accretion rates, the evolution timescale of post-AGB stars
can be significantly extended by a factor between two and five. We distinguish depletion patterns
that are unsaturated (plateau profile) from those that are saturated, and we expect that post-red
giant branch (post-RGB) stars are much more likely to show an unsaturated abundance pattern compared
to post-AGB stars. Finally, because of the slower evolution of the low-mass post-RGB stars, we find
that these systems can become depleted at lower effective temperatures ($< 5000$ K). We conclude
that accretion from a circumbinary disc successfully accounts for the chemical peculiarity of
post-AGB stars.
