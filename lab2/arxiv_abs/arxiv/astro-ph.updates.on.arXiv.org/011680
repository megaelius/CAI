We developed a spectroscopic monitoring project to investigate the kinematics of the broad-line
region (BLR) in active galactic nuclei (AGN) with ultra-fast outflows (UFOs). Mrk~79 is a radio-quiet
AGN with UFOs and warm absorbers, had been monitored by three reverberation mapping (RM) campaigns,
but its BLR kinematics is not understood yet. In this paper, we report the results from a new RM-campaign
of Mrk~79, which was undertaken by Lijiang 2.4-m telescope. Mrk~79 is seeming to come out the faint
state, the mean flux approximates a magnitude fainter than historical record. We successfully
measured the lags of the broad emission lines including H$\beta~\lambda4861$, H$\gamma~\lambda4340$,
He II $\lambda4686$ and He I $\lambda5876$ with respect to the varying AGN continuum. Based on the
broad H$\beta~\lambda4861$ line, we measured black hole (BH) mass of $M_{\bullet}=5.13^{+1.57}_{-1.55}\times10^{7}M_{\odot}$,
estimated accretion rates of ${\dot{M}_{\bullet}}=(0.05\pm0.02)~L_{\rm Edd}~c^{-2}$, indicating
that Mrk~79 is a sub-Eddington accretor. We found that Mrk~79 deviates from the canonical Radius$-$Luminosity
relationship. The marginal blueshift of the broad He II $\lambda4686$ line detected from rms spectrum
indicates outflow of high-ionization gas. The velocity-resolved lag profiles of the broad H$\gamma~\lambda4340$,
H$\beta~\lambda4861$, and He I $\lambda5876$ lines show similar signatures that the largest lag
occurs in the red wing of the lines then the lag decreases to both sides. These signatures should suggest
that the BLR of Keplerian motion probably exists the outflow gas motion. All findings including
UFOs, warm absorbers, and the kinematics of high- and low-ionization BLR, may provide an indirect
evidence that the BLR of Mrk~79 probably originates from disk wind.
