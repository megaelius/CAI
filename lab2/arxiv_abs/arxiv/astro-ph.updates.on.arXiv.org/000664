Ion-neutral collisions may lead to the damping of Alfven waves in chromospheric and prominence
plasmas. Neutral helium atoms enhance the damping in certain temperature interval, where the ratio
of neutral helium and neutral hydrogen atoms is increased. Therefore, the height-dependence of
ionization degrees of hydrogen and helium may influence the damping rate of Alfven waves. We aim
to study the effect of neutral helium in the damping of Alfven waves in stratified partially ionized
plasma of the solar chromosphere. We consider a magnetic flux tube, which is expanded up to 1000 km
height and then becomes vertical due to merging with neighboring tubes, and study the dynamics of
linear torsional Alfven waves in the presence of neutral hydrogen and neutral helium atoms. We start
with three-fluid description of plasma and consequently derive single-fluid magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) equations for torsional Alfven waves. Thin flux tube approximation allows to obtain the dispersion
relation of the waves in the lower part of tubes, while the spatial dependence of steady-state Alfven
waves is governed by Bessel type equation in the upper part of tubes. Consecutive derivation of single-fluid
MHD equations results in a new Cowling diffusion coefficient in the presence of neutral helium which
is different from previously used one. We found that shorter-period (< 5 s) torsional Alfven
waves damp quickly in the chromospheric network due to ion-neutral collision. On the other hand,
longer-period (> 5 s) waves do not reach the transition region as they become evanescent at lower
heights in the network cores. Propagation of torsional Alfven waves through the chromosphere into
the solar corona should be considered with caution: low-frequency waves are evanescent due to the
stratification, while high-frequency waves are damped due to ion neutral collisions.
