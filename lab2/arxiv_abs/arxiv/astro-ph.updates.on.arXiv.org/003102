The z=0.89 molecular absorber toward PKS1830-211 provides us with the opportunity to probe the
chemical and physical properties of the interstellar medium in the disk of a galaxy at a look-back
time of half the present age of the Universe. Recent ALMA observations of hydrides have unveiled
the multi-phase composition of this source's interstellar medium along two absorbing sightlines.
Here, we report ALMA observations of CH+ and SH+, and of their 13C- and 34S- isotopologues, as potential
tracers of energetic processes in the interstellar medium. CH+ and 13CH+ are detected toward both
images of PKS1830-211, CH+ showing the deepest and broadest absorption among all species observed
so far. The [CH+]/[13CH+] abundance ratio is ~100 in the south-west line of sight. [...] Toward the
north-east image, we find an even larger value of [CH+]/[13CH+], 146 +/- 43, although with a large
uncertainty. This sightline intercepts the absorber at a larger galactocentric radius than the
southwestern one, where material might be less processed in stellar nucleosynthesis. In contrast
to CH+ and its 13C isotopologue, SH+ and 34SH+ are only detected on the south-west sightline. These
are the first detections of extragalactic SH+ and interstellar 34SH+. The spectroscopic parameters
of SH+ are reevaluated and improved rest frequencies of 34SH+ are obtained. The [CH+]/[SH+] column
density ratios show a large difference between the two lines of sight: ~25 and >600 toward the SW and
NE image, respectively. We are not able to shed light on the formation process of CH+ and SH+ with these
data, but the differences in the two sightlines toward PKS1830-211 suggest that their absorptions
arise from gas with molecular fraction gtrsim 10%, with SH+ tracing significantly higher molecular
fractions than CH+.
