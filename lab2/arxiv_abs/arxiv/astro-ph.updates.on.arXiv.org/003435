We analyze the emission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-12b using our HELIOS-R retrieval code and
HELIOS-K opacity calculator. When interpreting Hubble and Spitzer data, the retrieval outcomes
are found to be prior-dominated. When the prior distributions of the molecular abundances are assumed
to be log-uniform, the volume mixing ratio of HCN is found to be implausibly high. A VULCAN chemical
kinetics model of WASP-12b suggests that chemical equilibrium is a reasonable assumption even
when atmospheric mixing is implausibly rigorous. Guided by (exo)planet formation theory, we set
Gaussian priors on the elemental abundances of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen with the Gaussian peaks
being centered on the measured C/H, O/H and N/H values of the star. By enforcing chemical equilibrium,
we find substellar O/H and stellar to slightly superstellar C/H for the dayside atmosphere of WASP-12b.
The superstellar carbon-to-oxygen ratio is just above unity, regardless of whether clouds are
included in the retrieval analysis, consistent with Madhusudhan et al. (2011). Furthermore, whether
a temperature inversion exists in the atmosphere depends on one's assumption for the Gaussian width
of the priors. Our retrieved posterior distributions are consistent with the formation of WASP-12b
in a solar-composition protoplanetary disk, beyond the water iceline, via gravitational instability
or pebble accretion (without core erosion) and migration inwards to its present orbital location
via a disk-free mechanism, and are inconsistent with both in-situ formation and core accretion
with disk migration, as predicted by Madhusudhan et al. (2017). We predict that the interpretation
of James Webb Space Telescope WASP-12b data will not be prior-dominated.
