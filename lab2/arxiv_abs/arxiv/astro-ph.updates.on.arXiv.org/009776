We use the IllustrisTNG (TNG) simulations to explore the galaxy-halo connection as inferred from
state-of-the-art cosmological, magnetohydrodynamical simulations. With the high mass resolution
and large volume achieved by combining the 100 Mpc (TNG100) and 300 Mpc (TNG300) volumes, we establish
the mean occupancy of central and satellite galaxies and their dependence on the properties of the
dark matter haloes hosting them. We derive best-fitting HOD parameters from TNG100 and TNG300 for
target galaxy number densities of $\bar{n}_g = 0.032\,h^3$Mpc$^{-3}$ and $\bar{n}_g = 0.016\,h^3$Mpc$^{-3}$,
respectively, corresponding to a minimum galaxy stellar mass of $M_\star\sim1.9\times10^9\,{\rm
M}_\odot$ and $M_\star\sim3.5\times10^9\,{\rm M}_\odot$, respectively, in hosts more massive
than $10^{11}\,{\rm M}_\odot$. Consistent with previous work, we find that haloes located in dense
environments, with low concentrations, later formation times, and high angular momenta are richest
in their satellite population. At low mass, highly-concentrated haloes and those located in overdense
regions are more likely to contain a central galaxy. The degree of environmental dependence is sensitive
to the definition adopted for the physical boundary of the host halo. We examine the extent to which
correlations between galaxy occupancy and halo properties are independent and demonstrate that
HODs predicted by halo mass and present-day concentration capture the qualitative dependence
on the remaining halo properties. At fixed halo mass, concentration is a strong predictor of the
stellar mass of the central galaxy, which may play a defining role in the fate of the satellite population.
The radial distribution of satellite galaxies, which exhibits a universal form across a wide range
of host halo mass, is described accurately by the best-fit NFW density profile of their host haloes.
