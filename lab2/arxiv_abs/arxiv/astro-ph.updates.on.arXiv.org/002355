We apply both leptonic and leptohadronic emission scenarios for modelling the multiwavelength
photon spectra and the observed variability in the optical, X-ray, and TeV gamma-ray energy bands
of blazar PKS 2155-304 while being in a low state between 25 August and 6 September 2008. We consider
three emission models, i.e. a one-component synchrotron self-Compton model (1-SSC), a one-zone
proton synchrotron model (LHs), and a two-component SSC model (2-SSC). Only in the first scenario
can the emission from the optical up to TeV gamma-rays be attributed to a single particle population
from one emission region. Using a time-dependent numerical code that solves the kinetic equations
for each particle species, we derived, in all cases, acceptable fits to the time-averaged SED. By
imposing variations to one (or more) model parameters according to observed variability pattern
in one (or more) frequencies we calculated the respective light curves and compared them with the
observations. We show that the 1-SSC model cannot account for the anticorrelation observed between
the X-rays and VHE gamma-rays, although it can explain the time-averaged SED. The anticorrelation
can be more naturally explained by the two-component emission models. Both of them reproduce satisfactorily
the optical, X-ray, and TeV variability but at the cost of additional free parameters, which from
four in the 2-SSC model increase to six in the LHs model. Although the results of our time-resolved
analysis do not favour one of the aforementioned models, they suggest that a two-component scenario
is more adequate for the emission of PKS 2155-304 in the low state of 2008, which agrees with a recent
independent analysis. This suggests that the quiescent blazar radiation might result from a superposition
of the radiation from different components, while a flare might still be the result of a single component.
