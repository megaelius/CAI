We investigate C IV broad absorption line (BAL) variability within a sample of 46 radio-loud quasars
(RLQs), selected from SDSS/FIRST data to include both core-dominated (39) and lobe-dominated
(7) objects. The sample consists primarily of high-ionization BAL quasars, and a substantial fraction
have large BAL velocities or equivalent widths; their radio luminosities and radio-loudness values
span ~2.5 orders of magnitude. We have obtained 34 new Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) spectra of 28
BAL RLQs to compare to earlier SDSS data, and we also incorporate archival coverage (primarily dual-epoch
SDSS) for a total set of 78 pairs of equivalent width measurements for 46 BAL RLQs, probing rest-frame
timescales of ~80-6000 d (median 500 d). In general, only modest changes in the depths of segments
of absorption troughs are observed, akin to those seen in prior studies of BAL RQQs. Also similar
to previous findings for RQQs, the RLQs studied here are more likely to display BAL variability on
longer rest-frame timescales. However, typical values of |Delta_EW| and |Delta_EW|/<EW>
are about 40+/-20% lower for BAL RLQs when compared with those of a timescale-matched sample of BAL
RQQs. Optical continuum variability is of similar amplitude in BAL RLQs and BAL RQQs; for both RLQs
and RQQs, continuum variability tends to be stronger on longer timescales. BAL variability in RLQs
does not obviously depend upon their radio luminosities or radio-loudness values, but we do find
tentative evidence for greater fractional BAL variability within lobe-dominated RLQs. Enhanced
BAL variability within more edge-on (lobe-dominated) RLQs supports some geometrical dependence
to the outflow structure.
