The Cometary Secondary Ion Mass Analyzer (COSIMA) onboard ESA's Rosetta orbiter has revealed that
dust particles in the coma of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko are aggregates of small grains.
We study the morphological, elastic, and electric properties of dust aggregates in the coma of Comet
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko using optical microscopic images taken by the COSIMA instrument.
Dust aggregates in COSIMA images are well represented as fractals in harmony with morphological
data from MIDAS (Micro-Imaging Dust Analysis System) and GIADA (Grain Impact Analyzer and Dust
Accumulator) onboard Rosetta. COSIMA's images, together with the data from the other Rosetta's
instruments such as MIDAS and GIADA do not contradict the so-called rainout growth of $10~\mu\mathrm{m}$-sized
particles in the solar nebula. The elastic and electric properties of dust aggregates measured
by COSIMA suggest that the surface chemistry of cometary dust is well represented as carbonaceous
matter rather than silicates or ices, consistent with the mass spectra, and that organic matter
is to some extent carbonized by solar radiation, as inferred from optical and infrared observations
of various comets. Electrostatic lofting of cometary dust by intense electric fields at the terminator
of its parent comet is unlikely, unless the surface chemistry of the dust changes from a dielectric
to a conductor. Our findings are not in conflict with our current understanding of comet formation
and evolution, which begin with the accumulation of condensates in the solar nebula and follow with
the formation of a dust mantle in the inner solar system.
