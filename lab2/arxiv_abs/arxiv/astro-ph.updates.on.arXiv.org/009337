We report on the global structure of the Milky Way (MW) stellar halo up to its outer boundary based
on the analysis of blue-horizontal branch stars (BHBs). These halo tracers are extracted from the
$(g,r,i,z)$ band multi-photometry in the internal data release of the on-going Hyper Suprime-Cam
Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) surveyed over $\sim550$~deg$^2$ area. In order to select most
likely BHBs by removing blue straggler stars (BSs) and other contamination in a statistically significant
manner, we have developed and applied an extensive Bayesian method, instead of the simple color
cuts adopted in our previous work, where each of the template BHBs and non-BHBs obtained from the
available catalogs is represented as a mixture of multiple Gaussian distributions in the color-color
diagrams. We found from the candidate BHBs in the range of 18.5<g<23.5 mag that the radial density
distribution over a Galactocentric radius of r=36-360 kpc can be approximated as a single power-law
profile with an index of $\alpha=3.74^{+0.21}_{-0.22}$ or a broken power-law profile with an index
of $\alpha_{\rm in}=2.92^{+0.33}_{-0.33}$ at $r$ below a broken radius of $r_{\rm b}=160^{+18}_{-19}$~kpc
and a very steep slope of $\alpha_{\rm out}=15.0^{+3.7}_{-4.5}$ at $r>r_{\rm b}$. The latter profile
with a prolate shape having an axial ratio of $q=1.72^{+0.44}_{-0.28}$ is most likely and this halo
may hold a rather sharp boundary at r=160kpc. The slopes of the halo density profiles are compared
with those from the suite of hydrodynamical simulations for the formation of stellar halos. This
comparison suggests that the MW stellar halo may consist of the two overlapping components: the
in situ. inner halo as probed by RR Lyrae stars showing a relatively steep radial density profile
and the ex situ. outer halo with a shallow profile probed by BHBs here, which is made by accretion of
small stellar systems.
