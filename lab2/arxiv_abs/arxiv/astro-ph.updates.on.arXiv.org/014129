Many low-frequency radio interferometers are aiming to detect very faint spectral signatures
from structures at cosmological redshifts, particularly neutral Hydrogen using its characteristic
21 cm spectral line. Due to the very high dynamic range needed to isolate these faint spectral fluctuations
from the very bright foregrounds, spectral systematics from the instrument or the analysis, rather
than thermal noise, are currently limiting their sensitivity. Failure to achieve a spectral calibration
with fractional inaccuracy $\lesssim 10^{-5}$ will make the detection of the critical cosmic signal
unlikely. The bispectrum phase from interferometric measurements is largely immune to this calibration
issue. We present a basis to explore the nature of bispectrum phase in the limit of small spectral
fluctuations. We establish that they measure the intrinsic dissimilarity in transverse structure
of the cosmic signal relative to the foregrounds, expressed as rotations in the underlying phase
angle. Their magnitude is related to the strength of the cosmic signal relative to the foregrounds.
Using a range of sky models, we detail the behavior of bispectrum phase fluctuations using standard
Fourier-domain techniques and find it comparable to existing approaches, with a few key differences.
Mode-mixed foreground contamination is more pronounced than in existing approaches because the
bispectrum phase is a product of three individual interferometric phases. The multiplicative
coupling of foregrounds in the bispectrum phase fluctuations results in the mixing of foreground
signatures with that of the cosmic signal. We briefly outline a variation of this approach to avoid
extensive mode-mixing. Despite its limitations, the interpretation of results using bispectrum
phase is possible with forward-modeling. Importantly, it is an independent and a viable alternative
to existing approaches.
