We present the first results of the SOAR (Southern Astrophysical Research) Gravitational Arc Survey
(SOGRAS). The survey imaged 47 clusters in two redshift intervals centered at $z=0.27$ and $z=0.55$,
targeting the richest clusters in each interval. Images were obtained in the $g'$, $r'$ and $i'$
bands using the SOAR Optical Imager (SOI), with a median seeing of 0.83, 0.76 and 0.71 arcsec, respectively,
in these filters. Most of the survey clusters are located within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
Stripe 82 region and all of them are in the SDSS footprint. Photometric calibration was therefore
performed using SDSS stars located in our SOI fields. We reached for galaxies in all fields the detection
limits of $g \sim 23.5$, $r \sim 23$ and $i \sim 22.5$ for a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) = 3. As a by-product
of the image processing, we generated a source catalogue with 19760 entries, the vast majority of
which are galaxies, where we list their positions, magnitudes and shape parameters. We compared
our galaxy shape measurements to those of local galaxies and concluded that they were not strongly
affected by seeing. From the catalogue data, we are able to identify a red sequence of galaxies in
most clusters in the lower $z$ range. We found 16 gravitational arc candidates around 8 clusters
in our sample. They tend to be bluer than the central galaxies in the lensing cluster. A preliminary
analysis indicates that $\sim 10%$ of the clusters have arcs around them, with a possible indication
of a larger efficiency associated to the high-$z$ systems when compared to the low-$z$ ones. Deeper
follow-up images with Gemini strengthen the case for the strong lensing nature of the candidates
found in this survey.
