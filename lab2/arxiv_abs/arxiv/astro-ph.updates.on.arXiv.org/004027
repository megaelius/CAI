Estimates of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, from the distance ladder and the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) differ at the $\sim$3-$\sigma$ level, indicating a potential issue with the standard $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology. Interpreting this tension correctly requires a model comparison calculation depending
on not only the traditional `$n$-$\sigma$' mismatch but also the tails of the likelihoods. Determining
the form of the tails of the local $H_0$ likelihood is impossible with the standard Gaussian least-squares
approximation, as it requires using non-Gaussian distributions to faithfully represent anchor
likelihoods and model outliers in the Cepheid and supernova (SN) populations, and simultaneous
fitting of the full distance-ladder dataset to correctly propagate uncertainties. We have developed
a Bayesian hierarchical model that describes the full distance ladder, from nearby geometric anchors
through Cepheids to Hubble-Flow SNe. This model does not rely on any distributions being Gaussian,
allowing outliers to be modeled and obviating the need for arbitrary data cuts. Sampling from the
$\sim$3000-parameter joint posterior using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, we find $H_0$ = (72.72 $\pm$
1.67) ${\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ when applied to the outlier-cleaned Riess et al. (2016) data,
and ($73.15 \pm 1.78$) ${\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ with SN outliers reintroduced. Our high-fidelity
sampling of the low-$H_0$ tail of the distance-ladder likelihood allows us to apply Bayesian model
comparison to assess the evidence for deviation from $\Lambda$CDM. We set up this comparison to
yield a lower limit on the odds of the underlying model being $\Lambda$CDM given the distance-ladder
and Planck XIII (2016) CMB data. The odds against $\Lambda$CDM are at worst 10:1 or 7:1, depending
on whether the SNe outliers are cut or modeled, or 60:1 if an approximation to the Planck Int. XLVI
(2016) likelihood is used.
