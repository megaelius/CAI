The atomic interstellar medium (ISM) is observed to be full of linear structures that are referred
to as "fibers". Fibers exhibit similar properties to linear structures found in molecular clouds
known as striations. Suggestive of a similar formation mechanism, both striations and fibers appear
to be ordered, quasi-periodic, and well-aligned with the magnetic field. The prevailing formation
mechanism for striations involves the excitation of fast magnetosonic waves. Based on this theoretical
model, and through a combination of velocity centroids and column density maps, Tritsis et al. (2018)
developed a method for estimating the plane-of-sky (POS) magnetic field from molecular cloud striations.
We apply this method in two H\textsc{I} clouds with fibers along the same line-of-sight (LOS) towards
the ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray (UHECR) hotspot, at the boundaries of Ursa Major. For the cloud
located closer to Earth, where Zeeman observations from the literature were also available, we
find general agreement in the distributions of the LOS and POS components of the magnetic field.
We find relatively large values for the total magnetic field (ranging from $\sim$$\rm{10}$ to $\sim$$\rm{20}
~\rm{\mu G}$) and an average projection angle with respect to the LOS of $\sim$ 50$^\circ$. For the
cloud located further away, we also find a large value for the POS component of the magnetic field
of $15^{+8}_{-3}~\rm{\mu G}$. We discuss the potential of our new magnetic-field tomography method
for large-scale application. We consider the implications of our findings for the accuracy of current
reconstructions of the Galactic magnetic field and on the propagation of UHECR through the ISM.
