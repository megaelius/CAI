We present a broadband spectral study of the radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy 1H~0323+342
based on multi-epoch observations performed with NuSTAR on 2014 March 15, and two simultaneous
observations performed with Suzaku and Swift on 2009 July 26 and 2013 March 1. We found the presence
of a strong soft X-ray excess emission, a broad but weak Fe line and hard X-ray excess emission. We
used the blurred reflection (relxill) and the intrinsic disc Comptonization (optxagnf), two physically
motivated models, to describe the broadband spectra and to disentangle the disk/corona and jet
emission. The relxill model is mainly constrained by the strong soft X-ray excess although the model
failed to predict this excess when fitted above 3keV and extrapolated to lower energies. The joint
spectral analysis of the three datasets above 3keV with this model resulted in a high black hole spin
($a>0.9$) and moderate reflection fraction $R\sim 0.5$. The optxagnf model fitted to the two simultaneous
datasets resulted in an excess emission in the UV band. The simultaneous UV-to-hard X-ray spectra
of 1H~0323+342 are best described by a model consisting of a primary X-ray power-law continuum with
$\Gamma \sim 1.8$, a blurred reflection component with $R\sim 0.5$, Comptonised disk emission
as the soft X-ray excess, optical/UV emission from a standard accretion disk around a black hole
of mass $\sim 10^7{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and a steep power law ($\Gamma \sim 3-3.5$) component, most likely
the jet emission in the UV band. The fractional RMS variability spectra suggest that both the soft
excess and the powerlaw component are variable in nature.
