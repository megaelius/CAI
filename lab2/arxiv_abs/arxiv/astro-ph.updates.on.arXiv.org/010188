Positions and proper motions of Gaia sources are expressed in a reference frame that ideally should
be non-rotating relative to distant extragalactic objects, coincident with the International
Celestial Reference System (ICRS), and consistent across all magnitudes. For sources fainter
than 16th magnitude this is achieved thanks to Gaia's direct observations of quasars. At brighter
magnitudes it is difficult to validate the quality of the reference frame due to the scarcity of comparison
data. This paper examines the use of VLBI observations of radio stars to determine the spin and orientation
of the bright reference frame of Gaia. Simultaneous estimation of the six spin and orientation parameters
makes optimal use of VLBI data and makes it possible to include even single-epoch VLBI observations
in the solution. The method is applied to Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) using published VLBI data for 41
radio stars. Results for the 26 best-fitting sources indicate that the bright reference frame of
Gaia DR2 is rotating relative to the faint quasars at a rate of about 0.1 mas/yr, significant at 2-sigma
level. This supports a similar conclusion based on a comparison with stellar positions in the Hipparcos
frame. The accuracy is currently limited by the small number of radio sources used, by uncertainties
in the Gaia DR2 proper motions, and by the astrophysical nature of the radio stars. While the origin
of the indicated rotation is understood and can be avoided in future data releases, it remains important
to validate the bright reference frame of Gaia by independent observations. This can be achieved
using VLBI astrometry, which may require re-observing the old sample of radio stars as well as measuring
new objects. The unique historical value of positional measurements is stressed and VLBI observers
are urged to ensure that relevant positional information is preserved for the future.
