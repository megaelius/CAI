We study the effect of baryons on the inner dark matter profile in a large statistical sample of the
first galaxies using the First Billion Years simulation between $z=16-6$. Using two simulations
of the same volume and cosmological initial conditions, one with and one without baryons, we are
able to directly compare haloes with their baryon-free counterparts, allowing a detailed study
of the modifications to the dark matter density profile due to the presence of baryons. For each of
the $\approx 5000$ haloes in our sample, we quantify the impact of the baryons using $\eta$, defined
as the ratio of dark matter mass enclosed in 100 pc in the baryonic run to its counterpart without baryons.
We find there is not one general baryonic impact on the dark matter; many haloes show an enhancement
of dark matter in the halo centre compared to the baryon-free simulation, while many others show
a deficit. We find that the mean value of $\eta$ is close to unity, but there is a large dispersion,
with a standard deviation of $0.677$. The enhancement is cyclical in time and tracks the star formation
cycle of the galaxy; as gas falls to the centre and forms stars, the dark matter moves in as well. Supernova
feedback then removes the gas, and the dark matter again responds to the changing potential. We study
three physical models relating the motion of baryons to that of the dark matter: adiabatic contraction,
dynamical friction, and rapid outflows. Adiabatic contraction and the rapid outflows due to feedback
describe well the enhancement of dark matter. We predict that the cyclical evolution of the central
dark matter profile will end when either the infalling gas reservoir is depleted or when feedback
no longer drives the gas out of the central region of the halo. Abridged, see text for full abstract.
