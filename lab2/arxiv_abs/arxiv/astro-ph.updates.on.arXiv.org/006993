HD 219134 hosts several planets, with seven candidates reported, and the two shortest period planets
are rocky (4-5 $M_{\oplus}$) and transit the star. Here we present contemporaneous multi-wavelength
observations of the star HD 219134. We observed HD 219134 with the Narval spectropolarimeter at
the Observatoire du Pic du Midi, and used Zeeman Doppler Imaging to characterise its large-scale
stellar magnetic field. We found a weak poloidal magnetic field with an average unsigned strength
of 2.5 G. From these data we confidently confirm the rotation period of 42 days, measure a stellar
inclination of 77$\pm$8 degrees, and find evidence for differential rotation. The projected obliquity
of the two transiting super-Earths is therefore between 0 and 20 degrees. We employed HST STIS observations
of the Ly$\alpha$ line to derive a stellar wind mass-loss rate of half the solar value ($10^{-14}
M_{\odot} {\rm yr}^{-1}$). We further collected photometric transit observations of the closest
planet at near-UV wavelengths centred on the Mg II h&k lines with AstroSat. We found no detectable
absorption, setting an upper limit on the transit depth of about 3%, which rules out the presence
of a giant magnesium cloud larger than 9 planet radii. Finally, we estimated the high-energy flux
distribution of HD 219134 as seen by planets b and c. These results present a detailed contemporaneous
characterisation of HD 219134, and provide the ingredients necessary for accurately modelling
the high-energy stellar flux, the stellar wind, and their impact on the two shortest-period planets,
which will be presented in the second paper of this series.
