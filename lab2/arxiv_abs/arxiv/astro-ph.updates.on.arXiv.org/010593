The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been the most impactful science-driven mission ever flown
by NASA. However, when HST reaches the end of its life, there will be a void due to the loss of some of
the science capabilities afforded by HST to astronomers world-wide. The previous 2010 Decadal
Survey (DS) noted this void, arguing for the need for a successor to HST with UV capabilities in three
separate places in the main report (pp. 190, 203, and 220). The large strategic missions that will
follow HST, namely JWST and WFIRST, will continue to spark the interest of the public in space-based
astronomy. In order to ensure continued US preeminence in the arena of large space-based astrophysics
missions, and a seamless transition after WFIRST, a future flagship mission must be waiting in the
wings. Anticipating this need, NASA initiated four large strategic mission concept studies (HabEx,
LUVOIR, Lynx, and Origins), which have mature designs, including detailed technology assessments
and development plans. Two of these concepts, HabEx and LUVOIR, are responsive to the recommendations
of the previous DS regarding a UV-capable mission. Both are more powerful successors to HST, with
UV-to-optical capabilities that range from significant enhancements to orders-of-magnitude
improvement. At the same time, technological and scientific advances over the past decade only
now make it feasible to marry such a mission with one that can search for life outside the solar system.
Acknowledging that the constraints that the Astro2020 DS must consider may be difficult to anticipate,
the HabEx and LUVOIR studies present eleven different variants, each of which enable groundbreaking
science, including the direct imaging and characterization of exoplanets. The HabEx and LUVOIR
mission studies offer a full suite of options to the Astro2020 DS, with corresponding flexibility
in budgeting and phasing.
