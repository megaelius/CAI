The year-long broadband afterglow of GW170817/GRB 170817A is believed to be from an off-axis structured
jet. Since the central engine of a gamma-ray burst usually launches a pair of outflows that move oppositely,
it is reasonable to consider the emission from a double-sided structured jet in the system, with
a preceding outflow moving toward us and a receding outflow moving backwardly. Assuming that the
receding jet has the same physical parameters as those of the preceding jet, we have calculated the
emission from both branches of the jet. It is found that the receding jet component will emerge in
the radio light curves $\sim$ 2500 days post-merger. It typically leads to a plateau in the afterglow
light curve, thus could be hopefully revealed by high accuracy radio observations. We have also
considered the possibilities that the two branches of the jet have different parameters. It is found
that if some of the physical parameters (such as the circum-burst medium density, the energy fractions
of electrons and magnetic fields, the energetics of the outflow, etc.) of the receding jet are evaluated
more favorably than those of the preceding jet, then the receding jet emission will be notably enhanced
and will clearly show up as an obvious plateau or even a rebrightening. For example, when the density
of the circum-burst medium encountered by the receding jet is assumed to be 100 times higher than
that of the preceding jet, a remarkable radio plateau will appear at about 600 days after the merger.
However, in X-ray bands, the receding jet component is generally too faint to be discerned. It is
argued that observations of the late radio afterglow of GW170817/GRB 170817A can help determine
the key parameters and diagnose the environment of the event.
