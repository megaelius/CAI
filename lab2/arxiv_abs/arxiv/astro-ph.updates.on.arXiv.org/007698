Understanding the observations of dynamical tracers and the trajectories of lensed photons at
galactic scales within the context of General Relativity (GR), requires the introduction of a hypothetical
dark matter dominant component. The onset of these gravitational anomalies, where the Schwarzschild
solution no longer describes observations, closely corresponds to regions where accelerations
drop below the characteristic $a_{0}$ acceleration of MOND, which occur at a well established mass-dependent
radial distance, $R_{c}\propto (GM/a_{0})^{1/2}$. At cosmological scales, inferred dynamics
are also inconsistent with GR and the observed distribution of mass. The current accelerated expansion
rate requires the introduction of a hypothetical dark energy dominant component. We here show that
for a Schwarzschild metric at galactic scales, the scalar curvature, K, multiplied by $(r^{4}/M)$
at the critical MOND transition radius, $r=R_{c}$, has an invariant value of $\kappa_{B}=K(r^{4}/M)=28Ga_{0}/c^{4}$.
Further, assuming this condition holds for $r>R_{c}$, is consistent with the full spacetime which
under GR corresponds to a dominant isothermal dark matter halo, to within observational precision
at galactic level. For a FLRW metric, this same constant bounding curvature condition yields for
a spatially flat spacetime a cosmic expansion history which agrees with the $\Lambda$CDM empirical
fit for recent epochs, and which similarly tends asymptotically to a de Sitter solution. Thus, a
simple covariant purely geometric condition identifies the low acceleration regime of observed
gravitational anomalies, and can be used to guide the development of { extended} gravity theories
at both galactic and cosmological scales.
