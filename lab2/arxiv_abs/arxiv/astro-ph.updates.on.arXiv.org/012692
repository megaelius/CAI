Many problems in contemporary astrophysics---from understanding the formation of black holes
to untangling the chemical evolution of galaxies---rely on knowledge about binary stars. This,
in turn, depends on discovery and characterization of binary companions for large numbers of different
kinds of stars in different chemical and dynamical environments. Current stellar spectroscopic
surveys observe hundreds of thousands to millions of stars with (typically) few observational
epochs, which allows binary discovery but makes orbital characterization challenging. We use
a custom Monte Carlo sampler (The Joker) to perform discovery and characterization of binary systems
through radial-velocities, in the regime of sparse, noisy, and poorly sampled multi-epoch data.
We use it to generate posterior samplings in Keplerian parameters for 232,531 sources released
in APOGEE Data Release 16. Our final catalog contains 19,635 high-confidence close-binary (P <
few years, a < few AU) systems that show interesting relationships between binary occurrence rate
and location in the color-magnitude diagram. We find notable faint companions at high masses (black-hole
candidates), at low masses (substellar candidates), and at very close separations (mass-transfer
candidates). We also use the posterior samplings in a (toy) hierarchical inference to measure the
long-period binary-star eccentricity distribution. We release the full set of posterior samplings
for the entire parent sample of 232,531 stars. This set of samplings involves no heuristic "discovery"
threshold and therefore can be used for myriad statistical purposes, including hierarchical inferences
about binary-star populations and sub-threshold searches.
