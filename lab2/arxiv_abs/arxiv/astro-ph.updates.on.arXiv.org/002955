We present the statistical analysis of X-ray surface brightness and gas density fluctuations in
cool cores of ten, nearby and bright galaxy clusters that have deep Chandra observations and show
observational indications of radio-mechanical AGN feedback. Within the central parts of cool
cores the total variance of fluctuations is dominated by isobaric and/or isothermal fluctuations
on spatial scales ~ 10-60 kpc, which are likely associated with slow gas motions and bubbles of relativistic
plasma. Adiabatic fluctuations associated with weak shocks constitute less than 10 per cent of
the total variance in all clusters. The typical amplitude of density fluctuations is small, ~ 10
per cent or less on scales of ~ 10-15 kpc. Subdominant contribution of adiabatic fluctuations and
small amplitude of density fluctuations support a model of gentle AGN feedback as opposed to periodically
explosive scenarios which are implemented in some numerical simulations. Measured one-component
velocities of gas motions are typically below 100-150 km/s on scales < 50 kpc, and can be up to ~ 300
km/s on ~ 100 kpc scales. The non-thermal energy is < 12 per cent of the thermal energy. Regardless
of the source that drives these motions the dissipation of the energy in such motions provides heat
that is sufficient to balance radiative cooling on average, albeit the uncertainties are large.
Presented results here support previous conclusions based on the analysis of the Virgo and Perseus
Clusters, and agree with the Hitomi measurements. With next generation observatories like Athena
and Lynx, these techniques will be yet more powerful.
