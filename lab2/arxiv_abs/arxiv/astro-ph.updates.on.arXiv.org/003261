The 1-50 GHz GBT PRIMOS data contains ~50 molecular absorption lines observed in diffuse and translucent
clouds located in the Galactic Center, Bar, and spiral arms in the line-of-sight to Sgr B2(N). We
measure the column densities and estimate abundances, relative to H2, of 11 molecules and additional
isotopologues. We use absorption by optically thin transitions of c-C3H2 to estimate the N(H2),
and argue that this method is preferable to more commonly used methods. We discuss the kinematic
structure and abundance patterns of small molecules including the sulfur-bearing species CS,
SO, CCS, H2CS, and HCS+; oxygen-bearing molecules OH, SiO, and H2CO; and simple hydrocarbon molecules
c-C3H2, l-C3H, and l-C3H+. We discuss the implications of the observed chemistry for the structure
of the gas and dust in the ISM. Highlighted results include the following. First, whereas gas in the
disk has a molecular hydrogen fraction of 0.65, clouds on the outer edge of the Galactic Bar and in
or near the Galactic Center have molecular fractions of 0.85 and >0.9, respectively. Second, we
observe trends in isotope ratios with Galactocentric distance; while carbon and silicon show enhancement
of the rare isotopes at low Galactocentric distances, sulfur exhibits no trend with Galactocentric
distance; the ratio of c-C3H2/c-H13CCCH provides a good estimate of the 12C:13C ratio, whereas
H2CO/H2^13CO exhibits fractionation. Third, we report the presence of l-C3H+ in diffuse clouds
for the first time. Finally, we suggest that CS has an enhanced abundance within higher density clumps
of material in the disk, and therefore may be diagnostic of cloud conditions. If this holds, the diffuse
clouds in the Galactic disk contain multiple embedded hyperdensities in a clumpy structure, and
the density profile is not a simple function of A_V.
