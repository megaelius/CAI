We investigate evolutionary pathways leading to neutron star formation through the collapse of
oxygen-neon white dwarf (ONe WD) stars in interacting binaries. We consider (1) non-dynamical
mass transfer where an ONe WD approaches the Chandrasekhar mass leading to accretion-induced collapse
(AIC) and (2) dynamical timescale merger-induced collapse (MIC) between an ONe WD and another WD.
We present rates, delay times, and progenitor properties for two different treatments of common
envelope evolution. We show that AIC neutron stars are formed via many different channels and the
most dominant channel depends on the adopted common envelope physics. Most AIC and MIC neutron stars
are born shortly after star formation, though some have delay times >10 Gyr. The shortest delay time
(25-50 Myr) AIC neutron stars have stripped-envelope, compact, helium-burning star donors, though
many prompt AIC neutron stars form via wind-accretion from an asymptotic giant branch star. The
longest delay time AIC neutron stars, which may be observed as young milli-second pulsars among
globular clusters, have a red giant or main sequence donor at the time of NS formation and will eventually
evolve into NS + helium WD binaries. We discuss AIC & MIC binaries as potential gravitational wave
sources for LISA. Neutron stars created via AIC undergo a LMXB phase, offering an electromagnetic
counterpart for those shortest orbital period sources that LISA could identify. The formation
of neutron stars from interacting WDs in binaries is likely to be a key mechanism for the production
of LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave sources (NS-NS and BH-NS mergers) in globular clusters.
