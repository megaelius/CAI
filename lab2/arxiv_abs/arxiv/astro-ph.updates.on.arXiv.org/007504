This research note presents a comparison of radial velocities between the RAVE DR5 data release
with Gaia DR2. RAVE DR5 and Gaia DR2 have 450587 stars in common. In particular we would like to shed
light on a small subset of joint targets (707 stars) that exhibit a constant velocity offset of +105
km/s or -76 km/s, respectively. Overall this comparison confirms the excellent agreement between
those two data sets. The velocity differences can well be matched with two Gaussians with FWHM of
1.2 km/s and 3.6 km/s, respectively. There is a systematic offset of about -0.32 km/s, consistent
with the findings in Gaia DR2, who find an offset of -0.29 km/s. The offset is also comparable to the
offset found between Gaia DR2 and other ground-based spectroscopic surveys in a similar magnitude
range, indicative that the source for this offset may at least partially be related to the radial
velocity zeropoint of Gaia DR2. We identified 707 stars that exhibit large constant velocity offsets.
These cases can be traced to a problem of the reduction pipeline in propagating the wavelength calibration
between neighboring fibres near the edges of the field plate, in particular for observations done
just before fibre repairs, i.e. when live fibres were separated by large gaps of broken ones. In 82\%\
of these cases the offset between RAVE DR5 and Gaia DR2 radial velocity is in the $+105 \pm 15$~\kms
range. These spectra belong to the first 10 fibres of the field plate. Another 3\%\ of the spectra
have velocity offset in the $-76 \pm 4$~\kms range and were observed with the fibres 148-150. Even
though the majority of these 707 stars do not exhibit any particularity in the radial velocity, we
recommend excluding them from future studies.
