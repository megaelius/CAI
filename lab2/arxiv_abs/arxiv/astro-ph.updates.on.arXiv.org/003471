The high-redshift 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen is expected to be observed within the next decade
and will reveal epochs of cosmic evolution that have been previously inaccessible. Due to the lack
of observations, many of the astrophysical processes that took place at early times are poorly constrained.
In recent work we explored the astrophysical parameter space and the resulting large variety of
possible global (sky-averaged) 21-cm signals. Here we extend our analysis to the fluctuations
in the 21-cm signal, accounting for those introduced by density and velocity, Ly$\alpha$ radiation,
X-ray heating, and ionization. While the radiation sources are usually highlighted, we find that
in many cases the density fluctuations play a significant role at intermediate redshifts. Using
both the power spectrum and its slope, we show that properties of high-redshift sources can be extracted
from the observable features of the fluctuation pattern. For instance, the peak amplitude of ionization
fluctuations can be used to estimate whether heating occurred early or late and, in the early case,
to also deduce the cosmic mean ionized fraction at that time. The slope of the power spectrum has a
more universal redshift evolution than the power spectrum itself and can thus be used more easily
as a tracer of high-redshift astrophysics. Its peaks can be used, for example, to estimate the redshift
of the Ly$\alpha$ coupling transition and the redshift of the heating transition (and the mean gas
temperature at that time). We also show that a tight correlation is predicted between features of
the power spectrum and of the global signal, potentially yielding important consistency checks.
