We present VIsible Multi-Object Spectrograph (VIMOS) observations of a z 6 galaxy quintuply imaged
by the Frontier Fields galaxy cluster RXC J2248.7-4431 (z=0.348). This sub-L^*, high-z galaxy
has been recently discovered by Monna et al. (2013) using dropout techniques with the 16-band HST
photometry acquired as part of the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). Obtained
as part of the CLASH-VLT survey, the VIMOS medium-resolution spectra of this source show a very faint
continuum between ~8700A and ~9300A and a prominent emission line at 8643A, which can be readily
identified with Lyman-alpha at z=6.110. The emission line exhibits an asymmetric profile, with
a more pronounced red wing. The rest-frame equivalent width of the line is EW=79+-10A. After correcting
for magnification, the star-formation rate (SFR) estimated from the Lya line is SFR(Lya)=11 M_{sol}/yr
and that estimated from the UV data is SFR(UV)=3 M$_{sol}/yr. We estimate that the effective radius
of the source is R_e<~0.4 kpc, which implies a star formation surface mass density Sigma_{SFR}>6
M$_{sol}/yr/kpc^2 and, using the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, a gas surface mass density Sigma_{gas}>10^3
M$_{sol}/pc^2. Our results support the idea that this magnified, distant galaxy is a young and compact
object with 0.4 L^* at z=6, with comparable amount of mass in gas and stars. Future follow-up observations
with ALMA will provide valuable insight into the SFR and molecular gas content of this source. In
the spirit of the Frontier Fields initiative, we also publish the redshifts of several multiply
imaged sources and other background objects which will help improving the strong lensing model
of this galaxy cluster.
