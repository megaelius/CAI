Species abundances in the interstellar medium (ISM) strongly depend on the chemistry occurring
at the surfaces of the dust grains. To describe the complexity of the chemistry, various numerical
models have been constructed. In most of these models, the grains are described by a single size of
0.1$\mu$m. We study the impact on the abundances of many species observed in the cold cores by considering
several grain sizes in the Nautilus multi-grain model. We used grain sizes with radii in the range
of $0.005\mu$m to $0.25\mu$m. We sampled this range in many bins. We used the previously published,
MRN and WD grain size distributions to calculate the number density of grains in each bin. Other parameters
such as the grain surface temperature or the cosmic-ray-induced desorption rates also vary with
grain sizes. We present the abundances of various molecules in the gas phase and also on the dust surface
at different time intervals during the simulation. We present a comparative study of results obtained
using the single grain and the multi-grain models. We also compare our results with the observed
abundances in TMC-1 and L134N clouds. We show that the grain size, the grain size dependent surface
temperature and the peak surface temperature induced by cosmic ray collisions, play key roles in
determining the ice and the gas phase abundances of various molecules. We also show that the differences
between the MRN and the WD models are crucial for better fitting the observed abundances in different
regions in the ISM. We show that the small grains play a very important role in the enrichment of the
gas phase with the species which are mainly formed on the grain surface, as non-thermal desorption
induced by collisions of cosmic ray particles is very efficient on the small grains.
