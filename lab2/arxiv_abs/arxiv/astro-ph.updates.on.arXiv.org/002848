We have presented 309 new white-dwarf (WD) + main-sequence (MS) star binaries identified from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Tenth Data Release (DR10). The majority of them consist of a white
dwarf and a low-mass secondary (typically M dwarf) companion. The SDSS spectra of the newly found
WDMS binaries with a DA/DB white dwarf and an M/late-K dwarf companion are analyzed based on a spectral
decomposition/fitting method. White dwarf effective temperatures, surface gravities and masses
together with the secondary star spectral types are obtained, and the stellar parameters of DA WDs
with $T_{\rm eff}\la 14,000$ K are revised to the results in the case of 3D model atmosphere. Two independent
distance estimates are derived from the flux-scaling factors between the WDMS SDSS spectra and
the white dwarf and M-dwarf model spectra. It is found that about more than 20 per cent of the newly
found WDMS binaries show a significant discrepancy between the two distance estimates. This might
be caused by the effects of M-dwarf stellar activity or irradiation of the M dwarf companions by the
white dwarf. The stellar parameter distributions are used to investigate the global properties
of newly found WDMS binaries, the results shown in this work are consistent with those derived by
previous investigators. Some WDMS binaries have been observed more than one ($2-4$) times by SDSS,
it is found that four of them exhibit not only Hydrogen emission in all observable Balmer series lines
in addition to He I line Balmer lines but also the rapid variation in the radial velocities of the components
in these binaries. This suggests that they should be the post common envelope binaries (PCEBs) with
a short orbital period. These young PCEBs are very important for limiting the results of common envelope
phase of the binary evolution.
