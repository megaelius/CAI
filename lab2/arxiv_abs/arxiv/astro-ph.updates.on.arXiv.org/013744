We present a statistical weak-lensing magnification analysis on an optically selected sample
of 3029 \texttt{CAMIRA} galaxy clusters with richness $N>15$ at redshift $0.2\leq z <1.1$ in the
Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey. We use two distinct populations of color-selected, flux-limited
background galaxies, namely the low-$z$ and high-$z$ samples at mean redshifts of $\approx1.1$
and $\approx1.4$, respectively, from which to measure the weak-lensing magnification signal
by accounting for cluster contamination as well as masking effects. Our magnification bias measurements
are found to be uncontaminated according to validation tests against the "null-test" samples for
which the net magnification bias is expected to vanish. The magnification bias for the full \texttt{CAMIRA}
sample is detected at a significance level of $9.51\sigma$, which is dominated by the high-$z$ background.
We forward-model the observed magnification data to constrain the normalization of the richness-to-mass
($N$--$M$) relation for the \texttt{CAMIRA} sample with informative priors on other parameters.
The resulting scaling relation is $N\propto {M_{500}}^{0.92\pm0.13} (1 + z)^{-0.48\pm0.69}$,
with a characteristic richness of $N=\left(17.72\pm2.60\right)$ and intrinsic log-normal scatter
of $0.15\pm0.07$ at $M_{500} = 10^{14}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$. With the derived $N$--$M$ relation,
we provide magnification-calibrated mass estimates of individual \texttt{CAMIRA} clusters,
with the typical uncertainty of $\approx39\%$ and $\approx32\%$ at richness$\approx20$ and $\approx40$,
respectively. We further compare our magnification-inferred $N$--$M$ relation with those from
the shear-based results in the literature, finding good agreement.
