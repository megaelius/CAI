Context. Detecting and characterizing substellar companions for which the luminosity, mass,
and age can be determined independently is of utter importance to test and calibrate the evolutionary
models due to uncertainties in their formation mechanisms. HD 19467 is a bright and nearby star hosting
a cool brown dwarf companion detected with RV and imaging, making it a valuable object for such studies.
Aims. We aim to further characterize the orbital, spectral, and physical properties of the HD 19467
system. Methods. We present new high-contrast imaging data with the SPHERE and NaCo instruments.
We also analyze archival data from HARPS, NaCo, HIRES, UVES, and ASAS. We also use proper motion data
of the star from Hipparcos and Gaia. Results. We refine the properties of the host star and derive
an age of 8.0$^{+2.0}_{-1.0}$ Gyr based on isochrones, gyrochronology, and chemical and kinematic
arguments. This estimate is slightly younger than previous estimates of ~9-11 Gyr. No orbital curvature
is seen in the current imaging, RV, and astrometric data. From a joint fit of the data, we refine the
orbital parameters for HD 19467B: period 398$^{+95}_{-93}$ yr, inclination 129.8$^{+8.1}_{-5.1}$
deg, eccentricity 0.56$\pm$0.09, longitude of the ascending node 134.8$\pm$4.5 deg, and argument
of the periastron 64.2$^{+5.5}_{-6.3}$ deg. We assess a dynamical mass of 74$^{+12}_{-9}$ MJ.
The fit with atmospheric models of the spectrophotometric data of HD 19467B indicates an atmosphere
without clouds or with very thin clouds, an effective temperature of 1042$^{+77}_{-71}$ K, and
a large surface gravity of 5.34$^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ dex. The comparison to model predictions of
the bolometric luminosity and dynamical mass of HD 19467B, assuming our system age estimate, indicates
a better agreement with the Burrows et al. models; whereas the other evolutionary models used tend
to underestimate its cooling rate.
