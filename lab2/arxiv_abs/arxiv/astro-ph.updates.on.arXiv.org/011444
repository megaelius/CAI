We analyze the full $\mathit{Kepler}$ phase curve of KOI-964, a binary system consisting of a hot
white dwarf on an eclipsing orbit around an A-type host star. Using all 18 quarters of long-cadence
photometry, we carry out a joint light curve fit and obtain improved phase curve amplitudes, occultation
depths, orbital parameters, and transit ephemeris over the previous results of Carter et al. 2011.
A periodogram of the residuals from the phase curve fit reveals an additional stellar variability
signal from the host star with a characteristic period of $0.620276\pm0.000011$ days and a full
amplitude of $24\pm2$ ppm. We also present new Keck/HIRES radial velocity observations which we
use to measure the orbit and obtain a mass ratio of $q=0.106\pm0.012$. Combining this measurement
with the results of a stellar isochrone analysis, we find that the masses of the host star and white
dwarf companion are $2.23\pm0.12\,M_{\odot}$ and $0.236^{+0.028}_{-0.027}\,M_{\odot}$,
respectively. The effective temperatures of the two components are $9940^{+260}_{-230}$ K and
$15080\pm400$ K, respectively, and we determine the age of the system to be $0.21^{+0.11}_{-0.08}$
Gyr. We use the measured system properties to compute predicted phase curve amplitudes and find
that while the measured Doppler boosting and mutual illumination components agree well with theory,
the ellipsoidal distortion amplitude is significantly underestimated. We detail possible explanations
for this discrepancy, including interactions between the dynamical tide of the host star and the
tidal bulge and possible non-synchronous rotation of the host star.
