We present mid-infrared (MIR) spectra of HII regions within star-forming galaxies M83 and M33.
Their emission features are compared with Galactic and extragalactic HII regions, HII-type galaxies,
starburst galaxies, and Seyfert/LINER type galaxies. Our main results are as follows: (i) the M33
and M83 HII regions lie in between Seyfert/LINER galaxies and HII-type galaxies in the 7.7/11.3
- 6.2/11.3 plane, while the different sub-samples exhibiting different 7.7/6.2 ratios; (ii) Using
the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic database, we demonstrate that the 6.2/7.7 ratio does not effectively
track PAH size, but the 11.3/3.3 PAH ratio does; (iii) variations on the 17 $\mu$m PAH band depends
on object type; however, there is no dependence on metallicity for both extragalactic HII regions
and galaxies; (iv) the PAH/VSG intensity ratio decreases with the hardness of the radiation field
and galactocentric radius (Rg), yet the ionization alone cannot account for the variation seen
in all of our sources; (v) the relative strength of PAH features does not change significantly with
increasing radiation hardness, as measured through the [NeIII]/[NeII] ratio and the ionization
index; (vi) We present PAH SFR calibrations based on the tight correlation between the 6.2, 7.7,
and 11.3 $\mu$m PAH luminosities with the 24 $\mu$m luminosity and the combination of the 24 $\mu$m
and H$\alpha$ luminosity; (vii) Based on the total luminosity from PAH and FIR emission, we argue
that extragalactic HII regions are more suitable templates in modeling and interpreting the large
scale properties of galaxies compared to Galactic HII regions.
