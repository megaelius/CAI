Over the past 5 years, radial-velocity and transit techniques have revealed a new population of
Earth-like planets down to a few Earth masses. Their very close orbit around their host star requires
exquisite inner working angle to be detected in direct imaging and sets a challenge for visible direct
imager like SPHERE / ZIMPOL. Among all known exoplanets having less than twenty-five Earth-masses
we first predict the best candidate for direct imaging. Our primary objective is then to provide
the best instrument setup and observing strategy to detect such a peculiar object with ZIMPOL. Secondly
we aim at predicting its detectivity. Using exoplanet properties constrained by their radial velocity
measurements, polarimetric models and the diffraction propagation code CAOS we build estimates
of the detection sensitivity of ZIMPOL for such a planet in different observing instrument modes.
We show how observing strategies can be optimized to yield the best detection performance on a specific
target. In our current knowledge of exoplanetary systems, alpha Centauri B b is the most promising
target having less than twenty-five Earth-masses for ZIMPOL. With a gaseous Rayleigh-scattering
atmosphere and favorable inclinations, the planet could be detected in about 4 hours observing
time, using the four-quadrant phase mask coronograph in the I band. However, if it displays unfavorable
polarimetric and reflective properties similar to that of our Moon, it is around 50 times fainter
than ZIMPOL best sensitivity. alpha Centauri B is a primary target for SPHERE. Dedicated deep observations
targeting specifically the RV-detected planet can in favorable polarimetric properties of the
planet lead to a detection.
