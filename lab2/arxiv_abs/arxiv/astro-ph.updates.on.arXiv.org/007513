Aims: We systematically explore a plausible subset of the parameter space involving effective
temperatures and metallicities of the ionizing stellar sources, the effects of the hardening of
their radiation by surrounding leaky HII regions with different escape fractions, as well as different
scenarios for the clumpiness of the DIG, and compute the resulting line strength ratios for a number
of diagnostic optical emission lines. Methods: For the ionizing fluxes we compute a grid of stellar
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from detailed, fully non-LTE model atmospheres that include
the effects of stellar winds and line blocking and blanketing. To calculate the ionization and temperature
structure in the HII regions and the diffuse ionized gas we use spherically symmetric photoionization
models as well as state-of-the-art three-dimensional (3D) non-LTE radiative transfer simulations,
considering hydrogen, helium, and the most abundant metals. Results: We provide quantitative
predictions of how the line ratios from HII regions and the DIG vary as a function of metallicity,
stellar effective temperature, and escape fraction from the HII region. The range of predicted
line ratios reinforces the hypothesis that the DIG is ionized by (filtered) radiation from hot stars;
however, comparison of observed and predicted line ratios indicates that the DIG is typically ionized
with a softer SED than predicted by the chosen stellar population synthesis model. Even small changes
in simulation parameters like the clumping factor can lead to considerable variation in the ionized
volume. Both for a more homogeneous gas and a very inhomogeneous gas containing both dense clumps
and channels with low gas density, the ionized region in the dilute gas above the galactic plane can
cease to be radiation-bounded, allowing the ionizing radiation to leak into the intergalactic
medium.
