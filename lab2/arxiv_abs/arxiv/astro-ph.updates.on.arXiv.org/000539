Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs, 10^2-10^5 M_sun) fill the gap between stellar-mass black
holes and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Simulations have shown that IMBHs may form in dense
star clusters, and therefore may still be present in these smaller stellar systems. We investigate
the Galactic globular cluster NGC 5286 for indications of a central IMBH using spectroscopic data
from VLT/FLAMES, velocity measurements from the Rutgers Fabry Perot at CTIO, and photometric data
from HST. We run analytic spherical and axisymmetric Jeans models with different central black-hole
masses, anisotropy, mass-to-light ratio, and inclination. Further, we compare the data to a grid
of N-body simulations without tidal field. Additionally, we use one N-body simulation to check
the results of the spherical Jeans models for the total cluster mass. Both the Jeans models and the
N-body simulations favor the presence of a central black hole in NGC 5286 and our detection is at the
1- to 1.5-sigma level. From the spherical Jeans models we obtain a best fit with black-hole mass M_BH=(1.5+-1.0)x10^3
M_sun. The error is the 68% confidence limit from Monte Carlo simulations. Axisymmetric models
give a consistent result. The best fitting N-body model is found with a black hole of 0.9% of the total
cluster mass (4.38+-0.18)x10^5 M_sun, which results in an IMBH mass of M_BH=(3.9+-2.0)x10^3 M_sun.
Jeans models give lower values for the total cluster mass. Our test of the Jeans models with N-body
simulation data shows that this discrepancy has two reasons: The influence of a radially varying
M/L profile, and underestimation of the velocity dispersion as the measurements are limited to
bright stars. We conclude that detection of IMBHs in Galactic globular clusters remains a challenging
task unless their mass fractions are above those found for SMBHs in nearby galaxies. [abridged]
