Transition region (TR) spectra typically show the Si IV 1402.8 A line to be enhanced by a factor of
5 or more compared to the neighboring O IV 1401.2 A, contrary to predictions of ionization equilibrium
models and the Maxwellian distribution of particle energies. Non-equilibrium effects in TR spectra
are therefore expected. To investigate the combination of non-equilibrium ionization and high-energy
particles, we apply the model of the periodic electron beam, represented by a kappa-distribution
that recurs at periods of several seconds, to plasma at chromospheric temperatures of 10^4 K. This
simple model can approximate a burst of energy release involving accelerated particles. Instantaneous
time-dependent charge states of silicon and oxygen were calculated and used to synthesize the instantaneous
and period-averaged spectra of Si IV and O IV. The electron beam drives the plasma out of equilibrium.
At electron densities of N_e = 10^10 cm^-3, the plasma is out of ionization equilibrium at all times
in all cases we considered, while for a higher density of N_e = 10^11 cm^-3, ionization equilibrium
can be reached toward the end of each period, depending on the conditions. In turn, the character
of the period-averaged synthetic spectra also depends on the properties of the beam. While the case
of kappa = 2 results in spectra with strong or even dominant O IV, higher values of kappa can approximate
a range of observed TR spectra. Spectra similar to typically observed spectra, with the Si IV 1402.8
A line about a factor 5 higher than O IV 1401.2 A, are obtained for kappa = 3. An even higher value of kappa
= 5 results in spectra that are exclusively dominated by Si IV, with negligible O IV emission. This
is a possible interpretation of the TR spectra of UV bursts, although an interpretation that requires
a density that is 1-3 orders of magnitude lower than for equilibrium estimates.
