In strongly magnetized astrophysical plasma systems, magnetic reconnection is believed to be
the primary process during which explosive energy release and particle acceleration occur, leading
to significant high-energy emission. Past years have seen active development of kinetic modeling
of relativistic magnetic reconnection, supporting this magnetically dominated scenario. A much
less explored issue in studies of relativistic reconnection is the consequence of three-dimensional
dynamics, where turbulent structures are naturally generated as various types of instabilities
develop. This paper presents a series of large-scale, three-dimensional, fully-kinetic simulations
of relativistic turbulent magnetic reconnection (RTMR) in positron-electron plasmas. Our simulations
start from a force-free current sheet with several different modes of long wavelength magnetic
field perturbations, which drive additional turbulence in the reconnection region. Because of
this, the current layer breaks up and the reconnection region quickly evolves into a turbulent layer
filled with coherent structures such as flux ropes and current sheets. We find that plasma dynamics
in RTMR is vastly different from their 2D counterparts in many aspects. The flux ropes evolve rapidly
after their generation, and can be completely disrupted due to the secondary kink instability.
Meanwhile, nonthermal particle acceleration and energy-release time scale can be very fast and
robust. The main acceleration mechanism is a Fermi-like acceleration process supported by the
motional electric field, whereas the non-ideal electric field acceleration plays a subdominant
role. We also discuss possible observational implications of three-dimensional RTMR.
