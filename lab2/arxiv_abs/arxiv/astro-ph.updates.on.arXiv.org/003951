We demonstrate that deep good-seeing VLT/HAWK-I $K_\mathrm{s}$ images complemented with $g$+$z$-band
photometry can yield a sensitivity for weak lensing studies of massive galaxy clusters at redshifts
$0.7\lesssim z \lesssim 1.1$ that is almost identical to the sensitivity of HST/ACS mosaics of single-orbit
depth. Key reasons for this good performance are the excellent image quality frequently achievable
for $K_\mathrm{s}$ imaging from the ground, a highly effective photometric selection of background
galaxies, and a galaxy ellipticity dispersion that is noticeably lower than for optically observed
high-redshift galaxy samples. Incorporating results from 3D-HST and UltraVISTA we also obtain
a more accurate calibration of the source redshift distribution than previously achieved for similar
optical weak lensing data sets. Here we study the extremely massive galaxy cluster RCS2$J$232727.7$-$020437
($z=0.699$), combining deep VLT/HAWK-I $K_\mathrm{s}$ images (PSF $\mathrm{FWHM}=0.35^{\prime\prime}$)
with LBT/LBC photometry. The resulting weak lensing mass reconstruction suggests that the cluster
consists of a single overdensity, which is detected with a peak significance of $10.1\sigma$. We
constrain the cluster mass to $M_\mathrm{200c}/(10^{15} \mathrm{M}_\odot) =2.06^{+0.28}_{-0.26}(\mathrm{stat.})\pm
0.12 (\mathrm{sys.})$ assuming a spherical NFW model and simulation-based priors on the concentration,
making it one of the most massive galaxy clusters known in the $z\gtrsim 0.7$ Universe. We also cross-check
the HAWK-I measurements through an analysis of overlapping HST/ACS images, yielding fully consistent
estimates of the lensing signal.
