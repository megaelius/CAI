The diffuse soft X-ray emissivity from galactic winds is computed during the Epoch of Reionization
(EoR). We consider two analytic models, a pressure-driven wind and a superbubble model, and a 3D
cosmological simulation including gas dynamics from the First Billion Years (FiBY) project. The
analytic models are normalized to match the diffuse X-ray emissivity of star-forming galaxies
in the nearby Universe. The cosmological simulation uses physically motivated star formation
and wind prescriptions, and includes radiative transfer corrections. The models and the simulation
all are found to produce sufficient heating of the Intergalactic Medium to be detectable by current
and planned radio facilities through 21 cm measurements during the EoR. While the analytic models
predict a 21 cm emission signal relative to the Cosmic Microwave Background sets in by $z_{\rm trans}
\simeq 8 - 10$, the predicted signal in the FiBY simulation remains in absorption until reionization
completes. The 21 cm absorption differential brightness temperature reaches a minimum of $\Delta
T \simeq -130$ to $-200$ mK, depending on model. Allowing for additional heat from high mass X-ray
binaries pushes the transition to emission to $z_{\rm trans} \simeq 10 - 12$, with shallower absorption
signatures having a minimum of $\Delta T \simeq -110$ to $-140$ mK. The 21 cm signal may be a means of
distinguishing between the wind models, with the superbubble model favouring earlier reheating.
While an early transition to emission may indicate X-ray binaries dominate the reheating, a transition
to emission as early as $z_{\rm trans} > 12$ would suggest the presence of additional heat sources.
