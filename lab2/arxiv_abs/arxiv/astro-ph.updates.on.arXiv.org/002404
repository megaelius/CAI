The measurement of gamma-ray lines from the decay chain of 56Ni provides unique information about
the explosion in supernovae. The 56Ni freshly-produced in the supernova powers the optical light
curve, as it emits gamma-rays upon its radioactive decay to 56Co and then 56Fe. Gamma-ray lines from
56Co decay are expected to become directly visible through the overlying white dwarf material several
weeks after the explosion, as they progressively penetrate the overlying material of the supernova
envelope, diluted as it expands. The lines are expected to be Doppler-shifted or broadened from
the kinematics of the 56Ni ejecta. With the SPI spectrometer on INTEGRAL and using an improved instrumental
background method, we detect the two main lines from 56Co decay at 847 and 1238 keV from SN2014J at
3.3 Mpc, significantly Doppler-broadened, and at intensities (3.65+/-1.21)~10^-4 and (2.27+/-0.69)~10^-4
ph~cm^-2s^-1, respectively, at brightness maximum. We measure their rise towards a maximum after
about 60-100 days and decline thereafter. The intensity ratio of the two lines is found consistent
with expectations from 56Co decay (0.62+/-0.28 at brightness maximum, expected is 0.68). We find
that the broad lines seen in the late, gamma-ray transparent phase are not representative for the
early gamma-ray emission, and rather notice the emission spectrum to be complex and irregular until
the supernova is fully transparent to gamma-rays, with progressive uncovering of the bulk of 56Ni.
We infer that the explosion morphology is not spherically symmetric, both in the distribution of
56Ni and of the unburnt material which occults the 56Co emission. Comparing light curves from different
plausible models, the resulting 56Ni mass is determined as 0.49+/-0.09 M_sol.
