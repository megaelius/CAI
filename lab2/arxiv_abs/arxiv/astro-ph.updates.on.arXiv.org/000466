We present a new model of the extragalactic background light (EBL) and corresponding gamma-gamma
opacity for intergalactic gamma-ray absorption from z = 0 up to z = 10, based on a semi-analytical
model of hierarchical galaxy formation that reproduces key observed properties of galaxies at
various redshifts. Including the potential contribution from Population III stars and following
the cosmic reionization history in a simplified way, the model is also broadly consistent with available
data concerning reionization, particularly the Thomson scattering optical depth constraints
from WMAP. In comparison with previous EBL studies up to z ~ 3-5, our predicted gamma-gamma opacity
is in general agreement for observed gamma-ray energy below 400/(1 + z) GeV, whereas it is a factor
of ~ 2 lower above this energy because of a correspondingly lower cosmic star formation rate, even
though the observed UV luminosity is well reproduced by virtue of our improved treatment of dust
obscuration and direct estimation of star formation rate. The horizon energy at which the gamma-ray
opacity is unity does not evolve strongly beyond z ~ 4 and approaches ~ 20 GeV. The contribution of
Population III stars is a minor fraction of the EBL at z = 0, and is also difficult to distinguish through
gamma-ray absorption in high-z objects, even at the highest levels allowed by the WMAP constraints.
Nevertheless, the attenuation due to Population II stars should be observable in high-z gamma-ray
sources by telescopes such as Fermi or CTA and provide a valuable probe of the evolving EBL in the rest-frame
UV. The detailed results of our model are publicly available in numerical form at the URL this http
