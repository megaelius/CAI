The intermediate-mass pre-main sequence Herbig Ae/Be stars are key to understanding the differences
in formation mechanisms between low- and high-mass stars. The study of the general properties of
these objects is hampered by the fact that few and mostly serendipitously discovered sources are
known. Our goal is to identify new Herbig Ae/Be candidates to create a homogeneous and well defined
catalogue of these objects. We have applied machine learning techniques to 4,150,983 sources with
data from Gaia DR2, 2MASS, WISE, and IPHAS or VPHAS+. Several observables were chosen to identify
new Herbig Ae/Be candidates based on our current knowledge of this class, which is characterised
by infrared excesses, photometric variabilities, and H$\alpha$ emission lines. Classical techniques
are not efficient for identifying new Herbig Ae/Be stars mainly because of their similarity with
classical Be stars, with which they share many characteristics. By focusing on disentangling these
two types of objects, our algorithm has also identified new classical Be stars. We have obtained
a large catalogue of 8470 new pre-main sequence candidates and another catalogue of 693 new classical
Be candidates with a completeness of $78.8\pm1.4\%$ and $85.5\pm1.2\%$, respectively. Of the
catalogue of pre-main sequence candidates, at least 1361 sources are potentially new Herbig Ae/Be
candidates according to their position in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. In this study we present
the methodology used, evaluate the quality of the catalogues, and perform an analysis of their flaws
and biases. For this assessment, we make use of observables that have not been accounted for by the
algorithm and hence are selection-independent, such as coordinates and parallax based distances.
The catalogue of new Herbig Ae/Be stars that we present here increases the number of known objects
of the class by an order of magnitude.
