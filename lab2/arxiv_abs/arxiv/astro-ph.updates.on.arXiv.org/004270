Using high-resolution (sub-kiloparsec scale) submillimeter data obtained by ALMA, we analyze
the star formation rate (SFR), gas content and kinematics in SDP 81, a gravitationally-lensed star-forming
galaxy at redshift $3$. We estimate the SFR surface density ($\sigmasfr$) in the brightest clump
of this galaxy to be $357^{+113}_{-85}\,\sfrunits$, over an area of $0.07\pm0.02\,\kpc^2$. Using
the intensity-weighted velocity of CO$\,$(5-4), we measure the turbulent velocity dispersion
in the plane-of-the-sky and find $\sigma_{\mathrm{v,turb}} = 37\pm5\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$
for the star-forming clump, in good agreement with previous estimates along the line of sight. Our
measurements of gas surface density, freefall time and turbulent Mach number allow us to compare
the theoretical SFR from various star formation models with that observed, revealing that the role
of turbulence is vital to explaining the observed SFR in this clump. While the Kennicutt Schmidt
(KS) relation predicts a SFR surface density of $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR,KS}} = 52\pm17\,\sfrunits$,
the single-freefall model by Krumholz, Dekel and McKee (KDM) predicts $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR,KDM}}
= 106\pm37\,\sfrunits$. In contrast, the multi-freefall (turbulence) model by Salim, Federrath
and Kewley (SFK) gives $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR,SFK}} = 468\pm169\,\sfrunits$. Although the SFK
relation overestimates the SFR in this clump (possibly due to the ignorance of magnetic field),
it provides the best prediction among the available models. Finally, we compare the star formation
and gas properties of this high-redshift galaxy to local star-forming regions and find that the
SFK relation provides the best estimates of SFR in both local and high-redshift galaxies, with a
reduced Chi-squared scatter of $\chi^2_{\mathrm{red}} = 1.2$ as compared to $\chi^2_{\mathrm{red}}
= 50$ and $7.3$ for the KS and KDM relations, respectively.
