ALMA surveys have shown that CO emission in protoplanetary disks is much fainter than expected.
Accordingly, CO-based gas masses and gas/dust ratios are orders of magnitude lower than previously
thought. This may be explained either as fast gas dispersal, or as chemical evolution and locking
up of volatiles in larger bodies leading to the low observed CO fluxes. The latter processes lead
to enhanced C/O ratios in the gas, which may be reflected in enhanced abundances of molecules like
C2H. The goal of this work is to employ C2H observations to understand whether low CO fluxes are caused
by volatile depletion, or by fast gas dissipation. We present ALMA Cycle 4 C2H observations of a subsample
of nine sources in Lupus. The integrated C2H emission is determined and compared to previous CO observations
and model predictions. Seven out of nine disks are detected in C2H, whose line emission is almost
as bright as 13CO. All detections are significantly brighter than the typical sensitivity of the
observations, hinting at a bimodal distribution of the C2H line intensities. When compared with
DALI models, the observed C2H fluxes can be reproduced only if some level of volatile carbon and oxygen
depletion is allowed and C/O>1 in the gas. Models with reduced gas/dust ratios fail instead to reproduce
the observations. A steeper than linear correlation between C2H and CN emission line is found. This
is linked to the fact that C2H emission lines are affected more strongly by C/O variations than CN
lines. Ring-like structures are detected both in C2H and in continuum emission but, as for CN, they
do not seem to be connected. Sz 71 shows ring shaped emission in both C2H and CN with the location of
the peak intensity coinciding. Our new ALMA C2H observations favour volatile carbon and oxygen
depletion rather than fast gas dispersal to explain the faint CO observations for most of the disks.
