Context. Velocity or intensity swirls have now been shown to be widely present throughout the photosphere
and chromosphere. It has been suggested that these events could contribute to the heating of the
upper solar atmosphere, via exciting Alfv\'en pulses, which could carry significant amounts of
energy. However, the conjectured necessary physical conditions for their excitation, that the
magnetic field rotates co-spatially and co-temporally with the velocity field, has not been verified.
Aims. We aim to understand whether photospheric velocity swirls exist co-spatially and co-temporally
with photospheric magnetic swirls, in order to demonstrate the link between swirls and pulses.
Methods. The automated swirl detection algorithm (ASDA) is applied to the photospheric horizontal
velocity and vertical magnetic fields obtained from a series of realistic numerical simulations
using the RMHD code Bifrost. The spatial relationship between the detected velocity and magnetic
swirls is further investigated via a well-defined correlation index (CI) study. Results. On average,
there are ~63 short-lived photospheric velocity swirls (with lifetimes mostly less than 20 s, and
average radius of ~37 km and rotating speeds of ~2.5 km/s) detected in a field of view (FOV) of 6\times6
Mm^{-2}, implying a total population of velocity swirls of ~1.06\times10^7 in the solar photosphere.
More than 80% of the detected velocity swirls are found to be accompanied by local magnetic concentrations
in intergranular lanes. On average, ~71% of the detected velocity swirls have been found to co-exist
with photospheric magnetic swirls with the same rotating direction. Conclusions. The co-temporal
and co-spatial rotation in the photospheric velocity and magnetic fields provide evidence that
the conjectured condition for the excitation of Alfv\'en pulses by photospheric swirls is fulfilled.
