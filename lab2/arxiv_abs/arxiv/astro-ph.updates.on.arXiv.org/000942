We report follow-up observations of 477 program Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) using nine telescopes
of the EURONEAR network having apertures between 0.3 and 4.2 m. Adding these NEAs to our previous
results we now count 739 program NEAs followed-up by the EURONEAR network since 2006. The targets
were selected using EURONEAR planning tools focusing on high priority objects. Analyzing the resulting
orbital improvements suggests astrometric follow-up is most important days to weeks after discovery,
with recovery at a new opposition also valuable. Additionally we observed 40 survey fields spanning
three nights covering 11 sq. degrees near opposition, using the Wide Field Camera on the 2.5m Isaac
Newton Telescope (INT), resulting in 104 discovered main belt asteroids (MBAs) and another 626
unknown one-night objects. These fields, plus program NEA fields from the INT and from the wide field
MOSAIC II camera on the Blanco 4m telescope, generated around 12,000 observations of 2,000 minor
planets (mostly MBAs) observed in 34 square degrees. We identify Near Earth Object (NEO) candidates
among the unknown (single night) objects using three selection criteria. Testing these criteria
on the (known) program NEAs shows the best selection methods are our epsilon-miu model which checks
solar elongation and sky motion and the MPC's NEO rating tool. Our new data show that on average 0.5
NEO candidates per square degree should be observable in a 2m-class survey (in agreement with past
results), while an average of 2.7 NEO candidates per square degree should be observable in a 4m-class
survey (although our Blanco statistics were affected by clouds). At opposition just over 100 MBAs
(1.6 unknown to every 1 known) per square degree are detectable to R=22 in a 2m survey based on the INT
data, while our two best ecliptic Blanco fields away from opposition lead to 135 MBAs (2 unknown to
every 1 known) to R=23.
