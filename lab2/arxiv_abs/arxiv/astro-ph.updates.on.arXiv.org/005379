We describe an implementation of a particle physics module available for the PLUTO code, appropriate
for the dynamical evolution of a plasma consisting of a thermal fluid and a non-thermal component
represented by relativistic charged particles, or cosmic rays (CR). While the fluid is approached
using standard numerical schemes for magnetohydrodynamics, CR particles are treated kinetically
using conventional Particle-In-Cell (PIC) techniques. The module can be used to describe either
test particles motion in the fluid electromagnetic field or to solve the fully coupled MHD-PIC system
of equations with particle backreaction on the fluid as originally introduced by \cite{Bai_etal.2015}.
Particle backreaction on the fluid is included in the form of momentum-energy feedback and by introducing
the CR-induced Hall term in Ohm's law. The hybrid MHD-PIC module can be employed to study CR kinetic
effects on scales larger than the (ion) skin depth provided the Larmor gyration scale is properly
resolved. When applicable, this formulation avoids to resolve microscopic scales offering a substantial
computational saving with respect to PIC simulations. We present a fully-conservative formulation
which is second-order accurate in time and space and extends to either Runge-Kutta (RK) or corner-transport-upwind
(CTU) time-stepping schemes (for the fluid) while a standard Boris integrator is employed for the
particles. For highly-energetic relativistic CRs and in order to overcome the time step restriction
a novel sub-cycling strategy that retains second-order accuracy in time is presented. Numerical
benchmarks and applications including Bell instability, diffusive shock acceleration and test
particle acceleration in reconnecting layers are discussed.
