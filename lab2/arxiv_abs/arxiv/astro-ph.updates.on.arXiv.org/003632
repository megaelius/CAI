I present a simple phenomenological model for the observed linear scaling of the stellar mass in
old globular clusters (GCs) with $z=0$ halo mass in which the stellar mass in GCs scales linearly
with progenitor halo mass at $z=6$ above a minimum halo mass for GC formation. This model reproduces
the observed $M_{\rm GCs}-M_{\rm halo}$ relation at $z=0$ and results in a prediction for the minimum
halo mass at $z=6$ required for hosting one GC: $M_{\rm min}(z=6)=1.07 \times 10^9\,M_{\odot}$.
Translated to $z=0$, the mean threshold mass is $M_{\rm halo}(z=0) \approx 2\times 10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$.
I explore the observability of GCs in the reionization era and their contribution to cosmic reionization,
both of which depend sensitively on the (unknown) ratio of GC birth mass to present-day stellar mass,
$\xi$. Based on current detections of $z \gtrsim 6$ objects with $M_{1500} < -17$, values of $\xi
> 10$ are strongly disfavored; this, in turn, has potentially important implications for GC formation
scenarios. Even for low values of $\xi$, some observed high-$z$ galaxies may actually be GCs, complicating
estimates of reionization-era galaxy ultraviolet luminosity functions and constraints on dark
matter models. GCs are likely important reionization sources if $5 \lesssim \xi \lesssim 10$. I
also explore predictions for the fraction of accreted versus in situ GCs in the local Universe and
for descendants of systems at the halo mass threshold of GC formation (dwarf galaxies). An appealing
feature of the model presented here is the ability to make predictions for GC properties based solely
on dark matter halo merger trees.
