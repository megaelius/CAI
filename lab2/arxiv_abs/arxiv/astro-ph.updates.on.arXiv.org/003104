The effect of metallicity on the granulation activity in stars is still poorly understood. Available
spectroscopic parameters from the updated APOGEE-\textit{Kepler} catalog, coupled with high-precision
photometric observations from NASA's \textit{Kepler} mission spanning more than four years of
observation, make oscillating red giant stars in open clusters crucial testbeds. We determine
the role of metallicity on the stellar granulation activity by discriminating its effect from that
of different stellar properties such as surface gravity, mass, and temperature. We analyze 60 known
red giant stars belonging to the open clusters NGC 6791, NGC 6819, and NGC 6811, spanning a metallicity
range from [Fe/H] $\simeq -0.09$ to $0.32$. The parameters describing the granulation activity
of these stars and their $\nu_\mathrm{max}$, are studied by considering the different masses,
metallicities, and stellar evolutionary stages. We derive new scaling relations for the granulation
activity, re-calibrate existing ones, and identify the best scaling relations from the available
set of observations. We adopted the Bayesian code DIAMONDS for the analysis of the background signal
in the Fourier spectra of the stars. We performed a Bayesian parameter estimation and model comparison
to test the different model hypotheses proposed in this work and in the literature. Metallicity
causes a statistically significant change in the amplitude of the granulation activity, with a
dependency stronger than that induced by both stellar mass and surface gravity. We also find that
the metallicity has a significant impact on the corresponding time scales of the phenomenon. The
effect of metallicity on the time scale is stronger than that of mass. A higher metallicity increases
the amplitude of granulation and meso-granulation signals and slows down their characteristic
time scales toward longer periods.
