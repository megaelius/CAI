Although sunspots have been systematically observed on the Sun's surface over the last four centuries,
their magnetic properties have been revealed and documented only since the early 1900s. Sunspots
typically appear in pairs of opposite magnetic polarities which have a systematic orientation.
This polarity orientation is opposite across the equator -- a trend that has persisted over the last
century over which magnetic field observations exist. Taken together with the configuration of
the global poloidal field of the Sun -- that governs the heliospheric open flux and cosmic ray flux
at Earth -- this phenomenon is consistent with the dipolar parity state of an underlying magnetohydrodynamic
dynamo. Although hemispheric asymmetry in the emergence of sunspots is observed in the Sun, a parity
shift has never been observed. We simulate hemispheric asymmetry through the introduction of random
fluctuations in a computational dynamo model of the solar cycle and demonstrate that changes in
parity are indeed possible in long-term simulations covering thousands of years. Quadrupolar
modes are found to exist over a significant fraction of the simulated time. In particular, we find
that a parity shift in the underlying nature of the sunspot cycle is more likely to occur when sunspot
activity dominates in any one hemisphere for a time which is significantly longer than the cycle
period. We establish causal pathways connecting hemispheric asymmetry and cross-equatorial
phase-shifts to parity flips in the underlying dynamo mechanism. Our findings indicate that the
solar cycle may have resided in quadrupolar parity states in the distant past, and provides a possible
pathway for predicting parity flips in the future.
