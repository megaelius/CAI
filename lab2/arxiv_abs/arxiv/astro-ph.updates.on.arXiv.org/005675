Since their discovery by SDO/AIA in EUV, rapid (phase speeds of 1000 km/s), quasi-periodic, fast-mode
propagating wave trains (QFPs) have been observed accompanying many solar flares. They typically
propagate in funnel-like structures associated with the expanding magnetic field topology of
the active regions (ARs). The waves provide information on the associated flare pulsations and
the magnetic structure through coronal seismology. The reported waves usually originate from
a single localized source associated with the flare. Here, we report the first detection of counter-propagating
QFPs associated with two neighboring flares on 2013 May 22, apparently connected by large-scale,
trans-equatorial coronal loops. We present the first results of 3D MHD model of counter-propagating
QFPs an idealized bi-polar AR. We investigate the excitation, propagation, nonlinearity, and
interaction of the counter-propagating waves for a range of key model parameters, such as the properties
of the sources and the background magnetic structure. In addition to QFPs, we also find evidence
of trapped fast (kink) and slow mode waves associated with the event. We apply coronal seismology
to determine the magnetic field strength in an oscillating loop during the event. Our model results
are in qualitative agreement with the AIA-observed counter propagating waves and are used to identify
the various MHD wave modes associated with the observed event providing insights into their linear
and nonlinear interactions. Our observations provide the first direct evidence of counter-propagating
fast magnetosonic waves that can potentially lead to turbulent cascade and carry significant energy
flux for coronal heating in low-corona magnetic structures.
