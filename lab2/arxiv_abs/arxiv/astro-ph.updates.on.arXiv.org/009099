(Abridged) We explore the massive cluster XMMXCSJ2215.9-1738 at z~1.5 with KMOS spectroscopy
of Halpha and [NII] covering a region that corresponds to about one virial radius. Using published
spectroscopic redshifts of 108 galaxies in and around the cluster we computed the location of galaxies
in the projected velocity vs. position phase-space to separate our cluster sample into a virialized
region of objects accreted longer ago (roughly inside half R200) and a region of infalling galaxies.
We measured oxygen abundances for ten cluster galaxies with detected [NII] lines in the individual
galaxy spectra and compared the MZR of the galaxies inside half R200 with the infalling galaxies
and a field sample at similar redshifts. We find that the oxygen abundances of individual z~1.5 star-forming
cluster galaxies inside half R200 are comparable, at the respective stellar mass, to the higher
local SDSS metallicity values. The metallicities of these galaxies in the inner part of the cluster
are higher by 0.1-0.2dex, at a given mass, than those of infalling galaxies and of field galaxies
at z~1.5. This effect is more pronounced when using the O3N2 metallicity calibration compared to
the N2 calibration, which can be explained by the different locations of cluster and field galaxies
in the [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [NII]/Halpha diagram involving two line ratios compared to one line ratio
information in the case of the N2 relation. The enhanced metallicities of cluster galaxies at z~1.5
inside half R200 indicate that the density of the ICM in this massive cluster becomes high enough
toward the cluster center such that the ram pressure exceeds the restoring pressure of the hot gas
reservoir of cluster galaxies and can remove this gas reservoir initiating quenching, although
the galaxies continue to form stars, at slightly lower rates, using the available cold gas in the
disk which is not stripped.
