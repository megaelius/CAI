LIGO's detection of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers was an unexpected surprise
that immediately raised the question - what is the origin of these black hole binaries? The "simplest"
scenario is evolution of field massive stellar binaries. However, other possibilities involving
capture have been proposed. We explore here one of the more interesting clues on this puzzle: the
relatively modest spins of the resulting black holes that imply that the progenitor black holes
were not spinning rapidly. More specifically we consider the implication of observed distribution
of, $\chi_{\rm eff}$, the mass weighted projected (along the orbital axis) spins on the field evolution
scenario. In all cases $\chi_{\rm eff}$ is small and in two of the cases the best fit value is negative.
Only in one event the spin is positive at 90\% credible. These observations are puzzling within the
field binary scenario in which positive higher spins ($\chi_{\rm eff} \ge 0.5$) are expected. At
first sight one may expect that this rules out the field evolutionary scenario. Indeed we show that
with typical parameters a significant fraction ($\ge 25\%$) of the mergers should have high effective
spin values. However, uncertainties in the outcome of the common envelope phase (the typical separation
and whether the stars are rotating or not) and in the late stages of massive star evolution (the strength
of the winds) make it impossible to rule out, at present, these scenarios. While observations of
mergers with high effective spin will support this scenario, future observations of negative spin
mergers would rule it out.
