The recent discovery of super-massive black holes (SMBHs) in the centers of high-mass ultra compact
dwarf galaxies (UCDs) suggests that at least some UCDs are the stripped nuclear star clusters of
lower mass galaxies. Tracing these former nuclei of stripped galaxies provides a unique way to track
the assembly history of a galaxy or galaxy cluster. In this paper we present a new method to estimate
how many UCDs host an SMBH in their center and thus are stripped galaxy nuclei. We revisit the dynamical
mass measurements that suggest many UCDs have more mass than expected from stellar population estimates,
which recent observations have shown is due to the presence of an SMBH. We revise the stellar population
mass estimates using a new empirical relation between the mass-to-light ratio (M/L) and metallicity,
and use this to predict which UCDs are most likely to host an SMBH. This enables us to calculate the
fraction of UCDs that host SMBHs across their entire luminosity range for the first time. We then
apply the SMBH occupation fraction to the observed luminosity function of UCDs and estimate that
in the Fornax and Virgo cluster alone there should be $69^{+32}_{-25}$ stripped nuclei with SMBHs.
This analysis shows that stripped nuclei with SMBHs are almost as common in clusters as present-day
galaxy nuclei. We estimate the local SMBH number density in stripped nuclei to $3-8\times10^{-3}Mpc^{-3}$,
which represents a significant fraction (10-40\%) of the SMBH density in the local Universe. These
SMBHs hidden in stripped nuclei will increase expected event rates for tidal disruption events
and SMBH-SMBH and SMBH-BH mergers. The existence of numerous stripped nuclei with SMBHs are a direct
consequence of hierarchical galaxy formation, but until now their impact on the SMBH density had
not been quantified.
