We present a detailed light curve analysis of RR Lyrae variables at multiple wavelengths using Fourier
decomposition method. The time-series data for RR Lyrae variables in the Galactic bulge and the
Magellanic Clouds are taken from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment survey while the
infrared light curves are compiled from the literature. We also analyse the multiband theoretical
light curves that are generated from the stellar pulsation models of RR Lyrae stars for a wide range
of metal-abundances. We find that the theoretical light curve parameters with different metal
abundances are consistent with observed parameters in most period bins at both optical and infrared
wavelengths. The theoretical and observed Fourier amplitude parameters decrease with increase
in wavelength while the Fourier phase parameters increase with wavelength at a given period. We
use absolute magnitudes for a subset of theoretical models that fit the observed optical RR Lyrae
light curves in the Large Magellanic Cloud to estimate a distance modulus, $\mu_\textrm{LMC}=18.51\pm0.07$,
independent of the metallicity. We also use Fourier analysis to study the period-color and amplitude-color
relations for RR Lyrae stars in the Magellanic Clouds using optical data and find that the slope of
period-color relation at minimum light is very shallow or flat and becomes increasingly significant
at the maximum light for RRab stars. We also find that the metallicity dependence of the period-color
relations increases as we go from minimum to maximum light, suggesting that the mean light results
are indeed an average of the various pulsational phases. We summarize that the average variation
in these relations is consistent between theory and observations and supports the theory of the
interaction of the stellar photosphere and the hydrogen ionization front.
