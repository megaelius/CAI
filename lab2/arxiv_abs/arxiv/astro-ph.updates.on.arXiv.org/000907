In the hierarchical structure formation model, clusters of galaxies form through a sequence of
mergers and continuous mass accretion, which generate significant random gas motions especially
in their outskirts where material is actively accreting. Non-thermal pressure provided by the
internal gas motions affects the thermodynamic structure of the X-ray emitting intracluster plasma
and introduces biases in the physical interpretation of X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect observations.
However, we know very little about the nature of gas motions in galaxy clusters. The ASTRO-H X-ray
mission, scheduled to launch in 2015, will have a calorimeter capable of measuring gas motions in
galaxy clusters at the level of <100 km/s. In this work, we make a prediction of the level of gas
motions expected in the LCDM model using hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy cluster formation,
focusing on the merger-induced gas motions. We show that the gas velocity dispersion is larger in
more massive clusters, but exhibits large scatter due to the diversity in their dynamical states.
We show that systems with large gas motions are morphological disturbed, while early forming, relaxed
groups show a smaller level of merger-induced gas motions. By analyzing mock deep ASTRO-H observations
of simulated clusters, we show that such observations can accurately measure the gas velocity dispersion
in the outskirts of nearby relaxed galaxy clusters. ASTRO-H analysis of merging clusters, on the
other hand, requires multi-component spectral fitting, which provides rich information about
their dynamical states, such as the peculiar velocities and the velocity dispersion of gas within
individual sub-clusters. Our analyses indicate that the ASTRO-H mission should be capable of measuring
the missing energy associated with internal gas flows as well as enabling unique studies of substructures
in galaxy clusters.
