NASA's Kepler mission discovered $\sim700$ planets in multi-planet systems containing 3 or more
transiting bodies, many of which are super-Earths and mini-Neptunes in compact configurations.
Using $N$-body simulations, we examine the in situ, final stage assembly of multi-planet systems
via the collisional accretion of protoplanets. Our initial conditions are constructed using a
subset of the Kepler 5-planet systems as templates. Two different prescriptions for treating planetary
collisions are adopted. The simulations address numerous questions: do the results depend on the
accretion prescription?; do the resulting systems resemble the Kepler systems, and do they reproduce
the observed distribution of planetary multiplicities when synthetically observed?; do collisions
lead to significant modification of protoplanet compositions, or to stripping of gaseous envelopes?;
do the eccentricity distributions agree with those inferred for the Kepler planets? We find the
accretion prescription is unimportant in determining the outcomes. The final planetary systems
look broadly similar to the Kepler templates adopted, but the observed distributions of planetary
multiplicities or eccentricities are not reproduced, because scattering does not excite the systems
sufficiently. In addition, we find that $\sim 1$% of our final systems contain a co-orbital planet
pair in horseshoe or tadpole orbits. Post-processing the collision outcomes suggests they would
not significantly change the ice fractions of initially ice-rich protoplanets, but significant
stripping of gaseous envelopes appears likely. Hence, it may be difficult to reconcile the observation
that many low mass Kepler planets have H/He envelopes with an in situ formation scenario that involves
giant impacts after dispersal of the gas disc.
