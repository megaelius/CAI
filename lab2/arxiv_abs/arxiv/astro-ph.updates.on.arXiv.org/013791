Astronomical imaging with micro-arcsecond ($\mu$as) angular resolution could enable breakthrough
scientific discoveries. Previously-proposed $\mu$as X-ray imager designs have been interferometers
with limited effective collecting area. Here we describe X-ray telescopes achieving diffraction-limited
performance over a wide energy band with large effective area, employing a nested-shell architecture
with grazing-incidence mirrors, while matching the optical path lengths between all shells. We
present two compact nested-shell Wolter Type 2 grazing-incidence telescope designs for diffraction-limited
X-ray imaging: a micro-arcsecond telescope design with 14 $\mu$as angular resolution and 2.9 m$^2$
of effective area at 5 keV photon energy ($\lambda$=0.25 nm), and a smaller milli-arcsecond telescope
design with 525 $\mu$as resolution and 645 cm$^2$ effective area at 1 keV ($\lambda$=1.24 nm). We
describe how to match the optical path lengths between all shells in a compact mirror assembly, and
investigate chromatic and off-axis aberrations. Chromatic aberration results from total external
reflection off of mirror surfaces, and we greatly mitigate its effects by slightly adjusting the
path lengths in each mirror shell. The mirror surface height error and alignment requirements for
diffraction-limited performance are challenging but arguably achieveable in the coming decades.
Since the focal ratio for a diffraction-limited X-ray telescope is extremely large ($f/D$~10$^5$),
the only important off-axis aberration is curvature of field, so a 1 arcsecond field of view is feasible
with a flat detector. The detector must fly in formation with the mirror assembly, but relative positioning
tolerances are on the order of 1 m over a distance of some tens to hundreds of kilometers. While there
are many challenges to achieving diffraction-limited X-ray imaging, we did not find any fundamental
barriers.
