Low-resolution spectra are proved competitive to high-resolution spectra in determining many
stellar labels at comparable precision. It is useful to consider the spectral information content
when assessing the capability of a stellar spectrum in deriving precise stellar labels. In this
work, we quantify the information content brought by the LAMOST-II medium-resolution spectroscopic
survey (MRS) using the gradient spectra and the coefficients-of-dependence (CODs). In general,
the wavelength coverage of the MRS well constrains the stellar labels but the sensitivities of different
stellar labels vary with spectral types and metallicity of the stars of interest and, therefore,
affect the performance of the stellar label determination from the MRS spectra. Applying the SLAM
to the synthetic spectra which mimic the MRS data, we find the precision of the fundamental stellar
parameters Teff, logg and [M/H] are better when combining both the blue and red bands of the MRS. This
is especially important for warm stars since the H$\alpha$ line located in the red part plays a more
important role in determining the effective temperature for warm stars. With blue and red parts
together, we are able to reach similar performance to the low-resolution spectra except for warm
stars. However, at [M/H]$\sim-2.0$ dex, the uncertainties of fundamental stellar labels estimated
from MRS are substantially larger than those from low-resolution spectra. We also tested the uncertainties
of Teff, logg and [M/H] of from MRS data induced from the radial velocity mismatch and find that a mismatch
of about 1 km s$^{-1}$, which is typical for LAMOST MRS data, would not significantly affect the stellar
label estimates. At last, reference precision limits are calculated using synthetic gradient
spectra, according to which we expect abundances of at least 17 elements to be measured precisely
from MRS spectra.
