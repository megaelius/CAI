We carry out a theoretical investigation on the collective dynamics of an ensemble of correlated
atoms, subject to both vacuum fluctuations of spacetime and stochastic gravitational waves. A
general approach is taken with the derivation of a quantum master equation capable of describing
arbitrary confined nonrelativistic matter systems in an open quantum gravitational environment.
It enables us to relate the spectral function for gravitational waves and the distribution function
for quantum gravitational fluctuations and to indeed introduce a new spectral function for the
zero-point fluctuations of spacetime. The formulation is applied to two-level identical bosonic
atoms in an off-resonant high-$Q$ cavity that effectively inhibits undesirable electromagnetic
delays, leading to a gravitational transition mechanism through certain quadrupole moment operators.
The overall relaxation rate before reaching equilibrium is found to generally scale collectively
with the number $N$ of atoms. However, we are also able to identify certain states of which the decay
and excitation rates with stochastic gravitational waves and vacuum spacetime fluctuations amplify
more significantly with a factor of $N^2$. Using such favourable states as a means of measuring both
conventional stochastic gravitational waves and novel zero-point spacetime fluctuations, we
determine the theoretical lower bounds for the respective spectral functions. Finally, we discuss
the implications of our findings on future observations of gravitational waves of a wider spectral
window than currently accessible. Especially, the possible sensing of the zero-point fluctuations
of spacetime could provide an opportunity to generate initial evidence and further guidance of
quantum gravity.
