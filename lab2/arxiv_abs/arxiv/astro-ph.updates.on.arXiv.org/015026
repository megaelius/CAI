We contrast the kinematics and dark matter contents of $z=2$ star-forming galaxies (SFGs) from
state-of-the art cosmological simulations within the $\Lambda$CDM framework to observations.
To this end, we create realistic mock observations of massive SFGs ($M_*>4\times10^{10} M_{\odot}$,
SFR $>50~M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) from the TNG50 simulation of the IllustrisTNG suite, resembling
near-infrared, adaptive-optics assisted integral-field observations from the ground. Using
observational line fitting and modeling techniques, we analyse in detail the kinematics of seven
TNG50 galaxies from five different projections per galaxy, and compare them to observations of
twelve massive SFGs by Genzel et al. (2020). The simulated galaxies show clear signs of disc rotation
but mostly exhibit more asymmetric rotation curves, partly due to large intrinsic radial and vertical
velocity components. At identical inclination angle, their one-dimensional velocity profiles
can vary along different lines of sight by up to $\Delta v=200$ km s$^{-1}$. From dynamical modelling
we infer rotation speeds and velocity dispersions that are in the ballpark of observational results.
We find low central dark matter fractions compatible with observations ($f_{\rm DM}^v(<R_e)=v_{\rm
DM}^2(R_e)/v_{\rm circ}^2(R_e)\sim0.29\pm0.11$), however for disc effective radii $R_e$ that
are too small: at fixed $R_e$ the TNG50 dark matter fractions are too high by factors of $1.5-5$. We
speculate that the differences in kinematics and dark matter content compared to the observations
may be due to physical processes which are not resolved in sufficient detail with the numerical resolution
available in current cosmological simulations.
