We present a comparative study of the low-frequency eclipses of spider (compact, irradiating binary)
PSRs B1957+20 and J1816+4510. Combining these data with those of three other eclipsing systems
we study the frequency dependence of the eclipse duration. PSRs B1957+20 and J1816+4510 have similar
orbital properties, but the companions to the pulsars have masses that differ by an order of magnitude.
A dedicated campaign to simultaneously observe the pulsed and imaged continuum flux densities
throughout the eclipses reveals many similarities between the excess material within the two binaries,
irrespective of the companion star properties. The observations show that the pulsar fluxes are
removed from the line of sight throughout the main body of the eclipses. For PSR J1816+4510 we present
the first direct evidence of an eclipse mechanism that transitions from one that removes the pulsar
flux from the line of sight to one that merely smears out pulsations, and claim that this is a consequence
of scattering in a tail of material flowing behind the companion. Inferred mass loss rates from the
companion stars are found to be $\dot{M}_{\text{C}} \sim 10^{-12}~M_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$ and $\dot{M}_{\text{C}}
\sim 2 \times 10^{-13}~M_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$ for PSR B1957+20 and PSR J1816+4510, respectively;
seemingly too low to evaporate the stars within Hubble time. Measurements of eclipse durations
over a wide range of radio-frequencies show a significant dependence of eclipse duration on frequency
for all pulsars, with wider eclipses at lower-frequencies. These results provide a marked improvement
in the observational constraints available for theoretical studies of the eclipse mechanisms.
