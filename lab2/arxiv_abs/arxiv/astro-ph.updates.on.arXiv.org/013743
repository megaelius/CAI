Partial condensation of dust from the Solar nebula is likely responsible for the diverse chemical
compositions of chondrites and rocky planets/planetesimals in the inner Solar system. We present
a forward physical-chemical model of a protoplanetary disc to predict the chemical compositions
of planetary building blocks that may form from such a disc. Our model includes the physical evolution
of the disc and the condensation, partial advection, and decoupling of the dust within it. The chemical
composition of the condensate changes with time and radius. We compare the results of two dust condensation
models: one where an element condenses when the midplane temperature in the disc is lower than the
50\% condensation temperature ($\rm T_{50}$) of that element and the other where the condensation
of the dust is calculated by a Gibbs free energy minimization technique assuming chemical equilibrium
at local disc temperature and pressure. The results of two models are generally consistent with
some systematic differences of $\sim 10$\% depending upon the radial distance and an element's
condensation temperature. Both models predict compositions similar to CM, CO, and CV chondrites
provided that the decoupling timescale of the dust is on the order of the evolution timescale of the
disc or longer. If the decoupling timescale is too short, the composition deviates significantly
from the measured values. These models may contribute to our understanding of the chemical compositions
of chondrites, and ultimately the terrestrial planets in the solar system, and may constrain the
potential chemical compositions of rocky exoplanets.
