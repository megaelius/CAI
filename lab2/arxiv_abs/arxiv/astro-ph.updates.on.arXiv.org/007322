Gravitational-wave detectors can search for yet-undiscovered ultralight bosons, including
those conjectured to solve problems in particle physics, high-energy theory and cosmology. Ground-based
instruments could probe boson masses between $10^{-15}$ eV to $10^{-11}$ eV, which are largely
inaccessible to other experiments. In this paper, we explore the prospect of searching for the continuous
gravitational waves generated by boson clouds around known black holes. We carefully study the
predicted waveforms and use the latest-available numerical results to model signals for different
black-hole and boson parameters. We then demonstrate the suitability of a specific method (hidden
Markov model tracking) to efficiently search for such signals, even when the source parameters
are not perfectly known and allowing for some uncertainty in theoretical predictions. We empirically
study this method's sensitivity and computational cost in the context of boson signals, finding
that it will be possible to target remnants from compact-binary mergers localized with at least
three instruments. For signals from scalar clouds, we also compute detection horizons for future
detectors (Advanced LIGO, LIGO Voyager, Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope). Among other
results, we find that, after one year of observation, an Advanced LIGO detector at design sensitivity
could detect these sources up to over 100 Mpc, while Cosmic Explorer could reach over $10^4$ Mpc.
These projections offer a more complete picture than previous estimates based on analytic approximations
to the signal power or idealized search strategies. Finally, we discuss specific implications
for the followup of compact-binary coalescences and black holes in x-ray binaries. Along the way,
we review the basic physics of bosons around black holes, in the hope of providing a bridge between
the theory and data-analysis literatures.
