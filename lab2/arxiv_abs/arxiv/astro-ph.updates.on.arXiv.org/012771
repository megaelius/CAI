We calculate spatial correlation functions of galaxies, $\xi(r)$, structure functions, $g(r)=1
+\xi(r)$, and fractal dimension functions, $D(x)= 3+\gamma(r) = 3+ d \log g(r)/ d \log r$, using
dark matter particles of biased $\Lambda$ cold dark matter (CDM) simulation, observed galaxies
of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and simulated galaxies of the Millennium and EAGLE simulations.
We analyse how these functions describe fractal and other geometrical properties of the cosmic
web. Correlation functions of biased $\Lambda$CDM model samples describe at small distances (particle/galaxy
separations), galaxy samples only brightest galaxies in clusters are visible, and the transition
from clusters to filaments occurs at distance $r \approx 0.8 - 1.5$~\Mpc. On larger separations
correlation functions describe the distribution of matter and galaxies in the whole cosmic web.
The effective fractal dimension of the cosmic web is a continuous function of the distance (separation).
On small separations, $ r \le 2$~\Mpc, the fractal dimension decreases from $D \approx 1.5$ to $D
\approx 0$, reflecting the distribution inside halos/clusters. The minimum of the fractal dimension
function $D(r)$ near $r \approx 2$ is deeper for more luminous galaxies. On medium separations,
$2 \le r \le 10$~\Mpc, the fractal dimension grows from $\approx 0$ to $\approx 2$, and approaches
at large separations 3 (random distribution). Real and simulated galaxies of low luminosity, $M_r
\ge -19$, have almost identical correlation lengths and amplitudes, indicating that dwarf galaxies
are satellites of brighter galaxies, and do not form a smooth population in voids.
