We use MUSE/VLT to conduct a survey of $z\sim3$ physical quasar pairs at close separation with a fast
observation strategy. Our aim is twofold: (i) explore the Ly$\alpha$ glow around the faint-end
of the quasar population; (ii) take advantage of the combined illumination of a quasar pair to unveil
large-scale intergalactic structures extending between the two quasars. Here, we report the results
for a quasar pair ($z=3.020,3.008$; $i=21.84,22.15$), separated by 11.6 arcsec (or 89 projected
kpc). MUSE reveals filamentary Ly$\alpha$ structures extending between the two quasars with an
average surface brightness of SB$_{\rm Ly\alpha}=1.8\times10^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$
arcsec$^{-2}$. Photoionization models of the constraints in the Ly$\alpha$, HeII, and CIV line
emissions show that the emitting structures are intergalactic bridges with an extent between $\sim89$
and up to $\sim600$ kpc. Our models rule out the possibility that the structure extends for $\sim
2.9$ Mpc, i.e., the separation inferred from the uncertain systemic redshift difference of the
quasars if the difference was only due to the Hubble flow. At the current spatial resolution and surface
brightness limit, the average projected width of an individual bridge is about 35 kpc. We also detect
a strong absorption in HI, NV, and CIV along the background sight-line at higher $z$, which we interpret
as due to at least two components of cool, metal enriched, and relatively ionized CGM or IGM surrounding
the quasar pair. Two additional HI absorbers are detected along both quasar sight-lines at $\sim
-900$ and $-2800$ km s$^{-1}$ from the system, with the latter having associated CIV absorption
only along the foreground quasar sight-line. The absence of galaxies in the MUSE field of view at
the redshifts of these two absorbers suggests that they trace large-scale structures or expanding
shells in front of the quasar pair.
