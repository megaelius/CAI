Science Verification (SV) data of solar observations with Atacama Large Millimeter-submillimeter
Array (ALMA) telescope were released to the scientific community. Understanding the centre to
limb brightness function is necessary to compare features in full disk images. Our goals are to find
the empirical centre to limb brightness functions in two available spectral bands and create flattened
images with centre to limb brightness variations removed. We used second-order polynomial fit
of the cosine of incidence angle to data points as a function of radial distance to the centre of the
solar disk. The method also includes iterative removal of outliers based on the interquartile range.
Fitting functions for all available images proved to adequately describe the data with comparatively
small errors in the fitting coefficients. In both bands we found brightening towards the limb which
is a consequence of increase in electron temperatures with radial distance in this region of the
solar atmosphere. This study found that the $T_{b}$ of an active region has about 180 K difference
between with and without the limb brightening at radial distance $\approx$0.75$R_{\odot}$ in
Band 6. We also made flattened images with limb brightening removed. The limb brightening effect
in ALMA images is significant enough (of the order of 10% for Band 3 and about 15% in Band 6) that it can
not be neglected in further analyses. Since the effect of the side lobes was not included in this study,
these values probably represent the lower limit of the limb brightening. The shape of the limb brightening
function can also be used to constrain electron densities and temperatures in various layers of
the solar atmosphere.
