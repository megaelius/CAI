We examined the solar gravitational lens (SGL) as the means to produce direct high-resolution,
multipixel images of exoplanets. The properties of the SGL are remarkable: it offers maximum light
amplification of ~1e11 and angular resolution of ~1e-10 arcsec. A probe with a 1-m telescope in the
SGL focal region can image an exoplanet at 30 pc with 10-kilometer resolution on its surface, sufficient
to observe seasonal changes, oceans, continents, surface topography. We reached and exceeded
all objectives set for our study: We developed a new wave-optical approach to study the imaging of
exoplanets while treating them as extended, resolved, faint sources at large but finite distances.
We properly accounted for the solar corona brightness. We developed deconvolution algorithms
and demonstrated the feasibility of high-quality image reconstruction under realistic conditions.
We have proven that multipixel imaging and spectroscopy of exoplanets with the SGL are feasible.
We have developed a new mission concept that delivers an array of optical telescopes to the SGL focal
region relying on three innovations: i) a new way to enable direct exoplanet imaging, ii) use of smallsats
solar sails fast transit through the solar system and beyond, iii) an open architecture to take advantage
of swarm technology. This approach enables entirely new missions, providing a great leap in capabilities
for NASA and the greater aerospace community. Our results are encouraging as they lead to a realistic
design for a mission that will be able to make direct resolved images of exoplanets in our stellar
neighborhood. It could allow exploration of exoplanets relying on the SGL capabilities decades,
if not centuries, earlier than possible with other extant technologies. The architecture and mission
concepts for a mission to the strong interference region of the SGL are promising and should be explored
further.
