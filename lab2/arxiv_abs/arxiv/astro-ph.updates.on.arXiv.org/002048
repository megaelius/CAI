The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has observed highly energetic neutrinos in excess of the expected
atmospheric neutrino background. It is intriguing to consider the possibility that such events
are probing physics beyond the standard model. In this context, $\mathcal{O}$(PeV) dark matter
particles decaying to neutrinos have been considered while dark matter annihilation has been dismissed
invoking the unitarity bound as a limiting factor. However, the latter claim was done ignoring the
contribution from dark matter substructure, which for PeV Cold Dark Matter would extend down to
a free streaming mass of $\mathcal{O}$($10^{-18}$M$_\odot$). Since the unitarity bound is less
stringent at low velocities, ($\sigma_{\rm ann}$v)$\leq4\pi/m_\chi^2v$, then, it is possible
that these cold and dense subhalos would contribute dominantly to a dark-matter-induced neutrino
flux and easily account for the events observed by IceCube. A Sommerfeld-enhanced dark matter model
can naturally support such scenario. Interestingly, the spatial distribution of the events shows
features that would be expected in a dark matter interpretation. Although not conclusive, 9 of the
37 events appear to be clustered around a region near the Galactic Center while 6 others spatially
coincide, within the reported angular errors, with 5 of 26 Milky Way satellites. However, a simple
estimate of the probability of the latter occurring by chance is $\sim35\%$. More events are needed
to statistically test this hypothesis. PeV dark matter particles are massive enough that their
abundance as standard thermal relics would overclose the Universe. This issue can be solved in alternative
scenarios, for instance if the decay of new massive unstable particles generates significant entropy
reheating the Universe to a slightly lower temperature than the freeze-out temperature, $T_{\rm
RH} \lesssim T_{\rm f}\sim4\times10^4$~GeV.
