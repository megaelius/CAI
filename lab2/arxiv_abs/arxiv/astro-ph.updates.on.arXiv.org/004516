Extremely metal-poor stars provide us with indirect information on the first generations of massive
stars. The TOPoS survey has been designed to increase the census of these stars and to provide a chemical
inventory that is as detailed as possible. Seven of the most iron-poor stars have been observed with
the UVES spectrograph at the ESO VLT Kueyen 8.2m telescope to refine their chemical composition.
We analysed the spectra based on 1D LTE model atmospheres, but also used 3D hydrodynamical simulations
of stellar atmospheres. We measured carbon in six of the seven stars: all are carbon-enhanced and
belong to the low-carbon band, defined in the TOPoS II paper. We measured lithium (A(Li)=1.9) in
the most iron-poor star (SDSS J1035+0641, [Fe/H] < -5.2 ). We were also able to measure Li in three
stars at [Fe/H]~ -4.0, two of which lie on the Spite plateau. We confirm that SDSS J1349+1407 is extremely
rich in Mg, but not in Ca. It is also very rich in Na. Several of our stars are characterised by low alpha-to-iron
ratios. The lack of high-carbon band stars at low metallicity can be understood in terms of evolutionary
timescales of binary systems. The detection of Li in SDSS J1035+0641 places a strong constraint
on theories that aim at solving the cosmological lithium problem. The Li abundance of the two warmer
stars at [Fe/H]~ -4.0 places them on the Spite plateau, while the third, cooler star, lies below.
We argue that this suggests that the temperature at which Li depletion begins increases with decreasing
[Fe/H]. SDSS J1349+1407 may belong to a class of Mg-rich EMP stars. We cannot assess if there is a scatter
in alpha-to-iron ratios among the EMP stars or if there are several discrete populations. However,
the existence of stars with low alpha-to-iron ratios is supported by our observations.
