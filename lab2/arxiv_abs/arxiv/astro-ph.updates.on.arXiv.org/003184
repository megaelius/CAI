A large fraction of giant planets have gaseous envelopes that are limited to about 10 % of their total
mass budget. Such planets are present in the Solar System (Uranus, Neptune) and are frequently observed
in short periods around other stars (the so-called Super-Earths). In contrast to these observations,
theoretical calculations based on the evolution of hydrostatic envelopes argue that such low mass
envelopes cannot be maintained around cores exceeding five Earth masses. Instead, under nominal
disc conditions, these planets would acquire massive envelopes through runaway gas accretion
within the lifetime of the protoplanetary disc. In this work, we show that planetary envelopes are
not in hydrostatic balance, which slows down envelope growth. A series of 3-dimensional, global,
radiative hydrodynamical simulations reveal a steady state gas flow, which enters through the
poles and exits in the disc midplane. Gas is pushed through the outer envelope in about 10 orbital
timescales. In regions of the disc that are not significantly dust-depleted, envelope accretion
onto cores of about five Earth masses can get stalled as the gas flow enters the deep interior. Accreted
solids sublimate deep in the convective interior, but small opacity-providing grains are trapped
in the flow and do not settle, which further prevents rapid envelope accretion. The transition to
runaway gas accretion can however be reached when cores grow larger than typical Super-Earths,
beyond 15 Earth masses, and preferably when disc opacities are below kappa=1 cm^2/g. These findings
offer an explanation for the typical low-mass envelopes around the cores of Super-Earths.
