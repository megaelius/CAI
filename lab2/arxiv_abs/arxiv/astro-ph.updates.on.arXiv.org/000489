SARAS is a correlation spectrometer purpose designed for precision measurements of the cosmic
radio background and faint features in the sky spectrum at long wavelengths that arise from redshifted
21-cm from gas in the reionization epoch. SARAS operates in the octave band 87.5-175 MHz. We present
herein the system design arguing for a complex correlation spectrometer concept. The SARAS design
concept provides a differential measurement between the antenna temperature and that of an internal
reference termination, with measurements in switched system states allowing for cancellation
of additive contaminants from a large part of the signal flow path including the digital spectrometer.
A switched noise injection scheme provides absolute spectral calibration. Additionally, we argue
for an electrically small frequency-independent antenna over an absorber ground. Various critical
design features that aid in avoidance of systematics and in providing calibration products for
the parametrization of other unavoidable systematics are described and the rationale discussed.
The signal flow and processing is analyzed and the response to noise temperatures of the antenna,
reference termination and amplifiers is computed. Multi-path propagation arising from internal
reflections are considered in the analysis, which includes a harmonic series of internal reflections.
We opine that the SARAS design concept is advantageous for precision measurement of the absolute
cosmic radio background spectrum; therefore, the design features and analysis methods presented
here are expected to serve as a basis for implementations tailored to measurements of a multiplicity
of features in the background sky at long wavelengths, which may arise from events in the dark ages
and subsequent reionization era.
