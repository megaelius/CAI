Absorption spectroscopy of gravitationally lensed quasars (GLQs) enables study of spatial variations
in the interstellar and/or circumgalactic medium of foreground galaxies. We report observations
of 4 GLQs, each with two images separated by 0.8-3.0", that show strong absorbers at redshifts 0.4$<$$z_{abs}$$<$1.3
in their spectra, including some at the lens redshift with impact parameters 1.5-6.9 kpc. We measure
H I Lyman lines along two sight lines each in five absorbers (10 sight lines in total) using HST STIS,
and metal lines using Magellan Echellette or Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our data have doubled the
lens galaxy sample with measurements of H I column densities ($N_{\rm H I}$) and metal abundances
along multiple sight lines. Our data, combined with the literature, show no strong correlation
between absolute values of differences in $N_{\rm H I}$, $N_{\rm Fe II}$, or [Fe/H] and the sight
line separations at the absorber redshifts for separations of 0-8 kpc. The estimated abundance
gradients show a tentative anti-correlation with abundances at galaxy centers. Some lens galaxies
show inverted gradients, possibly suggesting central dilution by mergers or infall of metal-poor
gas. [Fe/H] measurements and masses estimated from GLQ astrometry suggest the lens galaxies lie
below the total mass-metallicity relation for early-type galaxies as well as measurements for
quasar-galaxy pairs and gravitationally lensed galaxies at comparable redshifts. This difference
may arise in part from the dust depletion of Fe. Higher resolution measurements of H and metals (especially
undepleted elements) for more GLQ absorbers and accurate lens redshifts are needed to confirm these
trends.
