Galaxy formation models invoke the presence of strong feedback mechanisms that regulate the growth
of massive galaxies at high redshifts. In this paper we aim to: (1) confirm spectroscopically the
redshifts of a sample of massive galaxies selected with photometric redshifts z > 2.5; (2) investigate
the properties of their stellar and interstellar media; (3) detect the presence of outflows, and
measure their velocities. To achieve this, we analysed deep, high-resolution (R~2000) FORS2 rest-frame
UV spectra for 11 targets. We confirmed that 9 out of 11 have spectroscopic redshifts z > 2.5. We
also serendipitously found two mask fillers at redshift z > 2.5, which originally were assigned
photometric redshifts 2.0 < z < 2.5. In the four highest-quality spectra we derived outflow
velocities by fitting the absorption line profiles with models including multiple dynamical components.
We found strongly asymmetric, high-ionisation lines, from which we derived outflow velocities
ranging from 480 to 1518 km/s. The two galaxies with highest velocity show signs of AGN. We revised
the spectral energy distribution fitting U-band through 8 micron photometry, including the analysis
of a power-law component subtraction to identify the possible presence of active galactic nuclei
(AGN). The revised stellar masses of all but one of our targets are >1e10 Msun, with four having
stellar masses > 5e10 Msun. Three galaxies have a significant power-law component in their spectral
energy distributions, which indicates that they host AGN. We conclude that massive galaxies are
characterised by significantly higher velocity outflows than the typical Lyman break galaxies
at z ~ 3. The incidence of high-velocity outflows (~40% within our sample) is also much higher than
among massive galaxies at z < 1, which is consistent with the powerful star formation and nuclear
activity that most massive galaxies display at z > 2.
