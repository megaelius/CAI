Neutral Fe lines in metal-poor stars yield conflicting abundances depending on whether and how
deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) are considered. We have collected new high
resolution and high signal-to-noise ultraviolet (UV) spectra of three warm dwarf stars with [Fe/H]
= -2.9 with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. We locate archival
UV spectra for three other warm dwarfs with [Fe/H] = -3.3, -2.2, and -1.6, supplemented with optical
spectra for all six stars. We calculate stellar parameters using methods that are largely independent
of the spectra, adopting broadband photometry, color-temperature relations, Gaia parallaxes,
and assumed masses. We use the LTE line analysis code MOOG to derive Fe abundances from hundreds of
Fe I and Fe II lines with wavelengths from 2290 to 6430 Angstroms. The [Fe/H] ratios derived separately
from Fe I and Fe II lines agree in all six stars, with [Fe II/H] - [Fe I/H] ranging from +0.00 +/- 0.07
to -0.12 +/- 0.09 dex, when strong lines and Fe I lines with lower excitation potential < 1.2 eV are
excluded. This constrains the extent of any deviations from LTE that may occur within this parameter
range. While our result confirms non-LTE calculations for some warm, metal-poor dwarfs, it may
not be generalizable to more metal-poor dwarfs, where deviations from LTE are predicted to be larger.
We also investigate trends of systematically lower abundances derived from Fe I lines in the Balmer
continuum region (3100-3700 Angstroms), and we conclude that no proposed explanation for this
effect can fully account for the observations presently available.
