We present $\texttt{ENIGMA}$, a time domain, inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model that describes
non-spinning binary black holes systems that evolve on moderately eccentric orbits. The inspiral
evolution is described using a consistent combination of post-Newtonian theory, self-force and
black hole perturbation theory. Assuming eccentric binaries that circularize prior to coalescence,
we smoothly match the eccentric inspiral with a stand-alone, quasi-circular merger, which is constructed
using machine learning algorithms that are trained with quasi-circular numerical relativity
waveforms. We show that $\texttt{ENIGMA}$ reproduces with excellent accuracy the dynamics of
quasi-circular compact binaries. We validate $\texttt{ENIGMA}$ using a set of $\texttt{Einstein
Toolkit}$ eccentric numerical relativity waveforms, which describe eccentric binary black hole
mergers with mass-ratios between $1 \leq q \leq 5.5$, and eccentricities $e_0 \lesssim 0.2$ ten
orbits before merger. We use this model to explore in detail the physics that can be extracted with
moderately eccentric, non-spinning binary black hole mergers. We use $\texttt{ENIGMA}$ to show
that GW150914, GW151226, GW170104, GW170814 and GW170608 can be effectively recovered with spinning,
quasi-circular templates if the eccentricity of these events at a gravitational wave frequency
of 10Hz satisfies $e_0\leq \{0.175,\, 0.125,\,0.175,\,0.175,\, 0.125\}$, respectively. We
show that if these systems have eccentricities $e_0\sim 0.1$ at a gravitational wave frequency
of 10Hz, they can be misclassified as quasi-circular binaries due to parameter space degeneracies
between eccentricity and spin corrections. Using our catalog of eccentric numerical relativity
simulations, we discuss the importance of including higher-order waveform multipoles in gravitational
wave searches of eccentric binary black hole mergers.
