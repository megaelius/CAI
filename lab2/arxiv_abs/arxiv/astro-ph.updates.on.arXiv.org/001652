The radio galaxy NGC 1275, recently identified as a very high energy (VHE, >100 GeV) gamma-ray
emitter by MAGIC, is one of the few non-blazar AGN detected in the VHE regime. In order to better understand
the origin of the gamma-ray emission and locate it within the galaxy, we studied contemporaneous
multi-frequency observations of NGC 1275 and modeled the overall spectral energy distribution
(SED). We analyzed unpublished MAGIC observations carried out between Oct. 2009 and Feb. 2010,
and the previously published ones taken between Aug. 2010 and Feb. 2011. We studied the multi-band
variability and correlations by analyzing data of Fermi-LAT (0.1-100 GeV), as well as Chandra (X-ray),
KVA (optical) and MOJAVE (radio) data taken during the same period. Using customized Monte Carlo
simulations corresponding to early MAGIC stereo data, we detect NGC 1275 also in the earlier campaign.
The flux level and energy spectra are similar to the results of the second campaign. The monthly light
curve >100 GeV shows a hint of variability at the 3.6 sigma level. In the Fermi-LAT band, both flux
and spectral shape variabilities are reported. The optical light curve is variable and shows a clear
correlation with the gamma-ray flux >100 MeV. In radio, 3 compact components are resolved in
the innermost part of the jet. One of them shows a similar trend as the LAT and KVA light curves. The
0.1-650 GeV spectra measured simultaneously with MAGIC and Fermi-LAT can be well fitted either
by a log-parabola or by a power-law with a sub-exponential cutoff for both campaigns. A single-zone
synchrotron-self-Compton model, with an electron spectrum following a power-law with an exponential
cutoff, can explain the broadband SED and the multi-band behavior of the source. However, this model
suggests an untypical low bulk-Lorentz factor or a velocity alignment closer to the line of sight
than the pc-scale radio jet.
