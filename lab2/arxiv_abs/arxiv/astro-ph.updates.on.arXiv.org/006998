We use data from the second data releases of the ESA Gaia astrometric survey and the high-resolution
GALAH spectroscopic survey to analyse the structure of our Galaxy's discs. With GALAH, we can separate
the alpha-rich and alpha-poor discs (with respect to Fe), which are superposed in both position
and velocity space, and examine their distributions in action space. We find clear evidence that
young (< 3 Gyr), metal-rich ([Fe/H] > 0.1) dwarfs have migrated from the inner alpha-poor disc to
the solar neighbourhood. We examine the distribution of stars in the z-V_z phase plane in which a
remarkable `phase spiral' was recently discovered. We show that the spiral extends well beyond
the narrow cylinder in which it was found and is present in both discs but appears most clearly in stars
on less eccentric orbits. We display the phase spiral in V_phi in addition to V_R and identify the
quadrupole signature in the z-V_z plane of a tilting velocity ellipsoid. The spiral is a signature
of corrugated waves that propagate through the disc, and the associated non-equilibrium phase
mixing; our results rule out the idea that it is associated with disrupting star clusters. The radially
asymmetric distribution of stars involved in the phase spiral shows that the corrugation, which
is mostly confined to the alpha-poor disc, grows in z-amplitude as a function of increasing radius.
We present new simulations of tidal disturbance of the Galactic disc by a halo substructure similar
to the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf. The effects on the z-V_z plane of the substructure passing through
the disc last at least 2 Gyr, but a subsequent disc crossing wipes out the coherent structure. These
simulations suggest that the phase spiral was created 500 Myr ago as an object like Sgr with total
mass 3x10^{10} Msun (stripped down from 5x10^{10} Msun when it first entered the halo) passed through
the plane.
