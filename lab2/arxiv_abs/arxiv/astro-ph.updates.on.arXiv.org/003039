Context. Planet formation with pebbles has been proposed to solve a couple of long-standing issues
in the classical formation model. Some sophisticated simulations have been done to confirm the
efficiency of pebble accretion. However, there has not been any global N-body simulations that
compare the outcomes of planet formation via pebble accretion with observed extrasolar planetary
systems. Aims. In this paper, we study the effects of a range of initial parameters of planet formation
via pebble accretion, and present the first results of our simulations. Methods. We incorporate
the pebble accretion model by Ida et al. (2016) in the N-body code SyMBA (Duncan et al. 1998), along
with the effects of gas accretion, eccentricity and inclination damping and planet migration in
the disc. Results. We confirm that pebble accretion leads to a variety of planetary systems, but
have difficulty in reproducing observed properties of exoplanetary systems, such as planetary
mass, semimajor axis, and eccentricity distributions. The main reason behind this is a too-efficient
type I migration, which sensitively depends on the disc model. However, our simulations also lead
to a few interesting predictions. First, we find that formation efficiencies of planets depend
on the stellar metallicities, not only for giant planets, but also for Earths (Es) and Super-Earths
(SEs). The dependency for Es/SEs is subtle. Although higher metallicity environments lead to faster
formation of a larger number of Es/SEs, they also tend to be lost later via dynamical instability.
Second, our results indicate that a wide range of bulk densities observed for Es and SEs is a natural
consequence of dynamical evolution of planetary systems. Third, the ejection trend of our simulations
suggest that one free-floating E/SE may be expected for two smaller-mass planets.
