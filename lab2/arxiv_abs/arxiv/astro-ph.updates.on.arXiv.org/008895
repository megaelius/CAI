Following the pioneering observations with COBE in the early 1990s, studies of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) have focused on temperature and polarization anisotropies. CMB spectral distortions
- tiny departures of the CMB energy spectrum from that of a perfect blackbody - provide a second, independent
probe of fundamental physics, with a reach deep into the primordial Universe. The theoretical foundation
of spectral distortions has seen major advances in recent years, which highlight the immense potential
of this emerging field. Spectral distortions probe a fundamental property of the Universe - its
thermal history - thereby providing additional insight into processes within the cosmological
standard model (CSM) as well as new physics beyond. Spectral distortions are an important tool for
understanding inflation and the nature of dark matter. They shed new light on the physics of recombination
and reionization, both prominent stages in the evolution of our Universe, and furnish critical
information on baryonic feedback processes, in addition to probing primordial correlation functions
at scales inaccessible to other tracers. In principle the range of signals is vast: many orders of
magnitude of discovery space could be explored by detailed observations of the CMB energy spectrum.
Several CSM signals are predicted and provide clear experimental targets, some of which are already
observable with present-day technology. Confirmation of these signals would extend the reach
of the CSM by orders of magnitude in physical scale as the Universe evolves from the initial stages
to its present form. The absence of these signals would pose a huge theoretical challenge, immediately
pointing to new physics.
