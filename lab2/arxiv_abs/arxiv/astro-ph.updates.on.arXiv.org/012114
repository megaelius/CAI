Giant impacts dominate the final stages of terrestrial planet formation and set the configuration
and compositions of the final system of planets. A giant impact is believed to be responsible for
the formation of Earth's Moon, but the specific impact parameters are under debate. Because the
canonical Moon-forming impact is the most intensely studied scenario, it is often considered the
archetypal giant impact. However, a wide range of impacts with different outcomes are possible.
Here we examine the total energy budgets of giant impacts that form Earth-mass bodies and find that
they differ substantially across the wide range of possible Moon-forming events. We show that gravitational
potential energy exchange is important, and we determine the regime in which potential energy has
a significant effect on the collision outcome. Energy is deposited heterogeneously within the
colliding planets, increasing their internal energies, and portions of each body attain sufficient
entropy for vaporization. After gravitational re-equilibration, post-impact bodies are strongly
thermally stratified, with varying amounts of vaporized and supercritical mantle. The canonical
Moon-forming impact is a relatively low energy event and should not be considered the archetype
of accretionary giant impacts that form Earth-mass planets. After a giant impact, bodies are significantly
inflated in size compared to condensed planets of the same mass, and there are substantial differences
in the magnitudes of their potential, kinetic and internal energy components. As a result, the conditions
for metal-silicate equilibration and the subsequent evolution of the planet may vary widely between
different impact scenarios.
