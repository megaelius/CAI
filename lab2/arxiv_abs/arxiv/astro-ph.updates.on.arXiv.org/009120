NGC~1052-DF2, a so-called ultra-diffuse galaxy, was announced to be a galaxy lacking dark matter
based on a spectroscopic study of its constituent globular clusters. Here we present the first spectroscopic
analysis of the stellar body of this galaxy using the MUSE integral-field spectrograph at the (ESO)
Very Large Telescope. The MUSE datacube simultaneously provides DF2's stellar velocity field,
and systemic velocities for seven Globular Clusters (GCs). We further discovered three Planetary
Nebulae (PNe) which are likely part of this galaxy. While five of the clusters had velocities measured
in the literature, we were able to confirm the membership of two more candidates through precise
radial velocity measurements, which increases the measured specific frequency of GCs in DF2. The
mean velocity of the diffuse stellar body, 1792.9$^{-1.8}_{+1.4}$~\kms, is consistent with the
mean globular cluster velocity. We detect a weak but significant velocity gradient within the stellar
body, with a kinematic axis close to the photometric major-axis, making it a prolate-like rotator.
We estimate a velocity dispersion from the clusters and PNe of $\sigma_{\mathrm{int}}=10.6^{+3.9}_{-2.3}$~\kms.
The velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\rm{DF2}\star}$(\re) for the stellar body within one effective
radius is $10.8^{-4.0}_{+3.2}$~\kms. Considering various sources of systemic uncertainties
this central value varies between 5 and 13~\kms, and we conservatively report a 95\% confidence
upper limit to the dispersion within one \re\ of 21~\kms. We provide updated mass estimates based
on these dispersions corresponding to the different distances to NGC~1052-DF2 that have been reported
in the recent literature.
