Extragalactic background light (EBL) plays an important role in cosmology since it traces the history
of galaxy formation and evolution. Such diffuse radiation from near-UV to far-infrared wavelengths
can interact with $\gamma$-rays from distant sources such as active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and
is responsible for the high-energy absorption observed in their spectra. However, probing the
EBL from $\gamma$-ray spectra of AGNs is not trivial due to internal processes that can mimic its
effect. Such processes are usually taken into account in terms of curvature of the intrinsic spectrum.
Hence, an improper choice of parametrization for the latter can seriously affect EBL reconstruction.
In this paper, we propose a statistical approach that avoids a priori assumptions on the intrinsic
spectral curvature and that, for each source, selects the best-fit model on a solid statistical
basis. By combining the ${\it Fermi}$-LAT observations of 490 blazars, we determine the $\gamma$-ray-inferred
level of EBL for various state-of-the-art EBL models. We discuss the EBL level obtained from the
spectra of both BL Lacs and flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) in order to investigate the impact
of internal absorption in different classes of objects. We further scrutinize constraints on the
EBL evolution from $\gamma$-ray observations by reconstructing the EBL level in four redshift
ranges, up to $z\sim2.5$. The approach implemented in this paper, carefully addressing the question
of the modeling of the intrinsic emission at the source, can serve as a solid stepping stone for studies
of hundreds of high-quality spectra acquired by next-generation $\gamma$-ray instruments.
