The Milky Way Galaxy contains an unknown number, $N$, of civilizations that emit electromagnetic
radiation (of unknown wavelengths) over a finite lifetime, $L$. Here we are assuming that the radiation
is not produced indefinitely, but within $L$ as a result of some unknown limiting event. When a civilization
stops emitting, the radiation continues traveling outward at the speed of light, $c$, but is confined
within a shell wall having constant thickness, $cL$. We develop a simple model of the Galaxy that
includes both the birthrate and detectable lifetime of civilizations to compute the possibility
of a SETI detection at the Earth. Two cases emerge for radiation shells that are (1) thinner than or
(2) thicker than the size of the Galaxy, corresponding to detectable lifetimes, $L$, less than or
greater than the light-travel time, $\sim 100,000$ years, across the Milky Way, respectively.
For case (1), each shell wall has a thickness smaller than the size of the Galaxy and intersects the
galactic plane in a donut shape (annulus) that fills only a fraction of the Galaxy's volume, inhibiting
SETI detection. But the ensemble of such shell walls may still fill our Galaxy, and indeed may overlap
locally, given a sufficiently high birthrate of detectable civilizations. In the second case,
each radiation shell is thicker than the size of our Galaxy. Yet, the ensemble of walls may or may not
yield a SETI detection depending on the civilization birthrate. We compare the number of different
electromagnetic transmissions arriving at Earth to Drake's $N$, the number of currently emitting
civilizations, showing that they are equal to each other for both cases (1) and (2). However, for
$L < 100,000$ years, the transmissions arriving at Earth may come from distant civilizations long
extinct, while civilizations still alive are sending signals yet to arrive.
