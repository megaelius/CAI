We introduce the Illustris Project, a series of large-scale hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy
formation. The highest resolution simulation, Illustris-1, covers a volume of $(106.5\,{\rm
Mpc})^3$, has a dark mass resolution of ${6.26 \times 10^{6}\,{\rm M}_\odot}$, and an initial baryonic
matter mass resolution of ${1.26 \times 10^{6}\,{\rm M}_\odot}$. At $z=0$ gravitational forces
are softened on scales of $710\,{\rm pc}$, and the smallest hydrodynamical gas cells have an extent
of $48\,{\rm pc}$. We follow the dynamical evolution of $2\times 1820^3$ resolution elements and
in addition passively evolve $1820^3$ Monte Carlo tracer particles reaching a total particle count
of more than $18$ billion. The galaxy formation model includes: primordial and metal-line cooling
with self-shielding corrections, stellar evolution, stellar feedback, gas recycling, chemical
enrichment, supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from active galactic nuclei. At $z=0$
our simulation volume contains about $40,000$ well-resolved galaxies covering a diverse range
of morphologies and colours including early-type, late-type and irregular galaxies. The simulation
reproduces the cosmic star formation rate density, the galaxy luminosity function, and baryon
conversion efficiency at $z=0$. It also qualitatively captures the impact of galaxy environment
on the red fractions of galaxies. The internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disk
galaxies obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat circular velocity
curves. In the well-resolved regime the simulation reproduces the observed mix of early-type and
late-type galaxies. Our model predicts a halo mass dependent impact of baryonic effects on the halo
mass function and the masses of haloes caused by feedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei.
