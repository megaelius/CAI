The nature of aerosols in hot exoplanet atmospheres is one of the primary vexing questions facing
the exoplanet field. The complex chemistry, multiple formation pathways, and lack of easily identifiable
spectral features associated with aerosols make it especially challenging to constrain their
key properties. We propose a transmission spectroscopy technique to identify the primary aerosol
formation mechanism for the most highly irradiated hot Jupiters (HIHJs). The technique is based
on the expectation that the two key types of aerosols -- photochemically generated hazes and equilibrium
condensate clouds -- are expected to form and persist in different regions of a highly irradiated
planet's atmosphere. Haze can only be produced on the permanent daysides of tidally-locked hot
Jupiters, and will be carried downwind by atmospheric dynamics to the evening terminator (seen
as the trailing limb during transit). Clouds can only form in cooler regions on the night side and
morning terminator of HIHJs (seen as the leading limb during transit). Because opposite limbs are
expected to be impacted by different types of aerosols, ingress and egress spectra, which primarily
probe opposing sides of the planet, will reveal the dominant aerosol formation mechanism. We show
that the benchmark HIHJ, WASP-121b, has a transmission spectrum consistent with partial aerosol
coverage and that ingress-egress spectroscopy would constrain the location and formation mechanism
of those aerosols. In general, using this diagnostic we find that observations with JWST and potentially
with HST should be able to distinguish between clouds and haze for currently known HIHJs.
