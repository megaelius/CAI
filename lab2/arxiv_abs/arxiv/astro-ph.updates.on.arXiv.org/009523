We investigate the redshift evolution of the intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies in the \texttt{MassiveBlackII}
(MBII) simulation. We select galaxy samples above fixed subhalo mass cuts ($M_h>10^{11,12,13}~M_{\odot}/h$)
at $z=0.6$ and trace their progenitors to $z=3$ along their merger trees. Dark matter components
of $z=0.6$ galaxies are more spherical than their progenitors while stellar matter components
tend to be less spherical than their progenitors. The distribution of the galaxy-subhalo misalignment
angle peaks at $\sim10~\mathrm{deg}$ with a mild increase with time. The evolution of the ellipticity-direction~(ED)
correlation amplitude $\omega(r)$ of galaxies (which quantifies the tendency of galaxies to preferentially
point towards surrounding matter overdensities) is governed by the evolution in the alignment
of underlying dark matter~(DM) subhaloes to the matter density of field, as well as the alignment
between galaxies and their DM subhaloes. At scales $\sim1~\mathrm{cMpc}/h$, the alignment between
DM subhaloes and matter overdensity gets suppressed with time, whereas the alignment between galaxies
and DM subhaloes is enhanced. These competing tendencies lead to a complex redshift evolution of
$\omega(r)$ for galaxies at $\sim1~\mathrm{cMpc}/h$. At scales $>1~\mathrm{cMpc}/h$, alignment
between DM subhaloes and matter overdensity does not evolve significantly; the evolution of the
galaxy-subhalo misalignment therefore leads to an increase in $\omega(r)$ for galaxies by a factor
of $\sim4$ from $z=3$ to $0.6$ at scales $>1~\mathrm{cMpc}/h$. The balance between competing physical
effects is scale dependant, leading to different conclusions at much smaller scales($\sim0.1~\mathrm{Mpc}/h$).
