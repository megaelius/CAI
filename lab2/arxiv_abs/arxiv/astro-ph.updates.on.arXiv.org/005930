We examine the gravitational collapse and black hole formation of multiple non--spherical configurations
constructed from Szekeres dust models with positive spatial curvature that smoothly match to a
Schwarzschild exterior. These configurations are made of an almost spherical central core region
surrounded by a network of "pancake-like" overdensities and voids with spatial positions prescribed
through standard initial conditions. We show that a full collapse into a focusing singularity,
without shell crossings appearing before the formation of an apparent horizon, is not possible
unless the full configuration becomes exactly or almost spherical. Seeking for black hole formation,
we demand that shell crossings are covered by the apparent horizon. This requires very special fine-tuned
initial conditions that impose very strong and unrealistic constraints on the total black hole
mass and full collapse time. As a consequence, non-spherical non-rotating dust sources cannot
furnish even minimally realistic toy models of black hole formation at astrophysical scales: demanding
realistic collapse time scales yields huge unrealistic black hole masses, while simulations of
typical astrophysical black hole masses collapse in unrealistically small times. We note, however,
that the resulting time--mass constraint is compatible with early Universe models of primordial
black hole formation, suitable in early dust-like environments. Finally, we argue that the shell
crossings appearing when non-spherical dust structures collapse are an indicator that such structures
do not form galactic mass black holes but virialise into stable stationary objects.
