Meteoroids impacting the Earth atmosphere are commonly classified using the PE criterion. This
criterion was introduced to support the identification of the fireball type by empirically linking
its orbital origin and composition characteristics. Additionally, it is used as an indicator of
the meteoroid tensile strength and its ability to penetrate the atmosphere. However, the level
of classification accuracy of the PE criterion depends on the ability to constrain the value of the
input data, retrieved from the fireball observation, required to derive the PE value. To overcome
these uncertainties and achieve a greater classification detail we propose a new formulation using
scaling laws and dimensionless variables that groups all the input variables into two parameters
that are directly obtained from the fireball observations. These two parameters, ${\alpha}$ and
${\beta}$, represent the drag and the mass loss rates along the luminous part of the trajectory,
respectively, and are linked to the shape, strength, ablation efficiency, mineralogical nature
of the projectile, and duration of the fireball. Thus, the new formulation relies on a physical basis.
This work shows the mathematical equivalence between the PE criterion and the logarithm of $2{\alpha}{\beta}$
under the same PE-criterion assumptions. We demonstrate that $log(2{\alpha}{\beta})$ offers
a more general formulation which does not require any preliminary constraint on the meteor flight
scenario and discuss the suitability of the new formulation for expanding the classification beyond
fully disintegrating fireballs to larger impactors including meteorite-dropping fireballs.
The reliability of the new formulation is validated using the Prairie Network meteor observations.
