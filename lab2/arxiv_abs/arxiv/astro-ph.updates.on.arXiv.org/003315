Among the competing evolution theories for sdB stars is the binary evolution scenario. EC 20117-4014
is a spectroscopic binary system consisting of a pulsating sdB star and an F5V star, however the period
and semimajor axis have not been precisely determined. To narrow down sdB binary evolution scenarios,
the orbital characteristics of the binary system were determined. This paper presents the photometric
results and orbital characteristics of the EC 20117-4014 binary system using 20 years of data. The
results show seasonal and day-to-day pulsation amplitude variations. The day-to-day pulsation
amplitude variation of the first largest amplitude pulsation (7.29 mHz) may be caused by a rotational
splitting. Periodic Observed minus Calculated (O-C) variations were detected in the two highest
amplitude pulsations identified in the EC 20117-4014 power spectrum, indicating the binary system's
precise orbital period (P = 794.6 days), orbital separation (r = 2.13 AU), and other orbital information.
This analysis indicated that the system is likely to have experienced binary evolution and lost
its hydrogen envelope through stable Roche lobe overflow, thus supporting a current leading hypotheses
for the origin of subdwarf B (sdB) stars. The residuals of O-C data points after fitting with the sine
curves shows small variations, which may imply an elliptical orbit or existence of other companions.
In addition to those results, the pulsation period change was obtained from the photometry data,
$\dot{P}$ = 5.4 ($\pm$0.7) $\times$ $10^{-14}$, which shows that this star is just before the ending
of the core burning phase.
