One of the fundamental assumptions of chemical evolution models (CEMs) of the Milky Way (MW) and
other spirals is that higher gas accretion rates are expected in the past, and in the inner regions
of the Galaxy. This leads to the so-called "inside-out disc formation scenario". Yet, these are
probably the most unconstrained inputs of such models. In the present paper, we aim at investigating
these main assumptions by studying how gas is accreted in four simulated MW-like galaxies assembled
within the $\Lambda$CDM scenario. The galaxies were obtained using two different simulation techniques,
cosmological setups and initial conditions. Two of them are MW candidates corresponding to the
chemodynamical model of Minchev et al. (2013, 2014) (known as MCM) and the Local Group cosmological
simulation of Nuza et al. (2014). We investigate vertical and radial gas accretion on to galaxy stellar
discs as a function of cosmic time and disc radius. We find that accretion in the MW-like galaxies
seem to happen in two distinct phases, namely: an early, more violent period; followed by a subsequent,
slowly declining phase. Our simulations seem to give support to the assumption that the amount of
gas incorporated into the MW disc exponentially decreases with time, leading to current net accretion
rates of $0.3-1\,$M$_\odot\,$yr$^{-1}$. In particular, accretion timescales on to the simulated
thin-disc-like structures are within $\sim5-7\,$Gyr, consistent with expectations from CEMs.
Moreover, our simulated MW discs are assembled from the inside-out with gas in the inner disc regions
accreted in shorter timescales than in external ones, in qualitative agreement with CEMs of the
Galaxy. However, this type of growth is not general to all galaxies and it is intimately linked to
their particular merger and gas accretion history.
