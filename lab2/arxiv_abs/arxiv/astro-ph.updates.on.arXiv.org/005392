Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) collimation has been inferred with the observations of achromatic steepening
in GRB light curves, known as jet breaks. Identifying a jet break from a GRB afterglow lightcurve
allows a measurement of the jet opening angle and true energetics of GRBs. In this paper, we reinvestigate
this problem using a large sample of GRBs that have an optical jet break which is consistent with being
achromatic in the X-ray band. Our sample includes 99 GRBs from February 1997 to March 2015 that have
optical and, for Swift GRBs, X-ray lightcurves that are consistent with the jet break interpretation.
Out of 99 GRBs we have studied, 55 GRBs are found to have temporal and spectral behaviors both before
and after the break consistent with the theoretical predictions of the jet break models, respectively.
These include 53 long/soft (Type II) and 2 short/hard (Type I) GRBs. Only 1 GRB is classified as the
candidate of a jet break with energy injection. Another 41 and 3 GRBs are classified as the candidates
with the lower and upper limits of the jet break time, respectively. The typical beaming correction
factor $f_b^{-1} \sim 1000$ for Type II GRBs, suggesting an even higher total GRB event rate density
in the universe. Both isotropic and jet-corrected energies have a wide span in their distributions.
We also investigate several empirical correlations (Amati, Frail, Ghirlanda and Liang-Zhang)
previously discussed in the literature. We find that in general most of these relations are less
tight than before. The existence of early jet breaks and hence small opening angle jets, which were
detected in the {\em Swfit era}, is most likely the source of scatter. If one limits the sample to jet
breaks later than $10^4$ s, the Liang-Zhang relation remains tight and the Ghirlanda relation still
exists. These relations are derived from Type II GRBs, and Type I GRBs usually deviate from them.
