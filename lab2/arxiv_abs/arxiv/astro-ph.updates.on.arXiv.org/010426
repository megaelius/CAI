We present observations of the CO isotopologues ($^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O) toward
the Galactic region with $169\arcdeg.75 \leqslant l \leqslant 174\arcdeg.75$ and $-0\arcdeg.75
\leqslant b \leqslant 0\arcdeg.5$, using the Purple Mountain Observatory 13.7~m millimeter-wavelength
telescope. Based on the $^{13}$CO~($J = 1-0$) data, we find five molecular clouds within the velocity
range between $-$25 and 8~km~s$^{-1}$ that are all characterized by conspicuous filamentary structures.
We have identified eight filaments with a length of 6.38--28.45~pc, a mean H$_2$ column density
of 0.70$\times$10$^{21}$--6.53$\times$10$^{21}$~cm$^{-2}$, and a line mass of 20.24--161.91~$M_\sun$
pc$^{-1}$, assuming a distance of $\sim$1.7~kpc. Gaussian fittings to the inner parts of the radial
density profiles lead to a mean FWHM width of 1.13$\pm$0.01~pc. The velocity structures of most
filaments present continuous distributions with slight velocity gradients. We find that turbulence
is the dominant internal pressure to support the fragmentation of filaments instead of thermal
pressure. Most filaments have virial parameters smaller than 2; thus, they are gravitationally
bound. Four filaments have an LTE line mass close to the virial line mass. We further extract dense
clumps using the $^{13}$CO data and find that 64$\%$ of the clumps are associated with the filaments.
According to the complementary IR data, most filaments have associated Class~II young stellar
objects. Class~I objects are mainly found to be located in the filaments with a virial parameter
close to 1. Within two virialized filaments, $^{12}$CO outflows have been detected, indicating
ongoing star-forming activity therein.
