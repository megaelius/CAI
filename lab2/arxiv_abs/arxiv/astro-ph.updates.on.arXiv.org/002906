Recently, the CIII] and CIV emission lines have been observed in galaxies in the early Universe ($z>5$),
providing new ways to measure their redshift and study their stellar populations and AGN. We explore
the first blind CII], CIII] and CIV survey ($z\sim0.68, 1.05, 1.53$, respectively) presented in
Stroe et al. (2017). We derive luminosity functions (LF) and study properties of CII], CIII] and
CIV line emitters through comparisons to the LFs of H$\alpha$ and Ly$\alpha$ emitters, UV selected
star forming (SF) galaxies and quasars at similar redshifts. The CII] LF at $z\sim0.68$ is equally
well described by a Schechter or a power-law LF, characteristic of a mixture of SF and AGN activity.
The CIII] LF ($z\sim1.05$) is consistent to a scaled down version of the Schechter H$\alpha$ and
Ly$\alpha$ LF at their redshift, indicating a SF origin. In stark contrast, the CIV LF at $z\sim1.53$
is well fit by a power-law, quasar-like LF. We find that the brightest UV sources ($M_{UV}<-22$)
will universally have CIII] and CIV emission. However, on average, CIII] and CIV are not as abundant
as H$\alpha$ or Ly$\alpha$ emitters at the same redshift, with cosmic average ratios of $\sim0.02-0.06$
to H$\alpha$ and $\sim0.01-0.1$ to intrinsic Ly$\alpha$. We predict that the CIII] and CIV lines
can only be truly competitive in confirming high redshift candidates when the hosts are intrinsically
bright and the effective Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction is below 1 per cent. While CIII] and CIV were
proposed as good tracers of young, relatively low-metallicity galaxies typical of the early Universe,
we find that, at least at $z\sim1.5$, CIV is exclusively hosted by AGN/quasars, especially at large
line equivalent widths.
