Post-AGB binaries are surrounded by circumbinary disks of gas and dust that are similar to protoplanetary
disks found around young stars. We aim to understand the structure of these disks and identify the
physical phenomena at play in their very inner regions. We want to understand the disk-binary interaction
and to further investigate the comparison with protoplanetary disks. We have conducted an interferometric
snapshot survey of 23 post-AGB binaries in the near-infrared (H-band) using VLTI/PIONIER. We have
fitted the multiwavelength visibilities and closure phases with purely geometrical models with
an increasing complexity in order to retrieve the sizes, temperatures and flux ratios of the different
components All sources are resolved and the different components contributing to the H-band flux
are dissected. The environment of these targets is very complex: 13/23 targets need models with
thirteen or more parameters to fit the data. We find that the inner disk rims follow and extend the
size-luminosity relation established for disks around young stars with an offset toward larger
sizes. The measured temperature of the near-infrared circumstellar emission of post-AGB binaries
is lower (Tsub~1200K) than for young stars, probably due to a different dust mineralogy and/or gas
density in the dust sublimation region. The dusty inner rims of the circumbinary disks around post-AGB
binaries are ruled by dust sublimation physics. Additionally, a significant amount of the circumstellar
H-band flux is over-resolved (14 targets have more than 10% of their non-stellar flux over-resolved)
hinting for more structure from a yet unknown origin (disk structure or outflow). The amount of over-resolved
flux is larger than around young stars. Due to the complexity of these targets, interferometric
imaging is a necessary tool to reveal the interacting inner regions in a model-independent way.
