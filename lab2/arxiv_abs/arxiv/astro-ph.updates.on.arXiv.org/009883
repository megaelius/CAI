Various instabilities have been proposed as a promising mechanism to accumulate dust. Moreover,
some of them are expected to lead to the multiple-ring structure formation and the planetesimal
formation in protoplanetary disks. In a turbulent gaseous disk, the growth of the instabilities
and the dust accumulation are quenched by turbulent diffusion of dust grains. The diffusion process
has been often modeled by a diffusion term in the continuity equation for the dust density. The dust
diffusion model, however, does not guarantee the angular momentum conservation in a disk. In this
study, we first formulate equations that describe the dust diffusion and also conserve the total
angular momentum of a disk. Second, we perform the linear perturbation analysis on the secular gravitational
instability (GI) using the equations. The results show that the secular GI is a monotonically growing
mode, contrary to the result of previous analyses that found it overstable. We find that the overstability
is caused by the non-conservation of the angular momentum. Third, we find a new axisymmetric instability
due to the combination of the dust-gas friction and the turbulent gas viscosity, which we refer to
as two-component viscous gravitational instability (TVGI). The most unstable wavelength of TVGI
is comparable to or smaller than the gas scale height. TVGI accumulates dust grains efficiently,
which indicates that TVGI is a promising mechanism for the formation of multiple-ring-like structures
and planetesimals. Finally, we examine the validity of the ring formation via the secular GI and
TVGI in the HL Tau disk and find both instabilities can create multiple rings whose width is about
10 au at orbital radii larger than 50 au.
