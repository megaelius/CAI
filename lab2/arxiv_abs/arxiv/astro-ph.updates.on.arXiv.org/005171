We use the Fisher information matrix to investigate the angular resolution and luminosity distance
uncertainty for coalescing binary neutron stars (BNSs) and neutron star-black hole binaries (NSBHs)
detected by the third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. Our study focuses on
an individual 3G detector and a network of up to four 3G detectors at different locations including
the US, Europe, China and Australia for the proposed Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer
(CE) detectors. We in particular examine the effect of the Earth's rotation, as GW signals from BNS
and low mass NSBH systems could be hours long for 3G detectors. We find that, a time-dependent antenna
beam-pattern function can help better localize BNS and NSBH sources, especially those edge-on
ones. The medium angular resolution for one ET-D detector is around 150 deg$^2$ for BNSs at a redshift
of $z=0.1$. The medium angular resolution for a network of two CE detectors in the US and Europe respectively
is around 20 deg$^2$ at $z=0.2$ for the simulated BNS and NSBH samples. While for a network of two ET-D
detectors, the similar angular resolution can be achieved at a much higher redshift of $z=0.5$.
The angular resolution of a network of three detectors is mainly determined by the baselines between
detectors regardless of the CE or ET detector type. We discuss the implications of our results to
constrain the Hubble constant $H_0$, the deceleration parameter $q_0$ and the equation-of-state
(EoS) of dark energy. We find that in general, if 10 BNSs or NSBHs at $z=0.1$ with known redshifts are
detected, $H_0$ can be measured with an accuracy of $0.9\%$. If 1000 face-on BNSs at $z<2$ are detected
with known redshifts, we are able to achieve $\Delta q_0=0.002$, or $\Delta w_0=0.03$ and $\Delta
w_a=0.2$ for dark energy.(Abridged version).
