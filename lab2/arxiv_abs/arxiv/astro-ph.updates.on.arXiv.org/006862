In order to develop and test a methodology to search for UV variability over the entire GALEX database
down to the shortest time scales, we analyzed time-domain photometry of $\sim5000$ light curves
of $\sim300$ bright $(m_{\rm{FUV}}, m_{\rm{NUV}} \leq 14)$ and blue $(m_{\rm{FUV}} - m_{\rm{NUV}}
< 0)$ GALEX sources. Using the \gphoton \ database tool, we discovered and characterized instrumentally-induced
variabilities in time-resolved GALEX photometry, which may severely impact automated searches
for short-period variations. The most notable artifact is a quasi-sinusoidal variation mimicking
light curves typical of pulsators, seen occasionally in either one or both detectors, with amplitudes
of up to 0.3 mag and periods corresponding to the periodicity of the spiral dithering pattern used
during the observation (P$\sim$120 sec). Therefore, the artifact may arise from small-scale response
variations. Other artifacts include visit-long "sagging" or "hump" in flux, occurring when the
dithering pattern is not a spiral, or a one-time change in flux level during the exposure. These instrumentally-caused
variations were not reported before, and are not due to known (and flagged) artifacts such as hot
spots, which can be easily eliminated. To characterize the frequency and causality of such artifacts,
we apply Fourier transform analysis to both light curves and dithering patterns, and examine whether
artificial brightness variations correlate with visit or instrumental parameters. Artifacts
do not correlate with source position on the detector. We suggest methods to identify artifact variations
and to correct them when possible.
