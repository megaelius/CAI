The fastest moving stars provide insight into several fundamental properties of the Galaxy, including
the escape velocity as a function of Galactocentric radius, the total mass, and the nature and frequency
of stellar encounters with the central supermassive black hole. The recent second data release
of Gaia has allowed the identification of new samples of stars with extreme velocities. Discrimination
among the possible origins of these stars is facilitated by chemical abundance information. We
here report the results from our high-resolution spectroscopic followup, using the Apache Point
Observatory, of five late-type `hypervelocity' star candidates, characterised by total Galactic
rest-frame velocities between 500-600 km/s and estimated to have a probability larger than 50%
to be unbound from the Milky Way. Our new results confirm the Gaia DR2 radial velocities to within
1 km/s. We derived stellar atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances for several species
including $\alpha$-elements (Mg, Ti, Si, Ca), Fe-peak elements (Fe, Ni, Co, Cr, Mn), neutron-capture
elements (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Nd, Eu) and odd-Z elements (Na, Al, K, V, Cu, Sc). We find that all stars
observed are metal-poor giants with -2 $\leq$ [Fe/H] $\leq$ -1 dex and are chemically indistinguishable
from typical halo stars. Our results are supported by the chemical properties of four additional
stars with extreme space motions which were observed by existing spectroscopic surveys. We conclude
that these stars are simply the high-velocity tail of the stellar halo and effectively rule out more
exotic origins such as from the Galactic centre or the Large Magellanic Cloud.
