We present an Environmental Control System (ECS) designed to achieve milliKelvin (mK) level temperature
stability for small-scale astronomical instruments. This ECS is inexpensive and is primarily
built from commercially available components. The primary application for our ECS is the high-precision
Doppler spectrometer MINERVA-Red, where the thermal variations of the optical components within
the instrument represent a major source of systematic error. We demonstrate $\pm 2$ mK temperature
stability within a 0.5 m$^{3}$ Thermal Enclosure using resistive heaters in conjunction with a
commercially available PID controller and off-the-shelf thermal sensors. The enclosure is maintained
above ambient temperature, enabling rapid cooling through heat dissipation into the surrounding
environment. We demonstrate peak-to-valley (PV) temperature stability of better than 5 mK within
the MINERVA-Red vacuum chamber, which is located inside the Thermal Enclosure, despite large temperature
swings in the ambient laboratory environment. During periods of stable laboratory conditions,
the PV variations within the vacuum chamber are less than 3 mK. This temperature stability is comparable
to the best stability demonstrated for Doppler spectrometers currently achieving 1 m s$^{-1}$
radial velocity precision. We discuss the challenges of using commercially available thermoelectrically
cooled CCD cameras in a temperature-stabilized environment, and demonstrate that the effects
of variable heat output from the CCD camera body can be mitigated using PID-controlled chilled water
systems. The ECS presented here could potentially provide the stable operating environment required
for future compact, "astro-photonic" precise radial velocity (PRV) spectrometers to achieve
high Doppler measurement precision with a modest budget.
