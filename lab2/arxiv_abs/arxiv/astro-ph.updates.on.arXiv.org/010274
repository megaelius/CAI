In this work we study how the input data cadence affects the photospheric energy and helicity injection
estimates in eruptive NOAA active region 11158. We sample the novel 2.25-minute vector magnetogram
and Dopplergram data from the \emph{Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager} (HMI) instrument onboard
the \emph{Solar Dynamics Observatory} (SDO) spacecraft to create input datasets of variable cadences
ranging from 2.25 minutes to 24 hours. We employ state-of-the-art data processing, velocity and
electric field inversion methods for deriving estimates of the energy and helicity injections
from these datasets. We find that the electric field inversion methods that reproduce the observed
magnetic field evolution through the use of Faraday's law are more stable against variable cadence:
the PDFI (PTD-Doppler-FLCT-Ideal) electric field inversion method produces consistent injection
estimates for cadences from 2.25 minutes up to 2 hours, implying that the photospheric processes
acting on time scales below 2 hours contribute little to the injections, or that they are below the
sensitivity of the input data and the PDFI method. On other hand, the electric field estimate derived
from the output of DAVE4VM (Differential Affine Velocity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms),
which does not fulfil Faraday's law exactly, produces significant variations in the energy and
helicity injection estimates in the 2.25-minute to 2-hour cadence range. We present also a third,
novel DAVE4VM-based electric field estimate, which corrects the poor inductivity of the raw DAVE4VM
estimate. This method is less sensitive to the changes of cadence, but still faces significant issues
for the lowest of considered cadences ($\geq$2 hours). We find several potential problems in both
PDFI- and DAVE4VM-based injection estimates and conclude that the quality of both should be surveyed
further in controlled environments.
