Implicit Monte Carlo (IMC) and Discrete Diffusion Monte Carlo (DDMC) are methods used to stochastically
solve the radiative transport and diffusion equations, respectively. These methods combine into
a hybrid transport-diffusion method we refer to as IMC-DDMC. We explore a multigroup IMC-DDMC scheme
that, in DDMC, combines frequency groups with sufficient optical thickness. We term this procedure
"opacity regrouping". Opacity regrouping has previously been applied to IMC-DDMC calculations
for problems in which the dependence of the opacity on frequency is monotonic. We generalize opacity
regrouping to non-contiguous groups and implement this in \supernu, a code designed to do radiation
transport in high-velocity outflows with non-monotonic opacities. We find that regrouping of
non-contiguous opacity groups generally improves the speed of IMC-DDMC radiation transport.
We present an asymptotic analysis that informs the nature of the Doppler shift in DDMC groups and
summarize the derivation of the Gentile-Fleck factor for modified IMC-DDMC. We test \supernu\
using numerical experiments including a quasi-manufactured analytic solution, a simple ten-group
problem, and the W7 problem for Type Ia supernovae. We find that the opacity regrouping is necessary
to make our IMC-DDMC implementation feasible for the W7 problem and possibly Type Ia supernova simulations
in general. We compare the bolometric light curves and spectra produced by the \supernu\ and \phoenix\
radiation transport codes for the W7 problem. The overall shape of the bolometric light curves are
in good agreement, as are the spectra and their evolution with time. However, for the numerical specifications
we considered, we find that the peak luminosity of the light curve calculated using \supernu\ is
$\sim$10\% less than that calculated using \phoenix.
