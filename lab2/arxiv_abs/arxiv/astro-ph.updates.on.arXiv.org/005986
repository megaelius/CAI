We explore the ability of gravitational-wave detectors to extract the redshift distribution of
binary black hole (BBH) mergers. The evolution of the merger rate across redshifts $0 < z \lesssim
1$ is directly tied to the formation and evolutionary processes. In particular, measuring this
redshift dependence will provide insight regarding the progenitor formation rate together with
the distribution of time delays between formation and merger. Because the limiting distance to
which BBHs can be detected depends on the masses of the binary, the redshift distribution of detected
binaries depends on their underlying mass distribution. We therefore consider the mass and redshift
distributions simultaneously, and fit the merger rate density, ${dN}/{dm_1\,dm_2\,dz}$, as
a function of the redshift and component masses. Our constraints on the mass distribution agree
with previously published results, including evidence for an upper mass cutoff at $\sim 40 \ M_\odot$.
Additionally, we show that the current set of six BBH detections are consistent with a merger rate
density which is uniform in comoving volume. Although our constraints on the redshift distribution
are not yet tight enough to distinguish between BBH formation channels, we show that it will be possible
to distinguish between different astrophysically-motivated models of the merger rate evolution
with $\sim$100--300 LIGO-Virgo detections (to be expected within 2--5 years). Specifically,
we will be able to infer whether the formation rate peaks at higher or lower redshifts than the SFR,
or whether the typical delay time between formation and merger is short or long. Meanwhile, with
$\sim 100$ detections, the inferred redshift distribution will place constraints on more exotic
scenarios such as modified gravity.
