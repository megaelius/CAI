As astronomical observations from space benefit from improved sensitivity, the effectiveness
of scientific programs is becoming limited by systematics that often originate in poorly understood
image sensor behavior. Traditional, bottom-up detector characterization methods provide one
way to model underlying detector physics, and generate ever more faithful numerical simulations,
but this approach is vulnerable to preconceptions and over-simplification. The alternative top-down
approach is laboratory emulation, which enables observation, calibration, and analysis scenarios
to be tested without relying on a complete understanding of the underlying physics. This complements
detector characterization and simulation efforts by testing their validity. We describe a laboratory
facility and experimental testbed that supports the emulation of a wide range of mission concepts
such as gravitational weak lensing measurements by WFIRST and high precision spectrophotometry
of transiting exoplanets by JWST. An Offner relay projects readily customizable "scenes" (e.g.
stars, galaxies, spectra) with very low optical aberration over the full area of a typical optical
or near infrared image sensor. f/8 and slower focal ratios may be selected, spanning those of most
proposed space missions and approximating the point spread function (PSF) size of seeing limited
ground based surveys. Diffraction limited PSFs are projected over a wide field of view and wavelength
range to deliver highly predictable image patterns down to sub-pixel scales with stable intensity
and fine motion control. The testbed enables realistic validation of detector performance on science-like
images, which aids mission design and survey strategy, as well as targeted investigations of various
detector effects.
