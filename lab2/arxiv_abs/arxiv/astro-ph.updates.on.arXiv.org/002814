We present an analysis of the HI and CO gas in conjunction with the Planck/IRAS submillimeter/far-infrared
dust properties toward the most outstanding high latitude clouds MBM 53, 54, 55 and HLCG 92-35 at
b = -30 deg to -45 deg. The CO emission, dust opacity at 353 GHz (tau353), and dust temperature (Td)
show generally good spatial correspondence. On the other hand, the correspondence between the
HI emission and the dust properties is less clear than in CO. The integrated HI intensity WHI and tau353
show a large scatter with a correlation coefficient of ~0.6 for a Td range from 16 K to 22 K. We find,
however, that WHI and tau353 show better correlation for smaller ranges of Td every 0.5 K, generally
with a correlation coefficient of 0.7-0.9. We set up a hypothesis that the HI gas associated with
the highest Td >= 21.5 K is optically thin, whereas the HI emission is generally optically thick
for Td lower than 21.5 K. We have determined a relationship for the optically thin HI gas between atomic
hydrogen column density and tau353, NHI (cm-2) = (1.5 x 10^26) x tau353, under the assumption that
the dust properties are uniform and we have applied this to estimate NHI from tau353 for the whole
cloud. NHI was then used to solve for Ts and tauHI over the region. The result shows that the HI is dominated
by optically thick gas having a low spin temperature of 20-40 K and a density of 40-160 cm-3. The HI
envelope has a total mass of ~1.2 x 10^4 Msol, an order of magnitude larger than that of the CO clouds.
The HI envelope properties derived by this method do not rule out a mixture of HI and H2 in the dark gas,
but we present indirect evidence that most of the gas mass is in the atomic state.
