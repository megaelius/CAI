The Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) provided an unprecedented volume of precise astrometric and excellent
photometric data. In terms of data mining the Gaia catalogue, machine learning methods have shown
to be a powerful tool to, for instance, search for hitherto unknown stellar structures. Particularly,
supervised and unsupervised learning methods combined together allow to significantly improve
the detection of open clusters. We systematically scan Gaia DR2 in a region covering the Galactic
anticentre and the Perseus arm (120<=l<=205 and -10<=b<=10), with the goal of populating this region
with open clusters and fine tuning the methodology, proposed in arXiv:1805.03045v2 and successfully
applied to TGAS data, adapting it to different density regions. Our methodology uses an unsupervised,
density based, clustering algorithm, DBSCAN, that identifies over-densities in the five dimensional
astrometric parameter space (l,b,\varpi,\mu_{\alpha^*},\mu_{\delta}) that may correspond
to physical clusters. The over-densities are separated into physical clusters (open clusters)
or random statistical clusters using an artificial neural network to recognise the isochrone pattern
that open clusters show in a colour magnitude diagram. The method is able to recover more than 75%
of the open clusters confirmed in the search area. Moreover, we are able to detect 58 open clusters
unknown previous to Gaia DR2, which represent an increase of around 25% with respect to the already
catalogued ones in this region. We find that the census of nearby open clusters is not complete. Different
machine learning based methodologies for a blind search of open clusters are complementary to each
other, with no single method being able to detect the 100% of the existing groups. Our methodology
has shown to be a reliable tool for the automatic detection of open clusters, designed to be applied
to the full Gaia DR2 catalogue.
