Synthetic photometry is a great tool for studying globular clusters, especially for understanding
the nature of their multiple populations. Our goal is to quantify the errors on synthetic photometry
that are caused by uncertainties on stellar and observational/calibration parameters. These
errors can be taken into account when building synthetic color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) that
are to be compared to observed CMDs. We have computed atmosphere models and synthetic spectra for
two stars, Pollux and Procyon, that have stellar parameters typical of turn-off and bottom red giant
branch stars in globular clusters. We then varied the effective temperature, surface gravity,
microturbulence, the carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen abundances, and [Fe/H]. We quantified the effect
on synthetic photometry in the following filters: Johnson UBVRI and HST F275W, F336W, F410M, F438W,
F555W, F606W, and F814W. We estimated the effects of extinction, atmospheric correction, and of
the Vega reference spectrum on the resulting photometry. We tested the ability of our models to reproduce
the observed spectral energy distribution and observed photometry of the two stars. We show that
variations are generally stronger in blue filters. Dispersions on synthetic colors due to uncertainties
on stellar parameters vary between less than 0.01 and to 0.04 magnitude, depending on the choice
of filters. Uncertainties on the zero points, the extinction law, or the atmospheric correction
affect the resulting colors at a level of a few 0.01 magnitudes in a systematic way. The models reproduce
the flux-calibrated spectral energy distribution of both stars well. Comparison between synthetic
and observed UBVRI photometry shows a variable degree of (dis)agreement. The observed differences
likely indicate that different calibration processes are performed to obtain respectively observed
and synthetic photometry.
