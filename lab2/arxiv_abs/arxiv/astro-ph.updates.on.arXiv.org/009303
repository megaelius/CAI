Context- S stars are late-type giants with spectra showing characteristic molecular bands of ZrO
in addition to the TiO bands typical of M stars. Their overabundance pattern shows the signature
of s-process nucleosynthesis. Intrinsic, technetium (Tc)-rich S stars are the first objects,
on the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB), to undergo third dredge-up (TDU) events. Gaia exquisite parallaxes
now allow to precisely locate these stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. Here we report
on a population of low-mass, Tc-rich S stars, previously unaccounted for by stellar evolution models.
Aims- Our aim is to derive parameters of a sample of low-mass Tc-rich S stars and then, by comparing
their location in the HR diagram with stellar evolution tracks, to derive their masses and to compare
their measured s-process abundance profiles with recently derived STAREVOL nucleosynthetic
predictions for low-mass AGB stars. Methods- The stellar parameters were obtained using a combination
of HERMES high-resolution spectra, accurate Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia-DR2) parallaxes, stellar-evolution
models and newly-designed MARCS model atmospheres for S-type stars. Results- We report on 6 Tc-rich
S stars lying close to the 1 Msun (initial mass) tracks of AGB stars of the corresponding metallicity
and above the predicted onset of TDU, as expected. This provides direct evidence for TDUs occurring
in AGB stars with initial masses as low as ~ 1 Msun and at low luminosity, i.e. at the start of the thermally-pulsing
AGB. We present AGB models producing TDU in those stars with [Fe/H] in the range -0.25 to -0.5. There
is a reasonable agreement between the measured and predicted s-process abundance profiles. For
2 objects however (CD -29 5912 and BD +34 1698), the predicted C/O ratio and s-process enhancements
do not match simultaneously the measured ones.
