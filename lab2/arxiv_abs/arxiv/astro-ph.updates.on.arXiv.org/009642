Regolith on Mars exchanges water with the atmosphere on a diurnal basis and this process causes significant
variation in the abundance of water vapor at the surface. While previous studies of regolith-atmosphere
exchange focus on the abundance, recent in-situ experiments and remote sensing observations measure
the isotopic composition of the atmospheric water. We are therefore motivated to investigate isotopic
water exchange between the atmosphere and the regolith and determine its effect on the deuterium
to hydrogen ratio (D/H) of the atmosphere. We model transport of water in the regolith and regolith-atmosphere
exchange by solving a transport equation including regolith adsorption, condensation, and diffusion.
The model calculates equilibrium fractionation between HDO and H2O in each of these processes.
The fractionation in adsorption is caused by the difference in the latent heat of adsorption, and
that of condensation is caused by the difference in the vapor pressure. Together with a simple, bulk-aerodynamic
boundary layer model, we simulate the diurnal variation of the D/H near the planetary surface. We
find that the D/H can vary by 300 - 1400 per mil diurnally in the equatorial and mid-latitude locations,
and the magnitude is greater at a colder location or season. The variability is mainly driven by adsorption
and desorption of regolith particles, and its diurnal trend features a drop in the early morning,
a rise to the peak value during the daytime, and a second drop in the late afternoon and evening, tracing
the water vapor flow into and out from the regolith. The predicted D/H variation can be tested with
in-situ measurements. As such, our calculations suggest stable isotope analysis to be a powerful
tool in pinpointing regolith-atmosphere exchange of water on Mars.
