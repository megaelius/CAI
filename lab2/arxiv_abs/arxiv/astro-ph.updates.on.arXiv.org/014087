We use the Simba cosmological hydrodynamic simulation suite to explore the impact of feedback on
the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and intergalactic medium (IGM) around $2 \leq z \leq 3$ quasars.
We identify quasars in Simba as the most rapidly-accreting black holes, and show that they are well-matched
in bolometric luminosity and correlation strength to real quasars. We extract Lyman-alpha (Ly-a)
absorption in spectra passing at different transverse distances (10 kpc $\lesssim b \lesssim$
10 Mpc) around those quasars, and compare to observations of the mean Ly-a absorption profile. The
observations are well reproduced, except within 100 kpc from the foreground quasar, where Simba
overproduces absorption; this could potentially be mitigated by including ionisation from the
quasar itself. By comparing runs with different feedback modules activated, we find that (mechanical)
AGN feedback has little impact on the surrounding CGM even around these most highly luminous black
holes, while stellar feedback has a significant impact. By further investigating thermodynamic
and kinematic properties of CGM gas, we find that stellar feedback, and not AGN feedback, is the primary
physical driver in determining the average properties of the CGM around $z\sim 2-3$ quasars. We
also compare our results with previous works, and find that Simba predicts much more absorption
within 100 kpc than the Nyx and Illustris simulations, showing that the Ly-a absorption profile
can be a powerful constraint on simulations. Instruments such as VLT-MUSE and upcoming surveys
(e.g., WEAVE and DESI) promise to further improve such constraints.
