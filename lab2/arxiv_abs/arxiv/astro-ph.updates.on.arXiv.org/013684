Following an established protocol of science, that results must be reproducible, we examine the
Gaussian fits to Galactic 21-cm emission profiles obtained by two seemingly complementary methods:
the semi-automated approach based on the method used by Verschuur (2004) and the automated technique
of Nidever et al. (2008). Both methods use data from the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn all-sky survey.
The appeal of an automated routine is great, if for no other reason than the time saved over semi-automated
fits. The pitfalls, however, are often unanticipated, and the most important aspect of any algorithm
is the reproducibility of the results. The comparisons led to the identification of four problems
with the Nidever et al. (2008) analysis: (1) different methods of calculating the reduced chi-squared
measuring the goodness of fit; (2) an ultra-broad component found bridging the gap between low and
intermediate velocity gas; (3) the lack of an imposed spatial coherence allowing different components
to appear and disappear in profiles separated by a fraction of a beam width; and (4) multiple, fundamentally
different solutions for the profiles at both the North and South Galactic Poles. A two-step method
would improve the algorithm, where an automated fit is followed by a quality-assurance, visual
inspection. Confirming evidence emerges from this study of a pervasive component with a line width
of order 34 km/s, which may be explained by the Critical Ionization Velocity (CIV) of helium. Since
the Nidever et al. (2008) paper contains the only result in the refereed literature that contradicts
the CIV model, it is important to understand the flaws in the analysis that let to this contradiction.
