With TESS and ground-based surveys searching for rocky exoplanets around cooler, nearby stars,
the number of Earth-sized exoplanets that are well-suited for atmospheric follow-up studies will
increase significantly. For atmospheric characterization, the James Webb Space Telescope will
only be able to target a small fraction of the most interesting systems, and the usefulness of ground-based
observatories will remain limited by a range of effects related to Earth's atmosphere. Here, we
explore a new method for ground-based exoplanet atmospheric characterization that relies on simultaneous,
differential, ultra-narrow-band photometry. The instrument uses a narrow-band interference
filter and an optical design that enables simultaneous observing over two 0.3 nm wide bands spaced
1 nm apart. We consider the capabilities of this instrument in the case where one band is centered
on an oxygen-free continuum region while the other band overlaps the 760 nm oxygen band head in the
transmission spectrum of the exoplanet, which can be accessible from Earth in systems with large
negative line-of-sight velocities. We find that M9 and M4 dwarfs that meet this radial velocity
requirement will be the easiest targets but must be nearby (<8 pc) and will require the largest upcoming
Extremely Large Telescopes. The oxyometer instrument design is simple and versatile and could
be adapted to enable the study of a wide range of atmospheric species. We demonstrate this by building
a prototype oxyometer and present its design and a detection of a 50 ppm simulated transit signal
in the laboratory. We also present data from an on-sky test of a prototype oxyometer, demonstrating
the ease of use of the compact instrument design.
