The Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S) mission aims to explore two most spectacular
eruptions in the Sun: solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and their magnetism. For the
studies of CMEs, the payload Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope (LST) has been proposed. It includes a
traditional white-light coronagraph and a Lyman-alpha coronagraph which opens a new window to
CME observations. Polarization measurements taken by white-light coronagraphs are crucial to
derive fundamental physical parameters of CMEs. To make such measurements, there are two options
of Stokes polarimeter which have been used by existing white-light coronagraphs for space missions.
One uses a single or triple linear polarizers, the other involves both a half-wave plate and a linear
polarizer. We find that the former option subjects to less uncertainty in the derived Stokes vector
propagated from detector noise. The latter option involves two plates which are prone to internal
reflections and may have a reduced transmission factor. Therefore, the former option is adopted
as our Stokes polarimeter scheme for LST. Based on the parameters of the intended linear polarizer(s)
colorPol provided by CODIXX and the half-wave plate 2-APW-L2-012C by Altechna, it is further shown
that the imperfect maximum transmittance of the polarizer significantly increases the variance
amplification of Stokes vector by at least about 50% when compared with the ideal case. The relative
errors of Stokes vector caused by the imperfection of colorPol polarizer and the uncertainty due
to the polarizer assembling in the telescope are estimated to be about 5%. Among the considered parameters,
we find that the dominant error comes from the uncertainty in the maximum transmittance of the polarizer.
