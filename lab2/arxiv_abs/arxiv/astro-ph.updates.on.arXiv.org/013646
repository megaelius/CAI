The streaming instability for solid particles in protoplanetary disks is re-examined assuming
the familiar alpha ($\alpha$) model for isotropic turbulence. Turbulence always reduces the growth
rates of the streaming instability relative to values calculated for globally laminar disks. While
for small values of the turbulence parameter, $\alpha < 10^{-5}$, the wavelengths of the fastest-growing
disturbances are small fractions of the local gas vertical scale height $H$, we find that for moderate
values of the turbulence parameter, i.e., $\alpha \sim 10^{-5}-10^{-3}$, the lengthscales of
maximally growing disturbances shift toward larger scales, approaching $H$. At these moderate
turbulent intensities and for local particle to gas mass density ratios $\epsilon < 0.5$, the vertical
scales of the most unstable modes begin to exceed the corresponding radial scales so that the instability
appears in the form of vertically oriented sheets extending well beyond the particle scale height.
We find that for hydrodynamical turbulent disk models reported in the literature, with $\alpha
= 4\times 10^{-5} - 5\times 10^{-4}$, together with state of the art global evolution models of particle
growth, the streaming instability is predicted to be viable within a narrow triangular patch of
$\alpha$--$\tau_s$ parameter space centered on Stokes numbers, $\tau_s \sim 0.01$ and $\alpha
\sim 4\times 10^{-5}$ and, further, exhibits growth rates on the order of several hundred to thousands
of orbit times for disks with 1 percent ($Z= 0.01$) cosmic solids abundance or metallicity. Our results
are consistent with, and place in context, published numerical studies of streaming instabilities.
