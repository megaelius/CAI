We present two self-consistent procedures that couple the hydrodynamics with calculations of
the line-force in the frame of radiation wind theory. These procedures give us the line-force parameters,
the velocity field, and the mass-loss rate. The first one is based on the so-called m-CAK theory.
A full set of line-force parameters for $T_\text{eff}\ge 32,000$ K and surface gravities higher
than 3.4 dex for two different metallicities are presented, along with their corresponding wind
parameters. We find that the dependence of line-force parameters on effective temperature is enhanced
by the dependence on $\log g$. For the case of homogeneous winds (without clumping) comparison of
self-consistent mass-loss rates shows a good agreement with empirical values. We also consider
self-consistent wind solutions that are used as input in FASTWIND to calculate synthetic spectra.
By comparison with the observed spectra for three stars with clumped winds, we found that varying
the clumping factor the synthetic spectra rapidly converge into the neighbourhood region of the
solution. Therefore, this self-consistent m-CAK procedure significantly reduces the number
of free parameters needed to obtain a synthetic spectrum. The second procedure (called Lambert-procedure)
provides a self-consistent solution beyond m-CAK theory, and line-acceleration is calculated
by the full NLTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN. Both the mass-loss rate and the clumping factor
are set as free parameters, hence their values are obtained by spectral fitting after the respective
self-consistent hydrodynamics is calculated. Since performing the Lambert-procedure requires
significant computational power, the analysis is made only for the star z-Puppis. The promising
results gives a positive balance about the future applications for the self-consistent solutions
presented on this thesis.
