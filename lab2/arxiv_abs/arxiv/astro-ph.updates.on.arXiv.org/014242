ASTERIA (Arcsecond Space Telescope Enabling Research In Astrophysics) is a 6U CubeSat space telescope
(10 cm x 20 cm x 30 cm, 10 kg). ASTERIA's primary mission objective was demonstrating two key technologies
for reducing systematic noise in photometric observations: high-precision pointing control
and high-stabilty thermal control. ASTERIA demonstrated 0.5 arcsecond RMS pointing stability
and $\pm$10 milliKelvin thermal control of its camera payload during its primary mission, a significant
improvement in pointing and thermal performance compared to other spacecraft in ASTERIA's size
and mass class. ASTERIA launched in August 2017 and deployed from the International Space Station
(ISS) November 2017. During the prime mission (November 2017 -- February 2018) and the first extended
mission that followed (March 2018 - May 2018), ASTERIA conducted opportunistic science observations
which included collection of photometric data on 55 Cancri, a nearby exoplanetary system with a
super-Earth transiting planet. The 55 Cancri data were reduced using a custom pipeline to correct
CMOS detector column-dependent gain variations. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach was
used to simultaneously detrend the photometry using a simple baseline model and fit a transit model.
ASTERIA made a marginal detection of the known transiting exoplanet 55 Cancri e ($\sim2$~\Rearth),
measuring a transit depth of $374\pm170$ ppm. This is the first detection of an exoplanet transit
by a CubeSat. The successful detection of super-Earth 55 Cancri e demonstrates that small, inexpensive
spacecraft can deliver high-precision photometric measurements.
