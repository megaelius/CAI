The centaur (2060) Chiron has exhibited outgassing behaviour and possibly hosts a ring system.
On 2011 November 29, Chiron occulted a fairly bright star (R approximately 15 mag) as observed from
the 3-m NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea and the 2-m Faulkes Telescope North
(FTN) at Haleakala. Data were taken as visible wavelength images and simultaneous, low-resolution,
near-infrared (NIR) spectra. Here, we present a detailed examination of the light-curve features
in the optical data and an analysis of the near-infrared spectra. We place a lower limit on the diameter
of Chiron's nucleus of 160.2+/-1.3 km. Sharp, narrow dips were observed between 280-360 km from
the centre (depending on event geometry). For a central chord and assumed ring plane, the separated
features are 298.5 to 302 and 308 to 310.5 km from the nucleus, with normal optical depth approximately
0.3-0.5, and a gap of 9.1+/-1.3 km. These features are similar in equivalent depth to Chariklo's
inner ring. The absence of absorbing or scattering material near the nucleus suggests that these
sharp dips are more likely to be planar rings than a shell of material. The region of relatively-increased
transmission is within the 1:2 spin-orbit resonance, which is consistent with the proposed clearing
pattern for a non-axisymmetric nucleus. Characteristics of additional, azimuthally incomplete
features are presented, which are likely to be transient, as well as detection of an extended shell
or diffuse ring from approximately 900-1500 km. There are no significant features in the NIR light
curves, nor any correlation between optical features and NIR spectral slope.
