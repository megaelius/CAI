We present a large, comprehensive survey of rovibrational CO line emission at 4.7 micron from 69
protoplanetary disks, obtained with CRIRES on the ESO Very Large Telescope at the highest available
spectral resolving power (R=95,000, v=3.2 km/s). The CO fundamental band (Delta v=1) is a well-known
tracer of warm gas in the inner, planet-forming regions of gas-rich disks around young stars, with
the lines formed in the super-heated surfaces of the disks at radii of 0.1-10 AU. Our high spectral
resolution data provide new insight into the kinematics of the inner disk gas. Pure double-peaked
Keplerian profiles are surprisingly uncommon, beyond the frequency expected based on disk inclination.
The majority of the profiles are consistent with emission from a disk plus a slow (few km/s) molecular
disk wind. This is evidenced by analysis of different categories as well as an overall tendency for
line profiles to have excess blue emission. Weak emission lines from isotopologues and vibrationally
excited levels are readily detected. In general, 13CO lines trace cooler gas than the bulk 12CO emission
and may arise from further out in the disk, as indicated by narrower line profiles. A high fraction
of the sources show vibrationally excited emission (~50%) which is correlated with accretion luminosity,
consistent with ultra-violet (UV) fluorescent excitation. Disks around early-type Herbig AeBe
stars have narrower lines, on average, than their lower-mass late-type counterparts, due to their
increased luminosity. Evolutionary changes in CO are also seen. Removal of the protostellar envelope
between class I and II results in the disappearance of the strong absorption lines and CO ice feature
characteristic of class I spectra. However, CO emission from class I and II objects is similar in
detection frequency, excitation and line shape, indicating that inner disk characteristics are
established early.
