Two fundamental properties of stellar magnetic fields have been determined by observations for
solar-like stars with different Rossby numbers (Ro), namely, the magnetic field strength and the
magnetic cycle period. The field strength exhibits two regimes: 1) for fast rotation it is independent
of Ro, 2) for slow rotation it decays with Ro following a power law. For the magnetic cycle period two
regimes of activity, the active and inactive branches, also have been identified. For both of them,
the longer the rotation period, the longer the activity cycle. Using global dynamo simulations
of solar like stars with Rossby numbers between ~0.4 and ~2, this paper explores the relevance of
rotational shear layers in determining these observational properties. Our results, consistent
with non-linear alpha^2-Omega dynamos, show that the total magnetic field strength is independent
of the rotation period. Yet at surface levels, the origin of the magnetic field is determined by Ro.
While for Ro<1 it is generated in the convection zone, for Ro>1 strong toroidal fields are generated
at the tachocline and rapidly emerge towards the surface. In agreement with the observations, the
magnetic cycle period increases with the rotational period. However, a bifurcation is observed
for Ro~1, separating a regime where oscillatory dynamos operate mainly in the convection zone,
from the regime where the tachocline has a predominant role. In the latter the cycles are believed
to result from the periodic energy exchange between the dynamo and the magneto-shear instabilities
developing in the tachocline and the radiative interior.
