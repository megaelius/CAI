We present a self-consistent model for the tidal evolution of circumbinary planets. Based on the
weak-friction model, we derive expressions of the resulting forces and torques considering complete
tidal interactions between all the bodies of the system. Although the tidal deformation suffered
by each extended mass must take into account the combined gravitational effects of the other two
bodies, the only tidal forces that have a net effect on the dynamic are those that are applied on the
same body that exerts the deformation, as long as no mean-motion resonance exists between the masses.
We apply the model to the Kepler-38 binary system. The evolution of the spin equations shows that
the planet reaches a stationary solution much faster than the stars, and the equilibrium spin frequency
is sub-synchronous. The binary components evolve on a longer timescale, reaching a super-synchronous
solution very close to that derived for the 2-body problem. After reaching spin stationarity, the
eccentricity is damped in all bodies and for all the parameters analyzed here. A similar effect is
noted for the binary separation. The semimajor axis of the planet, on the other hand, may migrate
inwards or outwards, depending on the masses and orbital parameters. In some cases the secular evolution
of the system may also exhibit an alignment of the pericenters, requiring to include additional
terms in the tidal model. Finally, we derived analytical expressions for the variational equations
of the orbital evolution and spin rates based on low-order elliptical expansions in the semimajor
axis ratio and the eccentricities. These are found to reduce to the 2-body case when one of the masses
is taken equal to zero. This model allow us to find a close and simple analytical expression for the
stationary spin rates of all the bodies, as well as predicting the direction and magnitude of the
orbital migration.
