The continued operation of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) combined with several
ground-based optical transient surveys (e.g., CRTS, ASAS-SN and PTF) offer an unprecedented opportunity
to explore the dust structures in luminous AGNs. We use these data for a mid-IR dust reverberation
mapping (RM) study of 87 archetypal Palomar-Green quasars at $z\lesssim0.5$. To cope with various
contaminations of the photometry data and the sparse time sampling of the light curves, procedures
to combine these datasets and retrieve the dust RM signals have been developed. We find $\sim$70%
of the sample (with a completeness correction, up to 95%) have convincing mid-IR time-lags in the
WISE W1 ($\sim3.4~\mu m$) and W2 ($\sim4.5~\mu m$) bands and they are proportional to the square
root of the AGN luminosity. Combined with previous K-band ($\sim2.2~\mu m$) RM results in the literature,
the inferred dust emission size ratios are $R_{K}:R_{W1}:R_{W2}=0.6:1:1.2$. Under simple assumptions,
we put preliminary constraints on the projected dust surface density at these bands and reveal the
possibly different torus structures among hot-dust-deficient, warm-dust-deficient and normal
quasars from the reverberation signals. With multi-epoch Spitzer data and later WISE photometry,
we also explore AGN IR variability at 10--24 $\mu m$ over a 5-year time-scale. Except for blazars
and flat-spectrum radio sources, the majority of AGNs have typical variation amplitudes at 24 $\mu
m$ no more than 10% of that in the W1 band, indicating the dust reverberation signals damp out quickly
at longer wavelengths. In particular, steep-spectrum radio quasars also lack strong 24 $\mu m$
variability, consistent with the unification picture of radio-loud AGN.
