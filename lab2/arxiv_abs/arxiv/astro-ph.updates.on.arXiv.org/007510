The X-ray afterglow plateau emission observed in many Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) has been interpreted
as either being fueled by fallback onto a newly formed black hole, or by the spin-down luminosity
of an ultra-magnetized millisecond neutron star. If the latter model is assumed, GRB X-ray afterglow
light curves can be analytically reproduced. We fit a sample of GRB X-ray plateaus, interestingly
yielding a distribution in the magnetic field versus spin period (B-P) diagram consistent with
$B\propto P^{7/6}$. This is expected from the well-established physics of the spin-up line minimum
period for Galactic millisecond pulsars. The normalisation of the relation we obtain perfectly
matches spin-up line predictions for the expected masses ($\sim 1 M_{\odot}$) and radii ($\sim
10 {\rm ~km}$) of newly born magnetars, and mass accretion rates consistent with GRB expectations
of $10^{-4} M_{\odot}/{\rm s} <\dot{M}< 10^{-1} M_{\odot}/{\rm s}$. Short GRBs with extended
emission (SEE) appear towards the high period end of the distribution, while the long GRBs (LGRBs)
towards the short period end. This result is consistent with spin-up limit expectations where the
total accreted mass determines the position of the neutron star in the B-P diagram. The P-B distribution
for LGRBs and SEE are statistically different, further supporting the idea that the fundamental
plane relation \citep{dainotti16c,Dainotti2017} is a powerful discriminant among those populations.
Our conclusions are robust against suppositions regarding the GRB collimation angle and magnetar
breaking index, which shifts the resulting magnetar properties parallel to the spin-up line, and
strongly support a magnetar origin for GRBs presenting X-ray plateaus.
