FRB 121102 is the only known repeating fast radio burst source. Here we analyze a wide-frequency-range
(1-8 GHz) sample of high-signal-to-noise, coherently dedispersed bursts detected using the Arecibo
and Green Bank telescopes. These bursts reveal complex time-frequency structures that include
sub-bursts with finite bandwidths. The frequency-dependent burst structure complicates the
determination of a dispersion measure (DM); we argue that it is appropriate to use a DM metric that
maximizes frequency-averaged pulse structure, as opposed to peak signal-to-noise, and find DM
= 560.57 +/- 0.07 pc/cc at MJD 57644. After correcting for dispersive delay, we find that the sub-bursts
have characteristic frequencies that typically drift lower at later times in the total burst envelope.
In the 1.1-1.7 GHz band, the ~ 0.5-1-ms sub-bursts have typical bandwidths ranging from 100-400
MHz, and a characteristic drift rate of ~ 200 MHz/ms towards lower frequencies. At higher radio frequencies,
the sub-burst bandwidths and drift rate are larger, on average. While these features could be intrinsic
to the burst emission mechanism, they could also be imparted by propagation effects in the medium
local to the source. Comparison of the burst DMs with previous values in the literature suggests
an increase of Delta(DM) ~ 1-3 pc/cc in 4 years, though this could be a stochastic variation as opposed
to a secular trend. This implies changes in the local medium or an additional source of frequency-dependent
delay. Overall, the results are consistent with previously proposed scenarios in which FRB 121102
is embedded in a dense nebula.
