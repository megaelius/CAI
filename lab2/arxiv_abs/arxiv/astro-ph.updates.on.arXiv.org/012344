The first image of the black hole (BH) M87* obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has the shape
of a crescent extending from the E to SWW position angles, while the observed direction of the large-scale
jet is NWW. Images based on numerical simulations of BH accretion flows suggest that on average the
projected BH spin axis would be oriented SSW. We explore highly simplified toy models for geometric
distribution and kinematics of emitting regions in the Kerr metric, perform ray tracing to calculate
the corresponding images, and simulate their observation by the EHT to calculate the corresponding
visibilities and closure phases. We strictly assume that (1) the BH spin vector is fixed to the jet
axis, (2) the emitting regions are stationary and symmetric with respect to the BH spin, (3) the emissivities
are isotropic in the local rest frames. Emission from the crescent sector SSE - SWW can be readily
explained in terms of an equatorial ring with either circular or plunging geodesic flows, regardless
of the value of BH spin. In the case of plane-symmetric polar caps with plunging geodesic flows, the
dominant image of the cap located behind the BH is sensitive to the angular momentum of the emitter.
Within the constraints of our model, we have not found a viable explanation for the observed brightness
of the SEE sector. Most likely, the SEE 'hotspot' has been produced by a non-stationary localised
perturbation in the inner accretion flow. Alternatively, it could result from locally anisotropic
synchrotron emissivities. Multi-epoch and polarimetric results from the EHT will be essential
to verify the theoretically expected alignment of the BH spin with the large-scale jet.
