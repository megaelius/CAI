Symplectic methods, in particular the Wisdom-Holman map, have revolutionized our ability to model
the long-term, conservative dynamics of planetary systems. However, many astrophysically important
effects are dissipative. The consequences of incorporating such forces into otherwise symplectic
schemes is not always clear. We show that moving to a general framework of non-commutative operators
(dissipative or not) clarifies many of these questions, and that several important properties
of symplectic schemes carry over to the general case. In particular, we show that explicit splitting
schemes generically exploit symmetries in the applied external forces which often strongly suppress
integration errors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that so-called `symplectic correctors' (which
reduce energy errors by orders of magnitude at fixed computational cost) apply equally well to weakly
dissipative systems and can thus be more generally thought of as `weak splitting correctors.' Finally,
we show that previously advocated approaches of incorporating additional forces into symplectic
methods work well for dissipative forces, but give qualitatively wrong answers for conservative
but velocity-dependent forces like post-Newtonian corrections. We release \rebx, an open-source
\clang library for incorporating additional effects into \reb N-body integrations, together
with a convenient \python wrapper. All effects are machine-independent and we provide a binary
format that interfaces with the {\tt SimulationArchive} class in \reb to enable the sharing and
reproducibility of results. Users can add effects from a list of pre-implemented astrophysical
forces, or contribute new ones.
