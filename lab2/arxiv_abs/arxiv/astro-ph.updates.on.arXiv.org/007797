Double-double radio galaxies (DDRGs) represent a short but unique phase in the life-cycle of some
of the most powerful radio-loud active galactic nuclei (RLAGN). These galaxies display large-scale
remnant radio plasma in the intergalactic medium left behind by a past episode of active galactic
nuclei (AGN) activity, and meanwhile, the radio jets have restarted in a new episode. The knowledge
of what causes the jets to switch off and restart is crucial to our understanding of galaxy evolution,
while it is important to know if DDRGs form a host galaxy dichotomy relative to RLAGN. We utilised
the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey DR1, using a visual identification method to compile a sample of morphologically
selected candidate DDRGs, showing two pairs of radio lobes. To confirm the restarted nature in each
of the candidate sources, we obtained follow-up observations with the VLA at higher resolution
to observe the inner lobes or restarted jets, the confirmation of which created a robust sample of
33 DDRGs. We created a comparison sample of 777 RLAGN from the DR1 catalogue, and compared the optical
and infrared magnitudes and colours of their host galaxies. We find that there is no statistically
significant difference in the brightness of the host galaxies between double-doubles and single-cycle
RLAGN. The DDRG and RLAGN samples also have similar distributions in WISE mid-infrared colours,
indicating similar ages of stellar populations and dust levels in the hosts of DDRGs. We conclude
that DDRGs and 'normal' RLAGN are hosted by galaxies of the same type, and that DDRG activity is simply
a normal part of the life cycle of RLAGN. Restarted jets, particularly for the class of low-excitation
radio galaxies, rather than being a product of a particular event in the life of a host galaxy, must
instead be caused by smaller scale changes, such as in the accretion system surrounding the black
hole.
