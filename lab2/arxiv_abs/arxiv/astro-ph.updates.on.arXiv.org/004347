We aim to investigate the presence of signatures of magnetic cycles and rotation on a sample of 71
early M-dwarfs from the HADES RV programme using high-resolution time-series spectroscopy of
the Ca II H & K and Halpha chromospheric activity indicators, the radial velocity series, the parameters
of the cross correlation function and the V-band photometry. We used mainly HARPS-N spectra, acquired
over four years, and add HARPS spectra from the public ESO database and ASAS photometry light-curves
as support data, extending the baseline of the observations of some stars up to 12 years. We provide
log(R'hk) measurements for all the stars in the sample, cycle length measurements for 13 stars,
rotation periods for 33 stars and we are able to measure the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity
signal induced by rotation in 16 stars. We complement our work with previous results and confirm
and refine the previously reported relationships between the mean level of chromospheric emission,
measured by the log(R'hk), with the rotation period, and with the measured semi-amplitude of the
activity induced radial velocity signal for early M-dwarfs. We searched for a possible relation
between the measured rotation periods and the lengths of the magnetic cycle, finding a weak correlation
between both quantities. Using previous v sin i measurements we estimated the inclinations of the
star's poles to the line of sight for all the stars in the sample, and estimate the range of masses of
the planets GJ 3998 b and c (2.5 - 4.9 Mearth and 6.3 - 12.5 Mearth), GJ 625 b (2.82 Mearth), GJ 3942 b (7.1
- 10.0 Mearth) and GJ 15A b (3.1 - 3.3 Mearth), assuming their orbits are coplanar with the stellar
rotation.
