Observations of evolution in the dust-to-metal ratio allow us to constrain the dominant dust processing
mechanisms. In this work, we present a study of the dust-to-metal and dust-to-gas ratios in a sub-sample
of ~500 DustPedia galaxies. Using literature and MUSE emission line fluxes, we derived gas-phase
metallicities (oxygen abundances) for over 10000 individual regions and determine characteristic
metallicities for each galaxy. We study how the relative dust, gas, and metal contents of galaxies
evolve by using metallicity and gas fraction as proxies for evolutionary state. The global oxygen
abundance and nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio are found to increase monotonically as galaxies evolve.
Additionally, unevolved galaxies (gas fraction > 60%, metallicity 12 + log(O/H) < 8.2) have dust-to-metal
ratios that are about a factor of 2.1 lower (a factor of six lower for galaxies with gas fraction > 80%)
than the typical dust-to-metal ratio (Md/MZ ~ 0.214) for more evolved sources. However, for high
gas fractions, the scatter is larger due to larger observational uncertainties as well as a potential
dependence of the dust grain growth timescale and supernova dust yield on local conditions and star
formation histories. We find chemical evolution models with a strong contribution from dust grain
growth describe these observations reasonably well. The dust-to-metal ratio is also found to be
lower for low stellar masses and high specific star formation rates (with the exception of some sources
undergoing a starburst). Finally, the metallicity gradient correlates weakly with the HI-to-stellar
mass ratio, the effective radius and the dust-to-stellar mass ratio, but not with stellar mass.
