Chromospheric observations of sunspot umbrae offer an exceptional view of magneto-acoustic shock
phenomena and the impact they have on the surrounding magnetically-dominated plasma. We employ
simultaneous slit-based spectro-polarimetry and spectral imaging observations of the chromospheric
He I 10830{\AA} and Ca II 8542{\AA} lines to examine fluctuations in the umbral magnetic field caused
by the steepening of magneto-acoustic waves into umbral flashes. Following the application of
modern inversion routines, we find evidence to support the scenario that umbral shock events cause
expansion of the embedded magnetic field lines due to the increased adiabatic pressure. The large
number statistics employed allow us to calculate the adiabatic index, gamma = 1.12 +/- 0.01, for
chromospheric umbral locations. Examination of the vector magnetic field fluctuations perpendicular
to the solar normal revealed changes up to ~200 G at the locations of umbral flashes. Such transversal
magnetic field fluctuations have not been described before. Through comparisons with non-linear
force-free field extrapolations, we find that the perturbations of the transverse field components
are orientated in the same direction as the quiescent field geometries. This implies that magnetic
field enhancements produced by umbral flashes are directed along the motion path of the developing
shock, hence producing relatively small changes, up to a maximum of ~8 degrees, in the inclination
and/or azimuthal directions of the magnetic field. Importantly, this work highlights that umbral
flashes are able to modify the full vector magnetic field, with the detection of the weaker transverse
magnetic field components made possible by high-resolution data combined with modern inversion
routines.
