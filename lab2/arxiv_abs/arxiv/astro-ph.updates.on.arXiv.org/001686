Light is affected by local inhomogeneities in its propagation, which may alter distances and so
cosmological parameter estimation. In the era of precision cosmology, the presence of inhomogeneities
may induce systematic errors if not properly accounted. In this vein, a new interpretation of the
conventional Dyer-Roeder (DR) approach by allowing light received from distant sources to travel
in regions denser than average is proposed. It is argued that the existence of a distribution of small
and moderate cosmic voids (or "black regions") implies that its matter content was redistributed
to the homogeneous and clustered matter components with the former becoming denser than the cosmic
average in the absence of voids. Phenomenologically, this means that the DR smoothness parameter
(denoted here by $\alpha_E$) can be greater than unity, and, therefore, all previous analyses constraining
it should be rediscussed with a free upper limit. Accordingly, by performing a statistical analysis
involving 557 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from Union2 compilation data in a flat $\Lambda$CDM model
we obtain for the extended parameter, $\alpha_E=1.26^{+0.68}_{-0.54}$ ($1\sigma$). The effects
of $\alpha_E$ are also analyzed for generic $\Lambda$CDM models and flat XCDM cosmologies. For
both models, we find that a value of $\alpha_E$ greater than unity is able to harmonize SNe Ia and cosmic
microwave background observations thereby alleviating the well-known tension between low and
high redshift data. Finally, a simple toy model based on the existence of cosmic voids is proposed
in order to justify why $\alpha_E$ can be greater than unity as required by supernovae data.
