We present multiline CO observations of the complex submillimeter galaxy SMM J00266+1708. Using
the Zpectrometer on the Green Bank Telescope, we provide the first precise spectroscopic measurement
of its redshift (z=2.742). Based on followup CO(1-0), CO(3-2), and CO(5-4) mapping, SMM J00266+1708
appears to have two distinct components separated by ~500 km/s that are nearly coincident along
our line of sight. The two components show hints of different kinematics, with the blue-shifted
component dispersion-dominated and the red-shifted component showing a clear velocity gradient.
CO line ratios differ slightly between the two components, indicating that the physical conditions
in their molecular gas may not be alike. We tentatively infer that SMM J00266+1708 is an ongoing merger
with a mass ratio of (7.8+/-4.0)/sin^2(i), with its overall size and surface brightness closely
resembling that of other merging systems. We perform large velocity gradient modeling of the CO
emission from both components and find that each component's properties are consistent with a single
phase of molecular gas (i.e., a single temperatures and density); additional multi-phase modeling
of the red-shifted component, although motivated by a CO(1-0) size larger than the CO(3-2) size,
is inconclusive. SMM J00266+1708 provides evidence of early stage mergers within the submillimeter
galaxy population. Continuum observations of J00266 at the ~1" resolution of our observations
could not have distinguished between the two components due to their separation (0.73" +/- 0.06"),
illustrating that the additional velocity information provided by spectral line studies is important
for addressing the prevalence of unresolved galaxy pairs in low-resolution submillimeter surveys.
