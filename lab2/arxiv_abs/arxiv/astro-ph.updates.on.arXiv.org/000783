Samples of pristine Solar System material found in meteorites and interplanetary dust particles
are highly enriched in (15)N. Conspicuous nitrogen isotopic anomalies have also been measured
in comets, and the (14)N/(15)N abundance ratio of the Earth is itself larger than the recognised
pre-solar value by almost a factor of two. Ion--molecules, low-temperature chemical reactions
in the proto-solar nebula have been repeatedly indicated as responsible for these (15)N-enhancements.
We have searched for (15)N variants of the N2H+ ion in L1544, a prototypical starless cloud core which
is one of the best candidate sources for detection owing to its low central core temperature and high
CO depletion. The goal is the evaluation of accurate and reliable (14)N/(15)N ratio values for this
species in the interstellar gas. A deep integration of the (15)NNH+ (1-0) line at 90.4 GHz has been
obtained with the IRAM 30 m telescope. Non-LTE radiative transfer modelling has been performed
on the J=1-0 emissions of the parent and (15)N-containing dyazenilium ions, using a Bonnor--Ebert
sphere as a model for the source. A high-quality fit of the N2H+ (1--0) hyperfine spectrum has allowed
us to derive a revised value of the N2H+ column density in L1544. Analysis of the observed N(15)NH+
and (15)NNH+ spectra yielded an abundance ratio N[N(15)NH+]/N[(15)NNH+] = 1.1 +/- 0.3. The obtained
(14)N/(15)N ratio is ~ 1000 +/- 200, suggestive of a sizeable (15)N depletion in this molecular ion.
Such a result is not consistent with the prediction of present nitrogen chemical models. As chemical
models predict large (15)N fractionation of N2H+, we suggest that (15)N(14)N, or (15)N in some other
molecular form, is preferentially depleted onto dust grains.
