We present morphological properties of dusty star-forming galaxies at z=1-3 determined with high-resolution
(FWHM~0"19) Atacama Large Milllimeter/submilimeter Array (ALMA) 1-mm band maps of our ASAGAO
survey covering a 26-arcmin^2 area in GOODS-S. In conjunction with the ALMA archival data, the present
sample consists of 42 ALMA sources with a wide rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) luminosity L_FIR range
of ~10^11-10^13 Lo. To obtain an average rest-frame FIR profile, we perform individual measurements
and careful stacking of the ALMA sources using the uv-visibility method that includes positional-uncertainty
and smoothing-effect evaluations through Monte-Carlo simulations. We find that the dusty star-forming
galaxies have the average FIR-wavelength Sersic index and effective radius of n_FIR=1.2+/-0.2
and R_e,FIR=1.0-1.3 kpc, respectively, additionally with a point source at the center, indicative
of the existence of AGN. The average FIR profile agrees with a morphology of an exponential-disk
clearly distinguished from a spheroidal profile (Sersic index of 4). We also examine the rest-frame
optical Sersic index n_opt and effective radius R_e,opt with the deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
images. Interestingly, we obtain n_opt=0.9+/-0.3 (~n_FIR) and R_e,opt=3.2+/-0.6 kpc (>R_e,FIR),
suggesting that the FIR-emitting disk is embedded within a larger stellar disk. The rest-frame
UV and FIR data of HST and ALMA provide us a radial surface density profile of the total star-formation
rate (SFR), where the FIR SFR dominates over the UV SFR at the center. Under the simple assumption
of a constant SFR, a compact stellar distribution found in z~1-2 compact quiescent galaxies (cQGs)
is well reproduced, while a spheroidal stellar morphology of cQGs (n_opt=4) cannot, suggestive
of other important mechanisms such as dynamical dissipation.
