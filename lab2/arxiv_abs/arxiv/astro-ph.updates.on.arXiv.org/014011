We present high resolution, deep imaging of interstellar comet 2I/Borisov taken with the Hubble
Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 (HST/WFC3) on 2019 December 8 UTC and 2020 January 27 UTC (HST
GO 16040, Bolin et al. 2019a) before and after its perihelion passage in combination with HST/WFC3
images taken on 2019 October 12 UTC and 2019 November 16 UTC (HST GO/DD 16009, Jewitt et al. 2019b)
before its outburst and fragmentation of March 2020, thus observing the comet in a relatively undisrupted
state. We locate 1-2"~long (2,000 - 3,000 km projected length) jet-like structures near the optocenter
of 2I that appear to change position angles from epoch to epoch, though they remain stationary in
time-series imaging data spanning $\sim$70 h on 2019 December 23-25 UTC (HST GO 16043, Meech et al.
2019). With the assumption that the jet is located near the rotational pole, determine that 2I's
pole points near $\alpha$ = 322$\pm$10$^\circ$, $\delta$ = 37$\pm$10$^\circ$. We find evidence
for periodicity in the time-series lightcurve explained by a nucleus rotation period of $\sim$10.6
h and amplitude of $\sim$0.05 (though we caution that with such a small amplitude the observed lightcurve
variations might be caused by other effects, e.g., variability in short-term activity, Lin et al.
2017). Combining our estimated rotational pole position and lightcurve amplitude implies a $b/a$
axial ratio of $\sim$1.5 typical for Solar System comets, very unlike the $b/a$ of 4 to 10 found for
1I/`Oumuamua (Bolin et al. 2018). Unless 2I's nucleus was $\lesssim$200 m in size and was spun up
rapidly by a pronounced jet after our observations, the March 2020 outburst (Drahus et al. 2020)
and fragmentation (Bolin et al 2020) was most likely due to a calving event driven by thermal wave
penetration, e.g., as for comets 17 P/Holmes and 73P/Schwassmann$-$Wachmann (Stevenson et al.
2010, Graykowski $\&$ Jewitt 2019).
