Magnetic reconnection is the most likely mechanism responsible for the high temperature events
that are observed in strongly magnetized locations around the temperature minimum in the low solar
chromosphere. This work improves upon our previous work ["Magnetic Reconnection in Strongly Magnetized
Regions of the Low Solar Chromosphere", The Astrophysical Journal 852, 95 (2018) ] by using a more
realistic radiative cooling model computed from the OPACITY project and the CHIANTI database.
We find that the rate of ionization of the neutral component of the plasma is still faster than recombination
within the current sheet region. For low $\beta$ plasmas, the ionized and neutral fluid flows are
well-coupled throughout the reconnection region resembling the single-fluid Sweet-Parker model
dynamics. Decoupling of the ion and neutral inflows appears in the higher $\beta$ case with $\beta_0=1.46$,
which leads to a reconnection rate about three times faster than the rate predicted by the Sweet-Parker
model. In all cases, the plasma temperature increases with time inside the current sheet, and the
maximum value is above $2\times10^4$~K when the reconnection magnetic field strength is greater
than $500$~G. While the more realistic radiative cooling model does not result in qualitative changes
of the characteristics of magnetic reconnection, it is necessary for studying the variations of
the plasma temperature and ionization fraction inside current sheets in strongly magnetized regions
of the low solar atmosphere. It is also important for studying energy conversion during the magnetic
reconnection process when the hydrogen-dominated plasma approaches full ionization.
