The formation of the most massive O-type stars is poorly understood. We present a case study of a young
massive clump from the ATLASGAL survey, G328.2551-0.5321. It exhibits a bolometric luminosity
of 1.3$\times$10$^4$ L$_{\odot}$ corresponding to a current protostellar mass of $\sim$11 and
16 M$_{\odot}$. We analyze high angular-resolution observations with ALMA at $\sim$0.17" corresponding
a physical scale of $\sim$400 au in dust continuum and molecular lines. The dust continuum emission
reveals a single high-mass protostellar envelope and shows evidence for a marginally resolved
continuum source. We detect a rotational line of CH$_3$OH within its $v_{\rm t}$=1 torsionally
excited state revealing two bright peaks of emission spatially offset from the dust continuum peak,
and exhibiting a distinct velocity component $\pm$4.5 km s$^{-1}$ offset compared to the source
$v_{\rm lsr}$. Local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis suggests N(CH$_3$OH)=1.2$-$2$\times$10$^{19}$
cm$^{-2}$, and kinetic temperatures of 160$-$200 K at the position of these peaks. Their velocity
shifts correspond well to the expected Keplerian velocity around a central object with 15M$_{\odot}$
consistent with the mass estimate based on the source's bolometric luminosity. We propose a picture
where the CH$_3$OH emission peaks trace the accretion shocks around the centrifugal barrier, pinpointing
the interaction region between the collapsing envelope and an accretion disk. Because the HC$_3$N
$v_{\rm 7}$=1e ($J$=38-37) line shows compact emission, and a velocity pattern consistent with
models of Keplerian rotation, we suggest that this could be a new tracer for compact accretion disks
around high-mass protostars. The estimated physical properties of the accretion disk suggest
a specific angular momentum several times larger than typically observed towards low-mass protostars.
