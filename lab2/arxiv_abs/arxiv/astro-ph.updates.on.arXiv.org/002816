We present the first amplitude analysis of the CERN data on pi(-)p->pi(-)pi(+)n on polarized
target at 17.2 GeV/c for dipion masses 580-1080 MeV at low momentum transfer using spin mixing mechanism.
The analysis of the S- and P-wave subsystem determines a unique solution for the spin mixing transversity
amplitudes S_tau, L_tau, the corresponding S-matrix amplitudes S^0_tau, L^0_tau and the rho^0(770)-f_0(980)
spin mixing parameters. The spin mixing mechanism allows to extract D-wave observables from the
CERN data. Analysis of the full D-wave subsystem for transversity tau=u reveals rho^0(770) mixing
in the amplitudes |D^U_u|^2 and |D^N_u|^2 and a violation of a cosine condition by the amplitudes
D^2U_u and D^2N_u. We determine spin mixing and S-matrix helicity amplitudes from which we calculate
pipi phase-shifts delta^0_S and delta_P below KKbar threshold. The spin mixing and the violation
of the cosine condition arise from a non-standard pure dephasing interaction of the produced final
S-matrix state rho_f(S) with a quantum state rho(E) of a quantum environment to produce the observed
state rho_f(O). Our analysis determines that the number of interacting degrees of freedom of the
environment is M=4. We identify the four eigenstates |e_k> that define the density matrix rho(E)
with the four neutrino mass eigenstates |m_k> with m_4 due to light sterile neutrino. We call
the quantum states rho(E) dark neutrinos and propose to identify them with the particles of a distinct
component of dark matter. Dephasing interactions are not rare events but they require high statistics
experiments with polarized targets for their detection. Our amplitude analysis illustrates this
new kind of search for dark matter.
