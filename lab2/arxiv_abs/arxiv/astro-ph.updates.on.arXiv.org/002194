Mid-infrared spectral observations Uranus acquired with the Infrared Spectrometer (IRS) on the
Spitzer Space Telescope are used to determine the abundances of C2H2, C2H6, CH3C2H, C4H2, CO2, and
tentatively CH3 on Uranus at the time of the 2007 equinox. For vertically uniform eddy diffusion
coefficients in the range 2200-2600 cm2 s-1, photochemical models that reproduce the observed
methane emission also predict C2H6 profiles that compare well with emission in the 11.6-12.5 micron
wavelength region, where the nu9 band of C2H6 is prominent. Our nominal model with a uniform eddy
diffusion coefficient Kzz = 2430 cm2 sec-1 and a CH4 tropopause mole fraction of 1.6x10-5 provides
a good fit to other hydrocarbon emission features, such as those of C2H2 and C4H2, but the model profile
for CH3C2H must be scaled by a factor of 0.43, suggesting that improvements are needed in the chemical
reaction mechanism for C3Hx species. The nominal model is consistent with a CH3D/CH4 ratio of 3.0+-0.2x10-4.
From the best-fit scaling of these photochemical-model profiles, we derive column abundances
above the 10-mbar level of 4.5+01.1/-0.8 x 10+19 molecule-cm-2 for CH4, 6.2 +- 1.0 x 10+16 molecule-cm-2
for C2H2 (with a value 24% higher from a different longitudinal sampling), 3.1 +- 0.3 x 10+16 molecule-cm-2
for C2H6, 8.6 +- 2.6 x 10+13 molecule-cm-2 for CH3C2H, 1.8 +- 0.3 x 10+13 molecule-cm-2 for C4H2, and
1.7 +- 0.4 x 10+13 molecule-cm-2 for CO2 on Uranus. Our results have implications with respect to
the influx rate of exogenic oxygen species and the production rate of stratospheric hazes on Uranus,
as well as the C4H2 vapor pressure over C4H2 ice at low temperatures.
