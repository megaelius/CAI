Absorption spectra toward Herschel 36 for the A^1Pi <-- X^1Sigma transitions of CH+ in the J=1
excited rotational level and the A^2Delta <-- X^2Pi transition of CH in the J=3/2 excited fine
structure level have been analyzed. These excited levels are above their ground levels by 40.1 K
and ~25.7 K and indicate high radiative temperatures of the environment, 14.6 K and 6.7 K, respectively.
The effect of the high radiative temperature is more spectacular in some diffuse interstellar bands
(DIBs) observed toward Her 36; remarkable extended tails toward red (ETR) were observed. We interpret
these ETRs as due to a small decrease of rotational constants upon excitation of excited electronic
states. This, together with radiative pumping of high J rotational levels cause the ETRs. In order
to study this effect quantitatively, we have developed a model calculation in which the effects
of collision and radiation are treated simultaneously. The simplest case of linear molecules is
considered. It has been found that the ETR is reproduced if the fraction of the variation of the rotational
constant, beta = (B'-B)/B, is sufficiently high (3-5%) and the radiative temperature is high (T_r
> 50 K). Although modeling for general molecules is beyond the scope of this paper, the results
indicate that the prototypical DIBs at 5780.5, 5797.1, and 6613.6 A which show the pronounced ETRs
are due to polar molecules sensitive to the radiative excitation. The requirement of high beta favors
relatively small molecules with 3-6 heavy atoms. DIBs at 5849.8, 6196.0, and 6379.3 A which do not
show the pronounced ETRs are likely due to non-polar molecules or large polar molecules with small
beta.
