The Southern hemisphere of the 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko comet has become visible from Rosetta
only since March 2015. It was illuminated during the perihelion passage and therefore it contains
the regions that experienced the strongest heating and erosion rate, thus exposing the subsurface
most pristine material. In this work we investigate, thanks to the OSIRIS images, the geomorphology,
the spectrophotometry and some transient events of two Southern hemisphere regions: Anhur and
part of Bes. Bes is dominated by outcropping consolidated terrain covered with fine particle deposits,
while Anhur appears strongly eroded with elongated canyon-like structures, scarp retreats, different
kinds of deposits, and degraded sequences of strata indicating a pervasive layering. We discovered
a new 140 m long and 10 m high scarp formed in the Anhur/Bes boundary during/after the perihelion passage,
close to the area where exposed CO$_2$ and H$_2$O ices were previously detected. Several jets have
been observed originating from these regions, including the strong perihelion outburst, an active
pit, and a faint optically thick dust plume. We identify several areas with a relatively bluer slope
(i.e. a lower spectral slope value) than their surroundings, indicating a surface composition
enriched with some water ice. These spectrally bluer areas are observed especially in talus and
gravitational accumulation deposits where freshly exposed material had fallen from nearby scarps
and cliffs. The investigated regions become spectrally redder beyond 2 au outbound when the dust
mantle became thicker, masking the underlying ice-rich layers.
