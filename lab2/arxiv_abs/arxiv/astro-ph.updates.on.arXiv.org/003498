While feedback from massive stars exploding as supernovae (SNe) is thought to be one of the key ingredients
regulating galaxy formation, theoretically it is still unclear how the available energy couples
to the interstellar medium and how galactic scale outflows are launched. We present a novel implementation
of six sub-grid SN feedback schemes in the moving-mesh code Arepo, including injections of thermal
and/or kinetic energy, two parametrizations of delayed cooling feedback and a `mechanical' feedback
scheme that injects the correct amount of momentum depending on the relevant scale of the SN remnant
resolved. All schemes make use of individually time-resolved SN events. Adopting isolated disk
galaxy setups at different resolutions, with the highest resolution runs reasonably resolving
the Sedov-Taylor phase of the SN, we aim to find a physically motivated scheme with as few tunable
parameters as possible. As expected, simple injections of energy overcool at all but the highest
resolution. Our delayed cooling schemes result in overstrong feedback, destroying the disk. The
mechanical feedback scheme is efficient at suppressing star formation, agrees well with the Kennicutt-Schmidt
relation and leads to converged star formation rates and galaxy morphologies with increasing resolution
without fine tuning any parameters. However, we find it difficult to produce outflows with high
enough mass loading factors at all but the highest resolution, indicating either that we have oversimplified
the evolution of unresolved SN remnants, require other stellar feedback processes to be included,
require a better star formation prescription or most likely some combination of these issues.
