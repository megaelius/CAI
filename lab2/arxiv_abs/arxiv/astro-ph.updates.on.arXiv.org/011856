In this paper we present a detailed analysis of the Faraday depth (FD) spectrum and its clean components
obtained through the application of the commonly used technique of Faraday rotation measure synthesis
to analyze spectro-polarimetric data. In order to directly compare the Faraday depth spectrum
with physical properties of a magneto-ionic medium, we generated synthetic broad-bandwidth spectro-polarimetric
observations from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a transonic, isothermal, compressible
turbulent medium. We find that correlated magnetic field structures give rise to a combination
of spiky, localized peaks at certain FD values, and broad structures in the FD spectrum. Although
the majority of these spiky FD structures appear narrow, giving an impression of a Faraday thin medium,
we show that they arise from strong synchrotron emissivity at that FD. Strong emissivity at a FD can
arise because of both strong spatially-local polarized synchrotron emissivity at a FD or accumulation
of weaker emissions along the distance through a medium that have Faraday depths within half the
width of the rotation measure spread function. Such a complex Faraday depth spectrum is a natural
consequence of MHD turbulence when the lines of sight pass through a few turbulent cells. This therefore
complicates the convention of attributing narrow FD peaks to presence of a Faraday rotating medium
along the line of sight. Our work shows that it is difficult to extract the FD along a line of sight from
the Faraday depth spectrum using standard methods for a turbulent medium in which synchrotron emission
and Faraday rotation occur simultaneously.
