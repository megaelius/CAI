HI Intensity Mapping (IM) will be used to do precision cosmology using many existing and upcoming
radio observatories. The signal will be contaminated due to absorption, the largest component
of which will be the flux absorbed by the HI emitting sources themselves from the flux incident on
them from background radio continuum sources. We, for the first time, provide a quantitative estimate
of the magnitude of the absorbed flux compared to the emitted HI flux for various voxels placed at
redshifts between 0.1 and 2.5. We use a cosmological sky simulation of the atomic HI emission line,
and sum over the emitted and absorbed fluxes for all sources within voxels at different redshifts.
For estimating the absorbed flux we use various relations based on existing observations as well
as simulations. We find that for the same co-moving volume of sky, the HI emission falls off quickly
with increasing redshift, while the absorption varies much less with redshift and follows the redshift
distribution of faint sources that dominate the number counts of radio continuum sources. This
results in the fraction of absorption compared to emission to be negligible in the nearby Universe
(up to a redshift of ~0.5), increases to about 10% at a redshift of 1, and continues to increase to about
30% up to a redshift of 2.5. These numbers can vary significantly due to the uncertainties on the exact
forms of the various relations used, the largest variation being driven by the uncertainty on the
number counts of radio continuum sources at sub-mJy flux densities. Absorption of flux incident
from background radio continuum sources might become an important contaminant to HI IM signals
beyond redshifts of 0.5, and needs to be quantified more accurately using inputs from upcoming deep
high resolution surveys of radio continuum sources, HI absorption, and HI emission with the SKA
and its precursors.
