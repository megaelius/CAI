Detailed knowledge of the variability of classical Cepheids, in particular their modulations
and mode composition, provides crucial insight into stellar structure and pulsation. However,
tiny modulations of the dominant radial-mode pulsation were recently found to be very frequent,
possibly ubiquitous in Cepheids, which makes secondary modes difficult to detect and analyse,
since these modulations can easily mask the potentially weak secondary modes. The aim of this study
is to re-investigate the secondary mode content in the sample of OGLE-III and -IV single-mode classical
Cepheids using kernel regression with adaptive kernel width for pre-whitening, instead of using
a constant-parameter model. This leads to a more precise removal of the modulated dominant pulsation,
and enables a more complete survey of secondary modes with frequencies outside a narrow range around
the primary. Our analysis reveals that significant secondary modes occur more frequently among
first overtone Cepheids than previously thought. The mode composition appears significantly
different in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, suggesting a possible dependence on chemical
composition. In addition to the formerly identified non-radial mode at $P_2 \approx 0.6\ldots
0.65 P_1$ (0.62-mode), and a cluster of modes with near-primary frequency, we find two more candidate
non-radial modes. One is a numerous group of secondary modes with $P_2 \approx 1.25 P_1$, which may
represent the fundamental of the 0.62-mode, supposed to be the first harmonic of an $l \in \{7,8,
9\}$ non-radial mode. The other new mode is at $P_2 \approx 1.46 P_1$, possibly analogous to a similar,
rare mode recently discovered among first overtone RR Lyrae stars.
