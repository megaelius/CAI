The Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) galaxies possess rotating planes of satellites. Their formation
has not been explained satisfactorily yet. It was suggested that the MW and M31 satellites are ancient
tidal dwarf galaxies, which could explain their configuration. This suggestion gained support
by an analytic backward calculation of the relative MW-M31 orbit in the MOND modified dynamics paradigm
by Zhao et al. (2013) implying their close flyby 7-11 Gyr ago. Here we explore the Local Group history
in MOND in more detail using a simplified first-ever self-consistent simulation. We note the features
induced by the encounter in the simulation and identify their possible real counterparts. The simulation
was set to approximately reproduce the observed MW and M31 masses, effective radii, separation,
relative velocity and disk inclinations. We used the publicly available adaptive-mesh-refinement
code Phantom of RAMSES. In the simulation, matter was transferred from the MW to M31 along a tidal
tail. The encounter induced formation of several structures resembling the peculiarities of the
Local Group. Most notably: 1) A rotating planar structure formed around M31 from the transferred
material. It had a size similar to the observed satellite plane and was oriented edge-on to the simulated
MW, just as the real one. 2) The same structure also resembled the tidal features observed around
M31 by its size and morphology. 3) A warp in the MW developed with an amplitude and orientation similar
to that observed. Moreover, a cloud of particles formed around the simulated MW, with the extent
of the actual MW satellite system. The encounter did not end by merging in a Hubble time. The simulation
thus demonstrated that MOND can possibly explain many peculiarities of the Local Group. Future
more elaborate simulations should verify and expand our conclusions. (abridged)
