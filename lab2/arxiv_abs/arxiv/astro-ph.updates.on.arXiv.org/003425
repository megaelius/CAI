We present a high-resolution smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation of the Antennae galaxies
(NGC 4038/4039) and follow the evolution $3$ Gyrs beyond the final coalescence. The simulation
includes metallicity dependent cooling, star formation, and both stellar feedback and chemical
enrichment. The simulated best-match Antennae reproduces well both the observed morphology and
the off-nuclear starburst. We also produce for the first time a simulated two-dimensional metallicity
map of the Antennae and find good agreement with the observed metallicity of off-nuclear stellar
clusters, however the nuclear metallicities are overproduced by $\sim 0.5$ dex. Using the radiative
transfer code SKIRT we produce multi-wavelength observations of both the Antennae and the merger
remnant. The $1$ Gyr old remnant is well fitted with a S\'ersic profile of $n=4.05$, and with an $r$-band
effective radius of $r_{\mathrm{e}}= 1.8$ kpc and velocity dispersion of $\sigma_{\mathrm{e}}=180$
km$/$s the remnant is located on the fundamental plane of early-type galaxies (ETGs). The initially
blue Antennae remnant evolves onto the red sequence after $\sim 2.5$ Gyr of secular evolution. The
remnant would be classified as a fast rotator, as the specific angular momentum evolves from $\lambda_R\approx0.11$
to $\lambda_R\approx0.14$ during its evolution. The remnant shows ordered rotation and a double
peaked maximum in the mean 2D line-of-sight velocity. These kinematical features are relatively
common among local ETGs and we specifically identify three local ETGs (NGC 3226, NGC 3379 and NGC
4494) in the ATLAS$^\mathrm{3D}$ sample, whose photometric and kinematic properties most resemble
the Antennae remnant.
