We present $\kappa$ Andromeda b's photometry and astrometry taken with Subaru/SCExAO+HiCIAO
and Keck/NIRC2, combined with recently published SCExAO/CHARIS low-resolution spectroscopy
and published thermal infrared photometry to further constrain the companion's atmospheric properties
and orbit. $\kappa$ And b's Y/Y-K colors are redder than field dwarfs, consistent with its youth
and lower gravity. Empirical comparisons of its Y-band photometry and CHARIS spectrum to a large
spectral library of isolated field dwarfs reaffirm the conclusion from Currie et al. (2018) that
it likely has a low gravity but admit a wider range of most plausible spectral types (L0-L2). Our gravitational
classification also suggests that the best-fit objects for $\kappa$ And b may have lower gravity
than those previously reported. Atmospheric models lacking dust/clouds fail to reproduce its
entire 1--4.7 $\mu m$ spectral energy distribution, cloudy atmosphere models with temperatures
of $\sim$ 1700--2000 $K$ better match $\kappa$ And b data. Most well-fitting model comparisons
favor 1700--1900 $K$, a surface gravity of log(g) $\sim$ 4--4.5, and a radius of 1.3--1.6\,$R_{\rm
Jup}$; the best-fit model (DRIFT-Phoenix) yields the coolest and lowest-gravity values: $T_{\rm
eff}$=1700 K and $\log g$=4.0. An update to $\kappa$ And b's orbit with ExoSOFT using new astrometry
spanning seven years reaffirms its high eccentricity ($0.77\pm0.08$). We consider a scenario
where unseen companions are responsible for scattering $\kappa$ And b to a wide separation and high
eccentricity. If three planets, including $\kappa$ And b, were born with coplanar orbits and one
of them was ejected by gravitational scattering, a potential inner companion with mass $\gtrsim10M_{\rm
Jup}$ could be located at $\lesssim$ 25 au.
