Modern extreme adaptive optics (AO) systems achieving diffraction-limited performance open
up new possibilities for instrumentation. Especially important for the fields of spectroscopy
and interferometry is that it enables the prospect to couple light into single-mode fibers (SMFs).
However, due to their small size, efficient coupling is very sensitive to the quality of the fiber
alignment, beam drifts and higher-frequency tip-tilt aberrations caused by telescope mechanics
and vibrations. These residual aberrations are not always sensed and corrected by the AO system,
leading to unacceptable losses. This is particularly severe for the Extremely Large Telescopes,
where their huge structure will mean vibrations increase and optimal AO solutions are even more
difficult to implement. We have created a focal plane sensor to correct for residual aberrations
by surrounding the SMF with six Multi-mode fibers (MMFs). On each of the MMFs sits a printed freeform
lens, making up a six-element micro-lens ring to refract the light into these surrounding MMFs and
thus minimizing light loss in the gap between the fiber cores. This means when the beam is near diffraction
limited and centered almost all light couples to the SMF. When the beam is misaligned, it couples
to the surrounding cores, which are read out by a detector and processed by the DARC software driving
a tip-tilt mirror. Currently we are aiming to detect and correct only tip-tilt aberrations. However,
choosing to surround the central fiber with six sensing locations potentially allows us to investigate
higher order correction modes. Here we present the design and performance our prototype system.
This has been designed for use with the iLocater fiber injection system at the LBT and can easily be
scaled to larger telescopes. We present test results from the KOOL laboratory and initial integration
with the iLocater instrument.
