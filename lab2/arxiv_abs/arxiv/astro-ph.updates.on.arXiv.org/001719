We present Magellan/MIKE and Keck/HIRES high-resolution spectra of six red giant stars in the dwarf
galaxy Segue 1. Including one additional Segue 1 star observed by Norris et al. (2010), high-resolution
spectra have now been obtained for every red giant in Segue 1. Remarkably, three of these seven stars
have metallicities below [Fe/H] = -3.5, suggesting that Segue 1 is the least chemically evolved
galaxy known. We confirm previous medium-resolution analyses demonstrating that Segue 1 stars
span a metallicity range of more than 2 dex, from [Fe/H] = -1.4 to [Fe/H] = -3.8. All of the Segue 1 stars
are alpha-enhanced, with [alpha/Fe] ~ 0.5. High alpha-element abundances are typical for metal-poor
stars, but in every previously studied galaxy [alpha/Fe] declines for more metal-rich stars, which
is typically interpreted as iron enrichment from supernova Ia. The absence of this signature in
Segue 1 indicates that it was enriched exclusively by massive stars. Other light element abundance
ratios in Segue 1, including carbon-enhancement in the three most metal-poor stars, closely resemble
those of metal-poor halo stars. Finally, we classify the most metal-rich star as a CH star given its
large overabundances of carbon and s-process elements. The other six stars show remarkably low
neutron-capture element abundances of [Sr/H] < -4.9 and [Ba/H] < -4.2, which are comparable
to the lowest levels ever detected in halo stars. This suggests minimal neutron-capture enrichment,
perhaps limited to a single r-process or weak s-process synthesizing event. Altogether, the chemical
abundances of Segue 1 indicate no substantial chemical evolution, supporting the idea that it may
be a surviving first galaxy that experienced only one burst of star formation.
