We report on intriguing photometric properties of Galactic stars observed in the GALEX satellite's
far-UV and near-UV bandbasses as well as from the SDSS survey and the Kepler Input Catalog. First,
the FUV-NUV color distribution of stars in the Kepler field consists of 2 distinct peaks. Second,
curiously, for stars with spectral types G or later the mean FUV-NUV color becomes much bluer, contrary
to expectation. we have found in two samples of mid-F through K type stars that ~14-18% of them exhibit
FUV-excesses relative to their NUV fluxes and spectral types. Nearly the same fractions are also
discovered among members of the Kepler Eclipsing Binary Catalog and in the published list of Kepler
Objects of Interest. These UV-excess ("UVe") colors are confirmed by the UV continuum slopes in
GALEX spectra. The SDSS spectra of some UVe stars exhibit metallic line weakening especially in
the blue. This suggests an enhanced contribution of UV flux relative to photospheric flux of a solar-type
single star. We consider the possibility that the UV excesses originate from various types of hot
stars, including binaries, and strong chromosphere stars that. Our model atmosphere-derived
simulations of colors for binaries with main sequence pairs with a hot secondary demonstrate that
the color loci conflict with the observed sequence. We are left with the active chromospheres explanation,
whether in active binaries or young stars, as a still tentative explanation for the UVe stars. We
also address the presence of an island of "UV red" stars in the NUV-g, g-i color diagram. The subpopulation
comprising this island are mainly horizontal branch stars. These objects do not exhibit UV excesses
and therefore have UV colors typical for their spectral types. This subpopulation appears "red"
in the UV because their colors are not pulled to the blue by the UVe stars.
