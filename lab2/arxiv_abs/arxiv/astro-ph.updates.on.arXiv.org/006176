The use of machine learning is becoming ubiquitous in astronomy, but remains rare in the study of
the atmospheres of exoplanets. Given the spectrum of an exoplanetary atmosphere, a multi-parameter
space is swept through in real time to find the best-fit model. Known as atmospheric retrieval, it
is a technique that originates from the Earth and planetary sciences. Such methods are very time-consuming
and by necessity there is a compromise between physical and chemical realism versus computational
feasibility. Machine learning has previously been used to determine which molecules to include
in the model, but the retrieval itself was still performed using standard methods. Here, we report
an adaptation of the random forest method of supervised machine learning, trained on a pre-computed
grid of atmospheric models, which retrieves full posterior distributions of the abundances of
molecules and the cloud opacity. The use of a pre-computed grid allows a large part of the computational
burden to be shifted offline. We demonstrate our technique on a transmission spectrum of the hot
gas-giant exoplanet WASP-12b using a five-parameter model (temperature, a constant cloud opacity
and the volume mixing ratios or relative abundance by number of water, ammonia and hydrogen cyanide).
We obtain results consistent with the standard nested-sampling retrieval method. Additionally,
we can estimate the sensitivity of the measured spectrum to constraining the model parameters and
we can quantify the information content of the spectrum. Our method can be straightforwardly applied
using more sophisticated atmospheric models and also to interpreting an ensemble of spectra without
having to retrain the random forest.
