I present a total of 98.8 ksec ($\sim$ 3$\times$30 ksec) observation of T Pyx with the ACIS-S3 detector
on-board the $Chandra$ Observatory obtained during the quiescent phase, about 2-3 months before
its outburst in April 2011. The total $Chandra$ spectrum of the source T Pyx gives a maximum temperature
kT$_{max}$$>$ 37.0 keV with (0.9-1.5)$\times 10^{-13}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ and (1.3-2.2)$\times$10$^{32}$
erg s$^{-1}$ (at 3.5 kpc) in the 0.1-50 keV range using a multi-temperature plasma emission model
(i.e., CEVMKL in XSPEC). I find a ratio of (L$_{x}$/L$_{disk}$)$\simeq$(2-7)$\times$10$^{-4}$
indicating considerable inefficiency of emission in the boundary layer. There is no blackbody
emission with 2$\sigma$ upper limits kT$_{BB}$$<$ 25 eV and L$_{soft}$$<$ 2.0$\times$10$^{33}$
erg s$^{-1}$ in the 0.1-10.0 keV band. All fits yield only interstellar N${\rm _H}$ during quiescence.
I suggest that T Pyx has an optically thin boundary layer (BL) merged with an ADAF-like flow (Advection-Dominated
Flow) and/or X-ray corona in the inner disk indicating ongoing quasi-spherical accretion at (very)
high rates during quiescent phases. Such a BL structure may be excessively heating the WD, influencing
the thermonuclear runaway leading to the recurrent nova events. The central source (i.e., the binary
system) emission and its spectrum is deconvolved with a detailed procedure at the sub-pixel level
revealing an extended emission with S/N $\sim$6-10. The derived shape looks like an elliptical
nebula with a semi-major axis $\sim$1.0 arc sec and a semi-minor axis $\sim$0.5 arc sec. The calculated
approximate count rate of the extended emission is 0.0013-0.0025 c s$^{-1}$. The luminosity of
the nebula is $\sim$(0.6-30.0)$\times$10$^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The nebulosity seems consistent
with an interaction of the outflow/ejecta from the 1966 outburst.
