(abridged) We study the young stellar system GW Ori, concentrating on its accretion/wind activity
by using our high-resolution optical spectra and $U$-band photometry. We also characterize the
disk properties of GW Ori by modeling its spectral energy distribution (SED). By comparing our data
to the synthetical spectra, we classify GW Ori as a G8 star. Based on the RVs derived from the spectra,
we confirm the previous result as a close companion in GW Ori with a period of ~242 days and an orbital
semi-major axis of ~1 AU. The RV residuals after the subtraction of the orbital solution with the
equivalent widths of accretion-related emission lines vary with periods of 5-6.7 days during short
time intervals, which are caused by the rotational modulation. The H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ line
profiles of GW Ori can be decomposed in two central-peaked emission components and one blue-shifted
absorption component. The absorption components are due to a disk wind modulated by the orbital
motion of the close companion. Therefore, the systems like GW Ori can be used to study the extent of
disk winds. We find that the accretion rates of GW Ori are rather constant but can occasionally be
enhanced by a factor of 2-3. We reproduce the SED of GW Ori by using disk models with gaps ~25-55 AU in
size. A small population of tiny dust particles within the gap produces the excess emission at near-infrared
bands and the strong and sharp silicate feature at 10 $\mu$m. The SED of GW Ori exhibits dramatic changes
on timescales of ~20 yr in the near-infrared bands, which can be explained as the change in the amount
and distribution of small dust grains in the gap. We collect a sample of binary/multiple systems
with disks in the literature and find a strong positive correlation between their gap sizes and separations
from the primaries to companions, which is generally consistent with the prediction from the theory.
