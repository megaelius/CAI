Although highly successful on cosmological scales, Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models predict unobserved
over-dense \squote{cusps} in dwarf galaxies and overestimate their formation rate. We consider
an ultra-light axion-like scalar boson which promises to reduce these observational discrepancies
at galactic scales. The model, known as Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM), avoids cusps, suppresses small-scale
power, and delays galaxy formation via macroscopic quantum pressure. We compare the substructure
of galactic dark matter halos comprised of ultra-light axions to conventional CDM results. Besides
self-gravitating subhalos, FDM includes additional substructure in the form of non-virialized
over-dense wavelets formed by quantum interference patterns which provide a more efficient source
of heating to galactic discs than do subhalos. We find that, in the solar neighborhood, wavelet heating
is sufficient to give the oldest disc stars a velocity dispersion in excess of $30 \: \mathrm{km}
\: \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ within a Hubble time if energy is not lost from the disc. Furthermore, we calculate
the radius-dependent disc velocity dispersion and corresponding scale height caused by the heating
of dynamical substructure in both CDM and FDM with the determination that these effects will produce
a flaring that terminates the Milky Way disc at $15 - 20 \: \mathrm{kpc}$. Although the source of thickened
discs is not known, the heating due to perturbations caused by dark substructure cannot exceed the
total disc velocity dispersion. Therefore, this work provides a lower bound on the FDM particle
mass of $m_a > 0.63 \times 10^{-22} \mathrm{eV}$. Furthermore, FDM wavelets with particle mass
$m_a \sim 0.7 \times 10^{-22} \mathrm{eV}$ should be considered a viable mechanism for producing
the observed disc thickening with time.
