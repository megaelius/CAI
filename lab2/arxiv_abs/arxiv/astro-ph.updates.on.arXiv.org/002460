We compare simple analytical closure models of homogeneous turbulent Boussinesq convection for
stellar applications with three-dimensional simulations. We use simple analytical closure models
to compute the fluxes of angular momentum and heat as a function of rotation rate measured by the Taylor
number. We also investigate cases with varying angles between the angular velocity and gravity
vectors, corresponding to locating the computational domain at different latitudes ranging from
the pole to the equator of the star. We perform three-dimensional numerical simulations in the same
parameter regimes for comparison. The free parameters appearing in the closure models are calibrated
by two fitting methods using simulation data. Unique determination of the closure parameters is
possible only in the non-rotating case or when the system is placed at the pole. In the other cases
the fit procedures yield somewhat differing results. The quality of the closure is tested by substituting
the resulting coefficients back into the closure model and comparing with the simulation results.
To eliminate the possibilities that the results obtained depend on the aspect ratio of the simulation
domain or suffer from too small Rayleigh numbers we performed runs varying these parameters. The
simulation data for the Reynolds stress and heat fluxes broadly agree with previous compressible
simulations. The closure works fairly well with slow and fast rotation but its quality degrades
for intermediate rotation rates. We find that the closure parameters depend not only on rotation
rate but also on latitude. The weak dependence on Rayleigh number and the aspect ratio of the domain
indicates that our results are generally valid
