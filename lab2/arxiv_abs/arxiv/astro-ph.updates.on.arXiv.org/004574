We present a Bayesian analysis of the combination of current neutrino oscillation, neutrinoless
double beta decay and CMB observations. Our major goal is to carefully investigate the possibility
to single out one neutrino mass ordering, Normal Ordering or Inverted Ordering, with current data.
Two possible parametrizations (three neutrino masses versus the lightest neutrino mass plus the
two oscillation mass splittings) and priors (linear versus logarithmic) are examined. We find
that the preference for NO is only driven by neutrino oscillation data. Moreover, the values of the
Bayes factor indicate that the evidence for NO is strong only when the scan is performed over the three
neutrino masses with logarithmic priors; for every other combination of parameterization and
prior, the preference for NO is only weak. As a by-product of our Bayesian analyses, we are able to
a) compare the Bayesian bounds on the neutrino mixing parameters to those obtained by means of frequentist
approaches, finding a very good agreement; b) determine that the lightest neutrino mass plus the
two mass splittings parametrization, motivated by the physical observables, is strongly preferred
over the three neutrino mass eigenstates scan and c) find that there is a weak-to-moderate preference
for logarithmic priors. These results establish the optimal strategy to successfully explore
the neutrino parameter space, based on the use of the oscillation mass splittings and a logarithmic
prior on the lightest neutrino mass. We also show that the limits on the total neutrino mass $\sum
m_\nu$ can change dramatically when moving from one prior to the other. These results have profound
implications for future studies on the neutrino mass ordering, as they crucially state the need
for self-consistent analyses which explore the best parametrization and priors, without combining
results that involve different assumptions.
