In order to characterize the early growth of fine-grained dust rims (FGRs) that commonly surround
chondrules, we simulate the growth of FGRs through direct accretion of monomers of various sizes
onto the chondrule surfaces. Dust becomes charged to varying degrees in the radiative plasma environment
of the solar nebula (SN), and the resulting electrostatic force alters the trajectories of colliding
dust grains, influencing the structure of the dust rim as well as the time scale of rim formation.
We compare the growth of FGRs in protoplanetary disks (PPD) with different turbulence strengths
and plasma conditions to previous models which assumed neutral dust grains. We use a combination
of a Monte Carlo method and an N-body code to simulate the collision of dust monomers with chondrules:
a Monte Carlo algorithm is used to randomly select dust particles that will collide with the chondrule
as well as determine the elapsed time interval between collisions; at close approach, the detailed
collision process is modeled using an N-body algorithm, Aggregate Builder (AB), to determine the
collision outcome, as well as any restructuring of the chondrule rim. The collisions are driven
by Brownian motion and coupling to turbulent gas motion in the protoplanetary disk. The charge distribution
of the dust rim is modeled, used to calculate the trajectories of dust grains, and then analyze the
resulting morphology of the dust rim. In a weakly turbulent region, the decreased relative velocity
between charged particles causes small grains to be repelled from the chondrule, causing dust rims
to grow more slowly and be composed of larger monomers, which results in a more porous structure.
In a highly turbulent region, the presence of charge mainly affects the porosity of the rim by causing
dust particles to deviate from the extremities of the rim and reducing the amount of restructuring.
