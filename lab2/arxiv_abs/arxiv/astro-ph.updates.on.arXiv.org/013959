This work focuses on some key aspects of the General Relativistic (GR)-magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
applications in High-Energy Astrophysics. We discuss the relevance of the GR-HD counterparts
formulation exploring the geometrically thick disk models and constraints of the GR-MHD shaping
the physics of accreting configurations. Models of clusters of tori orbiting a central super-massive
black hole (SMBH) are described. These orbiting tori aggregates form sets of geometrically thick,
pressure supported, perfect fluid tori, associated to complex instability processes including
tori collision emergence and empowering a wide range of activities related expectantly to the embedding
matter environment of Active Galaxy Nuclei. Some notes are included on aggregates combined with
proto-jets, represented by open cusped solutions associated to the geometrically thick tori.
This exploration of some key concepts of the GR-MHD formulation in its applications to High-Energy
Astrophysics starts with the discussion of the initial data problem for a most general Einstein-Euler-Maxwell
system addressing the problem with a relativistic geometric background. The system is then set
in quasi linear hyperbolic form, and the reduction procedure is argumented. Then, considerations
follow on the analysis of the stability problem for self-gravitating systems with determined symmetries
considering the perturbations also of the geometry part on the quasi linear hyperbolic onset. Thus
we focus on the ideal GR-MHD and self-gravitating plasma ball. We conclude with the models of geometrically
thick GR-HD disks gravitating around a Kerr SMBH in their GR-HD formulation and including in the
force balance equation of the disks the influence of a toroidal magnetic field, determining its
impact in tori topology and stability
