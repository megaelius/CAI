The chance discovery of the first interstellar minor body, 1I/2017 U1 (`Oumuamua), indicates that
we may have been visited by such objects in the past and that these events may repeat in the future.
Unfortunately, minor bodies following nearly parabolic or hyperbolic paths tend to receive little
attention: over 3/4 of those known have data-arcs shorter than 30 d and, consistently, rather uncertain
orbit determinations. This fact suggests that we may have observed interstellar interlopers in
the past, but failed to recognize them as such due to insufficient data. Early identification of
promising candidates by using N-body simulations may help in improving this situation, triggering
follow-up observations before they leave the Solar system. Here, we use this technique to investigate
the pre- and post-perihelion dynamical evolution of the slightly hyperbolic comet C/2018 V1 (Machholz-Fujikawa-Iwamoto)
to understand its origin and relevance within the context of known parabolic and hyperbolic minor
bodies. Based on the available data, our calculations suggest that although C/2018 V1 may be a former
member of the Oort Cloud, an origin beyond the Solar system cannot be excluded. If extrasolar, it
might have entered the Solar system from interstellar space at low relative velocity with respect
to the Sun. The practical feasibility of this alternative scenario has been assessed within the
kinematic context of the stellar neighbourhood of the Sun, using data from Gaia second data release,
and two robust solar sibling candidates have been identified. Our results suggest that comets coming
from interstellar space at low heliocentric velocities may not be rare.
