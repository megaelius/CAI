One bottleneck for the exploitation of data from the $Kepler$ mission for stellar astrophysics
and exoplanet research has been the lack of precise radii and evolutionary states for most of the
observed stars. We report revised radii of 177,911 $Kepler$ stars derived by combining parallaxes
from $Gaia$ Data Release 2 with the DR25 $Kepler$ Stellar Properties Catalog. The median radius
precision is $\approx$ 8%, a typical improvement by a factor of 4-5 over previous estimates for typical
$Kepler$ stars. We find that $\approx$ 67% ($\approx$ 120,000) of all $Kepler$ targets are main-sequence
stars, $\approx$ 21% ($\approx$ 37,000) are subgiants, and $\approx$ 12% ($\approx$ 21,000) are
red giants, demonstrating that subgiant contamination is less severe than some previous estimates
and that Kepler targets are mostly main-sequence stars. Using the revised stellar radii, we recalculate
the radii for 2123 confirmed and 1922 candidate exoplanets. We confirm the presence of a gap in the
radius distribution of small, close-in planets, but find that the gap is mostly limited to incident
fluxes $>$ 200$F_\oplus$ and its location may be at a slightly larger radius (closer to $\approx$
2$R_\oplus$) when compared to previous results. Further, we find several confirmed exoplanets
occupying a previously-described "hot super-Earth desert" at high irradiance, show the relation
between gas-giant planet radius and incident flux, and establish a bona-fide sample of eight confirmed
planets and 30 planet candidates with $R_{\mathrm{p}}$ $<$ 2$R_\oplus$ in circumstellar "habitable
zones" (incident fluxes between 0.25--1.50 $F_\oplus$). The results presented here demonstrate
the potential for transformative characterization of stellar and exoplanet populations using
$Gaia$ data.
