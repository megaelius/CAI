Pluto has a heterogeneous surface, despite a global haze deposition rate of ~1 micrometer per orbit
(Cheng et al., 2017; Grundy et al., 2018). While there could be spatial variation in the deposition
rate, this has not yet been rigorously quantified, and naively the haze should coat the surface more
uniformly than was observed. One way (among many) to explain this contradiction is for atmospheric
pressure at the surface to drop low enough to interrupt haze production and stop the deposition of
particles onto part of the surface, driving heterogeneity. If the surface pressure drops to less
than 10^-3 - 10^-4 microbar and the CH4 mixing ratio remains nearly constant at the observed 2015
value, the atmosphere becomes transparent to ultraviolet radiation (Young et al., 2018), which
would shut off haze production at its source. If the surface pressure falls below 0.06 microbar,
the atmosphere ceases to be global, and instead is localized over only the warmest part of the surface,
restricting the location of deposition (Spencer et al., 1997). In Pluto's current atmosphere,
haze monomers collect together into aggregate particles at beginning at 0.5 microbar; if the surface
pressure falls below this limit, the appearance of particles deposited at different times of year
and in different locations could be different. We use VT3D, an energy balance model (Young, 2017),
to model the surface pressure on Pluto in current and past orbital configurations for four possible
static N2 ice distributions: the observed northern hemisphere distribution with (1) a bare southern
hemisphere, (2) a south polar cap, (3) a southern zonal band, and finally (4) a distribution that
is bare everywhere except inside the boundary of Sputnik Planitia. We also present a sensitivity
study showing the effect of mobile N2 ice...(cont.)
