CONTEXT: High-precision stellar analyses require hydrodynamic modeling to interpret chemical
abundances or oscillation modes. Exoplanet atmosphere studies require stellar background spectra
to be known along the transit path while detection of Earth analogs require stellar microvariability
to be understood. Hydrodynamic 3-D models can be computed for widely different stars but have been
tested in detail only for the Sun with its resolved surface features. Model predictions include
spectral line shapes, asymmetries, and wavelength shifts, and their center-to-limb changes across
stellar disks. AIMS: To observe high-resolution spectral line profiles across spatially highly
resolved stellar surfaces, which are free from the effects of spatial smearing and rotational broadening
present in full-disk spectra, enabling comparisons to synthetic profiles from 3-D models. METHODS:
During exoplanet transits, successive stellar surface portions become hidden and differential
spectroscopy between various transit phases provides spectra of small surface segments temporarily
hidden behind the planet. Planets cover no more than about 1% of any main-sequence star, enabling
high spatial resolution but demanding very precise observations. Realistically measurable quantities
are identified through simulated observations of synthetic spectral lines. RESULTS: In normal
stars, line profile ratios between various transit phases may vary by some 0.5%, requiring S/N ratios
of 5,000 or more for meaningful spectral reconstruction. While not yet realistic for individual
spectral lines, this is achievable for cool stars by averaging over numerous lines with similar
parameters. CONCLUSIONS: For bright host stars of large transiting planets, spatially resolved
spectroscopy is currently practical. More observable targets are likely to be found in the near
future by ongoing photometric searches.
