After the detection of gravitational waves caused by the coalescence of compact objects in the mass
range of neutron stars, GW170817, several studies have searched for an imprint of tidal effects
in the signal, employing different model assumptions. One important distinction is whether or
not to assume that both objects are neutron stars and obey the same equation of state. Some studies
assumed independent properties. Others assume a universal equation of state, and in addition that
the tidal deformability follows certain phenomenological relations. An important question is
whether the gravitational-wave data alone constitute observational evidence for finite tidal
effects. All studies provide Bayesian credible intervals, often without sufficiently discussing
the impact of prior assumptions, especially in the case of lower limits on the neutron-star tidal
deformability or radius. In this article, we scrutinize the implicit and explicit prior assumptions
made in those studies. Our findings strongly indicate that existing lower credible bounds are mainly
a consequence of prior assumptions combined with information gained about the system's masses.
Importantly, those lower bounds are typically not informed by the observation of tidal effects
in the gravitational-wave signal. Thus, regarding them as observational evidence might be misleading
without a more detailed discussion. Further, we point out technical problems and conceptual inconsistencies
in existing studies. We also assess the limitations due to systematic waveform model uncertainties
in a novel way, demonstrating that differences between existing models are not guaranteed to be
small enough for an unbiased estimation of lower bounds on the tidal deformability. Finally, we
propose strategies for gravitational-wave data analysis designed to avoid some of the problems
we uncovered.
