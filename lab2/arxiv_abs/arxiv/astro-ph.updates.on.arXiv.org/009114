The width of the broad emission lines in quasars is commonly characterized either by the full-width-at-half-maximum
(FWHM) or the square root of the second moment of the line profile ($\sigma_{\rm line}$), and used
as an indicator of the virial velocity of the broad-line region (BLR) in the estimation of black hole
(BH) mass. We measure FWHM and $\sigma_{\rm line}$ for H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and Mg II broad lines
in both the mean and root-mean-square (rms) spectra of a large sample of quasars from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping (SDSS-RM) project. We introduce a new quantitative recipe to
measure $\sigma_{\rm line}$ that is reproducible, less susceptible to noise and blending in the
wings, and scales with the intrinsic width of the line. We compare the four definitions of line width
(FWHM and $\sigma_{\rm line}$ in mean and rms spectra, respectively) for each of the three broad
lines and among different lines. There are strong correlations among different width definitions
for each line, as well as correlations among different lines. We further investigate the correlations
between virial BH masses using different line width definitions and the stellar velocity dispersion
of the host galaxies, and the dependence of line shape (characterized by the ratio FWHM/$\sigma_{\rm
line}$) on physical properties of the quasar. Our results provide further evidence that FWHM is
more sensitive to the orientation of a flattened BLR geometry than $\sigma_{\rm line}$, but the
overall comparison between the virial BH mass and host stellar velocity dispersion does not provide
conclusive evidence that one particular width definition is significantly better than the others.
