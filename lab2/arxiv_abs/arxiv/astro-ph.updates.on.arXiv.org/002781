We study the multi-dimensional properties of neutrino transfer inside supernova cores by solving
the Boltzmann equations for neutrino distribution functions in genuinely six dimensional (6D)
phase space. Adopting representative snapshots of the post-bounce core from other supernova simulations
in three dimensions, we solve the temporal evolutions to stationary states of neutrino distribution
functions by our Boltzmann solver. Taking advantage of the multi-angle and multi-energy feature
realized by the S$_n$ method in our code, we reveal the genuine characteristics of spatially three
dimensional (3D) neutrino transfer such as non-radial fluxes and non-diagonal Eddington tensors.
In addition, we assess the ray-by-ray approximation, turning off the lateral-transport terms
in our code. We demonstrate that the ray-by-ray approximation tends to propagate fluctuations
in thermodynamical states around the neutrino-sphere along each radial ray and overestimate the
variations between the neutrino distributions on different radial rays. We find that the difference
in the densities and fluxes of neutrinos between the ray-by-ray approximation and the full Boltzmann
transport becomes ~20%, which is also the case for the local heating rate, whereas the volume-integrated
heating rate in the Boltzmann transport is found to be only slightly larger (~2%) than the counterpart
in the ray-by-ray approximation due to cancellation among different rays. These results suggest
that we had better assess carefully the possible influences of various approximations in the neutrino
transfer employed in the current simulations on supernova dynamics. Detailed information on the
angle and energy moments of neutrino distribution functions will be profitable for the future development
of numerical methods in neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics.
