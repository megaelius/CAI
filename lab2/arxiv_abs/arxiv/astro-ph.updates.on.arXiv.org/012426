Present-day multi-wavelength deep imaging surveys allow to characterise the outskirts of galaxies
with unprecedented precision. Taking advantage of this situation, we define a new physically motivated
measurement of size for galaxies based on the expected location of the gas density threshold for
star formation. Employing both theoretical and observational arguments, we use the stellar mass
density contour at 1 $M_{\rm \odot}$ pc$^{-2}$ as a proxy for this density threshold for star formation.
This choice makes our size definition operative. With this new size measure, the intrinsic scatter
of the global stellar mass ($M_{\rm \star}$) - size relation (explored over five orders of magnitude
in stellar mass) decreases to $\sim$0.06 dex. This value is 2.5 times smaller than the scatter measured
using the effective radius ($\sim$0.15 dex) and between 1.5 and 1.8 times smaller than those using
other traditional size indicators such as $R_{\rm 23.5,i}$ ($\sim$0.09 dex), the Holmberg radius
$R_{\rm H}$ ($\sim$0.09 dex) and the half-mass radius $R_{\rm e,M_{\star}}$ ($\sim$0.11 dex).
Moreover, galaxies with 10$^7$ $M_{\rm \odot} <$ $M_{\star} < 10^{11}$ $M_{\rm \odot}$ increase
monotonically in size following a power-law with a slope very close to 1/3, equivalent to an average
stellar mass 3D density of $\sim$4.5$\times$10$^{-3}$ $M_{\rm \odot}$ pc$^{-3}$ for galaxies
within this mass range. Galaxies with $M_{\rm \star}$$>$10$^{11}$ $M_{\rm \odot}$ show a different
slope with stellar mass, which is suggestive of a larger gas density threshold for star formation
at the epoch when their star formation peaks.
