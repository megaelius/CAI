Context. Being the most numerous and oldest stars in the galaxy, M dwarfs are objects of great interest
for exoplanet searches. The presence of molecules in their atmosphere complicates our understanding
of their atmospheric properties. But great advances have recently been made in the modeling of M
dwarfs due to the revision of solar abundances. Aims. We aim to determine stellar parameters of M
dwarfs using high resolution spectra (R = 90 000) simultaneously in the visible and the near-infrared.
The high resolution spectra and broad wavelength coverage provide an unique opportunity to understand
the onset of dust and cloud formation at cool temperatures. Furthermore, this study will help in
understanding the physical processes which occur in a cool atmospheres, particularly, the redistribution
of energy from the optical to the near-infrared. Methods. The stellar parameters of M dwarfs in our
sample have been determined by comparing the high resolution spectra both in the optical and in the
near-infrared simultaneously observed by CARMENES with the synthetic spectra obtained from the
BT-Settl model atmosphere. The detailed spectral synthesis of these observed spectra both in the
optical and in the near-infrared helps to understand the missing continuum opacity. Results. For
the first time, we derive fundamental stellar parameters of M dwarfs using the high resolution optical
and near-infrared spectra simultaneously. We determine Teff , log g and [M/H] for 292 M dwarfs of
spectral type M0 to M9, where the formation of dust and clouds are important. The derived Teff for
the sample ranges from 2300 to 4000 K, values of log g ranges from 4.5 geq log g leq 5.5 and the resulting
metallicity ranges from -0.5 geq [M/H] leq +0.5. We have also explored the possible differences
in Teff , log g and [M/H] by comparing them with other studies of the same sample of M dwarfs.
