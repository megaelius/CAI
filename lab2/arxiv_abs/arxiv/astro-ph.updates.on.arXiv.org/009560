The initial conditions for the mass loss during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase are set in
their extended atmospheres, where, among others, convection and pulsation driven shocks determine
the physical conditions. High resolution observations of AGB stars at (sub)millimetre wavelengths
can now directly determine the morphology, activity, density, and temperature close to the stellar
photosphere. We used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) high angular resolution
observations to resolve the extended atmospheres of four of the nearest AGB stars: W Hya, Mira A,
R Dor and R Leo. We interpreted the observations using a parameterised atmosphere model. We resolve
all four AGB stars and determine the brightness temperature structure between $1$ and $2$ stellar
radii. For W Hya and R Dor we confirm the existence of hotspots with brightness temperatures $>3000$
to $10000$~K. All four stars show deviations from spherical symmetry. We find variations on a timescale
of days to weeks, and for R Leo we directly measure an outward motion of the millimetre wavelength
surface with a velocity of at least $10.6\pm1.4$~km~s$^{-1}$. For all objects but W Hya we find that
the temperature-radius and size-frequency relations require the existence of a (likely inhomogeneous)
layer of enhanced opacity. The ALMA observations provide a unique probe of the structure of the extended
AGB atmosphere. We find highly variable structures of hotspots and likely convective cells. In
the future, these observations can be directly compared to multi-dimensional chromosphere and
atmosphere models that determine the temperature, density, velocity, and ionisation structure
between the stellar photosphere and the dust formation region. However, our results show that for
the best interpretation, both very accurate flux calibration and near-simultaneous observations
are essential.
