Fossil record methods based on spectral synthesis techniques have matured over the past decade,
and their application to integrated galaxy spectra fostered substantial advances on the understanding
of galaxies and their evolution. Yet, because of the lack of spatial resolution, these studies are
limited to a global view, providing no information about the internal physics of galaxies. Motivated
by the CALIFA survey, which is gathering Integral Field Spectroscopy over the full optical extent
of 600 galaxies, we have developed an end-to-end pipeline which: (i) partitions the observed data
cube into Voronoi zones in order to, when necessary and taking due account of correlated errors,
increase the S/N, (ii) extracts spectra, including propagated errors and bad-pixel flags, (iii)
feeds the spectra into the STARLIGHT spectral synthesis code, (iv) packs the results for all galaxy
zones into a single file, (v) performs a series of post-processing operations, including zone-to-pixel
image reconstruction and unpacking the spectral and stellar population properties into multi-dimensional
time, metallicity, and spatial coordinates. This paper provides an illustrated description of
this whole pipeline and its products. Using data for the nearby spiral NGC 2916 as a show case, we go
through each of the steps involved, presenting ways of visualizing and analyzing this manifold.
These include 2D maps of properties such as the v-field, stellar extinction, mean ages and metallicities,
mass surface densities, star formation rates on different time scales and normalized in different
ways, 1D averages in the temporal and spatial dimensions, projections of the stellar light and mass
growth (x,y,t) cubes onto radius-age diagrams, etc. The results illustrate the richness of the
combination of IFS data with spectral synthesis, providing a glimpse of what is to come from CALIFA
and future surveys. (Abridged)
