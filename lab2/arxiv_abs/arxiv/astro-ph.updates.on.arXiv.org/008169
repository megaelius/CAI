We present the first results of cosmic ray (CR) feedback implemented in the Feedback In Realistic
Environments (FIRE) simulations. We investigate CR feedback in non-cosmological simulations
of dwarf, sub-$L\star$ starburst, and $L\star$ galaxies with different propagation models, including
advection, isotropic and anisotropic diffusion, and streaming along field lines with different
transport coefficients. We simulate CR diffusion and streaming simultaneously in galaxies with
high resolution, using a newly-developed two moment method. We forward-model and compare to observations
of $\gamma$-ray emission from nearby and starburst galaxies. We reproduce the $\gamma$-ray observations
with constant isotropic diffusion coefficients $\kappa \sim 3\times 10^{28-29}\,{\rm cm^{2}\,s^{-1}}$.
Advection-only and streaming-only models (even allowing for super-Alfvenic streaming speeds)
produce order-of-magnitude too large $\gamma$-ray luminosities in dwarf and $L\star$ galaxies.
We show that in models that match the $\gamma$-ray observations, most CRs escape low-gas-density
galaxies (e.g.\ dwarfs) before significant collisional losses, while starburst galaxies are
CR proton calorimeters. While adiabatic losses can be significant, they occur only after CRs escape
galaxies, so they are only of secondary importance for $\gamma$-ray emissivities. Models where
CRs are "trapped" in the star-forming disk have lower star formation efficiency, but these models
are ruled out by $\gamma$-ray observations. For models with constant $\kappa$ that match the $\gamma$-ray
observations, CRs form extended halos with scale heights of several kpc to several tens of kpc.
