We use high spatial resolution stellar velocity maps from the Gemini GMOS integral-field spectrograph
(IFS) and wide-field velocity maps from the McDonald Mitchell IFS to study the stellar velocity
profiles and kinematic misalignments from $\sim 200$ pc to $\sim 20$ kpc in 20 early-type galaxies
with stellar mass $M_* > 10^{11.7} M_\odot$ in the MASSIVE survey. While 80% of the galaxies have
low spins ($\lambda < 0.1$) and low rotational velocities ($< 50$ km/s) in both the central region
and the main body, we find a diverse range of velocity features and misalignment angles. For the 18
galaxies with measurable central kinematic axes, 10 have well aligned kinematic axis and photometric
major axis, and the other 8 galaxies have misalignment angles that are distributed quite evenly
from $15^\circ$ to the maximal value of $90^\circ$. There is a strong correlation between central
kinematic misalignment and galaxy spin, where all 4 galaxies with significant spins have well aligned
kinematic and photometric axes, but only 43% of the low-spin galaxies are well aligned. The central
and main-body kinematic axes within a galaxy are not always aligned. When the two kinematic axes
are aligned ($\sim 60$% of the cases), they are either also aligned with the photometric major axis
or orthogonal to it. We find 13 galaxies to also exhibit noticeable local kinematic twists, and one
galaxy to have a counter-rotating core. A diverse assembly history consisting of multiple gas-poor
mergers of a variety of progenitor mass ratios and orbits is likely to be needed to account for the
predominance of low spins and the wide range of central and main-body velocity features reported
here for local massive ETGs.
