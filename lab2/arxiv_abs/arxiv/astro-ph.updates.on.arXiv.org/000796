Using the Solar Optical Observing Network (SOON) sunspot-group data for the period 1985-2010,
the variations in the annual mean equatorial-rotation rates of the sunspot groups are determined
and compared with the known variations in the solar equatorial-rotation rates determined from
the following data: i) the plasma rotation rates at 0.94Rsun, 0.95Rsun,...,1.0Rsun measured by
Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) during the period 1995-2010, ii) the data on the soft X-ray
corona determined from Yohkoh/SXT full disk images for the years 1992-2001, iii) the data on small
bright coronal structures (SBCS) which were traced in Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)/EIT
images during the period 1998-2006, and iv) the Mount Wilson Doppler-velocity measurements during
the period 1986-2007. A large portion (up to approximate 30 deg latitude) of the mean differential-rotation
profile of the sunspot groups lies between those of the internal differential-rotation rates at
0.94Rsun and 0.98Rsun.The variation in the yearly mean equatorial-rotation rate of the sunspot
groups seems to be lagging that of the equatorial-rotation rate determined from the GONG measurements
by one to two years.The amplitude of the latter is very small.The solar-cycle variation in the equatorial-rotation
rate of the solar corona closely matches that determined from the sunspot-group data.The variation
in the equatorial-rotation rate determined from the Mount Wilson Doppler-velocity data closely
resembles the corresponding variation in the equatorial-rotation rate determined from the sunspot-group
data that included the values of the abnormal angular motions (> 3 deg per day) of the sunspot groups.
Implications of these results are pointed out.
