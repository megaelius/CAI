Aims.We study the dependence of the halo abundance function (AF) on different environments in a
whole-sky $\Lambda$CDM light-cone halo catalogue extending to z < 0.65, using a simple and well-defined
halo isolation criterion. Methods. The isolation status of each individual dark matter halo is
determined by the distance to its nearest neighbour, which defines the maximum spherical region
devoid of halos above a threshold mass around it (although the true size of such region may be much
larger since it is not necessarily spherical). A versatile double power-law Schechter function
is used to fit the dark matter halo AF, and its derived parameters are studied as a function of halo
isolation status. Results. (a) Our function fits the halo abundances for all halo isolation statuses
extremely well, while the well-established theoretical mass functions, integrated over the volume
of the light-cone, provide an adequate but poorer fit than our phenomenological model. (b) As expected,
and in agreement with other studies based on snap-shot simulations, we find significant differences
of the halo abundance function as a function of halo isolation, indicating different rates of halo
formation. The slope of the power law and the characteristic mass of the Schechter-like fitting
function decrease with isolation, a result consistent with the formation of less massive haloes
in lower density regions. (c) We find an unexpected upturn of the characteristic mass of the most
isolated haloes of our sample. This upturn originates and characterises only the higher redshift
regime (z > 0.45), which probably implies a significant and recent evolution of the isolation status
of the most isolated and most massive haloes.
