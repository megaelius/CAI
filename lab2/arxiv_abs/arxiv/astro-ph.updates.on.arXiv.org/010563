Jupiter Trojan asteroids are minor bodies that share Jupiter's orbit around the Sun. Although not
yet well understood in origin and composition, they have surface properties that, besides being
comparable with other populations of small bodies in the Solar System, hold information that may
restrict models of planetary formation. Due their importance, there has been a significant increase
in an interest in studying this population. In this context arises the NASA Lucy Mission, with a planned
launch of 2021. The Lucy Mission will be the first one to address a group of 6 objects with the aim of
investigating, in detail, their nature. In order to provide valuable information for mission planning
and maximize the scientific return, we carried out ground based observations of four targets of
the mission. Aimed at looking for variabilities on the spectra of (3548) Eurybates, (15094) Polymele
and (21900) Orus, we performed rotationally resolved visible spectroscopy of them at SOAR Telescope.
We also analyzed the first visible spectrum obtained for the main belt asteroid (52246) Donaldjohanson
at Gran Telescopio Canarias. The spectra of Orus and Polymele present rather homogeneous characteristics
along the surfaces, and their taxa correspond with those of the two dominant populations in the Trojan
population, the P- and the D-type group of objects. Spectroscopy of Eurybates, on the other side,
suggests that some variation on the characteristics of the reflectance of this body could be related
with its collisional history. Donaldjohanson, the only main belt object in the group of targets,
shows, according to our visible spectrum, hints of the presence of hydrated materials. Lucy mission
will investigate the surface composition of these targets and will shed light on their connections
with other minor bodies populations and in their role on the evolution of the Solar System.
