Given the limited availability of direct evidence (pre-explosion observations) for supernova
(SN) progenitors, the location of supernovae (SNe) within their host galaxies can be used to set
limits on one of their most fundamental characteristics, their initial progenitor mass. We present
our constraints on SN progenitors derived by comparing the radial distributions of 80 SNe in the
SINGG and SUNGG surveys to the R-band, Halpha, and UV light distributions of the 55 host galaxies.
The strong correlation of Type Ia SNe with R-band light is consistent with models containing only
low mass progenitors, reflecting earlier findings. When we limit the analysis of Type II SNe to apertures
containing 90 per cent of the total flux, the radial distribution of these SNe best traces far ultraviolet
(FUV) emission, consistent with recent direct detections indicating Type II SNe have moderately
massive red supergiant progenitors. Stripped Envelope (SE) SNe have the strongest correlation
with Halpha fluxes, indicative of very massive progenitors (M* > 20 M_solar). This result contradicts
a small, but growing, number of direct detections of SE SN progenitors indicating they are moderately
massive binary systems. Our result is consistent, however, with a recent population analysis suggesting
binary SE SN progenitor masses are regularly underestimated. SE SNe are centralised with respect
to Type II SNe and there are no SE SNe recorded beyond half the maximum disc radius in the optical and
one third the disc radius in the ultraviolet. The absence of SE SNe beyond these distances is consistent
with reduced massive star formation efficiencies in the outskirts of the host galaxies.
