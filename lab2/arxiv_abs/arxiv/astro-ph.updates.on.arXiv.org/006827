Simultaneous observations of PSR B0823+26 with ESA's XMM-Newton, the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope
and international stations of the Low Frequency Array revealed synchronous X-ray/radio switching
between a radio-bright (B) mode and a radio-quiet (Q) mode. During the B mode we detected PSR B0823+26
in 0.2$-$2 keV X-rays and discovered pulsed emission with a broad sinusoidal pulse, lagging the
radio main pulse by 0.208 $\pm$ 0.012 in phase, with high pulsed fraction of 70$-$80%. During the
Q mode PSR B0823+26 was not detected in X-rays (2 $\sigma$ upper limit a factor ~9 below the B-mode
flux). The total X-ray spectrum, pulse profile and pulsed fraction can globally be reproduced with
a magnetized partially ionized hydrogen atmosphere model with three emission components: a primary
small hot spot ($T$$\sim$3.6$\times10^6$ K, $R$$\sim$17 m), a larger cooler concentric ring ($T$$\sim$1.1$\times10^6$
K, $R$$\sim$280 m) and an antipodal hot spot ($T$$\sim$1.1$\times10^6 $ K, $R$$\sim$100 m), for
the angle between the rotation axis and line of sight direction $\sim66^\circ$. The latter is in
conflict with the radio derived value of $(84\pm0.7)^\circ$. The average X-ray flux within hours-long
B-mode intervals varied by a factor $\pm$20%, possibly correlated with variations in the frequency
and lengths of short radio nulls or short durations of weak emission. The correlated X-ray/radio
moding of PSR B0823+26 is compared with the anti-correlated moding of PSR B0943+10, and the lack
of X-ray moding of PSR B1822-09. We speculate that the X-ray/radio switches of PSR B0823+26 are due
to variations in the rate of accretion of material from the interstellar medium through which it
is passing.
