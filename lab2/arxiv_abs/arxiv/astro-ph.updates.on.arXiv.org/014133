In the era of precision cosmology, establishing the correct magnitude of statistical errors in
cosmological parameters is of crucial importance. However, widely used approximations in galaxy
surveys analyses can lead to parameter uncertainties that are grossly mis-estimated. These approximations
can be introduced at three different levels: in the form of the likelihood, in the theoretical modelling
of the observable and in the numerical computation of the observable. Their consequences are important
both in data analysis through e.g., Markov Chain Monte Carlo parameter inference, and when survey
instrument and strategy are designed and their constraining power on cosmological parameters
is forecasted, for instance using Fisher matrix analyses. In this work, considering the galaxy
angular power spectrum as the target observable, we report one example for each of such three categories
and derive their impact on the estimated parameters uncertainties and degeneracies. We show that
there are cases where these commonly used approximations lead, perhaps counter-intuitively,
to unacceptably large mis-estimates of parameters errors and correlations. Furthermore, we stress
how these approximations might even spoil the benefits of the nascent multi-tracer and multi-messenger
cosmology. Hence we recommend that the type of analysis presented here should be repeated for every
approximation adopted in survey design or data analysis, to quantify how it may affect the results.
To this aim, we have developed \texttt{Multi\_CLASS}, a new extension of \texttt{CLASS} that includes
the angular power spectrum for multiple (galaxy and other tracers such as gravitational waves)
populations. The public release of \texttt{Multi\_CLASS} is associated with this paper.
