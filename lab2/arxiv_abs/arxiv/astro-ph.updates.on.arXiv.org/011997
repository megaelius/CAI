We have carried out follow-up spectroscopy on three overdense regions of $g$- and $r$-dropout galaxies
in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey Deep Fields, finding two new protoclusters
at $z=4.898$, 3.721 and a possible protocluster at $z=3.834$. The $z=3.721$ protocluster overlaps
with a previously identified protocluster at $z=3.675$. The redshift separation between these
two protoclusters is $\Delta z=0.05$, which is slightly larger than the size of typical protoclusters.
Therefore, if they are not the progenitors of a $>10^{15}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ halo, they would
grow into closely-located independent halos like a supercluster. The other protocluster at $z=4.898$
is also surrounded by smaller galaxy groups. These systems including protoclusters and neighboring
groups are regarded as the early phase of superclusters. We quantify the spatial distribution of
member galaxies of the protoclusters at $z=3.675$ and 3.721 by fitting triaxial ellipsoids, finding
a tentative difference: one has a pancake-like shape while the other is filamentary. This could
indicate that these two protoclusters are in different stages of formation. We investigate the
relation between redshift and the velocity dispersion of protoclusters, including other protoclusters
from the literature, in order to compare their dynamical states. Although there is no significant
systematic trend in the velocity dispersions of protoclusters with redshift, the distribution
is skewed to higher velocity dispersion over the redshift range of $z=2\mathrm{-}6$. This could
be interpreted as two phases of cluster formation, one dominated by the steady accretion of galaxies,
and the other by the merging between group-size halos, perhaps depending on the surrounding large-scale
environments.
