NGC6240 is a well-studied nearby galaxy system in the process of merging. Based on optical, X-ray,
and radio observations, it is thought to harbor two active nuclei We carried out a detailed optical
3D spectroscopic study to investigate the inner region of this system in connection with existing
MERLIN and VLBA data. We observed NGC6240 with very high spatial resolution using the MUSE instrument
in the Narrow-Field Mode with the four-laser GALACSI adaptive optics system on the ESO VLT under
seeing conditions of 0.49 arcsec. Our 3D spectra cover the wavelength range from 4725 to 9350 AA at
a spatial resolution of ~75 mas. We report the discovery of three nuclei in the final state of merging
within a region of only 1 kpc in the NGC6240 system.Thanks to MUSE we are able to show that the formerly
unresolved southern component actually consists of two distinct nuclei separated by only 198 pc.
In combination with Gaia data we reach an absolute positional accuracy of only 30 mas that is essential
to compare optical spectra with MERLIN and VLBA radio positions. The verification and detailed
study of a system with three nuclei, two of which are active and each with a mass in excess of $9\times10^{7}
M_{\odot}$, is of great importance for the understanding of hierarchical galaxy formation via
merging processes since multiple mergers lead to a faster evolution of massive galaxies in comparison
to binary mergers. So far it has been suggested that the formation of galactic nuclei with multiple
supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is expected to be rare in the local universe.Triple massive black
hole systems might be of fundamental importance for the coalescence of massive black hole binaries
in less than a Hubble time leading to the loudest sources of gravitational waves in the millihertz
regime.
