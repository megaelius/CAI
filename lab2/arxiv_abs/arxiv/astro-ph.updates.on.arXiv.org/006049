Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are thought to play a critical role in shaping galaxies, but their effect
on the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is not well studied. We present results from the COS-AGN survey:
19 quasar sightlines that probe the CGM of 20 optically-selected AGN host galaxies with impact parameters
$80 < \rho_{imp} < 300$ kpc. Absorption lines from a variety of species are measured and compared
to a stellar mass and impact parameter matched sample of sightlines through non-AGN galaxies. Amongst
the observed species in the COS-AGN sample (HI, CII, SiII, SiIII, CIV, SiIV, NV), only Ly$\alpha$
shows a high covering fraction ($94^{+6}_{-23}$% for rest-frame equivalent widths EW $> 124$ m\AA)
whilst many of the metal ions are not detected in individual sightlines. A sightline-by-sightline
comparison between COS-AGN and the control sample yields no significant difference in EW distribution.
However, stacked spectra of the COS-AGN and control samples show significant (> 3 sigma) enhancements
in the EW of both Ly$\alpha$ and SiIII at impact parameters $> 164$ kpc by a factor of $+0.45\pm0.05$
dex and $> +0.75$ dex respectively. The lack of detections of both high-ionization species near
the AGN and strong kinematic offsets between the absorption systemic galaxy redshifts indicates
that neither the AGN's ionization nor its outflows are the origin of these differences. Instead,
we suggest the observed differences could result from either AGN hosts residing in haloes with intrinsically
distinct gas properties, or that their CGM has been affected by a previous event, such as a starburst,
which may also have fuelled the nuclear activity.
