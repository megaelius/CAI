We use galaxy dynamical information to calibrate the richness-mass scaling relation of a sample
of 428 galaxy clusters that are members of the CODEX sample with redshifts up to z~0.7. These clusters
were X-ray selected using the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS), cross-matched to associated systems
in the redMaPPer catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The spectroscopic sample we analyze
was obtained in the SPIDERS program and contains ~7800 red member galaxies. Adopting NFW mass and
galaxy density profiles and a broad range of orbital anisotropy profiles, we use the Jeans equation
to calculate halo masses. Modeling the scaling relation as $\lambda \propto \text{A}_{\lambda}
{M_{\text{200c}}}^{\text{B}_{\lambda}} ({1+z})^{\gamma_{\lambda}}$, we find the parameter
constraints $\text{A}_{\lambda}=38.6^{+3.1}_{-4.1}\pm3.9$, $\text{B}_{\lambda}=0.99^{+0.06}_{-0.07}\pm0.04$,
and $\gamma_{\lambda}=-1.13^{+0.32}_{-0.34}\pm0.49$. We find good agreement with previously
published mass trends with the exception of those from stacked weak lensing analyses. We note that
although the lensing analyses failed to account for the Eddington bias, this is not enough to explain
the differences. We suggest that differences in the levels of contamination between pure redMaPPer
and RASS+redMaPPer samples could well contribute to these differences. The redshift trend we measure
is more negative than but statistically consistent with previous results. We suggest that our measured
redshift trend reflects a change in the cluster galaxy red sequence fraction with redshift, noting
that the trend we measure is consistent with but somewhat stronger than an independently measured
redshift trend in the red sequence fraction. We also examine the impact of a plausible model of correlated
scatter in X-ray luminosity and optical richness, showing it has negligible impact on our results.
