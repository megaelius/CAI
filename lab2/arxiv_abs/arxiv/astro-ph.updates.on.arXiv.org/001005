The dense cloud associated with W40, one of the nearby H II regions, has been studied in millimeter-wave
molecular lines and in 1.2 mm continuum. Besides, 1280 MHz and 610 MHz interferometric observations
have been done. The cloud has complex morphological and kinematical structure, including a clumpy
dust ring and an extended dense core. The ring is probably formed by the "collect and collapse" process
due to the expansion of neighboring H II region. Nine dust clumps in the ring have been deconvolved.
Their sizes, masses and peak hydrogen column densities are: $\sim 0.02-0.11$ pc, $\sim 0.4-8.1
M_{\odot}$ and $\sim (2.5-11)\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively. Molecular lines are observed
at two different velocities and have different spatial distributions implying strong chemical
differentiation over the region. The CS abundance is enhanced towards the eastern dust clump 2,
while the NH$_3$, N$_2$H$^+$, and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ abundances are enhanced towards the western
clumps. HCN and HCO$^+$ do not correlate with the dust probably tracing the surrounding gas. Number
densities derived towards selected positions are: $\sim (0.3-3.2)\times 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$. Two
western clumps have kinetic temperatures 21 K and 16 K and are close to virial equilibrium. The eastern
clumps 2 and 3 are more massive, have higher extent of turbulence and are probably more evolved than
the western ones. They show asymmetric CS(2--1) line profiles due to infalling motions which is
confirmed by model calculations. An interaction between ionized and neutral material is taking
place in the vicinity of the eastern branch of the ring and probably trigger star formation.
