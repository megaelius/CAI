We investigate how the splitting of the leading sunspot and associated flux emergence and cancellation
in active region NOAA 11515 caused an eruptive M5.6 flare on 2012 July 2. Our study employs multi-wavelength
observations from HMI, AIA and ChroTel. Emerging flux formed a neutral line ahead of the leading
sunspot and new satellite spots. The sunspot splitting caused a long-lasting flow toward this neutral
line, where a filament formed. Further flux emergence, partly of mixed-polarity, as well as episodes
of flux cancellation occurred repeatedly at the neutral line. Following a nearby C-class precursor
flare with signs of interaction with the filament, the filament erupted nearly simultaneously
with the onset of the M5.6 flare and evolved into a coronal mass ejection. The sunspot stretched without
forming a light bridge, splitting unusually fast (within about a day, complete approximately 6
hours after the eruption) in two nearly equal parts. The front part separated strongly from the active
region to approach the neighbouring active region where all its coronal magnetic connections were
rooted. It also rotated rapidly (by 4.9 degree/hr) and caused significant shear flows at its edge.
The eruption resulted from a complex sequence of processes in the (sub-)photosphere and corona.
The persistent flows toward the neutral line likely caused the formation of a flux rope which held
the filament. These flows and their associated flux cancellation, the emerging flux, and the precursor
flare all contributed to the destabilization of the flux rope. We interpret the sunspot splitting
as the separation of two flux bundles differently rooted in the convection zone and only temporarily
joined in the spot. This explains the rotation as continued rise of the separating flux and implies
that at least this part of the sunspot was still connected to its roots deep in the convection zone.
