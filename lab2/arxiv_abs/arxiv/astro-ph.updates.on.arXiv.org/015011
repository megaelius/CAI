Imaging circumstellar disks in the near-infrared provides unprecedented information about the
formation and evolution of planetary systems. However, current post-processing techniques for
high-contrast imaging have a limited sensitivity to extended signals and their morphology is often
plagued with strong morphological distortions. Moreover, it is challenging to disentangle planetary
signals from the disk when the two components are closed or intertwined. We propose a pipeline that
is capable of detecting a wide variety of disks and preserving their shapes and flux distributions.
By construction, our approach separates planets from disks. After analyzing the distortions induced
by the current angular differential imaging (ADI) post-processing techniques, we establish a
direct model of the different components constituting a temporal sequence of high-contrast images.
In an inverse problem framework, we jointly estimate the starlight residuals and the potential
extended sources and point sources hidden in the images, using low-complexity priors for each signal.
To verify and estimate the performance of our approach, we tested it on VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS data, in
which we injected synthetic disks and planets. We also applied our approach on observations containing
real disks. Our technique makes it possible to detect disks from ADI datasets of a contrast above
$3\times10^{-6}$ with respect to the host star. As no specific shape of the disks is assumed, we are
capable of extracting a wide diversity of disks, including face-on disks. The intensity distribution
of the detected disk is accurately preserved and point sources are distinguished, even close to
the disk.
