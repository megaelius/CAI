[abridged] We present the results of a pilot study for the extended MACS survey (eMACS), a comprehensive
search for distant, X-ray luminous galaxy clusters at z>0.5. Our pilot study applies the eMACS
concept to the 71 deg^2 area extended by the ten fields of the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) Medium Deep Survey
(MDS). Candidate clusters are identified by visual inspection of PS1 images in the g,r, i, and z bands
in a 5x5 arcmin^2 region around X-ray sources detected in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS). To test
and optimize the eMACS X-ray selection criteria, our pilot study uses the largest possible RASS
database, i.e., all RASS sources listed in the Bright and Faint Source Catalogs (BSC and FSC) that
fall within the MDS footprint. Scrutiny of PS1/MDS images for 41 BSC and 200 FSC sources combined
with dedicated spectroscopic follow-up observations results in a sample of 11 clusters with estimated
or spectroscopic redshifts of z>0.3. X-ray follow-up observations will be crucial in order
to establish robust cluster luminosities for eMACS clusters. Although the small number of distant
X-ray luminous clusters in the MDS does not allow us to make firm predictions for the over 20,000 deg^2
of extragalactic sky covered by eMACS, the identification of two extremely promising eMACS cluster
candidates at z>0.6 (both yet to be observed with Chandra) in such a small solid angle is encouraging.
Representing a tremendous gain over the presently known two dozen such systems from X-ray, optical,
and SZ cluster surveys combined, the sample of over 100 extremely massive clusters at z>0.5 expected
from eMACS would be invaluable for the identification of the most powerful gravitational lenses
in the Universe, as well as for in-depth and statistical studies of the physical properties of the
most massive galaxy clusters out to z~1.
