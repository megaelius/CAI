The galaxy Luminosity Function (LF) is a key observable for galaxy formation, evolution studies
and for cosmology. In this work, we propose a novel technique to forward model wide-field broad-band
galaxy surveys using the fast image simulator UFig and measure the LF of galaxies in the B-band. We
use Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to constrain the galaxy population model parameters
of the simulations and match data from CFHTLS. We define a number of distance metrics between the
simulated and the survey data. By exploring the parameter space of the galaxy population model through
ABC to find the set of parameters that minimize these distance metrics, we obtain constraints on
the LFs of blue and red galaxies as a function of redshift. We find that $\mathrm{M^*}$ fades by $\Delta
\mathrm{M}^*_{\mathrm{0.1-1.0,b}} = 0.68 \pm 0.52$ and $\Delta \mathrm{M}^*_{\mathrm{0.1-1.0,r}}
= 0.54 \pm 0.48$ magnitudes between redshift $\mathrm{z = 1}$ and $\mathrm{z = 0.1}$ for blue and
red galaxies, respectively. We also find that $\phi^*$ for blue galaxies stays roughly constant
between redshift $\mathrm{z = 0.1}$ and $\mathrm{z=1}$, while for red galaxies it decreases by
$\sim 35\%$. We compare our results to other measurements, finding good agreement at all redshifts,
for both blue and red galaxies. To further test our results, we compare the redshift distributions
for survey and simulated data. We use the spectroscopic redshift distribution from the VIMOS Public
Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS) and we apply the same selection in colours and magnitudes
on our simulations. We find a good agreement between the survey and the simulated redshift distributions.
We provide best-fit values and uncertainties for the parameters of the LF. This work offers excellent
prospects for measuring other galaxy population properties as a function of redshift using ABC.
