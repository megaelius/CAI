Supermassive black holes are commonly found in the center of galaxies and evolve with their hosts.
The supermassive binary black holes (SMBBH) are thus expected to exist in close galaxy pairs, however,
none has been unequivocally detected. The square kilometre array (SKA) is a multi-purpose radio
telescope with a collecting area approaching 1 million square metres, with great potential for
detecting nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper, we quantify the GW detectability
by SKA for a realistic SMBBH population using pulsar timing array (PTA) technique and quantify its
impact on revealing SMBBH evolution with redshift for the first time. With only $\sim20$ pulsars,
much smaller a requirement than in previous work, the SKA PTA is expected to obtain detection within
about 5 years of operation and to achieve a detection rate of more than 100 SMBBHs/yr after about 10
years. Although beyond the scope of this paper, we must acknowledge that the presence of persistent
red noise will reduce the number of expected detections here. It is thus imperative to understand
and mitigate red noise in the PTA data. The GW signatures from a few well-known SMBBH candidates,
such as OJ 287, 3C 66B, NGC 5548 and Ark 120, will be detected given the currently best-known parameters
of each system. Within 30 years of operation, about 60 individual SMBBHs detection with $z<0.05$
and more than $10^4$ with $z<1$ are expected. The detection rate drops precipitately beyond $z=1$
and completely cuts off at $z > 2$, primarily due to their expected long orbital periods. The substantial
number of expected detections and their discernible evolution with redshift by SKA PTA will make
SKA a significant tool for studying SMBBHs.
