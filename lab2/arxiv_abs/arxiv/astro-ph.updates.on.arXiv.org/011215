In recent years, the amplitude of matter fluctuations inferred from low-redshift probes has been
found to be generally lower than the value derived from CMB observations in the $\Lambda$CDM model.
This tension has been exemplified by Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and X-ray cluster counts which, when using
their Planck standard cluster mass calibration, yield a value of $\sigma_8$ , appreciably lower
than estimations based on the latest Planck CMB measurements. In this work we examine whether non-minimal
neutrino masses can alleviate this tension substantially. We used the cluster X-ray temperature
distribution function derived from a flux-limited sample of local X-ray clusters, combined with
Planck CMB measurements. These datasets were compared to $\Lambda$CDM predictions based on recent
mass function, adapted to account for the effects of massive neutrinos. Treating the clusters mass
calibration as a free parameter, we examined whether the data favours neutrino masses appreciably
higher than the minimal 0.06 eV value. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, we found no significant
correlation between the mass calibration of clusters and the sum of neutrino masses, meaning that
massive neutrinos do not noticeably alleviate the above-mentioned Planck CMB--clusters tension.
The addition of other datasets (BAO and Ly-$\alpha$) reinforces those conclusions. As an alternative
possible solution to the tension, we introduced a simple, phenomenological modification of gravity
by letting the growth index $\gamma$ vary as an additional free parameter. We find that the cluster
mass calibration is robustly correlated with the $\gamma$ parameter, insensitively to the presence
of massive neutrinos or/and additional data used. We conclude that the standard Planck mass calibration
of clusters, if consolidated, would represent evidence for new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM with
massive neutrinos.
