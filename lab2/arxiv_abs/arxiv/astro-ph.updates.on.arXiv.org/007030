Context. Comparison studies of Sun-like stars with the Sun suggest an anomalously low photometric
variability of the Sun compared to Sun-like stars with similar magnetic activity. Comprehensive
understanding of stellar variability is needed, to find a physical reasoning for this observation.
Aims. We investigate the effect of metallicity and effective temperature on the photometric brightness
change of Sun-like stars seen at different inclinations. The considered range of fundamental stellar
parameters is sufficiently small so the stars, investigated here, still count as Sun-like or even
as solar twins. Methods. To model the brightness change of stars with solar magnetic activity, we
extend a well established model of solar brightness variations, SATIRE (which stands for Spectral
And Total Irradiance Reconstruction), which is based on solar spectra, to stars with different
fundamental parameters. For that we calculate stellar spectra for different metallicities and
effective temperature using the radiative transfer code ATLAS9. Results. We show that even a small
change (e.g. within the observational error range) of metallicity or effective temperature significantly
affects the photometric brightness change compared to the Sun. We find that for Sun-like stars,
the amplitude of the brightness variations obtained for Str\"omgren (b + y)/2 reaches a local minimum
for fundamental stellar parameters close to the solar metallicity and effective temperature.
Moreover, our results show that the effect of inclination decreases for metallicity values greater
than the solar metallicity. Overall, we find that an exact determination of fundamental stellar
parameters is crucially important for understanding stellar brightness changes.
