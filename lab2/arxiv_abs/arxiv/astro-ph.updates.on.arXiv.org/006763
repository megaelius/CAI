Hubble Space Telescope SNAPshot surveys of 86 X-ray selected galaxy clusters at $0.3 < z < 0.5$ from
the MACS sample have proven invaluable for the exploration of a wide range of astronomical research
topics. We here present an overview of the four MACS SNAPshot surveys conducted from Cycle 14 to Cycle
20 as part of a long-term effort aimed at identifying exceptional cluster targets for in-depth follow
up by the extragalactic community. We also release redshifts and X-ray luminosities of all clusters
observed as part of this initiative. To illustrate the power of SNAPshot observations of MACS clusters,
we explore several aspects of galaxy evolution illuminated by the images obtained for these programmes.
We confirm the high lensing efficiency of X-ray selected clusters at $z>0.3$. Examining the evolution
of the slope of the cluster red sequence, we observe at best a slight decrease with redshift, indicating
minimal age contribution since $z\sim 1$. Congruent to previous studies' findings, we note that
the two BCGs which are significantly bluer ($\geq 5\sigma$) than their clusters' red sequences
reside in relaxed clusters and exhibit pronounced internal structure. Thanks to our targets' high
X-ray luminosity, the subset of our sample observed with Chandra adds valuable leverage to the X-ray
luminosity--optical richness relation, which, albeit with substantial scatter, is now clearly
established from groups to extremely massive clusters of galaxies. We conclude that SNAPshot observations
of MACS clusters stand to continue to play a vital pathfinder role for astrophysical investigations
across the entire electromagnetic spectrum.
