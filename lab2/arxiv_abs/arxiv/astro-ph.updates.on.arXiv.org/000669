The Milky Way's million degree gaseous halo contains a considerable amount of mass that, depending
on its structural properties, can be a significant mass component. In order to analyze the structure
of the Galactic halo, we use XMM-Newton RGS archival data and measure OVII K alpha absorption-line
strengths towards 26 active galactic nuclei (AGN), LMC X-3, and two Galactic sources (4U 1820-30
and X1735-444). We assume a beta-model as the underlying gas density profile and find best-fit parameters
of n_o = 0.46^{+0.74}_{-0.35} cm^-3, r_c = 0.35^{+0.29}_{-0.27} kpc, and beta = 0.71^{+0.13}_{-0.14}.
These parameters result in halo masses ranging between M(18 kpc) = 7.5^{+22.0}_{-4.6} x 10^8 M_sun
and M(200 kpc) = 3.8^{+6.0}_{-0.5} x 10^{10} M_sun assuming a gas metallicity of Z = 0.3 Z_sun, which
are consistent with current theoretical and observational work. The maximum baryon fraction from
our halo model of f_b = 0.07^{+0.03}_{-0.01} is significantly smaller than the universal value
of f_b = 0.171, implying the mass contained in the Galactic halo accounts for 10 - 50% of the missing
baryons in the Milky Way. We also discuss our model in the context of several Milky Way observables,
including ram pressure stripping in dwarf spheroidal galaxies, the observed X-ray emission measure
in the 0.5 - 2 keV band, the Milky Way's star formation rate, spatial and thermal properties of cooler
gas (~10^5 K) and the observed Fermi bubbles towards the Galactic center. Although the metallicity
of the halo gas is a large uncertainty in our analysis, we place a lower limit on the halo gas between
the Sun and the LMC. We find that Z >~ 0.2 Z_sun based on the pulsar dispersion measure towards the
LMC.
