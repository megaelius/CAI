We present multi-wavelength studies of optically-defined merging clusters, based on the Hyper
Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. Luminous red galaxies, tracing cluster mass distributions,
enable to identify cluster subhalos at various merging stages, and thus make a homogeneous sample
of cluster mergers, which is unbiased with respect to the merger boost of the intracluster medium
(ICM). We define, using a peak-finding method, merging clusters with multiple-peaks and single
clusters with single-peaks from the CAMIRA cluster catalog. Stacked weak-lensing analysis indicates
that our sample of the merging clusters is categorized into major mergers. The average halo concentration
for the merging clusters is $\sim70\%$ smaller than that of the single-peak clusters, which agrees
well with predictions of numerical simulations. The spatial distribution of subhalos is less centrally
concentrated than the mass distribution of the main halo. The fractions of red galaxies in the merging
clusters are not higher than those of the single-peak clusters. We find a signature of the merger
boost of the ICM from stacked Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and ROSAT X-ray luminosity, but not
in optical richness. The stacked X-ray surface brightness distribution, aligned with the main-subhalo
pairs of low redshift and massive clusters, shows that the central gas core is elongated along the
merger axis and overall gas distribution is misaligned by $\sim60$ deg. The homogeneous, unbiased
sample of cluster mergers and multi-wavelength follow-up studies provide a unique opportunity
to make a complete picture of merger physics over the whole process.
