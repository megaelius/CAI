The problem of the re-entry predictions of GOCE has been deeply investigated in the literature,
due to the large amount of data, mainly radar and GPS, available until re-entry. The accurate GPS
and attitude measurements are used to compute a precise reference orbit for the three weeks of decay,
and to extrapolate the ballistic coefficient evolution of the object. In previous works, the capabilities
of radar-based solutions for the re-entry predictions of GOCE and of similar objects were investigated,
focusing on the german TIRA radar. In this work we have performed additional analysis, focusing
on the northern european radar EISCAT-UHF, located in Troms\o, Norway. This sensor, conceived
for atmospheric studies, has recently been considered for space debris applications. Due to its
limited tracking capabilities, we are interested in testing its effectiveness in supporting re-entry
predictions. We have simulated reliable re-entry prediction scenarios, with different availability
of data from EISCAT and TIRA. The main conclusion is that, provided a suitable amount of observations,
EISCAT-based re-entry predictions are comparable to TIRA-based, but also to GPS and TLE-based,
corresponding ones. In general, EISCAT is not able to determine an orbit with the same accuracy of
TIRA, but the results are equivalent in terms of re-entry predictions, if we consider the relevant
parameters involved and their effects on the re-entry time. What is very important is the difficulty
in predicting atmospheric and attitude significant variations in between the current epoch and
the actual re-entry. Thus, it is not easy to keep the accuracy of predictions much lower than 10% of
the residual lifetime, apart from cases with constant area to mass ratio, and low atmospheric variations
with respect to the models. An experiment with real data is presented for the object 2012-006K, with
consistent results.
