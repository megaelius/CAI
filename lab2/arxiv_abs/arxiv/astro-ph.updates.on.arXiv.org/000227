Detecting heavy atoms in the inflated atmospheres of giant exoplanets that orbit close to their
parent stars is a key factor for understanding their bulk composition, and the processes that drive
their expansion and interaction with the impinging stellar wind. Here, we use archive data obtained
with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope to report an absorption
of ~6.4+/-1.8% by neutral oxygen during the HD 189733b transit. Scaling published HI results from
a simple hydrodynamic model of HD 189733b, a vertical OI column density of ~8x10^15/cm2 produces
only a 3.5% attenuation, implying that non-thermal line broadening or super-solar abundances
are required. We also report evidence of short-time variability in the measured stellar flux, a
variability that we analyze and compare to solar flaring activity. In that frame, we find that non-statistical
uncertainties in the measured fluxes are not negligible, which calls for caution when reporting
transit absorptions. Despite these uncertainties, we also show a possible detection for both a
transit and early-ingress absorption in the ion CII 133.5nm lines. If confirmed, this would be the
second exoplanet for which an early-ingress absorption is reported. Assuming the HD 189733b magnetosphere
to be at the origin of the early absorption, we use the Parker model for the stellar wind and a particle-in-cell
code for the magnetosphere to show that its orientation should be deflected ~10-30{\deg} from the
planet-star line, while its nose's position should be at least ~16.7 Rp upstream of the exoplanet
in order to fit the CII transit light curve. The derived stand-off distance is consistent with a surface
magnetic field strength of ~5.3 Gauss for the exoplanet, and a supersonic stellar wind impinging
at ~250 km/s, with a temperature of 1.2x10^5K and a density ~6.3x10^6/cm^3 at the planetary orbit,
yet the fit is not unique.
