We present a new technique to determine distances to major star-forming regions across the Perseus
Molecular Cloud, using a combination of stellar photometry, astrometric data, and $\rm ^{12} CO$
spectral-line maps. Incorporating the Gaia DR2 parallax measurements when available, we start
by inferring the distance and reddening to stars from their Pan-STARRS1 and 2MASS photometry, based
on a technique presented in Green et al. 2014; Green et al. 2015 and implemented in their 3D "Bayestar"
dust map of three-quarters of the sky. We then refine the Green et al. technique by using the velocity
slices of a CO spectral cube as dust templates and modeling the cumulative distribution of dust along
the line of sight towards these stars as a linear combination of the emission in the slices. Using
a nested sampling algorithm, we fit these per-star distance-reddening measurements to find the
distances to the CO velocity slices towards each star-forming region. This results in distance
estimates explicitly tied to the velocity structure of the molecular gas. We determine distances
to the B5, IC348, B1, NGC1333, L1448, and L1451 star-forming regions and find that individual clouds
are located between $\approx 275-300$ pc, with typical combined uncertainties of $\approx 5\%$.
We find that the velocity gradient across Perseus corresponds to a distance gradient of about 25
pc, with the eastern portion of the cloud farther away than the western portion. We determine an average
distance to the complex of $294\pm 17$ pc, about 60 pc higher than the distance derived to the western
portion of the cloud using parallax measurements of water masers associated with young stellar
objects. The method we present is not limited to the Perseus Complex, but may be applied anywhere
on the sky with adequate CO data in the pursuit of more accurate 3D maps of molecular clouds in the solar
neighborhood and beyond.
