The ages and metallicities of globular clusters (GCs) are known to be powerful tracers of the properties
of their progenitor galaxies, enabling their use in determining the merger histories of galaxies.
However, while useful in separating GCs into individual accretion events, the orbits of GC groups
themselves have received less attention as probes of their progenitor galaxy properties. In this
work, we use simulations of galaxies and their GC systems from the E-MOSAICS project to explore how
the present-day orbital properties of GCs are related to the properties of their progenitor galaxies.
We find that the orbits of GCs deposited by accretion events are sensitive to the mass and merger redshift
of the satellite galaxy. Earlier mergers and larger galaxy masses deposit GCs at smaller median
apocentres and lower total orbital energy. The orbital properties of accreted groups of GCs can
therefore be used to infer the properties of their progenitor galaxy, though there exists a degeneracy
between galaxy mass and accretion time. Combining GC orbits with other tracers (GC ages, metallicities)
will help to break the galaxy mass/accretion time degeneracy, enabling stronger constraints on
the properties of their progenitor galaxy. In situ GCs generally orbit at lower energies (small
apocentres) than accreted GCs, however they exhibit a large tail to high energies and even retrograde
orbits (relative to the present-day disc), showing significant overlap with accreted GCs. Applying
the results to Milky Way GCs groups suggests a merger redshift $z \sim 1.5$ for the Gaia Sausage/Enceladus
and $z>2$ for the `low-energy'/Kraken group, adding further evidence that the Milky Way had two
significant mergers in its past.
