Tidal dissipation due to turbulent viscosity in the convective regions of giant stars plays an important
role in shaping the orbits of pre-common envelope systems. Such systems are possible sources of
transients and close compact binary systems that will eventually merge and produce detectable
gravitational wave signals. Most previous studies of the onset of common envelope episodes have
focused on circular orbits and synchronously rotating donor stars under the assumption that tidal
dissipation can quickly spin up the primary and circularize the orbit before the binary reaches
Roche-lobe overflow (RLO). We test this assumption by coupling numerical models of the post main
sequence stellar evolution of massive-stars with the model for tidal dissipation in convective
envelopes developed in Vick & Lai (2020) $-$ a tidal model that is accurate even for highly eccentric
orbits with small pericentre distances. We find that, in many cases, tidal dissipation does not
circularize the orbit before RLO. For a $10~M_\odot$ ($15~M_\odot$) primary star interacting
with a $1.4~M_\odot$ companion, systems with pericentre distances within 3 AU (6 AU) when the primary
leaves the main sequence will retain the initial orbital eccentricity when the primary grows to
the Roche radius. Even in systems that tidally circularize before RLO, the donor star may be rotating
subsynchronously at the onset of mass transfer. Our results demonstrate that some possible precursors
to double neutron star systems are likely eccentric at the Roche radius. The effects of pre-common
envelope eccentricity on the resulting compact binary merit further study.
