WASP-18b is an utra-hot Jupiter with a temperature difference of upto 2500K between day and night.
Such giant planets begin to emerge as planetary laboratory for understanding cloud formation and
gas chemistry in well-tested parameter regimes in order to better understand planetary mass loss
and for linking observed element ratios to planet formation and evolution. We aim to understand
where clouds form, their interaction with the gas phase chemistry through depletion and enrichment,
the ionisation of the atmospheric gas and the possible emergence of an ionosphere on ultra-hot Jupiters.
We utilize 1D profiles from a 3D atmosphere simulations for WASP-18b as input for kinetic cloud formation
and gas-phase chemical equilibrium calculations. We solve our kinetic cloud formation model for
these 1D profiles that sample the atmosphere of WASP-18b at 16 different locations along the equator
and in the mid-latitudes and derive consistently the gas-phase composition. The dayside of WASP-18b
emerges as completely cloud-free due to the very high atmospheric temperatures. In contrast, the
nightside is covered in geometrically extended and chemically heterogeneous clouds with disperse
particle size distributions. The atmospheric C/O increases to $>0.7$ and the enrichment of the
atmospheric gas with cloud particles is $\rho_{\rm d}/\rho_{\rm gas}>10^{-3}$. The clouds that
form at the limbs appear located farther inside the atmosphere and they are the least extended. Not
all day-night terminator regions form clouds. The gas-phase is dominated by H$_2$, CO, SiO, H$_2$O,
H$_2$S, CH$_4$, SiS. In addition, the dayside has a substantial degree of ionisation due to ions
like Na$^+$, K$^+$, Ca$^+$, Fe$^+$. Al$^+$ and Ti$^+$ are the most abundant of their element classes.
We find that WASP-18b, as one example for ultra-hot Jupiters, develops an ionosphere on the dayside.
