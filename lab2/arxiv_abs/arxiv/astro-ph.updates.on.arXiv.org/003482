Future searches for biomarkers on habitable exoplanets will rely on telescope instruments that
achieve extremely high contrast at small planet-to-star angular separations. Coronagraphy is
a promising starlight suppression technique, providing excellent contrast and throughput for
off-axis sources on clear apertures. However, the complexity of space- and ground-based telescope
apertures goes on increasing over time, owing to the combination of primary mirror segmentation,
secondary mirror, and support structures. These discontinuities in the telescope aperture limit
the coronagraph performance. In this paper, we present ACAD-OSM, a novel active method to correct
for the diffractive effects of aperture discontinuities in the final image plane of a coronagraph.
Active methods use one or several deformable mirrors that are controlled with an interaction matrix
to correct for the aberrations in the pupil. However, they are often limited by the amount of aberrations
introduced by aperture discontinuities. This algorithm relies on the recalibration of the interaction
matrix during the correction process to overcome this limitation. We first describe the ACAD-OSM
technique and compare it to the previous active methods for the correction of aperture discontinuities.
We then show its performance in terms of contrast and off-axis throughput for static aperture discontinuities
(segmentation, struts) and for some aberrations evolving over the life of the instrument (residual
phase aberrations, artifacts in the aperture, misalignments in the coronagraph design). This
technique can now obtain the earth-like planet detection threshold of 10^(-10) contrast on any
given aperture over at least a 10% spectral bandwidth, with several coronagraph designs.
