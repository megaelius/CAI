Thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) power spectrum is a powerful probe of the present-day amplitude
of matter density fluctuations, and has been measured up to $\ell\approx 10^3$ from the ${\it Planck}$
data. The largest systematic uncertainty in the interpretation of this data is the so-called "mass
bias" parameter $B$, which relates the true halo mass to the mass proxy used by the ${\it Planck}$
team as $M_{\rm 500c}^{Planck}=M_{\rm 500c}^{\rm true}/B$. Since the power spectrum of the cosmic
weak lensing shear is also sensitive to the amplitude of matter density fluctuations via $S_8\equiv
\sigma_8 \Omega_m^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha\sim 0.5$, we can break the degeneracy between the mass
bias and the cosmological parameters by combining the tSZ and cosmic shear power spectra. In this
paper, we perform a joint likelihood analysis of the tSZ power spectrum from ${\it Planck}$ and the
cosmic shear power spectrum from Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam. Our analysis does not use the primordial
cosmic microwave background (CMB) information. We obtain a new constraint on the mass bias as $B=1.37
\pm 0.20$, or $(1-b) = B^{-1} = 0.73 \pm 0.11$ (68% C.L.), for $\sigma_8 < 0.9$. This value of $B$ is
lower than that needed to reconcile the tSZ data with the primordial CMB and CMB lensing data, i.e.,
$B = 1.64 \pm 0.19$, but is consistent with the mass bias expected from hydrodynamical simulations,
$B = 1.28 \pm 0.20$. Our results thus indicate that the mass bias can be explained mostly by the non-thermal
pressure support from mass accretion of galaxy clusters via the cosmic structure formation, and
that the cosmologies inferred from the tSZ and the cosmic shear are consistent with each other.
