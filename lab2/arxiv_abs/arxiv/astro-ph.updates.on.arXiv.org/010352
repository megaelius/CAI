Nearby stars are prime targets for exoplanet searches and characterization using a variety of detection
techniques. Combining constraints from the complementary detection methods of high contrast
imaging (HCI) and radial velocity (RV) can further constrain the planetary architectures of these
systems because these methods place limits at different regions of the companion mass and semi-major
axis parameter space. We aim to constrain the planetary architectures from the combination of HCI
and RV data for 6 nearby stars within 6 pc: $\tau$ Ceti, Kapteyn's star, AX Mic, 40 Eri, HD 36395, and
HD 42581. We compiled the sample from stars with available archival VLT/NACO HCI data at L$^{\prime}$
band (3.8 $\mu$m). The NACO data were fully reanalyzed using the state-of-the-art direct imaging
pipeline PynPoint and combined with RV data from HARPS, Keck/HIRES, and CORALIE. A Monte Carlo approach
was used to assess the completeness in the companion mass/semi-major axis parameter space from
the combination of the HCI and RV data sets. We find that the HCI data add significant information
to the RV constraints, increasing the completeness for certain companions masses/semi-major
axes by up to 68 - 99% for 4 of the 6 stars in our sample, and by up to 1 - 13% for the remaining stars. The
improvements are strongest for intermediate semi-major axes (15 - 40 AU), corresponding to the
semi-major axes of the ice giants in our own solar system. The HCI mass limits reach 5 - 20 $M_{\textrm{Jup}}$
in the background-limited regime, depending on the age of the star. Through the combination of HCI
and RV data, we find that stringent constraints can be placed on the possible substellar companions
in these systems. Applying these methods systematically to nearby stars will quantify our current
knowledge of the planet population in the solar neighborhood and inform future observations.
