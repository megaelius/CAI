Canonical grids of stellar evolutionary sequences have been computed for the helium mass-fraction
abundances $Y = 0.25$, $0.29$, and $0.33$, and for iron abundances that vary from $-2.4$ to $+0.4$
(in 0.2 dex increments) when [$\alpha$/Fe] $= +0.4$, or for the ranges $-2.0 \le$ [Fe/H] $\le +0.6$,
$-1.8 \le$ [Fe/H] $\le +0.6$ when [$\alpha$/Fe] $= 0.0$ and $-0.4$, respectively. The grids, which
consist of tracks for masses from $0.12 {{\cal M}_\odot}$ to $1.1$-$1.5 {{\cal M}_\odot}$ (depending
on the metallicity) are based on up-to-date physics, including the gravitational settling of helium
(but not metals diffusion). Interpolation software is provided to generate isochrones for arbitrary
ages between $\approx 5$ and $15$ Gyr and any values of $Y$, [$\alpha$/Fe], and [Fe/H] within the
aforementioned ranges. Comparisons of isochrones with published color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs)
for the open clusters M67 ([Fe/H] $\approx 0.0$) and NGC 6791 ([Fe/H] $\approx 0.3$) and for four
of the metal-poor globular clusters (47 Tuc, M3, M5, and M92) indicate that the models for the observed
metallicities do a reasonably good job of reproducing the locations and slopes of the cluster main
sequences and giant branches. The same conclusion is reached from a consideration of plots of nearby
subdwarfs that have accurate Hipparcos parallaxes and metallicities in the range $-2.0 \le$ [Fe/H]
$\le -1.0$ on various CMDs and on the ($\log T_{\rm eff},\,M_V$)-diagram. A relatively hot temperature
scale similar to that derived in recent calibrations of the infrared flux method is favored by both
the isochrones and the adopted color transformations, which are based on the latest MARCS model
atmospheres.
