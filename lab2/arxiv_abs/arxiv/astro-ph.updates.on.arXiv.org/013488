Approximating a real manifold by an idealized one requires to calibrate the parameters characterizing
the idealized manifold in function of the real one. This calibration is a purely conventional process
and can generally be done in several ways, leading to different fittings. In practice, however,
all possible fittings cannot be considered as representative of the real manifold. Approximating
the real metric of the universe by the FLRW metric would be adequate only if both corresponding structures,
defined by the space-time interval, are equivalent on large scales. This requirement puts some
constraints on what would be a representative FLRW metric. We show that the way how measurements
on SNIa are interpreted to determine the evolution of the scale factor implicitly define the calibration
process, and that this one is compatible with the aforementioned constraints. On a theoretical
point of view, this indicates that the as fitted FLRW metric would indeed be representative of the
real one. On a practical point of view, however, we show that a bias in the measurements could invalidate
this conclusion. The bias comes from the fact that SNIa are not randomly distributed over space,
but are probably mostly located in regions were matter is largely present, i.e., in overdense regions.
We explain how this bias could account for the apparent accelerated expansion of the universe, without
needing to introduce the dark energy assumption. We show in particular that this bias leads to an
inadequate fitting of the FLRW metric, resulting in the appearance of a new term in the evolution
equation of the related scale factor, being equivalent to the cosmological constant.
