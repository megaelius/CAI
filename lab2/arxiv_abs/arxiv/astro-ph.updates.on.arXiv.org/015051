Reliable predictions of mass-loss rates are important for massive-star evolution computations.
We aim to provide predictions for mass-loss rates and wind-momentum rates of O-type stars, carefully
studying the behaviour of these winds as functions of stellar parameters like luminosity and metallicity.
We use newly developed steady-state models of radiation-driven winds to compute the global properties
of a grid of O-stars. The self-consistent models are calculated by means of an iterative solution
to the equation of motion using full NLTE radiative transfer in the co-moving frame to compute the
radiative acceleration. In order to study winds in different galactic environments, the grid covers
main-sequence stars, giants and supergiants in the Galaxy and both Magellanic Clouds. We find a
strong dependence of mass-loss on both luminosity and metallicity. Mean values across the grid
are $\dot{M}\sim L_{\ast}^{2.2}$ and $\dot{M}\sim Z_{\ast}^{0.95}$, however we also find a somewhat
stronger dependence on metallicity for lower luminosities. Similarly, the mass loss-luminosity
relation is somewhat steeper for the SMC than for the Galaxy. In addition, the computed rates are
systematically lower (by a factor 2 and more) than those commonly used in stellar-evolution calculations.
Overall, our results agree well with observations in the Galaxy that account properly for wind-clumping,
with empirical $\dot{M}$ vs. $Z_\ast$ scaling relations, and with observations of O-dwarfs in
the SMC. Our results provide simple fit relations for mass-loss rates and wind momenta of massive
O-stars stars as functions of luminosity and metallicity, valid in the range $T_{\rm eff} = 28000
- 45000$\,K. Due to the systematically lower $\dot{M}$, our new models suggest that new rates might
be needed in evolution simulations of massive stars.
