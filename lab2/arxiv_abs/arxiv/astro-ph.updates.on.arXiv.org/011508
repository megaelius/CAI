The emergence of magnetic flux into the solar atmosphere produces, among other phenomena, Ellerman
bombs (EBs), which are observed in H alpha and are due to magnetic reconnection in the photosphere
below the chromospheric canopy. Signs of reconnection are also observed in other spectral lines,
typical of the chromosphere or the transition region. An example are the UV bursts observed in the
transition region lines of Si IV and the upper chromospheric lines of Mg II. In this work we analyze
high cadence, high resolution coordinated observations between the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope
(SST) and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) spacecraft. H alpha images from the
SST provide us with the positions, timings and trajectories of EBs in an emerging flux region. Simultaneous,
co-aligned IRIS slit-jaw images at 133 (C II, transition region), 140 (Si IV, transition region)
and 279.6 (Mg II k, core, upper chromosphere) nm, as well as spectroscopy in the far and near ultraviolet
from the fast spectrograph raster, allow us to study the possible chromospheric/transition region
counterparts of those EBs. Our main goal is to study the possible temporal and spatial relationship
between several reconnection events at different layers in the atmosphere (namely EBs and UV bursts),
the timing history between them, and the connection of these dynamical phenomena to the ejection
of surges in the chromosphere. We also investigate the properties of an extended UV burst and their
variations across the burst domain. Our results suggest a scenario where simultaneous and co-spatial
EBs and UV bursts are part of the same reconnection system occurring sequentially along a vertical
or nearly vertical current sheet. Heating and bidirectional jets trace the location where reconnection
takes place. These results support and expand those obtained from recent numerical simulations
of magnetic flux emergence.
