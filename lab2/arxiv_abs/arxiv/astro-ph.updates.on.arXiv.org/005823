We report on the 22-23 June 2015 geomagnetic storm. There has been a shortage of intense geomagnetic
storms during the current solar cycle 24 in relation to the previous cycle. This situation changed
after mid-June 2015 when one of the biggest solar active regions (AR 2371) of current solar cycle
24, close to the central meridian produced several coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with
M-class flares. The CMEs impact on the Earth's magnetosphere resulted in a moderately-severe G4-class
geomagnetic storm on 22-23 June 2015 and a G2 (moderate) geomagnetic storms on 24 June. The G4 solstice
storm was the second biggest (so far) geomagnetic storms of cycle 24. We highlight the ground level
observations made by New-Tupi, Muonca and the CARPET El Leoncito cosmic ray detectors that are located
within the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region. These observations are studied in correlation
with data obtained by space-borne detectors and other ground-based experiments. The CME designations
are from the Computer Aided CME Tracking (CACTus) automated catalog. As expected, Forbush Decreases
(FD) associated with the passing CMEs were recorded by these detectors. We noticed a peculiar feature
linked to a severe geomagnetic storm event. The 21 June 2015 CME 0091 was likely associated with the
22 June summer solstice FD event. The angular width of CME 0091 was very narrow and measured 56 degrees
seen from Earth. In most cases, only CME halos and partial halos, lead to severe geomagnetic storms.
We performed a cross-check analysis of the FD events detected during the rise phase of the current
solar cycle 24, the geomagnetic parameters, and the CACTus CME catalog. Our study suggests that
narrow angular-width CMEs that erupt in the western region of the ecliptic plane can lead to moderate
and severe geomagnetic storms.
