Cloud-scale surveys of molecular gas reveal the link between molecular clouds properties and star
formation (SF) across a range of galactic environments. Cloud populations in galaxy disks are considered
to be representative of the `normal' SF. At high resolution, however, clouds with exceptional gas
properties and SF activity may also be observed in normal disk environments. In this paper, we study
the brightest cloud traced in CO emission in the disk of NGC628. The cloud is spatially coincident
with an extremely bright HII region. We characterize its molecular gas properties and investigate
how feedback and large-scale processes influence the properties of the molecular gas. High resolution
CO ALMA observations are used to characterize its mass and dynamical state, which are compared to
other clouds in NGC628. A LVG analysis is used to constrain the beam-diluted density and temperature
of the molecular gas. We analyze the MUSE spectrum using Starburst99 to characterize the young stellar
population associated with the HII region. The cloud is massive ($1-2\times10^7$M$_{\odot}$),
with a beam-diluted density of $n_{\rm H_2}=5\times10^4$ cm$^{-3}$. It has a low virial parameter,
suggesting that its CO emission may be overluminous due to heating by the HII region. A young ($2-4$
Myr), massive $3\times10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$ stellar population is associated. We argue that the
cloud is currently being destroyed by feedback from young massive stars. Due to the cloud's large
mass, this phase of the cloud's evolution is long enough for the impact of feedback on the excitation
of the gas to be observed. Its high mass may be related to its location at a spiral co-rotation radius,
where gas experiences reduced galactic shear compared to other regions of the disk, and receives
a sustained inflow of gas that can promote the cloud's mass growth.
