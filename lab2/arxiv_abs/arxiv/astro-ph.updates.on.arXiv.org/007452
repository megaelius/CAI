Exact solutions of the Dirac general relativistic equation that describe the dynamics of a massive,
electrically charged with half integer spin particle in the curved spacetime geometry of an electrically
charged, rotating Kerr-Newman-(anti) de Sitter black hole are investigated. We first, derive
the Dirac equation in the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter (KNdS) black hole background using a generalised
Kinnersley null tetrad in the Newman-Penrose formalism. Subsequently in this frame and in the KNdS
black hole spacetime, we prove the separation of the Dirac equation into ordinary differential
equations for the radial and angular parts. Under specific transformations of the independent
and dependent variables we prove that the transformed radial equation for a massive charged spin
$\frac{1}{2}$ fermion in the background KNdS black hole constitutes a highly non-trivial generalisation
of Heun's equation since it possess five regular finite singular points. Using a Regge-Wheeler-like
independent variable we transform the radial equation in the KNdS background into a Schr\"{o}dinger
like differential equation and investigate its asymptotic behaviour near the event and cosmological
horizons. For the case of a massive fermion in the background of a Kerr-Newman (KN) black hole we first
prove that the radial and angular equations that result from the separation of Dirac's equation
reduce to the generalised Heun differential equation (GHE). The local solutions of such GHE are
derived and can be described by holomorphic functions whose power series coefficients are determined
by a four-term recurrence relation. In addition using asymptotic analysis we derive the solutions
for the massive fermion far away from the KN black hole and the solutions near the event horizon . The
determination of the separation constant as an eigenvalue problem in the KN background is investigated.
