In regions of star formation, protostars and newborn stars accrete mass from their natal clouds.
These clouds are threaded by magnetic fields with a strength characterized by the plasma beta---the
ratio of thermal and magnetic pressures. Observations show molecular clouds have beta <= 1,
so magnetic fields can play a significant role in the accretion process. We have carried out a numerical
study of the effect of large-scale magnetic fields on the rate of accretion onto a uniformly moving
point particle from a uniform, non-self-gravitating, isothermal gas. We consider gas moving with
sonic Mach numbers of up M ~ 45, magnetic fields that are either parallel, perpendicular, or oriented
45 degrees to the flow, and beta as low as 0.01. Our simulations utilize AMR to obtain high spatial
resolution where needed; this also allows the simulation boundaries to be far from the accreting
object. Additionally, we show our results are independent of our exact prescription for accreting
mass in the sink particle. We give simple expressions for the steady-state accretion rate as a function
of beta, M, and field orientation. Using typical molecular clouds values of M ~ 5 and beta ~ 0.04 from
the literature, our fits suggest a 0.4 M_Sun star accretes ~ 4*10^{-9} M_Sun/year, almost a factor
of two less than accretion rates predicted by hydrodynamic models. This disparity grows to orders
of magnitude for stronger fields and lower Mach numbers. We discuss the applicability of these accretion
rates versus accretion rates expected from gravitational collapse, and when a steady state is possible.
This reduction in Mdot increases the time required to form stars in competitive accretion models,
making such models less efficient. In numerical codes, our results should enable accurate subgrid
models of sink particles accreting from magnetized media.
