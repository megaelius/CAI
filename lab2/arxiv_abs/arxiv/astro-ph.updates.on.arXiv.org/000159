Some reports of supernova (SN) discoveries turn out not to be true core-collapse explosions. One
such case was SN 2009ip, which was recognized to be a luminous blue variable (LBV) eruption. This
source had a massive hot progenitor star identified in pre-explosion data, it had documented evidence
of pre-outburst variability, and it was subsequently discovered to have a 2nd outburst in 2010.
This same source rebrightened again in 2012, and early spectra showed the same narrow-line profiles
as before, suggesting another LBV-like eruption. We present new photometry and spectroscopy of
SN 2009ip, indicating that it has transitioned into a true SN. The most striking discovery in these
data is that unlike previous reports, the spectrum exhibited Balmer lines with very broad P-Cygni
profiles characteristic of normal Type II supernovae (SNe II), in addition to narrow emission lines
seen in SNe IIn and LBVs. Emission components have FWHM 8000 km/s, while the P-Cygni absorption component
has blue wings extending to -13,000 km/s. These velocities are typical of SNe II, but have never been
associated with emission lines from a nonterminal LBV-like eruption. Initially, the peak absolute
magnitude seemed fainter than that of normal SNe. However, after a brief period of fading, the source
quickly brightened again to M_R=-17.5 mag over a couple days. The broad lines mostly disappeared,
and the spectrum began to resemble the early optically thick phases of SNe IIn. Two weeks later the
source leveled off near -18 mag, after which broad emission lines again developed in the spectrum
as the source faded. We conclude that the 2012 outburst of SN 2009ip was the result of a true core-collapse
SN IIn that occured when the progenitor star was in an LBV-like outburst phase, and where the SN was
initially faint and then rapidly brightened due to interaction with circumstellar material (abridged).
