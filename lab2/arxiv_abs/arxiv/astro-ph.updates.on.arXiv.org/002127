We study the surface brightness profiles of a sample of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) with 0.3<z<0.9.
The BCGs are selected from the first Red-sequence Cluster Survey and an X-ray cluster survey. The
surface brightness profiles of the BCGs are measured using HST ACS images, and most of them can be
well modeled by a Sersic profile with index ~ 6 and half-light radius ~ 30 kpc. Although the single
Sersic model fits the profiles well, we argue that the systematics in the sky background measurement
and the coupling between the model parameters make the comparison of the model parameters ambiguous.
Direct comparison of the BCG profiles, on the other hand, has revealed an inside-out growth for these
most massive galaxies: as the mass of a BCG increases, the central mass density of the galaxy increases
slowly ($\rho_{1kpc} \propto M*^{0.39}$), while the slope of the outer profile grows continuously
shallower ($\alpha \propto M*^{-2.5}$). Such a fashion of growth continues down to the less massive
early-type galaxies (ETGs), without apparent distinction between BCGs and non-BCGs. For the very
massive ETGs and BCGs, the slope of the Kormendy relation starts to trace the slope of the surface
brightness profiles and becomes insensitive to subtle profile evolution. These results are generally
consistent with dry mergers being the major driver of the mass growth for BCGs and massive ETGs. We
also find strong correlations between the richness of clusters and the properties of BCGs: the more
massive the clusters are, the more massive the BCGs ($M*_{bcg} \propto M_{clusters}^{0.6}$) and
the shallower their surface brightness profiles. After taking into account the bias in the cluster
samples, we find the masses of the BCGs have grown by at least a factor of 1.5 from z=0.5 to z=0, in contrast
to the previous findings of no evolution. Such an evolution validates the expectation from the LCDM
model.
