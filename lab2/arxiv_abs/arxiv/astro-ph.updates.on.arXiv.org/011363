We construct a supervised classifier based on Gaussian Mixture Models to probabilistically classify
objects in Gaia data release 2 (GDR2) using only photometric and astrometric data in that release.
The model is trained empirically to classify objects into three classes -- star, quasar, galaxy
-- for G<=14.5 mag down to the Gaia magnitude limit of G=21.0 mag. Galaxies and quasars are identified
for the training set by a cross-match to objects with spectroscopic classifications from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. Stars are defined directly from GDR2. When allowing for the expectation that
quasars are 500 times rarer than stars, and galaxies 7500 times rarer than stars (the class imbalance
problem), samples classified with a threshold probability of 0.5 are predicted to have purities
of 0.43 for quasars and 0.28 for galaxies, and completenesses of 0.58 and 0.72 respectively. The
purities can be increased up to 0.60 by adopting a higher threshold. Not accounting for this expected
low frequency of extragalactic objects (the class prior) would give both erroneously optimistic
performance predictions and severely impure samples. Applying our model to all 1.20 billion objects
in GDR2 with the required features, we classify 2.3 million objects as quasars and 0.37 million objects
as galaxies (with individual probabilities above 0.5). The small number of galaxies is due to the
strong bias of the satellite detection algorithm and on-ground data selection against extended
objects. We infer the true number of quasars and galaxies -- as these classes are defined by our training
set -- to be 690,000 and 110,000 respectively (+/- 50%). The aim of this work is to see how well extragalactic
objects can be classified using only GDR2 data. Better classifications should be possible with
the low resolution spectroscopy (BP/RP) planned for GDR3.
