ESA recently called for new "Science Ideas" to be investigated in terms of feasibility and technological
developments -- for technologies not yet sufficiently mature. These ideas may in the future become
candidates for M or L class missions within the ESA Science Program. With the launch of Gaia in December
2013, Europe entered a new era of space astrometry following in the footsteps of the very successful
Hipparcos mission from the early 1990s. Gaia is the successor to Hipparcos, both of which operated
in optical wavelengths, and Gaia is two orders of magnitude more accurate in the five astrometric
parameters and is surveying four orders of magnitude more stars in a vast volume of the Milky Way.
The combination of the Hipparcos/Tycho-2 catalogues with the first early Gaia data release will
give improved proper motions over a long ~25 year baseline. The final Gaia solution will also establish
a new optical reference frame by means of quasars, by linking the optical counterparts of radio (VLBI)
sources defining the orientation of the reference frame, and by using the zero proper motion of quasars
to determine a non-rotating frame. A weakness of Gaia is that it only operates at optical wavelengths.
However, much of the Galactic centre and the spiral arm regions, important for certain studies,
are obscured by interstellar extinction and this makes it difficult for Gaia to deeply probe. Traditionally,
this problem is overcome by switching to the infra-red but this was not possible with Gaia's CCDs.
Additionally, to scan the entire sky and make global absolute parallax measurements the spacecraft
must have a constant rotation and this requires that the CCDs operate in TDI mode, increasing their
complexity.
