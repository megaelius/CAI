The line emission in the coma was measured in the comets C/2001 Q4 (NEAT) and C/2002 T7 (LINEAR), that
were observed on five consecutive nights, 7-11 May 2004, at heliocentric distances of 1.0 and 0.7
AU, respectively, by means of high-resolution spectroscopy using the 10-m Submillimeter Telescope
(SMT). We present a search for six parent- and product-volatile species (HCN, H2CO, CO, CS, CH3OH,
and HNC) in both comets. Multiline observations of the CH3OH J = 5-4 series allow us to estimate the
rotational temperature using the rotation diagram technique. We derive rotational temperatures
of 54(9) K for C/2001 Q4 (NEAT) and 119(34) K for C/2002 T7 (LINEAR) that are roughly consistent with
observations of other comets at similar distances from the Sun. The gas production rates of material
are computed using a spherically symmetric molecular excitation code that includes collisions
between neutrals and electrons. We find an HCN production rate of 2.96(5)e26 molec.s-1 for comet
C/2001 Q4 (NEAT), corresponding to a mixing ratio with respect to H2O of 1.12(2)e-3. The mean HCN
production rate during the observing period is 4.54(10)e26 molec.s-1 for comet C/2002 T7 (LINEAR),
which gives a Q_HCN/Q_H2O mixing ratio of 1.51(3)e-3. With systematically lower mixing ratios
in comet C/2001 Q4 (NEAT), production rate ratios of the observed species with respect to H2O lie
within the typical ranges of dynamically new comets in both objects. We find a relative low abundance
of CO in C/2001 Q4 (NEAT) compared to the observed range in other comets based on millimeter/submillimeter
observations, and a significant upper limit on the CO production in C/2002 T7 (LINEAR) is derived.
Depletion of CO suggests partial evaporation from the surface layers during previous visits to
the outer Solar System and agrees with previous measurements of dynamically new comets.
