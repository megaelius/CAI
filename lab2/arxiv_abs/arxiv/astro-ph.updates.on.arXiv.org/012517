The hydrogen-rich envelopes accreted by white dwarf stars from their red dwarf companions lead
to thermonuclear runaways observed as classical nova eruptions peaking at up to 1 Million solar
luminosities. Virtually all nova progenitors are novalike binaries exhibiting high rates of mass
transfer to their white dwarfs before and after an eruption. It is a puzzle that binaries indistinguishable
from novalikes, but with much lower mass transfer rates, and resulting dwarf nova outbursts, co-exist
at the same orbital periods. Nova shells surrounding several dwarf novae demonstrate that at least
some novae become dwarf novae between successive nova eruptions, though the mechanisms and timescales
governing mass transfer rate variations are poorly understood. Here we report simulations of the
multiGyr evolution of novae which self-consistently model every eruption's thermonuclear runaway,
mass and angular momentum losses, feedback due to irradiation and variable mass transfer, and orbital
size and period changes. The simulations reproduce the observed wide range of mass transfer rates
at a given orbital period, with large and cyclic changes in white dwarf-red dwarf binaries emerging
on kyr to Myr timescales. They also demonstrate that deep hibernation, (complete stoppage of mass
transfer for long periods), occurs only in short-period binaries; that initially very different
binaries converge to become nearly identical systems; that while almost all prenovae should be
novalike binaries, dwarf novae should also occasionally be observed to give rise to novae; and that
the masses of white dwarfs decrease only slightly while their red dwarf companions are consumed.
