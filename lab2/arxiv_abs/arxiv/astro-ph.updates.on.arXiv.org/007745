The fast radio burst FRB 121102 has repeated multiple times, enabling the identification of its
host galaxy and of a spatially-coincident, compact, steady (`quiescent') radio synchrotron source.
It was proposed that FRB 121102 is powered by a young flaring magnetar, embedded within a decades-old
supernova remnant. Using a time-dependent one-zone model, we show that a single expanding magnetized
electron-ion nebula (powered by the same outbursts likely responsible for the FRBs) can explain
all the basic properties of the quiescent source (size, flux, self-absorption constraints) and
the large but decreasing rotation measure (RM) of the bursts. The quiescent emission is powered
by relativistic thermal electrons heated at the termination shock of the magnetar wind, while the
RM originates from non-relativistic electrons injected earlier in the nebula's evolution and
cooled through expansion and radiative losses. The model contains few free parameters, which are
tightly constrained by observations: the total energy injected into the nebula over its history,
$\sim 10^{50}-10^{51}$ erg, agrees with the magnetic energy of a millisecond magnetar; the baryon
loading of the magnetar outflow (driven by intermittent flares) is close to the neutron star escape
speed; the predicted source age $\sim 10-40$ years is consistent with other constraints on the nebula
size. For an energy input rate $\dot{E} \propto t^{-\alpha}$ following the onset of magnetar activity,
we predict secular decay of the RM and quiescent source flux, which approximately follow ${\rm RM}
\propto t^{-(6+\alpha)/2}$ and $F_{\nu} \propto t^{-(\alpha^2+7\alpha-2)/4}$, respectively.
