It remains unclear whether massive star evolution is facilitated by mass loss through stellar winds
only, or whether episodic mass loss during an eruptive luminous blue variable (LBV) phase is also
significant. LBVs exhibit unique photometric and spectroscopic variability (termed S Dor variables).
This may have tremendous implications for our understanding of the first stars, gravitational
wave events, and supernovae. A key question here is whether all evolved massive stars passing through
the blue supergiant phase are dormant S Dor variables transforming during a brief period, or whether
LBVs are truly unique objects. By investigating the OGLE light-curves of 64 B supergiants (Bsgs)
in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) on a timescale of three years with a cadence of one night, the incidence
of S Dor variables amongst the Bsgs population is investigated. From our sample, we find just one
Bsg, AzV 261, that displays the photometric behaviour characteristic of S Doradus variables. We
obtain and study a new VLT X-shooter spectrum of AzV 261 in order to investigate whether the object
has changed its effective temperature over the last decade. We do not find any effective temperature
variations indicating that the object is unlikely to be a LBV S Dor variable. As there is only one previous
bona-fide S Dor variable known to be present in the SMC (R 40), we find the maximum duration of the LBV
phase in the SMC to be at most $\sim$few 10$^3$yrs, or more likely that canonical Bsgs and S Dor LBVs
are intrinsically different objects. We discuss the implications for massive star evolution in
low metallicity environments, characteristic of the early Universe.
