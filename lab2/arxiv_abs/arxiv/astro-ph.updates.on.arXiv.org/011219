Gravitatonally lensed quasars are useful for studying astrophysics and cosmology, and enlarging
the sample size of lensed quasars is important for multiple studies. In this work, we develop a lens
search algorithm for four-image (quad) lensed quasars based on their time variability. In the development
of the lens search algorithm, we construct a pipeline simulating multi-epoch images of lensed quasars
in cadenced surveys, accounting for quasar variabilities, quasar hosts, lens galaxies, and the
PSF variation. Applying the simulation pipeline to the Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC) transient survey,
we generate HSC-like difference images of the mock lensed quasars from Oguri & Marshall's lens catalog.
We further develop a lens search algorithm that picks out variable objects as lensed quasar candidates
based on their spatial extent in the difference images. We test our lens search algorithm with the
mock lensed quasars and variable objects from the HSC transient survey. Using difference images
from multiple epochs, our lens search algorithm achieves a high true-positive rate (TPR) of 90.1%
and a low false-positive rate (FPR) of 2.3% for the bright quads with wide separation. With a preselection
on the number of blobs in the difference image, we obtain a TPR of 97.6% and a FPR of 2.6% for the bright
quads with wide separation. Even when difference images are only available in one single epoch,
our lens search algorithm could still detect the bright quads with wide separation at high TPR of
97.6% and low FPR of 2.4% in the optimal seeing scenario, and at TPR of $\sim94%$ and FPR of $\sim5%$
in typical scenarios. Therefore, our lens search algorithm is promising and could find new lensed
quasars in ongoing and upcoming cadenced surveys, such as the HSC transient survey and the Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope. [abridged]
