We investigate the signals from neutral He atoms observed from Earth orbit in 2010 by IBEX. The full
He signal observed during the 2010 observation season can be explained as a superposition of pristine
neutral interstellar He gas and an additional population of neutral He that we call the Warm Breeze.
The Warm Breeze is approximately two-fold slower and 2.5 times warmer than the primary interstellar
He population, and its density in front of the heliosphere is ~7% that of the neutral interstellar
helium. The inflow direction of the Warm Breeze differs by ~19deg from the inflow direction of interstellar
gas. The Warm Breeze seems a long-term feature of the heliospheric environment. It has not been detected
earlier because it is strongly ionized inside the heliosphere, which brings it below the threshold
of detection via pickup ion and heliospheric backscatter glow observations, as well as by the direct
sampling of GAS/Ulysses. Possible sources for the Warm Breeze include (1) the secondary population
of interstellar helium, created via charge exchange and perhaps elastic scattering of neutral
interstellar He atoms on interstellar He+ ions in the outer heliosheath, or (2) a gust of interstellar
He originating from a hypothetic wave train in the Local Interstellar Cloud. A secondary population
is expected from models, but the characteristics of the Warm Breeze do not fully conform to modeling
results. If, nevertheless, this is the explanation, IBEX-Lo observations of the Warm Breeze provide
key insights into the physical state of plasma in the outer heliosheath. If the second hypothesis
is true, the source is likely to be located within a few thousand of AU from the Sun, which is the propagation
range of possible gusts of interstellar neutral helium with the Warm Breeze characteristics against
dissipation via elastic scattering in the Local Cloud.
