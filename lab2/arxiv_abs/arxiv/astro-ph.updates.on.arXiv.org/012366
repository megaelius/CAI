Magnetic reconnection, topological change in magnetic fields, is a fundamental process in magnetized
plasmas. It is associated with energy release in regions of magnetic field annihilation, but this
is only one facet of this process. Astrophysical flows normally have very large Reynolds numbers
and are expected to be turbulent, in agreement with observations. In strong turbulence magnetic
lines constantly reconnect everywhere at all scales, making magnetic reconnection an intrinsic
part of turbulent cascade. We note that this is inconsistent with the usual practice of regarding
magnetic lines as persistent dynamical elements. A number of theoretical, numerical, and observational
studies, starting with Lazarian & Vishniac (1999), demonstrated that 3D turbulence makes magnetic
reconnection fast and that these two processes are intrinsically connected. We discuss the dramatic
violation of the textbook concept of magnetic flux-freezing in the presence of turbulence and demonstrate
that in the presence of turbulence the plasma effects are subdominant to turbulence as far as the
magnetic reconnection is concerned. This justifies an MHD-like treatment of magnetic reconnection
at scales much larger than the relevant plasma scales. We discuss numerical and observational evidences
supporting the turbulent reconnection model. In particular, we show that tearing reconnection
is suppressed in 3D and, unlike the 2D case, the 3D reconnection induces turbulence that makes reconnection
independent of resistivity. We show that turbulent reconnection dramatically affects the key
astrophysical processes, e.g., star formation, turbulent dynamo, acceleration of cosmic rays.
We provide criticism of the concept of "reconnection-mediated turbulence" and explain why turbulent
reconnection is very different from enhanced turbulent resistivity and hyper-resistivity, and
why the latter has fatal conceptual flaws.
