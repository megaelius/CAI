We examine how HI and metal absorption lines within low-redshift galaxy halos trace the dynamical
state of circumgalactic gas, using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include a well-vetted
heuristic model for galactic outflows. We categorize inflowing, outflowing, and ambient gas based
on its history and fate as tracked in our simulation. Following our earlier work showing that the
ionisation level of absorbers was a primary factor in determining the physical conditions of absorbing
gas, we show here that it is also a governing factor for its dynamical state. Low-ionisation metal
absorbers (e.g. MgII) tend to arise in gas that will fall onto galaxies within several Gyr, while
high-ionisation metal absorbers (e.g. OVI) generally trace material that was deposited by outflows
many Gyr ago. Inflowing gas is dominated by enriched material that was previously ejected in an outflow,
hence accretion at low redshifts is typically substantially enriched. Recycling wind material
is preferentially found closer to galaxies, and is more dominant in lower-mass halos since high-mass
halos have more hot gas that is able to support itself against infall. Low-mass halos also tend to
re-eject more of their accreted material, owing to our outflow prescription that employs higher
mass loading factors for lower-mass galaxies. Typical HI absorbers trace unenriched ambient material
that is not participating in the baryon cycle, but stronger HI absorbers arise in cool, enriched
inflowing gas. Instantaneous radial velocity measures of absorbers are generally poor at distinguishing
between inflowing and outflowing gas, except in the case of very recent outflows. These results
suggest that probing halo gas using a range of absorbers can provide detailed information about
the amount and physical conditions of material that is participating in the baryon cycle.
