We present a catalog of star clusters, associations and related extended objects in the Small Magellanic
Cloud and the Magellanic Bridge with 2741 entries, a factor 2 more than a previous version a decade
ago. It implements data from the literature up till December 2018. The analysis was carried out with
digital atlases in various bands currently available in Aladin. In particular, we cross-identified
recent cluster samples from the VMC, OGLE IV and SMASH surveys, confirming new clusters and pointing
out equivalencies. A major contribution of the present catalog are accurate central positions
for clusters and small associations, including a new sample of 47 clusters or candidates in the SMC
and 19 in the Bridge. We also analysed the recent SMC catalog by Bitsakis and collaborators who detected
objects with an overdensity search algorithm. They refer to them as clusters, but most have low stellar
density, are extended and diffuse, so that we classified them as associations. We conclude that
they found 1173 new objects, whereas 119 have equivalency in the literature. A general catalog must
also deal with the recent discoveries of 27 faint and ultra-faint star clusters and galaxies projected
on the far surroundings of the Clouds, mostly with DES. They have been complemented with photometric,
spectroscopic and kinematical follow-ups. The underluminous galaxies around the Magellanic
System, still too few compared to $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter simulations, can bring constraints
to galaxy formation and hierarchical evolution. On the other hand, we provide diagnostics, when
possible, for the nature of the ultra-faint clusters, searching for benchmarks and frontiers of
the Magellanic System extensions into the Milky Way potential.
