The second $Gaia$ Data Release (DR2) contains astrometric and photometric data for more than 1.6
billion objects with mean $Gaia$ $G$ magnitude $<$20.7, including many Young Stellar Objects (YSOs)
in different evolutionary stages. In order to explore the YSO population of the Milky Way, we combined
the $Gaia$ DR2 database with WISE and Planck measurements and made an all-sky probabilistic catalogue
of YSOs using machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, or
Neural Networks. Our input catalogue contains 103 million objects from the DR2xAllWISE cross-match
table. We classified each object into four main classes: YSOs, extragalactic objects, main-sequence
stars and evolved stars. At a 90% probability threshold we identified 1,129,295 YSO candidates.
To demonstrate the quality and potential of our YSO catalogue, here we present two applications
of it. (1) We explore the 3D structure of the Orion A star forming complex and show that the spatial
distribution of the YSOs classified by our procedure is in agreement with recent results from the
literature. (2) We use our catalogue to classify published $Gaia$ Science Alerts. As $Gaia$ measures
the sources at multiple epochs, it can efficiently discover transient events, including sudden
brightness changes of YSOs caused by dynamic processes of their circumstellar disk. However, in
many cases the physical nature of the published alert sources are not known. A cross-check with our
new catalogue shows that about 30% more of the published $Gaia$ alerts can most likely be attributed
to YSO activity. The catalogue can be also useful to identify YSOs among future $Gaia$ alerts.
