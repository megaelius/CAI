Context. PDS 70 is a young (5.4 Myr), nearby (~113 pc) star hosting a known transition disk with a large
gap. Recent observations with SPHERE and NACO in the near-infrared (NIR) allowed us to detect a planetary
mass companion, PDS70b, within the disk cavity. Moreover, observations in H_alpha with MagAO and
MUSE revealed emission associated to PDS70b and to another new companion candidate, PDS70c, at
a larger separation from the star. Aims. Our aim is to confirm the discovery of the second planet PDS70c
using SPHERE at VLT, to further characterize its physical properties, and search for additional
point sources in this young planetary system. Methods. We re-analyzed archival SPHERE NIR observations
and obtained new data in Y, J, H and K spectral bands for a total of four different epochs. The data were
reduced using the data reduction and handling pipeline and the SPHERE data center. We then applied
custom routines (e.g. ANDROMEDA and PACO) to subtract the starlight. Results. We re-detect both
PDS 70 b and c and confirm that PDS70c is gravitationally bound to the star. We estimate this second
planet to be less massive than 5 M Jup and with a T_eff around 900 K. Also, it has a low gravity with log
g between 3.0 and 3.5 dex. In addition, a third object has been identified at short separation (~0.12")
from the star and gravitationally bound to the star. Its spectrum is however very blue, so that we
are probably seeing stellar light reflected by dust and our analysis seems to demonstrate that it
is a feature of the inner disk. We, however, cannot completely exclude the possibility that it is
a planetary mass object enshrouded by a dust envelope. In this latter case, its mass should be of the
order of few tens of M_Earth. Moreover, we propose a possible structure for the planetary system
based on our data that, however, cannot be stable on a long timescale.
