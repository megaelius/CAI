The atmospheres and winds of C-type AGB stars are modeled with the 1D spherically symmetric radiation-hydrodynamical
code DARWIN. To explore the metallicity-dependence of mass loss we calculate model grids at three
different chemical abundances. Since carbon may be dredged up during the thermal pulses as AGB stars
evolve, we keep the carbon abundance as a free parameter. The models in these three different grids
all have a current mass of one solar mass; effective temperatures of 2600K, 2800K, 3000K, or 3200K;
and stellar luminosities equal to log(L/Lsun)=3.70, 3.85, or 4.00. The models show that mass loss
in carbon stars is facilitated by high luminosities, low effective temperatures, and a high carbon
excess (C-O) at both solar and subsolar metallicities. Similar combinations of effective temperature,
luminosity, and carbon excess produce outflows at both solar and subsolar metallicities. There
are no large systematic differences in the mass-loss rates and wind velocities produced by these
wind models with respect to metallicity, nor any systematic difference concerning the distribution
of grain sizes or how much carbon is condensed into dust. DARWIN models at subsolar metallicity have
approximately 15% lower mass-loss rates compared to DARWIN models at solar metallicity with the
same stellar parameters and carbon excess. For both solar and subsolar environments typical grain
sizes range between 0.1 and 0.5 micron, the degree of condensed carbon varies between 5% and 40%,
and the gas-to-dust ratios between 500 and 10000. Furthermore, stellar evolution models can use
the mass-loss rates calculated from DARWIN models at solar metallicity when modeling the AGB phase
at subsolar metallicities if carbon excess is used as the critical abundance parameter instead
of the C/O ratio.
