Photometry of the nebulae LDN1780, LDN1642 and LBN406 is used to derive scattering properties of
dust and to investigate the presence of UV fluorescence emission by molecular hydrogen and the extended
red emission (ERE). We used multi-wavelength optical photometry and imaging at ground-based telescopes
and archival imaging and spectroscopic UV data from the spaceborn GALEX and SPEAR/FIMS instruments.
We used Monte Carlo RT and both observational data and synthetic models for the ISRF in the solar neighbourhood.
The line-of-sight extinctions through the clouds have been determined using near infrared excesses
of background stars and the 200/250um far infrared emission by dust measured using the ISO and Herschel
space observatories. The optical surface brightness of the target clouds can be explained in terms
of scattered light. The dust albedo ranges from 0.58 at 3500A to 0.72 at 7500A. The SED of LDN1780 is
explained in terms of optical depth and background scattered light effects instead of ERE. The FUV
surface brightness of LDN 1780 cannot be explained by scattered light only. In LDN1780 H2 fluorescent
emission in the wavelength range 1400A-1700A has been detected and analysed. Our albedo values
agree with the predictions of the dust model of Weingartner and Draine and with the THEMIS CMM model
for evolved core-mantle grains. The H2 fluorescent emission in LDN1780 shows a pronounced dichotomy
with a preference for its southern side where enhanced illumination impinges from the Sco OB2 association
and the O star zeta Oph. A good correlation is found between the H2 fluorescence and a previously mapped
21-cm excess emission. The H2 fluorescence emission in LDN1780 has been modelled using a PDR code;
the resulting values for H2 column density and the total gas density are consistent with the estimates
derived from CO observations and optical extinction along the line of sight.
