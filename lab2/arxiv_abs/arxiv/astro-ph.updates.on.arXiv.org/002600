Cosmic bubbles are nucleated through the quantum tunneling process. After nucleation they would
expand and undergo collisions with each other. In this paper, we focus in particular on collisions
of two equal-sized bubbles and compute gravitational waves emitted from the collisions. First,
we study the mechanism of the collisions by means of a real scalar field and a quartic potential of
the field. Then, using this scalar field model, we compute gravitational waves from the collisions
in a straightforward manner. In the quadrupole approximation, time-domain gravitational waveforms
are directly obtained by integrating the energy-momentum tensors over the volume of the wave sources,
where the energy-momentum tensors are expressed in terms of the scalar field, the local geometry
and the potential; therefore, containing all information about the bubble collisions. We present
gravitational waveforms emitted during (i) the initial-to-intermediate stage of strong collisions
and (ii) the final stage of weak collisions: the former is obtained numerically, in full General
Relativity and the latter analytically, in the flat spacetime approximation. The thin-wall and
quadrupole approximations are assumed to simplify our computations and the next-to-leading order
corrections beyond these approximations are disregarded in our analysis. Nonetheless, we gain
qualitative insights into the time-domain gravitational waveforms from the bubble collisions:
during (i), the waveforms show the non-linearity of the collisions, characterized by a modulating
frequency and cusp-like bumps, whereas during (ii), the waveforms exhibit the linearity of the
collisions, featured by smooth monochromatic oscillations.
