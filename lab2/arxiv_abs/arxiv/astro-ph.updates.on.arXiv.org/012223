Measuring the diffuse Galactic gamma-ray flux in the TeV range is difficult for ground-based gamma-ray
telescopes because of the residual cosmic-ray background, which is higher than the gamma-ray flux
by several orders of magnitude. Its detection is also challenging for space-based telescopes because
of low signal statistics. We characterize the diffuse TeV flux from the Galaxy using decade-long
exposures of the Fermi Large Area Telescope. Considering that the level of diffuse Galactic emission
in the TeV band approaches the level of residual cosmic-ray background, we estimated the level of
residual cosmic-ray background in the SOURCEVETO event selection and verified that the TeV diffuse
Galactic emission flux is well above the residual cosmic-ray background up to high Galactic latitude
regions. We study spectral and imaging properties of the diffuse TeV signal from the Galactic plane.
We find much stronger emission from the inner Galactic plane than in previous HESS telescope estimates
(lower bound). We also find a significant difference in the measurement of the Galactic longitude
and latitude profiles of the signal measured by Fermi and HESS. These discrepancies are presumably
explained by the fact that regions of background estimate in HESS have non-negligible gamma-ray
flux. Comparing Fermi measurements with those of ARGO-YBJ, we find better agreement, with the notable
exception of the Cygnus region, where we find much higher flux (by a factor 1.5). We also measure the
TeV diffuse emission spectrum up to high Galactic latitude and show that the spectra of different
regions of the sky have spectral slopes consistent with Gamma=2.34+/- 0.04. We discuss the possible
origin of the hard slope of the TeV diffuse emission. Fermi/LAT provides reliable measurements
of the diffuse Galactic emission spectrum in the TeV range.
