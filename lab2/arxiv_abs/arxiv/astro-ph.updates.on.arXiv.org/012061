A candidate explanation for Early Mars rivers is atmospheric warming due to surface release of H$_2$
or CH$_4$ gas. However, it remains unknown how much gas could be released in a single event. We model
the CH$_4$ release by one mechanism for rapid release of CH$_4$ from clathrate. By modeling how CH$_4$-clathrate
release is affected by changes in Mars' obliquity and atmospheric composition, we find that a large
fraction of total outgassing from CH$_4$ clathrate occurs following Mars' first prolonged atmospheric
collapse. This atmosphere-collapse-initiated CH$_4$-release mechanism has three stages. (1)
Rapid collapse of Early Mars' carbon dioxide atmosphere initiates a slower shift of water ice from
high ground to the poles. (2) Upon subsequent CO$_2$-atmosphere re-inflation and CO$_2$-greenhouse
warming, low-latitude clathrate decomposes and releases methane gas. (3) Methane can then perturb
atmospheric chemistry and surface temperature, until photochemical processes destroy the methane.
Within our model, we find that under some circumstances a Titan-like haze layer would be expected
to form, consistent with transient deposition of abundant complex abiotic organic matter on the
Early Mars surface. We also find that this CH$_4$-release mechanism can warm Early Mars, but special
circumstances are required in order to uncork 10$^{17}$ kg of CH$_4$, the minimum needed for strong
warming. Specifically, strong warming only occurs when the fraction of the hydrate stability zone
that is initially occupied by clathrate exceeds 10%, and when Mars' first prolonged atmospheric
collapse occurs for atmospheric pressure > 1 bar.
