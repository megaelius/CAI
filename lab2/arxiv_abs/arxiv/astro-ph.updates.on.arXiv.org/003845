The forcing of interstellar turbulence, driven mainly by supernova explosions, is irrotational
in nature, but the development of significant amounts of vorticity and helicity, accompanied by
large-scale dynamo action, has been reported. Several earlier investigations examined vorticity
production in simpler systems; here all the relevant processes can be considered simultaneously.
We also investigate the mechanisms for the generation of net helicity and large-scale flow in the
system. We use a three-dimensional, stratified, rotating and shearing local simulation domain
of the size 1x1x2 kpc$^3$, forced with SN explosions occurring at the rate typical of the solar neighbourhood
in the Milky Way. In addition to the nominal simulation run with realistic Milky Way parameters,
we vary the rotation and shear rates, but keep the absolute value of their ratio fixed. Reversing
the sign of shear vs. rotation allows us to separate the rotation- and shear-generated contributions.
As in earlier studies, we find the generation of significant amounts of vorticity, with on average
65% of the kinetic energy being in the rotational modes. The vorticity production can be related
to the baroclinicity of the flow, especially in the regions of hot, dilute clustered supernova bubbles.
In these regions, the vortex stretching acts as a sink of vorticity. The net helicities produced
by rotation and shear are of opposite signs for physically motivated rotation laws, with the solar
neighbourhood parameters resulting in the near cancellation of the total net helicity. We also
find the excitation of oscillatory mean flows, the strength and oscillation period of which depend
on the Coriolis and shear parameters; we interpret these as signatures of the anisotropic kinetic
(AKA) effect. We use the method of moments to fit for the turbulent transport coeffcients, and find
$\alpha_{\rm AKA}$ values of the order 3-5 km/s.
