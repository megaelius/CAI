We report the detection of a Saturn-size exoplanet orbiting HD 332231 (TOI 1456) in light curves
from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite ($\textit{TESS}$). HD 332231, an F8 dwarf star
with a V-band magnitude of 8.56, was observed by $\textit{TESS}$ in Sector 14 and 15. We detect a single-transit
event in the Sector 15 presearch data conditioning (PDC) light curve. We obtain spectroscopic follow-up
observations of HD 332231 with the Automated Planet Finder (APF), Keck-I, and SONG telescopes.
The orbital period we infer from the radial velocity (RV) observations leads to the discovery of
another transit in Sector 14 that was masked by PDC due to scattered light contamination. A joint
analysis of the transit and RV data confirms the planetary nature of HD 332231 b, a Saturn-size ($0.867^{+0.027}_{-0.025}
\; R_{\rm J}$), sub-Saturn mass ($0.244\pm0.021 \; M_{\rm J}$) exoplanet on a 18.71-day circular
orbit. The low surface gravity of HD 332231 b along with the relatively low stellar flux it receives
makes it a compelling target for transmission spectroscopy. Also, the stellar obliquity is likely
measurable via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, an exciting prospect given the 0.14-au orbital
separation of HD 332231 b. The spectroscopic observations do not provide substantial evidence
for any additional planets in the HD 332231 system, but continued RV monitoring is needed to further
characterize this system. We also predict that the frequency and duration of masked data in the PDC
light curves for $\textit{TESS}$ Sectors 14-16 could hide transits of some exoplanets with orbital
periods between 10.5 and 17.5 days.
