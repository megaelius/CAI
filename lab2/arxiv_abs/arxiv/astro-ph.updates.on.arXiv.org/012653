Studying chromospheric activity of contact binaries is an important way of revealing the magnetic
activity processes of these systems. An efficient but somewhat neglected method for that is to follow
the changes of the H$\alpha$ line profiles via optical spectroscopy. Our goal was to perform a comprehensive
analysis based on the optical spectral signs of chromospheric activity on the largest sample of
contact binaries to date. We collected echelle spectra on 12 bright contact binaries and derived
new radial velocity curves from our observations. For quantifying the apparent chromospheric
activity levels of the systems, we subtracted self-constructed synthetic spectra from the observed
ones and measured the equivalent widths of the residual H$\alpha$-profiles at each observed epoch.
Our well-sampled data set allowed us to study the short-term variations of chromospheric activity
levels as well as to search for correlations between them and some basic physical parameters of the
systems. Fitting the radial velocity curves, we re-determined the mass ratios and systemic velocities
of all observed objects. We found that chromospheric activity levels of the studied systems show
various changes during the orbital revolution: we see either flat, or one-peaked, or two-peaked
distributions of equivalent width vs. the orbital phase. The first case means that the activity
level is probably constant, while the latter two cases suggest the presence of one or two active longitudes
at the stellar surfaces. Our correlation diagrams show that mean chromospheric activity levels
may be in connection with orbital periods, B$-$V color indices, inverse Rossby numbers, and temperature
differences of the components. At the same time, no clear trend is visible with respect to mass ratios,
inclinations and fill-out factors of the systems. A- and W-type contact binaries in our sample show
similar distributions.
