In this paper we derive an exact full expression for the 2D probability distribution of the ellipticity
of an object measured from data, only assuming Gaussian noise in pixel values. This is a generalisation
of the probability distribution for the ratio of single random variables, that is well-known, to
the multivariate case. This expression is derived within the context of the measurement of weak
gravitational lensing from noisy galaxy images. We find that the third flattening, or epsilon-ellipticity,
has a biased maximum likelihood but an unbiased mean; and that the third eccentricity, or normalised
polarisation chi, has both a biased maximum likelihood and a biased mean. The very fact that the bias
in the ellipticity is itself a function of the ellipticity requires an accurate knowledge of the
intrinsic ellipticity distribution of the galaxies in order to properly calibrate shear measurements.
We use this expression to explore strategies for calibration of biases caused by measurement processes
in weak gravitational lensing. We find that upcoming weak lensing surveys like KiDS or DES require
calibration fields of order of several degrees and 1.2 magnitudes deeper than the wide survey in
order to correct for the noise bias. Future surveys like Euclid will require calibration fields
of order 40 square degree and several magnitude deeper than the wide survey. We also investigate
the use of the Stokes parameters to estimate the shear as an alternative to the ellipticity. We find
that they can provide unbiased shear estimates at the cost of a very large variance in the measurement.
