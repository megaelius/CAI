Astrophotonics is the new frontier technology to develop diffraction-limited, miniaturized,
and cost-effective instruments for the next generation of large telescopes. For various astronomical
studies such as probing the early universe, observing in near infrared (NIR) is crucial. To address
this, we are developing moderate resolution (R = 1500) on-chip astrophotonic spectrographs in
the NIR bands (J Band: 1.1-1.4 $\mu m$; H band: 1.45-1.7 $\mu m$) using the concept of arrayed waveguide
gratings (AWGs). We fabricate the AWGs using a silica-on-silicon substrate. The waveguides on
these AWGs are 2 $\mu m$ wide and 0.1 $\mu m$ high Si3N4 core buried inside a 15 $\mu m$ thick SiO2 cladding.
To make the maximal use of astrophotonic integration such as coupling the AWGs with multiple single-mode
fibers coming from photonic lanterns or fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs), we require a multi-input AWG
design. In a multi-input AWG, the output spectrum due to each individual input channel overlaps
to produce a combined spectrum from all inputs. This on-chip combination of light effectively improves
the signal-to-noise ratio as compared to spreading the photons to several AWGs with single inputs.
In this paper, we present the design and simulation results of an AWG in the H band with 3 input waveguides
(channels). The resolving power of individual input channels is 1500, while the overall resolving
power with three inputs together is 500, 600, 750 in three different configurations simulated here.
The free spectral range of the device is 9.5 nm around a central wavelength of 1600 nm. For the standard
multi-input AWG, the relative shift between the output spectra due to adjacent input channels is
about 1.6 nm, which roughly equals one spectral channel spacing. In this paper, we discuss ways to
increase the resolving power and the number of inputs without compromising the free spectral range
or throughput.
