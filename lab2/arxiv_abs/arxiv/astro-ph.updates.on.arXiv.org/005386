The nearby open cluster NGC 752 presents a rare opportunity to study stellar properties at ages >1
Gyr. However, constructing a membership catalog for it is challenging; most surveys have been limited
to identifying its giants and dwarf members earlier than mid-K. We supplement past membership catalogs
with candidates selected with updated photometric and proper-motion criteria, generating a list
of 258 members, a >50% increase over previous catalogs. Using a Bayesian framework to fit MESA Isochrones
& Stellar Tracks evolutionary models to literature photometry and the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric
Solution data available for 59 cluster members, we infer the age of, and distance to, NGC 752: 1.34$\pm$0.06
Gyr and 438$_{-6}^{+8}$ pc. We also report the results of our optical monitoring of the cluster using
the Palomar Transient Factory. We obtain rotation periods for 12 K and M cluster members, the first
periods measured for such low-mass stars with a well-constrained age >1 Gyr. We compare these new
periods to data from the younger clusters Praesepe and NGC 6811, and to a theoretical model for angular-momentum
loss, to examine stellar spin down for low-mass stars over their first 1.3 Gyr. While on average NGC
752 stars are rotating more slowly than their younger counterparts, the difference is not significant.
Finally, we use our spectroscopic observations to measure Halpha for cluster stars, finding that
members earlier than $\approx$M2 are magnetically inactive, as expected at this age. Forthcoming
Gaia data should solidify and extend the membership of NGC 752 to lower masses, thereby increasing
its importance for studies of low-mass stars.
