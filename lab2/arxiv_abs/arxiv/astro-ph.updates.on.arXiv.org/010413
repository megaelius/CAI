A precise interstellar dust extinction law is critically important to interpret observations.
There are two indicators of extinction: the color excess ratio (CER) and the relative extinction.
Compared to the CER, the wavelength-dependent relative extinction is more challenging to be determined.
In this work, we combine spectroscopic, astrometric, and photometric data to derive high-precision
CERs and relative extinction from optical to mid-infrared (IR) bands. A group of 61,111 red clump
(RC) stars are selected as tracers by stellar parameters from APOGEE survey. The multiband photometric
data are collected from Gaia, APASS, SDSS, Pan-STARRS1, 2MASS, and WISE surveys. For the first time,
we calibrate the curvature of CERs in determining CERs E(lambda-GRP)/E(GBP-GRP) from color excess--color
excess diagrams. Through elaborate uncertainty analysis, we conclude that the precision of our
CERs is significantly improved (sigma < 0.015). With parallaxes from Gaia DR2, we calculate the
relative extinction A_GBP/A_GRP for 5051 RC stars. By combining the CERs with the A_GBP/A_GRP,
the optical--mid-IR extinction A_lambda/A_GRP has been determined in a total of 21 bands. Given
no bias toward any specific environment, our extinction law represents the average extinction
law with the total-to-selective extinction ratio Rv=3.16+-0.15. Our observed extinction law
supports an adjustment in parameters of the CCM Rv=3.1 curve, together with the near-IR power-law
index alpha=2.07+-0.03. The relative extinction values of HST and JWST near-IR bandpasses are
predicted in 2.5% precision. As the observed reddening/extinction tracks are curved, the curvature
correction needs to be considered when applying extinction correction.
