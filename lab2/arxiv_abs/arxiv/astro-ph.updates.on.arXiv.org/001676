We use cosmology-independent measurements of the expansion history in the redshift range 0.1 <
z <1.2 and compare them with the Cosmic Microwave Background-derived expansion history predictions.
The motivation is to investigate if the tension between the local (cosmology independent) Hubble
constant H0 value and the Planck-derived H0 is also present at other redshifts. We conclude that
there is no tension between Planck and cosmology independent-measurements of the Hubble parameter
H(z) at 0.1 < z < 1.2 for the LCDM model (odds of tension are only 1:15, statistically not significant).
Considering extensions of the LCDM model does not improve these odds (actually makes them worse),
thus favouring the simpler model over its extensions. On the other hand the H(z) data are also not
in tension with the local H0 measurements but the combination of all three data-sets shows a highly
significant tension (odds ~ 1:400). Thus the new data deepen the mystery of the mismatch between
Planck and local H0 measurements, and cannot univocally determine wether it is an effect localised
at a particular redshift. Having said this, we find that assuming the NGC4258 maser distance as the
correct anchor for H0, brings the odds to comfortable values. Further, using only the expansion
history measurements we constrain, within the LCDM model, H0 = 68.5 +- 3.5 and Omega_m = 0.32 +- 0.05
without relying on any CMB prior. We also address the question of how smooth the expansion history
of the universe is given the cosmology independent data and conclude that there is no evidence for
deviations from smoothness on the expansion history, neither variations with time in the value
of the equation of state of dark energy.
