This article analyzes the data for the five gravitational wave (GW) events detected in Hanford(H1),
Livingston(L1) and Virgo(V1) detectors by the LIGO collaboration. It is shown that GW170814, GW170817,
GW151226 and GW170104 are very weak signals whose amplitude does not rise significantly during
the GW event, and they are indistinguishable from non-stationary detector noise. LIGO software
implements cross-correlation funcion(CCF) of H1/L1 signals with the template reference signal,
in frequency domain, in a matched filter, using 32 second windows. It is shown that this matched filter
misfires with high SNR/CCF peaks, even for very low-amplitude, short bursts of sine wave signals
and additive white gaussian noise(AWGN), all the time. It is shown that this erratic behaviour of
the matched filter, is due to the error in signal processing operations, such as lack of cyclic prefix
necessary to account for circular convolution. It is also shown that normalized CCF method implemented
in time domain using short windows, does not have false CCF peaks for sine wave and noise bursts. It
is shown that the normalized CCF for GW151226 and GW170104, when correlating H1/L1 and template,
is indistinguishable from correlating detector noise and the template. It is also shown that the
normalized CCF for GW151226 and GW170104, when correlating H1/L1 and template, is indistinguishable
from correlating H1/L1 and bogus chirp templates which are frequency modulated(FM) waveforms
which differ significantly from ideal templates. Similar results are shown with LIGO matched filter,
which misfires with high Signal to Noise Ratio(SNR) for bogus chirp templates.
