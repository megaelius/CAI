Understanding the escape of Lyman continuum (LyC) and Lyman alpha (Lya) photons from molecular
clouds is one of the keys to constraining the reionization history of the Universe and the evolution
of galaxies at high redshift. Using a set of radiation-hydrodynamic simulations with adaptive
mesh refinement, we investigate how photons propagate and escape from turbulent clouds with different
masses, star formation efficiencies (SFEs), and metallicities, as well as with different models
of stellar spectra and supernova feedback. We find that the escape fractions in both LyC and Lya are
generally increasing with time if the cloud is efficiently dispersed by radiation and supernova
feedback. When the total SFE is low (1% of the cloud mass), 0.1-5% of LyC photons leave the metal-poor
cloud, whereas the fractions increase to 20-70% in clouds with a 10% SFE. LyC photons escape more
efficiently if gas metallicity is lower, if the upper mass limit in the stellar initial mass function
is higher, if binary interactions are allowed in the evolution of stars, or if additional strong
radiation pressure, such as Lya pressure, is present. As a result, the number of escaping LyC photons
can easily vary by a factor of $\sim4$ on cloud scales. The escape fractions of Lya photons are systemically
higher (60-80%) than those of LyC photons despite large optical depths at line centre ($\tau_0\sim10^6-10^9$).
Scattering of Lya photons is already significant on cloud scales, leading to double-peaked profiles
with peak separations of $v_{\rm sep}\sim400\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ during the initial stage of the
cloud evolution, while it becomes narrower than $v_{\rm sep} \le 150 \, {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ in the
LyC bright phase. Comparisons with observations of low-redshift galaxies suggest that Lya photons
require further interactions with neutral hydrogen to reproduce their velocity offset for a given
LyC escape fraction.
