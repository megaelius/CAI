We present the Cosmic Lyman-$\alpha$ Transfer code (COLT), a new massively parallel Monte-Carlo
radiative transfer code, to simulate Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) resonant scattering through
neutral hydrogen as a probe of the first galaxies. We explore the interaction of centrally produced
Ly$\alpha$ radiation with the host galactic environment. The Ly$\alpha$ photons emitted from
the luminous starburst region escape with characteristic features in the line profile depending
on the density distribution, ionization structure, and bulk velocity fields. For example, the
presence of anisotropic ionization exhibits a tall peak close to line centre with a skewed tail that
drops off gradually. Furthermore, moderate (~10 km/s) outflow produces an amplified peak redward
of line centre. Idealized models of first galaxies explore the effect of mass, anisotropic H II regions,
and radiation pressure driven winds on Ly$\alpha$ observables. We employ mesh refinement to resolve
critical structures. We also post-process an ab initio cosmological simulation and examine images
captured at various escape distances within the 1 Mpc$^3$ comoving volume. Finally, we discuss
the emergent spectra and surface brightness profiles of these objects in the context of high-$z$
observations. The first galaxies will likely be observed through the red damping wing of the Ly$\alpha$
line. Observations will be biased toward galaxies with an intrinsic red peak located far from line
centre that reside in extensive H II super bubbles, which allows Hubble flow to sufficiently redshift
photons away from line centre and thereby facilitate transmission through the intergalactic medium
(IGM). Even with gravitational lensing to boost the luminosity we predict that Ly$\alpha$ emission
from stellar clusters within haloes of $M_{\rm vir}<10^9~{\rm M}_\odot$ is generally too faint
to be detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).
