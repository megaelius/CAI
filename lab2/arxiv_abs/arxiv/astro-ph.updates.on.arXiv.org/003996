We present a coupled 3-D atmospheric dynamics and radiative transfer model to predict the disk-integrated
thermal emission spectra of transiting exoplanets in edge-on orbits. We calculate spectra at high
resolution to examine the extent to which high-resolution emission spectra are influenced by 3-D
atmospheric dynamics and planetary rotation, and to determine whether and how we can constrain
thermal structures and atmospheric dynamics through high-resolution spectroscopy. This study
represents the first time that the line-of-sight geometry and resulting Doppler shifts from winds
and rotation have been treated self-consistently in an emission spectrum radiative transfer model,
which allow us to assess the impact of the velocity field on thermal emission spectra. We apply our
model to predict emission spectra as a function of orbital phase for three hot Jupiters, HD 209458b,
WASP-43b and HD 189733b. We find net Doppler shifts in modeled spectra due to a combination of winds
and rotation at a level of 1-3 km/s. These Doppler signatures vary in a quasi-sinusoidal pattern
over the course of the planets' orbits as the hot spots approach and recede from the observer's viewpoint.
We predict that WASP-43b produces the largest Doppler shift due to its fast rotation rate. We find
that the net Doppler shift in an exoplanet's disk-integrated thermal emission spectrum results
from a complex combination of winds, rotation, and thermal structure. However, we offer a simple
method that estimates the magnitude of equatorial wind speeds in hot Jupiters through measurements
of net Doppler shifts and lower resolution thermal phase curves.
