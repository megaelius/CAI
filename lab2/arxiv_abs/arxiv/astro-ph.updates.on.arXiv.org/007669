We present the UNIT $N$-body cosmological simulations project, which is designed to provide precise
predictions for nonlinear statistics of the galaxy distribution appropriate for characterizing
emission line and luminous red galaxies in the current and upcoming generation of galaxy surveys.
We investigate the recently suggested technique of Angulo & Pontzen 2016 designed to suppress the
variance of cosmological simulations with a suite of precise particle mesh simulations (FastPM)
as well as with full $N$-body calculations with a mass resolution of $\sim 1.2\times10^9\,h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$.
We study redshift space distortions, cosmic voids, higher order statistics from $z=2$ down to $z=0$.
We find that both two- and three-point statistics are unbiased, and that over the scales of interest
for baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift-space distortions, the variance is greatly reduced
in the two-point statistics and in the cross-correlation between halos and cosmic voids, but is
not reduced significantly for the three-point statistics. We demonstrate that the accuracy of
the two-point correlation function for a galaxy survey having an effective volume of 20 ($h^{-1}$Gpc)$^3$
is improved by about a factor of 40, meaning that two pairs of simulations with a volume of 1 ($h^{-1}$Gpc)$^3$
lead to the equivalent variance of $\sim$150 such simulations. The $N$-body simulations presented
here thus provide an effective survey volume of about seven times the effective survey volume of
DESI or Euclid. The data from this project, including dark matter fields, halo catalogues, and their
clustering statistics, are publicly available at this http URL
