After correcting for their light-curve shape and color, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are precise
cosmological distance indicators. However, there remains a non-zero intrinsic scatter in the
differences between measured distance and that inferred from a cosmological model (i.e., Hubble
residuals or HRs), indicating that SN Ia distances can potentially be further improved. We use the
open-source relational database kaepora to generate composite spectra with desired average properties
of phase, light-curve shape, and HR. At many phases, the composite spectra from two subsamples with
positive and negative average HRs are significantly different. In particular, in all spectra from
9 days before to 15 days after peak brightness, we find that SNe with negative HRs have, on average,
higher ejecta velocities (as seen in nearly every optical spectral feature) than SNe with positive
HRs. At +4 days relative to B-band maximum, using a sample of 62 SNe Ia, we measure a 0.091 +/- 0.035
mag HR step between SNe with Si II 6355 line velocities higher/lower than -11,000 km/s (the median
velocity). After light-curve shape and color correction, SNe with higher velocities tend to have
underestimated distance moduli relative to a cosmological model. The intrinsic scatter in our
sample reduces from 0.094 mag to 0.082 mag after making this correction. Using the Si II 6355 velocity
evolution of 115 SNe Ia, we estimate that a velocity difference > 500 km/s exists at each epoch between
the positive-HR and negative-HR samples with 99.4% confidence. Finally at epochs later than +37
days, we observe that negative-HR composite spectra tend to have weaker spectral features in comparison
to positive-HR composite spectra.
