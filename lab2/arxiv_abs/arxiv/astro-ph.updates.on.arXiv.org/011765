We live in the era where observational probes like Event Horizon Telescope and GRAVITY have achieved
unprecedented resolutions with technique of interferometry combining data taken with multiple
telescopes. This enables us to observe and image the supermassive black holes located at the center
of our and neighboring galaxies and understand its astrophysical environment and various physical
processes occurring in their vicinity. In this work we focus on the situation where significant
amount of matter could be located close to the event horizon of the central black hole and how it affects
the gravitational lensing signal. We consider a simple toy model where matter is concentrated in
the rather small region between the inner photon sphere associated with the mass of central black
hole and outer photon sphere associated with the total mass outside. If no photon sphere is present
inside the matter distribution, then effective potential displays an interesting trend with maxima
at inner and outer photon sphere, with peak at inner photon sphere higher than that at outer photon
sphere. In such a case we get three distinct set of infinitely many relativistic images and Einstein
rings. This kind of pattern of images is quite unprecedented and would serve as a smoking gun gravitational
lensing signature signaling the presence of matter lump in the surrounding of black hole. We further
argue that if the mass of the black hole inferred from the observation of size of its shadow is less
that the mass inferred from the motion of objects around it, it signals the presence of matter in the
vicinity of black hole.
