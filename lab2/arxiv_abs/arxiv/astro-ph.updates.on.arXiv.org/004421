It has long been recognized that the finite speed of light can affect the observed time of an event.
For example, as a source moves radially toward or away from an observer, the path length and therefore
the light travel time to the observer decreases or increases, causing the event to appear earlier
or later than otherwise expected, respectively. This light travel time effect (LTTE) has been applied
to transits and eclipses for a variety of purposes, including studies of eclipse timing variations
(ETVs) and transit timing variations (TTVs) that reveal the presence of additional bodies in the
system. Here we highlight another non-relativistic effect on eclipse or transit times arising
from the finite speed of light---caused by an asymmetry in the transverse velocity of the two eclipsing
objects, relative to the observer. This asymmetry can be due to a non-unity mass ratio or to the presence
of external barycentric motion. Although usually constant, this barycentric and asymmetric transverse
velocities (BATV) effect can vary between sequential eclipses if either the path length between
the two objects or the barycentric transverse velocity varies in time. We discuss this BATV effect
and estimate its magnitude for both time-dependent and time-independent cases. For the time-dependent
cases, we consider binaries that experience a change in orbital inclination, eccentric systems
with and without apsidal motion, and hierarchical triple systems. We also consider the time-independent
case which, by affecting the primary and secondary eclipses differently, can influence the inferred
system parameters, such as the orbital eccentricity.
