The spatial variations of stellar population properties within a galaxy are intimately related
to their formation process. Therefore, spatially resolved studies of galaxies are essential to
uncover their formation and assembly. The Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS)
is a dedicated multi-filter designed to observed ~8500 deg2 using twelve narrow-, intermediate-
and broad-band filters in the optical range. In this study, we test the potential of the multi-filter
observation carried out with J-PLUS to investigate the properties of spatially-resolved nearby
galaxies. We present detailed 2D maps of stellar population properties (age, metallicity, extinction,
and stellar mass surface density) for two early-type galaxies observed in both, J-PLUS and CALIFA
surveys: NGC 5473 and NGC 5485. Radial structures are also compared and luminosity- and mass-weighted
profiles are derived. We use MUFFIT to process the J-PLUS observations, and two different techniques
(STARLIGHT and STECKMAP) to analyze IFU CALIFA data. We demonstrate that this novel technique delivers
radial stellar population gradients in good agreement with the IFU technique CALIFA/STECKMAP
although comparison of the absolute values reveals the existence of intrinsic systematic differences.
Radial stellar population gradients differ when CALIFA/STARLIGHT methodology is used. Age and
metallicity radial profiles derived from J-PLUS/MUFFIT are very similar when luminosity- or mass-weighted
properties are used, suggesting that the contribution of a younger component is small. Comparison
between the three methodologies reveals some discrepancies suggesting that the specific characteristics
of each method causes important differences. We conclude that the ages, metallicities and extinction
derived for individual galaxies not only depend on the chosen models but also depend on the method
used.
