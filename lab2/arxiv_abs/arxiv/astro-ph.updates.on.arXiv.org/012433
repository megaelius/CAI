In our local Galactic neighborhood, molecular clouds are best studied using a combination of dust
measurements, to determine robust masses, sizes and internal structures of the clouds, and molecular-line
observations to determine cloud kinematics and chemistry. We present here the first results of
a program designed to extend such studies to nearby galaxies beyond the Magellanic Clouds. Utilizing
the wideband upgrade of the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at 230 GHz we have obtained the first continuum
detections of the thermal dust emission on sub-GMC scales ($\sim$ 15 pc) within the Andromeda galaxy
(M31). These include the first resolved continuum detections of dust emission from individual
GMCs beyond the Magellanic Clouds. Utilizing a powerful capability of the SMA, we simultaneously
recorded CO(2-1) emission with identical $(u,\,v)$ coverage, astrometry and calibration, enabling
the first measurements of the CO conversion factor, $\alpha_{\rm\,CO(2-1)}$, toward individual
GMCs across an external galaxy. Our direct measurement yields an average CO--to--dust mass conversion
factor of $\alpha^\prime_{\rm CO-dust} = 0.042\pm0.018$ $M_\odot$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$)$^{-1}$
for the $J= 2-1$ transition. This value does not appear to vary with galactocentric radius. Assuming
a constant gas-to-dust ratio of 136, the resulting $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ $=$ 5.7 $\pm$ 2.4 $M_\odot$
(K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$)$^{-1}$ for the 2-1 transition is in excellent agreement with that of Milky
Way GMCs, given the uncertainties. Finally, using the same analysis techniques, we compare our
results with observations of the local Orion molecular clouds, placed at the distance of M31 and
simulated to appear as they would if observed by the SMA.
