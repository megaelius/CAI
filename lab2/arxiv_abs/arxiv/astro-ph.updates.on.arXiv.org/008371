Ratios of different ions of the same element encode ionization information independently from
relative abundances in quasar absorption line systems, crucial for understanding the multiphase
nature and origin of absorbing gas, particularly at $z>6$ where H I cannot be observed. Observational
considerations have limited such studies to a small number of sightlines, with most surveys at $z>6$
focused upon the statistical properties of individual ions such as Mg II or C IV. Here we compare high-
and low-ionization absorption within 69 intervening systems at $z>5$, including 16 systems at
$z>6$, from Magellan/FIRE spectra of 47 quasars together with a Keck/HIRES spectrum of the `ultraluminous'
$z=6.3$ quasar SDSSJ010013.02+280225.8. The highest redshift absorbers increasingly exhibit
low-ionization species alone, consistent with previous single-ion surveys that show the frequency
of Mg II is unchanging with redshift while C IV absorption drops markedly toward $z=6$. We detect
no C IV or Si IV in half of all metal-line absorbers at $z>5.7$, with stacks not revealing any slightly
weaker C IV just below our detection threshold, and most of the other half have $N_\mathrm{CII}>N_\mathrm{CIV}$.
In contrast, only 20\% of absorbers at 5.0--5.7 lack high-ionization gas, and a search of 25 HIRES
sightlines at $z\sim3$ yielded zero such examples. We infer these low-ionization high-redshift
absorption systems may be analogous to metal-poor Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ systems ($\sim1\%$ of
the absorber population at $z\sim3$), based on incidence rates and absolute and relative column
densities. Simple photoionization models suggest that circumgalactic matter at redshift six
has systematically lower chemical abundances and experiences a softer ionizing background relative
to redshift three.
