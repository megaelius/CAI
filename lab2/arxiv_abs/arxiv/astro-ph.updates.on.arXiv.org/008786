Using ALMA, we report high angular-resolution observations of the redshift z=3.63 galaxy, G09v1.97,
one of the most luminous strongly lensed galaxies discovered by the H-ATLAS survey. We present 0"2-0"4
resolution images of the rest-frame 188 and 419$\mu$m dust continuum and the CO(6-5), H2O(211-202)
and J=2 H2O+ line emission. We also report the detection of H$_2^{18}$O in this source. The dust continuum
and molecular gas emission are resolved into a nearly complete ~1"5 diameter Einstein ring plus
a weaker image in the center, which is caused by a special dual deflector lensing configuration.
The observed line profiles of the CO, H2O and H2O+ lines are strikingly similar. In the source plane,
we reconstruct the dust continuum images and the spectral cubes of the line emission at sub-kpc scales.
The reconstructed dust emission in the source plane is dominated by a compact disk with an effective
radius of 0.7kpc plus an overlapping extended disk with a radius twice as large. While the average
magnification for the dust continuum is $\mu$~10-11, the magnification of the line emission varies
5 to 22 across different velocity components. The emission lines have similar spatial and kinematic
distributions. The molecular gas and dust content reveal that G09v1.97 is a gas-rich major merger
in its pre-coalescence phase. Both of the merging companions are intrinsically ULIRGs with LIR
reaching $\gtrsim 4\times10^{12}L_\odot$, and the total LIR of G09v1.97 is $1.4\times10^{13}L_\odot$.
The approaching southern galaxy shows no obvious kinematic structure with a semi-major half-light
radius a_s=0.4kpc, while the receding galaxy resembles an a_s=1.2kpc rotating disk. The two galaxies
are separated by a projected distance of 1.3kpc, bridged by weak line emission that is co-spatially
located with the cold-dust-emission peak, suggesting a large amount of cold ISM in the interacting
region. (abridged)
