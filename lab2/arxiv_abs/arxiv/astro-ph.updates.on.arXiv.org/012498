An extensive study on the potassium abundances of late-type stars was carried out by applying the
non-LTE spectrum-fitting analysis to the K I resonance line at 7698.96A to a large sample of 160 FGK
dwarfs and 328 late-G /early-K giants (including 89 giants in the Kepler field with seismologically
known ages) belonging to the disk population (-1 < [Fe/H] < 0.5), which may provide important observational
constraint on the nucleosynthesis history of K in the galactic disk. Special attention was paid
to clarifying the observed behaviors of [K/Fe] in terms of [Fe/H] along with stellar age, and to checking
whether giants and dwarfs yield consistent results with each other. The following results were
obtained. (1) A slightly increasing tendency of [K/Fe] with a decrease in [Fe/H] (d[K/Fe]/d[Fe/H]
~ -0.1 to -0.15; a shallower slope than reported by previous studies) was confirmed for FGK dwarfs,
though thick-disk stars tend to show larger [K/Fe] deviating from this gradient. (2) Almost similar
characteristics was observed also for apparently bright field giants locating in the solar neighborhood
(such as like dwarfs). (3) However, the [K/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relation for more distant {\it Kepler}
giants shows larger scatter and is systematically higher (by <~0.1dex) than that of dwarfs, implying
that chemical evolution of K is rather diversified depending on the position in the Galaxy. (4) Regarding
the age-dependence, a marginal trend of increasing [K/Fe] with age is recognized for dwarfs, while
any systematic tendency is not observed for Kepler giants. These consequences may suggest that
evolution of [K/Fe] with time in the galactic disk does exist but proceeded more gradually than previously
thought, and its condition is appreciably location-dependent.
