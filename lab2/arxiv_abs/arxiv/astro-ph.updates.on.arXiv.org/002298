High resolution spectroscopic observations of AW UMa, obtained on three consecutive nights with
the median time resolution of 2.1 minutes, have been analyzed using the Broadening Functions method
in the spectral window of 22.75 nm around the 518 nm Mg I triplet region. Doppler images of the system
reveal the presence of vigorous mass motions within the binary system. The ample evidence of a non-solid-body
velocity field puts into question the contact-binary model based on solid-body equipotentials.
AW UMa is a semi-detached binary; the mass transfer takes place from the more massive to the less massive
component. The primary, a fast-rotating star with Vsin i = 181.4 km/s, is covered by inhomogeneities:
very slowly drifting spots and a dense network of ripples more closely participating in its rotation.
The spectral lines of the primary show an additional broadening component (called the "pedestal")
which originates either in the equatorial regions which rotate faster than the rest of the star by
about 50 km/s or in an external disk-like structure. The secondary component appears to be smaller
than predicted by the contact model. The radial velocity field around the secondary is dominated
by accretion of matter transferred from (and possibly partly returned to) the primary component.
The parameters of the binary are: Asin i = 2.72+/-0.08 R(Sun) and M1sin^3i = 1.28+/-0.09 M(Sun),
M2sin^3i = 0.127+/-0.009 M(Sun). The mass ratio q = M2/M1 = 0.099+/-0.003 is substantially different
from the previous numerous and mutually consistent photometric investigations which were based
on the contact model; it remains to be studied why photometry and spectroscopy give so very discrepant
results.
