A simple look at the steady high-energy Universe reveals a clear correlation with outflows generated
around compact objects (winds and jets). In the case of relativistic jets, they are thought to be
produced as a consequence of the extraction of rotational energy from a Kerr black hole (Blandford-Znajek),
or from the disc (Blandford-Payne). A fraction of the large energy budget provided by accretion
and/or black hole rotational energy is invested into jet formation. After formation, the acceleration
and collimation of these outflows allow them to propagate to large distances away from the compact
object. The synchrotron cooling times demand that re-acceleration of particles takes place along
the jets to explain high-energy and very-high-energy emission from kiloparsec scales. At these
scales, jets in radio galaxies are divided in two main morphological/luminosity types, namely,
Fanaroff-Riley type I and II (FRI, FRII), the latter being more luminous, collimated and edge-brightened
than the former, which show clear hints of decollimation and deceleration. In this contribution,
I summarise a set of mechanisms that may contribute to dissipate magnetic and kinetic energy: Magnetohydrodynamic
instabilities or jet-obstacle interactions trigger shocks, shearing and mixing, which are plausible
scenarios for particle acceleration. I also derive an expression for the expected distance in which
the entrainment by stellar winds starts to be relevant, which is applicable to FRI jets. Finally,
I discuss the differences in the evolutionary scenarios and the main dissipative mechanisms that
take place in extragalactic and microquasar jets.
