We present monitoring campaign observations at optical and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths for
a radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN) at z=0.840, SDSS~J110006.07+442144.3 (hereafter,
J1100+4421), which was identified during a flare phase in late February, 2014. The campaigns consist
of three intensive observing runs from the discovery to March, 2015, mostly within the scheme of
the OISTER collaboration. Optical-NIR light curves and simultaneous spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) are obtained. Our measurements show the strongest brightening in March, 2015. We found that
the optical-NIR SEDs of J1100+4421 show an almost steady shape despite the large and rapid intranight
variability. This constant SED shape is confirmed to extend to $\sim5~\mu$m in the observed frame
using the archival WISE data. Given the lack of absorption lines and the steep power-law spectrum
of $\alpha_{\nu}\sim-1.4$, where $f_{\nu}\propto\nu^{\alpha_{\nu}}$, synchrotron radiation
by a relativistic jet with no or small contributions from the host galaxy and the accretion disk seems
most plausible as an optical-NIR emission mechanism. The steep optical-NIR spectral shape and
the large amplitude of variability are consistent with this object being a low $\nu_{\rm{peak}}$
jet-dominated AGN. In addition, sub-arcsec resolution optical imaging data taken with Subaru
Hyper Suprime-Cam does not show a clear extended component and the spatial scales are significantly
smaller than the large extensions detected at radio wavelengths. The optical spectrum of a possible
faint companion galaxy does not show any emission lines at the same redshift and hence a merging hypothesis
for this AGN-related activity is not supported by our observations.
