The outer solar system has a diverse range of objects, holding important clues about the formation
and evolution of our solar system, the emergence and current distribution of life, and the physical
processes controlling both our own and exoplanetary systems. This White Paper summarizes the Outer
Planets Analysis Group's (OPAG's) priorities in the Decadal Survey. Taking into account the science
to be achieved, the timing of solar system events, technological readiness, and programmatic factors,
our mission recommendations are as follows. OPAG strongly endorses the completion and launch of
the Europa Clipper mission, maintaining the science capabilities identified upon its selection,
and a Juno extended mission at Jupiter. For the decade 2023-2032, OPAG endorses a new start for two
directed missions: first, a mission to Neptune or Uranus with atmospheric probe(s), and second,
a life detection Ocean World mission, along with additional technological development for life
detection. A Neptune mission is preferred because, while the Neptune and Uranus systems provide
equally compelling opportunities, Triton is a higher priority ocean world target than the Uranian
satellites. The mission to Neptune or Uranus should fly first because a delay threatens key science
objectives, and additional technological development is required for a directed life detection
mission. Along with missions, we emphasize the necessity of maintaining a healthy Research and
Analysis (R&A) program as well as a robust Earth-based observing program. OPAG's top two technology
priorities are rapid development of a next-generation radioisotope power source for a mission
to Neptune or Uranus, and development of key life detection technologies in support of an Ocean World
mission. Finally, fostering an interdisciplinary, diverse, equitable, inclusive, and accessible
community is of top importance to the OPAG community.
