The LIGO/Virgo Scientific Collaboration (LVC) recently announced the detection of a compact object
binary merger, GW190425, with a total mass of $3.4^{+0.3}_{-0.1}$ M$_{\odot}$, and individual
component masses in the range of about 1.1 to 2.5 $M_{\odot}$. If the constituent compact objects
are neutron stars, then the total mass is five standard deviations higher than the mean of $2.66\pm
0.12$ M$_{\odot}$ for Galactic binary neutron stars (BNSs). LVC suggests such massive BNS systems
are born from a fast-merging channel, and therefore, their non-detection in the Galaxy to be due
to a selection effect. However, we are unable to reconcile the inferred formation efficiency from
the reported merger rate, $\mathcal{R}_{\rm GW190425}=460^{+1050}_{-390}$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$,
with predictions from our own study for fast-merging BNS systems. Moreover, the comparable merger
rates of GW190425, and GW170817 are possibly in tension with our results for two reasons: (i) more
massive systems are expected to have a lower formation rate, and (ii) fast merging channels should
constitute $\lesssim 10\%$ of the total BNS systems if case BB unstable mass transfer is permitted
to take place as a formation pathway. We argue that to account for the high merger rate of GW190425
as a BNS system requires: (i) revisiting our understanding of NS formation in supernova explosions,
or (ii): that more massive NSs need to be preferentially born with either very weak or very high magnetic
fields so that they would be undetectable in the radio surveys. Perhaps massive NSs detected in NS-white
dwarf binaries are our clues to the formation path of GW190425 systems.
