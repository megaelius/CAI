Understanding the evolution of Earth and potentially habitable Earth-like worlds is essential
to fathom our origin in the Universe. The search for Earth-like planets in the habitable zone and
investigation of their atmospheres with climate and photochemical models is a central focus in
exoplanetary science. Taking the evolution of Earth as a reference for Earth-like planets, a central
scientific goal is to understand what the interactions were between atmosphere, geology, and biology
on early Earth. The Great Oxidation Event (GOE) in Earth's history was certainly caused by their
interplay, but the origin and controlling processes of this occurrence are not well understood,
the study of which will require interdisciplinary, coupled models. In this work, we present results
from our newly developed Coupled Atmosphere Biogeochemistry model in which atmospheric O$_2$
concentrations are fixed to values inferred by geological evidence. Applying a unique tool, ours
is the first quantitative analysis of catalytic cycles that governed O$_2$ in early Earth's atmosphere
near the GOE. Complicated oxidation pathways play a key role in destroying O$_2$, whereas in the
upper atmosphere, most O$_2$ is formed abiotically via CO$_2$ photolysis. The O$_2$ bistability
found by Goldblatt et al. (2006) is not observed in our calculations likely due to our detailed CH$_4$
oxidation scheme. We calculate increased CH$_4$ with increasing O$_2$ during the GOE. For a given
atmospheric surface flux, different atmospheric states are possible; however, the net primary
productivity (NPP) of the biosphere that produces O$_2$ is unique. Mixing, CH$_4$ fluxes, ocean
solubility, and mantle/crust properties strongly affect NPP and surface O$_2$ fluxes. Regarding
exoplanets, different "states" of O$_2$ could exist for similar biomass output. Strong geological
activity could lead to false negatives for life.
