We report ALMA observations with resolution $\approx0.5$" at 3 mm of the extended Sgr B2 cloud in
the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). We detect 271 compact sources, most of which are smaller than 5000
AU. By ruling out alternative possibilities, we conclude that these sources consist of a mix of hypercompact
HII regions and young stellar objects (YSOs). Most of the newly-detected sources are YSOs with gas
envelopes which, based on their luminosities, must contain objects with stellar masses $M_*\gtrsim8$
M$_\odot$. Their spatial distribution spread over a $\sim12\times3$ pc region demonstrates that
Sgr B2 is experiencing an extended star formation event, not just an isolated `starburst' within
the protocluster regions. Using this new sample, we examine star formation thresholds and surface
density relations in Sgr B2. While all of the YSOs reside in regions of high column density ($N(H_2)\gtrsim2\times10^{23}$
cm$^{-2}$), not all regions of high column density contain YSOs. The observed column density threshold
for star formation is substantially higher than that in solar vicinity clouds, implying either
that high-mass star formation requires a higher column density or that any star formation threshold
in the CMZ must be higher than in nearby clouds. The relation between the surface density of gas and
stars is incompatible with extrapolations from local clouds, and instead stellar densities in
Sgr B2 follow a linear $\Sigma_*-\Sigma_{gas}$ relation, shallower than that observed in local
clouds. Together, these points suggest that a higher volume density threshold is required to explain
star formation in CMZ clouds.
