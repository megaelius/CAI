We present sensitive 850$\mu$m imaging of the COSMOS field using 640hr of new and archival observations
taken with SCUBA-2 at the East Asian Observatory's James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. The SCUBA-2 COSMOS
survey (S2COSMOS) achieves a median noise level of $\sigma_{850\mu{\mathrm{m}}}$=1.2mJy/beam
over an area of 1.6 sq. degree (MAIN; HST/ACS footprint), and $\sigma_{850\mu{\mathrm{m}}}$=1.7mJy/beam
over an additional 1 sq. degree of supplementary (SUPP) coverage. We present a catalogue of 1020
and 127 sources detected at a significance level of >4$\sigma$ and >4.3$\sigma$ in the MAIN and SUPP
regions, respectively, corresponding to a uniform 2% false-detection rate. We construct the single-dish
850$\mu$m number counts at $S_{850}$>2mJy and show that these S2COSMOS counts are in agreement
with previous single-dish surveys, demonstrating that degree-scale fields are sufficient to
overcome the effects of cosmic variance in the $S_{850}$=2-10mJy population. To investigate the
properties of the galaxies identified by S2COSMOS sources we measure the surface density of near-infrared-selected
galaxies around their positions and identify an average excess of 2.0$\pm$0.2 galaxies within
a 13$''$ radius (~100kpc at $z$~2). The bulk of these galaxies represent near-infrared-selected
SMGs and/or spatially-correlated sources and lie at a median photometric redshift of $z$=2.0$\pm$0.1.
Finally, we perform a stacking analysis at sub-millimeter and far-infrared wavelengths of stellar-mass-selected
galaxies ($M_{\star}$=10$^{10}$-10$^{12}{\rm M_{\odot}}$) from $z$=0-4, obtaining high-significance
detections at 850um in all subsets (SNR=4-30), and investigate the relation between far-infrared
luminosity, stellar mass, and the peak wavelength of the dust SED. The publication of this survey
adds a new deep, uniform sub-millimeter layer to the wavelength coverage of this well-studied COSMOS
field.
