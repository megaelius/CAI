We exploit ALMA 870um (345GHz) observations of submillimetre sources in the Extended Chandra Deep
Field South to investigate the far-infrared properties of high-redshift submillimetre galaxies
(SMGs). Using the precisely located 870um ALMA positions of 99 SMGs, together with 24um and radio
imaging of this field, we deblend the Herschel/SPIRE imaging of this region to extract their far-infrared
fluxes and colours. The median photometric redshifts for ALMA LESS (ALESS) SMGs which are detected
in at least two SPIRE bands increases with wavelength of the peak in their SEDs, with z=2.3+/-0.2,
2.5+/-0.3 and 3.5+/-0.5 for the 250, 350 and 500-um peakers respectively. We find that 34 ALESS SMGs
do not have a >3-sigma counterpart at 250, 350 or 500-um. These galaxies have a median photometric
redshift of z=3.3+/-0.5, which is higher than the full ALESS SMG sample; z=2.5+/-0.2. Using the
photometric redshifts together with the 250-870um photometry, we estimate the far-infrared luminosities
and characteristic dust temperature of each SMG. The median infrared luminosity of the S_870um>2mJy
SMGs is L_IR=(3.0+/-0.3)x10^{12}Lo(SFR=300+/-30Mo/yr). At a fixed luminosity, the characteristic
dust temperature of these high-redshift SMGs is 2-3K lower than comparably luminous galaxies at
z=0, reflecting the more extended star formation occurring in these systems. By extrapolating
the 870um number counts to S_ 870um=1mJy, we show that the contribution of S_870um>1mJy SMGs
to the cosmic star formation budget is 20% of the total over the redshift range z~1-4. We derive a median
dust mass for these SMGs of M_d=(3.6+/-0.3)x10^8Mo and by adopting an appropriate gas-to-dust
ratio, we estimate an average molecular mass of M_H2=(4.2+/-0.4)x10^{10}Mo. Finally, we use our
estimates of the H2 masses to show that SMGs with S_870um>1mJy contain ~10% of the z~2 volume-averaged
H2 mass density at this epoch.
