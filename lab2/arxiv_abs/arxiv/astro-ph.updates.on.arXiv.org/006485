We present results of an archival coincidence analysis between Fermi LAT gamma-ray data and public
neutrino data from the IceCube neutrino observatory's 40-string (IC40) and 59-string (IC59) observing
runs. Our analysis has the potential to detect either a statistical excess of neutrino + gamma-ray
($\nu$+$\gamma$) emitting transients or, alternatively, individual high gamma-multiplicity
events, as might be produced by a neutrino observed by IceCube coinciding with a LAT-detected gamma-ray
burst. Dividing the neutrino data into three datasets by hemisphere (IC40, IC59-North, and IC59-South),
we construct uncorrelated null distributions by Monte Carlo scrambling of the neutrino datasets.
We carry out signal-injection studies against these null distributions, demonstrating sensitivity
to individual $\nu$+$\gamma$ events of sufficient gamma-ray multiplicity, and to $\nu$+$\gamma$
transient populations responsible for $>$14% (IC40), $>$9% (IC59-North), or $>$8% (IC59-South)
of the gamma-coincident neutrinos observed in these datasets, respectively. Analyzing the unscrambled
neutrino data, we identify no individual high-significance neutrino + high gamma-multiplicity
events, and no significant deviations from the test statistic null distributions. However, we
observe a similar and unexpected pattern in the IC59-North and IC59-South residual distributions
that we conclude reflects a possible correlation ($p=7.0\%$) between IC59 neutrino positions
and persistently bright portions of the Fermi gamma-ray sky. This possible correlation should
be readily testable using eight years of further data already collected by IceCube. We are currently
working with Astrophysical Multimessenger Observatory Network (AMON) partner facilities to
generate low-latency $\nu$+$\gamma$ alerts from Fermi LAT gamma-ray, IceCube and ANTARES neutrino
data and distribute these in real time to AMON follow-up partners.
