We imaged with ALMA and ARGOS/LUCI the molecular gas and the dust and stellar continuum in XID2028,
an obscured QSO at z=1.593, where the presence of a massive outflow in the ionized gas component traced
by the [O III]5007 emission has been resolved up to 10 kpc. This target represents a unique test case
to study QSO 'feedback in action' at the peak epoch of AGN-galaxy coevolution. The QSO has been detected
in the CO(5-4) transition and in the 1.3mm continuum, at ~30 and ~20 {\sigma} significance respectively,
with both emissions confined in the central (<4 kpc) radius area. Our analysis suggests the presence
of a fast rotating molecular disc (v~400 km/s) on very compact scales, and well inside the galaxy
extent seen in the rest-frame optical light (~10 kpc, as inferred from the LUCI data). Adding available
measurements in additional two CO transitions, CO(2-1) and CO(3-2), we could derive a total gas
mass of ~10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$, thanks to a critical assessment of CO excitation and the comparison
with Rayleigh-Jeans continuum estimate. This translates into a very low gas fraction (<5%) and
depletion time scales of 40-75 Myr, reinforcing the result of atypical gas consumption conditions
in XID2028, possibly due to feedback effects on the host galaxy. Finally, we also detect at ~5{\sigma}
the presence of high velocity CO gas, which we interpret as a signature of galaxy-scale molecular
outflow, spatially coincident with the ionised gas outflow. XID2028 represents therefore a unique
case where the measurement of total outflowing mass (~500-800 M$_\odot$/yr) including the molecular
and atomic components, in both the ionised and neutral phases, has been attempted for a high-z QSO.
