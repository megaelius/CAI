We present the results of a systematic search and characterisation of jellyfish galaxy candidates
in the multi-cluster system A901/2, at z ~ 0.165, as part of the OMEGA survey. By visual inspecting
ACS/HST F606W images looking for morphological signatures of ram-pressure stripping events in
Halpha-emitting galaxies, we identify a total of 70 candidates. Out of these, 53 are clearly star-forming
galaxies and 5 are highly probable AGN hosts, the classification of the remaining galaxies is more
uncertain. They have late-type and irregular morphologies and most of them are part of the blue cloud
with only 4 being previously classified as dusty reds. The AGN activity is not prominent in the sample
and, of the few cases of galaxies hosting AGN, such activity does not seem to be correlated to the gas
stripping phenomenon. Our jellyfish galaxy candidates do not have a preferential pattern of motion
within the multi-cluster system, although the most compelling cases appear to inhabit the inner
regions of the most massive sub-cluster centres. The sSFR of these galaxies indicates that their
star formation activity is enhanced, in contrast with what is observed for the rest of the star-forming
galaxy population in the system. Half of the sample is forming stars at a higher rate than the main-sequence
for field galaxies and this behaviour is more evident for the most compelling candidates. For some
galaxies, the spatially resolved Halpha emission appears to be as disturbed and extended as their
continuum counterparts. Our findings point towards a scenario where the ram pressure stripping
is triggering a period of intense and extended star formation throughout the galaxy while it is also
disturbing the morphology. This is the largest sample of jellyfish galaxy candidates found in a
single system suggesting that cluster mergers might be the ideal environment for studying ram pressure
stripping effects.
