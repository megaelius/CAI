The presence of massive neutrinos has a characteristic impact on the growth of large scale structures
such as galaxy clusters. We forecast on the capability of the number count and power spectrum measured
from the ongoing and future Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) cluster surveys, combined with cosmic microwave
background (CMB) observation to constrain the total neutrino mass $\mnu$ in a flat $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology. We adopt self-calibration for the mass-observable scaling relation, and evaluate
constraints for the South Pole Telescope normal and with polarization (SPT, SPTPol), Planck, and
Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarization (ACTPol) surveys. We find that a sample of $\approx1000$
clusters obtained from the Planck cluster survey plus extra information from CMB lensing extraction
could tighten the current upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses to $\sigma_{\mnu}=0.17$ eV at
68% C.L. Our analysis shows that cluster number counts and power spectrum provide complementary
constraints and as a result they help reducing the error bars on $\mnu$ by a factor of 4-8 when both
probes are combined. We also show that the main strength of cluster measurements in constraining
$\mnu$ is when good control of cluster systematics is available. When applying a weak prior on the
mass-observable relations, which can be at reach in the upcoming cluster surveys, we obtain $\sigma_{\mnu}=0.48$
eV using cluster only probes and, more interestingly, $\sigma_{\mnu}=0.08$ eV using cluster +
CMB which corresponds to a $S/N\approx4$ detection for $\mnu\ge0.3$ eV. We analyze and discuss
the degeneracies of $\mnu$ with other parameters and investigate the sensitivity of neutrino mass
constraints with various surveys specifications.
