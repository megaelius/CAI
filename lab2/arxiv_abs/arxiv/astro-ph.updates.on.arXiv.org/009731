High-resolution (0."03 - 0."09) (9 - 26 pc)) ALMA (100 - 350 GHz (3 - 0.8 mm)) and VLA 45 GHz measurements
have been used to image continuum and spectral line emission from the inner region of the nearby infrared
luminous galaxy IC 860. We detect compact (r=8-10 pc), luminous, mm continuum emission in the core
of IC 860, with brightness temperatures $T_{\rm B}>$ 280 K. The 45 GHz continuum is equally compact,
but fainter in flux. We suggest that the 3 to 0.8 mm continuum is opaque at mm-wavelengths, implying
a very large H$_2$ column density $N$(H$_2$) of 1e26 cm-2, and that it emerges from hot dust with temperature
$T_{\rm d} \sim 280$ K. Vibrationally excited lines of HCN $\nu_2$=1f J=4-3 and 3-2 (HCN-VIB) are
seen in emission and resolved on scales of 40-50 pc. The HCN-VIB emission reveals a north-south nuclear
velocity gradient with projected rotation velocities of v=100 kms$^{-1}$ at r=10 pc. The brightest
HCN-VIB emission is oriented perpendicular to the velocity gradient. Ground state lines of HCN
3-2, 4-3, HC$^{15}$N 4-3, HCO$^+$ 3-2, 4-3 and CS 7-6, show complex line absorption and emission
features. HCN and HCO$^+$ have red-shifted, reversed P-Cygni profiles consistent with gas inflows
of $\sim$50 kms$^{-1}$. The absorption features can be traced from the north-east into the nucleus.
In contrast, CS 7-6 shows blue-shifted line wings extending to -(150-180) kms$^{-1}$. We suggest
that a dense and slow outflow is hidden behind a foreground layer of inflowing gas. It appears that
the centre of IC 860 is in a phase of rapid evolution where an inflow is building up the nuclear column
density of gas. A slow, dense outflow may be signalling the onset of feedback. The inner, r=10 pc,
IR luminosity can be powered by an accreting black hole and/or a compact starburst with a top-heavy
initial mass function.
