The ancestor philosophers' dream of thousands of new worlds is finally realised: about 3500 extrasolar
planets have been discovered in the neighborhood of our Sun. Most of them are very different from
those we used to know in our Solar System. Others orbit their parent star inside the belt known as Habitable
Zone where a rocky planet with the appropriate climate could have the availability of liquid water
on its surface. Those planets, in HZ or not, will be the object of observation that will be performed
by new space-/ground-based instrumentation. Space missions, such as JWST and the very recently
proposed ARIEL (ESA M-Class Mission), or ground based instruments (SPHERE@VLT, GPI@GEMINI and
EPICS@ELT) have been proposed and built to measure the atmospheric transmission, reflection and
emission spectra over a wide wavelength range. Most of exoplanets have local counterparts in the
Solar System planets that are available for comparative studies, but there are also interesting
outsider cases like super Earths. In our own system, proto-planet evolution was flanked by an active
prebiotic chemistry that brought about the emergency of life on the Earth. The search for life signatures
requires the knowledge of planet atmospheres, main objective of future exoplanetary space explorations.
As, for now, we have only one example of life in the universe, we are bound to study terrestrial organisms
to assess possibilities of life on other planets and guide our search for possible extinct or extant
life on other planetary bodies. The planet atmosphere characteristics and possible biosignatures
will be inferred by studying such composite spectrum in order to identify the emission/absorption
lines/bands from atmospheric molecules as water, carbon monoxide, methane, ammonia etc.
