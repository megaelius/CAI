We derive the physical properties at the base of the jet from DG Tau both along and across the flow and
as a function of velocity. We analysed seven optical spectra of the DG Tau jet, taken with the Hubble
Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. The spectra were obtained by placing a long-slit parallel
to the jet axis and stepping it across the jet width. The resulting position-velocity diagrams in
optical forbidden emission lines allowed access to plasma conditions via calculation of emission
line ratios. We find at the base of the jet high electron density, $n_e \sim $ 10$^5$, and very low ionisation,
$x_e \sim 0.02-0.05$, which combine to give a total density up to $n_H \sim $ 3 10$^6$. This analysis
confirms previous reports of variations in plasma parameters along the jet, (i.e. decrease in density
by several orders of magnitude, increase of $x_e$ from 0.05 to a plateau at 0.7 downstream at 2$''$
from the star). Furthermore, a spatial coincidence is revealed between sharp gradients in the total
density and supersonic velocity jumps. This strongly suggests that the emission is caused by shock
excitation. The position-velocity diagrams indicate the presence of both fast accelerating gas
and slower, less collimated material. We derive the mass outflow rate, $\dot{M}_j$, in the blue-shifted
lobe in different velocity channels, that contribute to a total of $\dot{M}_j \sim$ 8 $\pm$ 4 10$^{-9}$
M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. We estimate that a symmetric bipolar jet would transport at the low and intermediate
velocities probed by rotation measurements, an angular momentum flux of $\dot{L}_j \sim$ 2.9 $\pm$
1.5 10$^{-6}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ AU km s$^{-1}$. The derived properties of the DG Tau jet are demonstrated
to be consistent with magneto-centrifugal theory. However, non-stationary modelling is required
in order to explain all of the features revealed at high resolution.
