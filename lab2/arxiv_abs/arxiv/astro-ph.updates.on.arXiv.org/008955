The Bubble Nebula (or NGC 7635) is a parsec-scale seemingly spherical wind-blown bubble around
the relatively unevolved O star BD+60$^\circ$2522. The small dynamical age of the nebula and significant
space velocity of the star suggest that the Bubble Nebula might be a bow shock. We have run 2D hydrodynamic
simulations to model the interaction of the central star's wind with the interstellar medium (ISM).
The models cover a range of possible ISM number densities of $n=50-200 {\rm cm}^{-3}$ and stellar
velocities of $v_{\star}=20-40$ km s$^{-1}$. Synthetic H$\alpha$ and 24 $\mu$m emission maps
predict the same apparent spherical bubble shape with quantitative properties similar to observations.
The synthetic maps also predict a maximum brightness similar to that from the observations and agree
that the maximum brightness is at the apex of the bow shock. The best-matching simulation had $v_{\star}\approx20$
km s$^{-1}$ into an ISM with $n\sim100 {\rm cm}^{-3}$, at an angle of 60$^\circ$ with respect to the
line of sight. Synthetic maps of soft ($0.3-2$ keV) and hard ($2-10$ keV) X-ray emission show that
the brightest region is in the wake behind the star and not at the bow shock itself. The unabsorbed
soft X-rays have luminosity $\sim10^{32}-10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The hard X-rays are fainter,
luminosity $\sim 10^{30} - 10^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and may be too faint for current X-ray instruments
to successfully observe. Our results imply that the O star creates a bow shock as it moves through
the ISM and in turn creates an asymmetric bubble visible at optical and infrared wavelengths, and
predicted to be visible in X-rays. The Bubble Nebula does not appear to be unique, it could be just
a favourably oriented very dense bow shock. The dense ISM surrounding BD+60$^\circ$2522 and its
strong wind suggest that it could be a good candidate for detecting non-thermal emission.
