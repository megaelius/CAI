We use N-body simulations to examine whether a characteristic turnaround radius, as predicted
from the spherical collapse model in a $\rm {\Lambda CDM}$ Universe, can be meaningfully identified
for galaxy clusters, in the presence of full three-dimensional effects. We use The Dark Sky Simulations
and Illustris-TNG dark-matter--only cosmological runs to calculate radial velocity profiles
around collapsed structures, extending out to many times the virial radius $R_{200}$. There, the
turnaround radius can be unambiguously identified as the largest non-expanding scale around a
center of gravity. We find that: (a) Indeed, a single turnaround scale can meaningfully describe
strongly non-spherical structures. (b) For halos of masses $M_{200}>10^{13}M_\odot$, the turnaround
radius $R_{ta}$ scales with the enclosed mass $M_{ta}$ as $M_{ta}^{1/3}$, as predicted by the spherical
collapse model. (c) The deviation of $R_{ta}$ in simulated halos from the spherical collapse model
prediction is insensitive to halo asphericity. Rather, it is sensitive to the tidal forces due to
massive neighbors when such are present. (d) Halos exhibit a characteristic average density within
the turnaround scale. This characteristic density is dependent on cosmology and redshift. For
the present cosmic epoch and for concordance cosmological parameters ($\Omega_m \sim 0.7$; $\Omega_\Lambda
\sim 0.3$) turnaround structures exhibit an average matter density contrast with the background
Universe of $\delta \sim 11$. Thus $R_{ta}$ is equivalent to $R_{11}$ -- in a way analogous to defining
the "virial" radius as $R_{200}$ -- with the advantage that $R_{11}$ is shown in this work to correspond
to a kinematically relevant scale in N-body simulations.
