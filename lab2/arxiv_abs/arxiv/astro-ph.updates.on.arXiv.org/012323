Hydrogen deuteride (HD) rotational line emission can provide reliable protoplanetary disk gas
mass measurements, but it is difficult to observe and detections have been limited to three T-Tauri
disks. No new data have been available since the \emph{Herschel} Space Observatory mission ended
in 2013. We set out to obtain new disk gas mass constraints by analysing upper limits on HD 1-0 emission
in \emph{Herschel}/PACS archival data from the DIGIT key programme. With a focus on the Herbig Ae/Be
disks, whose stars are more luminous than T Tauris, we determine upper limits for HD in data previosly
analysed for its line detections. Their significance is studied with a grid of models run with the
DALI physical-chemical code, customised to include deuterium chemistry. Nearly all the disks
are constrained to $M_{\rm gas}\leq0.1\,$M$_{\odot}$, ruling out global gravitational instability.
A strong constraint is obtained for the HD 163296 disk mass, $M_{\rm gas} \leq 0.067\,$M$_{\odot}$,
implying $\Delta_{\rm g/d}\leq100$. This HD-based mass limit is towards the low end of CO-based
mass estimates for the disk, highlighting the large uncertainty in using only CO and suggesting
that gas-phase CO depletion in HD 163296 is at most a factor of a few. The $M_{\rm gas}$ limits for HD
163296 and HD 100546, both bright disks with massive candidate protoplanetary systems, suggest
disk-to-planet mass conversion efficiencies of $M_{\rm p}/(M_{\rm gas} + M_{\rm p})\approx10$
to $40\,$% for present-day values. Near-future observations with SOFIA/HIRMES will be able to
detect HD in the brightest Herbig~Ae/Be disks within $150\,$pc with $\approx10\,$h integration
time.
