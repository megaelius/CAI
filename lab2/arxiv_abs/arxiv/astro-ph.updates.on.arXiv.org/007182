Context. In dense clouds, hydrogenation reactions on icy dust grains are key in the formation of
molecules, like formaldehyde, methanol, and complex organic molecules (COMs). These species
form through the sequential hydrogenation of CO ice. Although molecular hydrogen (H2) abundances
can be four orders of magnitude higher than those of free H-atoms in dense clouds, H2 surface chemistry
has been largely ignored; several laboratory studies show that H2 does not actively participate
in non-energetic ice chemistry because of the high activation energies required. Aims. For the
example of CO ice hydrogenation, we experimentally investigated the potential role of H2 molecules
on the surface chemistry when energetic processing (i.e., UV photolysis) is involved. We test whether
additional hydrogenation pathways become available upon UV irradiation of a CO:H2 ice mixture
and whether this reaction mechanism also applies to other chemical systems. Methods. Ultra-high
vacuum (UHV) experiments were performed at 8~20 K. A pre-deposited solid mixture of CO:H2 was irradiated
with UV-photons. Reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) was used as an in situ diagnostic
tool. Single reaction steps and possible isotopic effects were studied by comparing results from
CO:H2 and CO:D2 ice mixtures. Results. After UV-irradiation of a CO:H2 ice mixture, two photon-induced
products, HCO and H2CO, are unambiguously detected. The proposed reaction mechanism involves
electronically excited CO in the following reaction steps: CO + h{\nu}->CO*, CO* + H2->HCO + H where
newly formed H-atoms are then available for further hydrogenation reactions. The HCO formation
yields have a strong temperature dependence for the investigated regime, which is most likely linked
to the H2 sticking coefficient. Finally, the astronomical relevance of this photo-induced reaction
channel is discussed.
