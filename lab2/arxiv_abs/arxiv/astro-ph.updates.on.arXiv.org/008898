Double-line eclipsing binaries (DLEBs) have been recently used to constrain the amount of central
mixing as a function of stellar mass, with contrasting results. In this work, we reanalyze the DLEB
sample by Claret & Torres, using a Bayesian method and new PARSEC tracks that account for both convective
core overshooting and rotational mixing. Using overshooting alone we obtain that, for masses larger
than about 1.9 M$_{\odot}$, the distribution of the overshooting parameter, $\lambda_\mathrm{ov}$,
has a wide dispersion between 0.3 and 0.8, with essentially no values below $\lambda_\mathrm{ov}=$
0.3 - 0.4. While the lower limit supports a mild convective overshooting efficiency, the large dispersion
derived is difficult to explain in the framework of current models of that process, which leave little
room for large randomness. We suggest that a simple interpretation of our results can be rotational
mixing: different initial rotational velocities, in addition to a fixed amount of overshooting,
could reproduce the high dispersion derived for intermediate-mass stars. After a reanalysis of
the data, we find good agreement with models computed with fixed overshooting parameter, $\lambda_\mathrm{ov}=0.4$,
and initial rotational rates, $\omega$, uniformly distributed in a wide range between $0$ and $0.8$
times the break-up value, at varying initial mass. We also find that our best-fitting models for
the components of $\alpha$ Aurigae and TZ Fornacis, agree with their observed rotational velocities,
thus providing independent support to our hypothesis. We conclude that a constant efficiency of
overshooting in concurrence with a star-to-star variation in the rotational mixing, might be crucial
in the interpretation of such data.
