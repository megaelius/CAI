More than 140 isolated non-recurrent geomagnetic storms (GMSs) of various intensities from extreme
to weak are considered, which are reliably identified with solar eruptive sources (coronal mass
ejections, CMEs). The analysis aims to obtain a possibly complete picture of the relationship between
the transit time of propagation of CMEs and interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) from
the Sun to the Earth (more precisely, the time interval dtp from the moment of an eruption until the
peak of the corresponding GMS) and the maximum intensity of this GMS, as measured by the disturbance
storm time geomagnetic index Dst. Two groups of events are singled out: one includes GMSs, the source
of which was an eruption from an active region (AR events), the other GMSs caused by filament eruptions
from quiescent areas of the Sun located outside ARs (QS events). The distribution of the large number
of the analyzed events on a dtp - Dst plane confirms and substantially clarifies the known regularities.
The AR events are characterized by a shorter transit time (dtp ~ 1-4 days) and much stronger GMSs (Dst
up to -600 nT mainly) in comparison with the QS events (dtp ~ 3-5 days, Dst > -200 nT). For events of both
groups, the shorter transit time of CMEs/ICMEs, the more intense GMSs; in particular, for AR events
when dtp declines from 4 to 1 day, Dst decreases on average from -100 to -470 nT and can reach -900 nT.
From the point of view of the nature of GMSs and their sources on the Sun, the obtained results mean
that both the speed of CMEs/ICMEs and the strength of the magnetic field transferred by them are largely
determined by the parameters of the corresponding eruptions, in particular, by the eruptive magnetic
flux and the released energy.
