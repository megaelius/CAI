We run a suite of dissipative N-body simulations to determine which regions of phase space for smooth
disk migration are consistent with the Gliese 876 system, an M-dwarf hosting three planets orbiting
in a chaotic 4:2:1 Laplace resonance. We adopt adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) methods which are
commonly used in hydrodynamical simulations to efficiently explore the parameter space defined
by the semi-major axis and eccentricity damping timescales. We find that there is a large region
of phase space which produces systems in the chaotic Laplace resonance and a smaller region consistent
with the observed eccentricities and libration amplitudes for the 2:1 and 4:2:1 resonant angles.
Under the assumptions of Type I migration for the outer Laplace planet, we translate these damping
timescales into constraints on the protoplanetary disk surface density and thickness. When we
strongly (weakly) damp the eccentricities of the inner two Laplace planets, these timescales correspond
to disk surface densities around ten thousand (a few hundred) grams per square centimeter and disk
aspect ratios between 1-10%. Additionally, smooth migration produces systems with a range of chaotic
timescales, from decades and centuries to upwards of thousands of years -- consistent with those
of the observed system. In agreement with previous studies, the less chaotic regions of phase space
coincide with the system being in a low energy double apsidal corotation resonance. Our detailed
modeling of multi-planetary systems coupled with our AMR exploration method enhances our ability
to map out the parameter space of planet formation models, and is well suited to study the migration
histories and disk properties of other resonant chain systems such as Trappist-1, Kepler-60, and
others.
