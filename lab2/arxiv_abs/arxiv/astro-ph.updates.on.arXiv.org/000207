We present an analysis of the spatial distribution of star formation in a sample of 60 visually identified
galaxy merger candidates at z>1. Our sample, drawn from the 3D-HST survey, is flux-limited and
was selected to have high star formation rates based on fits of their broad-band, low spatial resolution
spectral energy distributions. It includes plausible pre-merger (close pairs) and post-merger
(single objects with tidal features) systems, with total stellar masses and star formation rates
derived from multi-wavelength photometry. Here we use near-infrared slitless spectra from 3D-HST
which produce Halpha or [OIII] emission line maps as proxies for star-formation maps. This provides
a first comprehensive high-resolution, empirical picture of where star formation occurred in
galaxy mergers at the epoch of peak cosmic star formation rate. We find that detectable star formation
can occur in one or both galaxy centres, or in tidal tails. The most common case (58%) is that star formation
is largely concentrated in a single, compact region, coincident with the centre of (one of) the merger
components. No correlations between star formation morphology and redshift, total stellar mass,
or star formation rate are found. A restricted set of hydrodynamical merger simulations between
similarly massive and gas-rich objects implies that star formation should be detectable in both
merger components, when the gas fractions of the individual components are the same. This suggests
that z~1.5 mergers typically occur between galaxies whose gas fractions, masses, and/or star formation
rates are distinctly different from one another.
