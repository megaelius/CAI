Aims. We investigate the s-process during the AGB phase of stellar models whose cores are enforced
to rotate at rates consistent with asteroseismology observations of their progenitors and successors.
Methods. We calculated new 2M$_{\odot}$, Z=0.01 models, rotating at 0, 125, and 250 km/s at the start
of main sequence. An artificial, additional viscosity was added to enhance the transport of angular
momentum in order to reduce the core rotation rates to be in agreement with asteroseismology observations.
We compared rotation rates of our models with observed rotation rates during the MS up to the end of
core He burning, and the white dwarf phase. Results. We present nucleosynthesis calculations for
these rotating AGB models that were enforced to match the asteroseismic constraints on rotation
rates of MS, RGB, He-burning, and WD stars. In particular, we calculated one model that matches the
upper limit of observed rotation rates of core He-burning stars and we also included a model that
rotates one order of magnitude faster than the upper limit of the observations. The s-process production
in both of these models is comparable to that of non-rotating models. Conclusions. Slowing down
the core rotation rate in stars to match the above mentioned asteroseismic constraints reduces
the rotationally induced mixing processes to the point that they have no effect on the s-process
nucleosynthesis. This result is independent of the initial rotation rate of the stellar evolution
model. However, there are uncertainties remaining in the treatment of rotation in stellar evolution,
which need to be reduced in order to confirm our conclusions, including the physical nature of our
approach to reduce the core rotation rates of our models, and magnetic processes.
