We analyze 7.3 years of ANTARES high-energy neutrino and Fermi LAT {\gamma}-ray data in search of
cosmic neutrino + {\gamma}-ray ({\nu}+{\gamma}) transient sources or source populations. Our
analysis has the potential to detect either individual {\nu}+{\gamma} transient sources (durations
{\delta}t < 1000~s), if they exhibit sufficient {\gamma}-ray or neutrino multiplicity, or a statistical
excess of {\nu}+{\gamma} transients of lower multiplicities. Treating ANTARES track and cascade
event types separately, we establish detection thresholds by Monte Carlo scrambling of the neutrino
data, and determine our analysis sensitivity by signal injection against scrambled datasets.
We find our analysis is sensitive to {\nu}+{\gamma} transient populations responsible for $>$5\%
of the observed gamma-coincident neutrinos in the track data at 90\% confidence. Applying our analysis
to the unscrambled data reveals no individual {\nu}+{\gamma} events of high significance; two
ANTARES track + Fermi {\gamma}-ray events are identified that exceed a once per decade false alarm
rate threshold ($p=17\%$). No evidence for subthreshold {\nu}+{\gamma} source populations is
found among the track ($p=39\%$) or cascade ($p=60\%$) events. While TXS 0506+056, a blazar and
variable (non-transient) Fermi {\gamma}-ray source, has recently been identified as the first
source of high-energy neutrinos, the challenges in reconciling observations of the Fermi {\gamma}-ray
sky, the IceCube high-energy cosmic neutrinos, and ultra-high energy cosmic rays using only blazars
suggest a significant contribution by other source populations. Searches for transient sources
of high-energy neutrinos remain interesting, with the potential for neutrino clustering or multimessenger
coincidence searches to lead to discovery of the first {\nu}+{\gamma} transients.
