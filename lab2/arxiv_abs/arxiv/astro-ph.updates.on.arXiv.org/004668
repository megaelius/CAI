We use deep multi-epoch PSF photometry taken with the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for
Astronomy (VISTA) to measure and analyze the proper motions of stars within the Galactic globular
cluster 47 Tucanae (47 Tuc, NGC 104). The observations are part of the ongoing near-infrared VISTA
survey of the Magellanic Cloud system (VMC). The data analyzed here corresponds to one VMC tile and
covers a total sky area of 1.77 deg^2. Absolute proper motions with respect to ~9070 background galaxies
are calculated from a linear regression model applied to the stellar positions in 11 epochs in the
Ks filter. The data extend over a total time baseline of ~17 months. We found a median proper motion
of the stars within 47 Tuc of (mu_a cos(d), mu_d) = (+5.89 +/- 0.02(stat) +/- 0.13(sys), -2.14 +/-
0.02(stat) +/- 0.08(sys)) mas/yr, based on the measurements of ~35000 individual sources between
5' and 42' from the cluster center. We compared our result to the proper motions from the newest US
Naval Observatory CCD Astrograph Catalog (UCAC5) which includes data from the Gaia data release
1. Selecting cluster members (~2700 stars) we found a median proper motion of (mu_a cos(d), mu_d)
= (+5.30 +/- 0.03(stat) +/- 0.70(sys), -2.70 +/- 0.03(stat) +/- 0.70(sys)) mas/yr. The values derived
from the VMC data are consistent with the UCAC5 result, and are close to literature measurements
obtained using HST. We combined our results with literature radial velocity measurements and reconstructed
the orbit of 47 Tuc, finding that the cluster is on a low-ellipticity orbit and is confined within
the inner ~7.5 kpc of the Galaxy. We show that the use of an increased time baseline combined with PSF-determined
stellar centroids in crowded regions significantly improves the accuracy of the method. In future
works, we will apply this method to more VMC tiles to study in detail the kinematics of the Magellanic
Clouds.
