With the advent of wide-area submillimeter surveys, a large number of high-redshift gravitationally
lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) has been revealed. Due to the simplicity of the selection
criteria for candidate lensed sources in such surveys, identified as those with $S_{500\mu m} >
100$ mJy, uncertainties associated with the modelling of the selection function are expunged.
The combination of these attributes makes submillimeter surveys ideal for the study of strong lens
statistics. We carried out a pilot study of the lensing statistics of submillimetre-selected sources
by making observations with the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) of a sample of strongly-lensed
sources selected from surveys carried out with the Herschel Space Observatory. We attempted to
reproduce the distribution of image separations for the lensed sources using a halo mass function
taken from a numerical simulation which contains both dark matter and baryons. We used three different
density distributions, one based on analytical fits to the halos formed in the EAGLE simulation
and two density distributions (Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) and SISSA) that have been used
before in lensing studies. We found that we could reproduce the observed distribution with all three
density distributions, as long as we imposed an upper mass transition of $\sim$$10^{13} M_{\odot}$
for the SIS and SISSA models, above which we assumed that the density distribution could be represented
by an NFW profile. We show that we would need a sample of $\sim$500 lensed sources to distinguish between
the density distributions, which is practical given the predicted number of lensed sources in the
Herschel surveys.
