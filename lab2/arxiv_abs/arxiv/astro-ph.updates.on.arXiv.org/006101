Debate over the existence of branches in the stellar activity-rotation diagrams continues. Application
of modern time series analysis tools to study the mean cycle periods in chromospheric activity index
is lacking. We develop such models, based on Gaussian processes, for one-dimensional time series
and apply it to the extended Mount Wilson Ca H&K sample. Our main aim is to study how the previously
commonly used assumption of strict harmonicity of the stellar cycles as well as handling of the linear
trends affects the results. We introduce three methods of different complexity, starting with
the simple Bayesian harmonic model and followed by Gaussian Process models with periodic and quasi-periodic
covariance functions. We confirm the existence of two populations in the activity-period diagram.
We find only one significant trend in the inactive population, namely that the cycle periods get
shorter with increasing rotation. This is in contrast with earlier studies, that postulate the
existence of trends in both of the populations. In terms of rotation to cycle period ratio, our data
is consistent with only two activity branches such that the active branch merges together with the
transitional one. The retrieved stellar cycles are uniformly distributed over the R'HK activity
index, indicating that the operation of stellar large-scale dynamos carries smoothly over the
Vaughan-Preston gap. At around the solar activity index, however, indications of a disruption
in the cyclic dynamo action are seen. Our study shows that stellar cycle estimates depend significantly
on the model applied. Such model-dependent aspects include the improper treatment of linear trends,
while the assumption of strict harmonicity can result in the appearance of double cyclicities that
seem more likely to be explained by the quasi-periodicity of the cycles.
