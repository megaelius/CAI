We examine the properties of the host galaxies of $z=7$ quasars using the large volume, cosmological
hydrodynamical simulation BlueTides. We find that the 10 most massive black holes and the 191 quasars
in the simulation (with $M_{\textrm{UV,AGN}}<M_{\textrm{UV,host}}$) are hosted by massive
galaxies with stellar masses $\log(M_\ast/M_\odot)=10.8\pm0.2$, and $10.2\pm0.4$, which have
large star formation rates, of $513\substack{+1225 \\ -351}M_\odot/\rm{yr}$ and $191\substack{+288
\\ -120}M_\odot/\rm{yr}$, respectively. The hosts of the most massive black holes and quasars
in BlueTides are generally bulge-dominated, with bulge-to-total mass ratio $B/T\simeq0.85\pm0.1$,
however their morphologies are not biased relative to the overall $z=7$ galaxy sample. We find that
the hosts of the most massive black holes and quasars are significantly more compact, with half-mass
radii $R_{0.5}=0.41\substack{+0.18 \\ -0.14}$ kpc and $0.40\substack{+0.11 \\ -0.09}$ kpc respectively,
relative to galaxies with similar masses, which have $R_{0.5}=0.71\substack{+0.28 \\ -0.25}$
kpc. We make mock James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) images of these quasars and their host galaxies.
We find that distinguishing the host from the quasar emission will be possible but still challenging
with JWST, due to the small sizes of quasar hosts. We find that quasar samples are biased tracers of
the intrinsic black hole--stellar mass relations, following a relation that is 0.2 dex higher than
that of the full galaxy sample. Finally, we find that the most massive black holes and quasars are
more likely to be found in denser environments than the typical $M_{\textrm{BH}}>10^{6.5}M_\odot$
black hole, indicating that minor mergers at least play some role in growing black holes in the early
Universe.
