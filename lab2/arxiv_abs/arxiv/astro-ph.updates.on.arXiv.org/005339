We perform a three-dimensional triaxial analysis of 16 X-ray regular and 4 high-magnification
galaxy clusters selected from the CLASH survey by combining two-dimensional weak-lensing and
central strong-lensing constraints. In a Bayesian framework, we constrain the intrinsic structure
and geometry of each individual cluster assuming a triaxial Navarro-Frenk-White halo with arbitrary
orientations, characterized by the mass $M_{200\mathrm{c}}$, halo concentration $C_{200\mathrm{c}}$,
and triaxial axis ratios ($q_{\mathrm{a}} \le q_{\mathrm{b}}$), and investigate scaling relations
between these halo structural parameters. From triaxial modeling of the X-ray-selected subsample,
we find that the halo concentration decreases with increasing cluster mass, with a mean concentration
of $C_{200\mathrm{c}} = 4.82\pm0.30$ at the pivot mass $M_{200\mathrm{c}}=10^{15}M_{\odot}h^{-1}$.
This is consistent with the result from spherical modeling, $C_{200\mathrm{c}}=4.51\pm 0.14$.
Independently of the priors, the minor-to-major axis ratio $q_{\mathrm{a}}$ of our full sample
exhibits a clear deviation from the spherical configuration ($q_{\mathrm{a}}=0.52 \pm 0.04$
at $10^{15}M_{\odot}h^{-1}$ with uniform priors), with a weak dependence on the cluster mass.
Combining all 20 clusters, we obtain a joint ensemble constraint on the minor-to-major axis ratio
of $q_{\mathrm{a}}=0.652^{+0.162}_{-0.078}$ and a lower bound on the intermediate-to-major
axis ratio of $q_{\mathrm{b}}>0.63$ at the $2\sigma$ level from an analysis with uniform priors.
Assuming priors on the axis ratios derived from numerical simulations, we constrain the degree
of triaxiality for the full sample to be $\mathcal{T}=0.79 \pm 0.03$ at $10^{15}M_{\odot}h^{-1}$,
indicating a preference for a prolate geometry of cluster halos. We find no statistical evidence
for an orientation bias ($f_{\mathrm{geo}}=0.93 \pm 0.07$) (abridged)
