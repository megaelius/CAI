We present integral field unit (IFU) observations covering the [O III]4959,5007 and H-Beta emission
lines of sixteen z<0.2 type 2 active galactic nuclei (AGN). Our targets are selected from a well-constrained
parent sample of 24,000 AGN so that we can place our observations into the context of the overall AGN
population. Our targets are radio-quiet with star formation rates (<~[10-100] Msol/yr) that
are consistent with normal star-forming galaxies. We decouple the kinematics of galaxy dynamics
and mergers from outflows. We find high-velocity ionised gas (velocity widths of 600-1500 km/s
and maximum velocities of <=1700 km/s) with observed spatial extents of >~(6-16) kpc in all
targets and observe signatures of spherical outflows and bi-polar superbubbles. We show that our
targets are representative of z<0.2, luminous (i.e., L([O III]) > 5x10^41 erg/s) type 2 AGN
and that ionised outflows are not only common but also in >=70% (3 sigma confidence) of cases,
they are extended over kiloparsec scales. Our study demonstrates that galaxy-wide energetic outflows
are not confined to the most extreme star-forming galaxies or radio-luminous AGN; however, there
may be a higher incidence of the most extreme outflow velocities in quasars hosted in ultra-luminous
infrared galaxies. Both star formation and AGN activity appear to be energetically viable to drive
the outflows and we find no definitive evidence that favours one process over the other. Although
highly uncertain, we derive mass outflow rates (typically ~10x the SFRs), kinetic energies (~0.5-10%
of L[AGN]) and momentum rates (typically >~10-20x L[AGN]/c) consistent with theoretical models
that predict AGN-driven outflows play a significant role in shaping the evolution of galaxies.
