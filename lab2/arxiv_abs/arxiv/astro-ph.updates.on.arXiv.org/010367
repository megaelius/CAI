The sub-mm sky is a unique window for probing the architecture of the Universe and structures within
it. From the discovery of dusty sub-mm galaxies, to the ringed nature of protostellar disks, our
understanding of the formation, destruction, and evolution of objects in the Universe requires
a comprehensive view of the sub-mm sky. The current generation single-dish sub-mm facilities have
shown of the potential for discovery, while interferometers have presented a high resolution view
into the finer details. However, our understanding of large-scale structure and our full use of
these interferometers is now hampered by the limited sensitivity of our sub-mm view of the universe
at larger scales. Thus, now is the time to start planning the next generation of sub-mm single dish
facilities, to build on these revolutions in our understanding of the sub-mm sky. Here we present
the case for the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), a concept for a 50m class
single dish telescope. We envision AtLAST as a facility operating as an international partnership
with a suite of instruments to deliver the transformative science described in many Astro2020 science
white papers. A 50m telescope with a high throughput and 1$^\circ$ FoV with a full complement of advanced
instrumentation, including highly multiplexed high-resolution spectrometers, continuum cameras
and Integral Field Units, AtLAST will have mapping speeds thousands of times greater than any current
or planned facility. It will reach confusion limits below $L_*$ in the distant universe and resolve
low-mass protostellar cores at the distance of the Galactic Center, providing synergies with upcoming
facilities across the spectrum. Located on the Atacama plateau, to observe frequencies un-obtainable
by other observatories, AtLAST will enable a fundamentally new understanding of the sub-mm universe
at unprecedented depths.
