In addition to stellar data, Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) also contains accurate astrometry and photometry
of about 14,000 asteroids covering 22 months of observations. We used Gaia asteroid photometry
to reconstruct rotation periods, spin axis directions, and the coarse shapes of a subset of asteroids
with enough observations. One of our aims was to test the reliability of the models with respect to
the number of data points and to check the consistency of these models with independent data. Another
aim was to produce new asteroid models to enlarge the sample of asteroids with known spin and shape.
We used the lightcurve inversion method to scan the period and pole parameter space to create final
shape models that best reproduce the observed data. To search for the sidereal rotation period,
we also used a simpler model of a geometrically scattering triaxial ellipsoid. By processing about
5400 asteroids with at least ten observations in DR2, we derived models for 173 asteroids, 129 of
which are new. Models of the remaining asteroids were already known from the inversion of independent
data, and we used them for verification and error estimation. We also compared the formally best
rotation periods based on Gaia data with those derived from dense lightcurves. We show that a correct
rotation period can be determined even when the number of observations $N$ is less than 20, but the
rate of false solutions is high. For $N > 30$, the solution of the inverse problem is often successful
and the parameters are likely to be correct in most cases. These results are very promising because
the final Gaia catalogue should contain photometry for hundreds of thousands of asteroids, typically
with several tens of data points per object, which should be sufficient for reliable spin reconstruction.
