[abridged] We present the discovery of four surprisingly bright (H_160 ~ 26 - 27 mag AB) galaxy candidates
at z~9-10 in the complete HST CANDELS WFC3/IR GOODS-N imaging data, doubling the number of z~10 galaxy
candidates that are known, just ~500 Myr after the Big Bang. Two similarly bright sources are also
detected in a systematic re-analysis of the GOODS-S data set. Three of the four galaxies in GOODS-N
are significantly detected at 4.5-6.2sigma in the very deep Spitzer/IRAC 4.5 micron data, as is
one of the GOODS-S candidates. Furthermore, the brightest of our candidates (at z=10.2+-0.4) is
robustly detected also at 3.6 micron (6.9sigma), revealing a flat UV spectral energy distribution
with a slope beta=-2.0+-0.2, consistent with demonstrated trends with luminosity at high redshift.
The abundance of such luminous candidates suggests that the luminosity function evolves more significantly
in phi_* than in L_* at z>~8 with a higher number density of bright sources than previously expected.
Despite the discovery of these luminous candidates, the cosmic star formation rate density for
galaxies with SFR >0.7 M_sun/yr shows an order-of-magnitude increase in only 170 Myr from z ~
10 to z ~ 8, consistent with previous results. Based on the IRAC detections, we derive galaxy stellar
masses at z~10, finding that these luminous objects are typically 10^9 M_sun. The cosmic stellar
mass density at z~10 is log10 rho_* = 4.7^+0.5_-0.8 M_sun Mpc^-3 for galaxies brighter than M_UV~-18.
The remarkable brightness, and hence luminosity, of these z~9-10 candidates highlights the opportunity
for deep spectroscopy to determine their redshift and nature, demonstrates the value of additional
search fields covering a wider area to understand star-formation in the very early universe, and
highlights the opportunities for JWST to map the buildup of galaxies at redshifts much earlier than
z~10.
