Planets form in protoplanetary disks and inherit their chemical compositions. It is thus crucial
to map the distribution and investigate the formation of simple organics, such as formaldehyde
and methanol, in protoplanetary disks. We analyze ALMA observations of the nearby disk-jet system
around the T Tauri star DG Tau in the o-H$_2$CO $3_{1,2}-2_{1,1}$ and CH$_3$OH $3_{-2,2}-4_{-1,4}$
E, $5_{0,5}-4_{0,4}$ A transitions at an unprecedented resolution of $\sim0.15"$, i.e., $\sim18$
au at a distance of 121 pc. The H$_2$CO emission originates from a rotating ring extending from $\sim40$
au with a peak at $\sim62$ au, i.e., at the edge of the 1.3mm dust continuum. CH$_3$OH emission is not
detected down to an r.m.s. of 3 mJy/beam in the 0.162 km/s channel. Assuming an ortho-to-para ratio
of 1.8-2.8 the ring- and disk-height-averaged H$_2$CO column density is $\sim0.3-4\times10^{14}$
cm$^{-2}$, while that of CH$_3$OH is $<0.04-0.7\times10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$. In the inner $40$ au
no o-H$_2$CO emission is detected with an upper limit on its beam-averaged column density of $\sim0.5-6\times10^{13}$
cm$^{-2}$. The H$_2$CO ring in the disk of DG Tau is located beyond the CO iceline (R$_{\rm CO}\sim30$
au). This suggests that the H$_2$CO abundance is enhanced in the outer disk due to formation on grain
surfaces by the hydrogenation of CO ice. The emission peak at the edge of the mm dust continuum may
be due to enhanced desorption of H$_2$CO in the gas phase caused by increased UV penetration and/or
temperature inversion. The CH$_3$OH/H$_2$CO abundance ratio is $<1$, in agreement with disk chemistry
models. The inner edge of the H$_2$CO ring coincides with the radius where the polarization of the
dust continuum changes orientation, hinting at a tight link between the H$_2$CO chemistry and the
dust properties in the outer disk and at the possible presence of substructures in the dust distribution.
