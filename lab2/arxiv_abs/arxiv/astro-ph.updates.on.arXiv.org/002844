(abridged) Significant evidence has been gathered suggesting the existence of a main sequence
(MS) of star-forming galaxies that relates their star formation rate and their stellar mass: $SFR
\propto M_*^{\alpha}$. Several ideas have been suggested to explain fundamental properties of
the MS, such as its slope, its dispersion, and its evolution with redshift. However, no consensus
has been reached regarding its true nature, or whether the membership of particular galaxies to
this MS implies the existence of two different modes of star formation. In order to advance our understanding
of the MS, here we use a statistically robust Bayesian Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) analysis
(CHIBURST) to consistently analyze the star-forming properties of a set of hydro-dynamical simulations
of mergers, as well as observations of real mergers and luminous galaxies, both local and at intermediate
redshift. We find a very tight correlation between the specific star formation rate (sSFR) of our
fitted galaxies, and the typical conditions of the star-forming interstellar medium (ISM), parametrized
via a novel quantity: the compactness parameter C, that controls the evolution of dust temperature
with time. The normalization of this correlation is bimodal, and such bi-modality relates to the
membership of individual galaxies to the MS. As mergers move into the coalescence phase, they increase
their compactness and sSFR, creating a scatter in the MS that we measure to be 0.38 dex. The increase
in compactness implies that the physical conditions of the ISM smoothly evolve across the MS. One
possible interpretation for the slope of the log sSFR- log C correlation is that systems with higher
sSFR have smaller physical sizes, whereas the bi-modality between MS objects and outliers suggests
the existence of two different regimes of star formation, with distinct ISM conditions.
