The full two-body problem (F2BP) is often used to model binary asteroid systems, representing the
bodies as two finite mass distributions whose dynamics are influenced by their mutual gravity potential.
The emergent behavior of the F2BP is highly coupled translational and rotational mutual motion
of the mass distributions. A large fraction of characterized binary asteroids appear to be at, or
near, the doubly synchronous equilibrium, which occurs when both bodies are tidally-locked and
in a circular co-orbit. Stable oscillations about this equilibrium can be shown, for the nonplanar
system, to be combinations of seven fundamental frequencies of the system and the mutual orbit rate.
The fundamental frequencies arise as the linear periods of center manifolds identified about the
equilibrium which are heavily influenced by each body's mass parameters. We leverage these eight
dynamical constraints to investigate the observability of binary asteroid mass parameters via
dynamical observations. This is accomplished by deriving a relationship between the fundamental
frequencies and mass parameters for doubly synchronous systems. This relationship allows us to
show the sensitivity of the dynamics to changes in the mass parameters, first for the planar dynamics,
and then for the nonplanar dynamics. In so doing we are able to predict the idealized estimation covariance
of the mass parameters based on observation quality and define idealized observation accuracies
for desired mass parameter certainties. We apply these tools to 617 Patroclus, a doubly synchronous
Trojan binary and flyby target of the LUCY mission, as well as the Pluto and Charon system in order
to predict mutual behavior
