Using a sample of 208 broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from Swift/BAT AGN Spectroscopic
Survey in ultra-hard X-ray band ($14-195$ keV), the hot corona properties are investigated, i.e.
the fraction of gravitational energy dissipated in the hot corona and the hard X-ray photon index.
The bolometric luminosity, \lb, is calculated from host-corrected luminosity at 5100 \AA. Virial
supermassive black hole masses (SMBH, \mbh) are calculated from the $\rm H\beta$ line width and
the corresponding broad line region size-luminosity empirical relation at 5100 \AA. We find a strong
anti-correlation between the fraction of energy released in corona ($F_x \equiv L_{14-195 keV}/L_{\rm
Edd}$) and the Eddington ratio ($ \varepsilon \equiv L_{\rm Bol}/L_{\rm Edd}$), $F_x \propto \varepsilon^{-0.60\pm
0.1}$. It is found that this fraction also has a correlation with the SMBH mass, $F_x \propto \varepsilon^{-0.74\pm
0.14} M_{\rm BH}^{-0.30\pm 0.03}$. Assuming that magnetic buoyancy and feild reconnection lead
to the formation of a hot corona, our result favours the shear stress tensor being a proportion of
the gas pressure. For our entire sample, it is found that the hard X-ray photon index $\Gamma$ has
a weak but significant correlation with the Eddington ratio, $ \Gamma=2.17+0.21\log \varepsilon$.
However, this correlation is not robust because the relation is not statistically significant
for its subsample of 32 RM AGNs with relatively reliable $M_{\rm BH}$ or its subsample of 166 AGNs
with single-epoch $M_{\rm BH}$. We do not find a statistically significant relation between the
photon index and the Eddington ratio taking into account an additional dependence on $F_x$.
