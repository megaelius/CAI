This is the first paper in a series devoted to systematic study of the size and structure of the broad-line
region (BLR) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using reverberation mapping (RM) data. We employ
a recently developed Bayesian approach that statistically describes the variabibility as a damped
random walk process and delineates the BLR structure using a flexible disk geometry that can account
for a variety of shapes, including disks, rings, shells, and spheres. We allow for the possibility
that the line emission may respond non-linearly to the continuum, and we detrend the light curves
when there is clear evidence for secular variation. We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo implementation
based on Bayesian statistics to recover the parameters and uncertainties for the BLR model. The
corresponding transfer function is obtained self-consistently. We tentatively constrain the
virial factor used to estimate black hole masses; more accurate determinations will have to await
velocity-resolved RM data. Application of our method to RM data with Hbeta monitoring for about
40 objects shows that the assumed BLR geometry can reproduce quite well the observed emission-line
fluxes from the continuum light curves. We find that the Hbeta BLR sizes obtained from our method
are on average ~20% larger than those derived from the traditional cross-correlation method. Nevertheless,
we still find a tight BLR size-luminosity relation with a slope of alpha=0.55\pm0.03 and an intrinsic
scatter of ~0.18 dex. In particular, we demonstrate that our approach yields appropriate BLR sizes
for some objects (such as Mrk 142 and PG 2130+099) where traditional methods previously encountered
difficulties.
