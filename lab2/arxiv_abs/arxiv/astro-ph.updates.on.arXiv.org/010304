Statistical parameters are used in finance, weather, industrial, science, among other vast number
of different fields to draw conclusions. New more efficient selection methods are mandatory to
analyses the huge amount of astronomical data. The standard and new data-mining parameters to analyses
non-correlated data are used to set the best way to discriminate stochastic and non-stochastic
variations. We introduce 16 modified statistical parameters covering different features of statistical
distribution, like; average, dispersion, and shape parameters. Many of dispersion and shape parameters
are unbound parameters, i.e. equations which do not require the calculation of the average. Moreover,
the majority of them have lower error than previous ones that is mainly observed for distributions
having few measurements. A set of non-correlated variability indices, sample size corrections,
and a new noise model as well as tests of different apertures and cutoffs on the data (BAS approach)
are introduced. The number of misselections is reduced by about 520% using a single waveband and
1200% combining all wavebands. On the other hand, the even mean also improves the correlated indices
introduced in Paper 1 Ferreira Lopes & Cross (2016). The misselection rate is reduced by about 18%
if the even mean is used instead of the mean to compute the correlated indices in the WFCAM database.
Even statistics allows us to improve the effectiveness of both correlated and non-correlated indices.
The correlated variability indices, proposed in the first paper of this series, are also improved
if the even mean is used. The even parameters will also be useful for classifying light curves in the
last step of this project. We consider that the first step of this project, where we set new techniques
and methods that provide a huge improve on the efficiency of selection of variable stars, is now complete.
