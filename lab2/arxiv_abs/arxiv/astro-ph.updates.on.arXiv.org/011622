When modelling stars with masses larger than 1.2Msun with no observed chemical peculiarity, atomic
diffusion is often neglected because, on its own, it causes unrealistic surface abundances compared
with those observed. The reality is that atomic diffusion is in competition with other transport
processes. The purpose of this study is to quantify the opposite or conjugated effects of atomic
diffusion and rotationally induced mixing in stellar models of low mass stars. Our second goal is
to estimate the impact of neglecting both rotational mixing and atomic diffusion in stellar parameter
inferences for stars with masses larger than 1.3Msun. Using the AIMS code, we infer the masses and
ages of a set of representative artificial stars for which models were computed with the CESTAM evolution
code, taking into account rotationally induced mixing and atomic diffusion, including radiative
accelerations. We show that for masses lower than 1.3Msun, rotation dominates the transport of
chemical elements, and strongly reduces the effect of atomic diffusion, with net surface abundance
modifications similar to solar ones. At larger mass, atomic diffusion and rotation are competing
equally. Above 1.44Msun, atomic diffusion dominates in stellar models with initial rotation smaller
than 80km.s-1 producing a chemical peculiarity which is not observed in Kepler-legacy stars. This
indicates that a transport process of chemical elements is missing. Importantly, neglecting rotation
and atomic diffusion (including radiative accelerations) in the models, when inferring the parameters
of F-type stars, may lead to errors of 5%, 2.5% and 25% respectively for stellar masses, radii and
ages. Atomic diffusion (including radiative accelerations) and rotational mixing should be taken
into account in stellar models in order to determine accurate stellar parameters.
