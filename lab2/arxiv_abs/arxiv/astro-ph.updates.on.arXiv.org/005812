The KESPRINT consortium identified K2-216 as a planetary candidate host star in the K2 space mission
Campaign 8 field with a transiting super-Earth. The planet was also recently validated by Mayo et
al. 2018. Our aim was to confirm the detection and to derive the main physical characteristics of
K2-216b, including the mass. We performed a series of follow-up observations: high resolution
imaging with the FastCam camera at the TCS, the Infrared Camera and Spectrograph at Subaru, and high
resolution spectroscopy with HARPS (ESO, La Silla), HARPS-N (TNG) and FIES (NOT). The stellar spectra
were analysed with the SpecMatch-Emp and SME codes to derive the stellar fundamental properties.
We analysed the K2 light curve with the Pyaneti software. The radial-velocity measurements were
modelled with both a Gaussian process regression and the floating chunk offset technique to simultaneously
model the planetary signal and the correlated noise associated with stellar activity. Imaging
confirms that K2-216 is a single star. Our analysis discloses that the star is a moderately active
K5V star of mass 0.70+/-0.03 Msun and radius 0.72+/-0.05 Rsun. Planet b is found to have a radius of
1.8+0.2-0.1 Rearth and a 2.17 day orbit. These values are in agreement with those of Mayo et al. 2018.
We find consistent results for the planet mass from both models: 7.4+/-2.2 Mearth from the Gaussian
process regression, and 7.9+/-1.6 Mearth from the floating chunk offset technique which implies
that this planet is a super-Earth. The planet parameters put planet b in the middle of, or just below,
the gap of the radius distribution of small planets. The density is consistent with a rocky composition
of primarily iron and magnesium silicate. In agreement with theoretical predictions, we find that
the planet is a remnant core, stripped of its atmosphere, and is one of the largest planets found that
have lost its atmosphere.
