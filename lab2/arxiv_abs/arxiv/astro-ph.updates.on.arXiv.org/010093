Protoplanets and circumplanetary disks are rather elusive in their thermal IR emission. Yet they
are cornerstone to the most popular interpretations for the protoplanetary disks structures observed
in the gas and dust density fields, even though alternative theories exist. The gaseous velocity
field should also bear the imprint of planet-disk interactions, with non-Keplerian fine structure
in the molecular line channels maps. Such wiggles are expected on global scales in the disk, and are
affected by the optical depth structure and synthesis imaging limitations, but their detail could
in principle be connected to the perturber by comparison with hydrodynamical simulations. These
predictions may have been confirmed in HD163296, where the most conspicuous wiggles are interpreted
in terms of an embedded planet. The velocity centroid maps may allow for more robust indirect detections
of embedded planets. The non-Keplerian velocity along the planetary wakes undergoes an abrupt
sign reversals across the protoplanet. After subtraction of the disk rotation curve, the location
of the perturber should be identifiable as a Doppler-flip in molecular line velocity centroid maps.
Here we improve our rotation curves in an extension to disks with intermediate inclinations, which
we apply to deep and fine angular resolution CO isotopologue datasets. Trials in HD97048 and in HD16396
yield non-detections. However, in HD100546 we pick-up a conspicuous Doppler-flip. Its coincidence
with the continuum ring suggests vertical and radial velocity flows as around an airfoil, and may
require fast migration if due to planet-disk interactions.
