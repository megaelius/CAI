The MeerKAT telescope represents an outstanding opportunity for radio pulsar timing science with
its unique combination of a large collecting area and aperture efficiency (effective area $\sim$7500
m$^2$), system temperature ($T<20$K), high slew speeds (1-2 deg/s), large bandwidths (770 MHz
at 20cm wavelengths), southern hemisphere location (latitude $\sim -30^\circ$) and ability to
form up to four sub-arrays. The MeerTime project is a five-year program on the MeerKAT array by an
international consortium that will regularly time over 1000 radio pulsars to perform tests of relativistic
gravity, search for the gravitational wave signature induced by supermassive black hole binaries
in the timing residuals of millisecond pulsars, explore the interiors of neutron stars through
a pulsar glitch monitoring programme, explore the origin and evolution of binary pulsars, monitor
the swarms of pulsars that inhabit globular clusters and monitor radio magnetars. In addition to
these primary programmes, over 1000 pulsars will have their arrival times monitored and the data
made immediately public. The MeerTime pulsar backend comprises two server-class machines each
of which possess four Graphics Processing Units. Up to four pulsars can be coherently dedispersed
simultaneously up to dispersion measures of over 1000 pc cm$^{-3}$. All data will be provided in
psrfits format. The MeerTime backend will be capable of producing coherently dedispersed filterbank
data for timing multiple pulsars in the cores of globular clusters that is useful for pulsar searches
of tied array beams. All MeerTime data will ultimately be made available for public use, and any published
results will include the arrival times and profiles used in the results.
