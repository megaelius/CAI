We present a comparative study between the results of most hydrodynamic simulations of the common
envelope binary interaction to date and observations of post common envelope binaries. The goal
is to evaluate whether this dataset indicates the existence of a formula that may predict final separations
of post-common envelope systems as a function of pre-common envelope parameters. Some of our conclusions
are not surprising while others are more subtle. We find that: (i) Values of the final orbital separation
derived from common envelope simulations must at this time be considered upper limits. Simulations
that include recombination energy do not seem to have systematically different final separations;
these and other simulations imply $\alpha_{\rm CE} < 0.6-1.0$. At least one simulation, {applicable
to double-degenerate systems}, implies $\alpha_{\rm CE} < 0.2$. (ii) Despite large reconstruction
errors, the post-RGB observations reconstructed parameters are in agreement with some of the simulations.
The post-AGB observations behave instead as if they had a systematically lower value of $\alpha_{\rm
CE}$. The lack of common envelope simulations with low mass AGB stars leaves us with no insight as
to why this is the case. (iii) The smallest mass companion that survives the common envelope with
intermediate mass giants is 0.05-0.1~\ms. (iv) Observations of binaries with separations larger
than $\sim$10~\rs, tend to have high $M_2/M_1$ mass ratios and may go through a relatively long phase
of unstable Roche lobe mass transfer followed by a weakened common envelope (or with no common envelope
at all). (v) The effect of the spatial resolution and of the softening length on simulation results
remains poorly quantified.
