Extensive surveys with the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) over the past decade, targeting
some of the most massive clusters in the sky, have uncovered dozens of galaxy-cluster strong lenses.
The massive cluster strong-lens scale is typically $\theta_{E}\sim10\arcsec$ to $\sim30-35\arcsec$,
with only a handful of clusters known with Einstein radii $\theta_{E}\sim40\arcsec$ or above (for
$z_{source}=2$, nominally). Here we report another very large cluster lens, RXC J0032.1+1808
($z=0.3956$), the second richest cluster in the redMapper cluster catalog and the 85th most massive
cluster in the Planck Sunyaev-Zel'dovich catalog. With our Light-Traces-Mass and fully parametric
(dPIEeNFW) approaches, we construct strong lensing models based on 18 multiple images of 5 background
galaxies newly identified in the \textit{Hubble} data mainly from the \textit{Reionization Lensing
Cluster Survey} (RELICS), in addition to a known sextuply imaged system in this cluster. Furthermore,
we compare these models to Lenstool and GLAFIC models that were produced independently as part of
the RELICS program. All models reveal a large effective Einstein radius of $\theta_{E}\simeq40\arcsec$
($z_{source}=2$), owing to the obvious concentration of substructures near the cluster center.
Although RXC J0032.1+1808 has a very large critical area and high lensing strength, only three magnified
high-redshift candidates are found within the field targeted by RELICS. Nevertheless, we expect
many more high-redshift candidates will be seen in wider and deeper observations with \textit{Hubble}
or \emph{JWST}. Finally, the comparison between several algorithms demonstrates that the total
error budget is largely dominated by systematic uncertainties.
