From the approximately $\sim$3,500 planetary nebulae (PNe) discovered in our Galaxy, only 14 are
known to be members of the Galactic halo. Nevertheless, a systematic search for halo PNe has never
been performed. In this study, we present new photometric diagnostic tools to identify compact
PNe in the Galactic halo by making use of the novel 12-filter system projects, J-PLUS (Javalambre
Photometric Local Universe Survey) and S-PLUS (Southern-Photometric Local Universe Survey).
We reconstructed the IPHAS (Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) Photometric H${\alpha}$ Survey of the
Northern Galactic Plane) diagnostic diagram and propose four new ones using i) the J-PLUS and S-PLUS
synthetic photometry for a grid of photo-ionisation models of halo PNe, ii) several observed halo
PNe, as well as iii) a number of other emission-line objects that resemble PNe. All colour-colour
diagnostic diagrams are validated using two known halo PNe observed by J-PLUS during the scientific
verification phase and the first data release (DR1) of S-PLUS and the DR1 of J-PLUS. By applying our
criteria to the DR1s ($\sim$1,190 deg$^2$), we identified one PN candidate. However, optical follow-up
spectroscopy proved it to be a H II region belonging to the UGC 5272 galaxy. Here, we also discuss the
PN and two H II galaxies recovered by these selection criteria. Finally, the cross-matching with
the most updated PNe catalogue (HASH) helped us to highlight the potential of these surveys, since
we recover all the known PNe in the observed area. The tools here proposed to identify PNe and separate
them from their emission-line contaminants proved to be very efficient thanks to the combination
of many colours, even when applied -like in the present work- to an automatic photometric search
that is limited to compact PNe.
