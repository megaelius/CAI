We present high resolution millimeter continuum ALMA observations of the disks around the T Tauri
stars LkCa 15 and J1610. These disks host dust-depleted inner regions, possibly carved by massive
planets, and are of prime interest to study the imprints of planet-disk interactions. While at moderate
angular resolution they appear as a broad ring surrounding a cavity, the continuum emission resolves
into multiple rings at a resolution of ~60$\times$40 mas (~7.5 au for LkCa 15, ~6 au for J1610) and
~$7\,\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ rms at 1.3 mm. In addition to a broad extended component, LkCa 15 and J1610
host 3 and 2 narrow rings, respectively, with two bright rings in LkCa 15 being radially resolved.
The rings look marginally optically thick, with peak optical depths of ~0.5 (neglecting scattering),
in agreement with high angular resolution observations of full disks. We perform hydrodynamical
simulations with an embedded, sub-Jovian-mass planet and show that the observed multi-ringed
substructure can be qualitatively explained as the outcome of the planet-disk interaction. We
note however that the choice of the disk cooling timescale alone can significantly impact the resulting
gas and dust distributions around the planet, leading to different numbers of rings and gaps and
different spacings between them. We propose that the massive outer disk regions of transition disks
are favorable places for planetesimals and possibly second generation planet formation of objects
with a lower mass than the planets carving the inner cavity (typically few $M_{\rm Jup}$), and that
the annular substructures observed in LkCa 15 and J1610 may be indicative of planetary core formation
within dust-rich pressure traps. Current observations are compatible with other mechanisms being
at the origin of the observed substructures, in particular with narrow rings generated at the edge
of the CO and N$_2$ snowlines.
