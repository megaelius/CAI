We compute the concentrations of five transition elements (Cr, Fe, Co, Ni and Zn) in supernova presolar
grains (Silicon Carbide Type X) from the time they condense till the end of free expansion phase,
via condensation and implantation. We consider relative velocities of these elements with respect
to grains as they condense and evolve at temperatures $\le$ 2000 K, use zonal nucleosynthesis yields
for three core collapse supernovae models - 15 M\textsubscript{\(\odot\)}, 20 M\textsubscript{\(\odot\)}
and 25 M\textsubscript{\(\odot\)} and an ion target simulator SDTrimSP to model their implantation
onto the grains. Simulations from SDTrimSP show that maximal implantation in the core of the grain
is possible, contrary to previous studies. We find that the 15 M\textsubscript{\(\odot\)} model
best explains the measured concentrations of SiC X grains obtained from Murchison meteorite. For
grains which contained $\ge$ 300 ppm of Fe and Ni, we find implantation fraction to be $\le$ 0.25 for
most probable differential zonal velocities in this phase which implies that condensation is dominant
than implantation unless the grain did not spend much time in the supernova environment. We show
that radioactive corrections and mixing from the innermost zones is vital to explaining the excess
Ni (condensed as well as implanted) obtained in laboratory measurements. This mixing also explains
the relative abundances of Co and Ni with respect to Fe simultaneously. The model developed can be
used to predict concentrations of all other elements in various presolar grains condensed in supernova
ejecta and matched against measured concentrations in grains found in meteorites.
