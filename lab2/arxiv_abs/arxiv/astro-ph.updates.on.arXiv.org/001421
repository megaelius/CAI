Understanding the diversity in spectra is the key to determining the physical parameters of galaxies.
The optical spectra of galaxies are highly convoluted with continuum and lines which are potentially
sensitive to different physical parameters. Defining the wavelength regions of interest is therefore
an important question. In this work, we identify informative wavelength regions in a single-burst
stellar populations model by using the CUR Matrix Decomposition. Simulating the Lick/IDS spectrograph
configuration, we recover the widely used Dn(4000), Hbeta, and HdeltaA to be most informative.
Simulating the SDSS spectrograph configuration with a wavelength range 3450-8350 Angstrom and
a model-limited spectral resolution of 3 Angstrom, the most informative regions are: first region-the
4000 Angstrom break and the Hdelta line; second region-the Fe-like indices; third region-the Hbeta
line; fourth region-the G band and the Hgamma line. A Principal Component Analysis on the first region
shows that the first eigenspectrum tells primarily the stellar age, the second eigenspectrum is
related to the age-metallicity degeneracy, and the third eigenspectrum shows an anti-correlation
between the strengths of the Balmer and the Ca K and H absorptions. The regions can be used to determine
the stellar age and metallicity in early-type galaxies which have solar abundance ratios, no dust,
and a single-burst star formation history. The region identification method can be applied to any
set of spectra of the user's interest, so that we eliminate the need for a common, fixed-resolution
index system. We discuss future directions in extending the current analysis to late-type galaxies.
