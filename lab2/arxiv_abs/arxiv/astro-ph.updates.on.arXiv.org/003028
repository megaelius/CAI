The Zone of Avoidance (ZOA), whose emptiness is an artifact of our Galaxy dust, has been challenging
observers as well as theorists for many years. Multiple attempts have been made on the observational
side to map this region in order to better understand the local flows. On the theoretical side, however,
this region is often simply statistically populated with structures but no real attempt has been
made to confront theoretical and observed matter distributions. This paper takes a step forward
using constrained realizations of the local Universe shown to be perfect substitutes of local Universe-like
simulations for smoothed high density peak studies. Far from generating completely `random' structures
in the ZOA, the reconstruction technique arranges matter according to the surrounding environment
of this region. More precisely, the mean distributions of structures in a series of constrained
and random realizations differ: while densities annihilate each other when averaging over 200
random realizations, structures persist when summing 200 constrained realizations. The probability
distribution function of ZOA grid cells to be highly overdense is a Gaussian with a 15% mean in the
random case, while that of the constrained case exhibits large tails. This implies that areas with
the largest probabilities host most likely a structure. Comparisons between these predictions
and observations, like those of the Puppis 3 cluster, show a remarkable agreement and allow us to
assert the presence of the, recently highlighted by observations, Vela supercluster at about 180
Mpc/h, right behind the thickest dust layers of our Galaxy.
