The Jeans analysis is often used to infer the total density of a system by relating the velocity moments
of an observable tracer population to the underlying gravitational potential. This technique
has recently been applied in the search for Dark Matter in objects such as dwarf spheroidal galaxies
where the presence of Dark Matter is inferred via stellar velocities. A precise account of the density
is needed to constrain the expected gamma ray flux from DM self-annihilation and to distinguish
between cold and warm dark matter models. Unfortunately the traditional method of fitting the second
order Jeans equation to the tracer dispersion suffers from an unbreakable degeneracy of solutions
due to the unknown velocity anisotropy of the projected system. To tackle this degeneracy one can
appeal to higher moments of the Jeans equation. By introducing an analog to the Binney anisotropy
parameter at fourth order, beta' we create a framework that encompasses all solutions to the fourth
order Jeans equations rather than those in the literature that impose unnecessary correlations
between anisotropy of second and fourth order moments. The condition beta' = f(beta) ensures that
the degeneracy is lifted and we interpret the separable augmented density system as the order-independent
case beta'= beta. For a generic choice of beta' we present the line of sight projection of the fourth
moment and how it could be incorporated into a joint likelihood analysis of the dispersion and kurtosis.
Having presented the mathematical framework, we then use it to develop a statistical method for
the purpose of placing constraints on dark matter density parameters from discrete velocity data.
The method is tested on simulated dwarf spheroidal data sets leading to results which motivate study
of real dwarf spheroidal data sets.
