Simple molecules like H2CO and CH3OH in protoplanetary disks are the starting point for the production
of more complex organic molecules. So far, the observed chemical complexity in disks has been limited
due to freeze out of molecules onto grains in the bulk of the cold outer disk. Complex molecules can
be studied more directly in transitional disks with large inner holes, as these have a higher potential
of detection, through UV heating of the outer disk and the directly exposed midplane at the wall.
We use Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 9 (~680 GHz) line data of the transitional
disk Oph IRS 48, previously shown to have a large dust trap, to search for complex molecules in regions
where planetesimals are forming. We report the detection of the H2CO 9(1,8)-8(1,7) line at 674 GHz,
which is spatially resolved as a semi-ring at ~60 AU radius centered south from the star. The inferred
H2CO abundance is ~10^{-8} derived by combining a physical disk model of the source with a non-LTE
excitation calculation. Upper limits for CH3OH lines in the same disk give an abundance ratio H2CO/CH3OH>0.3,
which points to both ice formation and gas-phase routes playing a role in the H2CO production. Upper
limits on the abundances of H13CO+, CN and several other molecules in the disk are also derived and
found to be consistent with full chemical models. The detection of the H2CO line demonstrates the
start of complex organic molecules in a planet-forming disk. Future ALMA observations should be
able to push down the abundance detection limits of other molecules by 1-2 orders of magnitude and
test chemical models of organic molecules in (transitional) disks.
