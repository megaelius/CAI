We quantify the atmospheric mass loss during planet formation by examining the contributions to
atmospheric loss from both giant impacts and planetesimal accretion. Giant impacts cause global
motion of the ground. Using analytic self-similar solutions and full numerical integrations we
find (for isothermal atmospheres with adiabatic index ($\gamma=5/3$) that the local atmospheric
mass loss fraction for ground velocities $v_g < 0.25 v_{esc}$ is given by $\chi_{loss}=(1.71
v_g/v_{esc})^{4.9}$, where $v_{esc}$ is the escape velocity from the target. Yet, the global atmospheric
mass loss is a weaker function of the impactor velocity $v_{Imp}$ and mass $m_{Imp}$ and given by
$X_{loss} ~ 0.4x+1.4x^2-0.8x^3$ (isothermal atmosphere) and $X_{loss} ~ 0.4x+1.8x^2-1.2x^3$
(adiabatic atmosphere), where $x=(v_{Imp}m/v_{esc}M)$. Atmospheric mass loss due to planetesimal
impacts proceeds in two different regimes: 1) Large enough impactors $m > \sqrt{2} \rho_0 (\pi
h R)^{3/2}$ (25~km for the current Earth), are able to eject all the atmosphere above the tangent
plane of the impact site, which is $h/2R$ of the whole atmosphere, where $h$, $R$ and $\rho_0$ are
the atmospheric scale height, radius of the target, and its atmospheric density at the ground. 2)
Smaller impactors, but above $m>4 \pi \rho_0 h^3$ (1~km for the current Earth) are only able to
eject a fraction of the atmospheric mass above the tangent plane. We find that the most efficient
impactors (per unit impactor mass) for atmospheric loss are planetesimals just above that lower
limit and that the current atmosphere of the Earth could have resulted from an equilibrium between
atmospheric erosion and volatile delivery to the atmosphere from planetesimals. We conclude that
planetesimal impacts are likely to have played a major role in atmospheric mass loss over the formation
history of the terrestrial planets. (Abridged)
