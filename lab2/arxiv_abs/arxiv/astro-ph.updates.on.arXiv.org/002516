We analyzed data in polarized intensity obtained with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at twelve
epochs (one observation per month from January to December 2011) at 15, 24, and 43 GHz. For the absolute
orientation of the electric vector position angles (EVPA) we used the D-terms method. We also used
gamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope on weekly time bins throughout 2011. The source
shows polarized emission, and its properties vary with time, frequency, and location along the
jet. The core mean polarization fraction is generally between 1% and 2%, with a 4% peak at 43 GHz in
March; the polarization angle is variable, mainly at 15 GHz, where it changes frequently, and less
so at 43 GHz, where it oscillates in the range 114 - 173 deg. The jet polarization properties are more
stable, with a fractional polarization of around 16% and a polarization angle nearly perpendicular
to the jet axis. The average flux and photon index at gamma-ray energies are (17.7+-0.5)x10^8 ph
cm^-2 s^-1 and the photon index is 1.77+-0.02. The gamma-ray light curve shows variability, with
a main peak that appears to be associated with the peak in the core polarized emission at 43 GHz, as
well as with the total intensity light curve. A discrete correlation function analysis yields a
correlation coefficient of 0.54 at zero delay, with a significance level above 99.7%. We accurately
determine the polarization properties of Mrk 421, both in the core and in the jet region. The radio
and gamma-ray light curves are correlated. The observed EVPA variability at 15 GHz is partly due
to opacity and partly to a variable Faraday rotation effect. To explain the residual variability
of the intrinsic polarization angle and the low degree of polarization in the core region, we invoke
a blend of variable cross-polarized subcomponents with different polarization properties within
the beam.
