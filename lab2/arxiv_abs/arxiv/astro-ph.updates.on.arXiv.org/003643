We analyse the circular polarisation data accumulated in the first 7 years of the POLAMI project
introduced in an accompanying paper (Agudo et al.). In the 3mm wavelength band, we acquired more
than 2600 observations, and all but one of our 37 sample sources were detected, most of them several
times. For most sources, the observed distribution of the degree of circular polarisation is broader
than that of unpolarised calibrators, indicating that weak (<0.5%) circular polarisation is present
most of the time. Our detection rate and the maximum degree of polarisation found, 2.0%, are comparable
to previous surveys, all made at much longer wavelengths. We argue that the process generating circular
polarisation must not be strongly wavelength dependent, and we propose that the widespread presence
of circular polarisation in our short wavelength sample dominated by blazars is mostly due to Faraday
conversion of the linearly polarised synchrotron radiation in the helical magnetic field of the
jet. Circular polarisation is variable, most notably on time scales comparable to or shorter than
our median sampling interval <1 month. Longer time scales of about one year are occasionally detected,
but severely limited by the weakness of the signal. At variance with some longer wavelength investigations
we find that the sign of circular polarisation changes in most sources, while only 7 sources, including
3 already known, have a strong preference for one sign. The degrees of circular and linear polarisation
do not show any systematic correlation. We do find however one particular event where the two polarisation
degrees vary in synchronism during a time span of 0.9 years. The paper also describes a novel method
for calibrating the sign of circular polarisation observations.
