We present a mock stellar catalog, matching in volume, depth and data model the content of the planned
Gaia early data release 3 (Gaia EDR3). We have generated our catalog (GeDR3mock) using galaxia,
a tool to sample stars from an underlying Milky Way (MW) model or from N-body data. We used an updated
Besan\c{c}on Galactic model together with the latest PARSEC stellar evolutionary tracks, now
also including white dwarfs. We added the Magellanic clouds and realistic open clusters with internal
rotation. We empirically modelled uncertainties based on Gaia DR2 (GDR2) and scaled them according
to the longer baseline in Gaia EDR3. The apparent magnitudes were reddened according to a new selection
of 3D extinction maps. To help with the Gaia selection function we provide all-sky magnitude limit
maps in G and BP for a few relevant GDR2 subsets together with the routines to produce these maps for
user-defined subsets. We supplement the catalog with photometry and extinctions in non-Gaia bands.
The catalog is available in the Virtual Observatory and can be queried just like the actual Gaia EDR3
will be. We highlight a few capabilities of the Astronomy Data Query Language (ADQL) with educative
catalog queries. We use the data extracted from those queries to compare GeDR3mock to GDR2, which
emphasises the importance of adding observational noise to the mock data. Since the underlying
truth, e.g. stellar parameters, is know in GeDR3mock, it can be used to construct priors as well as
mock data tests for parameter estimation. All code, models and data used to produce GeDR3mock are
linked and contained in galaxia_wrap, a python package, representing a fast galactic forward model,
able to project MW models and N-body data into realistic Gaia observables.
