We present results from seventy-one zoom simulations of a Milky Way-sized (MW) halo, exploring
the parameter space for a widely-used star formation and feedback model in the {\tt Enzo} simulation
code. We propose a novel way to match observations, using functional fits to the observed baryon
makeup over a wide range of halo masses. The model MW galaxy is calibrated using three parameters:
the star formation efficiency $\left(f_*\right)$, the efficiency of thermal energy from stellar
feedback $\left(\epsilon\right)$ and the region into which feedback is injected $\left(r\ {\rm
and}\ s\right)$. We find that changing the amount of feedback energy affects the baryon content
most significantly. We then identify two sets of feedback parameter values that are both able to
reproduce the baryonic properties for haloes between $10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $10^{12}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$.
We can potentially improve the agreement by incorporating more parameters or physics. If we choose
to focus on one property at a time, we can obtain a more realistic halo baryon makeup. We show that the
employed feedback prescription is insensitive to dark matter mass resolution between $10^5\,{\rm
M_\odot}$ and $10^7\,{\rm M_\odot}$. Contrasting both star formation criteria and the corresponding
combination of optimal feedback parameters, we also highlight that feedback is self-consistent:
to match the same baryonic properties, with a relatively higher gas to stars conversion efficiency,
the feedback strength required is lower, and vice versa. Lastly, we demonstrate that chaotic variance
in the code can cause deviations of approximately 10\% and 25\% in the stellar and baryon mass in simulations
evolved from identical initial conditions.
