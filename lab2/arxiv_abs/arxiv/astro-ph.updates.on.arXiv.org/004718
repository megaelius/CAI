In this letter a near-infrared integral field study of a proto-brown dwarf candidate is presented.
A $\sim$ 0\farcs5 blue-shifted outflow is detected in both H$_{2}$ and [Fe II] lines at V$_{sys}$
= (-35~$\pm$ 2)~km~s$^{-1}$ and V$_{sys}$ = (-51~$\pm$ 5)~km~s$^{-1}$ respectively. In addition,
slower ($\sim$ $\pm$~10~km~s$^{-1}$) H$_{2}$ emission is detected out to $<$ 5\farcs4, in the
direction of both the blue and red-shifted outflow lobes but along a different position angle to
the more compact faster emission. It is argued that the more compact emission is a jet and the extended
H$_{2}$ emission is tracing a cavity. The source extinction is estimated at A$_{v}$ = 18 mag $\pm$
1 mag and the outflow extinction at Av = 9 mag $\pm$ 0.4 mag. The H$_{2}$ outflow temperature is calculated
to be 1422 K $\pm$~255~K and the electron density of the [Fe II] outflow is measured at $\sim$ 10000
cm$^{-3}$. Furthermore, the mass outflow rate is estimated at $\dot{M}_{out[H2]}$ = 3.8 $\times$
10$^{-10}$~\Msun~yr$^{-1}$ and $\dot{M}_{out[FeII]}$ = 1 $\times$ 10$^{-8}$~\Msun~yr$^{-1}$.
$\dot{M}_{out[FeII]}$ takes a Fe depletion of $\sim$ 88$\%$ into account. The depletion is investigated
using the ratio of the [FeII]~1.257~$\mu$m and [PII]~1.188~$\mu$m lines. Using the Pa$\beta$
and Br$\gamma$ lines and a range in stellar mass and radius $\dot{M}_{acc}$ is calculated to be (3
- 10) $\times$ 10$^{-8}$~\Msun~yr$^{-1}$. Comparing these rates puts the jet efficiency in line
with predictions of magneto-centrifugal models of jet launching in low mass protostars. This is
a further case of a brown dwarf outflow exhibiting analogous properties to protostellar jets.
