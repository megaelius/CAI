A large body of work based on collisionless cosmological N-body simulations going back over two
decades has advanced the idea that collapsed dark matter haloes have simple and approximately universal
forms for their mass density and pseudo-phase space density (PPSD) distributions. However, a general
consensus on the physical origin of these results has not yet been reached. In the present study,
we explore to what extent the apparent universality of these forms holds when we vary the initial
conditions (i.e., the primordial power spectrum of density fluctuations) away from the standard
CMB-normalised case, but still within the context of LCDM with a fixed expansion history. Using
simulations that vary the initial amplitude and shape, we show that the structure of dark matter
haloes retains a clear memory of the initial conditions. Specifically, increasing (lowering)
the amplitude of fluctuations increases (decreases) the concentration of haloes and, if pushed
far enough, the density profiles deviate strongly from the NFW form that is a good approximation
for the CMB-normalised case. Although, an Einasto form works well. Rather than being universal,
the slope of the PPSD (or pseudo-entropy) profile steepens (flattens) with increasing (decreasing)
power spectrum amplitude and can exhibit a strong halo mass dependence. Our results therefore indicate
that the previously identified universality of the structure of dark matter haloes is mostly a consequence
of adopting a narrow range of (CMB-normalised) initial conditions for the simulations. Our new
suite provides a useful test-bench against which physical models for the origin of halo structure
can be validated.
