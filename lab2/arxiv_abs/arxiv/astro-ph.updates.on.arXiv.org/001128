Stellar magnetic field measurements obtained from spectropolarimetry offer key data for activity
and dynamo studies, and we present the results of a major high-resolution spectropolarimetric
Bcool project magnetic snapshot survey of 170 solar-type stars from observations with the Telescope
Bernard Lyot and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. For each target star a high signal-to-noise
circularly polarised Stokes V profile has been obtained using Least-Squares Deconvolution, and
used to detect surface magnetic fields and measure the corresponding mean surface longitudinal
magnetic field ($B_{l}$). Chromospheric activity indicators were also measured. Surface magnetic
fields were detected for 67 stars, with 21 of these stars classified as mature solar-type stars,
a result that increases by a factor of four the number of mature solar-type stars on which magnetic
fields have been observed. In addition, a magnetic field was detected for 3 out of 18 of the subgiant
stars surveyed. For the population of K-dwarfs the mean value of $B_{l}$ ($|B_{l}|_{mean}$) was
also found to be higher (5.7 G) than $|B_{l}|_{mean}$ measured for the G-dwarfs (3.2 G) and the F-dwarfs
(3.3 G). For the sample as a whole $|B_{l}|_{mean}$ increases with rotation rate and decreases with
age, and the upper envelope for $|B_{l}|$ correlates well with the observed chromospheric emission.
Stars with a chromospheric S-index greater than about 0.2 show a high magnetic field detection rate
and so offer optimal targets for future studies. This survey constitutes the most extensive spectropolarimetric
survey of cool stars undertaken to date, and suggests that it is feasible to pursue magnetic mapping
of a wide range of moderately active solar-type stars to improve understanding of their surface
fields and dynamos.
