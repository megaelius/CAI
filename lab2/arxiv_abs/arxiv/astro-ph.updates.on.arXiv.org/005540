We cross-match objects from several different astronomical catalogs to determine the absolute
proper proper motions of stars within the 30-arcmin radius fields of 115 Milky-Way globular clusters
with the accuracy of 1--2~mas/yr. The proper motions are based on positional data recovered from
the USNO-B1, 2MASS, URAT1, ALLWISE, UCAC5, and GAIA DR1 surveys with up to 10 positions spanning
an epoch difference of up to $\sim$~65~years, and reduced to GAIA DR1 TGAS frame using UCAC5 as the
reference catalog. Cluster members are photometrically identified by selecting horizontal-
and red-giant branch stars on color-magnitude diagrams, and the mean absolute proper motions of
the clusters with a typical formal error of $\sim$~0.4~mas/yr are computed by averaging the proper
motions of selected members. The inferred absolute proper motions of clusters are combined with
available radial-velocity data and heliocentric distance estimates to compute the cluster orbits
in terms of the Galactic potential models based on Miyamoto and Nagai disk, Hernquist spheroid,
and modified isothermal dark-matter halo (axisymmetric model without a bar) and the same model
+ rotating Ferre's bar (non-axisymmetric). Five distant clusters have higher-than-escape velocities,
most likely due to large errors of computed transversal velocities, whereas the computed orbits
of all other clusters remain bound to the Galaxy. Unlike previously published results, we find the
bar to affect substantially the orbits of most of the clusters, even those at large Galactocentric
distances, bringing appreciable chaotization, especially in the portions of the orbits close
to the Galactic center, and stretching out the orbits of some of the thick-disk clusters.
