We use PIONIER data from the ESO archive and GRAVITY data that were obtained in June 2017 with the four
8m telescopes. We use a parametric disk model and the 3D radiative transfer code MCFOST to reproduce
the Spectral Energy Distribution and match the interferometric observations. To match the SED
, our model requires a stellar luminosity of 2.5 Lsun, higher than any previously determined values.
Such a high value is needed to accommodate the circumstellar extinction caused by the highly inclined
disk, which has been neglected in previous studies. While using an effective temperature of 4800
K determined through high-resolution spectroscopy, we derive a stellar radius of 2.29 Rsun. These
revised fundamental parameters, when combined with the mass estimates available , lead to an age
of 0.5-2.0 Ma for RY Lup, in better agreement with the age of the Lupus association than previous determinations.
Our disk model nicely reproduces the interferometric GRAVITY data and is in good agreement with
the PIONIER ones. We derive an inner rim location at 0.12~au from the central star. This model corresponds
to an inclination of the inner disk of 50deg, which is in mild tension with previous determinations
of a more inclined outer disk from SPHERE (70 deg in NIR) and ALMA(67 $\pm$5 deg) images, but consistent
with the inclination determination from the ALMA CO spectra (55$\pm$5deg). Increasing the inclination
of the inner disk to 70 deg leads to a higher line-of-sight extinction and therefore requires a higher
stellar luminosity of 4.65 Lsun to match the observed flux levels. This luminosity would translate
to a stellar radius of 3.13~Rsun, leading to an age of 2-3~Ma, and a stellar mass of about 2 Msun, in
disagreement with the observed dynamical mass estimate of 1.3-1.5 Msun. Critically, this high-inclination
inner disk model also fails to reproduce the visibilities observed with GRAVITY.
