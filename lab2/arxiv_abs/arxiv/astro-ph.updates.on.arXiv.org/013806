Exoplanet atmosphere characterisation has become an important tool in understanding exoplanet
formation, evolution. However, clouds remain a key challenge for characterisation: upcoming
space telescopes (e.g. JWST, ARIEL) and ground-based high-resolution spectrographs (e.g. CRIRES+)
will produce data requiring detailed understanding of cloud formation and cloud effects. We aim
to understand how the micro-porosity of cloud particles affects the cloud structure, particle
size, and material composition. We examine the spectroscopic effects of micro-porous particles,
the particle size distribution, and non-spherical cloud particles. We expanded our kinetic non-equilibrium
cloud formation model and use a grid of prescribed 1D (T_gas-p_gas) DRIFT-PHOENIX profiles. We
applied the effective medium theory and the Mie theory to model the spectroscopic properties of
cloud particles with micro-porosity and a derived particle size distribution. We used a statistical
distribution of hollow spheres to represent the effects of non-spherical cloud particles. Highly
micro-porous cloud particles (90% vacuum) have a larger surface area, enabling efficient bulk
growth higher in the atmosphere than for compact particles. Increases in single-scattering albedo
and cross-sectional area for these mineral snowflakes cause the cloud deck to become optically
thin only at a wavelength of ~100 ${\rm \mu m}$ instead of at the ~20 ${\rm \mu m}$ for compact cloud
particles. A significant enhancement in albedo is also seen when cloud particles occur with a locally
changing Gaussian size distribution. Non-spherical particles increase the opacity of silicate
spectral features, which further increases the wavelength at which the clouds become optically
thin. JWST MIRI will be sensitive to signatures of micro-porous and non-spherical cloud particles
based on the wavelength at which clouds are optically thin.
