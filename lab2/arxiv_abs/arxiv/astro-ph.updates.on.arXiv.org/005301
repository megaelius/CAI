TESS is expected to discover dozens of temperate terrestrial planets orbiting M dwarfs whose atmospheres
could be followed up with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Currently, the TRAPPIST-1 system
serves as a benchmark to determine the feasibility and resources required to yield atmospheric
constraints. We assess these questions and leverage an information content analysis to determine
observing strategies for yielding high precision spectroscopy in transmission and emission.
Our goal is to guide observing strategies of temperate terrestrial planets in preparation for the
early JWST cycles. First, we explore JWST's current capabilities and expected spectral precision
for targets near the saturation limits of specific modes. In doing so, we highlight the enhanced
capabilities of high efficiency readout patterns that are being considered for implementation
in Cycle 2. We propose a partial saturation strategy to increase the achievable precision of JWST's
NIRSpec Prism. We show that JWST has the potential to detect the dominant absorbing gas in the atmospheres
of temperate terrestrial planets by the 10th transit using transmission spectroscopy techniques
in the near-IR. We also show that stacking $\gtrapprox$10 transmission spectroscopy observations
is unlikely to yield significant improvements in determining atmospheric composition. For emission
spectroscopy, we show that the MIRI LRS is unlikely to provide robust constraints on the atmospheric
composition of temperate terrestrial planets. Higher precision emission spectroscopy at wavelengths
longward of those accessible to MIRI LRS, as proposed in the Origins Space Telescope concept, could
help improve the constraints on molecular abundances of temperate terrestrial planets orbiting
M-dwarfs.
