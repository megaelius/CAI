The fraction of galaxies supported by internal rotation compared to galaxies stabilized by internal
pressure provides a strong constraint on galaxy formation models. In integral field spectroscopy
surveys, this fraction is biased because survey instruments typically only trace the inner parts
of the most massive galaxies. We present aperture corrections for the two most widely used stellar
kinematic quantities $V/\sigma$ and $\lambda_{R}$. Our demonstration involves integral field
data from the SAMI Galaxy Survey and the ATLAS$^{\rm{3D}}$ Survey. We find a tight relation for both
$V/\sigma$ and $\lambda_{R}$ when measured in different apertures that can be used as a linear transformation
as a function of radius, i.e., a first-order aperture correction. We find that $V/\sigma$ and $\lambda_{R}$
radial growth curves are well approximated by second order polynomials. By only fitting the inner
profile (0.5$R_{\rm{e}}$), we successfully recover the profile out to one $R_{\rm{e}}$ if a constraint
between the linear and quadratic parameter in the fit is applied. However, the aperture corrections
for $V/\sigma$ and $\lambda_{R}$ derived by extrapolating the profiles perform as well as applying
a first-order correction. With our aperture-corrected $\lambda_{R}$ measurements, we find that
the fraction of slow rotating galaxies increases with stellar mass. For galaxies with $\log M_{*}/M_{\odot}>$
11, the fraction of slow rotators is $35.9\pm4.3$ percent, but is underestimated if galaxies without
coverage beyond one $R_{\rm{e}}$ are not included in the sample ($24.2\pm5.3$ percent). With measurements
out to the largest aperture radius the slow rotator fraction is similar as compared to using aperture
corrected values ($38.3\pm4.4$ percent). Thus, aperture effects can significantly bias stellar
kinematic IFS studies, but this bias can now be removed with the method outlined here.
