The Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2): we summarise the processing and results of the identification of variable
source candidates of RR Lyrae stars, Cepheids, long period variables (LPVs), rotation modulation
(BY Dra-type) stars, delta Scuti & SX Phoenicis stars, and short-timescale variables. In this release
we aim to provide useful but not necessarily complete samples of candidates. The processed Gaia
data consist of the G, BP, and RP photometry during the first 22 months of operations as well as positions
and parallaxes. Various methods from classical statistics, data mining and time series analysis
were applied and tailored to the specific properties of Gaia data, as well as various visualisation
tools. The DR2 variability release contains: 228'904 RR Lyrae stars, 11'438 Cepheids, 151'761
LPVs, 147'535 stars with rotation modulation, 8'882 delta Scuti & SX Phoenicis stars, and 3'018
short-timescale variables. These results are distributed over a classification and various Specific
Object Studies (SOS) tables in the Gaia archive, along with the three-band time series and associated
statistics for the underlying 550'737 unique sources. We estimate that about half of them are newly
identified variables. The variability type completeness varies strongly as function of sky position
due to the non-uniform sky coverage and intermediate calibration level of this data. The probabilistic
and automated nature of this work implies certain completeness and contamination rates which are
quantified so that users can anticipate their effects. This means that even well-known variable
sources can be missed or misidentified in the published data. The DR2 variability release only represents
a small subset of the processed data. Future releases will include more variable sources and data
products; however, DR2 shows the (already) very high quality of the data and great promise for variability
studies.
