Aim: We aim to estimate the age and reddening parameters of already identified star clusters within
the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) in a consistent way using available photometric data, classify
them based on their mass and strength, and study their spatio- temporal distribution. Methods:
We have used a semi-automated quantitative method, developed in the first paper of this series (Paper
I), to estimate the cluster parameters using the V and I band photometric data from the Optical Gravitational
Lensing Experiment (OGLE) III survey. Results: We estimated parameters of 179 star clusters (17
newly parameterised) and classified them into 4 groups. We present an online catalog of parameters,
and cleaned and isochrone-fitted Color Magnitude Diagrams of 179 clusters. We compiled age information
of 468 clusters by combining previous studies with our catalog, to study their spatio-temporal
distribution. Most of the clusters located in the southern part of the SMC are in the age range 600
Myr-1.25 Gyr, whereas, the clusters younger than 100 Myr are mostly found in the northern SMC, with
the central SMC showing continuous cluster formation. The peak of the cluster age distribution
is identified at 130 Myr, very similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) in Paper I. Conclusion:
We suggest that the burst of cluster formation at 130 Myr is due to the most recent LMC-SMC interaction.
90% of the studied sample is found to have mass <1700 M_sun, suggesting that the SMC is dominated by
low mass clusters. There is a tentative evidence for compact clusters in the LMC when compared to
those in the Galaxy and the SMC. A progressive shifting of cluster location from the South to North
of the SMC is identified in last 600 Myr. The details of spatio-temporal distribution of clusters
presented in two videos in this study can be used as a tool to constrain details of the recent LMC-SMC
interactions.
