We model the ultraviolet spectra of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC~5548 obtained with the Hubble Space
Telescope during the 6-month reverberation-mapping campaign in 2014. Our model of the emission
from NGC 5548 corrects for overlying absorption and deblends the individual emission lines. Using
the modeled spectra, we measure the response to continuum variations for the deblended and absorption-corrected
individual broad emission lines, the velocity-dependent profiles of Ly$\alpha$ and C IV, and the
narrow and broad intrinsic absorption features. We find that the time lags for the corrected emission
lines are comparable to those for the original data. The velocity-binned lag profiles of Ly$\alpha$
and C IV have a double-peaked structure indicative of a truncated Keplerian disk. The narrow absorption
lines show delayed response to continuum variations corresponding to recombination in gas with
a density of $\sim 10^5~\rm cm^{-3}$. The high-ionization narrow absorption lines decorrelate
from continuum variations during the same period as the broad emission lines. Analyzing the response
of these absorption lines during this period shows that the ionizing flux is diminished in strength
relative to the far-ultraviolet continuum. The broad absorption lines associated with the X-ray
obscurer decrease in strength during this same time interval. The appearance of X-ray obscuration
in $\sim\,2012$ corresponds with an increase in the luminosity of NGC 5548 following an extended
low state. We suggest that the obscurer is a disk wind triggered by the brightening of NGC 5548 following
the decrease in size of the broad-line region during the preceding low-luminosity state.
