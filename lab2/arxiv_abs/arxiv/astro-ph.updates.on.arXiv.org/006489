%context More gas is inferred to be present in molecular cloud complexes than can be accounted for
by HI and CO emission, a phenomenon known as dark neutral medium (DNM) or CO-dark gas for the molecules.
%aims To see if molecular gas can be detected in Chamaeleon when gas column densities in the DNM were
inferred and CO emission was not detected. % methods We took 3mm absorption profiles of HCO+ and other
molecules toward quasars across Chamaeleon, 1 of which had detectable CO emission. We derived N(H2)
assuming N(HC+)/N(H2) = 3x10^{-9}. %results With the possible exception of 1 weak continuum target
HCO+ absorption was detected in all directions, \cch\ in 8 and HCN in 4 directions. The sightlines
divide in 2 groups according to their DNM content with 1 group of 8 directions having N(DNM) \ga 2x10^{20}
\pcc and another group of 5 directions having N(DNM) < .5x10^{20}\pcc. The groups have comparable
<N(HI)> in Chamaeleon 6-7 x 10^{20}\pcc and <N(H)/E(B-V) ~ 6-7x10^{21}\pcc/mag. They differ in
having quite different <E(B-V)> 0.33 vs 0.18 mag, <N(DNM)> 3.3 vs .14 x 10^{20}\pcc and <2N(H2)>
= 5.6 vs 0.8 x 10^{20} \pcc. Gas at more positive velocities is enriched in molecules and DNM. %conclusion
Overall the quantity of H2 inferred from HCO+ fully accounts for the previously-inferred DNM along
the studied sightlines. H2 is concentrated in the high-DNM group, where the molecular fraction
is 46% vs. 13% otherwise and 38% overall. Thus, neutral gas in the outskirts of the complex is mostly
atomic but the DNM is mostly molecular. Saturation of the HI emission may occur along 3 of the 4 sightlines
having the largest DNM column densities but there is no substantial reservoir of 'dark' atomic or
molecular gas that remains undetected as part of the inventory of dark neutral medium.
