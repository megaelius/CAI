Super-luminous supernovae that radiate more than 10^44 ergs per second at their peak luminosity
have recently been discovered in faint galaxies at redshifts of 0.1-4. Some evolve slowly, resembling
models of 'pair-instability' supernovae. Such models involve stars with original masses 140-260
times that of the Sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-30 solar masses. In these stars, the
photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted to electron-positron pairs, causing
rapid contraction and thermonuclear explosions. Many solar masses of 56Ni are synthesized; this
isotope decays to 56Fe via 56Co, powering bright light curves. Such massive progenitors are expected
to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early Universe. Recently, supernova 2007bi in a galaxy
at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years after the Big Bang) with a metallicity one-third that of
the Sun was observed to look like a fading pair-instability supernova. Here we report observations
of two slow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times and blue colours,
which are incompatible with pair-instability models. Their late-time light-curve and spectral
similarities to supernova 2007bi call the nature of that event into question. Our early spectra
closely resemble typical fast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered by
radioactivity. Modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses of magnetar-energized ejecta
demonstrates the possibility of a common explosion mechanism. The lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability
events suggests that their local rate of occurrence is less than 6x10^-6 times that of the core-collapse
rate.
