(Abr.) Laser guide stars employed at astronomical observatories provide artificial wavefront
reference sources to help correct (in part) the impact of atmospheric turbulence on astrophysical
observations. Following the recent commissioning of the 4 Laser Guide Star Facility (4LGSF) on
UT4 at the VLT, we characterize the spectral signature of the uplink beams from the 22W lasers to assess
the impact of laser scattering from the 4LGSF on science observations. We use the MUSE optical integral
field spectrograph to acquire spectra at a resolution of R~3000 of the uplink laser beams over the
wavelength range of 4750\AA\ to 9350\AA. We report the first detection of laser-induced Raman scattering
by N2, O2, CO2, H2O and (tentatively) CH4 molecules in the atmosphere above the astronomical observatory
of Cerro Paranal. In particular, our observations reveal the characteristic spectral signature
of laser photons -- but 480\AA\ to 2210\AA\ redder than the original laser wavelength of 5889.959\AA\
-- landing on the 8.2m primary mirror of UT4 after being Raman-scattered on their way up to the sodium
layer. Laser-induced Raman scattering is not unique to the observatory of Cerro Paranal, but common
to any astronomical telescope employing a laser-guide-star (LGS) system. It is thus essential
for any optical spectrograph coupled to a LGS system to handle thoroughly the possibility of a Raman
spectral contamination via a proper baffling of the instrument and suitable calibrations procedures.
These considerations are particularly applicable for the HARMONI optical spectrograph on the
upcoming Extremely Large Telescope. At sites hosting multiple telescopes, laser collision prediction
tools also ought to account for the presence of Raman emission from the uplink laser beam(s) to avoid
the unintentional contamination of observations acquired with telescopes in the vicinity of a
LGS system.
