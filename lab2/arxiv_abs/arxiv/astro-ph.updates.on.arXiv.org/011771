We have conducted ALMA CO isotopes and 1.3 mm continuum observations toward filamentary molecular
clouds of the N159W-South region in the Large Magellanic Cloud with an angular resolution of $\sim$0"25
($\sim$0.07 pc). Although the previous lower-resolution ($\sim$1") ALMA observations revealed
that there is a high-mass protostellar object at an intersection of two line-shaped filaments in
$^{13}$CO with the length scale of $\sim$10 pc, the spatially resolved observations, in particular,
toward the highest column density part traced by the 1.3 mm continuum emission, the N159W-South
clump, show complicated hub-filamentary structures. We also discovered that there are multiple
protostellar sources with bipolar outflows along the massive filament. The redshifted/blueshifted
components of the $^{13}$CO emission around the massive filaments/protostars have complementary
distributions, which is considered to be a possible piece of evidence for a cloud-cloud collision.
We propose a new scenario in which the supersonically colliding gas flow triggers the formation
of both the massive filament and protostars. This is a modification of the earlier scenario of cloud-cloud
collision, by Fukui et al., that postulated the two filamentary clouds occur prior to the high-mass
star formation. A recent theoretical study of the shock compression in colliding molecular flows
by Inoue et al. demonstrates that the formation of filaments with hub structure is a usual outcome
of the collision, lending support for the present scenario. The theory argues that the filaments
are formed as dense parts in a shock compressed sheet-like layer, which resembles $"$an umbrella
with pokes.$"$
