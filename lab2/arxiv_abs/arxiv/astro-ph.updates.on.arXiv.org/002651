We develop an extension of \textit{the Halo Model} that describes analytically the corrections
to the matter power spectrum due to the physics of baryons. We extend these corrections to the weak-lensing
shear angular power spectrum. Within each halo, our baryonic model accounts for: 1) a central galaxy,
the major stellar component whose properties are derived from abundance matching techniques;
2) a hot plasma in hydrostatic equilibrium and 3) an adiabatically-contracted dark matter component.
This analytic approach allows us to compare our model to the dark-matter-only case. Our basic assumptions
are tested against the hydrodynamical simulations of Martizzi et. al. (2014), with which a remarkable
agreement is found. Our baryonic model has only one free parameter, $M_{\rm crit}$, the critical
halo mass that marks the transition between feedback-dominated halos, mostly devoid of gas, and
gas rich halos, in which AGN feedback effects become weaker. We explore the entire cosmological
parameter space, using the angular power spectrum in three redshift bins as the observable, assuming
a Euclid-like survey. We derive the corresponding constraints on the cosmological parameters,
as well as the possible bias introduced by neglecting the effects of baryonic physics. We find that,
up to $\ell_{max}$=4000, baryonic physics plays very little role in the cosmological parameters
estimation. However, if one goes up to $\ell_{max}$=8000, the marginalized errors on the cosmological
parameters can be significantly reduced, but neglecting baryonic physics can lead to bias in the
recovered cosmological parameters up to 10$\sigma$. These biases are removed if one takes into
account the main baryonic parameter, $M_{\rm crit}$, which can also be determined up to 1-2\%, along
with the other cosmological parameters.
