Resolving the small length scale of thermonuclear detonation waves (TNDW) in supernovae is currently
not possible in multidimensional full-star simulations. Additionally, multidimensional simulations
usually use small, over-simplistic reaction networks and adopt an ad-hoc transition criterion
to nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE). The errors due to the applied approximations are not
well understood. We present here a new accurate and efficient numerical scheme that accelerates
the calculations by orders of magnitudes and allows the structure of TNDW to be resolved. The numerical
scheme has two important ingredients: 1. A burning limiter that broadens the width of the TNDW while
accurately preserving its internal structure, and 2. An adaptive separation of isotopes into groups
that are in nuclear-statistical-quasi-equilibrium, which resolves the time-consuming burning
calculation of reactions that are nearly balanced-out. Burning is calculated in-situ employing
the required large-networks without the use of post-processing or pre-describing the conditions
behind the TNDW. In particular, the approach-to and deviation-from nuclear-statistical-equilibrium
(NSE) is calculated self-consistently. The scheme can be easily implemented in multidimensional
codes. We test our scheme against accurate solutions of the structure of TNDW and against homogenous
expansion from NSE. We show that with resolutions that are typical for multidimensional full-star
simulations, we obtain an accuracy that is better than a percent for the resolved scales (where the
burning limiter is not applied) and a few percent for unresolved scales (broadened by the burning
limiter).
