The X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) that will be on board of the Athena telescope will provide an
unprecedented view of the intracluster medium (ICM) kinematics through the observation of gas
velocity, $v$, and velocity dispersion, $w$, via centroid-shift and broadening of emission lines,
respectively. The improvement of data quality and quantity requires an assessment of the systematics
associated with this new data analysis, namely biases, statistical and systematic errors, and
possible correlations between the different measured quantities. We have developed an end-to-end
X-IFU simulator that mimics a full X-ray spectral fitting analysis on a set of mock event-lists,
obtained using SIXTE (Wilms et al. 2014). We have applied it to three hydrodynamical simulations
of a Coma-like cluster (Gaspari & Churazov 2013) that include the injection of turbulence. This
allowed us to assess the ability of X-IFU to map 5 physical quantities in the cluster core: emission
measure, temperature, metal abundance, velocity and velocity dispersion. Finally, starting
from our measurements maps, we computed the 2D structure function (SF) of emission measure fluctuations,
$v$ and $w$ and compared them with the ones derived directly from the simulations. All quantities
match with input ones without bias, with systematic errors below 5%, except velocity dispersion,
whose error reaches about 15%. Moreover, all measurements prove to be statistically independent,
indicating the robustness of the fitting method. Most importantly, we recover the slope of the SFs
in the inertial regime with excellent accuracy, but we observe a systematic excess in the normalization
of both SF$_v$ and SF$_w$ ascribed to the simplistic assumption of uniform and (bi-)Gaussian measurement
errors. (abridged)
