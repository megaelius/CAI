We present results of cosmological N-body hydrodynamic chemistry simulations of primordial structure
growth and evolution in a scenario with warm dark matter (WDM) having a mass of 3 keV (thermal relic)
and compare with a model consisting of standard cold dark matter (CDM). We focus on the high-redshift
universe ($z>6$), where the structure formation process should better reflect the primordial
(linear) differences in terms of matter power spectrum. We find that early epochs can be exceptional
probes of the dark-matter nature. Non-linear WDM power spectra and mass functions are up to 2 dex
lower than in CDM and show spreads of factor of a few persisting in the whole first Gyr. Runaway molecular
cooling in WDM haloes results severely inhibited because of the damping of power at large $k$ modes
and hence cosmic (population III and II-I) star formation rate (SFR) is usually suppressed with
respect to CDM predictions. Luminous objects formed in a WDM background are very rare at $z>10$,
due to the sparser and retarded evolution of early WDM mini-haloes during the dark ages and their
lack can be fitted with a simple analytical formula depending only on magnitude and redshift. Future
high-$z$ observations of faint galaxies have the potential to discriminate between CDM and WDM
scenarios by means of cosmic stellar mass density (SMD) and specific SFR, as well. When compared
to the effects of alternative cosmologies (e.g. non-Gaussian or dark-energy models) or of high-order
corrections at large $z$ (e.g. primordial streaming motions or changes in the pristine IMF) the
ones caused by WDM are definitely more dramatic.
