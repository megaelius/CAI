Using the \Planck\ full-mission data, we present a detection of the temperature (and therefore
velocity) dispersion due to the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect from clusters of galaxies.
To suppress the primary CMB and instrumental noise we derive a matched filter and then convolve it
with the \Planck\ foreground-cleaned "{\tt 2D-ILC\," maps. By using the Meta Catalogue of X-ray
detected Clusters of galaxies (MCXC), we determine the normalized rms dispersion of the temperature
fluctuations at the positions of clusters, finding that this shows excess variance compared with
the noise expectation. We then build an unbiased statistical estimator of the signal, determining
that the normalized mean temperature dispersion of $1526$ clusters is $\langle \left(\Delta T/T
\right)^{2} \rangle = (1.64 \pm 0.48) \times 10^{-11}$. However, comparison with analytic calculations
and simulations suggest that around $0.7\,\sigma$ of this result is due to cluster lensing rather
than the kSZ effect. By correcting this, the temperature dispersion is measured to be $\langle \left(\Delta
T/T \right)^{2} \rangle = (1.35 \pm 0.48) \times 10^{-11}$, which gives a detection at the $2.8\,\sigma$
level. We further convert uniform-weight temperature dispersion into a measurement of the line-of-sight
velocity dispersion, by using estimates of the optical depth of each cluster (which introduces
additional uncertainty into the estimate). We find that the velocity dispersion is $\langle v^{2}
\rangle =(123\,000 \pm 71\,000)\,({\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1})^{2}$, which is consistent with findings
from other large-scale structure studies, and provides direct evidence of statistical homogeneity
on scales of $600\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. Our study shows the promise of using cross-correlations of
the kSZ effect with large-scale structure in order to constrain the growth of structure.
