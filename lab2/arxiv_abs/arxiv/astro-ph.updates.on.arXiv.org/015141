Detecting and characterising exoworlds around very young stars (age$<$10 Myr) are key aspects
of exoplanet demographic studies, especially for understanding the mechanisms and timescales
of planet formation and migration. However, detection using the radial velocity method alone can
be very challenging, since the amplitude of the signals due to magnetic activity of such stars can
be orders of magnitude larger than those induced even by massive planets. We observed the very young
($\sim$2 Myr) and very active star V830 Tau with the HARPS-N spectrograph to independently confirm
and characterise the previously reported hot Jupiter V830 Tau b ($K_{\rm b}=68\pm11$ m/s; $m_{\rm
b}sini_{\rm b}=0.57\pm0.10$ $M_{jup}$; $P_{\rm b}=4.927\pm0.008$ d). Due to the observed $\sim$1
km/s radial velocity scatter clearly attributable to V830 Tau's magnetic activity, we analysed
radial velocities extracted with different pipelines and modelled them using several state-of-the-art
tools. We devised injection-recovery simulations to support our results and characterise our
detection limits. The analysis of the radial velocities was aided by using simultaneous photometric
and spectroscopic diagnostics. Despite the high quality of our HARPS-N data and the diversity of
tests we performed, we could not detect the planet V830 Tau b in our data and confirm its existence.
Our simulations show that a statistically-significant detection of the claimed planetary Doppler
signal is very challenging. Much as it is important to continue Doppler searches for planets around
young stars, utmost care must be taken in the attempt to overcome the technical difficulties to be
faced in order to achieve their detection and characterisation. This point must be kept in mind when
assessing their occurrence rate, formation mechanisms and migration pathways, especially without
evidence of their existence from photometric transits.
