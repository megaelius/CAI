We present new ground-based, multi-colour, broad-band photometric measurements of the physical
parameters, transmission and emission spectra of the transiting extrasolar planet WASP-19b.
The measurements are based on observations of 8 transits and four occultations using the 1.5m Danish
Telescope, 14 transits at the PEST observatory, and 1 transit observed simultaneously through
four optical and three near-infrared filters, using the GROND instrument on the ESO 2.2m telescope.
We use these new data to measure refined physical parameters for the system. We find the planet to
be more bloated and the system to be twice as old as initially thought. We also used published and archived
datasets to study the transit timings, which do not depart from a linear ephemeris. We detected an
anomaly in the GROND transit light curve which is compatible with a spot on the photosphere of the
parent star. The starspot position, size, spot contrast and temperature were established. Using
our new and published measurements, we assembled the planet's transmission spectrum over the 370-2350
nm wavelength range and its emission spectrum over the 750-8000 nm range. By comparing these data
to theoretical models we investigated the theoretically-predicted variation of the apparent
radius of WASP-19b as a function of wavelength and studied the composition and thermal structure
of its atmosphere. We conclude that: there is no evidence for strong optical absorbers at low pressure,
supporting the common idea that the planet's atmosphere lacks a dayside inversion; the temperature
of the planet is not homogenized, because the high warming of its dayside causes the planet to be more
efficient in re-radiating than redistributing energy to the night side; the planet seems to be outside
of any current classification scheme.
