Total eclipses permit a deep analysis of both the inner and the outer parts of the corona using the
continuum White-Light (W-L) radiations from electrons (K-corona), the superposed spectrum of
forbidden emission lines from ions (E-corona) and the dust component with F-lines (F-corona).
By sufficiently dispersing the W-L spectrum, the Fraunhofer (F) spectrum of the dust component
of the corona appears and the continuum Thomson radiation can be evaluated. The superposed emission
lines of ions with different degrees of ionization are studied to allow the measurement of temperatures,
non-thermal velocities, Doppler shifts and abundances. We describe a slit spectroscopic experiment
of high spectral resolution for providing an analysis of the most typical parts of the quasi-minimum
type corona observed during the total solar eclipse of Aug. 21, 2017 observed from Idaho, USA. Streamers,
active region enhancements and polar coronal holes (CHs) are well measured using deep spectra.
60 spectra are obtained during the totality with a long slit, covering +/-3 solar radii in the range
of 510 to 590nm. The K+F continuum corona is well exposed up to 2 solar radius. The F-corona can be measured
even at the solar limb. New weak emission lines were discovered or confirmed. The rarely observed
high FIP ArX line is recorded almost everywhere; the FeXIV and NiXIII lines are well recorded everywhere.
For the first time hot lines are also measured inside the CH regions. The radial variations of the
non-thermal turbulent velocities of the lines do not show a great departure from the average values.
No significantly large Doppler shifts are seen anywhere in the inner and the middle corona. The wings
of the FeXIV line show some non-Gaussianity.
