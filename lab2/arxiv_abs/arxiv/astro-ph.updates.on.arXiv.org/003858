Ground-based gamma-ray astronomy in the Very High Energy (VHE, E>100 GeV) regime has fast become
one of the most interesting and productive sub-fields of astrophysics today. Utilizing the Imaging
Atmospheric Cherenkov Technique (IACT) to reconstruct the energy and direction of incoming gamma-ray
photons from the universe, several source-classes have been revealed by previous and current generations
of IACT telescopes (e.g. Whipple, MAGIC, HESS and VERITAS). The next generation pointing IACT experiment,
the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), will provide increased sensitivity across a wider energy
range and with better angular resolution. With the development of CTA, the future of IACT pointing
arrays is being directed towards having more and more telescopes (and hence cameras), and therefore
the need to develop low-cost pixels with acceptable light-collection efficiency is clear. One
of the primary paths to the above goal is to replace Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs) with Silicon-PMs
(SiPMs) as the pixels in IACT telescope cameras. However SiPMs are not yet mature enough to replace
PMTs for several reasons: sensitivity to unwanted longer wavelengths while lacking sensitivity
at short wavelengths, small physical area, high cost, optical cross-talk and dark rates. Here we
propose a novel method to build relatively low-cost SiPM-based pixels utilising a disk of wavelength-shifting
material, which overcomes some of these drawbacks by collecting light over a larger area than standard
SiPMs and improving sensitivity to shorter wavelengths while reducing background. We aim to optimise
the design of such pixels, integrating them into an actual 7-pixel cluster which will be inserted
into a MAGIC camera and tested during real observations. Results of simulations, laboratory measurements
and the current status of the cluster design and development will be presented.
