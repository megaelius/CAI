The deceptive simplicity of the radius enclosing an arbitrary 50 percent of a galaxy's light has
hamstrung the understanding of early-type galaxies (ETGs). Half a century ago, using the "effective
half-light radii" $R_e$ from de Vaucouleurs' $R^{1/4}$ model, S\'ersic reported that bright ETGs
follow the relation $\mathfrak{M}_B\propto2.5\log R_e$; and consequently one has that $\langle\mu\rangle_e\propto2.5\log
R_e$ and $\mu_e\propto2.5\log R_e$, where $\mu_e$ and $\langle\mu\rangle_e$ are the effective
surface brightness at $R_e$ and the mean effective surface brightness within $R_e$, respectively.
S\'ersic additionally observed an apparent transition which led him to advocate for a division
between what he called dwarf and giant ETGs; a belief frequently restated to occur at $\mathfrak{M}_B\approx-18$
mag or S\'ersic $n\approx 2.5$. Here, the location of this false dichotomy is shown to change by more
than 3 mag simply depending on the arbitrary percentage of light used to quantify a galaxy's size,
voiding claims for different formation physics operating on ETGs brighter and fainter than $\mathfrak{M}_B\approx-18$
mag. This is of further importance because quantities such as dynamical mass $\sigma^2R/G$, gravitational
binding energy $GM^2/R$, acceleration $GM/R^2$, and the "Fundamental Plane" depend systematically
on the arbitrary percentage of light used to define $R$, with implications for dark matter estimates,
galaxy formation theories, compact massive galaxies, studies of peculiar velocity flows, and
more. Finally, some of the vast literature which has advocated for segregating the ETG population
at $\mathfrak{M}_B\approx-18$ mag ($M\approx1$-$2\times10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$) is addressed,
and it is revealed how this pervasive mindset has spilled-over to influence both the classical bulge
versus pseudobulge debate and recently also correlations involving supermassive black hole masses.
