Statistical studies of exoplanets have shown that giant planets are more commonly hosted by metal-rich
dwarf stars than low-metallicity ones, while such a correlation is not evident for lower-mass planets.
The search for giant planets around metal-poor stars and the estimate of their occurrence $f_p$
is an important element in providing support to models of planet formation. We present results from
the HARPS-N search for giant planets orbiting metal-poor ($-1.0\leq[Fe/H]\leq-0.5$ dex) stars
in the northern hemisphere complementing a previous HARPS survey on southern stars in order to update
the estimate of $f_p$. High-precision HARPS-N observations of 42 metal-poor stars are used to search
for planetary signals to be fitted using differential evolution MCMC single-Keplerian models.
We then join our detections to the results of the previous HARPS survey on 88 metal-poor stars to provide
a preliminar estimate of the two-hemisphere $f_p$. We report the detection of two new giant planets
around HD 220197 and HD 233832. The first companion has M$\sin{i}=0.20_{-0.04}^{+0.07}$ M$_{\rm
Jup}$ and orbital period of $1728_{-80}^{+162}$ days, and for the second companion we find two solutions
of equal statistical weight having periods $2058_{-40}^{+47}$ and $4047_{-117}^{+91}$ days
and minimum masses of $1.78_{-0.06}^{+0.08}$ and $2.72_{-0.23}^{+0.23}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$, respectively.
Joining our two detections with the three from the southern survey we obtain a preliminary and conservative
estimate of global frequency of $f_p=3.84_{-1.06}^{+2.45}\%$ for giant planets around metal-poor
stars. The two new giant planets orbit dwarf stars at the metal-rich end of the HARPS-N metal-poor
sample, corroborating previous results suggesting that giant planet frequency still is a rising
function of host star [Fe/H]. We also note that all detections in the overall sample are giant long-period
planets.
