The reliability of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) may be limited by the imprint of their galactic origins.
To investigate the connection between supernovae and their host characteristics, we developed
an improved method to estimate the stellar population age of the host as well as the local environment
around the site of the supernova. We use a Bayesian method to estimate the star formation history
and mass weighted age of a supernova's environment by matching observed spectral energy distributions
to a synthesized stellar population. Applying this age estimator to both the photometrically and
spectroscopically classified Sloan Digital Sky Survey II supernovae (N=103) we find a $0.114 \pm
0.039~{\rm mag}$ `step' in the average Hubble residual at a stellar age of $\sim 8~\text{Gyr}$;
it is nearly twice the size of the currently popular mass step. We then apply a principal component
analysis on the SALT2 parameters, host stellar mass, and local environment age. We find that a new
parameter, PC$_1$, consisting of a linear combination of stretch, host stellar mass, and local
age, shows a very significant ($4.7\sigma$) correlation with Hubble residuals. There is a much
broader range of PC$_1$ values found in the Hubble flow sample when compared with the Cepheid calibration
galaxies. These samples have mildly statistically different average PC$_1$ values, at $\sim 2.5\sigma$,
resulting in at most a 1.3% reduction in the evaluation of H$_0$. Despite accounting for the highly
significant trend in SNIa Hubble residuals, there remains a 9% discrepancy between the most recent
precision estimates of H$_0$ using SNIa and the CMB.
