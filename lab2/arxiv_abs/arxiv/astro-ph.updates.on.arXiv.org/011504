Using 145 early- and late-type galaxies (ETGs and LTGs) with directly-measured super-massive
black hole masses, $M_{BH}$, we build upon our previous discoveries that: (i) LTGs, most of which
have been alleged to contain a pseudobulge, follow the relation $M_{BH}\propto\,M_{*,sph}^{2.16\pm0.32}$;
and (ii) the ETG relation $M_{BH}\propto\,M_{*,sph}^{1.27\pm0.07}$ is an artifact of ETGs with/without
disks following parallel $M_{BH}\propto\,M_{*,sph}^{1.9\pm0.2}$ relations which are offset
by an order of magnitude in the $M_{BH}$-direction. Here, we searched for substructure in the $M_{BH}$--(central
velocity dispersion, $\sigma$) diagram using our recently published, multi-component, galaxy
decompositions; investigating divisions based on the presence of a depleted stellar core (major
dry-merger), a disk (minor wet/dry-merger, gas accretion), or a bar (evolved unstable disk). The
S\'ersic and core-S\'ersic galaxies define two distinct relations: $M_{BH}\propto\sigma^{5.75\pm0.34}$
and $M_{BH}\propto\sigma^{8.64\pm1.10}$, with $\Delta_{rms|BH}=0.55$ and $0.46$~dex, respectively.
We also report on the consistency with the slopes and bends in the galaxy luminosity ($L$)--$\sigma$
relation due to S\'ersic and core-S\'ersic ETGs, and LTGs which all have S\'ersic light-profiles.
Two distinct relations (superficially) reappear in the $M_{BH}$--$\sigma$ diagram upon separating
galaxies with/without a disk (primarily for the ETG sample), while we find no significant offset
between barred and non-barred galaxies, nor between galaxies with/without active galactic nuclei.
We also address selection biases purported to affect the scaling relations for dynamically-measured
$M_{BH}$ samples. Our new, (morphological type)-dependent, $M_{BH}$--$\sigma$ relations more
precisely estimate $M_{BH}$ in other galaxies, and hold implications for galaxy/black hole co-evolution
theories, and simulations. (Abridged)
