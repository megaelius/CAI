We present measurements of the anisotropic galaxy clustering from the Data Release 9 (DR9) CMASS
sample of the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We analyze the broad-range
shape of the monopole and quadrupole correlation functions to obtain constraints, at the effective
redshift z=0.57 of the sample, on the Hubble expansion rate H(z), the angular-diameter distance
D_A(z), the normalized growth rate f(z)\sigma_8(z), the physical matter density \Omega_m h^2,
and the biased amplitude of matter fluctuation b\sigma_8(z). We obtain {H(0.57), D_A(0.57), f(0.57)\sigma_8(0.57),
\Omega_m h^2, b\sigma_8(0.57)} = {87.6_{-6.8}^{+6.7}, 1396\pm73, 0.126_{-0.010}^{+0.008},
1.19\pm0.14, 0.428\pm0.066} and their covariance matrix as well. The parameters which are not
well constrained by our of galaxy clustering analysis are marginalized over with wide flat priors.
Since no priors from other data sets (i.e., CMB) are adopted and no dark energy models are assumed,
our results from BOSS CMASS galaxy clustering alone may be combined with other data sets, i.e. CMB,
SNe, lensing or other galaxy clustering data to constrain the parameters of a given cosmological
model. We show that the major power on constraining dark energy from the anisotropic galaxy clustering
signal, as compared to the angular-averaged one (monopole), arises from including the normalized
growth rate f(z)\sigma_8(z). In the case of the wCDM cosmological model our single-probe CMASS
constraints, combined with CMB (WMAP9+SPT), yield a value for the dark energy equation of state
parameter of w=-0.90\pm0.11. Therefore, it is important to include f(z)\sigma_8(z) while investigating
the nature of dark energy with current and upcoming large-scale galaxy surveys.
