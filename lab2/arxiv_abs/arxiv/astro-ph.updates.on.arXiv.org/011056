The full spatial structure and temporal evolution of the accretion flow into the envelopes of growing
gas giants in their nascent discs is only accessible in simulations. Such simulations are constrained
in their approach of computing the formation of gas giants by dimensionality, resolution, consideration
of self-gravity, energy treatment and the adopted opacity law. Our study explores how a number of
these parameters affect that measured accretion rate of a Saturn-mass planet. We present a global
3D radiative hydrodynamics framework using the FARGOCA-code. The planet is represented by a gravitational
potential with a smoothing length at the location of the planet. No mass or energy sink is used, instead
luminosity and gas accretion rates are self-consistently computed. We find that the gravitational
smoothing length must be resolved by at least 10 grid cells to obtain converged measurements of the
gas accretion rates. Secondly, we find gas accretion rates into planetary envelopes compatible
with previous studies, and continue to explain those via the structure of our planetary envelopes
and their luminosities. Our measured gas accretion rates are formally in the stage of Kelvin-Helmholtz
contraction due to the modest entropy loss that can be obtained over the simulation time-scale,
but our accretion rates are compatible with those expected during late run-away accretion. Our
detailed simulations of the gas flow into the envelope of a Saturn-mass planet provides a framework
for understanding the general problem of gas accretion during planet formation and highlights
circulation features that develop inside the planetary envelopes. Those circulation features
feedback into the envelope energetics and can have further implications for transporting dust
into the inner regions of the envelope.
