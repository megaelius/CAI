Molecules and dust produced by the atmospheres of cool evolved stars contribute to a significant
amount of the total material found in the interstellar medium. To understand the mechanism behind
the mass loss of these stars, it is of pivotal importance to investigate the structure and dynamics
of their atmospheres. Our goal is to verify if the extended molecular and dust layers of the carbon-rich
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star V Oph, and their time variations, can be explained by dust-driven
winds triggered by stellar pulsation alone, or if other mechanisms are operating. We model V Oph
mid-infrared interferometric VLTI-MIDI data ($8$-$13~\mu$m), at phases $0.18$, $0.49$, $0.65$,
together with literature photometric data, using the latest-generation self-consistent dynamic
atmosphere models for carbon-rich stars: DARWIN. We determine the fundamental stellar parameters:
$T_\text{eff} = 2600~$K, $L_\text{bol} = 3585~$L$_{\odot}$, $M = 1.5~$M$_{\odot}$, $C/O = 1.35$,
$\dot{M} = 2.50\cdot10^{-6}$M$_{\odot}$/yr. We calculate the stellar photospheric radii at
the three phases: $479$, $494$, $448$ R$_{\odot}$; and the dust radii: $780$, $853$, $787$ R$_{\odot}$.
The dynamic models can fairly explain the observed $N$-band visibility and spectra, although there
is some discrepancy between the data and the models, which is discussed in the text. We discuss the
possible causes of the temporal variations of the outer atmosphere, deriving an estimate of the
magnetic field strength, and computing upper limits for the Alfv\'{e}n waves velocity. In addition,
using period-luminosity sequences, and interferometric modeling, we suggest V Oph as a candidate
to be reclassified as a semi-regular star.
