We study the redshift evolution of the X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) scaling relations for
galaxy groups and clusters in the FABLE suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Using
an expanded sample of $27$ high-resolution zoom-in simulations, together with a uniformly-sampled
cosmological volume to sample low-mass systems, we find very good agreement with the majority of
observational constraints up to $z \sim 1$. We predict significant deviations of all examined scaling
relations from the simple self-similar expectations. While the slopes are approximately independent
of redshift, the normalisations evolve positively with respect to self-similarity, even for commonly-used
mass proxies such as the $Y_{\mathrm{X}}$ parameter. These deviations are due to a combination
of factors, including more effective AGN feedback in lower mass haloes, larger binding energy of
gas at a given halo mass at higher redshifts and larger non-thermal pressure support from kinetic
motions at higher redshifts. Our results have important implications for cluster cosmology from
upcoming SZ surveys such as SPT-3G, ACTpol and CMB-S4, as relatively small changes in the observable--mass
scaling relations (within theoretical uncertainties) have a large impact on the predicted number
of high-redshift clusters and hence on our ability to constrain cosmology using cluster abundances.
In addition, we find that the intrinsic scatter of the relations, which agrees well with most observational
constraints, increases at lower redshifts and for lower mass systems. This calls for a more complex
parametrization than adopted in current observational studies to be able to accurately account
for selection biases.
