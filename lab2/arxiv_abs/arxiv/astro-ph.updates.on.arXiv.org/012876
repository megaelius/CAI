The streaming instability is a leading candidate mechanism to explain the formation of planetesimals.
Yet, the role of this instability in the driving of turbulence in protoplanetary disks, given its
fundamental nature as a linear hydrodynamical instability, has so far not been investigated in
detail. We study the turbulence that is induced by the streaming instability as well as its interaction
with the vertical shear instability. For this purpose, we employ the FLASH Code to conduct two-dimensional
axisymmetric global disk simulations spanning radii from $1$ au to $100$ au, including the mutual
drag between gas and dust as well as the radial and vertical stellar gravity. If the streaming instability
and the vertical shear instability start their growth at the same time, we find the turbulence in
the dust mid-plane layer to be primarily driven by the streaming instability. It gives rise to vertical
gas motions with a Mach number of up to ${\sim}10^{-2}$. The dust scale height is set in a self-regulatory
manner to about $1\%$ of the gas scale height. In contrast, if the vertical shear instability is allowed
to saturate before the dust is introduced into our simulations, then it continues to be the main source
of the turbulence in the dust layer. The vertical shear instability induces turbulence with a Mach
number of ${\sim}10^{-1}$ and thus impedes dust sedimentation. Nonetheless, we find the vertical
shear instability and the streaming instability in combination to lead to radial dust concentration
in long-lived accumulations which are significantly denser than those formed by the streaming
instability alone. Thus, the vertical shear instability may promote planetesimal formation by
creating weak overdensities that act as seeds for the streaming instability.
