We report our optical spectroscopic study of the nucleus and its surrounding region of a nearby luminous
infrared galaxy NGC 4418. This galaxy has been known to host a compact obscured nucleus, showing
distinct characteristics such as a very compact ($\sim 20$ pc) sub-mm and mid-infrared core and
dusty circumnuclear region with massive molecular gas concentration. We detected dusty superwind
outflow at $\gtrsim 1$ kpc scale along the disk semiminor axis in both shock-heated emission lines
and enhanced interstellar Na D absorption. This superwind shows basic characteristics similar
to those of the prototypical superwind in the starburst galaxy M82, such as a kpc-scale extended
structure of gas and dust along the disk minor axis, outflowing components (multiphase gas and dust),
physical conditions of the ionized gas, and monotonically blueshifting radial velocity field
with increasing distance from the nucleus on the front side of the superwind. We also detected a moderately
extinct starburst population in the SDSS nuclear spectrum with the burst age of $\simeq 10$ Myr and
stellar mass of $\simeq 1\times 10^7\ M_\mathrm{\odot}$. It is powerful enough to drive the superwind
within the dynamical age of the superwind ($\simeq 10$ Myr). On the basis of comparison between this
starburst--superwind scenario and the observations in terms of the burst age, stellar mass, infrared
luminosity, and obscuration in the optical bands, we argue that this superwind-driving starburst
is separate from the sub-mm core even if the core is a very young star cluster. Therefore, this galaxy
hosts both the enshrouded compact core and the superwind-driving circumnuclear starburst.
