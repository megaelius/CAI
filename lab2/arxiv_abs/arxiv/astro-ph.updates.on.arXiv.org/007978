We present a multiwavelength study of the massive galaxy cluster Abell 1763 at redshift z = 0.231.
Image analysis of a 19.6 ks Chandra archival observation reveals a cluster-wide spiral of enhanced
surface brightness in the intracluster medium (ICM). While such spirals are understood to form
in clusters with sloshing strong cool cores (SCCs), the gas comprising the spiral's apex is of intermediate
entropy ($\sim$ 110 keV cm$^{2}$) and cooling time ($\sim$ 6.8 Gyr), indicating core disruption
is occurring throughout the spiral formation process. Two subclusters dominated by the second-
and third-ranked galaxies in the system lie along a line parallel to the elongation axis of the primary
cluster's ICM. Both subsystems appear to have fallen in along a previously discovered intercluster
filament and are each considered candidates as the perturber responsible for initiating disruptive
core sloshing. Dynamical analysis indicates infall is occurring with a relative radial velocity
of $\sim$ 1800 km s$^{-1}$. The brightest cluster galaxy of Abell 1763 possesses a high line-of-sight
peculiar velocity (v$_{pec}$ $\sim$ 650 km s$^{-1}$) and hosts a powerful (P$_{1.4}$ $\sim$ 10$^{26}$
W Hz$^{-1}$) bent double-lobed radio source, likely shaped by the relative bulk ICM flow induced
in the merger. The cluster merger model of SCC destruction invokes low impact parameter infall as
the condition required for core transformation. In contrast to this, the high angular momentum
event occurring in Abell 1763 suggests that off-axis mergers play a greater role in establishing
the non-cool core cluster population than previously assumed.
