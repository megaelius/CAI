The data on the inclusive flux of cosmic positrons and electrons ($e^++e^{-}$) have been recently
collected from GeV to tens of TeV energies by several experiments with unprecedented precision.
In addition, the Fermi-LAT Collaboration has provided a new energy spectrum for the upper bounds
on the $e^++e^{-}$ dipole anisotropy. This observable can bring information on the emission from
local Galactic sources, notably measured with high precision at radio frequencies. We develop
a framework in which $e^-$ and $e^+$ measured at Earth from GeV up to tens of TeV energies have a composite
origin. A dedicated analysis is deserved to Vela YZ and Cygnus Loop Supernova Remnants (SNRs), which
can contribute significantly to the $e^-$ flux. We investigate the consistency of this model using
the three physical observables: the radio flux from Vela YZ and Cygnus Loop at all the available frequencies,
the $e^++e^-$ flux from five experiments from the GeV to tens of TeV energy, the $e^++e^-$ dipole
anisotropy upper limits from 50 GeV to about 1 TeV. We find that the radio flux for these nearby SNRs
strongly constraints the properties of the injection electron spectrum, partially compatible
with the looser constraints derived from the $e^+ + e^-$ flux data. We also perform a multi-wavelength
multi-messenger analysis by fitting simultaneously the radio flux on Vela YZ and Cygnus Loop and
the $e^+ + e^-$ flux, and checking the outputs against the $e^+ + e^-$ dipole anisotropy data. Remarkably,
we find a model which is compatible with all the $e^++e^-$ flux data, the radio data for Vela YZ and
Cygnus Loop, and with the anisotropy upper bounds. We show the severe constraints imposed by the
most recent data on the $e^+ + e^-$ dipole anisotropy.
