We carry out 2D viscous hydrodynamics simulations of circumbinary accretion using the moving-mesh
code AREPO. Our simulations resolve the accretion flow over a wide range of scales, from the large
circumbinary disk (CBD) to accretion streams and disks around individual binary components. Extending
our recent studies (Mu\~noz et al 2019), we consider circular binaries with various mass ratios
($0.4\leq q_b\leq 1$) and explore accretion from "infinite", steady-supply disks and from finite-sized,
viscously spreading tori. In the "infinite" disk case, a global steady state can be reached, and
we find that the accretion "eigenvalue" $l_0$, defined as the net angular momentum transfer from
the disk to the binary per unit accreted mass, is always positive and falls in the range ($0.65$-$0.75)a_{\rm
b}^2\Omega_{\rm b}$ (where $a_{\rm b}$, $\Omega_{\rm b}$ are the binary separation and angular
frequency), depending weakly on the mass ratio and disk viscosity. This positive $l_0$ leads to
expansion of the binary separation. Binary accretion from a finite torus can be separated into two
phases: an initial transient phase, corresponding to the filling of the binary cavity, followed
by a viscous pseudo-stationary phase, during which the torus viscously spreads and accretes onto
the binary. We find that, in the stationary viscous phase, the net torque on the binary per unit accreted
mass is close to the accretion "eigenvalue" $l_0$ derived for the steady-supply disks. We conclude
that in general, binaries accreting from circumbinary disks/tori gain angular momentum and expand
over long time scales. This result can significantly impact the evolution and coalescence of supermassive
binary black holes and newly formed binary stars. We offer a word of caution when drawing conclusions
from simulations of transient accretion onto empty circumbinary cavities.
