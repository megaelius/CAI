Gaia is regularly producing Alerts on objects where photometric variability has been detected.
The physical nature of these objects has often to be determined with the complementary observations
from ground-based facilities. We have compared the list of Gaia Alerts (until 20181101) with archival
LAMOST and SDSS spectroscopic data. The date of the ground-based observation rarely corresponds
to the date of the Alert, but this allows at least the identification of the source if it is persistent,
or the host galaxy if the object was only transient like a supernova. A list of Gaia Nuclear Transients
from Kostrzewa-Rutkowska et al. (2018) has been included in this search also. We found 26 Gaia Alerts
with spectra in LAMOST+SDSS labelled as stars (12 with multi-epoch spectra). A majority of them
are CVs. Similarly 206 Gaia Alerts have associated spectra labelled as galaxies (49 with multi-epoch
spectra). Those spectra were generally obtained on a date different from the Alert date, are mostly
emission-line galaxies, leading to the suspicion that most of the Alerts were due to a SN. As for the
GNT list, we found 55 associated spectra labelled as galaxies (13 with multi-epoch spectra). In
two galaxies, Gaia17aal and GNTJ170213+2543, was the date of the spectroscopic observation close
enough to the Alert date: we find a trace of the SN itself in their LAMOST spectrum, both classified
here as a type Ia SN. The GNT sample has a higher proportion of AGNs, suggesting that some of the detected
variations are also due to the AGN itself. Similar for Quasars, we found 30 Gaia Alerts but 68 GNT cases
have single epoch quasar spectra, while 12 plus 23 have multi-epoch spectra. For ten out of these
35, their multi-epoch spectra show appearance or disappearance of the broad Balmer lines and also
variations in the continuum, qualifying them as "Changing Look Quasars".
