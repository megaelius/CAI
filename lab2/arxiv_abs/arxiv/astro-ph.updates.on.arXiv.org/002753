Luminous infrared galaxies and submillimeter galaxies contribute significantly to stellar mass
assembly and the frequency of GRBs in these systems provides an important test of the connection
between the gamma-ray burst rate and that of overall cosmic star-formation. We present sensitive
3 GHz radio observations using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array of 32 uniformly-selected GRB host
galaxies spanning a redshift range from 0 < z < 2.5, providing the first fully dust- and sample-unbiased
measurement of the fraction of GRBs originating from the Universe's most bolometrically luminous
galaxies. Four galaxies are detected, with inferred radio star-formation rates ranging between
50-300 Msun/yr. Three of the four detections correspond to events consistent with being optically-obscured
"dark" bursts. Our overall detection fraction implies that between 9-23% of GRBs between 0.5 <
z < 2.5 occur in galaxies with S_3GHz > 10 uJy, corresponding to SFR >50 Msun/yr at z~1 or
>250 Msun/yr at z~2. Similar galaxies contribute approximately 10-30% of all cosmic star-formation,
so our results are consistent with a GRB rate which is not strongly biased with respect to the total
star-formation rate of a galaxy. However, all four radio-detected hosts have modest stellar masses
(~few x 10^10 Msun), significantly lower than IR/submillimeter-selected field galaxies of similar
luminosities. We suggest that the GRB rate may be suppressed in metal-rich environments but independently
enhanced in intense starbursts, producing a strong efficiency dependence on mass but little net
dependence on bulk galaxy star-formation rate.
