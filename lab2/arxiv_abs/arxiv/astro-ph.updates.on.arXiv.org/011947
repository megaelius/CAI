The goal of this work is to investigate Jupiter's growth focusing on the amount of heavy elements
accreted by the planet, and its comparison with recent structure models. Our model assumes an initial
core growth dominated by pebble accretion, and a second growth phase that is characterized by a moderate
accretion of both planetesimals and gas. The third phase is dominated by runaway gas accretion during
which the planet becomes detached from the disk. The second and third phases are computed in detail,
considering two different prescriptions for the planetesimal accretion and fits from hydrodynamical
studies to compute the gas accretion in the detached phase. In order for Jupiter to consist of $\sim$20-40
$M_{\oplus}$ of heavy elements as suggested by structure models, we find that Jupiter's formation
location is preferably at an orbital distance of $1\lesssim a \lesssim 10$ au once the accretion
of planetesimals dominates. We find that Jupiter could accrete between $\sim$1 and $\sim$15 $M_{\oplus}$
of heavy elements during runaway gas accretion, depending on the assumed initial surface density
of planetesimals and the prescription used to estimate the heavy-element accretion during the
final stage of the planetary formation. This would yield an envelope metallicity of $\sim$0.5 to
$\sim$3 times solar. By computing the solid accretion during the detached phase, we infer a planetary
mass-metallicity ($M_P$-$M_Z$) relation of $M_Z \sim M_P^{2/5}$ when a gap in the planetesimal
disk is created, and of $M_Z \sim M_P^{1/6}$ without a planetesimal gap. Our hybrid pebble-planetesimal
model can account for Jupiter's bulk and atmospheric enrichment. The high bulk metallicity inferred
for many giant exoplanets is difficult to explain from standard formation models. This might suggest
a migration history for such highly enriched giant exoplanets and/or giant impacts after the disk's
dispersal.
