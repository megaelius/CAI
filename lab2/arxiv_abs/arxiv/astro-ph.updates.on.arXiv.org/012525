We present new 850$\mu$m SCUBA-2 observations for a sample of 19 heavily reddened Type-I quasars
at redshifts $z\sim$2 with dust extinctions of A$_{\rm{V}} \simeq 2-6$ mag. Three of the 19 quasars
are detected at $>$3$\sigma$ significance corresponding to an 850$\mu$m flux-limit of $\gtrsim$4.8
mJy. Assuming the 850$\mu$m flux is dominated by dust heating due to star formation, very high star
formation rates (SFR) of $\sim$2500-4500 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ in the quasar host galaxies are inferred.
Even when considering a large contribution to the 850$\mu$m flux from dust heated by the quasar itself,
significant SFRs of $\sim$600-1500 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ are nevertheless inferred for two of the
three detected quasars. We stack the remaining 16 heavily reddened quasars and derive an average
3$\sigma$ upper limit on the SFRs in these quasar host galaxies of $<$880 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The
number counts of sub-mm galaxies in the total survey area (134.3arcmin$^2$) are consistent with
predictions from blank-field surveys. There are, however, individual quasars where we find evidence
for an excess of associated sub-mm galaxies. For two quasars, higher spatial resolution and spectroscopic
ALMA observations confirm the presence of an excess of sub-mm sources. We compare the 850$\mu$m
detection rate of our quasars to both unobscured, ultraviolet luminous quasars as well as the much
more obscured population of mid-infrared luminous Hot Dust Obscured Galaxies (HotDOGs). When
matched by luminosity and redshift, we find no significant differences in the 850$\mu$m flux densities
of these various quasar populations given the current small sample sizes.
