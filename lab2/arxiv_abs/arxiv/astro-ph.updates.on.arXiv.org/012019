Reverberation mapping technique is an important milestone in AGN demographics, kinematics and
the structure of the Broad Line Region (BLR) based on the time-delay response between the continuum
and emission line. The time delay is directly related to the size of BLR which is related to the continuum
luminosity of the source, producing the well-known Radius-Luminosity (RL) relation. The majority
of sources have been monitored for their H$\beta$ emission line in low redshift sources ($z<0.1$),
while there are some attempts using the MgII line for higher redshifts. We present a recent MgII monitoring
for the quasar CTS C30.10 ($z=0.90$) observed with the 10-meter SALT, for which RL scaling based
on MgII holds within measurement and time-delay uncertainties. One of the most important advantages
of reverberation mapping technique is the independent determination to the distant source, and
considering the large range of redshifts and luminosities found in AGNs, their application to cosmology
is promising. However, recently it has been found that highly accreting sources show the time delays
shorter than expected from RL relation. We propose correction for this effect using a sample of 117
H$\beta$ reverberating-mapped AGNs with $0.02<z<0.9$, recovering the low scatter along with
the relation. We are able to determine the cosmological constants, $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$
within 2$\sigma$ confidence level. We present the first steps in modelling of light curves for H$\beta$
and MgII and discuss the quasar selection in the context of photometric reverberation mapping with
Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). With the onset of the LSST era, we expect a huge rise in the
overall quasar counts and redshift range covered ($z\lesssim 7.0$), which will provide a better
constraint of AGN properties with cosmological purposes.
