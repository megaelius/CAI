The Traditional Approximation of Rotation (TAR) is a treatment of the dynamical equations of rotating
stably stratified fluids where the action of the Coriolis acceleration along the direction of the
entropy (and chemicals) stratification is neglected while assuming that the fluid motions are
mostly horizontal because of their inhibition in the vertical direction by the buoyancy force.
This leads to neglect the horizontal projection of the rotation vector in the equations for the dynamics
of gravito-inertial waves (GIWs) that become separable as in the non-rotating case while they are
not in the case with the full Coriolis acceleration. This approximation has been broadly applied
in stellar (and planetary) astrophysics to study low-frequency GIWs. TAR is built on the assumptions
that the star is spherical (i.e. its centrifugal deformation is neglected) and uniformly rotating
while an adiabatic treatment of the dynamics of the waves is adopted. However, it has been recently
generalised with including the effects of a differential rotation. We aim to do a new generalisation
that takes into account the centrifugal acceleration in the case of moderately uniformly rotating
deformed stars. As in the case of a differentially rotating spherical star, the problem becomes
2D but can be treated analytically if assuming the Cowling, anelastic and JWKB approximations,
which are relevant for low-frequency GIWs. It allows us to derive a generalised Laplace tidal equation
for the horizontal eigenfunctions and asymptotic wave periods that can be used to probe the structure
and dynamics of rotating deformed stars thanks to asteroseismology. A first numerical exploration
of its eigenvalues and horizontal eigenfunctions shows their variation as a function of the pseudo-radius
for different rotation rates and frequencies and the development of avoided crossings.
