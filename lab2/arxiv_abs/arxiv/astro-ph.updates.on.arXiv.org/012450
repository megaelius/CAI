The N$_2$ and CO-rich and water-depleted comet C/2016 R2 (Pan-STARRS) (hereafter `C/2016 R2')
is a unique comet for detailed spectroscopic analysis. We aim to explore the associated photochemistry
of parent species, which produces different metastable states and forbidden emissions, in this
cometary coma of peculiar composition. We re-analyzed the high-resolution spectra of comet C/2016
R2, which were obtained in February 2018, using the UVES spectrograph of the European Southern Observatory
(ESO) Very Large Telescope (VLT). Various forbidden atomic emission lines of [CI], [NI], and [OI]
were observed in the optical spectrum of this comet when it was at 2.8 au from the Sun. The observed
forbidden emission intensity ratios are studied in the framework of a couple-chemistry emission
model. The model calculations show that CO$_2$ is the major source of both atomic oxygen green and
red-doublet emissions in the coma of C/2016 R2 (while for most comets it is generally H$_2$O), whereas,
CO and N$_2$ govern the atomic carbon and nitrogen emissions, respectively. Our modelled oxygen
green to red-doublet and carbon to nitrogen emission ratios are higher by a factor {of 3}, when compared
to the observations. These discrepancies can be due to uncertainties associated with photon cross
sections or unknown production/loss sources. Our modelled oxygen green to red-doublet emission
ratio is close to the observations, when we consider an O$_2$ abundance with a production rate of
30\% relative to the CO production rate. The collisional quenching is not a significant loss process
for N($^2$D) though its radiative lifetime is significant ($\sim$10 hrs). Hence, the observed
[NI] doublet-emission ratio ([NI] 5198/5200) of 1.22, which is smaller than the terrestrial measurement
by a factor {1.4}, is mainly due to the characteristic radiative decay of N($^2$D).
