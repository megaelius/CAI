Massive stars in binary systems have long been regarded as potential sources of high-energy gamma
rays.The emission is principally thought to arise in the region where the stellar winds collide
and accelerate relativistic particles which ubsequently emit gamma rays. On the basis of a three-dimensional
distribution function of high-energy particles in the wind collision region - as obtained by a numerical
hydrodynamics and particle transport model - we present the computation of the three-dimensional
nonthermal photon emission for a given line of sight. Anisotropic inverse Compton emission is modelled
using the target radiation field of both stars. Photons from relativistic bremsstrahlung and neutral
pion decay are computed on the basis of local wind plasma densities. We also consider photon photon
opacity effects due to the dense radiation fields of the stars. Results are shown for different stellar
separations of a given binary system comprising of a B star and a Wolf-Rayet star. The influence of
orbital orientation with respect to the line of sight is also studied by using different orbital
viewing angles. For the chosen electron-proton injection ratio of 0.01, we present the ensuing
photon emission in terms of two-dimensional projections maps, spectral energy distributions
and integrated photon flux values in various energy bands. Here, we find a transition from hadron-dominated
to lepton-dominated high-energy emission with increasing stellar separations. In addition,
we confirm findings from previous analytic modeling that the spectral energy distribution varies
significantly with orbital orientation.
