On August 17, 2017, the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors observed
a low-mass compact binary inspiral. The initial sky localization of the source of the gravitational-wave
signal, GW170817, allowed electromagnetic observatories to identify NGC 4993 as the host galaxy.
In this work we improve initial estimates of the binary's properties, including component masses,
spins, and tidal parameters, using the known source location, improved modeling, and re-calibrated
Virgo data. We extend the range of gravitational-wave frequencies considered down to 23 Hz, compared
to 30 Hz in the initial analysis. We also compare results inferred using several signal models, which
are more accurate and incorporate additional physical effects as compared to the initial analysis.
We improve the localization of the gravitational-wave source to a 90% credible region of $16~\mathrm{deg}^2$.
We find tighter constraints on the masses, spins, and tidal parameters, and continue to find no evidence
for non-zero component spins. The component masses are inferred to lie between 1.00 and 1.89 $M_\odot$
when allowing for large component spins, and to lie between 1.16 and 1.60 $M_\odot$ (with a total
mass $2.73^{+0.04}_{-0.01} \, M_\odot$) when the spins are restricted to be within the range observed
in Galactic binary neutron stars. Under minimal assumptions about the nature of the compact objects,
our constraints for the tidal deformability parameter $\tilde \Lambda$ are $(0,630)$ when we allow
for large component spins, and $300^{+420}_{-230}$ (using a 90% highest posterior density interval)
when restricting the magnitude of the component spins, ruling out several equation of state models
at the 90% credible level. Finally, with LIGO and GEO600 data, we use a Bayesian analysis to place
upper limits on the amplitude and spectral energy density of a possible post-merger signal. (Abridged)
