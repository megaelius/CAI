We provide a new interpretation for the Bayes factor combination used in the Dark Energy Survey (DES)
first year analysis to quantify the tension between the DES and Planck datasets. The ratio quantifies
a Bayesian confidence in our ability to combine the datasets. This interpretation is prior-dependent,
with wider prior widths boosting the confidence. We therefore propose that if there are any reasonable
priors which reduce the confidence to below unity, then we cannot assert that the datasets are compatible.
Computing the evidence ratios for the DES first year analysis and Planck, given that narrower priors
drop the confidence to below unity, we conclude that DES and Planck are, in a Bayesian sense, incompatible
under LCDM. Additionally we compute ratios which confirm the consensus that measurements of the
acoustic scale by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (SDSS) are compatible with Planck,
whilst direct measurements of the acceleration rate of the Universe by the SHOES collaboration
are not. We propose a modification to the Bayes ratio which removes the prior dependency using Kullback-Leibler
divergences, and using this statistical test find Planck in strong tension with SHOES, in moderate
tension with DES, and in no tension with SDSS. We propose this statistic as the optimal way to compare
datasets, ahead of the next DES data releases, as well as future surveys. Finally, as an element of
these calculations, we introduce in a cosmological setting the Bayesian model dimensionality,
which is a parameterisation-independent measure of the number of parameters that a given dataset
constrains.
