Recent studies have shown that atmospheric mass-loss powered by the cooling luminosity of a planet's
core can explain the observed radius valley separating super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, even without
photoevaporation. In this work, we investigate the dependence of this core-powered mass-loss
mechanism on stellar mass ($M_\ast$), metallicity ($Z_\ast$) and age ($\tau_\ast$). Without
making any changes to the underlying planet population, we find that the core-powered mass-loss
model yields a shift in the radius valley to larger planet sizes around more massive stars with a slope
given by $\text{d log}R_p/\text{d log}M_\ast \simeq 0.35$, in agreement with observations. To
first order, this slope is driven by the dependence of core-powered mass-loss on the bolometric
luminosity of the host star and is given by $\text{d log}R_p/\text{d log}M_\ast \simeq (3\alpha-2)/36
\simeq 0.33$, where $(L_\ast/L_\odot) = (M_\ast/M_\odot)^\alpha$ is the stellar mass-luminosity
relation and $\alpha\simeq 4.6$ for the CKS dataset. We therefore find, in contrast to photoevaporation
models, no evidence for a linear correlation between planet and stellar mass, but can't rule it out
either. In addition, we show that the location of the radius valley is, to first order, independent
of stellar age and metallicity. Since core-powered mass-loss proceeds over Gyr timescales, the
abundance of super-Earths relative to sub-Neptunes increases with age but decreases with stellar
metallicity. Finally, due the dependence of the envelope's cooling timescale on metallicity,
we find that the radii of sub-Neptunes increase with metallicity and decrease with age with slopes
given by $\text{d log}R_p/\text{d log}Z_\ast \simeq 0.1$ and $\text{d log}R_p/\text{d log}\tau_\ast
\simeq -0.1$, respectively. We conclude with a series of observational tests that can differentiate
between core-powered mass-loss and photoevaporation models.
