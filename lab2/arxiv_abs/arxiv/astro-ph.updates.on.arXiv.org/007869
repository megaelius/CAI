With upcoming (continuum) surveys of high-resolution radio telescopes, detection rates of fast
radio bursts (FRBs) might approach $10^5$ per sky per day by future extremely large observatories,
such as the possible extension of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) to a phase 2 array. Depending on
the redshift distribution of FRBs and using the repeating FRB121102 as a model, we calculate a detection
rate of multiply-imaged FRBs with their multiply-imaged hosts caused by the distribution of galaxy-cluster
scale gravitational lenses of the order of $10^{-4}$ per square degree per year for a minimum total
flux of the host of 10 $\mu$Jy at 1.4 GHz for SKA phase 2. Our comparison of estimated detection rates
for quasars, supernovae, gamma ray bursts, and FRBs shows that multiple images of FRBs could be more
numerous than those of gamma ray bursts and supernovae and as numerous as multiple images of quasars.
Time delays between the multiple images of an FRB break degeneracies in model-based and model-independent
lens reconstructions as other time-varying sources do, yet without a microlensing bias as FRBs
are more point-like and have shorter duration times. We estimate the relative imprecision of FRB
time-delay measurements to be $10^{-10}$ for time delays on the order of 100 days for galaxy-cluster
scale lenses, yielding more precise (local) lens properties than time delays from the other time-varying
sources. Using the lens modelling software Grale, we show the increase in accuracy and precision
of the reconstructed scaled surface mass density map of a simulated cluster-scale lens when adding
time delays for one set of multiple images to the set of observational constraints.
