We present our analysis of high-resolution (R $\sim$ 20 000) GTC/MEGARA integral-field unit spectroscopic
observations, obtained during the commissioning run, in the inner region (12.5 arcsec x 11.3 arcsec)
of the active galaxy NGC7469, at spatial scales of 0.62 arcsec. We explore the kinematics, dynamics,
ionisation mechanisms and oxygen abundances of the ionised gas, by modelling the H$\alpha$-[NII]
emission lines at high signal-to-noise (>15) with multiple Gaussian components. MEGARA observations
reveal, for the first time for NGC7469, the presence of a very thin (20 pc) ionised gas disc supported
by rotation (V/$\sigma$ = 4.3), embedded in a thicker (222 pc), dynamically hotter (V/$\sigma$
= 1.3) one. These discs nearly co-rotate with similar peak-to-peak velocities (163 vs. 137 km/s
), but with different average velocity dispersion (38 vs. 108 km/s ). The kinematics of both discs
could be possibly perturbed by star-forming regions. We interpret the morphology and the kinematics
of a third (broader) component ($\sigma$ > 250 km/s) as suggestive of the presence of non-rotational
turbulent motions possibly associated either to an outflow or to the lense. For the narrow component,
the [NII]/H$\alpha$ ratios point to the star-formation as the dominant mechanism of ionisation,
being consistent with ionisation from shocks in the case of the intermediate component. All components
have roughly solar metallicity. In the nuclear region of NGC7469, at r < 1.85 arcsec, a very broad
(FWHM = 2590 km/s ) H{\alpha} component is contributing (41%) to the global H$\alpha$ -[NII]profile,
being originated in the (unresolved) broad line region of the Seyfert 1.5 nucleus of NGC7469.
