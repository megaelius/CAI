Cosmological surveys aim to use the evolution of the abundance of galaxy clusters to accurately
constrain the cosmological model. In the context of LCDM, we show that it is possible to achieve the
required percent level accuracy in the halo mass function with gravity-only cosmological simulations,
and we provide simulation start and run parameter guidelines for doing so. Some previous works have
had sufficient statistical precision, but lacked robust verification of absolute accuracy. Convergence
tests of the mass function with, for example, simulation start redshift can exhibit false convergence
of the mass function due to counteracting errors, potentially misleading one to infer overly optimistic
estimations of simulation accuracy. Percent level accuracy is possible if initial condition particle
mapping uses second order Lagrangian Perturbation Theory, and if the start epoch is between 10 and
50 expansion factors before the epoch of halo formation of interest. The mass function for halos
with fewer than ~1000 particles is highly sensitive to simulation parameters and start redshift,
implying a practical minimum mass resolution limit due to mass discreteness. The narrow range in
converged start redshift suggests that it is not presently possible for a single simulation to capture
accurately the cluster mass function while also starting early enough to model accurately the numbers
of reionisation era galaxies, whose baryon feedback processes may affect later cluster properties.
Ultimately, to fully exploit current and future cosmological surveys will require accurate modeling
of baryon physics and observable properties, a formidable challenge for which accurate gravity-only
simulations are just an initial step.
