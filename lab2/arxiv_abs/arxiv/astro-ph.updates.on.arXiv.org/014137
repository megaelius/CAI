The discovery of the donor magnetic field has repeatedly posed the task of a thorough study of the
phenomenon, which is based on the concept of the influence of the magnetic field on the processes
of the formation of gaseous structures and mass transfer in the Beta Lyrae system. This article provides
an overview, analysis, and synthesis of the results of a variety of long-term observations as a necessary
basis for further clarification of issues aimed primarily at the study of magnetized gaseous structures.
As a part of such a study, it was found that the structure of the gaseous flows between the donor and
the gainer varies in some way depending on the phases of the orbital period; and, accordingly, that
the donor magnetic field influences the formation of these moving magnetized structures. The analysis
of the masses of both components for use in further scientific works suggests that the following
values are optimal: 2.9 M_sun for the donor and 13 M_sun for the gainer. The study of satellite lines
as a certain phenomenon leads to the fact that the accretion disk surrounding the gainer consists
of two parts: the external satellite disk and the internal massive opaque disk. From the analysis
of all observations and studies of the magnetic field, observations on the 6-m telescope can be considered
the most reliable. They have formed the spatial configuration of the donor magnetic field, which
is important for studying and understanding the features of the mass transfer in this interacting
system. Further evidence regarding the picture of the magnetized accretion structures as the special
phenomenon will be presented in the following articles.
