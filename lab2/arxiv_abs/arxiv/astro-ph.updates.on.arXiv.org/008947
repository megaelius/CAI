We present adaptive optics assisted integral field spectroscopy of 34 star-forming galaxies at
$z$ = 0.8-3.3 selected from the HiZELS narrow-band survey. We measure the kinematics of the ionised
interstellar medium on $\sim$1 kpc scales, and show that the galaxies are turbulent, with a median
ratio of rotational to dispersion support of $v$/$\sigma$=0.82$\pm$0.13. We combine the dynamics
with high-resolution rest-frame optical imaging and extract emission line rotation curves. We
show that high-redshift star forming galaxies follow a similar power-law trend in specific angular
momentum with stellar mass as that of local late type galaxies. We exploit the high resolution of
our data and examine the radial distribution of angular momentum within each galaxy by constructing
total angular momentum profiles. Although the stellar mass of a typical star-forming galaxy is
expected to grow by a factor $\sim$8 in the $\sim$5 Gyrs between $z$$\sim$3.3 and $z$$\sim$0.8,
we show that the internal distribution of angular momentum becomes less centrally concentrated
in this period i.e the angular momentum grows outwards. To interpret our observations, we exploit
the EAGLE simulation and trace the angular momentum evolution of star forming galaxies from $z$$\sim$3
to $z$$\sim$0, identifying a similar trend of decreasing angular momentum concentration. This
change is attributed to a combination of gas accretion in the outer disk, and feedback that preferentially
arises from the central regions of the galaxy. We discuss how the combination of the growing bulge
and angular momentum stabilises the disk and gives rise to the Hubble sequence.
