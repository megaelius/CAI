We explore the implications of seasonal variability for the transitions of Earth-like planets
to and from Snowball states as determined by the two parameters polar obliquity and orbital eccentricity
using a general circulation model of intermediate complexity. Our results show that planets with
Earth-like atmospheres and high seasonal variability can be partially ice-free at much greater
distance from the host star than planets without seasonal variability. While obliquity has a relatively
small effect on circular orbits, it becomes highly relevant for planets on eccentric orbits. This
effect of seasonal variability on habitability is primarily due to regions that are ice-free only
at some time of the year, which asks for a clear distinction between different degrees of habitability.
Moreover, our results show that seasonal variability also affects bistability, i.e. the existence
of both a warm and a cold climate state. For planets with low obliquity, bistability is found well
within the habitable zone. On planets with high obliquity, seasonal variability can allow for ice-
free regions even in a cold climate state. Sensitivity experiments exploring the role of azimuthal
obliquity, surface heat capacity, and maximal sea-ice thickness show the robustness of our results.
On circular orbits, our results obtained with a general circulation model are in good agreement
with previous studies based on one dimensional energy balance models, whereas large differences
are found on eccentric orbits. We attribute these differences to limitations of simpler models,
which underlines the importance of using a hierarchy of models in order to provide reliable estimates
of the effects of seasonal variability on climate.
