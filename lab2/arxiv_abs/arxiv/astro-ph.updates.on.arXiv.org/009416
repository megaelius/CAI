Context: The determination of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) of massive galaxies is one
of the open problems in cosmology. Strong gravitational lensing is one of the few methods that allow
us to constrain the IMF at cosmological distances. Aims: The goal of this study is to statistically
constrain the distribution in the IMF mismatch parameter, defined as the ratio between the true
stellar mass of a galaxy and that inferred assuming a reference IMF, of massive galaxies from the
BOSS CMASS sample. Methods: We take 23 strong lenses drawn from the CMASS sample, measure their Einstein
radii and stellar masses using multi-band photometry from HSC, then fit a model distribution for
the IMF mismatch parameter and dark matter halo mass to the whole sample. We use a prior on halo mass
from weak lensing measurements and account for strong lensing selection effects in our model. Results:
Assuming an NFW density profile for the dark matter distribution, we infer a value $\mu_{\mathrm{IMF}}
= -0.04\pm0.11$ for the average base-10 logarithm of the IMF mismatch parameter, defined with respect
to a Chabrier IMF. A Salpeter IMF is in tension with our measurements. Conclusions: Our results are
consistent with a scenario in which the region of massive galaxies where the IMF normalization is
significantly heavier than that of the Milky Way is much smaller than the scales $5\sim10$ kpc probed
by the Einstein radius of the lenses in our sample, as recent spatially resolved studies of the IMF
in massive galaxies suggest. The MCMC chains describing the posterior probability distribution
of the model are available online, together with the code used to obtain them.
