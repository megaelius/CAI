While accreting through a circumstellar disk, young stellar objects are observed to undergo sudden
and powerful accretion events known as FUor or EXor outbursts. Although such episodic accretion
is considered to be an integral part of the star formation process, the triggers and mechanisms behind
them remain uncertain. We conducted global numerical hydrodynamics simulations of protoplanetary
disk formation and evolution in the thin-disk limit, assuming both magnetically layered and fully
magnetorotational instability (MRI)-active disk structure. In this paper, we characterize the
nature of the outbursts occurring in these simulations. The instability in the dead zone of a typical
layered disk results in "MRI outbursts". We explore their progression and their dependence on the
layered disk parameters as well as cloud core mass. The simulations of fully MRI-active disks showed
an instability analogous to the classical thermal instability. This instability manifested at
two temperatures--above approximately 1400 K and 3500 K--due to the steep dependence of Rosseland
opacity on the temperature. The origin of these thermally unstable regions is related to the bump
in opacity resulting from molecular absorption by water vapor and may be viewed as a novel mechanism
behind some of the shorter duration accretion events. Although we demonstrated local thermal instability
in the disk, more investigations are needed to confirm that a large-scale global instability will
ensue. We conclude that the magnetic structure of a disk, its composition, as well as the stellar
mass, can significantly affect the nature of episodic accretion in young stellar objects.
