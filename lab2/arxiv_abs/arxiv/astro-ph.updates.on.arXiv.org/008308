The geometry of the accretion flow around stellar-mass black holes can change on timescales of days
to months. When a black hole emerges from quiescence (that is, it "turns on" after accreting material
from its companion) it has a very hard (high-energy) X-ray spectrum produced by a hot corona positioned
above its accretion disk, and then transitions to a soft (lower-energy) spectrum dominated by emission
from the geometrically thin accretion disk, which extends to the innermost stable circular orbit.
Much debate persists over how this transition occurs and whether it is driven largely by a reduction
in the truncation radius of the disk or by a reduction in the spatial extent of the corona. Observations
of X-ray reverberation lags in supermassive black-hole systems suggest that the corona is compact
and that the disk extends nearly to the central black hole. Observations of stellar-mass black holes,
however, reveal equivalent (mass-scaled) reverberation lags that are much larger, leading to
the suggestion that the accretion disk in the hard X-ray state of stellar-mass black holes is truncated
at a few hundreds of gravitational radii from the black hole. Here we report X-ray observations of
the black-hole transient MAXI J1820+070. We find that the reverberation time lags between the continuum-emitting
corona and the irradiated accretion disk are 6 to 20 times shorter than previously seen. The timescale
of the reverberation lags shortens by an order of magnitude over a period of weeks, whereas the shape
of the broadened iron K emission line remains remarkably constant. This suggests a reduction in
the spatial extent of the corona, rather than a change in the inner edge of the accretion disk.
