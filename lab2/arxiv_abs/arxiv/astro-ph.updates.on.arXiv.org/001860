The baryon cycle of galaxies is a dynamic process involving the intake, consumption and ejection
of vast quantities of gas. In contrast, the conventional picture of satellite galaxies has them
methodically turning a large gas reservoir into stars until this reservoir is forcibly removed
due to external ram pressure. This picture needs revision. Our modern understanding of the baryon
cycle suggests that in some regimes the simple interruption of the fresh gas supply may quench satellite
galaxies long before stripping events occur, a process we call overconsumption. We compile measurements
from the literature of observed satellite quenching times at a range of redshifts to determine if
satellites are principally quenched through orbit-based gas stripping events -- either direct
stripping of the disk (ram pressure stripping) or the extended gas halo (strangulation) -- or from
internally-driven star formation outflows via overconsumption. The observed timescales show
significant deviation from the evolution expected for gas stripping mechanisms and suggest that
either ram pressure stripping is much more efficient at high redshift, or that secular outflows
quench satellites before orbit-based stripping occurs. Given the strong redshift evolution of
star formation rates, at high redshift (z > 1.5) even moderate outflow rates will lead to extremely
short quenching times with the expectation that such satellites will be quenched almost immediately
following the cessation of cosmological inflow, regardless of stripping events. Observations
of high redshift satellites give an indirect but sensitive measure of the outflow rate with current
measurements suggesting that outflows are no larger than 2.5 times the star formation rate for galaxies
with a stellar mass of 10^{10.5} solar masses.
