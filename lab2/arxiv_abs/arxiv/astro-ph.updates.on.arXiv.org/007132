We present a multi-wavelength analysis of the four most relaxed clusters in the South Pole Telescope
2500 deg^2 survey, which lie at 0.55 < z < 0.75. This study, which utilizes new, deep data from Chandra
and Hubble, along with ground-based spectroscopy from Gemini and Magellan, improves significantly
on previous studies in both depth and angular resolution, allowing us to directly compare to clusters
at z~0. We find that the temperature, density, and entropy profiles of the intracluster medium (ICM)
are very similar among the four clusters, and share similar shapes to clusters at z~0. Specifically,
we find no evidence for deviations from self similarity in the temperature profile over the radial
range 10kpc < r < 1Mpc, implying that the processes responsible for preventing runaway cooling over
the past >6 Gyr are, at least roughly, preserving self similarity. We find typical metallicities
of ~0.3 Zsun in the bulk of the ICM, rising to ~0.5 Zsun in the inner ~100 kpc, and reaching ~1 Zsun at
r < 10kpc. This central excess is similar in magnitude to what is observed in the most relaxed clusters
at z~0, suggesting that both the global metallicity and the central excess that we see in cool core
clusters at z~0 were in place very early in the cluster lifetime and, specifically, that the central
excess is not due to late-time enrichment by the central galaxy. Consistent with observations at
z~0, we measure a diversity of stellar populations in the central brightest cluster galaxies of
these four clusters, with star formation rates spanning a factor of ~500, despite the similarity
in cooling time, cooling rate, and central entropy. These data suggest that, while the details vary
dramatically from system to system, runaway cooling has been broadly regulated in relaxed clusters
over the past 6 Gyr.
