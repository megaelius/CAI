In weakly collisional stellar systems such as some globular clusters, partial energy equipartition
and mass segregation are expected to develop as a result of the cumulative effect of stellar encounters
even in systems initially characterized by star-mass independent density and energy distributions.
In parallel, numerical simulations have demonstrated that radially-biased pressure anisotropy
slowly builds up in realistic models of globular clusters from initial isotropic conditions, leading
to anisotropy profiles that, to some extent, mimic those resulting from incomplete violent relaxation
known to be relevant to elliptical galaxies. In this paper we consider a set of realistic simulations
realized by means of Monte Carlo methods and analyze them by means of self-consistent two-component
models. For the purpose, we refer to an underlying distribution function, originally conceived
to describe elliptical galaxies, that has been recently truncated and adapted to the context of
globular clusters. The two components are meant to represent light stars (combining all main sequence
stars) and heavy stars (giants, dark remnants, and binaries). We show that this conceptually simple
family of two-component truncated models provides a reasonable description of simulated density,
velocity dispersion, and anisotropy profiles, especially for the most relaxed systems, with the
capability to express quantitatively the attained levels of energy equipartition and mass segregation.
In contrast, two-component isotropic models based on the King distribution function do not offer
a comparably satisfactory representation of the simulated globular clusters. With this work we
provide a new reliable diagnostic tool applicable to nonrotating globular clusters that are characterized
by significant gradients in the local value of the mass-to-light ratio, beyond the commonly used
one-component dynamical models.
