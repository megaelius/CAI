We explore the abundance, spatial distribution, and physical properties of the OVI, OVII, and OVIII
ions of oxygen in circumgalactic and intergalactic media (the CGM, IGM, and WHIM). We use the TNG100
and TNG300 large volume cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations. Modeling the ionization
states of simulated oxygen, we find good agreement with observations of the low-redshift OVI column
density distribution function (CDDF), and present its evolution for all three ions from z=0 to z=4.
Producing mock quasar absorption line spectral surveys, we show that the IllustrisTNG simulations
are fully consistent with constraints on the OVI content of the CGM from COS-Halos and other low redshift
observations, producing columns as high as observed. We measure the total amount of mass and average
column densities of each ion using hundreds of thousands of simulated galaxies spanning 10^11 <
Mhalo/Msun < 10^15 corresponding to 10^9 < M*/Msun < 10^12 in stellar mass. The stacked radial profiles
of OVI around halos of different masses are computed in 3D number density as well as 2D projected column,
decomposing into the 1-halo and 2-halo terms, the latter of which begins to dominate for Milky Way
mass halos in the WHIM just beyond the virial radius. Relating halo OVI to properties of the central
galaxy, we find a correlation between the (g-r) color of a galaxy and the total amount of OVI in its
CGM. In comparison to the COS-Halos finding, this leads to a dichotomy of columns around star-forming
versus passive galaxies at fixed stellar (or halo) mass. We demonstrate that this correlation is
a direct result of blackhole feedback associated with quenching, which also produces additional
trends with other galaxy properties, and represents a causal consequence of galactic-scale baryonic
feedback impacting the physical state of the circumgalactic medium.
