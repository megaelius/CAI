700 $\delta$ Scuti pulsating stars were observed by LAMOST by November 30, 2016. Stellar atmospheric
parameters of 463 variables were determined, while spectral types were obtained for all samples.
In the paper, those spectroscopic data are catalogued. We present a group of 113 unusual and cool
variable stars (UCVs) that are distinguished from the normal $\delta$ Scuti stars (NDSTs). On the
H-R diagram and the $\log g-T$ diagram, the UCVs are far beyond the red edge of pulsational instability
trip. Their effective temperatures are lower than 6700 K with periods in the range from 0.09 to 0.22
days. NDSTs have metallicity close to that of the Sun as expected, while UCVs are more metal poor than
NDSTs. It is shown that those UCVs may not belong to $\delta$ Scuti stars because their pulsation
constants (Q) are usually higher than 0.033 days. The two peaks on the distributions of the period,
the temperature, the gravitational acceleration, and the metallicity are all caused by the existence
of UCVs. When those UCVs are excluded, it is discovered that the effective temperature, the gravitational
acceleration and the metallicity all are correlated with the pulsating period for NDSTs and their
physical properties and evolutionary states are discussed. The detecting of those UCVs indicates
that about 24% of the known $\delta$ Scuti stars were misclassified and some in the period range from
0.09 to 0.22 days should be reclassified. If some of them are confirmed to be pulsating stars, they
will be a new-type pulsators and their investigations will shed light on theoretical instability
domains and on the theories of interacting between the pulsation and the convection of solar-type
stars. Meanwhile, 64 $\delta$ Scuti stars are detected to be the candidates of binary or multiple
systems.
