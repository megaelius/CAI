We use deep, $\mu_{r} \lesssim 28\,\text{mag}\,\text{arcsec}^{-2}$, $r$-band imaging from
the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) to search for past, or ongoing, merger activity in
a sample of $282$ Low Excitation Radio Galaxies (LERGs) at $z<0.07$. Our principle aim is to assess
the the role of mergers in the evolution of LERGs. Exploiting the imaging depth, we classify tidal
remnants around galaxies as both minor and major morphological disturbances for our LERG sample
and $1,622$ control galaxies matched in redshift, stellar mass, and environment. In groups and
in the field, the LERG minor merger fraction is consistent with the control population. In galaxy
clusters, $8.8 \pm 2.9\,$ % of LERGs show evidence of recent minor mergers in contrast to $23.0\pm
2.0\,$ % of controls. This $\sim 4 \sigma $ deficit of minor mergers in cluster LERGs suggests these
events may inhibit this type of nuclear activity for galaxies within the cluster environment. We
observe a $> 4\sigma$ excess of major mergers in the LERGs with $M_{*} \lesssim 10^{11}\,\text{M}_{\odot}$,
with $10 \pm 1.5\,$ % of these AGN involved in such large-scale interactions compared to $3.2 \pm
0.4\,$% of control galaxies. This excess of major mergers in LERGs decreases with increasing stellar
mass, vanishing by $M_{*} > 10^{11.3}\,\text{M}_{\odot}$. These observations show that minor
mergers do not fuel LERGs, and are consistent with typical LERGs being powered by accretion of matter
from their halo. Where LERGs are associated with major mergers, these objects may evolve into more
efficiently accreting active galactic nuclei as the merger progresses and more gas falls on to the
central engine.
