The Fermi Large Area Telescope revealed that the extragalactic gamma-ray sky is dominated by blazars,
active galactic nuclei (AGN) whose jet is seen at very small angle to the line of sight. To associate
and then classify the gamma-ray sources, data have been collected from lower frequency surveys
and observations. The gamma-ray source 3FGL J1323.0+2942 is associated with the radio source 4C+29.48
and classified as a blazar of unknown type, lacking optical spectrum and redshift. The higher-resolution
radio data showed that 4C+29.48 comprises three bright radio-emitting features located within
a ~1'-diameter area. We (re-)analyzed archival Very Large Array and unpublished very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI) observations conducted by the Very Long Baseline Array and the European
VLBI Network of 4C+29.48. We also collected data form optical, infrared and X-ray surveys. The northernmost
complex of 4C+29.48 contains a blazar with a high brightness temperature compact core and a steep-spectrum
jet feature. The blazar is positionally coincident with an optical source at a redshift of 1.142.
Its mid-infrared colors also support its association with a gamma-ray emitting blazar. The two
other radio complexes have steep radio spectra and do not have optical or infrared counterparts
in currently available surveys. Based on the radio morphology, they are unlikely to be related to
the blazar. We discuss the possibilities whether the two radio features are lobes of a radio galaxy,
or gravitationally lensed images of a background source. We propose to associate 3FGL J1323.0+2942
in subsequent versions of the Fermi catalog with the blazar residing in northernmost complex. We
suggest naming this source J1323+2941A to avoid misinterpretation arising from the fact that the
coordinates of the currently listed radio counterpart 4C+29.48 is closer to a most probably unrelated
radio source. (abridged)
