[Abridged] With a growing number of molecules observed in many comets, and an improved understanding
of chemical evolution in protoplanetary disk midplanes, comparisons can be made between models
and observations that could potentially constrain the formation histories of comets. A $\chi^{2}$-method
was used to determine maximum likelihood surfaces for 14 different comets that formed at a given
time (up to 8 Myr) and place (out to beyond the CO iceline) in the pre-solar nebula midplane. This was
done using observed volatile abundances for the 14 comets and the evolution of volatile abundances
from chemical modelling of disk midplanes. Considering all parent species (ten molecules) in a
scenario that assumed reset initial chemistry, the $\chi^{2}$ likelihood surfaces show a characteristic
trail in the parameter space with high likelihood of formation around 30 AU at early times and 12 AU
at later times for ten comets. This trail roughly traces the vicinity of the CO iceline in time. The
formation histories for all comets were thereby constrained to the vicinity of the CO iceline, assuming
that the chemistry was partially reset early in the pre-solar nebula. This is found, both when considering
carbon-, oxygen-, and sulphur-bearing molecules (ten in total), and when only considering carbon-
and oxygen-bearing molecules (seven in total). Since these 14 comets did not previously fall into
the same taxonomical categories together, this chemical constraint may be proposed as an alternative
taxonomy for comets. Based on the most likely time for each of these comets to have formed during the
disk chemical evolution, a formation time classification for the 14 comets is suggested.
