Predictions of solar cycle 24 obtained from advection-dominated and diffusion-dominated kinematic
dynamo models are different if the Babcock-Leighton mechanism is the only source of the poloidal
field. Yeates et al. (2008) argue that the discrepancy arises due to different memories of the solar
dynamo for advection- and diffusion-dominated solar convection zones. We aim to investigate the
differences in solar cycle memory obtained from advection-dominated and diffusion-dominated
kinematic solar dynamo models. Specifically, we explore whether the inclusion of Parker's mean-field
$\alpha$ effect, in addition to the Babcock-Leighton mechanism, has any impact on the memory of
the solar cycle. We used a kinematic flux transport solar dynamo model where poloidal field generation
takes place due to both the Babcock-Leighton mechanism and the mean-field $\alpha$ effect. We additionally
considered stochastic fluctuations in this model and explored cycle-to-cycle correlations between
the polar field at the minima and toroidal field at cycle maxima. Solar dynamo memory is always limited
to only one cycle in diffusion-dominated dynamo regimes while in advection-dominated regimes
the memory is distributed over a few solar cycles. However, the addition of a mean-field alpha effect
reduces the memory of the solar dynamo to within one cycle in the advection-dominated dynamo regime
when there are no fluctuations in the mean-field $\alpha$ effect. When fluctuations are introduced
in the mean-field poloidal source a more complex scenario is evident, with very weak but significant
correlations emerging across a few cycles. Our results imply that inclusion of a mean-field alpha
effect in the framework of a flux transport Babcock-Leighton dynamo model leads to additional complexities
that may impact memory and predictability of predictive dynamo models of the solar cycle.
