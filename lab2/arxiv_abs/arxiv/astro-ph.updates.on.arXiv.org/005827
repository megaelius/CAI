In this paper, we simulate the Super-Eddington Accreting Massive Black Holes (SEAMBHs) as the candles
to probe the cosmology for the first time. SEAMBHs have been demonstrated that they can provide a
new tool for estimating cosmological distance. Thus we create a series of mock data sets of SEAMBHs
specially in hight redshift region to check the abilities of them on probing the cosmology. To fulfill
the potential of the SEAMBHs on the cosmology, we apply the simulated data to three projects. The
first is exploring their abilities to constrain the cosmological parameters, in which we combine
different data sets of current observations such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from
{\it Planck} and type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from Joint Light-curve Analysis (JLA). We find that
the high redshift SEAMBHs can help to break the degeneracies of the background cosmological parameters
constrained by {\it Planck} and JLA, thus give a much tighter constraints of the cosmological parameters.
The second is using the high redshift SEAMBHs as the complements of the low redshift JLA to constrain
the early expansion rate and the dark energy density evolution in the cold dark matter frame. Our
results show that these high redshift SEAMBHs are very powerful on constraining the early Hubble
rate and the evolution of the dark energy density, thus can give us more information of the expansion
history of our Universe, which is also crucial for the test of $\Lambda$CDM model in high redshift
region. Finally, we check the SEAMBHs candles' abilities to reconstruct the equation of state of
dark energy at high redshift. In summary, our results show that the SEAMBHs, as the rare candles in
high redshift region, can provide us a new and independent observation to probe the cosmology in
the future.
