We present a detailed study of the collapse of a spherical matter overdensity and the non-linear
growth of large scale structures in the Galileon ghost condensate (GGC) model. This model is an extension
of the cubic covariant Galileon (G3) which includes a field derivative of type $(\nabla_\mu\phi\nabla^\mu\phi)^2$
in the Lagrangian. We find that the cubic term activates the modifications in the main physical quantities
and the additional term has an extended impact in the evolution of the latter. The GGC model shows
largely mitigated effects in the linearised critical density contrast, non-linear effective
gravitational coupling and the virial overdensity with respect to G3 but still preserves peculiar
features with respect to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, e.g., both the linear critical
density contrast and the virial overdensity are larger than the ones in $\Lambda$CDM. The results
of the spherical collapse model are then used to predict the evolution of the halo mass function,
non-linear matter and lensing power spectra. While at low masses the GGC model presents about 10%
fewer objects with respect to $\Lambda$CDM, at higher masses for $z>0$ it predicts 10% ($z=0.5$)-20%
($z=1$) more objects per comoving volume. Using a phenomenological approach to include the screening
effect in the matter power spectrum, we show that the difference induced by the modifications of
gravity are strongly dependent on the screening scale and that differences can be up to 60% with respect
to $\Lambda$CDM. These differences translate to the lensing power spectrum where qualitatively
the largest differences with respect to the standard cosmological model are for $\ell<10^3$. Depending
on the screening scale, they can reach 60% on larger angular scales and then decrease for growing
$\ell$. The results are obtained for the best fit parameters from cosmological data for each model.
