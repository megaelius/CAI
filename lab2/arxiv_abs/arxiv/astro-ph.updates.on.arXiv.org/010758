A key obstacle to developing a satisfying theory of galaxy evolution is the difficulty in extending
analytic descriptions of early structure formation into full nonlinearity, the regime in which
galaxy growth occurs. Extant techniques, though powerful, are based on approximate numerical
methods whose Monte Carlo-like nature hinders intuition building. Here, we develop a new solution
to this problem and its empirical validation. We first derive closed-form analytic expectations
for the evolution of fixed percentiles in the real-space cosmic density distribution, {\it averaged
over representative volumes observers can track cross-sectionally\/}. Using the Lagrangian
forms of the fluid equations, we show that percentiles in $\delta$---the density relative to the
median---should grow as $\delta(t)\propto\delta_{0}^{\alpha}\,t^{\beta}$, where $\alpha\equiv2$
and $\beta\equiv2$ for Newtonian gravity at epochs after the overdensities transitioned to nonlinear
growth. We then use 9.5 sq.~deg.~of Carnegie-Spitzer-IMACS Redshift Survey data to map {\it galaxy\/}
environmental densities over $0.2<z<1.5$ ($\sim$7~Gyr) and infer $\alpha=1.98\pm0.04$ and
$\beta=2.01\pm0.11$---consistent with our analytic prediction. These findings---enabled
by swapping the Eulerian domain of most work on density growth for a Lagrangian approach to real-space
volumetric averages---provide some of the strongest evidence that a lognormal distribution of
early density fluctuations indeed decoupled from cosmic expansion to grow through gravitational
accretion. They also comprise the first exact, analytic description of the nonlinear growth of
structure extensible to (arbitrarily) low redshift. We hope these results open the door to new modeling
of, and insight-building into, the diversity of galaxy growth in cosmological contexts.
