We present multi-epoch simultaneous radio, optical, H{\alpha}, UV, and X-ray observations of
the active, young, low-mass binary NLTT 33370 AB (blended spectral type M7e). This system is remarkable
for its extreme levels of magnetic activity: it is the most radio-luminous ultracool dwarf (UCD)
known, and here we show that it is also one of the most X-ray luminous UCDs known. We detect the system
in all bands and find a complex phenomenology of both flaring and periodic variability. Analysis
of the optical light curve reveals the simultaneous presence of two periodicities, 3.7859 $\pm$
0.0001 and 3.7130 $\pm$ 0.0002 hr. While these differ by only ~2%, studies of differential rotation
in the UCD regime suggest that it cannot be responsible for the two signals. The system's radio emission
consists of at least three components: rapid 100% polarized flares, bright emission modulating
periodically in phase with the optical emission, and an additional periodic component that appears
only in the 2013 observational campaign. We interpret the last of these as a gyrosynchrotron feature
associated with large-scale magnetic fields and a cool, equatorial plasma torus. However, the
persistent rapid flares at all rotational phases imply that small-scale magnetic loops are also
present and reconnect nearly continuously. We present an SED of the blended system spanning more
than 9 orders of magnitude in wavelength. The significant magnetism present in NLTT 33370 AB will
affect its fundamental parameters, with the components' radii and temperatures potentially altered
by ~+20% and ~-10%, respectively. Finally, we suggest spatially resolved observations that could
clarify many aspects of this system's nature.
