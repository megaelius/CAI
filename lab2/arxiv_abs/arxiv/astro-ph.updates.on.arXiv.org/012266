We explore the survival of cool clouds in multi-phase circum-galactic media. We revisit the "cloud
crushing problem" in a large survey of simulations including radiative cooling, self-shielding,
self-gravity, magnetic fields, and anisotropic Braginskii conduction and viscosity (with saturation).
We explore a wide range of parameters including cloud size, velocity, ambient temperature and density,
as well as a variety of magnetic field configurations and cloud turbulence. We find that realistic
magnetic fields and turbulence have weaker effects on cloud survival; the most important physics
is radiative cooling and conduction. Self-gravity and self-shielding are important for clouds
which are initially Jeans-unstable, but largely irrelevant otherwise. Non-self-gravitating,
realistically magnetized clouds separate into four regimes: (1) At low column densities, clouds
evaporate rapidly via conduction. (2) A "failed pressure confinement" regime, where the ambient
hot gas cools too rapidly to provide pressure confinement for the cloud. (3) An "infinitely long-lived"
regime, in which the cloud lifetime becomes longer than the cooling time of gas swept up in the leading
bow shock, so the cloud begins to accrete and grow. (4) A "classical cloud destruction" regime, where
clouds are eventually destroyed by instabilities. In the final regime, the cloud lifetime can exceed
the naive cloud-crushing time owing to conduction-induced compression. However, small and/or
slow-moving clouds can also evaporate more rapidly than the cloud-crushing time. We develop simple
analytic models that explain the simulated cloud destruction times in this regime.
