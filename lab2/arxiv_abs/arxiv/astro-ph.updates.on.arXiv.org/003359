ROXs 12 (2MASS J16262803-2526477) is a young star hosting a directly imaged companion near the deuterium-burning
limit. We present a suite of spectroscopic, imaging, and time-series observations to characterize
the physical and environmental properties of this system. Moderate-resolution near-infrared
spectroscopy of ROXs 12 B from Gemini-North/NIFS and Keck/OSIRIS reveals signatures of low surface
gravity including weak alkali absorption lines and a triangular $H$-band pseudo-continuum shape.
No signs of Pa$\beta$ emission are evident. As a population, however, we find that about half (46
$\pm$ 14\%) of young ($\lesssim$15 Myr) companions with masses $\lesssim$20 $M_\mathrm{Jup}$
possess actively accreting subdisks detected via Pa$\beta$ line emission, which represents a
lower limit on the prevalence of circumplanetary disks in general as some are expected to be in a quiescent
phase of accretion. The bolometric luminosity of the companion and age of the host star (6$^{+4}_{-2}$
Myr) imply a mass of 17.5 $\pm$ 1.5 $M_\mathrm{Jup}$ for ROXs 12 B based on hot-start evolutionary
models. We identify a wide (5100 AU) tertiary companion to this system, 2MASS J16262774-2527247,
which is heavily accreting and exhibits stochastic variability in its $K2$ light curve. By combining
$v$sin$i_*$ measurements with rotation periods from $K2$, we constrain the line-of-sight inclinations
of ROXs 12 A and 2MASS J16262774-2527247 and find that they are misaligned by 60$^{+7}_{-11}$$^{\circ}$.
In addition, the orbital axis of ROXs 12 B is likely misaligned from the spin axis of its host star ROXs
12 A, suggesting that ROXs 12 B formed akin to fragmenting binary stars or in an equatorial disk that
was torqued by the wide stellar tertiary.
