We present a CMB large-scale polarization dataset obtained by combining WMAP Ka, Q and V with Planck
70 GHz maps. We employ the legacy frequency maps released by the WMAP and Planck collaborations and
perform our own Galactic foreground mitigation technique, which relies on Planck 353 GHz for polarized
dust and on Planck 30 GHz and WMAP K for polarized synchrotron. We derive a single, optimally-noise-weighted,
low-residual-foreground map and the accompanying noise covariance matrix. These are shown, through
$\chi^2$ analysis, to be robust over an ample collection of Galactic masks. We use this dataset,
along with the Planck legacy Commander temperature solution, to build a pixel-based low-resolution
CMB likelihood package, whose robustness we test extensively with the aid of simulations, finding
excellent consistency. Using this likelihood package alone, we constrain the optical depth to
reionazation $\tau=0.069^{+0.011}_{-0.012}$ at $68\%$ C.L., on 54\% of the sky. Adding the Planck
high-$\ell$ temperature and polarization legacy likelihood, the Planck lensing likelihood and
BAO observations we find $\tau=0.0714_{-0.0096}^{+0.0087}$ in a full $\Lambda$CDM exploration.
The latter bounds are slightly less constraining than those obtained employing \Planck\ HFI CMB
data for large angle polarization, that only include EE correlations. Our bounds are based on a largely
independent dataset that does include also TE correlations. They are generally well compatible
with Planck HFI preferring slightly higher values of $\tau$. We make the low-resolution Planck
and WMAP joint dataset publicly available along with the accompanying likelihood code.
