Galaxy formation models and simulations rely on various feedback mechanisms to reproduce the observed
baryonic scaling relations and galaxy morphologies. Although dwarf galaxy and giant elliptical
properties can be explained using feedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei, Milky Way-sized
galaxies still represent a challenge to current theories of galaxy formation. In this paper, we
explore the possible role of feedback from stellar radiation in regulating the main properties
of disk galaxies such as our own Milky Way. We have performed a suite of cosmological simulations
of the same $\sim10^{12} {\rm M}_{\odot}$ halo selected based on its rather typical mass accretion
history. We have implemented radiative feedback from young stars using a crude model of radiative
transfer for ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) radiation. However, the model is realistic enough
such that the dust opacity plays a direct role in regulating the efficiency of our feedback mechanism.
We have explored various models for the dust opacity, assuming different constant dust temperatures,
as well as a varying dust temperature model. We find that while strong radiative feedback appears
as a viable mechanism to regulate the stellar mass fraction in massive galaxies, it also prevents
the formation of discs with reasonable morphologies. In models with strong stellar radiation feedback,
stellar discs are systematically too thick while the gas disc morphology is completely destroyed
due to the efficient mixing between the feedback-affected gas and its surroundings. At the resolution
of our simulation suite, we find it impossible to preserve spiral disc morphology while at the same
time expelling enough baryons to satisfy the abundance matching constraints.
