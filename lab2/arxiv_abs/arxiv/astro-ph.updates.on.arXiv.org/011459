Direct imaging surveys have found that long-period super-Jupiters are rare. By contrast, recent
modeling of the widespread gaps in protoplanetary disks revealed by ALMA suggests an abundant population
of smaller Neptune to Jupiter-mass planets at large separations. The thermal emission from such
lower-mass planets is negligible at optical and near-infrared wavelengths, leaving only their
weak signals in reflected light. Planets do not scatter enough light at these large orbital distances,
but there is a natural way to enhance their reflecting area. Each of the four giant planets in our solar
system hosts swarms of dozens of irregular satellites, gravitationally captured planetesimals
that fill their host planets' spheres of gravitational influence. What we see of them today are the
leftovers of an intense collisional evolution. At early times, they would have generated bright
circumplanetary debris disks. We investigate the properties and detectability of such irregular
satellite disks (ISDs) following models for their collisional evolution from Kennedy and Wyatt
2011. We find that ISD brightnesses peak in the $10-100$ AU range probed by ALMA, and can render planets
detectable over a wide range of parameters with upcoming high-contrast instrumentation. We argue
that future instruments with wide fields of view could simultaneously characterize the atmospheres
of known close-in planets, and reveal the population of long-period $\sim$ Neptune-Jupiter mass
exoplanets inaccessible to other detection methods. This provides a complementary and compelling
science case that would elucidate the early lives of planetary systems.
