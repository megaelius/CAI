Large scale structure surveys promise to be the next leading probe of cosmological information.
It is therefore crucial to reliably predict their observables. The Effective Field Theory of Large
Scale Structures (EFTofLSS) provides a manifestly convergent perturbation theory for the weakly
non-linear regime of dark matter, where correlation functions are computed in an expansion of the
wavenumber k of a mode over the wavenumber associated with the non-linear scale k_nl. Since most
of the information is contained at high wavenumbers, it is necessary to compute higher order corrections
to correlation functions. After the one-loop correction to the matter power spectrum, we estimate
that the next leading one is the two-loop contribution, which we compute here. At this order in k/k_nl,
there is only one counterterm in the EFTofLSS that must be included, though this term contributes
both at tree-level and in several one-loop diagrams. We also discuss correlation functions involving
the velocity and momentum fields. We find that the EFTofLSS prediction at two loops matches to percent
accuracy the non-linear matter power spectrum at redshift zero up to k~0.6 h/Mpc, requiring just
one unknown coefficient that needs to be fit to observations. Given that Standard Perturbation
Theory stops converging at redshift zero at k~0.1 h/Mpc, our results demonstrate the possibility
of accessing a factor of order 200 more dark matter quasi-linear modes than naively expected. If
the remaining observational challenges to accessing these modes can be addressed with similar
success, our results show that there is tremendous potential for large scale structure surveys
to explore the primordial universe.
