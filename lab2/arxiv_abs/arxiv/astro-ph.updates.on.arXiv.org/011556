The creation of "hybrid" white dwarfs, made of a C-O core within a O-Ne shell has been proposed, and
studies indicate that ignition in the C-rich central region makes these viable progenitors for
thermonuclear (type Ia) supernovae. Recent work found that the C-O core is mixed with the surrounding
O-Ne as the white dwarf cools prior to accretion, which results in lower central C fractions in the
massive progenitor than previously assumed. To further investigate the efficacy of hybrid white
dwarfs as progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae, we performed simulations of thermonuclear
supernovae from a new series of hybrid progenitors that include the effects of mixing during cooling.
The progenitor white dwarf model was constructed with the one-dimensional stellar evolution code
MESA and represented a star evolved through the phase of unstable interior mixing followed by accretion
until it reached conditions for the ignition of carbon burning. This MESA model was then mapped to
a two-dimensional initial condition for explosions simulated with FLASH. For comparison, similar
simulations were performed for a traditional C-O progenitor white dwarf. By comparing the yields
of the explosions, we find that, as with earlier studies, the lower C abundance in the hybrid progenitor
compared to the traditional C-O progenitor leads to a lower average yield of 56Ni. Although the unmixed
hybrid WD showed a similar decrement also in total iron group yield, the mixed case does not and produces
a smaller fraction of iron group elements in the form of 56Ni. We attribute this to the higher central
density required for ignition and the location, center or off-center, of deflagration ignition.
