We present results from large-scale numerical simulations of a first order thermal phase transition
in the early universe, in order to explore the shape of the acoustic gravitational wave and the velocity
power spectra. We compare the results with the predictions of the recently proposed sound shell
model. For the gravitational wave power spectrum, we find that the predicted $k^{-3}$ behaviour,
where $k$ is the wavenumber, emerges clearly for detonations. The power spectra from deflagrations
show similar features, but exhibit a steeper high-$k$ decay and an extra feature not accounted for
in the model. There are two independent length scales: the mean bubble separation and the thickness
of the sound shell around the expanding bubble of the low temperature phase. It is the sound shell
thickness which sets the position of the peak of the power spectrum. The low wavenumber behaviour
of the velocity power spectrum is consistent with a causal $k^{3}$, except for the thinnest sound
shell, where it is steeper. We present parameters for a simple broken power law fit to the gravitational
wave power spectrum for wall speeds well away from the speed of sound where this form can be usefully
applied. We examine the prospects for the detection, showing that a LISA-like mission has the sensitivity
to detect a gravitational wave signal from sound waves with an RMS fluid velocity of about $0.05c$,
produced from bubbles with a mean separation of about $10^{-2}$ of the Hubble radius. The shape of
the gravitational wave power spectrum depends on the bubble wall speed, and it may be possible to
estimate the wall speed, and constrain other phase transition parameters, with an accurate measurement
of a stochastic gravitational wave background.
