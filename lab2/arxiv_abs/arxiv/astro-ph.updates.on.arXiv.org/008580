Cosmological information from forthcoming galaxy surveys, such as LSST and Euclid, will soon exceed
that available from the CMB. Higher order correlation functions, like the bispectrum, will be indispensable
for realising this potential. The interpretation of this data faces many challenges because gravitational
collapse of matter is a complex non-linear process, typically modelled by computationally expensive
N-body simulations. Proposed alternatives using fast dark matter codes (e.g. 2LPT or particle-mesh)
are primarily evaluated on their ability to reproduce clustering statistics linked to the matter
power spectrum. The accuracy of these codes can be tested in more detail by looking at higher-order
statistics, and in this paper we will present an efficient and optimal methodology (MODAL-LSS)
to reconstruct the full bispectrum of any 3D density field. We make quantitative comparisons between
a number of fast dark matter codes and Gadget at redshift $z=0.5$. This will serve as an important
diagnostic tool for dark matter/halo mock catalogues and lays the foundation for realistic high
precision analysis with the galaxy bispectrum. In particular, we show that the lack of small-scale
power in the bispectrum of fast codes can be ameliorated by a simple `boosting' technique for the
power spectrum. We also investigate the covariance of the MODAL-LSS bispectrum estimator, demonstrating
the plateauing of non-Gaussian errors in contrast to simple Gaussian extrapolations. This has
important consequences for the extraction of information from the bispectrum and hence parameter
estimation. Finally we make quantitative comparisons of simulation bispectra with theoretical
models, discussing the initial parameters required to create mock catalogues with accurate bispectra.
