Inflation is the leading theory of the first instant of the universe. Inflation, which postulates
that the universe underwent a period of rapid expansion an instant after its birth, provides convincing
explanation for cosmological observations. Recent advancements in detector technology have
opened opportunities to explore primordial gravitational waves generated by the inflation through
B-mode (divergent-free) polarization pattern embedded in the Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies.
If detected, these signals would provide strong evidence for inflation, point to the correct model
for inflation, and open a window to physics at ultra-high energies. LiteBIRD is a satellite mission
with a goal of detecting degree-and-larger-angular-scale B-mode polarization. LiteBIRD will
observe at the second Lagrange point with a 400 mm diameter telescope and 2,622 detectors. It will
survey the entire sky with 15 frequency bands from 40 to 400 GHz to measure and subtract foregrounds.
The U.S. LiteBIRD team is proposing to deliver sub-Kelvin instruments that include detectors and
readout electronics. A lenslet-coupled sinuous antenna array will cover low-frequency bands
(40 GHz to 235 GHz) with four frequency arrangements of trichroic pixels. An orthomode-transducer-coupled
corrugated horn array will cover high-frequency bands (280 GHz to 402 GHz) with three types of single
frequency detectors. The detectors will be made with Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers cooled
to a 100 milli-Kelvin base temperature by an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator.The TES bolometers
will be read out using digital frequency multiplexing with Superconducting QUantum Interference
Device (SQUID) amplifiers. Up to 78 bolometers will be multiplexed with a single SQUID amplidier.
We report on the sub-Kelvin instrument design and ongoing developments for the LiteBIRD mission.
