We introduce the first two simulations of the IllustrisTNG project, a next generation of cosmological
magnetohydrodynamical simulations, focusing on the optical colors of galaxies. We explore TNG100,
a rerun of the original Illustris box, and TNG300, which includes 2x2500^3 resolution elements
in a volume twenty times larger. Here we present first results on the galaxy color bimodality at low
redshift. Accounting for the attenuation of stellar light by dust, we compare the simulated (g-r)
colors of 10^9 < M*/Msun < 10^12.5 galaxies to the observed distribution from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS). We find a striking improvement with respect to the original Illustris simulation,
as well as excellent quantitative agreement in comparison to the observations, with a sharp transition
in median color from blue to red at a characteristic M* ~ 10^10.5 Msun. Investigating the build-up
of the color-mass plane and the formation of the red sequence, we demonstrate that the primary driver
of galaxy color transition in the TNG model is supermassive blackhole feedback in its low-accretion
state. Across the entire population we measure a median color transition timescale dt_green of
~1.6 Gyr, a value which drops for increasingly massive galaxies. We find signatures of the physical
process of quenching: at fixed stellar mass, redder galaxies have lower SFRs, gas fractions, and
gas metallicities; their stellar populations are also older and their large-scale interstellar
magnetic fields weaker than in bluer galaxies. Finally, we measure the amount of stellar mass growth
on the red sequence. Galaxies with M* > 10^11 Msun which redden at z<1 accumulate on average ~25% of
their final z=0 mass post-reddening; at the same time, ~18% of such massive galaxies acquire half
or more of their final stellar mass while on the red sequence.
