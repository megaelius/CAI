We investigate the possibility of performing cosmological studies in the redshift range $2.5<z<5$
through suitable extensions of existing and upcoming radio-telescopes like CHIME, HIRAX and FAST.
We use the Fisher matrix technique to forecast the bounds that those instruments can place on the
growth rate, the Alcock-Paczynski parameters, the sum of the neutrino masses and the number of relativistic
degrees of freedom at decoupling, $N_{\rm eff}$. We point out that quantities that depend on the
amplitude of the 21cm power spectrum, like $f\sigma_8$, are completely degenerate with $\Omega_{\rm
HI}$ and $b_{\rm HI}$, and propose several strategies to independently constraint them through
cross-correlations with other probes. Assuming $5\%$ priors on $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ and $b_{\rm
HI}$, $k_{\rm max}=0.2~h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and the primary beam wedge, we find that a HIRAX extension
can constrain, within bins of $\Delta z=0.1$: 1) the value of $f\sigma_8$ at $\simeq4\%$, 2) the
value of $D_A$ and $H$ at $\simeq1\%$. In combination with data from Euclid-like galaxy surveys
and CMB S4, the sum of the neutrino masses can be constrained with an error equal to $23$ meV ($1\sigma$),
while $N_{\rm eff}$ can be constrained within 0.02 ($1\sigma$). We derive similar constraints
for the extensions of the other instruments. We study in detail the dependence of our results on the
instrument, amplitude of the HI bias, the foreground wedge coverage, the nonlinear scale used in
the analysis, uncertainties in the theoretical modeling and the priors on $b_{\rm HI}$ and $\Omega_{\rm
HI}$. We conclude that 21cm intensity mapping surveys operating in this redshift range can provide
extremely competitive constraints on key cosmological parameters.
