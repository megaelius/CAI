We present an unbinned likelihood analysis formalism employing photon weights -- the probabilities
that events are associated with a particular source. This approach is applicable to any photon-resolving
instrument, and thus well suited to high-energy observations; we focus here on GeV $\gamma$-ray
data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. Weights connect individual photons to the outputs of a
detailed, expensive likelihood analysis of a much larger data set. The weighted events can be aggregated
into arbitrary time spans ranging from microseconds to years. Such retrospective grouping permits
time- and frequency-domain analysis over a wide range of scales and enables characterization of
disparate phenomena like blazar flares, $\gamma$-ray bursts, pulsar pulses, novae, $\gamma$-ray
binaries, and other variable sources. To demonstrate the formalism, we incorporate photon weights
into the Bayesian blocks algorithm and perform a hierarchical time scale analysis of 3C 279 activity.
We analyze pulsar pulse profiles and estimate the unpulsed emission level and the optimal division
of the data into on- and off-pulse intervals. We extend the formalism to Fourier analysis and derive
estimators for power spectra, used to search for and characterize periodic sources. We show how
the Fast Fourier transform can be used to probe orbital periods as short as a minute and we discuss
mitigation of spurious signals. Our final example combines time- and frequency- domain analysis
to jointly characterize the flares and orbital modulation of Cygnus X-3, yielding the strongest
detection of the orbital signal ($>$13$\sigma$) to date. Finally, we discuss extensions of the
work to other GeV sources and to X-ray and TeV observations.
