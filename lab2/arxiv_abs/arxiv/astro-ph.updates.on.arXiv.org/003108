We use numerical N-body hydrodynamical simulations with varying PopIII stellar models to investigate
the possibility of detecting first star signatures with observations of high-redshift damped
Ly$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs). The simulations include atomic and molecular cooling, star formation,
energy feedback and metal spreading due to the evolution of stars with a range of masses and metallicities.
Different initial mass functions (IMFs) and corresponding metal-dependent yields and lifetimes
are adopted to model primordial stellar populations. The DLAs in the simulations are selected according
to either the local gas temperature (temperature selected) or the host mass (mass selected). We
find that 3\% (40\%) of mass (temperature) selected high-$z$ ($z\ge5.5$) DLAs retain signatures
of pollution from PopIII stars, independently from the first star model. Such DLAs have low halo
mass ($<10^{9.6}\,\rm M_{\odot}$), metallicity ($<10^{-3}\,\rm Z_{\odot}$) and star formation
rate ($<10^{-1.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$). { Metal abundance ratios of DLAs imprinted in the
spectra of QSO} can be useful tools to infer the properties of the polluting stellar generation and
to constrain the first star mass ranges. Comparing the abundance ratios derived from our simulations
to those observed in DLAs at $z\ge5$, we find that most of these DLAs are consistent within errors
with PopII stars dominated enrichment and strongly disfavor the pollution pattern of very massive
first stars (i.e. 100~$\rm M_{\odot}$-500~$\rm M_{\odot}$). However, some of them could still
result from the pollution of first stars in the mass range [0.1, 100]~$\rm M_{\odot}$. In particular,
we find that the abundance ratios from SDSS J1202+3235 are consistent with those expected from PopIII
enrichment dominated by massive (but not extreme) first stars.
