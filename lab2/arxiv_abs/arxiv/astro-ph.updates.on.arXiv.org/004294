It is known that the strength of neutral oxygen triplet lines at 7771-5 A shows a luminosity effect
in evolved A through G stars. However, its general behavior across the HR diagram is not yet well understood,
since the applicability limit of the relations proposed by various previous work (tending to be
biased toward supergiants) still remains unclear. Besides, our understanding on the nature of
atmospheric micro-scale turbulence, which is considered to play a significant role (along with
the non-LTE line intensification) for the cause of this effect, is still insufficient. Towards
clarifying these problems, we carried out an extensive non-LTE spectrum-fitting analysis of O
I 7771--5 lines for unbiased sample of 75 evolved A-, F,- and G-type stars over wide luminosity classes
(from subgiants through supergiants) including rapid rotators, from which the total equivalent
width (W_77) was derived and the microturbulence (xi) was determined by two different (profile-
and abundance-based) methods for each star. While we confirmed that W_77 tends to increase in the
global sense as a star's absolute magnitude (M_V) becomes more luminous, distinctly different
trends were found between lower-gravity (log g <~ 2.5) and higher-gravity (log g >~ 2.5) stars, in
the sense that the M_V vs. W_77 formulas proposed by past studies are applicable only to the former
supergiant group. In case of using W_77 for empirical M_V evaluation by such simple formulas, it
is recommended to confine only to supergiants of -5 > M_V > -10. Regarding the microturbulence significantly
controlling W_77, it roughly shows an increasing tendency with a decrease in surface gravity. However,
the trend is not monotonic but rather intricate (e.g., hump, stagnation, or discontinuously large
increase) depending on the stellar type and evolutionary stage.
