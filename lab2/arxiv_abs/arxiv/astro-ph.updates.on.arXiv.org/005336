We reconstruct the two-dimensional (2D) matter distributions in 20 high-mass galaxy clusters
selected from the CLASH survey, by using the new approach of performing a joint weak lensing analysis
of 2D shear and azimuthally averaged magnification measurements. This combination allows for
a complete analysis of the field, effectively breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy. In a Bayesian
framework, we simultaneously constrain the mass profile and morphology of each individual cluster
assuming an elliptical Navarro-Frenk-White halo characterized by the mass, concentration, projected
axis ratio, and position angle of the projected major axis.. We find that spherical mass estimates
of the clusters from azimuthally averaged weak-lensing measurements in previous work are in excellent
agreement with our results from a full 2D analysis. Combining all 20 clusters in our sample, we detect
the elliptical shape of weak-lensing halos at the $5\sigma$ significance level at a scale of 2Mpc$/h$.
The median projected axis ratio is $0.67\pm 0.07$ at a virial mass of $M_\mathrm{vir}=(15.2\pm
2.8) \times 10^{14} M_\odot$, which is in agreement with theoretical predictions of the standard
collisionless cold dark matter model. We also study misalignment statistics of brightest cluster
galaxy, X-ray, thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, and strong-lensing morphologies with respect
to the weak-lensing signal. Among the three baryonic tracers studied here, we find that the X-ray
morphology is best aligned with the weak-lensing mass distribution, with a median misalignment
angle of $21\pm 7$ degrees. We also conduct a stacked quadrupole shear analysis assuming that the
X-ray major axis is aligned with that of the projected mass distribution. This yields a consistent
axis ratio of $0.67\pm 0.10$, suggesting again a tight alignment between the intracluster gas and
dark matter.
