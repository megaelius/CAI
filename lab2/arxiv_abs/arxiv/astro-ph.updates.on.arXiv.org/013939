We present a statistical analysis of 43 coronal dimming events, associated with Earth-directed
CMEs that occurred during the period of quasi-quadrature of the SDO and STEREO satellites. We studied
coronal dimmings that were observed above the limb by STEREO/EUVI and compared their properties
with the mass and speed of the associated CMEs. The unique position of satellites allowed us to compare
our findings with the results from Dissauer et al. (2018b, 2019), who studied the same events observed
against the solar disk by SDO/AIA. Such statistics is done for the first time and confirms the relation
of coronal dimmings and CME parameters for the off-limb viewpoint. The observations of dimming
regions from different lines-of-sight reveal a similar decrease in the total EUV intensity ($c=0.60\pm0.14$).
We find that the (projected) dimming areas are typically larger for off-limb observations (mean
value of $1.24\pm1.23\times10^{11}$ km$^2$ against $3.51\pm0.71\times10^{10}$ km$^2$ for
on-disk), with a correlation of $c=0.63\pm0.10$. This systematic difference can be explained
by the (weaker) contributions to the dimming regions higher up in the corona, that cannot be detected
in the on-disk observations. The off-limb dimming areas and brightnesses show very strong correlations
with the CME mass ($c=0.82\pm0.06$ and $c=0.75\pm0.08$), whereas the dimming area and brightness
change rate correlate with the CME speed ($c\sim0.6$). Our findings suggest that coronal dimmings
have the potential to provide early estimates of mass and speed of Earth-directed CMEs, relevant
for space weather forecasts, for satellite locations both at L1 and L5.
