An intense search for kinematic signatures of reverberation mapping of close binary SMBH (SMBBH)
is currently ongoing. Elliptical SMBBH systems (i.e. both orbits and disc-like broad-line regions
(BLR) are elliptic) have not been assessed in two-dimensional transfer functions (2DTF) studies.
We aim to numerically infer such a 2DTF because the geometry of the unresolved region is imprinted
on their optical emission. Through this, we determine their specific kinematical signatures.
We simulated the geometry and kinematics of SMBBH whose components are on elliptical orbits. Each
SMBH had a disc-like elliptical BLR. The SMBHs were active and orbited each other tightly at a subparsec
distance. Here we calculate for the first time 2DTF, as defined in the velocity-time delay plane,
for several elliptical configurations of SMBBH orbits and their BLRs. We find that these very complex
configurations are clearly resolved in maps. These results are distinct from those obtained from
circular and disc-wind geometry. We calculate the expected line variability for all SMBBH configurations.
We show that the line shapes are influenced by the orbital phase of the SMBBH. Some line profiles resemble
observed profiles, but they can also be much deformed to look like those from the disc-wind model.
First, our results imply that using our 2DTF, we can detect and quantify kinematic signatures of
elliptical SMBBH. Second, the calculated expected line profiles share some intriguing similarities
with observed profiles, but also with some profiles that are synthesised in disc-wind models. To
overcome the non-uniqueness of the spectral line shapes as markers of SMBBH, they must be accompanied
with 2DTF.
