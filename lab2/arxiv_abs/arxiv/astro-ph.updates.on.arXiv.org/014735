We present a large high-resolution study of the distribution and evolution of CIV absorbers, including
the weakest population with equivalent widths $W_r<0.3$~{\AA}. By searching 369 high-resolution,
high signal-to-noise spectra of quasars at $1.1\leq z_{em} \leq5.3$ from Keck/HIRES and VLT/UVES,
we find $1318$ CIV absorbers with $W_r \geq 0.05$~{\AA} (our $\sim50\%$ completeness limit) at
redshifts $1\leq z \leq4.75$. A Schechter function describes the observed equivalent width distribution
with a transition from power-law to exponential decline at $W_r \gtrsim 0.5$~{\AA}. The power-law
slope $\alpha$ rises and normalization $n_{\star}$ falls by $\sim20\%$ from $1\leq z<2.5$ to $2.5\leq
z \leq4.75$. We find that the co-moving redshift path density, $dN/dX$, of $W_r \geq 0.05$~{\AA}
absorbers rises by $\sim1.8$ times from $z=4.75$ to $z=1$, while the increase in the $W_r \geq 0.6$~{\AA}
$dN/dX$ is $\sim4.5$ times as much. We quantify the observed evolution by a model in which $dN/dX$
decreases linearly with redshift. The model suggests that populations with larger $W_r$ thresholds
evolve faster with redshift and appear later in the universe. The cosmological {\sc Technicolor
Dawn} simulations at $3\leq z \leq5$ over-produce the observed abundance of absorbers with $W_r<0.3$~{\AA},
while yielding good agreement at higher $W_r$. Our empirical linear model successfully describes
CIV evolution in the simulations and the observed evolution of $W_r \geq 0.6$~{\AA} CIV for the past
$\sim12$ Gyr. Combining our measurements with the literature gives us a picture of CIV-absorbing
structures becoming more numerous and/or larger in physical size over the last $\approx13$ Gyr
of cosmic time ($z\sim6$ to $z\sim0$).
