We present a catalog of 510 radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN, primarily blazars) and 287 dusty
star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) detected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope at $> 5 \sigma$ significance
in frequency bands centered on 148 GHz (2 mm), 218 GHz (1.4 mm) and 277 GHz (1.1 mm), from a 480 square
degrees strip centered at R.A. 00h on the celestial equator with additional 360 square degrees shallower
auxiliary fields at other longitudes. The combination of the deepest available 218 GHz wide-field
imaging, our 277 GHz data, and multi-band filtering yields the most sensitive wide-field millimeter-wave
DSFG selection to date with rms noise level referenced to 218 GHz reaching below 2 mJy. We developed
new techniques to remove Galactic contamination (including evidence for CO(2-1) line emission)
from the extragalactic catalog, providing a catalog of 321 Galactic sources in addition to the extragalactic
catalog. We employ a new flux debiasing method that accounts for the heterogeneous sample selection
in the presence of Galactic cuts. We present the spectral properties and source counts of the AGN
and DSFGs. The DSFG spectra depart from the Rayleigh-Jeans regime of an optically thin modified
blackbody between 218 GHz and 277 GHz, consistent with optically thick emission. For AGN with 148
and 218 GHz flux density > 50 mJy, we estimate the inter-year RMS fractional deviation in flux density
due to source variability to be 40%. We provide source counts for AGN in the range 8$-$2870 mJy and
for DSFGs in the range 8$-$90 mJy. Our DSFG counts probe both the brighter, lensed population and
the fainter, unlensed population. At 277 GHz we report the first measurements of source counts at
these flux densities, finding an excess above most model count predictions. Finally, we present
thirty of the brightest DSFGs selected for multi-frequency study as candidate high-z lensed systems.
