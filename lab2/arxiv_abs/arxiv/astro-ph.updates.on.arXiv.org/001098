We aim to determine abundances of Li, O and Na in a sample of of 110 turn-off (TO) stars, in order to study
the evolution of light elements in this cluster and to put our results in perspective with observations
of other globular and open clusters, as well as with field stars. We use medium resolution spectra
obtained with the GIRAFFE spectrograph at the ESO 8.2m Kueyen VLT telescope and use state of the art
1D model atmospheres and NLTE line transfer to determine the abundances. We also employ CO5BOLD
hydrodynamical simulations to assess the impact of stellar granulation on the line formation and
inferred abundances. Our results confirm the existence of Na-O abundance anti-correlation and
hint towards a possible Li-O anti-correlation in the TO stars of 47 Tuc. We find no convincing evidence
supporting the existence of Li-Na correlation. The obtained 3D NLTE mean lithium abundance in a
sample of 94 TO stars where Li lines were detected reliably, $\langle A({\rm Li})_{\rm 3D~NLTE}\rangle
= 1.78 \pm 0.18$ dex, appears to be significantly lower than what is observed in other globular clusters.
At the same time, star-to-star spread in Li abundance is also larger than seen in other clusters.
The highest Li abundance observed in 47 Tuc is about 0.1 dex lower than the lowest Li abundance observed
among the un-depleted stars of the metal-poor open cluster NGC 2243. The lithium abundances in 47
Tuc, when put into context with observations in other clusters and field stars, suggest that stars
that are more metal-rich than [FeH] \sim -1.0 experience significant lithium depletion during
their lifetime on the main sequence, while the more metal-poor stars do not. Rather strikingly,
our results suggest that initial lithium abundance with which the star was created may only depend
on its age (the younger the star, the higher its Li content) and not on its metallicity.
