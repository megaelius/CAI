In order for Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) and other Stage IV dark energy experiments
(e.g., Large Synoptic Survey Telescope; LSST, and Euclid) to infer cosmological parameters not
limited by systematic errors, accurate redshift measurements are needed. This accuracy can be
met by using spectroscopic subsamples to calibrate the photometric redshifts for the full sample.
In this work we employ the Self Organizing Map (SOM) spectroscopic sampling technique, to find the
minimal number of spectra required for the WFIRST weak lensing calibration. We use galaxies from
the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) to build the LSST+WFIRST
lensing analog sample of ~36 k objects and train the LSST+WFIRST SOM. We find that 26% of the WFIRST
lensing sample consists of sources fainter than the Euclid depth in the optical, 91% of which live
in color cells already occupied by brighter galaxies. We demonstrate the similarity between faint
and bright galaxies as well as the feasibility of redshift measurements at different brightness
levels. Our results suggest that the spectroscopic sample acquired for calibration to the Euclid
depth is sufficient for calibrating the majority of the WFIRST color-space. For the spectroscopic
sample to fully represent the synthetic color-space of WFIRST, we recommend obtaining additional
spectroscopy of ~0.2-1.2 k new sources in cells occupied by mostly faint galaxies. We argue that
either the small area of the CANDELS fields and the small overall sample size or the large photometric
errors might be the reason for no/less bright galaxies mapped to these cells. Acquiring the spectra
of these sources will confirm the above findings and will enable the comprehensive calibration
of the WFIRST color-redshift relation.
