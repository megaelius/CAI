Interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs) can be loosely defined as chemical compounds with
at least six atoms in which at least one is carbon. The observations of iCOMs in star-forming regions
have shown that they contain an important fraction of carbon in a molecular form, which can be used
to synthesize more complex, even biotic molecules. Hence, iCOMs are major actors in the increasing
molecular complexity in space and they might have played a role in the origin of terrestrial life.
Understand-ing how iCOMs are formed is relevant for predicting the ultimate organic chemistry
reached in the interstellar medium. One possibility is that they are synthesized on the interstellar
grain icy surfaces, via recombination of previously formed radicals. The present work focuses
on the reactivity of HCO with CH3/NH2 on the grain icy sur-faces, investigated by means of quantum
chemical simulations. The goal is to carry outa systematic study using different computational
approaches and models for the icy surfaces. Specifically, DFT computations have been bench-marked
with CASPT2 and CCSD(T) methods, and the ice mantles have been mimicked with cluster models of 1,
2, 18 and 33 H2O molecules, in which different reaction sites have been considered. Our results indicate
that the HCO + CH3/NH2 reactions, if they actually occur, have two major competitive channels: the
formation of iCOMs CH3CHO/NH2CHO, or the formation of CO + CH4/NH3. These two channels are either
barrierless or presentrelatively low ($\leq$ 10 kJ/mol equal to about 1200 K) energy barriers.
Finally, we briefly discuss the astrophysical implications of these findings.
