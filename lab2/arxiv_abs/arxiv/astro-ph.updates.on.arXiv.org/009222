We present a measurement of the anisotropic void-galaxy cross-correlation function in the CMASS
galaxy sample of the BOSS DR12 data release. We perform a joint fit to the data for redshift space distortions
(RSD) due to galaxy peculiar velocities and anisotropies due to the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect,
for the first time using a velocity field reconstruction technique to remove the complicating effects
of RSD in the void centre positions themselves. Fits to the void-galaxy function give a 1% measurement
of the AP parameter combination $D_A(z)H(z)/c = 0.436\pm0.005$ at redshift $z=0.57$, where $D_A$
is the angular diameter distance and $H$ the Hubble parameter, exceeding the precision obtainable
from baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) by a factor of ~3.5 and free of systematic errors. From voids
alone we also obtain a 12% measure of the growth rate, $f\sigma_8(z=0.57)=0.050\pm0.06$. The parameter
degeneracies are orthogonal to those obtained from galaxy clustering. Combining void information
with that from BAO and galaxy RSD in the same CMASS sample, we measure $D_A(0.57)/r_s=9.36\pm0.07$
(at 0.75% precision), $H(0.57)r_s=(14.03\pm0.16)\;10^3$ kms$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$ (1.1%) and
$f\sigma_8=0.450\pm0.019$ (4.2%), consistent with cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements
from Planck. These represent a factor ~2 improvement in precision over previous results through
the inclusion of void information. Fitting a flat cosmological constant LCDM model to these results
in combination with Planck CMB data, we find up to a 16% reduction in uncertainties on $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$
compared to use of the corresponding BOSS consensus values. Constraints on extended models with
non-flat geometry and a dark energy of state that differs from $w=-1$ show an even greater improvement.
