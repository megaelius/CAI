A longitudinal magnetic field with a strength of 5.2kG was recently detected in CPD -62 2124, which
has a fractional main-sequence lifetime of about 60%. Strongly magnetic early-B type chemically
peculiar stars in an advanced evolutionary state are of special interest to understand the evolution
of the angular momentum and spin-down timescales in the presence of a global magnetic field. We exploited
17 FORS2 low-resolution spectropolarimetric observations and 844 ASAS3 photometric measurements
for the determination of the rotation period, pulsations, and the magnetic field geometry of the
star. We calculated periodograms and applied phenomenological models of photometric, spectral
and spectropolarimetric variability. We found that all quantities studied, specifically equivalent
widths, the mean longitudinal magnetic field <B_z>, and the flux in the V filter, vary with the same
period P = 2.628d, which was identified as the rotation period. The observed variations can be fully
explained by a rigidly rotating main-sequence star with an uneven distribution of chemical elements,
photometric spots, and a stable, nearly dipolar magnetic field with a polar field strength of about
21kG, frozen into the body of the star. The magnetic field of CPD -62 2124 is tilted to the rotation
axis by beta=28+-7deg, while the inclination of the rotation axis towards the line of sight is only
i=20+-5deg. In the acquired FORS2 spectra, we detect short-term line profile variations indicating
the presence of beta Cephei type pulsations. As of today, no other pulsating star of this type is known
to possess such a strong magnetic field.
