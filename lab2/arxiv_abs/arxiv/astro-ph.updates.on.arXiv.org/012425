We explore the galaxy-galaxy merger rate with the empirical model for galaxy formation, EMERGE.
On average, we find that between $2$ per cent and $6$ per cent of massive galaxies ($\log_{10}(m_{*}/M_{\odot})
\geq 10.3$) will experience a major merger per Gyr. Our model predicts galaxy merger rates that do
not scale as a power-law with redshift, and exhibit a clear stellar mass and mass-ratio dependence,
unlike the underlying halo-halo merger rate. Specifically, major mergers are more frequent at
high masses and at low redshift. We show mergers are significant for the stellar mass growth of galaxies
$\log_{10}(m_{*}/M_{\odot}) \gtrsim 11.0$. For the most massive galaxies major mergers dominate
the accreted mass fraction, contributing as much as $90$ per cent of the total accreted stellar mass.
We argue that these phenomena are a direct result of the stellar-to-halo mass relation, which results
in massive galaxies having a higher likelihood of experiencing major mergers than low mass galaxies.
Furthermore, we find no statistical evidence for mergers as a driving mechanism for quenching,
with more than $58$ per cent of the most massive galaxies experiencing no major merger within $2$
Gyr of quenching. Our model produces a galaxy pair fraction consistent with resent observations,
exhibiting a form best described by a power-law exponential function. Translating these pair fractions
into merger rates results in an over prediction compared to the model intrinsic values. We find the
pair fraction can be best mapped to the intrinsic merger rate by adopting a constant observation
timescale $T_{obs}=2.56$ Gyr, assuming all observed pairs merge by $z=0$.
