The inner parsec of our Galaxy contains tens of Wolf-Rayet stars whose powerful outflows are constantly
interacting while filling the region with hot, diffuse plasma. Theoretical models have shown that,
in some cases, the collision of stellar winds can generate cold, dense material in the form of clumps.
However, their formation process and properties are not well understood yet. In this work we present,
for the first time, a statistical study of the clump formation process in unstable wind collisions.
We study systems with dense outflows (${\sim}10^{-5}\rm\ M_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}$), wind speeds of
$500$-$1500\rm\ km\ s^{-1}$, and stellar separations of ${\sim}20$-$200\rm\ au$. We develop
3D high resolution hydrodynamical simulations of stellar wind collisions with the adaptive-mesh
refinement grid-based code Ramses. We aim to characterise the initial properties of clumps that
form through hydrodynamic instabilities, mostly via the non-linear thin shell instability (NTSI).
Our results confirm that more massive clumps are formed in systems whose winds are close to the transition
between the radiative and adiabatic regimes. Increasing either the wind speed or the degree of asymmetry
increases the dispersion of the clump mass and ejection speed distributions. Nevertheless, the
most massive clumps are very light (${\sim}10^{-3}$-$10^{-2}\rm\ M_{\oplus}$), about three
orders of magnitude less massive than theoretical upper limits. Applying these results to the Galactic
Centre we find that clumps formed through the NTSI should not be heavy enough either to affect the
thermodynamic state of the region or to survive for long enough to fall onto the central super-massive
black hole.
