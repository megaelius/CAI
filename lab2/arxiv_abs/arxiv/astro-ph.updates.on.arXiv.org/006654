The Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey (GPIES) is a direct imaging campaign designed to search
for young, self-luminous, giant exoplanets. To date, GPIES has observed nearly 500 targets, and
generated over 30,000 individual exposures using its integral field spectrograph (IFS) instrument.
The GPIES team has developed a campaign data system with a database incorporating all of the metadata
for all individual raw data products, including environmental conditions and instrument performance
metrics. The same database also indexes metadata associated with multiple levels of reduced data
products, including contrast measures for individual images and combined image sequences, which
serve as the primary metric of performance for the final science products. The database is also used
to track telemetry products from the adaptive optics subsystem, and associate these with corresponding
IFS data. Here, we discuss several data exploration and visualization projects enabled by the GPIES
database. Of particular interest are any correlations between instrument performance and environmental
or operating conditions. We show single and multiple-parameter fits of single-image and observing
sequence contrast as functions of various seeing measures, and discuss automated outlier rejection
and other fitting concerns. Supervised learning techniques are employed in order to partition
the space of raw (single image) to final (full sequence) contrast in order to better predict the value
of the final data set from the first few completed observations. Finally, we discuss the particular
features of the database design that aid in performing these analyses, and suggest potential future
upgrades and refinements.
