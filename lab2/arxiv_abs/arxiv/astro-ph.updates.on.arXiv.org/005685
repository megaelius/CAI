We present the analysis of 61 nucleated dwarf galaxies in the central regions ($<R_{\rm vir}/4$)
of the Fornax galaxy cluster. The galaxies and their nuclei are studied as part of the Next Generation
Fornax Survey (NGFS) using optical imaging obtained with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) mounted
at Blanco/CTIO and near-infrared data obtained with VIRCam at VISTA/ESO. We decompose the nucleated
dwarfs in nucleus and spheroid, after subtracting the surface brightness profile of the spheroid
component and studying the nucleus using PSF photometry.In general, nuclei are consistent with
colors of confirmed metal-poor globular clusters, but with significantly smaller dispersion
than other confirmed compact stellar systems in Fornax. We find a bimodal nucleus mass distribution
with peaks located at $\log({\cal M_*}/M_\odot)\!\simeq\!5.4$ and $\sim\,6.3$. These two nucleus
sub-populations have different stellar population properties, the more massive nuclei are older
than $\sim\!2$ Gyr and have metal-poor stellar populations ($Z\leq0.02\,Z_\odot$), while the
less massive nuclei are younger than $\sim\!2$ Gyr with metallicities in the range $0.02\!<\!Z/Z_\odot\!\leq\!1$.
We find that the nucleus mass (${\cal M}_{\rm nuc}$) vs. galaxy mass (${\cal M}_{\rm gal}$) relation
becomes shallower for less massive galaxies starting around $10^8\,M_\odot$ and the mass ratio
$\eta_n\!=\!{\cal M}_{\rm nuc}/{\cal M}_{\rm gal}$ shows a clear anti-correlation with ${\cal
M}_{\rm gal}$ for the lowest masses, reaching $10\%$. We test current theoretical models of nuclear
cluster formation and find that they cannot fully reproduce the observed trends. A likely mixture
of in-situ star formation and star-cluster mergers seem to be acting during nucleus growth over
cosmic time.
