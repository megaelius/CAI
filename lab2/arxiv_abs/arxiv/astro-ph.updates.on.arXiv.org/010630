We combine the Shark semi-analytic model of galaxy formation with the ProSpect software tool for
spectral energy distribution (SED) generation to study the multi-wavelength emission of galaxies
from the far-ultraviolet (FUV) to the far-infrared (FIR) at $0\le z\le 10$. We produce a physical
model for the attenuation of galaxies across cosmic time by combining a local Universe empirical
relation to compute the dust mass of galaxies from their gas metallicity and mass, attenuation curves
derived from radiative transfer calculations of galaxies in the EAGLE hydrodynamic simulation
suite, and the properties of Shark galaxies. We are able to produce a wide range of galaxies, from
the $z=8$ star-forming galaxies with almost no extinction, $z=2$ submillimeter galaxies, down
to the normal star-forming and red sequence galaxies at $z=0$. Quantitatively, we find that Shark
reproduces the observed (i) the $z=0$ FUV-to-FIR, (ii) $0\le z\le 3$ rest-frame $K$-band, and (iii)
$0\le z\le 10$ rest-frame FUV luminosity functions, (iv) $z\le 8$ UV slopes, (v) the FUV-to-FIR
number counts (including the widely disputed 850$\mu$m), (vi) redshift distribution of bright
$850\mu$m galaxies and (vii) the integrated cosmic SED from $z=0$ to $z=1$ to an unprecedented level.
This is achieved without the need to invoke changes in the stellar initial mass function, dust-to-metal
mass ratio, or metal enrichment timescales. Our model predicts star formation in galaxy disks to
dominate in the FUV-to-optical, while bulges dominate at the NIR at all redshifts. The FIR sees a
strong evolution in which disks dominate at $z\le 1$ and starbursts (triggered by both galaxy mergers
and disk instabilities, in an even mix) dominate at higher redshifts, even out to $z=10$.
