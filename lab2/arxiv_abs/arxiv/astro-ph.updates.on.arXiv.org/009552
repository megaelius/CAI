Based on recent observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), claims of statistical anomalies
in the properties of the CMB fluctuations have been made. Although the statistical significance
of the anomalies remains only at the $\sim2-3\sigma$ significance level, the fact that there are
many different anomalies, several of which support a possible deviation from statistical isotropy,
has motivated a search for models that provide a common mechanism to generate them. The goal of this
paper is to investigate whether these anomalies could originate from non-Gaussian cosmological
models, and to determine what properties these models should have. We present a simple isotropic,
non-Gaussian class of toy models that can reproduce six of the most extensively studied anomalies.
We compare the presence of anomalies found in simulated maps generated from the toy models and from
a standard model with Gaussian fluctuations. We show that the following anomalies, as found in the
Planck data, commonly occur in the toy model maps: (1) large-scale hemispherical asymmetry (large-scale
dipolar modulation), (2) small-scale hemispherical asymmetry (alignment of the spatial distribution
of CMB power over all scales $\ell=[2,1500]$) , (3) a strongly non-Gaussian hot or cold spot, (4)
a low power spectrum amplitude for $\ell<30$, including specifically (5) a low quadrupole and an
unusual alignment between the quadrupole and the octopole, and (6) parity asymmetry of the lowest
multipoles. We note that this class of toy model resembles models of primordial non-Gaussianity
characterised by strongly scale-dependent $g_{NL}$-like trispectra.
