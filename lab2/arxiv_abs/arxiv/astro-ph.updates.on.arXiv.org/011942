Understanding radial migration is a crucial point to build relevant chemical and dynamical evolution
models of the Milky Way disk. In this paper, we analyze a high-resolution N-body simulation of a Milky
Way-type galaxy to study the role that the slowing down of a stellar bar has is generating migration
from the inner to the outer disk. Stellar particles are trapped by the main resonances (corotation
and Outer Lindblad resonance) which then propagate outwards across the disk due to the bar slowing
down. Once the bar strength reaches its maximal amplitude, some of the stars, delivered to the outer
disk, escape the resonances and some of them settle on nearly circular orbits. The number of the escaped
stars gradually increases also due to the decrease of the bar strength when the boxy/peanut bulge
forms. We show that this mechanism is not limited only to stars on nearly circular orbits: also stars
initially on more eccentric orbits can be transferred outwards (out to the OLR location) and can
end up on nearly circular orbits. Therefore, the propagation of the bar resonances outwards can
induce the circularization of the orbits of some of the migrating stars. The mechanism investigated
in this paper can explain the presence of metal-rich stars at the solar vicinity and more generally
in the outer galactic disk. Our dynamical model predicts that up to 3% of stars in between of corotation
and the OLR can be formed in the innermost region of the Milky Way. The epoch of the Milky Way bar formation
can be potentially constrained by analyzing the age distribution of the most metal-rich stars at
the solar vicinity.
