We present a highly-scalable framework that targets problems of interest to the numerical relativity
and broader astrophysics communities. This framework combines a parallel octree-refined adaptive
mesh with a wavelet adaptive multiresolution and a physics module to solve the Einstein equations
of general relativity in the BSSN formulation. The goal of this work is to perform advanced, massively
parallel numerical simulations of Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals (IMRIs) of binary black holes
with mass ratios on the order of 100:1. These studies will be used to generate waveforms as used in
LIGO data analysis and to calibrate semi-analytical approximate methods. Our framework consists
of a distributed memory octree-based adaptive meshing framework in conjunction with a node-local
code generator. The code generator makes our code portable across different architectures. The
equations corresponding to the target application are written in symbolic notation and generators
for different architectures can be added independent of the application. Additionally, this symbolic
interface also makes our code extensible, and as such has been designed to easily accommodate many
existing algorithms in astrophysics for plasma dynamics and radiation hydrodynamics. Our adaptive
meshing algorithms and data-structures have been optimized for modern architectures with deep
memory hierarchies. This enables our framework to have achieve excellent performance and scalability
on modern leadership architectures. We demonstrate excellent weak scalability up to 131K cores
on ORNL's Titan for binary mergers for mass ratios up to 100.
