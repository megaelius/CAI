HD 135344B is an accreting (pre-) transition disk which displays emission of warm CO extending tens
of AU inside its 30 AU dust cavity. We employ the dust radiative transfer code MCFOST and the thermo-chemical
code ProDiMo to derive the disk structure from the simultaneous modeling of the spectral energy
distribution (SED), VLT/CRIRES CO P(10) 4.75 micron, Herschel/PACS [O I] 63 micron, Spitzer-IRS,
and JCMT 12CO J=3-2 spectra, VLTI/PIONIER H-band visibilities, and constraints from (sub-)mm
continuum interferometry and near-IR imaging. We found a disk model able to describe simultaneously
the current observations. This disk has the following structure: (1) to reproduce the SED, the near-IR
interferometry data, and the CO ro-vibrational emission, refractory grains (we suggest carbon)
are present inside the silicate sublimation radius (0.08<R<0.2 AU); (2) the dust cavity
(R<30 AU) is filled with gas, the surface density of this gas must increase with radius to fit the
CO P(10) line profile, a small gap of a few AU in the gas is compatible with current data, a large gap
in the gas is not likely; (4) the gas/dust ratio inside the cavity is > 100 to account for the 870
micron continuum upper limit and the CO P(10) line flux; (5) the gas/dust ratio at 30<R<200
AU is < 10 to simultaneously describe the [O I] 63 micron line flux and the CO P(10) line profile;
(6) in the outer disk most of the mass should be located in the mid-plane and a significant fraction
of the dust is in large grains. Conclusions: Simultaneous modeling of the gas and dust it is required
to break the model degeneracies and constrain the disk structure. An increasing gas surface density
with radius in the inner dust cavity echoes the effect of a migrating jovian planet. The global low
gas mass (a few MJupiter) in the HD 135344B's disk suggests that it is an evolved disk that has already
lost a large fraction of its mass.
