Observations indicate that nearly all galaxies contain supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at their
centers. When galaxies merge, their component black holes form SMBH binaries (SMBHBs), which emit
low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) that can be detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). We
have searched the recently-released North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational
Waves (NANOGrav) 11-year data set for GWs from individual SMBHBs in circular orbits. As we did not
find strong evidence for GWs in our data, we placed 95\% upper limits on the strength of GWs from such
sources as a function of GW frequency and sky location. We placed a sky-averaged upper limit on the
GW strain of $h_0 < 7.3(3) \times 10^{-15}$ at $f_\mathrm{gw}= 8$ nHz. We also developed a technique
to determine the significance of a particular signal in each pulsar using ``dropout' parameters
as a way of identifying spurious signals in measurements from individual pulsars. We used our upper
limits on the GW strain to place lower limits on the distances to individual SMBHBs. At the most-sensitive
sky location, we ruled out SMBHBs emitting GWs with $f_\mathrm{gw}= 8$ nHz within 120 Mpc for $\mathcal{M}
= 10^9 \, M_\odot$, and within 5.5 Gpc for $\mathcal{M} = 10^{10} \, M_\odot$. We also determined
that there are no SMBHBs with $\mathcal{M} > 1.6 \times 10^9 \, M_\odot$ emitting GWs in the Virgo
Cluster. Finally, we estimated the number of potentially detectable sources given our current
strain upper limits based on galaxies in Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) and merger rates from
the Illustris cosmological simulation project. Only 34 out of 75,000 realizations of the local
Universe contained a detectable source, from which we concluded it was unsurprising that we did
not detect any individual sources given our current sensitivity to GWs.
