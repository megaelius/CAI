Low-frequency radio continuum studies of star-forming edge-on galaxies can help to further understand
how cosmic-ray electrons (CRe) propagate through the interstellar medium into the halo and how
this is affected by energy losses and magnetic fields. Observations with the Very Large Array (VLA)
from Continuum Haloes in Nearby Galaxies - an EVLA Survey (CHANG-ES) are combined with those with
the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS ) to identify the prevailing
mode of cosmic-ray transport in the edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 3556. We mapped the radio spectral
index, magnetic field strength, and orientation using VLA 1.5 and 6 GHz and LOFAR 144 MHz data, and
we fit 1D cosmic-ray propagation models to these maps using Spinnaker (Spectral Index Numerical
Analysis of K(c)osmic-ray electron radio emission) and its interactive wrapper Spinteractive.
We find that the spectral index in the galactic midplane is, as expected for young CRe, alpha ~ -0.7
and steepens towards the halo of the galaxy as a consequence of spectral ageing. The intensity scale
heights are about 1.4 and 1.9 kpc for the thin disc, and 3.3 and 5.9 kpc for the thick disc at 1.5 GHz and
144 MHz, respectively. While pure diffusion cannot explain our data, advection can, particularly
if we assume a linearly accelerating wind. Our best-fitting model has an initial speed of 123 km s^-1
in the galactic midplane and reaches the escape velocity at heights between 5 kpc and 15 kpc above
the disc, depending on the assumed dark matter halo of the galaxy. This galactic wind scenario is
corroborated by the existence of vertical filaments seen both in the radio continuum and in H alpha
in the disc-halo interface and of a large-scale reservoir of hot, X-ray emitting gas in the halo.
Radio haloes show the existence of galactic winds, possibly driven by cosmic rays, in typical star-forming
spiral galaxies.
