Observations of relaxed, massive and distant clusters can provide important tests of standard
cosmological models e.g. using the gas mass fraction. We study the very luminous, high redshift
($z=0.902$) galaxy cluster ClJ120958.9+495352 using XMM-Newton data and measure the temperature
profile and cooling time to investigate the dynamical status with respect to the presence of a cool
core as well as global cluster properties. We use HST weak lensing data to estimate its total mass
and determine the gas mass fraction. We perform a spectral analysis using an XMM-Newton observation
of 15ks cleaned exposure time. As the treatment of the background is crucial, we use two different
approaches to account for the background emission to verify our results. We account for point-spread-function
effects and deproject our results to estimate the gas mass fraction of the cluster. We measure weak
lensing galaxy shapes from mosaic HST/ACS imaging and select background galaxies photometrically
in combination with WHT/ACAM imaging. The X-ray luminosity of ClJ120958.9+495352 in the 0.1-2.4keV
band estimated from our XMM-Newton data is $L_X = (18.7_{-1.2}^{+1.3})\times10^{44}$erg/s and
thus it is one of the most X-ray luminous clusters known at similarly high redshift. We find clear
indications for the presence of a cool core from the temperature profile and the central cooling
time, which is very rare at such high redshifts. Based on the weak lensing analysis we estimate a cluster
mass of $M_\mathrm{500}/10^{14}M_\odot=4.4^{+2.2}_{-2.0}(\mathrm{stat.})\pm0.6(\mathrm{sys.})$
and a gas mass fraction of $f_\mathrm{gas,2500} = 0.11_{-0.03}^{+0.06}$ in good agreement with
previous findings for high redshift and local clusters.
