In April 2016, the Rosetta spacecraft performed a low-altitude low-phase-angle flyby over the
Imhotep-Khepry transition of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's nucleus. The OSIRIS/Narrow-Angle-Camera
(NAC) acquired 112 images with mainly 3 broadband filters in the visible at a resolution of up to 0.53
m/px and for phase angles between 0.095{\deg} and 62{\deg}. Using those images, we have investigated
the morphological and spectrophotometrical properties of this area. We assembled the images into
coregistered color cubes. Using a 3D shape model, we produced the illumination conditions and georeference
for each image. We projected the observations on a map to investigate its geomorphology. Observations
were photometrically corrected using the Lommel-Seeliger disk law. Spectrophotometric analyses
were performed on the coregistered color cubes. These data were used to estimate the local phase
reddening. This region of the nucleus hosts numerous and varied types of terrains and features.
We observe an association between a feature's nature, its reflectance, and its spectral slope.
Fine material deposits exhibit an average reflectance and spectral slope, while terrains with
diamictons, consolidated material, degraded outcrops, or features such as somber boulders, present
a lower-than-average reflectance and higher-than-average spectral slope. Bright surfaces present
here a spectral behavior consistent with terrains enriched in water-ice. We find a phase-reddening
slope of 0.064{\pm}0.001{\%}/100nm/{\deg} at 2.7 au outbound, similarly to the one obtained at
2.3 au inbound during the February 2015 flyby. Identified as the source region of multiple jets and
a host of water-ice material, the Imhotep-Khepry transition appeared in April 2016, close to the
frost line, to further harbor several potential locations with exposed water-ice material among
its numerous different morphological terrain units.
