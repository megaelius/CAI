We investigate the launching mechanism of relativistic jets from black hole sources, in particular
the strong winds from the surrounding accretion disk. Numerical investigations of the disk wind
launching - the simulation of the accretion-ejection transition - have so far almost only been done
for non-relativistic systems. From these simulations we know that resistivity, or magnetic diffusivity,
plays an important role for the launching process. Here, we extend this treatment to general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics (GR-MHD) applying the resistive GR-MHD code rHARM. Our model setup considers
a thin accretion disk threaded by a large-scale open magnetic field. We run a series of simulations
with different Kerr parameter, field strength and diffusivity level. Indeed we find strong disk
winds with, however, mildly relativistic speed, the latter most probably due to our limited computational
domain. Further, we find that magnetic diffusivity lowers the efficiency of accretion and ejection,
as it weakens the efficiency of the magnetic lever arm of the disk wind. As major driving force of the
disk wind we disentangle the toroidal magnetic field pressure gradient, however,magneto-centrifugal
driving may also contribute. Black hole rotation in our simulations suppresses the accretion rate
due to an enhanced toroidal magnetic field pressure that seems to be induced by frame-dragging.
Comparing the energy fluxes from the Blandford-Znajek-driven central spine and the surrounding
disk wind, we find that the total electromagnetic energy flux is dominated by the total matter energy
flux of the disk wind (by a factor 20). The kinetic energy flux of the matter outflow is comparatively
small and comparable to the Blandford-Znajek electromagnetic energy flux.
