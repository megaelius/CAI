This work presents theoretical studies which combine aspects of combustion and explosion theory
with exoplanetary atmospheric science. Super Earths could possess a large amount of molecular
hydrogen depending on disk, planetary and stellar properties. Super Earths orbiting pre-main
sequence-M-dwarf stars have been suggested to possess large amounts of O2 produced abiotically
via water photolysis followed by hydrogen escape . If these two constituents were present simultaneously,
such large amounts of H2 and O2 can react via photochemistry to form up to about 10 Earth oceans. In
cases where photochemical removal is slow so that O2 can indeed build up abiotically, the atmosphere
could reach the combustion explosion limit. Then, H2 and O2 react extremely quickly to form water
together with modest amounts of hydrogen peroxide. These processes set constraints for H2 O2 atmospheric
compositions in Super Earth atmospheres. Our initial study of the gas-phase oxidation pathways
for modest conditions with Earth insolation and about a tenth of a percent of H2 suggests that H2 is
oxidized by O2 into H2O mostly via HOx and mixed HOx NOx catalyzed cycles. Regarding other atmospheric
species-pairs we find that CO,O2 mixtures could attain explosive combustive levels on mini gas
planets for mid range for the C to O ratio in the equilibrium chemistry regime for p more than about
1bar. Regarding CH4,O2 mixtures, a small number of modeled rocky planets assuming Earth like atmospheres
orbiting cooler stars could have compositions at or near the explosive combustive level although
more work is required to investigate this issue.
