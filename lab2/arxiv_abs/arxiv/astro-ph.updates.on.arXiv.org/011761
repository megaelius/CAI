We describe a population of young star clusters (SCs) formed in a hydrodynamical simulation of a
gas-rich dwarf galaxy merger resolved with individual massive stars at sub-parsec spatial resolution.
The simulation is part of the \textsc{griffin} (Galaxy Realizations Including Feedback From INdividual
massive stars) project. The star formation environment during the simulation spans seven orders
of magnitude in gas surface density and thermal pressure, and the global star formation rate surface
density ($\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$) varies by more than three orders of magnitude during the simulation.
Young SCs more massive than $M_{\mathrm{*,cl}}\sim 10^{2.5}\,M_{\odot}$ form along a mass function
with a power-law index $\alpha\sim-1.7$ ($\alpha\sim-2$ for $M_{\mathrm{*,cl}}\gtrsim10^{3}\,M_{\odot}$)
at all merger phases, while the normalization and the highest SC masses (up to $\sim 10^6 M_{\odot}$)
correlate with $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$. The cluster formation efficiency varies from $\Gamma\sim20\%$
in early merger phases to $\Gamma\sim80\%$ at the peak of the starburst and is compared to observations
and model predictions. The massive SCs ($\gtrsim10^4\,M_{\odot}$) have sizes and mean surface
densities similar to observed young massive SCs. Simulated lower mass clusters appear slightly
more concentrated than observed. All SCs form on timescales of a few Myr and lose their gas rapidly
resulting in typical stellar age spreads between $\sigma\sim0.1-2$ Myr ($1\sigma$), consistent
with observations. The age spreads increase with cluster mass, with the most massive cluster ($\sim10^6\,
M_{\odot}$) reaching a spread of $5\, \mathrm{Myr}$ once its hierarchical formation finishes.
Our study shows that it is now feasible to investigate the SC population of entire galaxies with novel
high-resolution numerical simulations.
