We present the first stellar spectroscopy in the low-luminosity (M_V ~-9.3 mag), dwarf galaxy Leo
P. Its significantly low oxygen abundance (3% solar) and relative proximity (~1.6 Mpc) make it a
unique galaxy to investigate the properties of massive stars with near-primordial compositions
akin to those in the early Universe. From our VLT-MUSE spectroscopy we find the first direct evidence
for an O-type star in the prominent HII region, providing an important test case to investigate the
potential environmental dependence of the upper end of the initial mass function in the dwarf galaxy
regime. We classify 14 further sources as massive stars (and 17 more as candidate massive stars),
most likely B-type objects. From comparisons with published evolutionary models we argue that
the absolute visual magnitudes of massive stars in very metal-poor systems such as Leo P and I Zw 18
may be fainter by ~0.5 mag compared to Galactic stars. We also present spectroscopy of two carbon
stars identified previously as candidate asymptotic-giant-branch stars. Two of three further
candidate asymptotic-giant-branch stars display CaII absorption, confirming them as cool, evolved
stars; we also recover CaII absorption in the stacked data of the next brightest 16 stars in the upper
red giant branch. These discoveries will provide targets for future observations to investigate
the physical properties of these objects and to calibrate evolutionary models of luminous stars
at such low metallicity. The MUSE data also reveal two 100pc-scale ring structures in Halpha emission,
with the HII region located on the northern edge of the southern ring. Lastly, we report serendipitous
observations of 20 galaxies, with redshifts ranging from z=0.39, to a close pair of star-forming
galaxies at z=2.5.
