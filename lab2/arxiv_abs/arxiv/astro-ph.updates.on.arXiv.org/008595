Active galactic nuclei (AGN) that show strong rest-frame optical/UV variability in their blue
continuum and broad line emission are classified as "changing-look" AGN, or at higher luminosities
changing look quasars (CLQs). These surprisingly large and sometimes rapid transitions challenge
accepted models of quasar physics and duty cycles, offer several new avenues for study of quasar
host galaxies, and open a wider interpretation of the cause of differences between broad and narrow
line AGN. To better characterize extreme quasar variability, we present follow-up spectroscopy
as part of a comprehensive search for CLQs across the full SDSS footprint using spectroscopically
confirmed quasars from the SDSS DR7 catalog. Our primary selection requires large-amplitude (|\Delta
g|>1 mag, |\Delta r|>0.5 mag) variability over any of the available time baselines probed by the
SDSS and Pan-STARRS 1 surveys. We employ photometry from the Catalina Sky Survey to verify variability
behavior in CLQ candidates where available, and confirm CLQs using optical spectroscopy from the
William Herschel, MMT, Magellan, and Palomar telescopes. For our adopted S/N threshold on variability
of broad H\beta emission, we find 17 new CLQs, yielding a confirmation rate of >~ 20%. These candidates
are at lower Eddington ratio relative to the overall quasar population which supports a disk-wind
model for the broad line region. Based on our sample, the CLQ fraction increases from 10% to roughly
half as the continuum flux ratio between repeat spectra at 3420 Angstroms increases from 1.5 to 6.
We release a catalog of over 200 highly variable candidates to facilitate future CLQ searches.
