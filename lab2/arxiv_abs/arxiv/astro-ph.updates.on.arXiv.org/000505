Following on after three previous papers discussing the formation of primordial black holes during
the radiative era of the early universe, we present here a further investigation of the critical
nature of the process involved, aimed at making contact with some of the basic underlying ideas from
the literature on critical collapse. We focus on the intermediate state, which we have found appearing
in cases with perturbations close to the critical limit, and examine the connection between this
and the similarity solutions which play a fundamental role in the standard picture of critical collapse.
We have derived a set of self-similar equations for the null-slicing form of the metric which we are
using for our numerical calculations, and have then compared the results obtained by integrating
these with the ones coming from our simulations for collapse of cosmological perturbations within
an expanding universe. We find that the similarity solution is asymptotically approached in a region
which grows to cover both the contracting matter and part of the semi-void which forms outside it.
Our main interest is in the situation relevant for primordial black hole formation in the radiative
era of the early universe, where the relation between the pressure $p$ and the energy density $e$
can be reasonably approximated by an expression of the form $p = we$ with $w=1/3$. However, we have
also looked at other values of $w$, both because these have been considered in previous literature
and also because they can be helpful for giving further insight into situations relevant for primordial
black hole formation. As in our previous work, we have started our simulations with initial supra-horizon
scale perturbations of a type which could have come from inflation.
