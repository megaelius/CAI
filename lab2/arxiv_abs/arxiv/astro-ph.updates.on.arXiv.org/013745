The light-cone (LC) effect causes the mean as well as the statistical properties of the redshifted
21-cm signal $T_{\rm b}(\hat{\bf n},\nu)$ to change with frequency $\nu$ (or cosmic time). Consequently,
the statistical homogeneity (ergodicity) of the signal along the line of sight (LoS) direction
is broken. This is a severe problem particularly during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) when the
mean neutral hydrogen fraction ($\bar{x}_{\rm HI}$) changes rapidly as the universe evolves.
This will also pose complications for large bandwidth observations. These effects imply that the
3D power spectrum $P(k)$ fails to quantify the entire second-order statistics of the signal as it
assumes the signal to be ergodic and periodic along the LoS. As a proper alternative to $P(k)$, we
use the multi-frequency angular power spectrum (MAPS) ${\mathcal C}_{\ell}(\nu_1,\nu_2)$ which
does not assume the signal to be ergodic and periodic along the LoS. Here, we study the prospects for
measuring the EoR 21-cm MAPS using future observations with the upcoming SKA-Low. Ignoring any
contribution from the foregrounds, we find that the EoR 21-cm MAPS can be measured at a confidence
level $\ge 5\sigma$ at angular scales $\ell \sim 1300$ for total observation time $t_{\rm obs} \ge
128\,{\rm hrs}$ across $\sim 44\,{\rm MHz}$ observational bandwidth. We also quantitatively
address the effects of foregrounds on MAPS detectability forecast by avoiding signal contained
within the foreground wedge in $(k_\perp, k_\parallel)$ plane. These results are very relevant
for the upcoming large bandwidth EoR experiments as previous predictions were all restricted to
individually analyzing the signal over small frequency (or equivalently redshift) intervals.
