$Context$. The mean pressure profile of the galaxy cluster population plays an essential role in
cosmological analyses. An accurate characterization of the shape, intrinsic scatter, and redshift
evolution of this profile is necessary to estimate some of the biases and systematic effects that
currently prevent cosmological analyses based on thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) surveys from
obtaining precise and unbiased cosmological constraints. This is one of the main goals of the ongoing
NIKA2 SZ large program, which aims at mapping the tSZ signal of a representative cluster sample selected
from the $Planck$ and ACT catalogs and spans a redshift range $0.5 < z < 0.9$. $Aims$. To estimate the
impact of intracluster medium (ICM) disturbances that can be detected by NIKA2 on the mean pressure
profile of galaxy clusters, we realized a study based on a synthetic cluster sample that is similar
to that of the NIKA2 SZ large program. $Methods$. To reach this goal we employed the hydrodynamical
simulation $Marenostrum~MUltidark~SImulations~of~galaxy~Clusters$ (MUSIC). We simulated
realistic NIKA2 and $Planck$ tSZ observations, which were jointly analyzed to estimate the ICM
pressure profile of each cluster. A comparison of the deprojected profiles with the true radial
profiles directly extracted from the MUSIC simulation allowed us to validate the NIKA2 tSZ pipeline
and to study the impact of ICM disturbances on the characterization of the ICM pressure distribution
even at high redshift. After normalizing each profile by the integrated quantities estimated under
the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis, we evaluated the mean pressure profile of the twin sample
and show that it is compatible with that extracted directly from the MUSIC simulation in the scale
range that can be recovered by NIKA2. We studied the impact of cluster dynamical state on both its
shape and associated scatter. (abridged)
