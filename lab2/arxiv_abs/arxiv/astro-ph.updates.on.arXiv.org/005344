Planets with masses larger than about 0.1 Earth-masses undergo rapid inward migration (type I migration)
in a standard protoplanetary disk. Recent magnetohydrodynamical simulations revealed the presence
of magnetically driven disk winds, which would alter the disk profile and the type I migration in
the close-in region. We investigate orbital evolution of planetary embryos in disks that viscously
evolve under the effects of disk winds. The aim is to discuss effects of altered disk profiles on type
I migration. In addition, we aim to examine whether observed distributions of close-in super-Earths
can be reproduced by simulations that include effects of disk winds. We perform N-body simulations
of super-Earth formation from planetary embryos, in which a recent model for disk evolution is used.
We explore a wide range of parameters and draw general trends. We also carry out N-body simulations
of close-in super-Earth formation from embryos in such disks under various conditions. We find
that the type I migration is significantly suppressed in many cases. Even in cases in which inward
migration occurs, the migration timescale is lengthened to 1 Myr, which mitigates the type I migration
problem. This is because the gas surface density is decreased and has a flatter profile in the close-in
region due to disk winds. We find that when the type I migration is significantly suppressed, planets
undergo late orbital instability during the gas depletion, leading to a non-resonant configuration.
We also find that observed distributions of close-in super-Earths (e.g., period ratio, mass ratio)
can be reproduced. In addition, we show that in some results of simulations, systems with a chain
of resonant planets, like the TRAPPIST-1 system, form.
