We present initial results from the COS and Gemini Mapping the Circumgalactic Medium (CGMCGM $\equiv$
CGM$^{2}$) survey. The CGM$^{2}$ spectroscopic survey consists of 1689 galaxies, all with high-quality
Gemini GMOS spectra suitable for precise redshift measurements, within 1 Mpc of twenty-two $z \lesssim
1$ quasars, all with existing S/N$\sim$10 HST-COS G130M$+$G160M spectra. We show that the HI covering
fraction above a threshold of $N_{\rm HI}$ $>10^{14} $cm$^{-2}$ is $\gtrsim 0.6$ within 1.5 virial
radii ($R_{\rm vir} \sim R_{200m}$) of galaxies having stellar masses $10^{8} M_{\odot} < M_{\star}
< 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. We examine the kinematics of the HI absorption relative to the galaxy systemic
velocities and find that the majority of absorption lies within $\pm$ 250 km s$^{-1}$, and that this
concentration increases with increasing HI column density from $N_{\rm HI}$ $=10^{14} - 10^{17}$
cm$^{-2}$. We examine HI covering fractions over a range of impact parameters to infer a characteristic
size of the CGM, $R^{14}_{\rm CGM}$, as a function of galaxy mass. $R^{14}_{\rm CGM}$ is the impact
parameter at which the probability of observing an absorber with $N_{\rm HI}$ $>$ 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$
is $>$ 50%. In this framework, the radial extent of the CGM of $M_{\star} > 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ galaxies
is $R^{14}_{\rm CGM} = 362_{-72}^{+83}$ kpc or $R^{14}_{\rm CGM} = 1.4R_{\rm vir}$. Lower-mass
galaxies show a smaller physical scale $R^{14}_{\rm CGM} = 281_{-36}^{+42}$ kpc but extend to $R^{14}_{\rm
CGM} = 2.3R_{\rm vir}$. Our analysis suggests that using $R_{\rm vir}$ as a proxy for the characteristic
radius of the CGM likely underestimates its extent, especially for galaxies with $M_{\star} < 10^{10}
M_{\odot}$.
