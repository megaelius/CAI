The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Optical Simulation Testbed (JOST) is a hardware simulator
for wavefront sensing and control designed to produce JWST-like images. A model of the JWST three
mirror anas- tigmat is realized with three lenses in the form of a Cooke triplet, which provides JWST-like
optical quality over a field equivalent to a NIRCam module. An Iris AO hexagonally segmented mirror
stands in for the JWST primary. This setup successfully produces images extremely similar to expected
JWST in-flight point spread functions (PSFs), and NIRCam images from cryotesting, in terms of the
PSF morphology and sampling relative to the diffraction limit. The segmentation of the primary
mirror into subapertures introduces complexity into wavefront sensing and control (WFS&C) of
large space based telescopes like JWST. JOST provides a platform for independent analysis of WFS&C
scenarios for both commissioning and maintenance activities on such ob- servatories. We present
an update of the current status of the testbed including both single field and wide-field alignment
results. We assess the optical quality of JOST over a wide field of view to inform the future imple-
mentation of different wavefront sensing algorithms including the currently implemented Linearized
Algorithm for Phase Diversity (LAPD). JOST complements other work at the Makidon Laboratory at
the Space Telescope Science Institute, including the High-contrast imager for Complex Aperture
Telescopes (HiCAT) testbed, that investigates coronagraphy for segmented aperture telescopes.
Beyond JWST we intend to use JOST for WFS&C studies for future large segmented space telescopes such
as LUVOIR.
