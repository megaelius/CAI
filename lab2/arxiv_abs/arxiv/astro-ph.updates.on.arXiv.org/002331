We examine a well resolved 8 arcsec lensed image that is symmetrically bent in the middle by an edge-on
lenticular galaxy, in the Hubble Frontier Field (HFF) data of MACSJ0416.1-20403. The lengthy image
is generated primarily by the large tangential shear of the cluster with a local secondary deflection
by the member galaxy out to a limiting radius of about 18 kpc. The lensing lenticular galaxy is also
well resolved and evidently lies nearly edge-on in projection. This fortuitous combination of
a long arc intersecting an edge on galaxy provides us with an opportunity to place relatively strong
constraints on the lensing effect of this galaxy. We can model the stellar lensing contribution
using the observed pixels belonging to the galaxy, in 2D, and we add to this a standard parameterised
dark halo component. Irrespective of the detailed choice of parameters we obtain a combined total
mass of about 3E11 Msun. Depending on the dark halo parameters, the stellar contribution to this
is limited to the range 5-15E10 Msun or 20-50 percent of the total mass, in good agreement with the
independent stellar mass computed from the photometry of 5E10 Msun for a Chabrier IMF, or 8E10Msun
for a Salpeter IMF. The major axis of the DM halo is constrained to be nearly orthogonal to the plane
of the galaxy, within a range of about 15 degrees, and with an ellipticity e=015 corresponding to
an axis ratio a/c=0.54. We show that these conclusions are very weakly dependent on the model of the
cluster, or the additional influence of neighbouring galaxies or the properties of the lensed source.
Alternative theories of gravity where the radial dependence is modified to avoid the need for DM
are challenged by this finding since generically these must be tied to the baryonic component which
here is a stellar disk oriented nearly orthogonally to the lensed image deflection.
