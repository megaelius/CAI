We present structural parameters from a wide-field homogeneous imaging survey of Milky Way satellites
carried out with the MegaCam imagers on the 3.6m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and 6.5m
Magellan-Clay telescope. Our survey targets an unbiased sample of "outer halo" satellites (i.e.,
substructures having Galactocentric distances greater than 25 kpc) and includes classical dSph
galaxies, ultra-faint dwarfs, and remote globular clusters. We combine deep, panoramic $gr$ imaging
for 44 satellites and archival $gr$ imaging for 14 additional objects (primarily obtained with
the DECam instrument as part of the Dark Energy Survey), to measure photometric and structural parameters
for 58 outer halo satellites. This is the largest and most uniform analysis of Milky Way satellites
undertaken to date and represents roughly three quarters ($58/81 \simeq$72\%) of all known outer
halo satellites. We use a maximum-likelihood method to fit four density laws to each object in our
survey: exponential, Plummer, King and Sersic models. We examine systematically the isodensity
contour maps and color magnitude diagrams for each of our program objects, present a comparison
with previous results, and tabulate our best-fit photometric and structural parameters, including
ellipticities, position angles, effective radii, Sersic indices, absolute magnitudes, and surface
brightness measurements. We investigate the distribution of outer halo satellites in the size-magnitude
diagram, and show that the current sample of outer halo substructures spans a wide range in effective
radius, luminosity and surface brightness, with little evidence for a clean separation into star
cluster and galaxy populations at the faintest luminosities and surface brightnesses.
