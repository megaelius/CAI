Despite their importance as stellar nurseries and the building blocks of galaxies, very little
is known about the formation of the highest mass clusters. The dense clump G0.253+0.016 represents
an example of a clump that may form an Arches-like, high-mass cluster. Here we present molecular
line maps toward G0.253+0.016 taken as part of the MALT90 molecular line survey, complemented with
APEX observations. Combined, these data reveal the global physical properties and kinematics
of G0.253+0.016. Recent Herschel data show that while the dust temperature is low (~19 K) toward
its centre, the dust temperature on the exterior is higher (~27 K) due to external heating. Our new
molecular line data reveal that, overall, the morphology of dense gas detected toward G0.253+0.016
matches very well its IR extinction and dust continuum emission. An anti-correlation between the
dust and gas column densities toward its centre indicates that the clump is centrally condensed
with a cold, dense interior in which the molecular gas is chemically depleted. The velocity field
shows a strong gradient along the clump's major axis, with the blue-shifted side at higher Galactic
longitude. The optically thick gas tracers are systematically red-shifted with respect to the
optically thin and hot gas tracers, indicating radial motions. The gas kinematics and line ratios
support the recently proposed scenario in which G0.253+0.016 results from a tidal compression
during a recent pericentre passage near SgrA*. Because G0.253+0.016 represents an excellent example
of a clump that may form a high-mass cluster, its detailed study should reveal a wealth of knowledge
about the early stages of cluster formation.
