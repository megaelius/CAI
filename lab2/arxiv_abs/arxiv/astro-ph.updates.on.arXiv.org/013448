We consider the published distance moduli to the Fornax and Coma galaxy clusters, with emphasis
on the period since 1990. We have carefully homogenized our catalogs of distance moduli onto the
distance scale established in the previous papers in this series. We assessed systematic differences
associated with the use of specific tracers, and discarded results based on application of the Tully--Fisher
relation and of globular cluster and planetary nebula luminosity functions. We recommend `best'
weighted relative distance moduli for the Fornax and Coma clusters with respect to the Virgo cluster
of $\Delta (m-M)_0^{\rm Fornax - Virgo} = 0.18 \pm 0.28 $ mag and $\Delta (m-M)_0^{\rm Coma - Virgo}
= 3.75 \pm 0.23$ mag. The set of weighted mean distance moduli (distances) we derived as most representative
of the clusters' distances is, \begin{eqnarray} (m-M)_0^{\rm Fornax} &=& 31.41 \pm 0.15 \mbox{
mag } (D = 19.1^{+1.4}_{-1.2} \mbox{ Mpc) and} \nonumber &=& 31.21 \pm 0.28 \mbox{ mag } (D = 17.5^{+2.4}_{-2.2}
\mbox{ Mpc)}; \nonumber \\ (m-M)_0^{\rm Coma} &=& 34.99 \pm 0.38 \mbox{ mag } (D = 99.5^{+19.0}_{-15.9}
\mbox{ Mpc) and} \nonumber &=& 34.78 \pm 0.27 \mbox{ mag } (D = 90.4^{+11.9}_{-10.6} \mbox{ Mpc)},
\nonumber \end{eqnarray} where the first value for each cluster is the result of our analysis of
the direct distance moduli, while the second modulus is based on distance moduli relative to the
Virgo cluster. The absolute and relative distance moduli for both clusters are mutually consistent
within the uncertainties; the relative distance moduli yield shorter distances by $\sim$1$\sigma$.
Lingering uncertainties in the underlying absolute distance scale appear to have given rise to
a systematic uncertainty on the order of 0.20 mag.
