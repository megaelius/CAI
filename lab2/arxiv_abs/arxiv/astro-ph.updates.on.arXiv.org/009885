Scientific research is a continuous process, and the speed of future progress can be estimated by
the pace of finding explanations for previous research questions. In this observers based view
of stellar pulsation and asteroseismology, we start with the earliest observations of variable
stars and the techniques used to observe them. The earliest variable stars were large amplitude,
radial pulsators but were followed by other classes of pulsating stars. As the field matured, we
outline some cornerstones of research into pulsating star research with an emphasis on changes
in observational techniques. Improvements from photographs, to photometry, CCDs, and space telescopes
allowed researchers to separate out pulsating stars from other stars with light variations, recognize
radial and nonradial pulsation courtesy of increased measurement precision, and then use nonradial
pulsations to look inside the stars, which cannot be done any other way. We follow several highlighted
problems to show that even with excellent space data, there still may not be quick theoretical explanations.
As the result of technical changes, the structure of international organizations devoted to pulsating
stars has changed, and an increasing number of conferences specialized to space missions or themes
are held. Although there are still many unsolved problems, such as mode identification in non-asymptotic
pulsating stars, the large amount of data with unprecedented precision provided by space missions
(MOST, CoRoT, Kepler) and upcoming missions allow us to use asteroseismology to its full potential.
However, the enormous flow of data will require new techniques to extract the science before the
next missions. The future of asteroseismology will be successful if we learn from the past and improve
with improved techniques, space missions, and a properly educated new generation.
