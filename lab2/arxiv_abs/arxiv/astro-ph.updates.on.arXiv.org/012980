We present predictions for high redshift ($z=2-10$) galaxy populations based on the IllustrisTNG
simulation suite and a full Monte Carlo dust radiative transfer post-processing. Specifically,
we discuss the ${\rm H}_{\alpha}$ and ${\rm H}_{\beta}$ + $[\rm O \,III]$ luminosity functions
up to $z=8$. The predicted ${\rm H}_{\beta}$ + $[\rm O \,III]$ luminosity functions are consistent
with present observations at $z\lesssim 3$ with $\lesssim 0.1\,{\rm dex}$ differences in luminosities.
However, the predicted ${\rm H}_{\alpha}$ luminosity function is $\sim 0.3\,{\rm dex}$ dimmer
than the observed one at $z\simeq 2$. Furthermore, we explore continuum spectral indices, the Balmer
break at $4000$\AA (D4000) and the UV continuum slope $\beta$. The median D4000 versus sSFR relation
predicted at $z=2$ is in agreement with the local calibration despite a different distribution
pattern of galaxies in this plane. In addition, we reproduce the observed $A_{\rm UV}$ versus $\beta$
relation and explore its dependence on galaxy stellar mass, providing an explanation for the observed
complexity of this relation. We also find a deficiency in heavily attenuated, UV red galaxies in
the simulations. Finally, we provide predictions for the dust attenuation curves of galaxies at
$z=2-6$ and investigate their dependence on galaxy colors and stellar masses. The attenuation
curves are steeper in galaxies at higher redshifts, with bluer colors, or with lower stellar masses.
We attribute these predicted trends to dust geometry. Overall, our results are consistent with
present observations of high redshift galaxies. Future JWST observations will further test these
predictions.
