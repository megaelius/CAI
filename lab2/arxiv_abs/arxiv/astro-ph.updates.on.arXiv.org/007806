Context. Despite the recent discovery of spiral-shaped features in protoplanetary discs in the
near-infrared and millimetric wavelengths, there is still an active discussion to understand
how they formed. In fact, the spiral waves observed in discs around young stars can be due to different
physical mechanisms: planet/companion torques, gravitational perturbations or illumination
effects. Aims. We study the spirals formed in the gaseous phase due to two diametrically opposed
shadows cast at fixed disc locations. The shadows are created by an inclined non-precessing disc
inside the cavity, which is assumed to be optically thick. In particular, we analyse the effect of
these spirals on the dynamics of the dust particles and discuss their detectability in transition
discs. Methods. We perform gaseous hydrodynamical simulations with shadows, then we compute the
dust evolution on top of the gaseous distribution, and finally we produce synthetic ALMA observations
of the dust emission based on radiative transfer calculations. Results. Our main finding is that
mm- to cm-sized dust particles are efficiently trapped inside the shadow-triggered spirals. We
also observe that particles of various sizes starting at different stellocentric distances are
well mixed inside these pressure maxima. This dynamical effect would favour grain growth and affect
the resulting composition of planetesimals in the disc. In addition, our radiative transfer calculations
show spiral patterns in the disc at 1.6 {\mu}m and 1.3 mm. Due to their faint thermal emission (compared
to the bright inner regions of the disc) the spirals cannot be detected with ALMA. Our synthetic observations
prove however that shadows are observable as dips in the thermal emission.
