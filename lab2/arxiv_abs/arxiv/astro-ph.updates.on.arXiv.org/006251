Major mergers are popularly considered too destructive to produce the relaxed regular structures
and the morphological inner components (ICs) usually observed in lenticular (S0) galaxies. We
aim to test if major mergers can produce remnants with realistic S0 morphologies. We have selected
a sample of relaxed discy remnants resulting from the dissipative merger simulations of the GalMer
database and derived their properties mimicking the typical conditions of current observational
data. We compare their global morphologies, visual components, and merger relics in mock photometric
images with their real counterparts. Only $\sim$1-2 Gyr after the full merger, we find that: 1) many
remnants (67 major and 29 minor events) present relaxed structures and typical S0 or E/S0 morphologies,
for a wide variety of orbits and even in gas-poor cases. 2) Contrary to popular expectations, most
of them do not exhibit any morphological traces of their past merger origin under typical observing
conditions and at distances as nearby as 30 Mpc. 3) The merger relics are more persistent in minor
mergers than in major ones for similar relaxing time periods. 4) No major-merger S0-like remnant
develops a significant bar. 5) Nearly 58% of the major-merger S0 remnants host visually detectable
ICs, such as embedded inner discs, rings, pseudo-rings, inner spirals, nuclear bars, and compact
sources, very frequent in real S0s too. 6) All remnants contain a lens or oval, identically ubiquitous
in local S0s. 7) These lenses and ovals do not come from bar dilution in major merger cases, but are
associated with stellar halos or embedded inner discs instead (thick or thin). We conclude that
the relaxed morphologies, lenses, ovals, and other ICs of real S0s do not necessarily come from internal
secular evolution, gas infall or environmental mechanisms, as traditionally assumed, but they
can result from major mergers as well.
