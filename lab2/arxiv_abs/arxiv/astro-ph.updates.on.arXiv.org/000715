Recent observations of quasars powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) out to z > 7 constrain
both the initial seed masses and the growth of the most massive black holes (BHs) in the early universe.
Here we elucidate the implications of the radiative feedback from early generations of stars and
from BH accretion for popular models for the formation and growth of seed BHs. We show that by properly
accounting for (1) the limited role of mergers in growing seed BHs as inferred from cosmological
simulations of early star formation and radiative feedback, (2) the sub-Eddington accretion rates
of BHs expected at the earliest times, and (3) the large radiative efficiencies (e_rad) of the most
massive BHs inferred from observations of active galactic nuclei at high redshift (e_rad > 0.1),
we are led to the conclusion that the initial BH seeds may have been as massive as > 10^5 M_Sun. This
presents a strong challenge to the Population III seed model, which calls for seed masses of ~ 100
M_Sun and, even with constant Eddington-limited accretion, requires e_rad < 0.09 to explain
the highest-z SMBHs in today's standard LambdaCDM cosmological model. It is, however, consistent
with the prediction of the direct collapse scenario of SMBH seed formation, in which a supermassive
primordial star forms in a region of the universe with a high molecule-dissociating background
radiation field, and collapses directly into a 10^4--10^6 M_Sun seed BH. These results corroborate
recent cosmological simulations and observational campaigns which suggest that these massive
BHs were the seeds of a large fraction of the SMBHs residing in the centers of galaxies today.
