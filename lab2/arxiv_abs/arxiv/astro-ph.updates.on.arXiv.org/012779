Dust and ice mantles on dust grains play an important role in various processes in protoplanetary
disks (PPDs) around a young star, including planetesimal formation, surface chemistry, and being
the reservoir of water in habitable zones. In this paper, we will perform two-dimensional modeling
of rotational disruption of dust grains and ice mantles due to centrifugal force within suprathermally
rotating grains spun-up by radiative torques for disks around T-Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be stars. We
first study rotational disruption of large composite grains and find that large aggregates could
be disrupted into individual nanoparticles via the RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD) mechanism.
We then study rotational desorption of ice mantles and ro-thermal desorption of molecules from
the ice mantle. We will show that ice mantles in the warm surface layer and above of the disk can be disrupted
into small icy fragments, followed by rapid evaporation of molecules. We suggest that the rotational
disruption mechanism can replenish the ubiquitous presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrogen (PAHs)/
nanoparticles in the hot surface layers of PPDs as observed in mid-IR emission, which are presumably
destroyed by extreme ultraviolet (UV) stellar photons. We show that the water snowline is more extended
in the presence of rotational desorption, which would decrease the number of gaseous planets and
comets but increase the number of rocky planets and asteroids formed in the solar nebula. Finally,
we suggest that the more efficient breakup of carbonaceous grains than silicates by RATD might resolve
the carbon deficit problem measured on the Earth and rocky bodies.
