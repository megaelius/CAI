In a previous work, we studied rotational dynamics of nanoparticles in stationary C-shocks and
identified a new destruction mechanism for suprathermally rotating nanoparticles due to centrifugal
force so-called rotational disruption. In this paper, we extend our study for non-stationary shocks
driven by outflows and young supernovae remnants that have dynamical ages shorter than the time
required for a C-shock to reach the steady state, which is composed of a C-shock and a J-shock tail
(referred as non-stationary CJ-shocks). We find that, in the both C-shock and J-shock components,
smallest nanoparticles (size less than 1 nm) of weak materials can be rotationally disrupted by
centrifugal force due to extremely fast rotation. We then model spinning dust emission from spinning
nanoparticles by accounting for rotational disruption in this non-stationary CJ-shock. We find
that spinning nanoparticles can emit strong microwave radiation and suggest a new method to trace
nanoparticles and shock velocities in dense molecular outflows using microwave emission from
spinning dust. Finally, we discuss two new ways that can return molecules from the nanoparticle
surface to the gas in the shocks, including thermal evaporation and rotational desorption. The
first process relies on the fact that nanoparticles of low heat capacity can be heated to high temperatures,
which is sufficient to evaporate icy species to the gas phase. The second process, rotational desorption,
applied to strong nanoparticles of high tensile strength that can withstand rotational disruption,
occurs when the centrifugal force acting on molecules exceeds its binding force to the grain surface.
These two new mechanisms may play an important role in chemistry in shocks because of dominant surface
area of nanoparticles.
