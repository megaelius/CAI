Most of the visible matter in the Universe is ionized, so that cosmic magnetic fields are quite easy
to generate and due to the lack of magnetic monopoles hard to destroy. Magnetic fields have been measured
in or around practically all celestial objects, either by in-situ measurements of spacecrafts
or by the electromagnetic radiation of embedded cosmic rays, gas, or dust. The Earth, the Sun, solar
planets, stars, pulsars, the Milky Way, nearby galaxies, more distant (radio) galaxies, quasars,
and even intergalactic space in clusters of galaxies have significant magnetic fields, and even
larger volumes of the Universe may be permeated by 'dark' magnetic fields. Information on cosmic
magnetic fields has increased enormously as the result of the rapid development of observational
methods, especially in radio astronomy. In the Milky Way, a wealth of magnetic phenomena was discovered
that are only partly related to objects visible in other spectral ranges. The large-scale structure
of the Milky Way's magnetic field is still under debate. The available data for external galaxies
can well be explained by field amplification and ordering via the dynamo mechanism. The measured
field strengths and the similarity of field patterns and flow patterns of the diffuse ionized gas
give strong indication that galactic magnetic fields are dynamically important. They may affect
the formation of spiral arms, outflows, and the general evolution of galaxies. In spite of our increasing
knowledge on magnetic fields, many important questions on the origin and evolution of magnetic
fields, like their first occurrence in young galaxies, or the existence of large-scale intergalactic
fields remained unanswered. The present upgrades of existing instruments and several radio astronomy
projects have defined cosmic magnetism as one of their key science projects.
