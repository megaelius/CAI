Nanosatellites, and especially CubeSats, at low earth orbits (LEOs) are a low cost option for monitoring
atmospheric and environmental conditions around Earth. For instance, data for weather forecast
reports can be obtained periodically with these kind of small satellites. Therefore, to academic
institutions, universities, etc., this fact makes nanosatellites a very attractive way for researching
with a moderate budget. In this project we compute orbital lifetimes (or simply lifetimes) for hypothetical
missions involving nanosatellites at LEO, focusing our attention on exploring regions along the
equatorial line. Thus, in the framework of orbital mechanics, we show the viability for these kind
of missions in a long and a short term. Applications are projected for countries in northern South
America, central Africa and islands/countries in southern Asia. To compute lifetimes, we take
into account three effects: i) gravitational, ii) Earth deformations and iii) atmospheric density.
These effects are included in the motion equation for a nanosatellite around Earth. After solving
this equation for initial altitudes in 200-800 km above mean sea level (AMSL), we compute and report
flight times to arrive at 150 km AMSL. These results are defined here as lifetimes and they are calculated
for different atmospheric-density profiles according to experimental data and estimations.
In conclusion, we find lowest and highest lifetimes for hypothetical missions involving small
satellites at LEO orbiting along the equatorial line, and propose upper limits for density relative
uncertainties in order to estimate reliable lifetimes.
