Young close binaries clear central cavities in their surrounding circumbinary disk from which
the stars can still accrete material. This process takes place within the very first astronomical
units, and is still not well constrained as the observational evidence has been gathered, until
now, only by means of spectroscopy. The young object HD200775 (MWC361) is a massive spectroscopic
binary (separation of ~15.9mas, ~5.0~AU), with uncertain classification (early/late Be), that
shows a strong and variable Halpha emission. We aim to study the mechanisms that produce the Halpha
line at the AU-scale. Combining the radial velocity measurements and astrometric data available
in the literature, we determined new orbital parameters. With the VEGA instrument on the CHARA array,
we spatially and spectrally resolved the Halpha emission of HD200775, at low and medium spectral
resolutions (R~1600 and 5000) over a full orbital period (~3.6 years). We observe that the Halpha
equivalent width varies with the orbital phase, and increases close to periastron, as expected
from theoretical models that predict an increase of the mass transfer from the circumbinary disk
to the primary disk. In addition, using spectral visibilities and differential phases, we find
marginal variations of the typical extent of the Halpha emission (at 1 to 2-sigma level) and location
(at 1 to 5-sigma level). The spatial extent of the Halpha emission, as probed by a Gaussian FWHM, is
minimum at the ascending node (0.67+/-0.20 mas, i.e., 0.22+/-0.06 AU), and more than doubles at
periastron. In addition, the Gaussian photocenter is slightly displaced in the direction opposite
to the secondary, ruling out the scenario in which all or most of the Halpha emission is due to accretion
onto the secondary. These findings, together with the wide Halpha line profile, may be due to a non-spherical
wind enhanced at periastron.
