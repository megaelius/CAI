We analyze the transit timing variations obtained by the Kepler mission for 22 sub-jovian planet
pairs (17 published, 5 new) that lie close to mean motion resonances. We find that the TTV phases for
most of these pairs lie close to zero, consistent with an eccentricity distribution that has a very
low RMS value of e ~ 0.01; but about a quarter of the pairs possess much higher eccentricities, up to
0.1 - 0.4. For the low-eccentricity pairs, we are able to statistically remove the effect of eccentricity
to obtain planet masses from TTV data. These masses, together with those measured by radial velocity,
yield a best fit mass-radius relation M~3 M_E (R/R_E). This corresponds to a constant surface escape
velocity of 20km/s. We separate the planets into two distinct groups, "mid-sized" (those greater
than 3 R_E), and "compact" (those smaller). All mid-sized planets are found to be less dense than
water and therefore contain extensive H/He envelopes, likely comparable in mass to that of their
cores. We argue that these planets have been significantly sculpted by photoevaporation. Surprisingly,
mid-sized planets are discovered exclusively around stars more massive than 0.8 M_sun. The compact
planets, on the other hand, are often denser than water. Combining our density measurements with
those from radial velocity studies, we find that hotter compact planets tend to be denser, with the
hottest ones reaching rock density. Moreover, hotter planets tend to be smaller in sizes. These
results can be explained if the compact planets are made of rocky cores overlaid with a small amount
of hydrogen, < 1% in mass, with water contributing little to their masses or sizes. Photoevaporation
has exposed bare rocky cores in cases of the hottest planets. Our conclusion that these planets are
likely not water-worlds contrasts with some previous studies.
