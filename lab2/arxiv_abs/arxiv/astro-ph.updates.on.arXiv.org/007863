For 3 radio-loud $\gamma$-ray detected Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 ($\gamma$-ray NLSy1) galaxies,
we report optical variability on intra-night and/or week-like time scales, based on five $\geq$
3 hours long monitoring sessions for each galaxy. The radio-loudness factors (R$_{1.4 GHz}$) for
these galaxies, namely 1H 0323$+$342 (z = 0.0629), PKS J1222$+$0413 (z = 0.966) and PKS J1505$+$0326
(z = 0.408) are $\sim$318, $\sim$1534 and $\sim$3364 at 1.4 GHz, respectively. For the most distant
$\gamma$-ray NLSy1, PKS J1222$+$0413, Intra-Night Optical Variability (INOV) characterisation
is presented for the first time. The blazar-like behaviour of the nearest $\gamma$-ray NLSy1 1H
0323$+$342, which showed strong INOV on 4 of the 5 nights, was unexpected in view of its recent reclassification
as `radio intermediate' (R$_{5 GHz}$ $\lesssim$ 25). Its particularly violent INOV is manifested
by two optical outbursts lasting $\sim$ 1 hour, whose rapid brightening phase is shown to imply a
doubling time of $\sim$ 1 hour for the optical synchrotron flux, after (conservatively) deducting
the thermal optical emission contributed by the host galaxy and the Seyfert nucleus. A more realistic
`decontamination' could well reduce substantially the flux doubling time, bringing it still closer
in rapidity to the ultra-fast VHE ($>$ 100 GeV) flares reported for the blazars PKS 1222$+$216 and
PKS 2155$-$304. A large contamination by thermal optical emission may, in fact, be common for NLSy1s
as they are high Eddington rate accretors. The present study further suggests that superluminal
motion in the radio jet could be a robust diagnostic of INOV.
