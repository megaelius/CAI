We have used the HARPS-North high resolution spectrograph ($\mathcal{R}$=115 000) at TNG to observe
one transit of the highly irradiated planet MASCARA-2b/KELT-20b. Using only one transit observation,
we are able to clearly resolve the spectral features of the atomic sodium (Na I) doublet and the H$\alpha$
line in its atmosphere, measuring absorption depths of 0.17$\pm$0.03$\%$ and 0.59$\pm$0.08$\%$
for a 0.75 $\AA$ passband, respectively. These absorptions are corroborated with the transmission
measured from their respective transmission light curves, which show a large Rossiter-McLaughlin
effect. In case of H$\alpha$, this absorption corresponds to an effective radius of $R_{\lambda}/R_P$=1.20$\pm$0.04.
While the S/N of the final transmission spectrum is not sufficient to adjust different temperature
profiles to the lines, we find that higher temperatures than the equilibrium are needed to explain
the lines contrast. Particularly, we find that the Na I lines core require a temperature of T=4210$\pm$180K
and that H$\alpha$ requires T=4330$\pm$520K. MASCARA-2b, like other planets orbiting A-type
stars, receives a large amount of UV energy from its host star. This energy excites the atomic hydrogen
and produces H$\alpha$ absorption, leading to the expansion and abrasion of the atmosphere. The
study of other Balmer lines in the transmission spectrum would allow the determination of the atmospheric
temperature profile and the calculation of the lifetime of the atmosphere. In the case of MASCARA-2b,
residual features are observed in the H$\beta$ and H$\gamma$ lines, but they are not statistically
significant. More transit observations are needed to confirm our findings in Na I and H$\alpha$,
and to build up enough S/N to explore the presence of H$\beta$ and H$\gamma$ planetary absorptions.
