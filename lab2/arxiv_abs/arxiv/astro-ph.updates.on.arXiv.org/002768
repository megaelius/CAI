Dust grains in neutral gas behave as aerodynamic particles, so they can develop large density fluctuations
independent of gas density fluctuations. Specifically, gas turbulence can drive order-of-magnitude
'resonant' fluctuations in the dust on scales where the gas stopping/drag timescale is comparable
to the turbulent eddy turnover time. Here we show that for large grains (size >0.1 micron, containing
most grain mass) in sufficiently large molecular clouds (radii >1-10 pc, masses >10^4 M_sun),
this scale becomes larger than the characteristic sizes of pre-stellar cores (the sonic length),
so large fluctuations in the dust-to-gas ratio are imprinted on cores. As a result, star clusters
and protostellar disks formed in large clouds should exhibit significant abundance spreads in
the elements preferentially found in large grains. This naturally predicts populations of carbon-enhanced
stars, certain highly unusual stellar populations observed in nearby open clusters, and may explain
the 'UV upturn' in early-type galaxies. It will also dramatically change planet formation in the
resulting protostellar disks, by preferentially 'seeding' disks with an enhancement in large
carbonaceous or silicate grains. The relevant threshold for this behavior scales simply with cloud
densities and temperatures, making straightforward predictions for clusters in starbursts and
high-redshift galaxies. Because of the selective sorting by size, this process is not necessarily
visible in extinction mapping. We also predict the shape of the abundance distribution -- when these
fluctuations occur, a small fraction of the cores may actually be seeded with abundances ~100 times
the mean, such that they are almost 'totally metal' (Z~1)! Assuming the cores collapse, these totally
metal stars would be rare (1 in 10^4 in clusters where this occurs), but represent a fundamentally
new stellar evolution channel.
