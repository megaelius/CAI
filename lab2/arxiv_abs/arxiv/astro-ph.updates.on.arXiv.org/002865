Given the current and past star-formation in the Milky Way in combination with the limited gas supply,
the re-fuelling of the reservoir of cool gas is an important aspect of Galactic astrophysics. The
infall of \ion{H}{i} halo clouds can, among other mechanisms, contribute to solving this problem.
We study the intermediate-velocity cloud IVC135+54 and its spatially associated high-velocity
counterpart to look for signs of a past or ongoing interaction. Using the Effelsberg-Bonn \ion{H}{i}
Survey data, we investigated the interplay of gas at different velocities. In combination with
far-infrared Planck and IRIS data, we extended this study to interstellar dust and used the correlation
of the data sets to infer information on the dark gas. The velocity structure indicates a strong compression
and deceleration of the infalling high-velocity cloud (HVC), associated with far-infrared excess
emission in the intermediate-velocity cloud. This excess emission traces molecular hydrogen,
confirming that IVC135+54 is one of the very few molecular halo clouds. The high dust emissivity
of IVC135+54 with respect to the local gas implies that it consists of disk material and does not,
unlike the HVC, have an extragalactic origin. Based on the velocity structure of the HVC and the dust
content of the IVC, a physical connection between them appears to be the logical conclusion. Since
this is not compatible with the distance difference between the two objects, we conclude that this
particular HVC might be much closer to us than complex C. Alternatively, the indicators for an interaction
are misleading and have another origin.
