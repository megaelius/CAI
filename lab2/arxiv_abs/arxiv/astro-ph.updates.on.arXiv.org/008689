Strong galactic bars produced in simulations tend to undergo a period of buckling instability that
weakens and thickens them and forms a boxy/peanut structure in their central parts. This theoretical
prediction has been confirmed by identifying such morphologies in real galaxies. The nature and
origin of this instability remains however poorly understood with some studies claiming it to be
due to fire-hose instability while others relating it to vertical instability of stellar orbits
supporting the bar. One of the channels for the formation of galactic bars is via the interaction
of disky galaxies with perturbers of significant mass. Tidally induced bars offer a unique possibility
of studying buckling instability because their formation can be controlled by changing the strength
of the interaction while keeping the initial structure of the galaxy the same. We use a set of four
simulations of flyby interactions where a galaxy on a prograde orbit forms a bar, which is stronger
for stronger tidal forces. We study their buckling by calculating different kinematic signatures,
including profiles of the mean velocity in vertical direction, as well as distortions of the bars
out of the disk plane. Although our two strongest bars buckle most strongly, there is no direct relation
between the ratio of vertical to horizontal velocity dispersion and the bar's susceptibility to
buckling, as required by the fire-hose instability interpretation. While our weakest bar buckles,
a stronger one does not, its dispersion ratio remains low and it grows to become the strongest of all
at the end of evolution. Instead, we find that during buckling the resonance between the vertical
and radial orbital frequencies becomes wide and therefore able to modify stellar orbits over a significant
range of radii. We conclude that the vertical orbital instability is the more plausible explanation
for the origin of buckling.
