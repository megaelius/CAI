IAU Inter-Commission B2-C1-C2 WG Data-driven Astronomy Education and Public Outreach (DAEPO)
was launched officially in April 2017. With the development of many mega-science astronomical
projects, for example CTA, DESI, EUCLID, FAST, GAIA, JWST, LAMOST, LSST, SDSS, SKA, and large scale
simulations, astronomy has become a Big Data science. Astronomical data is not only necessary resource
for scientific research, but also very valuable resource for education and public outreach (EPO),
especially in the era of Internet and Cloud Computing. IAU WG Data-driven Astronomy Education and
Public Outreach is hosted at the IAU Division B (Facilities, Technologies and Data Science) Commission
B2 (Data and Documentation), and organized jointly with Commission C1 (Astronomy Education and
Development), Commission C2 (Communicating Astronomy with the Public), Office of Astronomy for
Development (OAD), Office for Astronomy Outreach (OAO) and several other non IAU communities,
including IVOA Education Interest Group, American Astronomical Society Worldwide Telescope
Advisory Board, Zooniverse project and International Planetarium Society. The working group
has the major objectives to: Act as a forum to discuss the value of astronomy data in EPO, the advantages
and benefits of data driven EPO, and the challenges facing to data driven EPO; Provide guidelines,
curriculum, data resources, tools, and e-infrastructure for data driven EPO; Provide best practices
of data driven EPO. In the paper, backgrounds, current status and working plans in the future are
introduced. More information about the WG is available at: this http URL
