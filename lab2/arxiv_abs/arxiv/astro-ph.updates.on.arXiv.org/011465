Interactions between convective shells in evolved massive stars have been linked to supernova
impostors, to the production of the odd-Z elements Cl, K, and Sc, and they might also help generate
the large-scale asphericities that are known to facilitate shock revival in supernova explosion
models. We investigate the process of ingestion of C-shell material into a convective O-burning
shell, including the hydrodynamic feedback from the nuclear burning of the ingested material.
Our 3D hydrodynamic simulations span almost 3 dex in the total luminosity $L_\mathrm{tot}$. All
but one of the simulations reach a quasi-stationary state with the entrainment rate and convective
velocity proportional to $L_\mathrm{tot}$ and $L_\mathrm{tot}^{1/3}$, respectively. Carbon
burning provides $14\,$--$\,33\%$ of the total luminosity, depending on the set of reactions considered.
Equivalent simulations done on $768^3$ and $1152^3$ grids are in excellent quantitative agreement.
The flow is dominated by a few large-scale convective cells. An instability leading to large-scale
oscillations with Mach numbers in excess of $0.2$ develops in an experimental run with the energy
yield from C burning increased by a factor of 10. This run represents most closely the conditions
expected in a violent O-C shell merger, which is a potential production site for odd-Z elements such
as K and Sc and which may seed asymmetries in the supernova progenitor. 1D simulations may underestimate
the energy generation from the burning of ingested material by as much as a factor two owing to their
missing the effect of clumpiness of entrained material on the nuclear reaction rate.
