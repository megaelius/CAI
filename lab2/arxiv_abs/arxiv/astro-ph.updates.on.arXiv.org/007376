[Abridged] We combine new CO(1-0) line observations of 24 intermediate redshift galaxies (0.03
< z < 0.28) along with literature data of galaxies at 0<z<4 to explore scaling relations between the
dust and gas content using PAH 6.2 $\mu$m ($L_{6.2}$), CO ($L'_{\rm CO}$), and infrared ($L_{\rm
IR}$) luminosities for a wide range of redshifts and physical environments. Our analysis confirms
the existence of a universal $L_{6.2}-L_{\rm CO}$ correlation followed by normal star-forming
galaxies (SFGs) and starbursts (SBs) at all redshifts. This relation is also followed by local ULIRGs
that appear as outliers in the $L_{6.2}-L_{\rm IR}$ and $L_{\rm IR}-L'_{\rm CO}$ relations from
the sequence defined by normal SFGs. The emerging tight ($\sigma \approx 0.26$ dex) and linear ($\alpha
= 1.03$) relation between $L_{6.2}$ and $L_{\rm CO}$ indicates a $L_{6.2}$ to molecular gas ($M_{\rm
H_2}$) conversion factor of $\alpha_{6.2} = M_{\rm H2}/L_{6.2} = (2.7\pm1.3) \times \alpha_{\rm
CO}$, where $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ is the $L'_{\rm CO}$ to $M_{\rm H_2}$ conversion factor. We also find
that on galaxy integrated scales, PAH emission is better correlated with cold rather than with warm
dust emission, suggesting that PAHs are associated with the diffuse cold dust, which is another
proxy for $M_{\rm H_2}$. Focusing on normal SFGs among our sample, we employ the dust continuum emission
to derive $M_{\rm H_2}$ estimates and find a constant $M_{\rm H_2}/L_{6.2}$ ratio of $\alpha_{6.2}
= 12.3 \ M_{\rm H_2}/{\rm L}_{\odot}$ ($\sigma\approx 0.3$ dex). We propose that the presented
$L_{6.2}-L'_{\rm CO}$ and $L_{6.2}-M_{\rm H_2}$ relations will serve as useful tools for the determination
of the physical properties of high-$z$ SFGs, for which PAH emission will be routinely detected by
the James Webb Space Telescope.
