High-eccentricity migration is an important channel for the formation of hot Jupiters (HJs). In
particular, Lidov-Kozai (LK) oscillations of orbital eccentricity/inclination induced by a
distant planetary or stellar companion, combined with tidal friction, have been shown to produce
HJs on Gyr timescales, provided that efficient tidal dissipation operates in the planet. We re-examine
this scenario with the inclusion of dynamical tides. When the planet's orbit is in a high-eccentricity
phase, the tidal force from the star excites oscillatory f-modes and r-modes in the planet. For sufficiently
large eccentricity and small pericentre distance, the mode can grow chaotically over multiple
pericentre passages and eventually dissipate non-linearly, drawing energy from the orbit and
rapidly shrinking the semi-major axis. We study the effect of such chaotic tides on the planet's
orbital evolution. We find that this pathway produces very eccentric ($e\gtrsim 0.9$) warm Jupiters
(WJs) on short timescales (a few to 100 Myrs). These WJs efficiently circularize to become HJs due
to their persistently small pericentre distances. Chaotic tides can also save some planets from
tidal disruption by truncating the LK eccentricity oscillations, significantly increasing the
HJ formation fraction for a range of planet masses and radii. Using a population synthesis calculation,
we determine the characteristics of WJs and HJs produced in this scenario, including the final period
distribution, orbital inclinations and stellar obliquities. Chaotic tides endow LK migration
with several favorable features to explain observations of HJs. We expect that chaotic tides are
also important in other flavours of high-$e$ migration.
