Observations at 1 au have confirmed that enhancements in measured energetic particle fluxes are
statistically associated with "rough" magnetic fields, i.e., fields having atypically large
spatial derivatives or increments, as measured by the Partial Variance of Increments (PVI) method.
One way to interpret this observation is as an association of the energetic particles with trapping
or channeling within magnetic flux tubes, possibly near their boundaries. However, it remains
unclear whether this association is a transport or local effect; i.e., the particles might have
been energized at a distant location, perhaps by shocks or reconnection, or they might experience
local energization or re-acceleration. The Parker Solar Probe (PSP), even in its first two orbits,
offers a unique opportunity to study this statistical correlation closer to the corona. As a first
step, we analyze the separate correlation properties of the energetic particles measured by the
\isois instruments during the first solar encounter. The distribution of time intervals between
a specific type of event, i.e., the waiting time, can indicate the nature of the underlying process.
We find that the \isois observations show a power-law distribution of waiting times, indicating
a correlated (non-Poisson) distribution. Analysis of low-energy \isois data suggests that the
results are consistent with the 1 au studies, although we find hints of some unexpected behavior.
A more complete understanding of these statistical distributions will provide valuable insights
into the origin and propagation of solar energetic particles, a picture that should become clear
with future PSP orbits.
