Seismology applied to giant planets could drastically change our understanding of their deep interiors,
as it has happened with the Earth, the Sun, and many main-sequence and evolved stars. The study of
giant planets' composition is important for understanding both the mechanisms enabling their
formation and the origins of planetary systems, in particular our own. Unfortunately, its determination
is complicated by the fact that their interior is thought not to be homogeneous, so that spectroscopic
determinations of atmospheric abundances are probably not representative of the planet as a whole.
Instead, the determination of their composition and structure must rely on indirect measurements
and interior models. Giant planets are mostly fluid and convective, which makes their seismology
much closer to that of solar-like stars than that of terrestrial planets. Hence, helioseismology
techniques naturally transfer to giant planets. In addition, two alternative methods can be used:
photometry of the solar light reflected by planetary atmospheres, and ring seismology in the specific
case of Saturn. The current decade has been promising thanks to the detection of Jupiter's acoustic
oscillations with the ground-based imaging-spectrometer SYMPA and indirect detection of Saturn's
f-modes in its rings by the NASA Cassini orbiter. This has motivated new projects of ground-based
and space-borne instruments that are under development. In this chapter, we review the science
that seismology could help understand about the four giant planets, the instrumental and modeling
approaches, and the most recent observational results.
