Maximally Smooth Functions (MSFs) are a form of constrained functions in which there are no inflection
points or zero crossings in high order derivatives. Consequently, they have applications to signal
recovery in experiments where signals of interest are expected to be non-smooth features masked
by larger smooth signals or foregrounds. They can also act as a powerful tool for diagnosing the presence
of systematics. The constrained nature of MSFs makes fitting these functions a non-trivial task.
We introduce maxsmooth, an open source package that uses quadratic programming to rapidly fit MSFs.
We demonstrate the efficiency and reliability of maxsmooth by comparison to commonly used fitting
routines. We show that by using quadratic programming we can reduce the fitting time by approximately
two orders of magnitude. maxsmooth features a built-in library of MSF models and allows the user
to define their own. We also introduce and implement with maxsmooth Partially Smooth Functions,
which are useful for describing elements of non-smooth structure in foregrounds. This work has
been motivated by the problem of foreground modelling in 21-cm cosmology for which MSFs have been
shown to be a viable alternative to polynomials. We discuss applications of maxsmooth to 21-cm cosmology
and highlight this with examples using data from the Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization
Signature (EDGES) and the Large-aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Ages (LEDA) experiments.
MSFs are applied to data from LEDA for the first time in this paper. maxsmooth is pip installable and
