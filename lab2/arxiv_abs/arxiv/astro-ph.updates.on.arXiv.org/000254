We carry out a comprehensive analysis of the possible constraints on cosmological and astrophysical
parameters achievable with measurements of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) power spectrum
from upcoming full-sky CMB observations, with a particular focus on one-parameter extensions
to the LCDM standard model involving local primordial non-Gaussianity (described by fNL) and massive
neutrinos (described by Mnu). We include all of the relevant physical effects due to these additional
parameters, including the change to the halo mass function and the scale-dependent halo bias induced
by local primordial non-Gaussianity. [...] We compute forecasts for Planck, PIXIE, and a cosmic
variance (CV)-limited experiment, using multifrequency subtraction to remove foregrounds and
implementing two masking criteria based on the ROSAT and eROSITA cluster catalogs to reduce the
significant CV errors at low multipoles. We find that Planck can detect the tSZ power spectrum with
>30-sigma significance, regardless of the masking scenario. However, neither Planck or PIXIE
is likely to provide competitive constraints on fNL from the tSZ power spectrum due to CV noise at
low-ell overwhelming the unique signature of the scale-dependent bias. A future CV-limited experiment
could provide a 3-sigma detection of fNL~37, which is the WMAP9 maximum-likelihood result. The
outlook for neutrino masses is more optimistic: Planck can reach levels comparable to the current
upper bounds ~<0.3 eV with conservative assumptions about the ICM; stronger ICM priors could
allow Planck to provide 1-2-sigma evidence for massive neutrinos from the tSZ power spectrum, depending
on the true value of the sum of the neutrino masses. We also forecast a ~<10% constraint on the outer
slope of the ICM pressure profile using the unmasked Planck tSZ power spectrum.
