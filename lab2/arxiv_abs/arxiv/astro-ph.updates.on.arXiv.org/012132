The role of outflows in the formation of stars and the protostellar disks that generate them is a central
question in astrophysics. Outflows are associated with star formation across the entire stellar
mass spectrum. In this review, we describe the observational, theoretical, and computational
advances on magnetized outflows, and their role in the formation of disks and stars of all masses
in turbulent, magnetized clouds. The ability of torques exerted on disks by magnetized winds to
efficiently extract and transport disk angular momentum was developed in early theoretical models
and confirmed by a variety of numerical simulations. The recent high resolution ALMA observations
of disks and outflows now confirm several key aspects of these ideas, e.g. that jets rotate and originate
from large regions of their underlying disks. New insights on accretion disk physics show that magneto-rotational
instability (MRI) turbulence is strongly damped, leaving magnetized disk winds as the dominant
mechanism for transporting disk angular momentum. This has major consequences for star formation,
as well as planet formation. Outflows also play an important role in feedback processes particularly
in the birth of low mass stars and cluster formation. Despite being almost certainly fundamental
to their production and focusing, magnetic fields in outflows in protostellar systems, and even
in the disks, are notoriously difficult to measure. Most methods are indirect and lack precision,
as for example, when using optical/near-infrared line ratios. Moreover, in those rare cases where
direct measurements are possible - where synchrotron radiation is observed, one has to be very careful
in interpreting derived values. Here we also explore what is known about magnetic fields from observations,
and take a forward look to the time when facilities such as SPIRou and the SKA are in routine operation.
