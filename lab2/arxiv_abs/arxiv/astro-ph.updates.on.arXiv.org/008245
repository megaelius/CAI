Time is arguably the key limiting factor for interstellar exploration. At high speeds, flyby missions
to nearby stars by laser propelled wafersats taking 50-100 years would be feasible. Directed energy
launch systems could accelerate on the other side also crafts weighing several tons to cruising
speeds of the order of 1000\,km/s (c/300). At these speeds, superconducting magnetic sails would
be able to decelerate the craft by transferring kinetic energy to the protons of the interstellar
medium. A tantalizing perspective, which would allow interstellar probes to stop whenever time
is not a limiting factor. Prime candidates are in this respect Genesis probes, that is missions aiming
to offer terrestrial life new evolutionary pathways on potentially habitable but hitherto barren
exoplanets. Genesis missions raise important ethical issues, in particular with regard to planetary
protection. Here we argue that exoplanetary and planetary protection differ qualitatively as
a result of the vastly different cruising times for payload delivering probes, which are of the order
of millennia for interstellar probes, but only of years for solar system bodies. Furthermore we
point out that our galaxy may harbor a large number of habitable exoplanets, M-dwarf planets, which
could be sterile due to the presence of massive primordial oxygen atmospheres. We believe that the
prospect terrestrial life has in our galaxy would shift on a fundamental level in case that the existence
of this type of habitable but sterile oxygen planets will be corroborated by future research. It
may also explain why our sun is not a M dwarf, the most common star type, but a medium-sized G-class
star.
