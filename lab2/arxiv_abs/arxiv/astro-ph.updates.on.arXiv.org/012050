The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will open up the possibility of comprehensively measuring
the emission spectra of rocky exoplanets orbiting M dwarfs to detect and characterize their atmospheres.
In preparation for this opportunity, we present model atmospheres for three M-dwarf planets particularly
amenable to secondary eclipse spectroscopy -- TRAPPIST-1b, GJ 1132b, and LHS 3844b. Using three
limiting cases of candidate atmospheric compositions (pure H2O, pure CO2 and solar abundances)
we calculate temperature-pressure profiles and emission and reflection spectra in radiative-convective
equilibrium, including the effects of a solid surface. We find that the atmospheric radiative transfer
is significantly influenced by the cool M-star irradiation; H2O and CO2 absorption bands in the
near-infrared are strong enough to absorb a sizeable fraction of the incoming stellar light at low
pressures, which leads to temperature inversions in the upper atmosphere. The non-gray band structure
of gaseous opacities in the infrared is hereby an important factor. Opacity windows are muted at
higher atmospheric temperatures, so we expect temperature inversions to be common only for sufficiently
cool planets. We also find that pure CO2 atmospheres exhibit lower overall temperatures and stronger
reflection spectra compared to models of the other two compositions. We estimate that for GJ 1132b
and LHS 3844b we should be able to distinguish between different atmospheric compositions with
JWST. The emission lines from the predicted temperature inversions are currently hard to measure,
but high resolution spectroscopy with future Extremely Large Telescopes may be able to detect them.
