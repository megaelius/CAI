Using data collected by the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we report the detection of intra-cluster light
(ICL) with $\sim300$ galaxy clusters in the redshift range of 0.2 to 0.3. We design methods to mask
detected galaxies and stars in the images and stack the cluster light profiles, while accounting
for several systematic effects (sky subtraction, instrumental Point Spread Function, cluster
selection effects and residual light in the ICL raw detection from background and cluster galaxies).
The methods allow us to acquire high signal-to-noise measurements of ICL and central galaxies (CGs),
which we separate with radial cuts. The ICL appears as faint and diffuse extending to at least 1 Mpc
from the cluster center, reaching a surface brightness level of 30 mag/arcsecond$^{2}$. Despite
its low surface brightness, the diffuse light contained in an annulus 30 kpc to 1 Mpc from the center
of the CGs appears to be $\sim 3$ times as luminous as the CG light within the inner 30 kpc. ICL and the
cluster central galaxy contribute to $44\pm17$\% of the total cluster stellar luminosity within
1 Mpc. The ICL color is overall consistent with that of the cluster red sequence galaxies, but displays
a trend of getting bluer with increasing radius. The ICL demonstrates an interesting self-similarity
feature -- for clusters in different richness ranges, their ICL radial profiles are similar after
scaling with cluster $R_\mathrm{200m}$, and the ICL brightness appears to be a good tracer of the
cluster radial mass distribution. These analyses are based on the DES redMaPPer cluster sample
identified in the first year's observations. We expect to further apply the methods to larger cluster
samples from future DES data, as well as measuring faint diffuse light around a variety of galaxies.
