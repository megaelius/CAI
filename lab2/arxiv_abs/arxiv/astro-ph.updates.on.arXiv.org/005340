Hard X-ray astronomical observatories in orbit suffer from a significant amount of background
due to radioactivation induced by cosmic-ray protons and/or geomagnetically trapped protons.
Within the framework of a full Monte Carlo simulation, we present modeling of in-orbit instrumental
background dominated by radioactivation. To reduce the computation time required by straightforward
simulations of delayed emissions from activated isotopes, we insert a semi-analytical calculation
that converts production probabilities of radioactive isotopes by interaction of the primary
protons into decay rates at measurement time of all secondary isotopes. Therefore, our simulation
method is separated into three steps: (1) simulation of isotope production, (2) semi-analytical
conversion to decay rates, and (3) simulation of decays of the isotopes at measurement time. This
method is verified by a simple setup that has a CdTe semiconductor detector, and shows a 100-fold
improvement in efficiency over the straightforward simulation. The simulation framework was
tested against data measured with a CdTe sensor in the Hard X-ray Imager onboard the Hitomi X-ray
Astronomy Satellite, which was put into a low Earth orbit with an altitude of 570 km and an inclination
of 31 degrees, and thus experienced a large amount of irradiation from geomagnetically trapped
protons during its passages through the South Atlantic Anomaly. The simulation is able to treat
full histories of the proton irradiation and multiple measurement windows. The simulation results
agree very well with the measured data, showing that the measured background is well described by
the combination of proton-induced radioactivation of the CdTe detector itself and thick Bi4Ge3O12
scintillator shields, leakage of cosmic X-ray background and albedo gamma-ray radiation, and
emissions from naturally contaminated isotopes in the detector system.
