The recently claimed discovery of a massive ($M_\mathrm{BH}=68^{+11}_{-13}\,M_\odot$) black
hole in the Galactic solar neighborhood has led to controversial discussions because it severely
challenges our current view of stellar evolution. A crucial aspect for the determination of the
mass of the unseen black hole is the precise nature of its visible companion, the B-type star LS V+22
25. Because stars of different mass can exhibit B-type spectra during the course of their evolution,
it is essential to obtain a comprehensive picture of the star to unravel its nature and, thus, its
mass. To this end, we study the spectral energy distribution of LS V+22 25 and perform a quantitative
spectroscopic analysis that includes the determination of chemical abundances for He, C, N, O,
Ne, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar, and Fe. Our analysis clearly shows that LS V+22 25 is not an ordinary main sequence
B-type star. The derived abundance pattern exhibits heavy imprints of the CNO bi-cycle of hydrogen
burning, that is, He and N are strongly enriched at the expense of C and O. Moreover, the elements Mg,
Al, Si, S, Ar, and Fe are systematically underabundant when compared to normal main-sequence B-type
stars. We suggest that LS V+22 25 is a stripped helium star and discuss two possible formation scenarios.
Combining our photometric and spectroscopic results with the Gaia parallax, we infer a stellar
mass of $1.1\pm0.5\,M_\odot$. Based on the binary system's mass function, this yields a minimum
mass of $2-3\,M_\odot$ for the compact companion, which implies that it may not necessarily be a
black hole but a massive neutron- or main sequence star. The star LS V+22 25 has become famous for possibly
having a very massive black hole companion. However, a closer look reveals that the star itself is
a very intriguing object. Further investigations are necessary for complete characterization
of this object.
