Modern astronomical surveys such as the Large Synoptic Sky Survey (LSST) promise an unprecedented
wealth of discoveries, delivered in the form of ~10 million alerts of time-variable events per night.
Astronomers are faced with the daunting challenge of identifying the most scientifically important
events from this flood of data in order to conduct effective and timely follow-up observations.
Several ongoing observing programs have proven databases to be extremely valuable in conducting
efficient follow-up, particularly when combined with tools to select targets, submit observation
requests directly to ground- and space-based facilities (manual, remotely-operated and robotic),
handle the resulting data, interface with analysis software and share information with collaborators.
We draw on experience from a number of follow-up programs running at LCOGT, all of which have independently
developed systems to provide these capabilities, including the Microlensing Key Project (RoboNet,
PI: Tsapras, Co-I: Street), the Global Supernovae Project (SNEx, PI: Howell), and the Near-Earth
Object Project (NEOExchange, PI: Lister). We refer to these systems in general as Target and Observation
Managers, or TOMs. Future projects, facing a much greater and rapidly-growing list of potential
targets, will find such tools to be indispensable, but the systems developed to date are highly specialized
to the projects they serve and are not designed to scale to the LSST alert rate. We present a project
to develop a general-purpose software toolkit that will enable astronomers to easily build TOM
systems that they can customize to suit their needs, while a professionally-developed codebase
will ensure that the systems are capable of scaling to future programs.
