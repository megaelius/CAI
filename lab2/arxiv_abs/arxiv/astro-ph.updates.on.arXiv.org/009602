The poor stickiness of silicate dust grains is a major obstacle to the formation of rocky planetesimals.
In this study, we examine the possibility that silicate grains with an organic mantle, which we call
Organic-Mantled Grains (OMGs), form planetesimals through direct coagulation. Organic mantles
are commonly found in interplanetary dust particles, and laboratory experiments show that they
are softer than silicates, in particular in warm environments. This, combined with the theory of
particle adhesion, implies that OMGs are stickier than bare silicate grains. Because organic mantles
can survive up to 400 K, silicate grains inside the water snow line in protoplanetary disks can in
principle hold such mantles. We construct a simple grain adhesion model to estimate the threshold
collision velocity below which aggregates of OMGs can grow. The model shows that aggregates of 0.1
\micron-sized OMGs can overcome the fragmentation barrier in protoplanetary disks if the mantles
are as thick as those in interplanetary dust particles and if the temperature is above $\sim$ 200
K. We use this adhesion model to simulate the global evolution of OMG aggregates in the inner part
of a protoplanetary disk, demonstrating that OMG aggregates can indeed grow into planetesimals
under favorable conditions. Because organic matter is unstable at excessively high temperatures,
rocky planetesimal formation by the direct sticking of OMGs is expected to occur in a disk annulus
corresponding to the temperature range $ \sim$ 200--400 K. The organic-rich planetesimals may
grow into carbon-poor rocky planetesimals by accreting a large amount of carbon-poor chondrules.
