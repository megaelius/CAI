We identify subhalos in dark matter only (DMO) zoom-in simulations that are likely to be disrupted
due to baryonic effects by using a random forest classifier trained on two hydrodynamic simulations
of Milky Way-mass host halos from the Latte suite of the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE)
project. We train our classifier using five properties of each disrupted and surviving subhalo:
pericentric distance and scale factor at first pericentric passage after accretion, and scale
factor, virial mass, and maximum circular velocity at accretion. Our five-property classifier
identifies disrupted subhalos in the FIRE simulations with $95\%$ accuracy. We predict surviving
subhalo populations in DMO simulations of the FIRE host halos, finding excellent agreement with
the hydrodynamic results; in particular, our classifier outperforms DMO zoom-in simulations
that include the gravitational potential of the central galactic disk in each hydrodynamic simulation,
indicating that it captures both the dynamical effects of a central disk and additional baryonic
physics. We also predict surviving subhalo populations for a suite of DMO zoom-in simulations of
MW-mass host halos, finding that baryons impact each system consistently and that the predicted
amount of subhalo disruption is larger than the host-to-host scatter among the subhalo populations.
Although the small size and specific baryonic physics prescription of our training set limits the
generality of our results, our work suggests that machine learning classification algorithms
trained on hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations can efficiently predict realistic subhalo populations.
