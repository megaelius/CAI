Minkowski Tensors are tensorial generalizations of the scalar Minkowski Functionals. Due to their
tensorial nature they contain additional morphological information of structures, in particular
about shape and alignment, in comparison to the scalar Minkowski functionals. They have recently
been used [29] to study the statistical isotropy of temperature and E mode data from the Planck satellite.
The calculation in [29] relied on stereographic projection of the fields to extract the shape and
alignment information. In this work, we calculate Minkowski Tensors directly on the sphere and
compute the net alignment in the data, based on a recent work that extends the definition of Minkowski
Tensors to random fields on curved spaces. This method circumvents numerical errors that can be
introduced by the stereographic projection. We compare the resulting net alignment parameter
values obtained from the frequency coadded CMB temperature data cleaned by the SMICA pipeline,
to those obtained from simulations that include instrumental beam effects and residual foreground
and noise. We find very good agreement between the two within $\approx$ 1$\sigma$ . We further compare
the alignments obtained from the beam-convolved CMB maps at individual Planck frequencies to those
in the corresponding simulations. We find no significant difference between observed data and
simulations across all Planck frequencies, except for the 30 GHz channel. For the 30 GHz channel
we find $\approx$ 2$\sigma$ difference between the data and the simulations. This mild disagreement
most likely originates from inaccurate estimation of the instrumental beam at 30 GHz.
