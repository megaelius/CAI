Aims. We used realistic three-dimensional (3D) radiative hydrodynamical (RHD) simulations from
the Stagger-grid and synthetic images computed with the radiative transfer code Optim3D to provide
interferometric observables to extract the signature of stellar granulation and transiting planets.
Methods. We computed intensity maps from RHD simulations for twelve interferometric instruments
covering wavelengths ranging from optical to infrared. The stellar surface asymmetries in the
brightness distribution mostly affect closure phases. We compared the closure phases of the system
star with a transiting planet and the star alone and considered the impact of magnetic spots constructing
a hypothetical starspots image. Results. All the simulations show departure from the axisymmetric
case at all wavelengths. We presented two possible targets (Beta Com and Procyon) and found that
departures up to 16 deg can be detected on the 3rd lobe and higher. In particular, MIRC is the most appropriate
instrument because it combines good UV coverage and long baselines. Moreover, we explored the impact
of convection on interferometric planet signature for three prototypes of planets. It is possible
to disentangle the signature of the planet at particular wavelengths (either in the infrared or
in the optical) by comparing the closure phases of the star at difference phases of the planetary
transit. Conclusions. The detection and characterisation of planets must be based on a comprehensive
knowledge of the host star; this includes the detailed study of the stellar surface convection with
interferometric techniques. In this context, RHD simulations are crucial to reach this aim. We
emphasize that interferometric observations should be pushed at high spatial frequencies by accumulating
observations on closure phases at short and long baselines.
