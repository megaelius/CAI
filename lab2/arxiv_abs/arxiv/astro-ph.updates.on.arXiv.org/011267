The 21cm line probes the evolution of matter perturbations over a wide range of redshifts, from the
dark ages down to the completion of reionization. Observing the 21cm cosmological signal will extend
our understanding of the evolution of the Universe and it is thus important to investigate the predictions
of different cosmological models. In this paper we focus on the prospect of constraining coupled
quintessence models during the Epoch of Reionization both for global signal experiments and for
intensity mapping surveys. To derive the all-sky 21cm signal and fluctuations in coupled quintessence,
we simulate cosmological volumes of the 21cm signal including the coupling between dark matter
and the quintessence field, where the strength of the coupling is labeled by the parameter $Q$. We
show that the coupling between dark matter and quintessence modifies structure formation and expedites
the process of reionization. For the upcoming 21cm line surveys like SKA and a fiducial global 21cm
signal experiment, we perform a Fisher matrix analysis to constrain the coupling $Q$ and the dark
matter density parameter $\Omega_\mathrm{dm}$. The results indicate that SKA will be able to place
a 68% upper limit $0.04$ to $|Q|$. At the same time, such a global 21cm detector provides a constraint
on the dark matter density parameter $\Omega_\mathrm{dm}$ around $\Delta\Omega_{\rm dm}\approx
0.005$, whereas SKA sets a quite weaker constraint around $\Delta\Omega_{\rm dm}\approx0.1$.
These constraints are comparable to those already obtained from the cosmic microwave background,
but explore an entirely different redshift range.
