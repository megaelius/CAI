We present new models for the rotational evolution of solar-like stars between 1 Myr and 10 Gyr with
the aim to reproduce the distributions of rotational periods observed for star forming regions
and young open clusters within this age range. The models include a new wind braking law based on recent
numerical simulations of magnetized stellar winds and specific dynamo and mass-loss prescriptions
are adopted to tie angular momentum loss to angular velocity. The model additionally assume constant
angular velocity during the disk accretion phase and allow for decoupling between the radiative
core and the convective envelope as soon as the former develops. We have developed rotational evolution
models for slow, median and fast rotators with initial periods of 10, 7, and 1.4d, respectively.
The models reproduce reasonably well the rotational behaviour of solar-type stars between 1 Myr
and 4.5 Gyr, including PMS to ZAMS spin up, prompt ZAMS spin down, and the early-MS convergence of
surface rotation rates. We find the model parameters accounting for the slow and median rotators
are very similar to each other, with a disk lifetime of 5 Myr and a core-envelope coupling timescale
of 28-30 Myr. In contrast, fast rotators have both shorter disk lifetime (2.5 Myr) and core-envelope
coupling timescale (12 Myr). We emphasize that these results are highly dependent on the adopted
braking law. We also report a tentative correlation between initial rotational period and disk
lifetime, which suggests that protostellar spin-down by massive disks in the embedded phase is
at the origin of the initial dispersion of rotation rates in young stars. We conclude that this class
of semi-empirical models successfully grasp the main trends of the rotational behaviour of solar-type
stars as they evolve and make specific predictions that may serve as a guide for further development.
