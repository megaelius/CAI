For years, scientists have used data from NASA's Kepler Space Telescope to look for and discover
thousands of transiting exoplanets. In its extended K2 mission, Kepler observed stars in various
regions of sky all across the ecliptic plane, and therefore in different galactic environments.
Astronomers want to learn how the population of exoplanets are different in these different environments.
However, this requires an automatic and unbiased way to identify the exoplanets in these regions
and rule out false positive signals that mimic transiting planet signals. We present a method for
classifying these exoplanet signals using deep learning, a class of machine learning algorithms
that have become popular in fields ranging from medical science to linguistics. We modified a neural
network previously used to identify exoplanets in the Kepler field to be able to identify exoplanets
in different K2 campaigns, which range in galactic environments. We train a convolutional neural
network, called AstroNet-K2, to predict whether a given possible exoplanet signal is really caused
by an exoplanet or a false positive. AstroNet-K2 is highly successful at classifying exoplanets
and false positives, with accuracy of 98% on our test set. It is especially efficient at identifying
and culling false positives, but for now, still needs human supervision to create a complete and
reliable planet candidate sample. We use AstroNet-K2 to identify and validate two previously unknown
exoplanets. Our method is a step towards automatically identifying new exoplanets in K2 data and
learning how exoplanet populations depend on their galactic birthplace.
