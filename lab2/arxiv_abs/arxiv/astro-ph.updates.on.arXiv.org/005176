There is a long history of using optical emission and absorption lines to constrain the metallicity
and ionization parameters of gas in galaxies. However, comparable diagnostics are less well-developed
for the UV. Here,} we assess the diagnostic potential of both absorption and emission features in
the UV and evaluate the diagnostics against observations of local and high redshift galaxies. We
use the {\tt CloudyFSPS} nebular emission model of Byler+2017, extended to include emission predictions
in the UV, to evaluate the metallicity sensitivity of established UV stellar absorption indices,
and to identify those that include a significant contribution from nebular emission. We present
model UV emission line fluxes as a function of metallicity and ionization parameter, assuming both
instantaneous bursts and constant SFRs. We identify combinations of strong emission lines that
constrain metallicity and ionization parameter, including [CIII]$\lambda1907$, CIII]$\lambda1909$,
OIII]$\lambda1661,1666$, SiIII]$\lambda1883,1892$, CIV$\lambda$1548,1551, NII]$\lambda1750,1752$,
and MgII$\lambda2796$, and develop UV versions of the canonical "BPT" diagram. We quantify the
relative contribution from stellar wind emission and nebular line emission to diagnostic line
ratios that include the CIV$\lambda$1548,1551 lines, and also develop an observationally motivated
relationship for N and C enrichment that improves the performance of photoionization models. We
summarize the best diagnostic choices and the associated redshift range for low-, mid-, and high-resolution
rest-UV spectroscopy in preparation for the launch of JWST.
