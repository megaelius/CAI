We present new high resolution and dynamic range dust column density and temperature maps of the
California Molecular Cloud derived from a combination of Planck and Herschel dust-emission maps,
and 2MASS NIR dust-extinction maps. We used these data to determine the ratio of the 2.2 micron extinction
coefficient to the 850 micron opacity and found the value to be close to that found in a similar study
of the Orion B cloud but significantly higher than that characterizing the Orion A and Perseus clouds,
indicating that significant variations in the fundamental optical properties of dust exist between
local clouds. We show that over a wide range of extinction, the column density probability distribution
function (PDF$_N$) of the cloud can be well described by a simple power law with an index that represents
a steeper decline with column density than found in similar studies of the Orion and Perseus clouds.
Using only the protostellar population of the cloud and our extinction maps we investigate the Schmidt
relation within the cloud. We show that the protostellar surface density, $\Sigma_*$, is directly
proportional to the ratio of the protostellar and cloud pdfs. We use the cumulative distribution
of protostars to infer the functional forms for both $\Sigma_*$ and PDF$_*$. We find that $\Sigma_*$
is best described by two power-law functions with steeper indicies than found in other local GMCs.
We find that the protostellar pdf is a declining function of extinction also best described by two
power-laws whose behavior mirrors that of $\Sigma_*$. Our observations suggest that variations
both in the slope of the Schmidt relation and in the sizes of the protostellar populations between
GMCs are largely driven by variations in the slope of the cloud pdf. This confirms earlier studies
suggesting that cloud structure plays a major role in setting the global star formation rates in
GMCs.
