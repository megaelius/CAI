GW170817 showed that neutron star mergers not only emit gravitational waves but also can release
electromagnetic signatures in multiple wavelengths. Within the first half of the third observing
run of the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, there have been a number of gravitational wave candidates
of compact binary systems for which at least one component is potentially a neutron star. In this
article, we look at the candidates S190425z, S190426c, S190510g, S190901ap, and S190910h, predicted
to have potentially a non-zero remnant mass, in more detail. All these triggers have been followed
up with extensive campaigns by the astronomical community doing electromagnetic searches for
their optical counterparts; however, according to the released classification, there is a high
probability that some of these events might not be of extraterrestrial origin. Assuming that the
triggers are caused by a compact binary coalescence and that the individual source locations have
been covered during the EM follow-up campaigns, we employ three different kilonova models and apply
them to derive possible constraints on the matter ejection consistent with the publicly available
gravitational-wave trigger information and the lack of a kilonova detection. These upper bounds
on the ejecta mass can be related to limits on the maximum mass of the binary neutron star candidate
S190425z and to constraints on the mass-ratio, spin, and NS compactness for the potential black
hole-neutron star candidate S190426c. Our results show that deeper electromagnetic observations
for future gravitational wave events near the horizon limit of the advanced detectors are essential.
