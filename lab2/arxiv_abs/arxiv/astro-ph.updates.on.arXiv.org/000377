The large-scale field of the Sun is well represented by its lowest energy (or potential) state. Recent
observations, by comparison, reveal that many solar-type stars show large-scale surface magnetic
fields that are highly non-potential - that is, they have been stressed above their lowest-energy
state. This non-potential component of the surface field is neglected by current stellar wind models.
The aim of this paper is to determine its effect on the coronal structure and wind. We use Zeeman-Doppler
surface magnetograms of two stars - one with an almost potential, one with a non-potential surface
field - to extrapolate a static model of the coronal structure for each star. We find that the stresses
are carried almost exclusively in a band of uni-directional azimuthal field that is confined to
mid-latitudes. Using this static solution as an initial state for an MHD wind model, we then find
that the final state is determined primarily by the potential component of the surface magnetic
field. The band of azimuthal field must be confined close to the stellar surface as it is not compatible
with a steady-state wind. By artificially increasing the stellar rotation rate we demonstrate
that the observed azimuthal fields can not be produced by the action of the wind but must be due to processes
at or below the stellar surface. We conclude that the background winds of solar-like stars are largely
unaffected by these highly-stressed surface fields. Nonetheless, the increased flare activity
and associated coronal mass ejections that may be expected to accompany such highly-stressed fields
may have a significant impact on any surrounding planets.
