We report a $\approx3.6\sigma$ detection of the warm-hot, massive, extended circumgalactic medium
(CGM) around an L$_\star$ starburst spiral galaxy NGC 3221, using deep Suzaku observations. The
temperature of the gas is $\approx 10^{6.1}$ K, comparable to that of the Milky Way CGM. The spatial
extent of the gas is at least $\approx$ 150 kpc. For a $\beta$-model of density profile with solar
abundance, the central emission measure is EM$_o \approx 3\pm 1 \times 10^{-5}$ cm$^{-6}$ kpc and
the central electron density is $n_{eo} \approx 3.8\pm 0.6 \times10^{-4}$ cm$^{-3}$, with a slope
of $\beta \approx 0.56$. We investigate a range of $\beta$ values, and find that the details of the
density profile do not change our results significantly. The mass of the warm-hot gas, assuming
MW-type metallicity of 0.3 Z$_\odot$ is $22\pm 3 \times 10^{10}$M$_\odot$. This is the most massive
baryon component of the galaxy and can account for the missing baryons in NGC 3221. Ours is the first
detection of an extended CGM around an L$_\star$ spiral galaxy, where the baryon fraction $f_b \approx
0.14\pm0.04$ is consistent with the cosmological mean value. We also investigated the missing
metals problem in conjunction with the missing baryons problem and conclude that metals are likely
to be preferentially expelled from the galaxy. We further investigate the thermodynamics of the
hot gaseous halo combining the physical properties of the galactic disk and the CGM. We find that
the CGM can be heated and enriched with metals by the starburst-driven feedback. However, some of
the outflowing gas is likely to leave the galaxy, and some is likely to precipitate back onto the disk,
providing fuel for the next generation of star-formation.
