Ever since the discovery of Cosmic Rays (CRs), significant advancements have been made in modeling
their propagation in the Galaxy and in the Heliosphere. However, propagation models suffer from
degeneracy of many parameters. To complicate the picture the precision of recent data have started
challenging existing models. To tackle these issues we use available multifrequency observations
of the interstellar emission from radio to gamma rays, together with direct CR measurements, to
study local interstellar spectra (LIS) and propagation models. As a result, the electron LIS is
characterized without any assumption on solar modulation, and favorite propagation models are
put forward. More precisely, our analysis leads to the following main conclusions: (1) the electron
injection spectrum needs at least a break below a few GeV; (2) even though consistent with direct
CR measurements, propagation models producing a LIS with large all-electron density from a few
hundreds of MeV to a few GeV are disfavored by both radio and gamma-ray observations; (3) the usual
assumption that direct CR measurements, after accounting for solar modulation, are representative
of the proton LIS in our ~1 kpc region is challenged by the observed local gamma-ray HI emissivity.
We provide the resulting proton LIS, all-electron LIS, and propagation parameters, based on synchrotron,
gamma-ray, and direct CR data. A plain diffusion model and a tentative diffusive-reacceleration
model are put forward. The various models are investigated in the inner-Galaxy region in X-rays
and gamma rays. Predictions of the interstellar emission for future gamma-ray instruments (e-ASTROGAM
and AMEGO) are derived.
