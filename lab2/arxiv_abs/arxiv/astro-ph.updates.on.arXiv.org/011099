The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has obtained multi-epoch observations providing the opportunity
for a comprehensive variability search aiming to uncover new variables. We have therefore undertaken
the task of creating a catalog of variable sources based on version 3 of the Hubble Source Catalog
(HSC), which relies on publicly available images obtained with the WFPC2, ACS, and WFC3 instruments
onboard the HST. We adopted magnitude-dependent thresholding in median absolute deviation (a
robust measure of light curve scatter) combined with sophisticated preprocessing techniques
and visual quality control to identify and validate variable sources observed by Hubble with the
same instrument and filter combination five or more times. The Hubble Catalog of Variables (HCV)
includes 84,428 candidate variable sources (out of 3.7 million HSC sources that were searched for
variability) with $V \leq 27$ mag; for 11,115 of them the variability is detected in more than one
filter. The data points in the light curves of the variables in the HCV catalog range from five to 120
points (typically having less than ten points); the time baseline ranges from under a day to over
15 years; while $\sim$8% of all variables have amplitudes in excess of 1 mag. Visual inspection performed
on a subset of the candidate variables suggests that at least 80% of the candidate variables that
passed our automated quality control are true variable sources rather than spurious detections
resulting from blending, residual cosmic rays, and calibration errors. The HCV is the first, homogeneous
catalog of variable sources created from archival HST data and currently is the deepest catalog
of variables available. The catalog includes variable stars in our Galaxy and nearby galaxies,
as well as transients and variable active galactic nuclei. (abbreviated)
