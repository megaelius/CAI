The ANTARES radiation hydrodynamics code is capable of simulating the solar granulation in detail
unequaled by direct observation. We introduce a state-of-the-art numerical tool to the solar physics
community and demonstrate its applicability to model the solar granulation. The code is based on
the weighted essentially non-oscillatory finite volume method and by its implementation of local
mesh refinement is also capable of simulating turbulent fluids. While the ANTARES code already
provides promising insights into small-scale dynamical processes occurring in the quiet-Sun
photosphere, it will soon be capable of modeling the latter in the scope of radiation magnetohydrodynamics.
In this first preliminary study we focus on the vertical photospheric stratification by examining
a 3-D model photosphere with an evolution time much larger than the dynamical timescales of the solar
granulation and of particular large horizontal extent corresponding to $25\!" \!\! \times \, 25\!"$
on the solar surface to smooth out horizontal spatial inhomogeneities separately for up- and downflows.
The highly resolved Cartesian grid thereby covers $\sim 4~\mathrm{Mm}$ of the upper convection
zone and the adjacent photosphere. Correlation analysis, both local and two-point, provides a
suitable means to probe the photospheric structure and thereby to identify several layers of characteristic
dynamics: The thermal convection zone is found to reach some ten kilometers above the solar surface,
while convectively overshooting gas penetrates even higher into the low photosphere. An $\approx
145\,\mathrm{km}$ wide transition layer separates the convective from the oscillatory layers
in the higher photosphere.
