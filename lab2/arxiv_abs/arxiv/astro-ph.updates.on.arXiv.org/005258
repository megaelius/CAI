Standard present day large-scale structure (LSS) analyses make a major assumption in their Bayesian
parameter inference --- that the likelihood has a Gaussian form. For summary statistics currently
used in LSS, this assumption, even if the underlying density field is Gaussian, cannot be correct
in detail. We investigate the impact of this assumption on two recent LSS analyses: the Beutler et
al. (2017) power spectrum multipole ($P_\ell$) analysis and the Sinha et al. (2017) group multiplicity
function ($\zeta$) analysis. Using non-parametric divergence estimators on mock catalogs originally
constructed for covariance matrix estimation, we identify significant non-Gaussianity in both
the $P_\ell$ and $\zeta$ likelihoods. We then use Gaussian mixture density estimation and Independent
Component Analysis on the same mocks to construct likelihood estimates that approximate the true
likelihood better than the Gaussian $pseudo$-likelihood. Using these likelihood estimates,
we accurately estimate the true posterior probability distribution of the Beutler et al. (2017)
and Sinha et al. (2017) parameters. Likelihood non-Gaussianity shifts the $f\sigma_8$ constraint
by $-0.44\sigma$, but otherwise, does not significantly impact the overall parameter constraints
of Beutler et al. (2017). For the $\zeta$ analysis, using the pseudo-likelihood significantly
underestimates the uncertainties and biases the constraints of Sinha et al. (2017) halo occupation
parameters. For $\log M_1$ and $\alpha$, the posteriors are shifted by $+0.43\sigma$ and $-0.51\sigma$
and broadened by $42\%$ and $66\%$, respectively. The divergence and likelihood estimation methods
we present provide a straightforward framework for quantifying the impact of likelihood non-Gaussianity
and deriving more accurate parameter constraints.
