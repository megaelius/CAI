We present results from an Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Cycle 2 program
to map CO(2-1) emission in nearby early-type galaxies (ETGs) that host circumnuclear gas disks.
We obtained $\sim0.3''-$resolution Band 6 observations of seven ETGs selected on the basis of dust
disks in Hubble Space Telescope images. We detect CO emission in five at high signal-to-noise ratio
with the remaining two only faintly detected. All CO emission is coincident with the dust and is in
dynamically cold rotation. Four ETGs show evidence of rapid central rotation; these are prime candidates
for higher-resolution ALMA observations to measure the black hole masses. In this paper we focus
on the molecular gas and continuum properties. Total gas masses and H$_2$ column densities for our
five CO-bright galaxies are on average $\sim10^8$ $M_\odot$ and $\sim10^{22.5}$ cm$^{-2}$ over
the $\sim$kpc-scale disks, and analysis suggests that these disks are stabilized against gravitational
fragmentation. The continuum emission of all seven galaxies is dominated by a central, unresolved
source, and in five we also detect a spatially extended component. The $\sim$230 GHz nuclear continua
are modeled as power laws ranging from $S_\nu \sim \nu^{-0.4}$ to $\nu^{1.6}$ within the observed
frequency band. The extended continuum profiles of the two radio-bright (and CO-faint) galaxies
are roughly aligned with their radio jet and suggests resolved synchrotron jets. The extended continua
of the CO-bright disks are coincident with optically thick dust absorption and have spectral slopes
that are consistent with thermal dust emission.
