Observations of redshifted HI 21-cm signal appear to be the most promising probe of the cosmic dark
ages. The signal carries information about the thermal state along with density distribution of
the intergalactic medium. The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR), through its interaction
with charged particles, plays a major role in determining the kinetic and spin temperature of neutral
hydrogen (HI) gas in the IGM during dark ages. Spatially fluctuating ionization fraction, which
is caused by inhomogeneous recombinations, causes heat transfer from the CMBR to the IGM gas inhomogeneous.
We revisit impact of this inhomogeneous heat transfer on spatial fluctuations in the observed HI
21-cm signal over a large redshift range during dark ages. Our study shows that the effect negatively
impacts fluctuations in the HI spin temperature and results in enhanced HI 21-cm power spectrum.
We find that the effect is particularly important during the transition of the gas kinetic temperature
being coupled to the CMBR to fully decoupled from it i.e, in the redshift range $30 \lesssim z \lesssim
300$. It is found that, on the average the HI power spectrum $P_{T_b}(k, z)$ is enhanced by $\sim 4\%$,
$\sim10 \%$ , $\sim 20\%$ and $\sim 30 \%$ at redshifts $60$, $90$, $140$ and $200$ respectively at
$k=0.1 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. The effect becomes even more significant at lower values of $k_{\parallel}^2/k^2$
due to reduced dominance of the peculiar velocity. It is observed that the power spectrum is enhanced
by $\sim 49\%$ and $\sim 93\%$ at redshifts $140$ and $200$ respectively at $k=0.1 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$
for $k_{\parallel}^2/k^2=0$ . This enhancement has a weak k-mode dependence.
