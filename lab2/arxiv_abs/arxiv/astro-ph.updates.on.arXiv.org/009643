The rather elusive High-Frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillations(HFQPO) observed in the X-ray
lightcurve of black holes have been seen in a wide range of frequencies, even within one source. It
is also notable to have been detected in "pairs" of HFQPOs with a close to integer ratio between the
frequencies. The aim of this paper is to investigate some of the possible observable that we could
obtain from having the Rossby Wave Instability (RWI) active in the accretion disc surrounding the
compact object. Using the newly developed GR-AMRVAC code able to follow the evolution of the RWI
in a full general relativistic framework, we explore how RWI can reproduce observed HFQPO frequencies
ratios and if it is compatible with the observations. In order to model the emission coming from the
disc we have linked our general relativistic simulations to the general relativistic ray-tracing
GYOTO code and delivered synthetic observables that can be confronted to actual data from binary
systems hosting HFQPOs.}{We have demonstrated in our study that some changes in the physical conditions
prevailing in the part of the disc where RWI can be triggered leads to various dominant RWI modes whose
ratio recovers frequency ratios observed in various X-ray binary systems. In addition, we have
also highlighted that when RWI is triggered near the last stable orbit of a spinning black hole, the
amplitude of the X-ray modulation increases with the spin of the black hole. Revisiting published
data on X-ray binary systems, we show that this type of relationship actually exists in the five systems
where an indirect measure of the spin of the black hole is available.
