We focus on the resolved stellar populations of one early- and four transition-type dwarf galaxies
in the Sculptor group, with the aim to examine the potential presence of population gradients and
place constraints on their mean metallicities. We use deep HST images to construct CMDs, from which
we select stellar populations that trace different evolutionary phases in order to constrain their
range of ages and metallicities, as well as to examine their spatial distribution. In addition,
we use the resolved stars in the RGB in order to derive photometric metallicities. All studied dwarfs
contain intermediate-age stars with ages of ~1Gyr and older as traced by the luminous asymptotic
giant branch and red clump stars, while the transition-type dwarfs contain also stars younger than
~1Gyr as traced by a young main sequence and vertical red clump stars. Moreover, the spatial distribution
of the stars that trace different evolutionary phases shows a population gradient in all transition-type
dwarfs. The derived error-weighted mean metallicities, assuming purely old stellar populations,
range from -1.5dex for ESO294-G010 to -1.9dex for Scl-dE1, and should be considered as lower limits
to their true metallicities. Assuming intermediate-age stellar populations to dominate the dwarfs,
we derive upper limits for the metallicities that are 0.3 to 0.2 dex higher than the metallicities
derived assuming purely old populations. We discuss how photometric metallicity gradients are
affected by the age-metallicity degeneracy, which prevents strong conclusions regarding their
actual presence. Finally, the transition-type dwarfs lie beyond the virial radius of their closest
bright galaxy, as also observed for the LG transition-type dwarfs. Scl-dE1 is the only dSph in our
sample and is an outlier in a potential morphology-distance relation, similar as the two isolated
dSphs of the LG, Tucana and Cetus.
