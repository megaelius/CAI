We present the redshift evolution of the radial surface brightness (SB) profile of the rest-frame
UV and optical stellar continua for 9119 Lya emitters (LAEs) at z~0-8 and 0-2, respectively. Using
the deep extra-galactic legacy data of Hubble Space Telescope and the LAE catalogs taken from the
literature, we derive the structural quantities of the 9119 LAEs and the comparison galaxies of
165517 photo-z star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and 10454 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) by the well-tested
profile fitting. We carefully define the homogeneous sample of LAEs falling in the same ranges of
UV-continuum luminosity and Lya equivalent width over the cosmic time, and evaluate the redshift
evolution. We find that the effective radius r_e distribution is represented by a log-normal function,
and that the median Sersic index is almost constant at n~1-1.5 for the LAEs over z~0-7, suggesting
that typical LAEs have a stellar-disk morphology. The size-luminosity relation of the LAEs monotonically
decreases towards high-z, following the size-luminosity relations of SFGs and LBGs. The median
r_e values of the LAEs significantly evolve as r_e ~ (1+z)^-1.37, similar to those of the SFGs and
LBGs in the same luminosity range, in contrast with the claims of no evolution made by previous studies
whose LAE samples are probably biased to faint sources at low redshift. Interestingly, the r_e distribution,
the star-formation rate surface densities, and the stellar-to-halo size ratios of the LAEs are
comparable with those of the SFGs and LBGs, indicating that LAEs have stellar components similar
to SFGs and LBGs with a Lya emissivity controlled by the non-stellar physics such as geometry, kinematics,
and ionization states of the inter-stellar/circum-galactic medium.
