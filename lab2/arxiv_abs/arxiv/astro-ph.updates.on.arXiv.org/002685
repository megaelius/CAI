We examine the growing class of binary millisecond pulsars known as redbacks. In these systems the
pulsar's companion has a mass between 0.1 and about 0.5 solar masses in an orbital period of less than
1.5 days. All show extended radio eclipses associated with circumbinary material. They do not lie
on the period-companion mass relation expected from the canonical intermediate-mass X-ray binary
evolution in which the companion filled its Roche lobe as a red giant and has now lost its envelope
and cooled as a white dwarf. The redbacks lie closer to, but usually at higher period than, the period-companion
mass relation followed by cataclysmic variables and low-mass X-ray binaries. In order to turn on
as a pulsar mass accretion on to a neutron star must be sufficiently weak, considerably weaker than
expected in systems with low-mass main-sequence companions driven together by magnetic braking
or gravitational radiation. If a neutron star is formed by accretion induced collapse of a white
dwarf as it approaches the Chandrasekhar limit some baryonic mass is abruptly lost to its binding
energy so that its effective gravitational mass falls. We propose that redbacks form when accretion
induced collapse of a white dwarf takes place during cataclysmic variable binary evolution because
the loss of gravitational mass makes the orbit expand suddenly so that the companion no longer fills
its Roche lobe. Once activated, the pulsar can ablate its companion and so further expand the orbit
and also account for the extended eclipses in the radio emission of the pulsar that are characteristic
of these systems. The whole period-companion mass space occupied by the redbacks can be populated
in this way.
