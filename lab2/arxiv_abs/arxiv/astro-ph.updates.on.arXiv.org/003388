Photonic technologies offer numerous advantages for astronomical instruments such as spectrographs
and interferometers owing to their small footprints and diverse range of functionalities. Operating
at the diffraction-limit, it is notoriously difficult to efficiently couple such devices directly
with large telescopes. We demonstrate that with careful control of both the non-ideal pupil geometry
of a telescope and residual wavefront errors, efficient coupling with single-mode devices can
indeed be realised. A fibre injection was built within the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive
Optics (SCExAO) instrument. Light was coupled into a single-mode fibre operating in the near-IR
(J-H bands) which was downstream of the extreme adaptive optics system and the pupil apodising optics.
A coupling efficiency of 86% of the theoretical maximum limit was achieved at 1550 nm for a diffraction-limited
beam in the laboratory, and was linearly correlated with Strehl ratio. The coupling efficiency
was constant to within <30% in the range 1250-1600 nm. Preliminary on-sky data with a Strehl ratio
of 60% in the H-band produced a coupling efficiency into a single-mode fibre of ~50%, consistent
with expectations. The coupling was >40% for 84% of the time and >50% for 41% of the time. The laboratory
results allow us to forecast that extreme adaptive optics levels of correction (Strehl ratio >90%
in H-band) would allow coupling of >67% (of the order of coupling to multimode fibres currently).
For Strehl ratios <20%, few-port photonic lanterns become a superior choice but the signal-to-noise
must be considered. These results illustrate a clear path to efficient on-sky coupling into a single-mode
fibre, which could be used to realise modal-noise-free radial velocity machines, very-long-baseline
optical/near-IR interferometers and/or simply exploit photonic technologies in future instrument
design.
