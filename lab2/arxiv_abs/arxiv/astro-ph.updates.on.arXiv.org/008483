We report new Chandra hard X-ray ($>2\rm~keV$) and JVLA C-band observations of the nuclear superbubble
of NGC 3079, an analog of the "Fermi bubble" in our Milky Way. We detect extended hard X-ray emission
on the SW side of the galactic nucleus with coherent multi-wavelength features in radio, H$\alpha$,
and soft X-ray. The hard X-ray feature has a cone shape with possibly a weak cap, forming a bubble-like
structure with a diameter of $\sim1.1\rm~kpc$. A similar extended feature, however, is not detected
on the NE side, which is brighter in all other wavelengths such as radio, H$\alpha$, and soft X-ray.
Scattered photons from the nuclear region or other nearby point-like X-ray bright sources, inverse
Compton emission from cosmic ray electrons via interaction with the cosmic microwave background,
or any individually faint stellar X-ray source populations, cannot explain the extended hard X-ray
emission on the SW side and the strongly NE/SW asymmetry. A synchrotron emission model, plus a thermal
component accounting for the excess at $\sim1\rm~keV$, can well characterize the broadband radio/hard
X-ray spectra. The broadband synchrotron spectra do not show any significant cutoff, and even possibly
slightly flatten at higher energy. This rules out a loss-limited scenario in the acceleration of
the cosmic ray electrons in or around this superbubble. As the first detection of kpc-scale extended
hard X-ray emission associated with a galactic nuclear superbubble, the spatial and spectral properties
of the multi-wavelength emissions indicate that the cosmic ray leptons responsible for the broad-band
synchrotron emission from the SW bubble must be accelerated in situ, instead of transported from
the nuclear region of the galaxy.
