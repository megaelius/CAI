Understanding the universal accretion history of dark matter halos is the first step towards determining
the origin of their universal structure. In this work, we begin by using the extended Press-Schechter
(EPS) formalism to show that the halo mass accretion history is determined by the growth rate of initial
density perturbations, and that it follows the expression M(z)=M0(1+z)^{af(M0)}e^{-f(M0)z},
where M0=M(z=0), a depends on cosmology and f(M0) depends only on the matter power spectrum. We then
explore the relation between the structure of the inner dark matter halo and halo mass history using
a suite of cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations. We confirm that the formation time, defined
as the time when the virial mass of the main progenitor equals the mass enclosed within the scale radius,
correlates strongly with concentration. We provide a fitting formula for the relation between
concentration and formation time, from which we show analytically that the scatter in formation
time determines the scatter in concentration. Based on our analytic and numerical work, we conclude
that the concentration is determined by the halo mass history, and show by simple modeling that one
can be determined from the other. Since halo concentrations are characterized by their mass histories,
and the latter are described by the initial density perturbations and the growth rate, we have therefore
established the physical link between halo concentrations and the initial density perturbation
field. Finally, we model the halo mass history as M(z)=M0(1+z)^{alpha}e^{beta z} and find a direct
correlation between the parameters alpha, beta and concentration. We provide fitting formulas
for the halo mass history and accretion rate as a function of halo mass, and demonstrate how halo mass
history changes according to the adopted mass definition and cosmology.
