We analyze a [C II] 158 micron map obtained with the L2 GREAT receiver on SOFIA of the emission/reflection
nebula illuminated by the early B star S1 in the rho-OphA cloud core. This data set has been complemented
with maps of CO(3-2), 13CO(3-2) and C18O(3-2), observed as a part of the JCMT Gould Belt Survey, with
archival HCO^+(4-3) JCMT data, as well as with [O I] 63 and 145 micron imaging with Herschel/PACS.
The [C II] emission is completely dominated by the strong PDR emission from the nebula surrounding
S1 expanding into the dense Oph A molecular cloud west and south of S1. The [C II] emission is significantly
blue shifted relative to the CO spectra and also relative to the systemic velocity, particularly
in the northwestern part of the nebula. The [C II] lines are broader towards the center of the S1 nebula
and narrower towards the PDR shell. The [C II] lines are strongly self-absorbed over an extended
region in the S1 PDR. Based on the strength of the [13C II] F = 2-1 hyperfine component, [C II] is significantly
optically thick over most of the nebula. CO and 13CO(3-2) spectra are strongly self-absorbed, while
C18O(3-2) is single peaked and centered in the middle of the self-absorption. We have used a simple
two-layer LTE model to characterize the background and foreground cloud contributing to the [C
II] emission. From this analysis we estimate the extinction due to the foreground cloud to be ~9.9
mag, which is slightly less than the reddening estimated towards S1. Since some of the hot gas in the
PDR is not traced by low J CO emission, this result appears quite plausible. Using a plane parallel
PDR model with the observed [OI(145)]/[C II] brightness ratio and an estimated FUV intensity of
3100-5000 G0 suggests that the density of the [C II] emitting gas is ~3-4x10^3 cm^-3.
