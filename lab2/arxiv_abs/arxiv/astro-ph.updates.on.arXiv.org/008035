The origin of the reservoirs of water on Earth is debated. The Earth's crust may contain at least three
times more water than the oceans. This crust water is found in the form of phyllosilicates, whose
origin probably differs from that of the oceans. We test the possibility to form phyllosilicates
in protoplanetary disks, which can be the building blocks of terrestrial planets. We developed
an exploratory rate-based warm surface chemistry model where water from the gas-phase can chemisorb
on dust grain surfaces and subsequently diffuse into the silicate cores. We apply the phyllosilicate
formation model to a zero-dimensional chemical model and to a 2D protoplanetary disk model (ProDiMo).
The disk model includes in addition to the cold and warm surface chemistry continuum and line radiative
transfer, photoprocesses (photodissociation, photoionization, and photodesorption), gas-phase
cold and warm chemistry including three-body reactions, and detailed thermal balance. Despite
the high energy barrier for water chemisorption on silicate grain surfaces and for diffusion into
the core, the chemisorption sites at the surfaces can be occupied by a hydroxyl bond (-OH) at all gas
and dust temperatures from 80 to 700 K for a gas density of 2E4 cm^-3. The chemisorption sites in the
silicate cores are occupied at temperatures between 250 and 700 K. At higher temperatures thermal
desorption of chemisorbed water occurs. The occupation efficiency is only limited by the maximum
water uptake of the silicate. The timescales for complete hydration are at most 1E5 years for 1 mm
radius grains at a gas density of 1E8 cm^-3. Phyllosilicates can be formed on dust grains at the dust
coagulation stage in protoplanetary disks within 1 Myr. It is however not clear whether the amount
of phyllosilicate formed by warm surface chemistry is sufficient compared to that found in Solar
System objects.
