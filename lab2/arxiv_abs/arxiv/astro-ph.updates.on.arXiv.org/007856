We present a spatially resolved study of the relation between dust and metallicity in the nearby
spiral galaxies M101 (NGC 5457) and NGC 628 (M74). We explore the relation between the chemical abundances
of their gas and stars with their dust content and their chemical evolution. The empirical spatially
resolved oxygen effective yield and the gas to dust mass ratio (GDR) across both disc galaxies are
derived, sampling one dex in oxygen abundance. We find that the metal budget of the NGC 628 disc and
most of the M101 disc appears consistent with the predictions of the simple model of chemical evolution
for an oxygen yield between half and one solar, whereas the outermost region (R<0.8R25) of M101 presents
deviations suggesting the presence of gas flows. The GDR-metallicity relation shows a two slopes
behaviour, with a break at 12+log(O/H)~8.4, a critical metallicity predicted by theoretical dust
models when stardust production equals grain growth. A relation between GDR and the fraction of
molecular to total gas, Sigma(H2)/Sigma(gas) is also found. We suggest an empirical relationship
between GDR and the combination of 12+log(O/H), for metallicity, and Sigma(H2)/Sigma(gas), a
proxy for the molecular clouds fraction. The GDR is closely related with metallicity at low abundance
and with Sigma(H2)/Sigma(gas) for higher metallicities suggesting ISM dust growth. The ratio
Sigma(dust)/Sigma(star) correlates well with 12 + log(O/H) and strongly with log(N/O) in both
galaxies. For abundances below the critical one, the 'stardust' production gives us a constant
value suggesting a stellar dust yield similar to the oxygen yield.
