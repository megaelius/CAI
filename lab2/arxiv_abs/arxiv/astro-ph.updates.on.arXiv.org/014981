We analyze the three-dimensional shapes and kinematics of the young star cluster population forming
in a high-resolution GRIFFIN project simulation of a metal-poor dwarf galaxy starburst. The star
clusters, which follow a power-law mass distribution, form from the cold ISM phase with an IMF sampled
with individual stars down to 4 solar masses at sub-parsec spatial resolution. Massive stars and
their important feedback mechanisms are modelled in detail. The simulated clusters follow a surprisingly
tight relation between the specific angular momentum and mass with indications of two sub-populations.
Massive clusters ($M_\mathrm{cl}\gtrsim 3\times 10^4 M_{\odot})$ have the highest specific
angular momenta at low ellipticities ($\epsilon\sim 0.2$) and show alignment between their shapes
and rotation. Lower mass clusters have lower specific angular momenta with larger scatter, show
a broader range of elongations, and are typically misaligned indicating that they are not shaped
by rotation. The most massive clusters $(M \gtrsim 10^5\,M_{\odot})$ accrete gas and proto-clusters
from a $ \lesssim 100\,\rm pc$ scale local galactic environment on a $t \lesssim 10\,\rm Myr$ timescale,
inheriting the ambient angular momentum properties. Their two-dimensional kinematic maps show
ordered rotation at formation, up to $v \sim 8.5\,\rm km\, s^{-1}$, consistent with observed young
massive clusters and old globular clusters, which they might evolve into. The massive clusters
have angular momentum parameters $\lambda_R\lesssim 0.5$ and show Gauss-Hermite coefficients
$h_3$ that are anti-correlated with the velocity, indicating asymmetric line-of-sight velocity
distributions as a signature of a dissipative formation process.
