We report on a Hubble Space Telescope search for rest-frame ultraviolet emission from the host galaxies
of five far-infrared-luminous $z\simeq{}6$ quasars and the $z=5.85$ hot-dust free quasar SDSS
J0005-0006. We perform 2D surface brightness modeling for each quasar using a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo
estimator, to simultaneously fit and subtract the quasar point source in order to constrain the
underlying host galaxy emission. We measure upper limits for the quasar host galaxies of $m_J>22.7$
mag and $m_H>22.4$ mag, corresponding to stellar masses of $M_\ast<2\times10^{11}M_\odot$.
These stellar mass limits are consistent with the local $M_{\textrm{BH}}$-$M_\ast$ relation.
Our flux limits are consistent with those predicted for the UV stellar populations of $z\simeq6$
host galaxies, but likely in the presence of significant dust ($\langle A_{\mathrm{UV}}\rangle\simeq
2.6$ mag). We also detect a total of up to 9 potential $z\simeq6$ quasar companion galaxies surrounding
five of the six quasars, separated from the quasars by 1.4''-3.2'', or 8.4-19.4 kpc, which may be
interacting with the quasar hosts. These nearby companion galaxies have UV absolute magnitudes
of -22.1 to -19.9 mag, and UV spectral slopes $\beta$ of -2.0 to -0.2, consistent with luminous star-forming
galaxies at $z\simeq6$. These results suggest that the quasars are in dense environments typical
of luminous $z\simeq6$ galaxies. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of these
companions are foreground interlopers. Infrared observations with the James Webb Space Telescope
will be needed to detect the $z\simeq6$ quasar host galaxies and better constrain their stellar
mass and dust content.
