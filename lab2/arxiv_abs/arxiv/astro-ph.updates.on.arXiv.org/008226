Probably, the long-term monitoring of the solar atmosphere started in Italy with the first telescopic
observations of the Sun made by Galileo Galilei in the early $17^{\mathrm{th}}$ century. His recorded
observations and science results, as well as the work carried out by other following outstanding
Italian astronomers inspired the start of institutional programs of regular solar observations
at the Arcetri, Catania, and Rome Observatories. These programs have accumulated daily images
of the solar photosphere and chromosphere taken at various spectral bands over a time span greater
than 80 years. In the last two decades, regular solar observations were continued with digital cameras
only at the Catania and Rome Observatories, which are now part of the INAF National Institute for
Astrophysics. At the two sites, daily solar images are taken at the photospheric G-band, Blue ($\lambda=409.4$
nm), and Red ($\lambda=606.9$ nm) continua spectral ranges and at the chromospheric Ca II K and H$\alpha$
lines, with a $2^{\prime\prime}$ spatial resolution. Solar observation in Italy, which benefits
from over 2500 hours of yearly sunshine, currently aims at the operational monitoring of solar activity
and long-term variability and at the continuation of the historical series as well. Existing instruments
will be soon enriched by the SAMM double channel telescope equipped with magneto-optical filters
that will enable the tomography of the solar atmosphere with simultaneous observations at the K
I 769.9 nm and Na I D 589.0 nm lines. In this contribution, we present the available observations and
outline their scientific relevance.
