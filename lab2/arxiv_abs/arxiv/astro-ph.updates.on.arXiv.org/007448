The relation between radial oxygen abundance distribution (gradient) and other parameters of
a galaxy, such as mass, Hubble type, the presence of a bar, etc., remains unclear despite a large amount
of observational data obtained during the last years. We examine the dependence of the radial oxygen
abundance distribution on the presence of non-axisymmetrical structures (bar/spirals). A sample
of disk galaxies from CALIFA DR3 survey is considered. We adopt the Fourier amplitude A2 of the surface
brightness as a quantitative characteristic of the strength of non-axisymmetric structures in
a galactic disk, in addition to the commonly used morphologic division for A, AB, B types based on
the Hubble classification. To distinguish changes of the local oxygen abundance caused by the non-axisymmetrical
structures, the multi-parametric local mass--metallicity relation is constructed as a function
of parameters such as the bar/spiral pattern strength, the disk size, color index g-r in the SDSS
bands, and central surface brightness of the disk. The gas-phase oxygen abundance gradient is determined
by using the R calibration. We find that there is no significant impact of the non-axisymmetric structures
such as a bar and/or spiral patterns on the local oxygen abundance and radial oxygen abundance gradient
of disk galaxies. Meanwhile, galaxies with higher mass exhibit flatter oxygen abundance gradients.
We show that the oxygen abundance in the central part of the galaxy depends neither on the optical
radius R25 nor the color g-r or the surface brightness of the galaxy. Instead, outside the central
part of the galaxy, the oxygen abundance increases with the g-r value and central surface brightness
of the disk.
