The accretion of pebbles on planetary cores has been widely studied in recent years and is found to
be a highly effective mechanism for planetary growth. While most studies assume planetary cores
as an initial condition in their simulation, the question how, where and when these cores form is
often neglected. We study the impact of pebble accretion during the formation phase and subsequent
evolution of planetary embryos in the early stages of circumstellar disk evolution. In doing so
we aim to quantify the timescales and local dependency of planetary embryo formation, based on the
solid evolution of the disk. We connect a one dimensional two population model for solid evolution
and pebble flux regulated planetesimal formation to the N-body code LIPAD. In our study we focus
on the growth of planetesimals with an initial size of 100 km in diameter by planetesimal collisions
and pebble accretion for the first 1 million years of a viscously evolving disk. We compare 18 different
N-body simulations in which we vary the total planetesimal mass after 1 million years, the surface
density profile of the planetesimal disk, the radial pebble flux and the possibility of pebble accretion.
Pebble accretion leads to the formation of fewer, but substantially more massive embryos. The area
of possible embryo formation is weakly influenced by the accretion of pebbles and the innermost
embryos tend to form slightly earlier compared to the simulations in which pebble accretion is neglected.
Pebble accretion strongly enhances the formation of super earths in the terrestrial planet region,
but it does not enhance the formation of embryos at larger distances.
