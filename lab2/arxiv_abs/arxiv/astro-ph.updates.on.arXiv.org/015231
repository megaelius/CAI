We study the relation between the UV-slope, $\beta$, and the ratio between the infrared- and UV-luminosities
(IRX) of galaxies from TNG50, the latest installment of the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation simulations.
We select 7280 star-forming main-sequence (SFMS) galaxies with stellar mass $10^9M_\odot$ at
redshifts $0 \leq z \leq 4$ and perform radiative transfer with SKIRT to model effects of interstellar
medium dust on the emitted stellar light. Assuming a Milky Way (MW) dust type and a dust-to-metal
ratio of 0.3, we find that TNG50 SFMS galaxies generally agree with observationally-derived IRX-$\beta$
relations at $z \lesssim 1$. However, we find a redshift-dependent systematic offset with respect
to empirically-derived local relations, with the TNG50 IRX-$\beta$ relation shifting towards
lower $\beta$ and steppening at higher redshifts. This is partially driven by variations in the
dust-uncorrected UV-slope of galaxies, due to different star-formation histories of galaxies
selected at different cosmic epochs; we suggest the remainder of the effect is caused by differences
in the effective dust attenuation curves (EDACs) of galaxies as a function of redshift. We find a
typical galaxy-to-galaxy variation of 0.3 dex in IRX at fixed $\beta$, correlated with intrinsic
galaxy properties: galaxies with higher star-formation rates, star-formation efficiencies,
gas metallicities and stellar masses exhibit larger IRX values. We demonstrate a degeneracy between
stellar age, dust geometry and dust composition: $z=4$ galaxies with a Small Magellanic Cloud dust
type follow the same IRX-$\beta$ relation as low-redshift galaxies with MW dust. We provide a redshift-dependent
fitting function for the IRX-$\beta$ relation for MW dust based on our models.
