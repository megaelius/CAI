Non-thermal electron acceleration via magnetic reconnection is thought to play an important role
in powering the variable X-ray emission from radiatively inefficient accretion flows around black
holes. The trans-relativistic regime of magnetic reconnection, where the magnetization $\sigma$,
defined as the ratio of magnetic energy density to enthalpy density, is $\sim 1$, is frequently encountered
in such flows. By means of a large suite of two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate
electron and proton acceleration in the trans-relativistic regime. We focus on the dependence
of the electron energy spectrum on $\sigma$ and the proton $\beta$ (i.e., the ratio of proton thermal
pressure to magnetic pressure). We find that the electron spectrum in the reconnection region is
non-thermal and can be generally modeled as a power law. At $\beta \lesssim 3 \times 10^{-3}$, the
slope, $p$, is independent of $\beta$ and it hardens with increasing $\sigma$ as $p\simeq 1.8 +0.7/\sqrt{\sigma}$.
Electrons are primarily accelerated by the non-ideal electric field at X-points, either in the
initial current layer or in current sheets generated in between merging magnetic islands. At higher
values of $\beta$, the electron power law steepens for all values of $\sigma$. At values of $\beta$
near $\beta_{\rm max}\approx1/4\sigma$, when both electrons and protons are relativistically
hot prior to reconnection, the spectra of both species display an additional component at high energies,
containing a few percent of particles. These particles are accelerated via a Fermi-like process
by bouncing in between the reconnection outflow and a stationary magnetic island. We provide an
empirical prescription for the dependence of the power-law slope and the acceleration efficiency
on $\beta$ and $\sigma$, which can be used in global simulations of collisionless accretion disks.
