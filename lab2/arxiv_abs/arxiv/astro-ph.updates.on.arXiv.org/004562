Some of the heavy elements, such as gold and europium (Eu), are almost exclusively formed by the rapid
neutron capture process (r-process). However, it is still unclear which astrophysical site between
core-collapse supernovae and neutron star - neutron star (NS-NS) mergers produced most of the r-process
elements in the universe. Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models can test these scenarios by
quantifying the frequency and yields required to reproduce the amount of europium (Eu) observed
in galaxies. Although NS-NS mergers have become popular candidates, their required frequency
(or rate) needs to be consistent with that obtained from gravitational wave measurements. Here
we address the first NS-NS merger detected by LIGO/Virgo (GW170817) and its associated Gamma-ray
burst and analyze their implication on the origin of r-process elements. The range of NS-NS merger
rate densities of 320-4740 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ provided by LIGO/Virgo is remarkably consistent
with the range required by GCE to explain the Eu abundances in the Milky Way with NS-NS mergers, assuming
the solar r-process abundance pattern for the ejecta. Under the same assumption, this event has
produced about 1-5 Earth masses of Eu, and 3-13 Earth masses of gold. When using theoretical calculations
to derive Eu yields, constraining the role of NS-NS mergers becomes more challenging because of
nuclear astrophysics uncertainties. This is the first study that directly combines nuclear physics
uncertainties with GCE calculations. If GW170817 is a representative event, NS-NS mergers can
produce Eu in sufficient amounts and are likely to be the main r-process site.
