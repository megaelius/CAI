The magnetic fields of the solar system planets provide valuable insights into the planets' interiors
and can have dramatic consequences for the evolution of their atmospheres and interaction with
the solar wind. However, we have little direct knowledge of magnetic fields in exoplanets. Here
we present a method for detecting magnetic fields in the atmospheres of close-in exoplanets based
on spectropolarimetric transit observations at the wavelength of the helium line at 1083 nm. This
methodology has been successfully applied before for exploring magnetic fields in solar coronal
filaments. Strong absorption signatures (transit depths on the order of a few percent) in the 1083
nm line have recently been observed for several close-in exoplanets. We show that in the conditions
in these escaping atmospheres, metastable helium atoms should be optically pumped by the starlight
and, for field strengths more than a few $\times 10^{-4}$ G, should align with the magnetic field.
This results in linearly polarized absorption at 1083 nm that traces the field direction (the Hanle
effect), which we explore by both analytic computation and with the Hazel numerical code. The linear
polarization $\sqrt{Q^2+U^2}/I$ ranges from $\sim 10^{-3}$ in optimistic cases down to a few $\times
10^{-5}$ for particularly unfavorable cases, with very weak dependence on field strength. The
line-of-sight component of the field results in a slight circular polarization (the Zeeman effect),
also reaching $V/I\sim {\rm few}\times 10^{-5}(B_\parallel/10\,{\rm G})$. We discuss the detectability
of these signals with current (SPIRou) and future (extremely large telescope) high-resolution
infrared spectropolarimeters, and we briefly comment on possible sources of astrophysical contamination.
