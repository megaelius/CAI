We present 3D simulations of core-collapse supernovae from blast-wave initiation by the neutrino-driven
mechanism to shock breakout from the stellar surface, considering two 15 Msun red supergiants (RSG)
and two blue supergiants (BSG) of 15 Msun and 20 Msun. We demonstrate that the metal-rich ejecta in
homologous expansion still carry fingerprints of asymmetries at the beginning of the explosion,
but the final metal distribution is massively affected by the detailed progenitor structure. The
most extended and fastest metal fingers and clumps are correlated with the biggest and fastest-rising
plumes of neutrino-heated matter, because these plumes most effectively seed the growth of Rayleigh-Taylor
(RT) instabilities at the C+O/He and He/H composition-shell interfaces after the passage of the
SN shock. The extent of radial mixing, global asymmetry of the metal-rich ejecta, RT-induced fragmentation
of initial plumes to smaller-scale fingers, and maximal Ni and minimal H velocities do not only depend
on the initial asphericity and explosion energy (which determine the shock and initial Ni velocities)
but also on the density profiles and widths of C+O core and He shell and on the density gradient at the
He/H transition, which lead to unsteady shock propagation and the formation of reverse shocks.
Both RSG explosions retain a great global metal asymmetry with pronounced clumpiness and substructure,
deep penetration of Ni fingers into the H-envelope (with maximum velocities of 4000-5000 km/s for
an explosion energy around 1.5 bethe) and efficient inward H-mixing. While the 15 Msun BSG shares
these properties (maximum Ni speeds up to ~3500 km/s), the 20 Msun BSG develops a much more roundish
geometry without pronounced metal fingers (maximum Ni velocities only ~2200 km/s) because of reverse-shock
deceleration and insufficient time for strong RT growth and fragmentation at the He/H interface.
