The empirical HOD model of Wang et al. 2006 fits, by construction, both the stellar mass function
and correlation function of galaxies in the local Universe. In contrast, the semi-analytical models
of De Lucia & Blazoit 2007 (DLB07) and Guo et al. 2011 (Guo11), built on the same dark matter halo
merger trees than the empirical model, still have difficulties in reproducing these observational
data simultaneously. We compare the relations between the stellar mass of galaxies and their host
halo mass in the three models, and find that they are different. When the relations are rescaled to
have the same median values and the same scatter as in Wang et al., the rescaled DLB07 model can fit
both the measured galaxy stellar mass function and the correlation function measured in different
galaxy stellar mass bins. In contrast, the rescaled Guo11 model still over-predicts the clustering
of low-mass galaxies. This indicates that the detail of how galaxies populate the scatter in the
stellar mass -- halo mass relation does play an important role in determining the correlation functions
of galaxies. While the stellar mass of galaxies in the Wang et al. model depends only on halo mass and
is randomly distributed within the scatter, galaxy stellar mass depends also on the halo formation
time in semi-analytical models. At fixed value of infall mass, galaxies that lie above the median
stellar mass -- halo mass relation reside in haloes that formed earlier, while galaxies that lie
below the median relation reside in haloes that formed later. This effect is much stronger in Guo11
than in DLB07, which explains the over-clustering of low mass galaxies in Guo11. Our results illustrate
that the assumption of random scatter in the relation between stellar and halo mass as employed by
current HOD and abundance matching models may be problematic in case a significant assembly bias
exists in the real Universe.
