Context. Future weak lensing surveys, such as the Euclid mission, will attempt to measure the shapes
of billions of galaxies in order to derive cosmological information. These surveys will attain
very low levels of statistical error, and systematic errors must be extremely well controlled.
In particular, the point spread function (PSF) must be estimated using stars in the field, and recovered
with high accuracy. Aims. The aims of this paper are twofold. Firstly, we took steps toward a nonparametric
method to address the issue of recovering the PSF field, namely that of finding the correct PSF at
the position of any galaxy in the field, applicable to Euclid. Our approach relies solely on the data,
as opposed to parametric methods that make use of our knowledge of the instrument. Secondly, we studied
the impact of imperfect PSF models on the shape measurement of galaxies themselves, and whether
common assumptions about this impact hold true in an Euclid scenario. Methods. We extended the recently
proposed resolved components analysis approach, which performs super-resolution on a field of
under-sampled observations of a spatially varying, image-valued function. We added a spatial
interpolation component to the method, making it a true 2-dimensional PSF model. We compared our
approach to PSFEx, then quantified the impact of PSF recovery errors on galaxy shape measurements
through image simulations. Results. Our approach yields an improvement over PSFEx in terms of the
PSF model and on observed galaxy shape errors, though it is at present far from reaching the required
Euclid accuracy. We also find that the usual formalism used for the propagation of PSF model errors
to weak lensing quantities no longer holds in the case of an Euclid-like PSF. In particular, different
shape measurement approaches can react differently to the same PSF modeling errors.
