The association of the high-energy neutrino event IceCube-170922A with the flaring blazar TXS~0506+056
indicates that hadronic processes may operate in a blazar jet. We perform semi-analytical spectral
fitting of the multi-wavelength emission to obtain estimates of the jet physical parameters, and
find that the multi-wavelength emission can be explained by either a proton synchrotron scenario
or an electron inverse Compton scattering scenario. In the proton synchrotron scenario, a strong
magnetic field of $10-100$~G is required, implying that the particle acceleration is likely driven
by magnetic energy dissipation such as magnetic reconnection events. The inverse Compton scenario
implies a magnetic field of $0.1-1$~G. Thus the particle acceleration is likely driven by the kinetic
energy dissipation such as shocks. We also discuss the neutrino production in the context of single-zone
and multi-zone models based on the above two scenarios. We demonstrate that the variability and
optical polarization signatures can be used to distinguish the two scenarios due to their drastically
different magnetic field. Specifically, the proton synchrotron scenario may show orphan fast
variability in the low-energy spectral component on top of the active state, with an optical polarization
degree $\lesssim 10\%$ throughout the active state. The inverse Compton scattering scenario instead
predicts co-variability of the low- and high-energy components on both short and long time scales,
as well as a strongly variable optical polarization degree that can reach $\gtrsim 20\%$. Our results
suggest that optical polarization measurements and well-resolved multi-wavelength light curves
can be used to understand the electromagnetic and high-energy neutrino emissions by TXS~0506+056
and similar events in the future.
