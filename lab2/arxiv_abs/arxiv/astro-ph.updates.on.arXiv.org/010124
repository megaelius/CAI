The regimes of possible global atmospheric circulation patterns in an Earth-like atmosphere are
explored using a simplified GCM based on the University of Hamburg's Portable University Model
for the Atmosphere with simplified (linear) boundary layer friction, a Newtonian cooling scheme
and dry convective adjustment. A series of controlled experiments are conducted by varying planetary
rotation rate and imposed equator-to-pole temperature difference. These defining parameters
are cast into dimensionless forms to establish a parameter space, in which different circulation
regimes are mapped and classified. Clear trends are found when varying planetary rotation rate
and frictional and thermal relaxation timescales. The sequence of circulation regimes as a function
of planetary rotation rate strongly resembles that obtained in laboratory experiments on rotating,
stratified flows, especially if a topographic $\beta$-effect is included in those experiments
to emulate the planetary vorticity gradients induced by the spherical curvature of the planet.
A regular baroclinic wave regime is also obtained at intermediate values of thermal Rossby number
and its characteristics and dominant zonal wavenumber depend strongly on the strength of radiative
and frictional damping. These regular waves exhibit some strong similarities to baroclinic storms
observed on Mars under some conditions. Multiple jets are found at the highest rotation rates, when
the Rossby deformation radius and other eddy-related length scales are much smaller than the radius
of the planet. These exhibit some similarity to the multiple zonal jets observed on gas giant planets.
Jets form on a scale comparable to the most energetic eddies and the Rhines scale poleward of the supercritical
latitude. The balance of heat transport varies strongly with {\Omega}* between eddies and zonally
symmetric flows, becoming weak with fast rotation.
