Context: Since circumstellar dust in debris disks is short-lived, dust-replenishing requires
the presence of a reservoir of planetesimals. These planetesimals in the parent belt of debris disks
orbit their host star and continuously supply the disk with fine dust through their mutual collisions.
Aims: We aim to understand effects of different collisional parameters on the observational appearance
of eccentric debris disks. Methods: The collisional evolution of selected debris disk configurations
was simulated with the numerical code ACE. Subsequently, selected observable quantities are simulated
with our newly developed code DMS. The impact of the eccentricity, dynamical excitation, and the
material strength is discussed with respect to the grain size distribution, the spectral energy
distribution, and spatially resolved images of debris disk systems. Results: The most recognizable
features in different collisional evolutions are as follows. First, both the increase of dynamical
excitation in the eccentric belt of the debris disk system and the decrease of the material strength
of dust particles result in a higher production rate of smaller particles. This reduces the surface
brightness differences between the periastron and the apastron sides of the disks. For very low
material strengths, the "pericenter glow" phenomenon is reduced and eventually even replaced
by the opposite effect, the "apocenter glow". Second, it is possible to constrain the level of collisional
activity from the appearance of the disk, for example, the wavelength-dependent apocenter-to-pericenter
flux ratio. Within the considered parameter space, the impact of the material strength on the appearance
of the disk is stronger than that of dynamical excitation of the system. Finally, we find that the
impact of the collisional parameters on the net spectral energy distribution is weak.
