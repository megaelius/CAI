Recent developments of transition-edge sensors (TESs), based on extensive experience in ground-based
experiments, have been making the sensor techniques mature enough for their application on future
satellite CMB polarization experiments. LiteBIRD is in the most advanced phase among such future
satellites, targeting its launch in Japanese Fiscal Year 2027 (2027FY) with JAXA's H3 rocket. It
will accommodate more than 4000 TESs in focal planes of reflective low-frequency and refractive
medium-and-high-frequency telescopes in order to detect a signature imprinted on the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) by the primordial gravitational waves predicted in cosmic inflation. The total
wide frequency coverage between 34GHz and 448GHz enables us to extract such weak spiral polarization
patterns through the precise subtraction of our Galaxy's foreground emission by using spectral
differences among CMB and foreground signals. Telescopes are cooled down to 5Kelvin for suppressing
thermal noise and contain polarization modulators with transmissive half-wave plates at individual
apertures for separating sky polarization signals from artificial polarization and for mitigating
from instrumental 1/f noise. Passive cooling by using V-grooves supports active cooling with mechanical
coolers as well as adiabatic demagnetization refrigerators. Sky observations from the second
Sun-Earth Lagrangian point, L2, are planned for three years. An international collaboration between
Japan, USA, Canada, and Europe is sharing various roles. In May 2019, the Institute of Space and Astronautical
Science (ISAS), JAXA selected LiteBIRD as the strategic large mission No. 2.
