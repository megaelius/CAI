Since the first detection in 2015, ten black hole binary merger events have been formally reported.
These gravitational wave signals have significantly enhanced our understanding of the black hole
astrophysics. In general, the properties of a black hole are comprehensively described by its mass,
spin, and charge. The third parameter is often ignored because of the very low value expected in the
realistic astrophysical environment. In this work, we constrain the amount of charge in a way which
is equivalent to the parametrized post-Einsteinian framework by treating the charge as a small
perturbation with Bayesian method, and we find that the current limit on the charge is similar to
the one obtained by the Fisher information matrix method in previous works. Then we develop a zeroth
order post-Newtonian waveform for charged binary black hole inspirals, and apply this charged
waveform to the binary black hole merger events observed by LIGO-Virgo in their first two runs. A
Bayesian model selection is performed among the post-Newtonian waveform, charged post-Newtonian
waveform, and full inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform. Remarkably, we show that charged post-Newtonian
waveform matches the LIGO-Virgo data better compared with non-charged post-Newtonian waveform,
mainly due to the influence in the late inspiral period, and the full inspiral-merger-ringdown
outrun both by far. The inclusion of charge in the waveform might shift the estimated parameters
significantly. Finally, we obtain certain constraints on the binary black hole charges and discuss
the drawbacks. Our work calls for the development of a full inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform
for charged binary black hole merger, so that more meaningful constraints could be obtained.
