The Fornax Deep Survey (FDS), an imaging survey in the u', g', r', and i'-bands, has a supreme resolution
and image depth compared to the previous spatially complete Fornax Cluster Catalog (FCC). Our new
data allows us to study the galaxies down to r'-band magnitude m$_{r'}\approx$21 mag (M$_{r'}\approx$-10.5
mag). These data provide an important legacy dataset to study the Fornax cluster. We aim to present
the Fornax Deep Survey (FDS) dwarf galaxy catalog, focusing on explaining the data reduction and
calibrations, assessing the quality of the data, and describing the methods used for defining the
cluster memberships for the catalog objects. As a first step we used the SExtractor fine-tuned for
dwarf galaxy detection, to find galaxies from the FDS data, covering a 26 deg$^2$ area of the main
cluster, and the area around the Fornax A substructure. We made 2D-decompositions of the identified
galaxies using GALFIT. We used color-magnitude, luminosity-radius and luminosity-concentration
relations to separate the cluster galaxies from the background galaxies. We then divided the cluster
galaxies into early- and late-type galaxies according to their morphology and gave first order
morphological classifications. Our final catalog includes 14,095 galaxies. We classify 590 galaxies
as being likely Fornax cluster galaxies, of which 564 are dwarfs (M$_{r'}$ > -18.5 mag) consisting
our Fornax dwarf catalog. Of the cluster dwarfs we classify 470 as early-types, and 94 as late-type
galaxies. Our final catalog reaches its 50% completeness limit at magnitude M$_{r'}$ = -10.5 mag
and surface brightness $\bar{\mu}_{e,r'}$ = 26 mag arcsec-2, which is approximately three magnitudes
deeper than the FCC. Based on previous works and comparison with a spectroscopically confirmed
subsample, we estimate that our final Fornax dwarf galaxy catalog has < 10% contamination from the
background objects.
