We have investigated the TUKH122 prestellar core in the Orion A cloud using ALMA 3 mm dust continuum,
N$_2$H$^+$ ($J=1-0$), and CH$_3$OH ($J_K=2_K-1_K$) molecular line observations. Previous studies
showed that TUKH122 is likely on the verge of star formation because the turbulence is almost dissipated
and chemically evolved among other starless cores in the Orion A cloud. By combining ALMA 12-m and
ACA data, we recover extended emission with a resolution of $\sim5"$ corresponding to 0.01 pc and
identify 6 condensations with a mass range of $0.1-0.4$ $M_\odot$ and a radius of $\lesssim0.01$
pc. These condensations are gravitationally bound following a virial analysis and are embedded
in the filament including the elongated core with a mass of $\sim29$ $M_\odot$ and a radial density
profile of $r^{-1.6}$ derived by {\it Herschel}. The separation of these condensations is $\sim0.035$
pc, consistent with the thermal jeans length at a density of $4.4\times10^5$ cm$^{-3}$. This density
is similar to the central part of the core. We also find a tendency that the N$_2$H$^+$ molecule seems
to deplete at the dust peak condensation. This condensation may be beginning to collapse because
the linewidth becomes broader. Therefore, the fragmentation still occurs in the prestellar core
by thermal Jeans instability and multiple stars are formed within the TUKH122 prestellar core.
The CH$_3$OH emission shows a large shell-like distribution and surrounds these condensations,
suggesting that the CH$_3$OH molecule formed on dust grains is released into gas phase by non-thermal
desorption such as photoevaporation caused by cosmic-ray induced UV radiation.
