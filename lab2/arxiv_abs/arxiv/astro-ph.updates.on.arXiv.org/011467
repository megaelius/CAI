We report on the discovery of eight repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources found using the Canadian
Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope. These sources span a dispersion measure
(DM) range of 103.5 to 1281 pc cm$^{-3}$. They display varying degrees of activity: six sources were
detected twice, another three times, and one ten times. These eight repeating FRBs likely represent
the bright and/or high-rate end of a distribution of infrequently repeating sources. For all sources,
we determine sky coordinates with uncertainties of $\sim$10$^\prime$. FRB 180916.J0158+65 has
a burst-averaged DM = $349.2 \pm 0.3$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and a low DM excess over the modelled Galactic maximum
(as low as $\sim$20 pc cm$^{-3}$); this source also has a Faraday rotation measure (RM) of $-114.6
\pm 0.6$ rad m$^{-2}$, much lower than the RM measured for FRB 121102. FRB 181030.J1054+73 has the
lowest DM for a repeater, $103.5 \pm 0.3$ pc cm$^{-3}$, with a DM excess of $\sim$ 70 pc cm$^{-3}$.
Both sources are interesting targets for multi-wavelength follow-up due to their apparent proximity.
The DM distribution of our repeater sample is statistically indistinguishable from that of the
first 12 CHIME/FRB sources that have not repeated. We find, with 4$\sigma$ significance, that repeater
bursts are generally wider than those of CHIME/FRB bursts that have not repeated, suggesting different
emission mechanisms. Our repeater events show complex morphologies that are reminiscent of the
first two discovered repeating FRBs. The repetitive behavior of these sources will enable interferometric
localizations and subsequent host galaxy identifications.
