Stars form through the gravitational collapse of molecular cloud cores. Before collapsing, the
cores are supported by thermal pressure and turbulent motions. A question of critical importance
for the understanding of star formation is how to observationally discern whether a core has already
initiated gravitational collapse or is still in hydrostatic balance. The canonical method to identify
gravitational collapse is based on the observed density radial profile, which would change from
a Bonnor-Ebert type toward power laws as the core collapses. In practice, due to the projection effect,
the resolution limit, and other caveats, it has been difficult to directly reveal the dynamical
status of cores, particularly in massive star-forming regions. We here propose a novel, straight-forward
diagnostic, namely, the collapsing index (CI), which can be modeled and calculated based on the
radial profile of the line width of dense gas. A meaningful measurement of CI requires spatially
and spectrally resolved images of optically thin and chemically stable dense gas tracers. ALMA
observations are making such data sets increasingly available for massive star-forming regions.
Applying our method to one of the deepest dense-gas spectral images ever taken toward such a region,
namely, the Orion molecular cloud, we detect the dynamical status of selected cores therein. We
observationally distinguished a collapsing core in a massive star-forming region from a hydrostatical
one. Our approach would help significantly improve our understanding of the interaction between
gravity and turbulence within molecular cloud cores in the process of star formation.
