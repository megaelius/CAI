We present observations of near-infrared 2.12 micro-meter molecular hydrogen outflows emerging
from 1.1 mm dust continuum clumps in the North America and Pelican Nebula (NAP) complex selected
from the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS). Hundreds of individual shocks powered by over 50
outflows from young stars are identified, indicating that the dusty molecular clumps surrounding
the NGC 7000 / IC 5070 / W80 HII region are among the most active sites of on-going star formation in
the Solar vicinity. A spectacular X-shaped outflow, MHO 3400, emerges from a young star system embedded
in a dense clump more than a parsec from the ionization front associated with the Pelican Nebula (IC
5070). Suspected to be a binary, the source drives a pair of outflows with orientations differing
by 80 degrees. Each flow exhibits S-shaped symmetry and multiple shocks indicating a pulsed and
precessing jet. The `Gulf of Mexico' located south of the North America Nebula (NGC 7000), contains
a dense cluster of molecular hydrogen objects (MHOs), Herbig-Haro (HH) objects, and over 300 YSOs,
indicating a recent burst of star formation. The largest outflow detected thus far in the North America
and Pelican Nebula complex, the 1.6 parsec long MHO 3417 flow, emerges from a 500 Solar mass BGPS clump
and may be powered by a forming massive star. Several prominent outflows such as MHO 3427 appear to
be powered by highly embedded YSOs only visible at a wavelength > 70 micro-meters. An `activity
index' formed by dividing the number of shocks by the mass of the cloud containing their source stars
is used to estimate the relative evolutionary states of Bolocam clumps. Outflows can be used as indicators
of the evolutionary state of clumps detected in mm and sub-mm dust continuum surveys.
