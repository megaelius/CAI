A millimeter-wave survey over half the sky, that spans frequencies in the range of 30 to 350 GHz, and
that is both an order of magnitude deeper and of higher-resolution than currently funded surveys
would yield an enormous gain in understanding of both fundamental physics and astrophysics. By
providing such a deep, high-resolution millimeter-wave survey (about 0.5 uK-arcmin noise and
15 arcsecond resolution at 150 GHz), CMB-HD will enable major advances. It will allow 1) the use of
gravitational lensing of the primordial microwave background to map the distribution of matter
on small scales (k~10/hMpc), which probes dark matter particle properties. It will also allow 2)
measurements of the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects on small scales to map the gas
density and gas pressure profiles of halos over a wide field, which probes galaxy evolution and cluster
astrophysics. In addition, CMB-HD would allow us to cross critical thresholds in fundamental physics:
3) ruling out or detecting any new, light (< 0.1eV), thermal particles, which could potentially
be the dark matter, and 4) testing a wide class of multi-field models that could explain an epoch of
inflation in the early Universe. Such a survey would also 5) monitor the transient sky by mapping
the full observing region every few days, which opens a new window on gamma-ray bursts, novae, fast
radio bursts, and variable active galactic nuclei. Moreover, CMB-HD would 6) provide a census of
planets, dwarf planets, and asteroids in the outer Solar System, and 7) enable the detection of exo-Oort
clouds around other solar systems, shedding light on planet formation. CMB-HD will deliver this
survey in 5 years of observing half the sky, using two new 30-meter-class off-axis cross-Dragone
telescopes to be located at Cerro Toco in the Atacama Desert. The telescopes will field about 2.4
million detectors (600,000 pixels) in total.
