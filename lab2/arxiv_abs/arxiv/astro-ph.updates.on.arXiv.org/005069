To understand and compare the 3D atmospheric structure of HD 209458 b and HD 189733 b, focusing on
the formation and distribution of cloud particles, as well as their feedback on the dynamics and
thermal profile. We couple the 3D Met Office Unified Model (UM), including detailed treatments
of atmospheric radiative transfer and dynamics, to a kinetic cloud formation scheme. The resulting
model self--consistently solves for the formation of condensation seeds, surface growth and evaporation,
gravitational settling and advection, cloud radiative feedback via absorption and, crucially,
scattering. Fluxes directly obtained from the UM are used to produce synthetic SEDs and phase curves.
Our simulations show extensive cloud formation in both planets, however, cooler temperatures
in the HD 189733 b result in higher cloud particle number densities. Sub-micron particles are suspended
by vertical flows leading to extensive upper-atmosphere cloud cover. A combination of meridional
advection and efficient cloud formation in cooler high latitude regions, result in enhanced cloud
coverage for latitudes > 30 degrees and leads to a zonally banded structure for all our simulations.
The cloud bands extend around the entire planet(s), as the temperatures, even on the day side, remain
below the condensation temperature of silicates and oxides. Therefore, our simulated optical
phase curve for HD 209458 b shows no `offset', in contrast to observations. Efficient scattering
by cloud results an atmospheric cooling of up to 250K, and an advection-driven fluctuating cloud
opacity causes temporal variability in the thermal emission. The inclusion of this fundamental
cloud-atmosphere radiative feedback leads to significant differences with approaches neglecting
these physical elements and suggests both a note of caution of interpretations neglecting such
cloud feedback and scattering, and merits further study.
