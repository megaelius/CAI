We want to study how the velocity segregation and the radial profile of the velocity dispersion depend
on the prominence of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). We divide a sample of 102 clusters and
groups of galaxies into four bins of magnitude gap between the two brightest cluster members. We
then compute the velocity segregation in bins of absolute and relative magnitudes. Moreover, for
each bin of magnitude gap we compute the radial profile of the velocity dispersion. When using absolute
magnitudes, the segregation in velocity is limited to the two brightest bins and no significant
difference is found for different magnitude gaps. However, when we use relative magnitudes, a trend
appears in the brightest bin: the larger the magnitude gap, the larger the velocity segregation.
We also show that this trend is mainly due to the presence, in the brightest bin, of satellite galaxies
in systems with small magnitude gaps: in fact, if we study separately central galaxies and satellites,
this trend is mitigated and central galaxies are more segregated than satellites for any magnitude
gap. A similar result is found in the radial velocity dispersion profiles: a trend is visible in central
regions (where the BCGs dominate) but, if we analyse the profile using satellites alone, the trend
disappears. In the latter case, the shape of the velocity dispersion profile in the centre of systems
with different magnitude gaps show three types of behaviours: systems with the smallest magnitude
gaps have an almost flat profile from the centre to the external regions; systems with the largest
magnitude gaps show a monothonical growth from the low values of the central part to the flat ones
in the external regions; finally, systems with $1.0 < \Delta m_{12} \le 1.5$ show a profile that peaks
in the centres and then decreases towards the external regions. We suggest that two mechanisms could
be respons....
