The all-sky Milky Way Star Clusters (MWSC) survey provides uniform and precise ages and other parameters
for a variety of clusters in the Solar Neighbourhood. We construct the cluster age distribution,
investigate its spatial variations, and discuss constraints on cluster formation scenarios of
the Galactic disk during the last 5 Gyrs. Due to the spatial extent of the MWSC, we consider spatial
variations of the age distribution along galactocentric radius $R_G$, and along $Z$-axis. For
the analysis of the age distribution we use 2242 clusters, which all lie within roughly 2.5 kpc of
the Sun. To connect the observed age distribution to the cluster formation history we build an analytical
model based on simple assumptions on the cluster initial mass function and on the cluster mass-lifetime
relation, fit it to the observations, and determine the parameters of the cluster formation law.
Comparison with the literature shows that earlier results strongly underestimated the number
of evolved clusters with ages $t\gtrsim 100$ Myr. Recent studies based on all-sky catalogues agree
better with our data, but still lack the oldest clusters with ages $t\gtrsim 1$ Gyr. We do not observe
a strong variation in the age distribution along $R_G$, though we find an enhanced fraction of older
clusters ($t>1$ Gyr) in the inner disk. In contrast, the distribution strongly varies along $Z$.
The high altitude distribution practically does not contain clusters with $t<1$ Gyr. With simple
assumptions on the cluster formation history, cluster initial mass function and cluster lifetime
we can reproduce the observations. Cluster formation rate and cluster lifetime are strongly degenerate,
which does not allow us to disentangle different formation scenarios. In all cases the cluster formation
rate is strongly declining with time, and the cluster initial mass function is very shallow at the
high mass end. (abridged)
