We present a Bayesian method to identify multiple (chemodynamic) stellar populations in dwarf
spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) using velocity, metallicity, and positional stellar data without
the assumption of spherical symmetry, building on the work of Walker and Pe{\~n}arrubia (2011).
We apply this method to a new Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic survey of the Ursa Minor (UMi) dSph. We identify
892 likely members, making this the largest UMi sample with line-of-sight velocity and metallicity
measurements. Our Bayesian method detects two distinct chemodynamic populations with high significance
($\ln{B}\sim32$). The metal-rich ($[{\rm Fe/H}]=-2.05_{-0.03}^{+0.03}$) population is kinematically
colder ($\sigma_v=4.7_{-1.1}^{+0.8}km/s$) and more centrally concentrated than the metal-poor
($[{\rm Fe/H}]=-2.27_{-0.06}^{+0.05}$) and kinematically hotter population ($\sigma_v =11.4_{-0.7}^{+0.9}km/s$).
Furthermore, we apply the same analysis to the independent MMT/Hectochelle data set with 413 members
from Spencer et al. (2018) and confirm the existence of two chemodynamic populations in UMi. In both
data sets, the metal-rich population is significantly flattened ($\epsilon=0.74\pm0.04$) and
the metal-poor population is closer to spherical ($\epsilon=0.33_{-0.11}^{+0.09}$). Despite
the presence of two populations, we are unable to robustly estimate the slope of the dynamical mass
profile. We found hints for prolate rotation of order $\sim 2 km/s$ in the MMT data set, but further
observations are required to verify this. The flattened metal-rich population invalidates assumptions
built into simple dynamical mass estimators, so we computed new astrophysical dark matter annihilation
(J) and decay profiles based on the rounder, hotter metal-poor population and inferred $\log{J}\sim19.1$
for the Keck data set. Our results paint a more complex picture of the evolution of Ursa Minor than
previously discussed.
