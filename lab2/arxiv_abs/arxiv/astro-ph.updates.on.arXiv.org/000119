(Abridged) We report on our discovery and multi-wavelength follow-up observations of the Pan-STARRS1
supernova (SN) PS1-12sk, a transient with uncommon circumstellar properties that indicate atypical
star formation in its host galaxy cluster or pose a challenge to popular progenitor system models
for this class of explosion. The optical spectra of PS1-12sk are dominated by intermediate-width
He I emission at z = 0.054, reminiscent of the spectra of the archetypal Type Ibn SN 2006jc. Dense Pan-STARRS1
multi-band photometry provides the best constraints to date for the rise time of a SN Ibn and a peak
magnitude of M_z = -18.9 mag. SN Ibn spectroscopic properties are commonly interpreted as the signature
of a massive star (17 - 100 M_solar) explosion within a He-enriched circumstellar medium. However,
unlike previous Type Ibn supernovae, PS1-12sk is associated with a galaxy cluster. The elliptical
brightest cluster galaxy is the most likely host galaxy. We find no evidence for star formation at
the explosion site to sensitive limits (< 0.002 M_solar/yr/kpc^2). We consider two progenitor
system scenarios for PS1-12sk: a massive star explosion or a white dwarf binary system. If PS1-12sk
represents the explosions of a massive star then it serves as direct evidence of vigorous star formation
within the galaxy cluster, associated with a cooling flow or a tidally-stripped dwarf galaxy. The
probability of this is low given the infrequency of core-collapse SNe in red sequence galaxies compounded
by the low volumetric rate of SN Ibn. Progenitor models involving a white dwarf explosion and He-rich
environment are challenged by the high mass loss rate of material ejected 2-5 years prior to the event.
PS1-12sk represents either a statistically unlikely discovery, evidence for a top-heavy IMF in
galaxy cluster cooling flows, or the first clue suggesting an alternate progenitor channel for
Type Ibn SNe.
