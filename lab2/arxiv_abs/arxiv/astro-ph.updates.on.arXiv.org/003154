The current generation of Cherenkov telescopes, together with Fermi-LAT, have greatly increased
our knowledge of $\gamma$-ray blazars. Among them, the high-frequency-peaked BL Lacertae object
(HBL) PKS1424+240 (z $\simeq$ 0.6) is the farthest persistent emitter of very-high-energy (VHE;
E $\geq$ 100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray photons. Current emission models can satisfactorily reproduce
typical blazar emission assuming that the dominant emission process is synchrotron-self-Compton
(SSC) in HBLs; and external-inverse-Compton (EIC) in LBLs and FSRQs. Hadronic models are also able
to correctly reproduce the $\gamma$-ray emission from blazars, although they are in general disfavoured
for bright quasars and rapid flares.The blazar PKS1424+240 is a rare example of a luminous HBL, and
we aim to determine which is the emission process most likely responsible for its $\gamma$-ray emission.
This will impact more generally our comprehension of blazar emission models, and how they are related
to the luminosity of the source and the peak frequency. We investigate different blazar emission
models applied to the SED of PKS1424+240. Among leptonic models, we study a 1-zone SSC model, a 2-zone
SSC model, and an EIC model. We then investigate a blazar hadronic model, and finally a scenario in
which the $\gamma$-ray emission is associated with cascades in the line-of-sight produced by cosmic
rays from the source. After a systematic study of the parameter space of the one-zone SSC model, we
conclude that this scenario is not compatible with $\gamma$-ray observations of PKS1424+240.
A two-zone SSC scenario can alleviate this issue, as well as an EIC solution. For the latter, the external
photon field is assumed to be the infra-red radiation from the dusty torus. Alternatively, hadronic
models can satisfactorily reproduce the $\gamma$-ray emission from PKS1424+240, both as in-source
emission and as cascade emission.
