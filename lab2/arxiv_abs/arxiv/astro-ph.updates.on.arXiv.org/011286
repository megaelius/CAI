The morphology of HII regions around young star clusters provides insight into the timescales and
physical processes that clear a cluster's natal gas. We study ~700 young clusters (<10Myr) in three
nearby spiral galaxies (NGC 7793, NGC 4395, and NGC 1313) using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging
from LEGUS (Legacy ExtraGalactic Ultraviolet Survey). Clusters are classified by their H$\alpha$
morphology (concentrated, partially exposed, no-emission) and whether they have neighboring
clusters (which could affect the clearing timescales). Through visual inspection of the HST images,
and analysis of ages, reddenings, and stellar masses from spectral energy distributions fitting,
together with the (U-B), (V-I) colors, we find: 1) the median ages indicate a progression from concentrated
(~3 Myr), to partially exposed (~4 Myr), to no H$\alpha$ emission (>5Myr), consistent with the expected
temporal evolution of HII regions and previous results. However, 2) similarities in the age distributions
for clusters with concentrated and partially exposed H$\alpha$ morphologies imply a short timescale
for gas clearing (<1Myr). 3) our cluster sample's median mass is ~1000 M, and a significant fraction
(~20%) contain one or more bright red sources (presumably supergiants), which can mimic reddening
effects. Finally, 4) the median E(B-V) values for clusters with concentrated H$\alpha$ and those
without H$\alpha$ emission appear to be more similar than expected (~0.18 vs. ~0.14, respectively),
but when accounting for stochastic effects, clusters without H$\alpha$ emission are less reddened.
To mitigate stochastic effects, we experiment with synthesizing more massive clusters by stacking
fluxes of clusters within each H$\alpha$ morphological class. Composite isolated clusters also
reveal a color and age progression for H$\alpha$ morphological classes, consistent with analysis
of the individual clusters.
