The linear point (LP), defined as the mid-point between the dip and the peak of the two-point clustering
correlation function (TPCF), has been shown to be an excellent standard ruler for cosmology. In
fact, it is nearly redshift-independent, being weakly sensitive to non-linearities, scale-dependent
halo bias and redshift-space distortions. So far, these findings were tested assuming that neutrinos
are massless; in this paper we extend the analysis to massive-neutrino cosmologies. In particular,
we examine if the scale-dependent growth induced by neutrinos affects the LP position and if it is
possible to detect the neutrino masses using the shift of the LP compared to the massless-neutrino
case. For our purposes, we employ two sets of state-of-the-art $N$-body simulations with massive
neutrinos. For each of them we measure the TPCF of cold dark matter (CDM) and halos and, to estimate
the LP, fit the TPCF with a model-independent parametric fit in the range of scales of the Baryon Acoustic
Oscillations (BAO). Overall, we find that the LP retains its features as a standard ruler even when
neutrinos are massive. The cosmic distances measured with the LP can therefore be employed to constrain
the neutrino mass. In addition, we propose a procedure to constrain the neutrino masses by comparing
the measured LP of data to the LP of a mock galaxy catalog with massless neutrinos and fixed cosmological
parameters. The small uncertainty of the LP, $\sigma_\mathrm{LP}$, plays a key role in forecasting
a possible detection of neutrino masses in future surveys. We find that the sum of the neutrino masses
could be detected if several redshift bins are used, provided the survey volume is sufficiently
large and the shot-noise of the galaxy sample is sufficiently low.
