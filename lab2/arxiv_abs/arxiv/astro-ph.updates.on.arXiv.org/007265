We analyze the state of gas embedded in different parts of the Cosmic Web using the IllustrisTNG simulations.
We focus on the mass and volume fractions of baryons in different phases in knots, filaments, sheets
and voids in the Cosmic Web from redshift $z=8$ to redshift $z=0$. We characterise the density-temperature
distribution of different phases and inspect their metallicity, finding evidence for early metal
enrichment in the Intracluster Medium (ICM) of clusters already at $z=4$. Not only we find that filaments
host more star-forming gas than knots, but that filaments also have a higher relative mass fraction
of gas in this phase than knots. In agreement with previous predictions, we show that the cool, diffuse
Intergalactic Medium (IGM; $T<10^5 \, {\rm K}$, $ n_{\rm H}<10^{-4} \, {\rm cm^{-3}}$) and the Warm-Hot
Intergalactic Medium (WHIM; $ 10^5 \, {\rm K} <T<10^7 \, {\rm K}$, $ n_{\rm H} <10^{-4} \, {\rm cm^{-3}}$)
constitute $\sim 38\%$ and $\sim 47\%$ of the baryons at redshift $z=0$, respectively. Our results
indicate that the WHIM can indeed constitute the largest reservoir of {\it missing} baryons at redshift
$z=0$. Using our Cosmic Web classification, we predict the WHIM to be the dominant baryon mass contribution
in filaments and knots at redshift $z=0$, but not in sheets and voids where the cool, diffuse IGM dominates.
We also characterise the evolution of WHIM and IGM from redshift $z=4$ to redshift $z=0$, and find
that the mass fraction of WHIM in filaments and knots evolves only by a factor $\sim 2$ from redshift
$z=0$ to $z=1$, but declines faster at higher redshift. The WHIM only occupies $5-13\%$ of the volume
at redshift $0\leq z \leq 1$. We predict the existence of a significant number of currently undetected
OVII and NeIX absorption systems in cosmic filaments which could be detected by future X-ray telescopes
like ATHENA.
