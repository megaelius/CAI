A large star-to-star variation in the abundances of r-process elements, as seen in the [Eu/Fe] ratio
for Galactic halo stars, is a prominent feature that is distinguishable from other heavy elements.
It is, in part, caused by the presence of highly r-process enriched stars, classified as r-II stars
([Eu/Fe]>+1). In parallel, halo stars show that the ratio of a light r-process element (Y) to Eu is
tightly correlated with [Eu/Fe], giving the lowest [Y/Eu] ratio that levels off at r-II stars. On
the other hand, recent hydrodynamical simulations of coalescing double neutron stars (cNSNSs)
have suggested that r-process sites may be separated into two classes providing different electron-fraction
distributions: tidally-driven dynamical ejecta and (dynamical or postmerger) non-tidal ejecta.
Here, we show that a widely spanning feature of [Eu/Fe] can be reproduced by models that consider
the different masses of tidally-driven dynamical ejecta from both cNSNSs and coalescing black
hole/neutron star binaries (cBHNSs). In addition, the observed [Y/Eu] trend is explained by the
combined nucleosynthesis in two kinds of ejecta with varying mass asymmetry in double NS systems.
Our scenario suggests that massive tidally-driven dynamical ejecta accompanied by massive non-tidal
part from cNSNSs or cBHNSs could alone accommodate r-II abundances, including an actinide boost
in some cases. The event rate for cNSNSs estimated from our study agrees with the latest result of
~1000 (90% confidence interval of 110-3840) Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ by gravitational-wave detection,
and a few events per Gpc$^3$ per year of cBHNSs associated with r-process production are predicted
to emerge.
