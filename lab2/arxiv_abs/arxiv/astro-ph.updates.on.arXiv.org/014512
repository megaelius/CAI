The consistency conditions for asymptotically safe quantum field theories require the existence
of scaling solutions for functions of fields. They extend the renormalizability conditions for
a finite number of couplings in asymptotically free theories. We investigate the shape of the effective
potential for scalar fields at and near the ultraviolet fixed point of asymptotically safe quantum
gravity. We find constant scaling solutions with a completely flat potential and vanishing gauge
and Yukawa couplings. More general scaling potentials do not have a polynomial form. Often they
are characterized by a crossover between two constants for small and large fields. Nonvanishing
gauge couplings can induce spontaneous symmetry breaking due to a potential minimum at nonzero
field values. In contrast, Yukawa couplings to fermions tend to stabilize a minimum at zero field
values. A nonminimal coupling between the scalar field and gravity is associated to a field-dependent
effective Planck mass. It can induce spontaneous symmetry breaking. In general, nonzero gauge,
Yukawa or nonminimal couplings prevent the scaling potential to be completely flat. We discuss
scaling solutions with a constant effective potential for large fields and a non-zero nonminimal
scalar coupling to gravity. They solve the cosmological constant problem asymptotically for the
large field values that are reached for large cosmic times. For the pure standard model coupled to
quantum gravity it seems unlikely that Higgs inflation is compatible with asymptotic safety. We
discuss small modifications of the asymptotic safety prediction for the ratio of top quark and Higgs
boson mass due to nonzero gauge, Yukawa and non-minimal couplings.
