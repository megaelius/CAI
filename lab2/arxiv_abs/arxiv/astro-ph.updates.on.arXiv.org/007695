Changes in solar irradiance and in its spectral distribution are among the main natural drivers
of the climate on Earth. However, irradiance measurements are only available for less than four
decades, while assessment of solar influence on Earth requires much longer records. The aim of this
work is to provide the most up-to-date physics-based reconstruction of the solar total and spectral
irradiance (TSI/SSI) over the last nine millennia. The concentrations of the cosmogenic isotopes
14C and 10Be in natural archives have been converted to decadally averaged sunspot numbers through
a chain of physics-based models. TSI and SSI are reconstructed with an updated SATIRE model. Reconstructions
are carried out for each isotope record separately, as well as for their composite. We present the
first ever SSI reconstruction over the last 9000 years from the individual 14C and 10Be records as
well as from their newest composite. The reconstruction employs physics-based models to describe
the involved processes at each step of the procedure. Irradiance reconstructions based on two different
cosmogenic isotope records, those of 14C and 10Be, agree well with each other in their long-term
trends despite their different geochemical paths in the atmosphere of Earth. Over the last 9000
years, the reconstructed secular variability in TSI is of the order of 0.11%, or 1.5 W/m2. After the
Maunder minimum, the reconstruction from the cosmogenic isotopes is consistent with that from
the direct sunspot number observation. Furthermore, over the nineteenth century, the agreement
of irradiance reconstructions using isotope records with the reconstruction from the sunspot
number by Chatzistergos et al. (2017) is better than that with the reconstruction from the WDC-SILSO
series (Clette et al. 2014), with a lower chi-square-value.
