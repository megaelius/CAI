We present photometry and spectroscopy of the Type IIn supernova (SN) 2011ht, identified previously
as a SN impostor. The light curve exhibits an abrupt transition from a well-defined ~120 day plateau
to a steep bolometric decline. Leading up to peak brightness, a hot emission-line spectrum exhibits
signs of interaction with circumstellar material (CSM), in the form of relatively narrow P-Cygni
features of H I and He I superimposed on broad Lorentzian wings. For the remainder of the plateau phase
the spectrum exhibits strengthening P-Cygni profiles of Fe II, Ca II, and H-alpha. By day 147, after
the plateau has ended, the SN entered the nebular phase, heralded by the appearance of forbidden
transitions of [O I], [O II], and [Ca II] over a weak continuum. At this stage, the light curve exhibits
a low luminosity that is comparable to that sub-luminous Type II-P supernovae, and a relatively
fast visual-wavelength decline that is significantly steeper than the Co-56 decay rate. However,
the total bolometric decline, including the IR luminosity, is consistent with Co-56 decay, and
implies a low Ni-56 mass of ~0.01 M(Sun). We therefore characterize SN 2011ht as a bona-fide core-collapse
SN very similar to the peculiar SNe IIn 1994W and 2009kn. These three SNe define a subclass, which
are Type IIn based on their spectrum, but that also exhibit well-defined plateaus and produce low
Ni-56 yields. We therefore suggest Type IIn-P as a name for this subclass. Possible progenitors
of SNe IIn-P, consistent with the available data, include 8-10 M(Sun) stars, which undergo core
collapse as a result of electron capture after a brief phase of enhanced mass loss, or more massive
M>25 M(Sun) progenitors, which experience substantial fallback of the metal-rich radioactive
ejecta. In either case, the energy radiated by these three SNe during their plateau must be dominated
by CSM interaction (abridged).
