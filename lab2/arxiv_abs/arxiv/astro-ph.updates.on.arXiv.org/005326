A new estimation of the total number and energy of non-thermal electrons produced in the giant (>X17)
solar flare on 2003 October 28 is presented based on the analysis of observations of hard X-ray (HXR)
emission by the High Energy Neutron Detector (HEND) onboard the Mars Odyssey spacecraft orbiting
Mars. This is done to complement the estimation of non-thermal electron energy based on the RHESSI
data, which missed the peak of the flare impulsive phase. We used different models to make this estimation,
including the widespread thick and warm target models. We found that, depending on the model used
and the low-energy cutoff ($E_c$) of non-thermal electrons, the estimate of their total energy
in the entire flare can vary from $1.6 \times 10^{32}$ to $5.7 \times 10^{33}$ ergs. The lowest estimate,
$1.6 \times 10^{32}$ ergs, obtained within the thick target model and fixed $E_c=46$ keV, is consistent
(within the factor of 2) with the estimate based on RHESSI data ($E>5.6 \times 10^{31}$ ergs). In
this case, non-thermal electrons accelerated in the peak of the flare impulsive phase missed by
RHESSI contained approximately 40% of the total energy of non-thermal electrons of the entire flare.
The highest value, $5.7 \times 10^{33}$ ergs, obtained with the thick target model and fixed $E_c=10$
keV, which is comparable to the estimate for another giant flare on 2003 November 4, looks abnormally
high, since it exceeds the total non-potential magnetic energy of the parent active region ($2.9
\times 10^{33}$ ergs). Our estimates also show that the total number and energetics of the HXR-producing
electrons in the flare region is a few times larger than that of the population of energetic electrons
impulsively injected into the interplanetary space from the Sun.
