It has been unambiguously shown in both individual systems and at the population level that hot Jupiters
experience tidal inspiral before the end of their host stars' main sequence lifetimes. Ultra-short-period
(USP) planets have orbital periods $P < 1$ day, rocky compositions, and are expected to experience
tidal decay on similar timescales to hot Jupiters if the efficiency of tidal dissipation inside
their host stars parameterized as $Q_\ast'$ is independent of $P$ and/or secondary mass $M_{\mathrm{p}}$.
Any difference between the two classes of systems would reveal that a constant $Q_\ast'$ model is
insufficient. If USP planets experience tidal inspiral, then USP planet systems will be relatively
young compared to similar stars without USP planets. Because it is a proxy for relative age, we calculate
the Galactic velocity dispersions of USP planet candidate host and non-host stars using data from
Gaia Data Release 2 supplemented with ground-based radial velocities. We find that main sequence
USP planet candidate host stars have kinematics consistent with similar stars in the Kepler field
without observed USP planets. This indicates that USP planet hosts have similar ages as field stars
and that USP planets do not experience tidal inspiral during the main sequence lifetimes of their
host stars. The survival of USP planets requires that $Q_\ast'\gtrsim10^7$ at $P\approx0.7$ day
and $M_{\mathrm{p}}\approx2.6~M_{\odot}$. This result demands that $Q_\ast'$ depend on the
orbital period and/or mass of the secondary in the range $0.5\mathrm{~days}\lesssim P\lesssim5$
days and $1~M_{\oplus}\lesssim M_{\mathrm{p}}\lesssim1000~M_{\oplus}$.
