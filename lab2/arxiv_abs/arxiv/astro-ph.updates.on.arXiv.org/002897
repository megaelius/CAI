The interstellar delivery of carbon atoms locked into molecules might be one of the key ingredients
for the emergence of life. Cyanopolyynes are carbon chains delimited at their two extremities by
an atom of hydrogen and a cyano group, so that they might be excellent reservoirs of carbon. The simplest
member, HC3N, is ubiquitous in the galactic interstellar medium and found also in external galaxies.
Thus, understanding the growth of cyanopolyynes in regions forming stars similar to our Sun, and
what affects it, is particularly relevant. In the framework of the IRAM/NOEMA Large Program SOLIS
(Seeds Of Life In Space), we have obtained a map of two cyanopolyynes, HC3N and HC5N, in the protocluster
OMC2-FIR4. Because our Sun is thought to be born in a rich cluster, OMC2-FIR4 is one of the closest
and best known representatives of the environment in which the Sun may have been born. We find a HC3N/HC5N
abundance ratio across the source in the range ~ 1 - 30, with the smallest values (< 10) in FIR5 and in
the Eastern region of FIR4. The ratios < 10 can be reproduced by chemical models only if: (1) the cosmic-ray
ionisation rate $\zeta$ is ~ $4 \times 10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$; (2) the gaseous elemental ratio C/O is
close to unity; (3) O and C are largely depleted. The large $\zeta$ is comparable to that measured
in FIR4 by previous works and was interpreted as due to a flux of energetic (> 10 MeV) particles from
embedded sources. We suggest that these sources could lie East of FIR4 and FIR5. A temperature gradient
across FIR4, with T decreasing by about 10 K, could also explain the observed change in the HC3N/HC5N
line ratio, without the need of a cosmic ray ionisation rate gradient. However, even in this case,
a high constant cosmic-ray ionisation rate (of the order of $10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$) is necessary to
reproduce the observations.
