To enlarge the sample of known low-surface brightness (LSB) galaxies and to try to provide clues
about their nature, we report the detection of eight of this type of objects ($\mu_{{eff}, g'} \simeq
27$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$) towards the group of galaxies Pegasus I. They are located in the very center
of Pegasus I, close to the dominant elliptical galaxies NGC7619 and NGC7626. Assuming that these
galaxies are at the distance of Pegasus I, we have found that their sizes are intermediate among similar
objects reported in the literature. In particular, we found that three of these galaxies can be classified
as ultra-diffuse galaxies and a fourth one displays a nucleus. The eight new LSB galaxies show a significant
color dispersion around the extrapolation towards faint luminosities of the color-magnitude
relation defined by typical early-type galaxies. In addition, they display values of the S\'ersic
index below 1, in agreement with values obtained for LSB galaxies in other environments. We also
show that there seems to be a bias effect in the size distributions of the detected LSBs in different
environments, in the sense that more distant groups/clusters lack small $r_{eff}$ objects, while
large systems are not found in the Local Group and nearby environments. While there may be an actual
shortage of large LSB galaxies in low-density environments like the Local Group, the non-detection
of small (and faint) systems at large distances is clearly a selection effect. As an example, LSB
galaxies with similar sizes to those of the satellites of Andromeda in the Local Group, will be certainly
missed in a visual identification at the distance of Pegasus I.
