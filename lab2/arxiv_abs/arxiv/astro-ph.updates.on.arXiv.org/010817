Forthcoming surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and Euclid necessitate
automatic and efficient identification methods of strong lensing systems. We present a strong
lensing identification approach that utilizes a feature extraction method from computer vision,
the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), to capture edge patterns of arcs. We train a supervised
classifier model on the HOG of mock strong galaxy-galaxy lens images similar to observations from
the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and LSST. We assess model performance with the area under the curve
(AUC) of a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Models trained on 10,000 lens and non-lens
containing images images exhibit an AUC of 0.975 for an HST-like sample, 0.625 for one exposure of
LSST, and 0.809 for 10-year mock LSST observations. Performance appears to continually improve
with the training set size. Models trained on fewer images perform better in absence of the lens galaxy
light. However, with larger training data sets, information from the lens galaxy actually improves
model performance, indicating that HOG captures much of the morphological complexity of the arc
finding problem. We test our classifier on data from the Sloan Lens ACS Survey and find that small
scale image features reduces the efficiency of our trained model. However, these preliminary tests
indicate that some parameterizations of HOG can compensate for differences between observed mock
data. One example best-case parameterization results in an AUC of 0.6 in the F814 filter image with
other parameterization results equivalent to random performance.
