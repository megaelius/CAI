(Abridged) This paper presents an absorption-line study of the multiphase circumgalactic medium
(CGM) based on observations of a suite of absorption features including Lya, CII, CIV, SiII, SiIII,
and SiIV transitions. Cross-matching between public galaxy and QSO survey data has yielded 111
independent galaxy and QSO pairs for which high-quality archival UV spectra of the QSOs and multi-wavelength
observations of the galaxies are available. The galaxy sample is characterized by a median redshift
of <z> = 0.0232, a median projected distance of <d> = 342 kpc, and a median stellar mass
of log (Mstar/Msun) = 9.04\pm 0.93. It is therefore dominated by low-mass dwarf galaxies. Comparing
the absorber features identified in the QSO spectra with galaxy properties has led to strong constraints
for the CGM at z<~0.06. While abundant hydrogen gas is found beyond the dark matter halo radius
Rh and all through d~500 kpc with a mean covering fraction of ~50%, no heavy elements are detected
at d>~0.5 Rh. The lack of heavy elements at large distances is unlikely due to ionization effects,
since it persists through all ionization states included in the study. Considering all galaxies
at d>Rh leads to a strict upper limit for the covering fraction of heavy elements of ~4% (at a 95%
confidence level) over d=(1-10) Rh. At d<0.5 Rh, differential covering fraction between low-
and high-ionization gas is observed, suggesting that the CGM becomes progressively more ionized
from d<0.2 Rh to larger distances. Comparing absorption-line observations of the CGM at low
and high redshifts shows that massive starburst galaxies at z=2.2 exhibit significantly stronger
mean absorption than dwarf galaxies at z~0 and the distinction is most pronounced in low-ionization
species traced by CII and SiII absorption lines, suggesting distinct ionization conditions between
the CGM at low and high redshifts.
