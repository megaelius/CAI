Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious millisecond-duration radio transients observed from
extragalactic distances. Magnetars have been long speculated as the possible engine to power repeating
bursts from FRB sources, but no convincing evidence has been collected so far. Recently, a Galactic
magnetar dubbed Soft Gamma-ray Repeater (SGR) J1935+2154 entered an active phase by emitting intense
soft gamma-ray bursts. One fast radio burst with two peaks (hereafter FRB 200428) and a luminosity
comparable to those of extragalactic FRBs was detected from the source in association with a soft
$\gamma$-ray / hard X-ray flare. Here we report an eight-hour targeted observational campaign
with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) in four observing sessions,
assisted by multi-wavelength (optical and hard X-rays) observations. During the third session,
twenty-nine SGR bursts were detected by the {\it Fermi} Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). Throughout
the observing period, especially during the scrutinized epochs when SGR bursts reached the Earth,
no single dispersed pulsed emission was detected by FAST. This places a fluence upper limit eight
orders of magnitude deeper than the fluence of FRB 200428. Our results suggest that FRB -- SGR burst
associations are rather rare. FRBs may be highly relativistic and geometrically beamed or may carry
narrow spectra with the characteristic frequencies of the most bursts far outside the FAST band.
More intriguingly, it is also possible that the physical condition to achieve coherent radiation
in SGR bursts is contrived. Only under extreme conditions could an FRB be made in association with
an SGR burst.
