The relic density of symmetric and asymmetric dark matter in a Gauss-Bonnet (GB) modified Randall-Sundrum
(RS) type II braneworld cosmology is investigated. The existing study of symmetric dark matter
in a GB braneworld (Okada and Okada, 2009) found that the expansion rate was reduced compared to that
in standard General Relativity (GR), thereby delaying particle freeze-out and resulting in relic
abundances which are suppressed by up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$. This is in direct contrast to
the behaviour observed in RS braneworlds where the expansion rate is enhanced and the final relic
abundance boosted. However, this finding that relic abundances are suppressed in a GB braneworld
is based upon a highly contrived situation in which the GB era evolves directly into a standard GR
era, rather than passing through a RS era as is the general situation. This collapse of the RS era requires
equating the mass scale $m_{\alpha}$ of the GB modification and the mass scale $m_{\sigma}$ of the
brane tension, scales that would naturally be expected to be vastly different ($m_{\alpha} \gg
m_{\sigma}$). We investigate the effect upon the relic abundance of choosing more realistic values
for the ratio $\mathcal{R}_{m} \equiv m_{\alpha}/m_{\sigma}$ and find that the relic abundance
can be either enhanced or suppressed by more than two orders of magnitude. However, suppression
only occurs for a small range of parameter choices and, overwhelmingly, the predominant situation
is that of enhancement as we recover the usual Randall-Sundrum type behaviour in the limit $\mathcal{R}_m
\gg 1$. We use the latest observational bound $\Omega_{DM}h^2 = 0.1187 \pm 0.0017$ to constrain
the various model parameters and briefly discuss the implications for direct/indirect dark matter
detection experiments as well as dark matter particle models.
