The radial drift and diffusion of dust particles in protoplanetary disks affect both the opacity
and temperature of such disks as well as the location and timing of planetesimal formation. In this
paper, we present results of numerical simulations of particle-gas dynamics in protoplanetary
disks that include dust grains with various size distributions. We consider three scenarios in
terms of particle size ranges, one where the Stokes number $\tau_{\rm{s}} = 10^{-1} - 10^0$, one
where $\tau_{\rm{s}} = 10^{-4} - 10^{-1}$ and finally one where $\tau_{\rm{s}} = 10^{-3} - 10^{0}$.
Moreover, we consider both discrete and continuous distributions in particle size. In accordance
with previous works we find in our multi-species simulations that different particle sizes interact
via the gas and as a result their dynamics changes compared to the single-species case. The larger
species trigger the streaming instability and create turbulence that drives the diffusion of the
solid materials. We measure the radial equilibrium velocity of the system and find that the radial
drift velocity of the large particles is reduced in the multi-species simulations and that the small
particle species move on average outwards. We also vary the steepness of the size distribution,
such that the exponent of the solid number density distribution, $\rm{d}\it{N}/\rm{d}\it{a}
\propto \it{a^{-q}}$, is either $q = 3$ or $q = 4$. We measure the scale height of the particles and
observe that small grains are stirred up well above the sedimented midplane layer where the large
particles reside. Our measured diffusion and drift parameters can be used in coagulation models
for planet formation as well as to understand relative mixing of the components of primitive meteorites
(matrix, chondrules and CAIs) prior to inclusion in their parent bodies.
