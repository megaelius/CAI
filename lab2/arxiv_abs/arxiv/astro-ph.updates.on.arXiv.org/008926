Analyzing a sample of 84 early-type galaxies with directly-measured super-massive black hole
masses---nearly doubling the sample size of such galaxies with multi-component decompositions---a
symmetric linear regression on the reduced (merger-free) sample of 76 galaxies reveals $M_{BH}\propto
M_{*,sph}^{1.27\pm 0.07}$ with a total scatter of $\Delta_{rms}=$ 0.52 dex in the $\log(M_{BH})$
direction. However, and importantly, we discover that the ES/S0-type galaxies with disks are offset
from the E-type galaxies by more than a factor of ten in their $M_{BH}/M_{*,sph}$ ratio, with ramifications
for formation theories, simulations, and some virial factor measurements used to convert AGN virial
masses into $M_{BH}$. Separately, each population follows a steeper relation with slopes of $1.86\pm0.20$
and $1.90\pm0.20$, respectively. The offset mass ratio is mainly due to the exclusion of the disk
mass, with the two populations offset by only a factor of two in their $M_{BH}/M_{*,gal}$ ratio in
the $M_{BH}$-$M_{*,gal}$ diagram where $M_{BH}\propto M_{*,gal}^{1.8\pm 0.2}$ and $\Delta_{rms}=0.6\pm
0.1$ dex depending on the sample. For $M_{BH} \gtrsim 10^7 M_{\odot}$, we detect no significant
bend nor offset in either the $M_{BH}$-$M_{*,sph}$ or $M_{BH}$-$M_{*,gal}$ relations due to barred
versus non-barred, or core-S\'ersic versus S\'ersic, early-type galaxies. For reference, the
ensemble of late-type galaxies (which invariably are S\'ersic galaxies) follow $M_{BH}$-$M_{*,sph}$
and $M_{BH}$-$M_{*,gal}$ relations with slopes equal to $2.16\pm 0.32$ and $3.05\pm 0.70$, respectively.
Finally, we provide some useful conversion coefficients, $\upsilon$, accounting for the different
stellar mass-to-light ratios used in the literature, and we report the discovery of a local, compact
massive spheroid in NGC 5252.
