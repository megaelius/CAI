We seek to understand this transition using numerical simulations. We use three-dimensional simulations
of turbulent magnetohydrodynamic convection in spherical shell segments covering the full $360\degr$
longitudinal range and latitudes within $\pm75\degr$. We consider angular velocities between
one and 31 times solar. We find a transition from axi- to nonaxisymmetric solutions at around 1.8
time solar rotation that coincides with the simultaneous change of the rotation profiles from antisolar
to solar-like ones. In the solar-like rotation regime, the field configuration consists of an axisymmetric
oscillatory field accompanied with the first azimuthal mode $m=1$ (two active longitudes), which
also shows temporal variability. At slow (rapid) rotation the axisymmetric (nonaxisymmetric)
mode dominates. The axisymmetric mode produces latitudinal dynamo waves with polarity reversals,
while the nonaxisymmetric mode often exhibits a drift in the rotational reference frame and the
strengths of the active longitudes change cyclically over time between the different hemispheres.
The latter two phenomena are azimuthal dynamo waves. In the majority of cases we find retrograde
waves -- in disagreement with observations. In an activity--period diagram, the cycle lengths
normalized to the rotation period fall on clearly distinct branches as a function of rotation or
magnetic activity level. We can clearly identify the inactive branch, but the active and superactive
branches appear to be merged into one. As the rotation rate increases, the length scale of convection
is decreasing, and the supercriticality of convection is decreasing. The results presented are
the first step to understand dynamos in stars with vastly varying rotation rates, with many new findings,
but they also clearly indicate the need for high-resolution simulations in a more supercritical
regime with grids that cover full spheres.
