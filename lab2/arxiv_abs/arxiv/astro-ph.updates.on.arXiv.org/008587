The recent tentative detection by the EDGES Low-Band antenna of the hydrogen 21-cm line from cosmic
dawn, if confirmed, is the first ever signature observed from the epoch of primordial star formation.
However, the magnitude and the shape of this signal are incompatible with standard astrophysical
predictions, requiring either colder than expected gas, or an excess radio background above the
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. In this paper we explore the latter option, investigating
possible 21-cm signals in models with a phenomenological excess radio background together with
the standard astrophysical modeling. Assuming uniform radiation with a synchrotron-like spectrum
existing throughout cosmic history, we show that such a radio background, in addition to explaining
the EDGES Low-Band signal, enhances the power spectrum. The signal during cosmic dawn and reionization
strongly depends on both the intensity of the radio background and the astrophysical parameters.
We verify the broad agreement of our models with the detected feature, including additional constraints
from the EDGES High-Band data, high-redshift quasars, and observational limits on the extragalactic
radio background. The data imply a lower limit on the star formation efficiency of 2.8\%, an upper
limit on the minimum mass of star-forming halos of M$_{\rm h}\sim 10^9$ M$_\odot$ at $z = 17$, and
a lower limit on the excess radio background of 1.9 times the CMB at the 78 MHz cosmic dawn frequency
(corresponding to 0.1\% of the CMB at 1.42 GHz). The properties of X-ray sources remain unconstrained.
We also show that during the dark ages, such a radio background saturates the 21-cm signal, imprinting
a unique signature in both the global signal and the power spectrum.
