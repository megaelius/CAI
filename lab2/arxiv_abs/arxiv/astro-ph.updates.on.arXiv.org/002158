One of the very first steps astronomers working in stellar physics perform to advance in their studies,
is to determine the most common/relevant physical parameters of the objects of study (effective
temperature, bolometric luminosity, surface gravity, etc.). Different methodologies exist
depending on the nature of the data, intrinsic properties of the objects, etc. One common approach
is to compare the observational data with theoretical models passed through some simulator that
will leave in the synthetic data the same imprint than the observational data carries, and see what
set of parameters reproduce the observations best. Even in this case, depending on the kind of data
the astronomer has, the methodology changes slightly. After parameters are published, the community
tend to quote, praise and criticize them, sometimes paying little attention on whether the possible
discrepancies come from the theoretical models, the data themselves or just the methodology used
in the analysis. In this work we perform the simple, yet interesting, exercise of comparing the effective
temperatures obtained via SED and more detailed spectral fittings (to the same grid of models),
of a sample of well known and characterized young M-type objects members to different star forming
regions and show how differences in temperature of up to 350 K can be expected just from the difference
in methodology/data used. On the other hand we show how these differences are smaller for colder
objects even when the complexity of the fit increases like for example introducing differential
extinction. To perform this exercise we benefit greatly from the framework offered by the Virtual
Observatory.
