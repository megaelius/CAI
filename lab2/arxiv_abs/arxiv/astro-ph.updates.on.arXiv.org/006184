We present the Technicolor Dawn simulations, a suite of cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic
simulations of the first 1.2 billion years. By modeling a spatially-inhomogeneous UVB on-the-fly
with 24 frequencies and resolving dark matter halos down to $10^8 M_\odot$ within 12 $h^{-1}$ Mpc
volumes, our simulations unify observations of the intergalactic and circumgalactic media, galaxies,
and reionization into a common framework. The only empirically-tuned parameter, the fraction
$f_{\mathrm{esc,gal}}(z)$ of ionizing photons that escape the interstellar medium, is adjusted
to match observations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and the cosmic microwave background. With this
single calibration, our simulations reproduce the history of reionization; the stellar mass-star
formation rate relation of galaxies; the number density and metallicity of damped Lyman-$\alpha$
absorbers (DLAs) at $z\sim5$; the abundance of weak metal absorbers; the ultraviolet background
(UVB) amplitude; and the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux power spectrum at $z=5.4$. The galaxy stellar mass
and UV luminosity functions are underproduced by $\leq2\times$, suggesting an overly vigorous
feedback model. The mean transmission in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest is underproduced at $z<6$,
indicating tension between measurements of the UVB amplitude and Lyman-$\alpha$ transmission.
The observed SiIV column density distribution is reasonably well-reproduced ($\sim 1\sigma$
low). By contrast, CIV remains significantly underproduced despite being boosted by an intense
$>4$ Ryd UVB. Solving this problem by increasing metal yields would overproduce both weak absorbers
and DLA metallicities. Instead, the observed strength of high-ionization emission from high-redshift
galaxies and absorption from their environments suggest that the ionizing flux from conventional
stellar population models is too soft.
