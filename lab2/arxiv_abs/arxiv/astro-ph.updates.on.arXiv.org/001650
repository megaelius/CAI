Centaurs are the transitional population between trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) and Jupiter-family
comets. For this reason it is possible to access the smaller ones, which is more difficult to do with
the TNO population. The goal of this work is to characterize a set of 16 Centaurs in terms of their size,
albedo, and thermal properties. We study the correlations, for a more extended sample obtained
from the literature, of diameter, albedo, orbital parameters, and spectral slopes. We performed
three-band photometric observations using Herschel-PACS and used a consistent method for the
data reduction and aperture photometry of this sample to obtain monochromatic flux densities at
70, 100, and 160 $\mu$m. Additionally, we used Spitzer-MIPS flux densities at 24 and 70 $\mu$m when
available. We also included in our Centaur sample scattered disk objects (SDOs), a dynamical family
of TNOS, using results previously published by our team, and some Centaurs observed only with the
Spitzer/MIPS instrument. We have determined new radiometric sizes and albedos of 16 Centaurs.
The first conclusion is that the albedos of Centaur objects are not correlated with their orbital
parameters. Similarly, there is no correlation between diameter and orbital parameters. Most
of the objects in our sample are dark (pv < 7%) and most of them are small (D < 120km). However,
there is no correlation between albedo and diameter, in particular for the group of the small objects
as albedo values are homogeneously distributed between 4 to 16%. The correlation with the color
of the objects showed that red objects are all small (mean diameter 65 km), while the gray ones span
a wide range of sizes (mean diameter 120 km). Moreover, the gray objects tend to be darker, with a mean
albedo of 5.6%, compared with a mean of 8.5% (ranging from 5 to 15%) for the red objects.
