Searches for continuous gravitational waves from rapidly spinning neutron stars normally assume
that the star rotates about one of its principal axes of moment of inertia, and hence the gravitational
radiation emits only at twice the spin frequency of the star, $2f_\star$. The superfluid interior
of a star pinned to the crust along an axis non-aligned with any of its principal axes allows the star
to emit gravitational waves at both $f_\star$ and $2f_\star$, even without free precession, a phenomenon
not clearly observed in known pulsars. The dual-harmonic emission mechanism motivates searches
combining the two frequency components of a signal to improve signal-to-noise ratio. We describe
an economical, semicoherent, hidden Markov model (HMM) based, dual-harmonic tracking scheme,
combined with a maximum likelihood coherent matched filter, $\mathcal{F}$-statistic, and demonstrate
its performance through Monte-Carlo simulations. We find that for sources emitting gravitational
waves at both $f_\star$ and $2f_\star$, the rate of correctly recovering synthetic signals (i.e.,
detection efficiency) can be improved by $\sim 10\%$-$70\%$ by tracking two frequencies simultaneously
compared to searching $2f_\star$ only, at a given false alarm probability. For sources emitting
at $2f_\star$ only, dual-harmonic tracking only leads to minor sensitivity loss with $\lesssim
10\%$ lower detection efficiency, compared to searching $2f_\star$ only. The computationally
efficient HMM tracking algorithm provides an option of conducting both dual-harmonic tracking
and a conventional $2f_\star$ search to obtain optimal sensitivity with almost no additional cost.
