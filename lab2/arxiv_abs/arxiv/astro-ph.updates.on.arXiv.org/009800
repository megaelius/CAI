The Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey is an ongoing
imaging and spectroscopic campaign initially designed to study the effects of environment on galaxy
evolution in high-redshift ($z\sim1$) large-scale structures. We use its rich data in combination
with a powerful new technique, Voronoi tessellation Monte-Carlo (VMC) mapping, to search for serendipitous
galaxy overdensities at $0.55 < z < 1.37$ within 15 ORELSE fields, a combined spectroscopic footprint
of $\sim$1.4 square degrees. Through extensive tests with both observational data and our own mock
galaxy catalogs, we optimize the method's many free parameters to maximize its efficacy for general
overdensity searches. Our overdensity search yielded 402 new overdensity candidates with precisely
measured redshifts and an unprecedented sensitivity down to low total overdensity masses ($\mathcal{M}_{tot}
\gtrsim 5\times 10^{13} M_{\odot}$). Using the mock catalogs, we estimated the purity and completeness
of our overdensity catalog as a function of redshift, total mass, and spectroscopic redshift fraction,
finding impressive levels of both 0.92/0.83 and 0.60/0.49 for purity/completeness at $z=0.8$
and $z=1.2$, respectively, for all overdensity masses at spectroscopic fractions of $\sim$20%.
With VMC mapping, we are able to measure precise systemic redshifts, provide an estimate of the total
gravitating mass, and maintain high levels of purity and completeness at $z\sim1$ even with only
moderate levels of spectroscopy. Other methods (e.g., red-sequence overdensities and hot medium
reliant detections) begin to fail at similar redshifts, which attests to VMC mapping's potential
to be a powerful tool for current and future wide-field galaxy evolution surveys at $z\sim1$ and
beyond.
