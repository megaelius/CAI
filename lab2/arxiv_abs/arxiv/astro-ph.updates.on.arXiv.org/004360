The behavior of an interior test particle in the secular 3-body problem has been studied extensively.
A well-known feature is the Lidov-Kozai resonance in which the test particle's argument of periapse
librates about $\pm 90^\circ$ and large oscillations in eccentricity and inclination are possible.
Less explored is the inverse problem: the dynamics of an exterior test particle and an interior perturber.
We survey numerically the inverse secular problem, expanding the potential to hexadecapolar order
and correcting an error in the published expansion. Four secular resonances are uncovered that
persist in full $N$-body treatments (in what follows, $\varpi$ and $\Omega$ are the longitudes
of periapse and of ascending node, $\omega$ is the argument of periapse, and subscripts 1 and 2 refer
to the inner perturber and outer test particle): (i) an orbit-flipping quadrupole resonance requiring
a non-zero perturber eccentricity $e_1$, in which $\Omega_2-\varpi_1$ librates about $\pm 90^\circ$;
(ii) a hexadecapolar resonance (the "inverse Kozai" resonance) for perturbers that are circular
or nearly so and inclined by $I \simeq 63^\circ/117^\circ$, in which $\omega_2$ librates about
$\pm 90^\circ$ and which can vary the particle eccentricity by $\Delta e_2 \simeq 0.2$ and lead to
orbit crossing; (iii) an octopole "apse-aligned" resonance at $I \simeq 46^\circ/107^\circ$
wherein $\varpi_2 - \varpi_1$ librates about $0^\circ$ and $\Delta e_2$ grows with $e_1$; and (iv)
an octopole resonance at $I \simeq 73^\circ/134^\circ$ wherein $\varpi_2 + \varpi_1 - 2 \Omega_2$
librates about $0^\circ$ and $\Delta e_2$ can be as large as 0.3 for small $e_1 \neq 0$. The more eccentric
the perturber, the more the particle's eccentricity and inclination vary; also, more polar orbits
are more chaotic. Our inverse solutions may be applied to the Kuiper belt and debris disks, circumbinary
planets, and stellar systems.
