[Abridged]We investigate the long-term secular dynamics and Lidov-Kozai(LK) eccentricity oscillations
of quadruple systems composed of two binaries at quadrupole and octupole order in the perturbing
Hamiltonian. We show that the fraction of systems reaching high eccentricities is enhanced relative
to triple systems, over a broader range of parameter space. We show that this fraction grows with
time, unlike triple systems evolved at quadrupole order. This is fundamentally because with their
additional degrees of freedom, quadruple systems do not have a maximal set of commuting constants
of the motion, even in secular theory at quadrupole order. We discuss these results in the context
of star-star and white dwarf-white dwarf(WD) binaries, with emphasis on WD-WD mergers and collisions
relevant to the Type Ia supernova problem. For star-star systems, we find that more than 30% of systems
reach high eccentricity within a Hubble time, potentially forming triple systems via stellar mergers
or close binaries. For WD-WD systems, taking into account general relativistic and tidal precession
and dissipation, we show that the merger rate is enhanced in quadruple systems relative to triple
systems by a factor of 3.5-10, and that the long-term evolution of quadruple systems leads to a delay-time
distribution ~1/t for mergers and collisions. In GW-driven mergers of compact objects, we classify
the mergers by their evolutionary patterns in phase space and identify a regime in ~8% of orbital
shrinking mergers, where eccentricity oscillations occur on the general relativistic precession
timescale, rather than the much longer LK timescale. Finally, we generalize previous treatments
of oscillations in the inner binary eccentricity to eccentric mutual orbits. We assess the merger
rate in quadruple and triple systems and the implications for their viability as progenitors of
stellar mergers and SNe Ia.
