Over the past decade increasingly robust estimates of the dense molecular gas content in galaxy
populations between redshift 0 and the peak of cosmic galaxy/star formation from redshift 1-3 have
become available. This rapid progress has been possible due to the advent of powerful ground-based,
and space telescopes for combined study of several millimeter to far-IR, line or continuum tracers
of the molecular gas and dust components. The main conclusions of this review are: 1. Star forming
galaxies contained much more molecular gas at earlier cosmic epochs than at the present time. 2.
The galaxy integrated depletion time scale for converting the gas into stars depends primarily
on z or Hubble time, and at a given z, on the vertical location of a galaxy along the star-formation
rate versus stellar mass "main-sequence" (MS) correlation. 3. Global rates of galaxy gas accretion
primarily control the evolution of the cold molecular gas content and star formation rates of the
dominant MS galaxy population, which in turn vary with the cosmological expansion. A second key
driver may be global disk fragmentation in high-z, gas rich galaxies, which ties local free-fall
time scales to galactic orbital times, and leads to rapid radial matter transport and bulge growth.
Third, the low star formation efficiency inside molecular clouds is plausibly set by super-sonic
streaming motions, and internal turbulence, which in turn may be driven by conversion of gravitational
energy at high-z, and/or by local feedback from massive stars at low-z. 4. A simple 'gas regulator'
model is remarkably successful in predicting the combined evolution of molecular gas fractions,
star formation rates, galactic winds, and gas phase metallicities.
