The interaction between emerging and pre-existing magnetic fields in the solar atmosphere can
trigger several dynamic phenomena, such as eruptions and jets. A key element during this interaction
is the formation of large scale current sheets and, eventually, their fragmentation that leads
to the creation of a strongly turbulent environment. In this paper, we study the kinetic aspects
of the interaction (reconnection) between emerging and ambient magnetic fields. We show that the
statistical properties of the spontaneously fragmented and fractal electric fields are responsible
for the efficient heating and acceleration of charged particles, which form a power law tail at high
energies on sub-second time scales. A fraction of the energized particles escapes from the acceleration
volume, with a super-hot component with temperature close to $150\,$MK, and with a power law high
energy tail with index between -2 and -3. We estimate the transport coefficients in energy space
from the dynamics of the charged particles inside the fragmented and fractal electric fields, and
the solution of a fractional transport equation, as appropriate for a strongly turbulent plasma,
agrees with the test particle simulations. We also show that the acceleration mechanism is not related
to Fermi acceleration, and the Fokker Planck equation is inconsistent and not adequate as a transport
model. Finally, we address the problem of correlations between spatial transport and transport
in energy space. Our results confirm the observations reported for high energy particles (hard
X-rays, type III bursts and solar energetic particles) during the emission of solar jets.
