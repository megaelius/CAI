Context. Solar equatorial Rossby waves (r modes) have recently been observed in the horizontal
flow field near the solar surface. This discovery used the techniques of granulation-tracking
and ring-diagram analysis applied to six years of SDO/HMI data. Aims. Here we apply time-distance
helioseismology to the SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI data, which cover 21 years of observations from May
1996 to April 2017. The goal of this study is to provide an independent confirmation of the solar r
modes over two solar cycles and in deeper layers of the Sun. Methods. We measure south-north helioseismic
travel times along the equator, which are sensitive to subsurface north-south flows. To reduce
noise, the travel times are averaged over travel distances from 6$^\circ$ to 30$^\circ$; the mean
distance corresponds to a p-mode lower turning point of 0.91 $R_\odot$. The 21-year time series
of travel-time measurements is split into three seven-year subsets and transformed to obtain power
spectra in a co-rotating frame. Results. The power spectra all show peaks near the frequencies of
the classical Rossby waves for azimuthal wavenumbers in the range $3 \leq m \leq 15$. The mode frequencies
and linewidths of the modes with $m \leq 9$ are consistent with a previous study. Modes with $m \geq
10$ are shifted toward less negative frequencies by 10--20 nHz. While most of these modes have e-folding
lifetimes on the order of a few months, the longest lived mode, $m=3$, has an e-folding lifetime of
more than one year. The rms north-south flow speed associated with r modes along the equator is estimated
to be in the range of 1--3 m s$^{-1}$, with the largest values for $m\sim10$. No evidence for the $m
= 2$ mode is found in the power spectrum, implying that the rms velocity of this mode is below $\sim$0.5
m s$^{-1}$.
