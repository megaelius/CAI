Active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback is expected to impact the amount of cold gas in galaxies by
driving strong galactic winds, by preventing external gas inflows, or by changing the thermodynamical
state of the gas. We use molecular gas mass estimates based on dust absorption (H$\alpha$/H$\beta$)
to study gas content of large samples of type 2 AGN host galaxies in comparison with inactive galaxies.
Using sparse principal component and clustering analysis, we analyze a suite of stellar and structural
parameters of $\sim 27,100$ face-on, central galaxies at redshift $z = 0.02-0.15$ and with stellar
mass $M_\star \approx 10^{10}-2\times 10^{11}\,M_\odot$. We identify four galaxy groups of similar
mass and morphology (mass surface density, velocity dispersion, concentration, and S\'{e}rsic
index) that can be evolutionarily linked through a lifecycle wherein gas content mediates their
star formation rate (SFR) and level of AGN activity. Galaxies first consume their gas mostly through
bursty star formation, then enter into a transition phase of intermediate gas richness in which
star formation and AGNs coexist, before settling into retirement as gas-poor, quiescent systems
with residual levels of AGN activity (LINERs). Strongly accreting black holes (Seyferts) live
in gas-rich, star-forming hosts, but neither their gas reservoir nor their ability to form stars
seem to be impacted \emph{instantaneously} (timescales $\lesssim 0.5$\,Gyr) by AGN feedback.
Our results are inconsistent with AGN feedback models that predict that central, bulge-dominated,
Seyfert-like AGNs in massive galaxies have significantly lower molecular gas fractions compared
to inactive galaxies of similar mass, morphology, and SFR.
