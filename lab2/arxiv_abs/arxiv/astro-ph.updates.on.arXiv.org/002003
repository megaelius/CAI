We use detailed nucleosynthesis calculations and a realistic prescription for the environment
of the first stars to explore the first episodes of chemical enrichment that occurred during the
dark ages. Based on these calculations, we propose a novel explanation for the increased prevalence
of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars with decreasing Fe abundance: The observed chemistry
for the most metal-poor Galactic halo stars is the result of an intimate link between the explosions
of the first stars and their host minihalo's ability to retain its gas. Specifically, high energy
supernovae produce a near solar ratio of C/Fe, but are effective in evacuating the gas from their
host minihalo, thereby suppressing the formation of a second generation of stars. On the other hand,
minihalos that host low energy supernovae are able to retain their gas and form a second stellar generation
but, as a result, the second stars are borne with a supersolar ratio of C/Fe. Our models are able to
accurately reproduce the observed distributions of [C/Fe] and [Fe/H], as well as the fraction of
CEMP stars relative to non-CEMP stars as a function of [Fe/H] without any free parameters. We propose
that the present lack of chemical evidence for very massive stars (>140 Msun), that ended their
life as a highly energetic pair-instability supernova, does not imply that such stars were rare
or did not exist; the chemical products of these very massive first stars may have escaped from their
host minihalo, and were never incorporated into subsequent generations of stars. Finally, our
models suggest that the most Fe-poor stars currently known may have seen the enrichment from a small
multiple of metal-free stars, and need not have been exclusively enriched by a solitary first star.
These calculations support the idea that some of the surviving dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky
Way are relics of the first galaxies.
