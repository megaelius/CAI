The completed eBOSS catalogues contain redshifts of 344080 QSOs over 0.8<z<2.2 covering 4808 deg$^2$,
174816 LRGs over 0.6<z<1.0 covering 4242 deg$^2$ and 173736 ELGs over 0.6<z<1.1 covering 1170 deg$^2$
in order to constrain the expansion history of the Universe and the growth rate of structure through
clustering measurements. Mechanical limitations of the fibre-fed spectrograph on the Sloan telescope
prevent two fibres being placed closer than 62", the fibre-collision scale, in a single pass of the
instrument on the sky. These `fibre collisions' strongly correlate with the intrinsic clustering
of targets and can bias measurements of the two-point correlation function resulting in a systematic
error on the inferred values of the cosmological parameters. We combine the new techniques of pairwise-inverse-probability
weighting and the angular up-weighting to correct the clustering measurements for the effect of
fibre collisions. Using mock catalogues we show that our corrections provide unbiased measurements,
within data precision, of both the projected correlation function $w_p$ and the multipoles $\xi^l$
of the redshift-space correlation functions down to 0.1Mpc/h, regardless of the tracer type. We
apply the corrections to the eBOSS DR16 catalogues. We find that, on scales greater than s~20Mpc/h
for $\xi^l$, as used to make BAO and large-scale RSD measurements, approximate methods such as Nearest-Neighbour
up-weighting are sufficiently accurate given the statistical errors of the data. Using the PIP
method, for the first time for a spectroscopic program of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey we are able
to successfully access the 1-halo term in the 3D clustering measurements down to ~0.1Mpc/h scales.
Our results will therefore allow studies that use the small-scale clustering measurements to strengthen
the constraints on both cosmological parameters and the halo-occupation distribution models.
