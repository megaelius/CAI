In this work, we compiled a sample of 202 Fermi/LAT blazars with available broad line emissions.
Out of the 202 sources, 66 have known Doppler factors. The correlation between ($\gamma$-ray) and
broad-line emission, and that between radio and broad-line emission are investigated by removing
the effects of redshift and beaming boosting for the whole sample and the subclasses, flat spectrum
radio quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) respectively. We obtained a strong positive
correlation between ($\gamma$-ray) and broad-line emission and between radio and broad-line
emission for the 202 blazars; It is worth noting that the correlation still exists after removing
redshift effect. For the 66 sources with Doppler factors, there is also a positive correlation between
($\gamma$-ray) and broad-line emission after removing the Doppler factors, as well as that between
radio and broad-line emission. Our analysis suggest that 1. There are strong correlations between
the ($\gamma$-ray) and the broad line emission for the whole blazar sample and their subclasses.
The correlations exist when the redshift effect is removed for the whole sample and their subclasses,
confirming the results by Ghisellini et al. (2014) and Chen (2018). 2. For the 66 blazars with available
Doppler factors, a strong correlation between the broad line emission and the Doppler factor is
found. The correlation between the ($\gamma$-ray) and the broad line emission exists after the
Doppler factor effect is removed. Similar results for 1 and 2 also obtained between radio and broad-line
emission. 3. Our analysis suggests a robust connection between the accretion process and the jet.
