We introduce the IllustrisTNG project, a new suite of cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations
performed with the moving-mesh code AREPO employing an updated Illustris galaxy formation model.
Here we focus on the general properties of magnetic fields and the diffuse radio emission in galaxy
clusters. Magnetic fields are prevalent in galaxies, and their build-up is closely linked to structure
formation. We find that structure formation amplifies the initial seed fields ($10^{-14}$ comoving
Gauss) to the values observed in low-redshift galaxies ($1-10\,\mu G$). The magnetic field topology
is closely connected to galaxy morphology such that irregular fields are hosted by early-type galaxies,
while large-scale, ordered fields are present in disc galaxies. Using a simple model for the energy
distribution of relativistic electrons we predict the diffuse radio emission of $280$ clusters
with a baryonic mass resolution of $1.1\times 10^{7}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$, and generate mock observations
for VLA, LOFAR, ASKAP and SKA. Our simulated clusters show extended radio emission, whose detectability
correlates with their virial mass. We reproduce the observed scaling relations between total radio
power and X-ray emission, $M_{500}$, and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich $Y_{\rm 500}$ parameter. The
radio emission surface brightness profiles of our most massive clusters are in reasonable agreement
with VLA measurements of Coma and Perseus. Finally, we discuss the fraction of detected extended
radio haloes as a function of virial mass and source count functions for different instruments.
Overall our results agree encouragingly well with observations, but a refined analysis requires
a more sophisticated treatment of relativistic particles in large-scale galaxy formation simulations.
