The presence of a bright "photon ring" surrounding a dark "black hole shadow" has been discussed
as an important feature of the observational appearance of emission originating near a black hole.
We clarify the meaning and relevance of these heuristics with analytic calculations and numerical
toy models. The standard usage of the term "shadow" describes the appearance of a black hole illuminated
from all directions, including from behind the observer. A backlit black hole casts a somewhat larger
shadow. Neither shadow heuristic is particularly relevant to understanding the appearance of
emission originating near the black hole, where the emission profile and gravitational redshift
play the dominant roles in determining the observed size of the central dark area. A photon ring results
from light rays that orbit near the black hole before escaping to infinity, where they arrive near
a ring-shaped "critical curve" on the image plane. Although the brightness can become arbitrarily
large near this critical curve in the case of optically thin emitting matter, we show that the enhancement
is only logarithmic, and hence is of no relevance to present observations. For optically thin emission
from a geometrically thin or thick disk, photons that make only a fraction of an orbit will generically
give rise to a much wider "lensing ring," which is a demagnified image of the back of the disk, superimposed
on top of the direct emission. The lensing ring is centered at a radius ~5% larger than the photon ring
and its width is ~0.5-1M. It can be relatively brighter by a factor of 2-3 and thus could provide a significant
feature in high resolution images. Nevertheless, the characteristic features of the observed
image are dominated by the location and properties of the emitting matter near the black hole. We
comment on the recent M87* Event Horizon Telescope observations and mass measurement.
