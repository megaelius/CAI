Purpose: This paper presents a full fourth-order model of the gravity gradient torque of spacecraft
around asteroids by taking into consideration of the inertia integrals of the spacecraft up to the
fourth order, which is an improvement of the previous fourth-order model of the gravity gradient
torque. Design, methodology and approach: The fourth-order gravitational potential of the spacecraft
is derived based on Taylor expansion. Then the expression of the gravity gradient torque in terms
of gravitational potential derivatives is derived. By using the formulation of the gravitational
potential, explicit formulations of the full fourth-order gravity gradient torque are obtained.
Then a numerical simulation is carried out to verify our model. Findings: We find that our model is
more sound and precise than the previous fourth-order model due to the consideration of higher-order
inertia integrals of the spacecraft. Numerical simulation results show that the motion of the previous
fourth-order model is quite different from the exact motion, while our full fourth-order model
fits the exact motion very well. Our full fourth-order model is precise enough for high-precision
attitude dynamics and control around asteroids. Practical implications: This high-precision
model is of importance for the future asteroids missions for scientific explorations and near-Earth
objects mitigation. Originality and value: In comparison with the previous model, a gravity gradient
torque model around asteroids that is more sound and precise is established. This model is valuable
for high-precision attitude dynamics and control around asteroids.
