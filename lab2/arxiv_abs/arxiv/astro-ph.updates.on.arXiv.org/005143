Given rapid photodissociation and photodegradation, the recently discovered organics in the
Martian subsurface and atmosphere were probably delivered in geologically recent times. Possible
parent bodies are C-type asteroids, comets, and interplanetary dust particles (IDPs). The dust
infall rate was estimated, using different methods, to be between $0.71$ and $2.96 \times 10^6$
kg/yr (Nesvorny et al., 2011, Borin et al., 2017, Crismani et al., 2017); assuming a carbon content
of 10% (Flynn, 1996), this implies an IDP carbon flux of $0.07 - 0.3 \times 10^6$ kg/yr. We calculate
for the first time the carbon flux from impacts of asteroids and comets. To this end, we perform dynamical
simulations of impact rates on Mars. We use the N-body integrator RMVS/Swifter to propagate the
Sun and the eight planets from their current positions. We separately add comets and asteroids to
the simulations as massless test particles, based on their current orbital elements, yielding
Mars impact rates of $4.34\times10^{-3}$ comets/Myr and 3.3 asteroids/Myr. We estimate the global
carbon flux on Mars from cometary impacts to be $\sim 0.013 \times 10^{6}$~kg/yr within an order
of magnitude, while asteroids deliver $\sim 0.05 \times 10^6$~kg/yr. These values correspond
to $\sim 4-19 \%$ and $\sim 17-71 \%$, respectively, of the IDP-borne carbon flux estimated by Nesvorny
et al. 2011, Borin et al. 2017 and Crismani et al. 2017. Unlike the spatially homogeneous IDP infall,
impact ejecta are distributed locally, concentrated around the impact site. We find organics from
asteroids and comets to dominate over IDP-borne organics at distances up to 150~km from the crater
center. Our results may be important for the interpretation of in situ detections of organics on
Mars.
