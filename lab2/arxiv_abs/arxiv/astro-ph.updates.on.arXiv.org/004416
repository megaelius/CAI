According to sensitivity studies, the $^{38}\mathrm{K}\left( p, \gamma \right){}^{39}\mathrm{Ca}$
reaction has a significant influence on $\mathrm{Ar}$, $\mathrm{K}$, and $\mathrm{Ca}$ production
in classical novae. In order to constrain the rate of this reaction, we have performed a direct measurement
of the strengths of three candidate $\ell = 0$ resonances within the Gamow window, at $386 \pm 10~\mathrm{keV}$,
$515 \pm 10~\mathrm{keV}$, and $689 \pm 10~\mathrm{keV}$. The experiment was performed in inverse
kinematics using a beam of unstable $^{38}\mathrm{K}$ impinged on a windowless $\mathrm{H}_2$
target. The $^{39}\mathrm{Ca}$ recoils and prompt $\gamma$ rays from $^{38}\mathrm{K}\left(
p, \gamma \right){}^{39}\mathrm{Ca}$ reactions were detected in coincidence using a recoil mass
separator and a BGO array, respectively. For the $689$ keV resonance, we observed a clear recoil-$\gamma$
coincidence signal and extracted resonance strength and energy values of $120^{+50}_{-30}~\mathrm{(stat.)}^{+20}_{-60}~\mathrm{(sys.)}~\mathrm{meV}$
and $679^{+2}_{-1}~\mathrm{(stat.)} \pm 1~\mathrm{(sys.)}~\mathrm{keV}$, respectively.
We also performed a singles analysis, extracting a resonance strength of $120 \pm 20~\mathrm{(stat.)}
\pm 15~\mathrm{(sys.)}~\mathrm{meV}$, consistent with the coincidence result. For the $386$
keV and $515$ keV resonances, we extract $90\%$ confidence level upper limits of $2.54$ meV and $18.4$
meV, respectively. We have established a new recommended $^{38}\mathrm{K}(p, \gamma){}^{39}\mathrm{Ca}$
rate based on experimental information, which reduces overall uncertainties near the peak temperatures
of nova burning by a factor of ${\sim} 250$. Using the rate obtained in this work in model calculations
of the hottest oxygen-neon novae reduces overall uncertainties on $\mathrm{Ar}$, $\mathrm{K}$,
and $\mathrm{Ca}$ synthesis to factors of $15$ or less in all cases.
