We present an optical to near-infrared transmission spectrum of the inflated hot Jupiter WASP-52b
using three transit observations from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) mounted
on the Hubble Space Telescope, combined with Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) photometry
at 3.6 microns and 4.5 microns. Since WASP-52 is a moderately active (log(Lx/Lbol) = -4.7) star,
we correct the transit light curves for the effect of stellar activity using ground-based photometric
monitoring data from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) and Tennessee State
University's Automatic Imaging Telescope (AIT). We bin the data in 38 spectrophotometric light
curves from 0.29 to 4.5 microns and measure the transit depths to a median precision of 90 ppm. We compare
the transmission spectrum to a grid of forward atmospheric models and find that our results are consistent
with a cloudy spectrum and evidence of sodium at 2.3-sigma confidence, but no observable evidence
of potassium absorption even in the narrowest spectroscopic channel. We find that the optical transmission
spectrum of WASP-52b is similar to that of the well-studied inflated hot Jupiter HAT-P-1b, which
has comparable surface gravity, equilibrium temperature, mass, radius, and stellar irradiation
levels. At longer wavelengths, however, the best fitting models for WASP-52b and HAT-P-1b predict
quite dissimilar properties, which could be confirmed with observations at wavelengths longer
than ~1 micron. The identification of planets with common atmospheric properties and similar system
parameters will be insightful for comparative atmospheric studies with the James Webb Space Telescope.
