We detect and characterise extended, diffuse radio emission from galaxy clusters at 168 MHz within
the Epoch of Reionization 0-hour field; a $45^\circ \times 45^\circ$ region of the southern sky
centred on R. A. $= 0^\circ$, decl. $=-27^\circ$. We detect 31 diffuse radio sources; 3 of which are
newly detected haloes in Abell 0141, Abell 2811, and Abell S1121; 2 newly detected relics in Abell
0033 and Abell 2751; 5 new halo candidates and a further 5 new relic candidates. Further, we detect
a new phoenix candidate in Abell 2556 as well as 2 candidate dead radio galaxies at the centres of Abell
0122 and Abell S1136 likely associated with the brightest cluster galaxies. Beyond this we find
2 clusters with unclassifiable, diffuse steep-spectrum emission as well as a candidate double
relic system associated with RXC J2351.0-1934. We present measured source properties such as their
integrated flux densities, spectral indices, and sizes where possible. We find several of the diffuse
sources to be ultra-steep including the halo in Abell 0141 which has $\alpha \leq -2.1 \pm 0.1$ making
it one of the steepest halos known. Finally, we compare our sample of haloes with previously detected
haloes and revisit established scaling relations of the radio halo power ($P_{1.4}$) with the cluster
X-ray luminosity ($L_{\mathrm{X}}$) and mass ($M_{500}$). We find consistent fitting parameters
for assumed power law relationships, and find that the $P_{1.4}-L_{\mathrm{X}}$ has less raw scatter
than the corresponding $P_{1.4}-M_{500}$ despite inhomogeneous $L_{\mathrm{X}}$ measurements.
These scaling relation properties are consistent with a sample of only non-cool core clusters hosting
radio haloes.
