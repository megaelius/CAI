We use the Fisher-matrix formalism to investigate whether the galaxy bispectrum in redshift space,
$B$, contains additional cosmological information with respect to the power spectrum, $P$. We
focus on a $\rm \textit{Euclid}$-like survey and consider cosmological models dominated by dark
energy and cold dark matter with Gaussian primordial perturbations. After discussing the phenomenology
of redshift-space distortions for the bispectrum, we derive an expression for the cross-covariance
between $B$ and $P$ at leading order in perturbation theory. Our equation generalizes previous
results that did not consider binning in the orientation of wavevector triangles with respect to
the line of sight. By considering Fourier modes with wavenumber $k<0.15 \,h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, we find
that $B$ and $P$ set similar constraints on the cosmological parameters. Generally, error bars
only moderately improve when the two probes are combined together. The parameters that describe
a dynamical dark-energy equation of state, however, form an interesting exception: their joint
68.3 per cent credible region shrinks by a factor of 2.6 with respect to only using the power spectrum.
Regrettably, this improvement is canceled out when the clustering analysis is combined with priors
based on current studies of the cosmic microwave background. In this case, combining $B$ and $P$
does not give any appreciable benefit other than allowing a precise determination of galaxy bias.
Finally, we discuss how results depend on the binning strategy for the clustering statistics as
well as on the maximum wavenumber. We also show that only considering the bispectrum monopole leads
to a significant loss of information.
