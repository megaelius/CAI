Imaging billions of galaxies every few nights during ten years, LSST should be a major contributor
to precision cosmology in the 2020 decade. High precision photometric data will be available in
six bands, from near-infrared to near-ultraviolet. The computation of precise, unbiased, photometric
redshifts up to z = 2, at least, is one of the main LSST challenges and its performance will have major
impact on all extragalactic LSST sciences. We evaluate the efficiency of our photometric redshift
reconstruction on mock galaxy catalogs up to z=2.45 and estimate the impact of realistic photometric
redshift (hereafter photo-z) reconstruction on the large-scale structures (LSS) power spectrum
and the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale determination for a LSST-like photometric survey.
We study the effectiveness of the BAO scale as a cosmological probe in the LSST survey. We have performed
a detailed modelling of the photo-z distribution as a function of galaxy type, redshift and absolute
magnitude using our photo-z reconstruction code with a quality selection cut based on a Boosted
decision tree (BDT). We have computed the fractional error on the recovered power spectrum which
is dominated by the shot-noise at z>1 for scales k>0.1, due to the photo-z damping. The BAO scale can
be recovered with a percent or better accuracy level from z = 0.5 to z = 1.5 using realistic photo-z
reconstruction. Outliers can represent a significant fraction of galaxies at z>2, causing bias
and errors on LSS power spectrum measurement. Although the BAO scale is not the most powerful cosmological
probe in LSST, it can be used to check the consistency of the LSS measurement. Moreover we show that
the impact of photo-z smearing on the recovered isotropic BAO scale in LSST should stay limited up
to z=1.5, so as long as the galaxy number density balances the photo-z smoothing.
