Cosmic voids offer an extraordinary opportunity to study the effects of massive neutrinos on cosmological
scales. Because they are freely streaming, neutrinos can penetrate the interior of voids more easily
than cold dark matter or baryons, which makes their relative contribution to the mass budget in voids
much higher than elsewhere in the Universe. In simulations it has recently been shown how various
characteristics of voids in the matter distribution are affected by neutrinos, such as their abundance,
density profiles, dynamics, and clustering properties. However, the tracers used to identify
voids in observations (e.g., galaxies or halos) are affected by neutrinos as well, and isolating
the unique neutrino signatures inherent to voids becomes more difficult. In this paper we make use
of the DEMNUni suite of simulations to investigate the clustering bias of voids in Fourier space
as a function of their core density and compensation. We find a clear dependence on the sum of neutrino
masses that remains significant even for void statistics extracted from halos. In particular,
we observe that the amplitude of the linear void bias increases with neutrino mass for voids defined
in dark matter, whereas this trend gets reversed and slightly attenuated when measuring the relative
void-halo bias using voids identified in the halo distribution. Finally, we argue how the original
behaviour can be restored when considering observations of the total matter distribution (e.g.
via weak lensing), and comment on scale-dependent effects in the void bias that may provide additional
information on neutrinos in the future.
