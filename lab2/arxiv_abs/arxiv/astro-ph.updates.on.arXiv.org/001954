This dissertation has been submitted to the Faculdade de Ci\^encias da Universidade do Porto in
partial fulfillment of the requirements for the PhD degree in Astronomy. The scientific results
presented herein follow from the research activity performed under the supervision of Dr. M\'ario
Jo\~ao Monteiro at the Centro de Astrof\'isica da Universidade do Porto and Dr. Hans Kjeldsen at
the Institut for Fysik og Astronomi, Aarhus Universitet. The dissertation is composed of three
chapters and a list of appendices. Chapter 1 serves as an unpretentious and rather general introduction
to the field of asteroseismology of solar-like stars. It starts with a historical account of the
field of asteroseismology followed by a general review of the basic physics and properties of stellar
pulsations. Emphasis is then naturally placed on the stochastic excitation of stellar oscillations
and on the potential of asteroseismic inference. The chapter closes with a discussion about observational
techniques and the observational status of the field. Chapter 2 is devoted to the subject of data
analysis in asteroseismology. This is an extensive subject, therefore, a compilation is presented
of the relevant data analysis methods and techniques employed contemporarily in asteroseismology
of solar-like stars. Special attention has been drawn to the subject of statistical inference both
from the competing Bayesian and frequentist perspectives. The chapter ends with a description
of the implementation of a pipeline for mode parameter analysis of Kepler data. In the course of these
two first chapters, reference is made to a series of articles led by the author (or otherwise having
greatly benefited from his contribution) that can be found in Appendices A to E. Chapter 3 then goes
on to present a series of additional published results.
