Brown dwarf spectra are rich in information revealing of the chemical and physical processes operating
in their atmospheres. We apply a recently developed atmospheric retrieval tool to an ensemble of
late T-dwarf (600-800K) near infrared spectra. With these spectra we are able to place direct constraints
the molecular abundances of H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO, CO$_2$, NH$_3$, H$_2$S, and Na+K, gravity, thermal
structure (and effective temperature), photometric radius, and cloud optical depths. We find
that ammonia, water, methane, and the alkali metals are present and well constrained in all 11 objects.
From the abundance constraints we find no significant trend in the water, methane, or ammonia abundances
with temperature, but find a very strong ($>$25$\sigma$) increasing trend in the alkali metal abundances
with effective temperature, indicative of alkali rainout. We also find little evidence for optically
thick clouds. With the methane and water abundances, we derive the intrinsic atmospheric metallicity
and carbon-to-oxygen ratios. We find in our sample, that metallicities are typically sub solar
and carbon-to-oxygen ratios are somewhat super solar, different than expectations from the local
stellar population. We also find that the retrieved vertical thermal profiles are consistent with
radiative equilibrium over the photospheric regions. Finally, we find that our retrieved effective
temperatures are lower than previous inferences for some objects and that our radii are larger than
expectations from evolutionary models, possibly indicative of un-resolved binaries. This investigation
and methodology represents a paradigm in linking spectra to the determination of the fundamental
chemical and physical processes governing cool brown dwarf atmospheres.
