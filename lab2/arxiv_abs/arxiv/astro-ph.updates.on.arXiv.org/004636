We present numerical models of the nebular emission from H II regions around young stellar populations
over a range of compositions and ages. The synthetic stellar pop- ulations include both single stars
and interacting binary stars. We compare these models to the observed emission lines of 254 HII regions
of 13 nearby spiral galax- ies and 21 dwarf galaxies drawn from archival data. The models are created
using the combination of the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (bpass) code with the photoionization
code cloudy to study the differences caused by the inclusion of interacting binary stars in the stellar
population. We obtain agreement with the observed emission line ratios from the nearby star-forming
regions and discuss the effect of binary star evolution pathways on the nebular ionization of H II
regions. We find that at population ages above 10 Myr, single-star models rapidly decrease in flux
and ionization strength, while binary-star model still produce strong flux and high O III/H\b{eta}
ratios. Our models can reproduce the metallicity of H II regions from spiral galaxies but we find
higher metallicities than previously estimated for the H II regions from dwarf galaxies. Comparing
the equivalent width of H\b{eta} emission between mod- els and observations, we find that accounting
for ionizing photon leakage can affect age estimates for HII regions. When it is included, the typical
age derived for HII regions is 5Myr from single-star models, and up to 10Myr with binary-star models.
This is due to the existence of binary-star evolution pathways which produce more hot WR and helium
stars at older ages. For future reference, we calculate new BPASS binary maximal starburst lines
as a function of metallicity, and for the total model population, and present these in Appendix A.
