Observations of low-mass satellite galaxies in the nearby Universe point towards a strong dichotomy
in their star-forming properties relative to systems with similar mass in the field. Specifically,
satellite galaxies are preferentially gas poor and no longer forming stars, while their field counterparts
are largely gas rich and actively forming stars. Much of the recent work to understand this dichotomy
has been statistical in nature, determining not just that environmental processes are most likely
responsible for quenching these low-mass systems but also that they must operate very quickly after
infall onto the host system, with quenching timescales $\lesssim 2~ {\rm Gyr}$ at ${M}_{\star}
\lesssim 10^{8}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$. This work utilizes the newly-available $Gaia$ DR2 proper motion
measurements along with the Phat ELVIS suite of high-resolution, cosmological, zoom-in simulations
to study low-mass satellite quenching around the Milky Way on an object-by-object basis. We derive
constraints on the infall times for $37$ of the known low-mass satellite galaxies of the Milky Way,
finding that $\gtrsim~70\%$ of the `classical' satellites of the Milky Way are consistent with
the very short quenching timescales inferred from the total population in previous works. The remaining
classical Milky Way satellites have quenching timescales noticeably longer, with $\tau_{\rm
quench} \sim 6 - 8~{\rm Gyr}$, highlighting how detailed orbital modeling is likely necessary to
understand the specifics of environmental quenching for individual satellite galaxies. Additionally,
we find that the $6$ ultra-faint dwarf galaxies with publicly available $HST$-based star-formation
histories are all consistent with having their star formation shut down prior to infall onto the
Milky Way -- which, combined with their very early quenching times, strongly favors quenching driven
by reionization.
