In this data paper we present and characterise the multi-component radio sources identified in
the VLA-COSMOS Large Project at 3 GHz (0.75 arcsec resolution, 2.3 {\mu}Jy/beam rms), i.e. the radio
sources which are composed of two or more radio blobs.The classification of objects into multi-components
was done by visual inspection of 351 of the brightest and most extended blobs from a sample of 10,899
blobs identified by the automatic code blobcat. For that purpose we used multi-wavelength information
of the field, such as the 1.4-GHz VLA-COSMOS data and the UltraVISTA stacked mosaic available for
COSMOS. We have identified 67 multi-component radio sources at 3 GHz: 58 sources with AGN powered
radio emission and 9 star-forming galaxies. We report 8 new detections that were not observed by
the VLA-COSMOS Large Project at 1.4 GHz, due to the slightly larger area coverage at 3 GHz. The increased
spatial resolution of 0.75 arcsec has allowed us to resolve (and isolate) multiple emission peaks
of 28 extended radio sources not identified in the 1.4-GHz VLA-COSMOS map. We report the multi-frequency
flux densities (324 MHz, 325 MHz, 1.4 GHz & 3 GHz), star-formation-rates, and stellar masses of these
objects. Multi-component objects at 3-GHz VLA-COSMOS inhabit mainly massive galaxies (>10^10.5
Msun). The majority of the multi-component AGN lie below the main-sequence of star-forming galaxies
(SFGs), in the green valley and the quiescent region. We provide detailed description of the objects:
amongst the AGN there are 2 head-tail, 10 core-lobe, 9 wide-angle-tail (WAT), 8 double-double or
Z-/X-shaped, 3 bent-tail radio sources, and 26 symmetric sources, while amongst the SFGs we find
the only star-forming ring seen in radio emission in COSMOS. We report a large number (32/58) of disturbed/bent
multi-component AGN, 18 of which do not lie within X-ray groups in COSMOS (0.08 < z < 1.53). [abridged]
