This paper presents 52 X-ray bright galaxy clusters selected within the 11 deg$^2$ XMM-LSS survey.
51 of them have spectroscopic redshifts ($0.05<z<1.06$), one is identified at $z_{\rm phot}=1.9$,
and all together make the high-purity "Class 1" (C1) cluster sample of the XMM-LSS, the highest density
sample of X-ray selected clusters with a monitored selection function. Their X-ray fluxes, averaged
gas temperatures (median $T_X=2$ keV), luminosities (median $L_{X,500}=5\times10^{43}$ ergs/s)
and total mass estimates (median $5\times10^{13} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$) are measured, adapting to
the specific signal-to-noise regime of XMM-LSS observations. The redshift distribution of clusters
shows a deficit of sources when compared to the cosmological expectations, regardless of whether
WMAP-9 or Planck-2013 CMB parameters are assumed. This lack of sources is particularly noticeable
at $0.4 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.9$. However, after quantifying uncertainties due to small number
statistics and sample variance we are not able to put firm (i.e. $>3 \sigma$) constraints on the
presence of a large void in the cluster distribution. We work out alternative hypotheses and demonstrate
that a negative redshift evolution in the normalization of the $L_{X}-T_X$ relation (with respect
to a self-similar evolution) is a plausible explanation for the observed deficit. We confirm this
evolutionary trend by directly studying how C1 clusters populate the $L_{X}-T_X-z$ space, properly
accounting for selection biases. We point out that a systematically evolving, unresolved, central
component in clusters and groups (AGN contamination or cool core) can impact the classification
as extended sources and be partly responsible for the observed redshift distribution.[abridged]
