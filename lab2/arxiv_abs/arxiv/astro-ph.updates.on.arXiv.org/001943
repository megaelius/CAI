The source NRAO150 is a very prominent millimeter to radio emitting quasar at redshift z=1.52 for
which previous millimeter VLBI observations revealed a fast counterclockwise rotation of the
innermost regions of the jet. Here we present new polarimetric multi-epoch VLBI-imaging observations
of NRAO150 performed at 8, 15, 22, 43, and 86GHz with the VLBA and GMVA between 2006 and 2010. All new
and previous observational evidence are consistent with an interpretation of the source behavior
where the jet is seen at an extremely small angle to the line of sight, and the high frequency emitting
regions in NRAO150 rotate at high speeds on the plane of the sky with respect to a reference point that
does not need to be related to any particularly prominent jet feature. The observed polarization
angle distribution at 22, 43, and 86 GHz during observing epochs with high polarization degree suggests
that we have detected the toroidal component of the magnetic field threading the innermost jet plasma
regions. This is also consistent with the lower degree of polarization detected at progressively
poorer angular resolutions, where the integrated polarization intensity produced by the toroidal
field is explained by polarization cancellation inside the observing beam. All this evidence is
fully consistent with a kinematic scenario where the main kinematic and polarization properties
of the 43 GHz emitting structure of NRAO150 are explained by the internal rotation of such emission
regions around the jet axis when the jet is seen almost face on. A simplified model developed to fit
helical trajectories to the observed kinematics of the 43 GHz features fully supports this hypothesis.
This explains the kinematics of the innermost regions of the jet in NRAO150 in terms of internal jet
rotation.
