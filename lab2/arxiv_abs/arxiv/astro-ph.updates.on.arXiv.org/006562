We present a robust census of ionized gas outflows in normal galaxies at 0.6<z<2.7 with 9.0<log(M*/Msun)<11.7.
The sample of 599 objects fairly homogeneously covers the main sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies,
and probes into the regimes of quiescent galaxies and starburst outliers. The data are mostly from
the KMOS^3D survey, with deep, integral field spectroscopy of the Ha, [NII], and [SII] line emission.
About 1/3 of the sample exhibits outflows, roughly equally split into winds driven by star formation
(SF) and by active galactic nuclei (AGN). The incidence of SF-driven winds correlates mainly with
star formation properties. These outflows have a typical velocity of ~450 km/s and local electron
density of n_e ~ 380 cm^-3, leading to modest mass loading factors of ~ 0.1-0.2 at all galaxy masses.
Their energetics are compatible with momentum driving by the young stellar populations. The SF-driven
winds may escape only from log(M*/Msun) < 10.3 galaxies. Faster AGN-driven outflows (~1000-2000
km/s) are detected above log(M*/Msun)~10.7, in up to ~75% of galaxies at log(M*/Msun)>11.2, and
are roughly twice as common as X-ray detected AGN. The incidence, strength, and velocity of AGN-driven
winds strongly correlates with stellar mass and central concentration. Their outflowing ionized
gas appears to be denser (n_e ~ 1000 cm^-3), and possibly compressed and shock-excited by hotter
wind fluid. These winds have comparable inferred mass loading factors as the SF-driven winds but
carry roughly 10 times more momentum and 50 times more energy. The results robustly confirm our previous
findings of high duty cycle, energy-driven outflows powered by AGN above the Schechter mass, which
may contribute to quench star formation in high mass galaxies at the peak epoch of galaxy formation.
