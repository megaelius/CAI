Hubble Space Telescope spectroscopic observations of the nearby type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2011fe,
taken on 10 epochs from -13.5 to +41 days relative to B-band maximum light, and spanning the far-ultraviolet
(UV) to the near-infrared (IR) are presented. This spectroscopic coverage makes SN 2011fe the best-studied
local SN Ia to date. SN 2011fe is a typical moderately-luminous SN Ia with no evidence for dust extinction.
Its near-UV spectral properties are representative of a larger sample of local events studied in
Maguire et al. (2012). As a result, conclusions inferred from our detailed investigations are likely
representative of those for other normal SNe Ia. The near-UV to optical spectra of SN 2011fe are modelled
with a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code using the technique of 'abundance tomography', providing
tight constraints on the density structure and abundance stratification of the event. SN 2011fe
was a relatively weak explosion, with moderate Fe-group yields. Although its density structure
is close to the 'standard' SN Ia pure deflagration explosion model W7, an improved model was developed
which demonstrates that the ejecta of SN 2011fe have a more pronounced high-velocity tail, typical
of a detonation wave affecting the outer layers. This improved model has a lower energy than typical
delayed-detonation models. The derived Fe abundance in the outermost layer is consistent with
the metallicity of ~0.5 solar at the SN explosion site in M101. Importantly, the spectroscopic rise
time of ~19 days is significantly longer than that measured from the early optical light curve, implying
a 'dark phase' of ~1-1.5 days. Such an extension in the rise time has significant implications when
deducing the properties of the white dwarf and binary system from the early photometric behaviour.
