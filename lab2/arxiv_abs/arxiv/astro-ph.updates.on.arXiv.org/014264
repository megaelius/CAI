Recent observational advances have enabled high resolution mapping of ${^{44}}$Ti in core-collapse
supernova (CCSN) remnants. Comparisons between observations and models provide stringent constraints
on the CCSN mechanism. However, past work has identified several uncertain nuclear reaction rates
that influence ${^{44}}$Ti and ${^{56}}$Ni production in post-processing model calculations.
We evolved one dimensional models of $15~M_{\odot}$, $18~M_{\odot}$, $22~M_{\odot}$ and $25~M_{\odot}$
stars from zero-age main sequence through CCSN using {\tt MESA} (Modules for Experiments in Stellar
Astrophysics) and investigated the previously identified reaction rate sensitivities of ${^{44}}$Ti
and ${^{56}}$Ni production. We tested the robustness of our results by making various assumptions
about the CCSN explosion energy and mass-cut. We found a number of reactions that have a significant
impact on the nucleosynthesis of ${^{44}}$Ti and ${^{56}}$Ni, particularly for lower progenitor
masses. Notably, the reaction rates $^{13}{\rm N}(\alpha,p)^{16}{\rm O}$, $^{17}{\rm F}(\alpha,p)^{20}{\rm
Ne}$, $^{52}{\rm Fe}(\alpha,p)^{55}{\rm Co}$, $^{56}{\rm Ni}(\alpha,p)^{59}{\rm Cu}$, $^{57}{\rm
Ni}(n,p)^{57}{\rm Co}$, $^{56}{\rm Co}(p,n)^{56}{\rm Ni}$, $^{39}{\rm K}(p,\gamma)^{40}{\rm
Ca}$, $^{47}{\rm V}(p,\gamma)^{48}{\rm Cr}$, $^{52}{\rm Mn}(p,\gamma)^{53}{\rm Fe}$, $^{57}{\rm
Co}(p,\gamma)^{58}{\rm Ni}$, and $^{39}{\rm K}(p,\alpha)^{36}{\rm Ar}$ are influential for
a large number of model conditions. Furthermore, we found the list of influential reactions identified
by previous post-processing studies of CCSN shock-driven nucleosynthesis is likely incomplete,
motivating future larger-scale sensitivity studies.
