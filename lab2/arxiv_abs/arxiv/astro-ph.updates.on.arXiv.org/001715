We investigate the potential of large X-ray selected AGN samples for detecting baryonic acoustic
oscillations (BAO). Though AGN selection in X-ray band is very clean and efficient, it does not provide
us redshift information, and thus needs to be complemented with an optical follow-up. The main focus
of this study is: (i) to find necessary requirements to the quality of the optical follow-up and (ii)
to formulate the optimal strategy of the X-ray survey, in order to detect the BAO. We demonstrate
that redshift accuracy of sigma_0=10^{-2} and the catastrophic failure rate of <~30% are sufficient
for a reliable detection of BAO in future X-ray surveys. Spectroscopic quality redshifts combined
with negligible fraction of catastrophic failures will boost the confidence level of the BAO detection
by a factor of ~2. For the meaningful detection of BAO, X-ray surveys of moderate depth of F_lim ~ few
10^{-15} erg/s/cm^2 covering sky area from a ~few hundred to ~ten thousand square degrees are required.
The optimal strategy for the BAO detection does not necessarily require full sky coverage. For example,
in a 1000 days long survey by an eROSITA type telescope, an optimal strategy would be to survey a sky
area of ~9000 deg^2, yielding a ~16 sigma BAO detection. A similar detection will be achieved by ATHENA+
or WFXT class telescopes in a survey with a duration of 100 days, covering similar sky area. XMM-Newton
can achieve a marginal BAO detection in a 100 days survey covering ~400 deg^2. These surveys would
demand a moderate to high cost in terms the optical follow-ups, requiring determination of redshifts
of ~10^5 (XMM-Newton) to ~3x10^6 objects (eROSITA, ATHENA+ and WFXT) in the above mentioned sky
areas.
