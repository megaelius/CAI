Aims. We present the B-, V- and K-band surface photometry catalogs obtained running the automatic
software GASPHOT on galaxies from the WINGS cluster survey having isophotal area larger than 200
pixels. The catalogs can be downloaded at the Centre de Donnees Astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS).
Methods. We outline the GASPHOT performances and compare our surface photometry with that obtained
by SExtractor, GALFIT and GIM2D. This analysis is aimed at providing statistical information about
the accuracy generally achieved by the softwares for automatic surface photometry of galaxies.
Results. For each galaxy and for each photometric band the GASPHOT catalogs provide the parameters
of the Sersic law best-fitting the luminosity profiles. They are: the sky coordinates of the galaxy
center (R:A:; DEC:), the total magnitude (m), the semi-major axis of the effective isophote (Re),
the Sersic index (n), the axis ratio (b=a) and a flag parameter (QFLAG) giving a global indication
of the fit quality. The WINGS-GASPHOT database includes 41,463 galaxies in the B-band, 42,275 in
the V-band, and 71,687 in the K-band. We find that the bright early-type galaxies have larger Sersic
indices and effective radii, as well as redder colors in their center. In general the effective radii
increase systematically from the K- to the V- and B-band. Conclusions. The GASPHOT photometry turns
out to be in fairly good agreement with the surface photometry obtained by GALFIT and GIM2D, as well
as with the aperture photometry provided by SExtractor. The main advantages of GASPHOT with respect
to other tools are: (i) the automatic finding of the local PSF; (ii) the short CPU time of execution;
(iii) the remarkable stability against the choice of the initial guess parameters. All these characteristics
make GASPHOT an ideal tool for blind surface photometry of large galaxy samples in wide-field CCD
mosaics.
