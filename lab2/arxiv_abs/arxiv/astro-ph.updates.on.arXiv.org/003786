Thanks to its high spectral resolution (~5 eV at 6 keV), the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) on board
Hitomi enables us to measure the detailed structure of spatially resolved emission lines from highly
ionized ions in galaxy clusters for the first time. In this series of papers, using the SXS we have
measured the velocities of gas motions, metallicities and the multi-temperature structure of
the gas in the core of the Perseus cluster. Here, we show that when inferring physical properties
from line emissivities in systems like Perseus, the resonant scattering (RS) effect should be taken
into account. In the Hitomi waveband, RS mostly affects the FeXXV He$\alpha$ line ($w$) - the strongest
line in the spectrum. The flux measured by Hitomi in this line is suppressed by a factor ~1.3 in the
inner ~30 kpc, compared to predictions for an optically thin plasma; the suppression decreases
with the distance from the center. The $w$ line also appears slightly broader than other lines from
the same ion. The observed distortions of the $w$ line flux, shape and distance dependence are all
consistent with the expected effect of the resonant scattering in the Perseus core. By measuring
the ratio of fluxes in optically thick ($w$) and thin (FeXXV forbidden, He$\beta$, Ly$\alpha$)
lines, and comparing these ratios with predictions from Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations,
the velocities of gas motions have been obtained. The results are consistent with the direct measurements
of gas velocities from line broadening described elsewhere in this series, although the systematic
and statistical uncertainties remain significant. Further improvements in the predictions of
line emissivities in plasma models, and deeper observations with future X-ray missions will enable
RS measurements to provide powerful constraints on the amplitude and anisotropy of clusters gas
motions.
