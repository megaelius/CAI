The high-mass X-ray binary SMC X-1 is an eclipsing binary with an orbital period of 3.89 d. This system
exhibits a superorbital modulation with a period varying between ~40 d and ~65 d. The instantaneous
frequency and the corresponding phase of the superorbital modulation can be obtained by a recently
developed time-frequency analysis technique, the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). We present
a phase-resolved analysis of both the spectra and the orbital profiles with the superorbital phase
derived from the HHT. The X-ray spectra observed by the Proportional Counter Array onboard the Rossi
X-ray Timing Explorer are fitted well by a blackbody plus a Comptonized component. The plasma optical
depth, which is a good indicator of the distribution of material along the line of sight, is significantly
anti-correlated with the flux detected at 2.5-25 keV. However, the relationship between the plasma
optical depth and the equivalent width of the iron line is not monotonic: there is no significant
correlation for fluxes higher than ~35 mCrab but clear positive correlation when the intensity
is lower than ~20 mCrab. This indicates that the iron line production is dominated by different regions
of this binary system in different superorbital phases. To study the dependence of the orbital profile
on the superorbital phase, we obtained the eclipse profiles by folding the All Sky Monitor light
curve with the orbital period for different superorbital states. A dip feature, similar to the pre-eclipse
dip in Her X-1, lying at orbital phase ~0.6-0.85, was discovered during the superorbital transition
state. This indicates that the accretion disk has a bulge that absorbs considerable X-ray emission
in the stream-disk interaction region. The dip width is anti-correlated with the flux, and this
relation can be interpreted by the precessing tilted accretion disk scenario.
