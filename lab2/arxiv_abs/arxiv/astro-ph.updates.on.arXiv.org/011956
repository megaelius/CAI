We demonstrate a novel technique for calibrating the energy scale of the XMM EPIC-pn detector, which
allows us to measure bulk flows in the intracluster medium (ICM) of the Perseus and Coma clusters.
The procedure uses the instrumental lines present in all observations, in particular, Cu-Ka. By
studying their spatial and temporal variations, in addition to incorporating calibration observations,
we refined the absolute energy scale to better than 150 km/s at the Fe-K line, a large improvement
over the nominal accuracy of 550 km/s. We then mapped the bulk motions over much of the central 1200
and 800 kpc of Perseus and Coma, respectively, in spatial regions down to 65 and 140 kpc size. We cross-checked
our procedure by comparing our measurements with those found in Perseus by Hitomi for an overlapping
region, finding consistent results. For Perseus, there is a LoS velocity increase of 480+-210 km/s
(1sigma) 250 kpc east of the nucleus. This region is associated with a cold front, providing direct
evidence of the ICM sloshing in the potential well. Assuming the intrinsic distribution of bulk
motions is Gaussian, its width is 214+-85 km/s, excluding systematics. Removing the sloshing region,
this is reduced to 20-150 km/s, which is similar in magnitude to the Hitomi line width measurements
in undisturbed regions. In Coma, the line-of-sight velocity of the ICM varies between the velocities
of the two central galaxies. Maps of the gas velocity and metallicity provide clues about the merger
history of the Coma, with material to the north and east of the cluster core having a velocity similar
to NGC 4874, while that to the south and west has velocities close to NGC 4889. Our results highlight
the difference between a merging system, such as Coma, where we observe a ~1000 km/s range in velocity,
and a relatively relaxed system, such as Perseus, with much weaker bulk motions. [abridged]
