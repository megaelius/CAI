The surface angular velocity evolution of low-mass stars is now globally understood and the main
physical mechanisms involved in it are observationally quite constrained. Additionally, recent
observations showed anomalies in the rotation period distribution of open clusters main sequence
early K-type stars that cannot be reproduced by current angular momentum evolution model. In this
work, we study the parameter space of star-planet system's configurations to investigate if including
the tidal star-planet interaction in angular momentum evolution models could reproduce these
rotation period distribution's anomalies. To study this effect, we use a parametric angular momentum
evolution model that allows for core-envelope decoupling and angular momentum extraction by magnetized
stellar wind that we coupled to an orbital evolution code where we take into account the torque due
to the tides raised on the star by the planet. We explore different stellar and planetary configurations
(stellar mass from 0.5 to 1.0 $\rm M_{\odot}$ and planetary mass from 10 $\rm M_{\oplus}$ to 13 $\rm
M_{\rm jup}$) to study their effect on the planetary orbital and stellar rotational evolution.
The stellar angular momentum is the most impacted by the star-planet interaction when the planet
is engulfed during the early main sequence phase. Thus, if a close-in Jupiter mass planet is initially
located around 50\% of the stellar corotation radius, a kink in the rotational period distribution
opens around late and early K-type stars during the early main sequence phase. Tidal star-planet
interactions can create a kink in the rotation period distribution of low-mass stars, which could
possibly account for unexpected scatter seen in the rotational period distribution of young stellar
clusters.
