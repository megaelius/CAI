Stellar-remnant black holes (BH) in dense stellar clusters comprise a natural setup to trigger
general-relativistic (GR) inspiral and merger of binary black holes (BBH), detectable by the LISA
and the LIGO-Virgo, through dynamical encounters inside such environments. In this work, the intricacies
of such dynamical interactions are probed utilizing realistic, self-consistent, post-Newtonian,
direct N-body evolutionary models of young massive and open stellar clusters. Particularly, the
configurations of the compact subsystems, that drive the in-cluster GR BBH coalescences, are live-tracked.
Such an approach reveals that the GR coalescences within the open clusters take place primarily
via chaotic interactions involving triple BH systems. Although less frequently, such mergers
are found to happen also in higher-order subsystems such as quadruples and in subsystems involving
non-BH members; the mergers can themselves be BH---non-BH, which events would leave electromagnetic
signatures. Close, fly-by encounters inside the clusters can also make BBHs and other types of double-compact
binaries temporarily post-Newtonian; such binaries would potentially contribute to the GW background
for the LISA and the PTA. These calculations, furthermore, suggest that open clusters are potential
hosts for not only detached BH---main-sequence binaries, as recently identified in the globular
cluster NGC 3201, but also a wide variety of other types of remnant---non-remnant binaries, which
are assembled via dynamical interactions inside the clusters and which have the prospects of being
discovered in radial-velocity surveys.
