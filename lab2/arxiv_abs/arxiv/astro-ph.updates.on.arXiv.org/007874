The photon-scattering winds of M-giants absorb parts of the chromospheric emission lines and produce
self-reversed spectral features in high resolution {\it HST}/GHRS spectra. These spectra provide
an opportunity to assess fundamental parameters of the wind, including flow and turbulent velocities,
the optical depth of the wind above the region of photon creation, and the star's mass-loss rate.
This paper is the last paper in the series `GHRS Observations of Cool, Low-Gravity Stars'; the last
several have compared empirical measurements of spectral emission lines with models of the winds
and mass-loss of K-giant and supergiants. We have used the Sobolev with Exact Integration (SEI)
radiative transfer code, along with simple models of the outer atmosphere and wind, to determine
and compare the wind characteristics of the two M-giant stars, $\gamma$~Cru (M3.5III) and $\mu$~Gem
(M3IIIab), with previously derived values for low-gravity K-stars. The analysis specifies the
wind parameters and calculates line profiles for the \ion{Mg}{2} resonance lines, in addition
to a range of unblended \ion{Fe}{2} lines. Our line sample covers a large range of wind opacities
and, therefore, probes a range of heights in the atmosphere. Our results show that $\mu$~Gem has
a slower and more turbulent wind then $\gamma$~Cru. Also, $\mu$~Gem has weaker chromosphere, in
terms of surface flux, with respect to $\gamma$~Cru. This suggests that $\mu$~Gem is more evolved
than $\gamma$~Cru. Comparing the two M-giants in this work with previously studied K-giant and
supergiant stars ($\alpha$~Tau, $\gamma$~Dra, $\lambda$~Vel) reveals that the M-giants have
slower winds than the earlier giants, but exhibit higher mass-loss rates. Our results are interpreted
in the context of the winds being driven by Alfv\'{e}n waves.
