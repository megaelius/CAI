We present a strong-lensing analysis of four massive galaxy clusters imaged with the Hubble Space
Telescope in the Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey. We use a Light-Traces-Mass technique to
uncover sets of multiply images and constrain the mass distribution of the clusters. These mass
models are the first published for Abell S295 and MACS J0159.8-0849, and are improvements over previous
models for Abell 697 and MACS J0025.4-1222. Our analysis for MACS J0025.4-1222 and Abell S295 shows
a bimodal mass distribution supporting the merger scenarios proposed for these clusters. The updated
model for MACS J0025.4-1222 suggests a substantially smaller critical area than previously estimated.
For MACS J0159.8-0849 and Abell 697 we find a single peak and relatively regular morphology, revealing
fairly relaxed clusters. Despite being less prominent lenses, three of these clusters seem to have
lensing strengths, i.e. cumulative area above certain magnification, similar to the Hubble Frontier
Fields clusters (e.g., A($\mu>5$) $\sim 1-3$ arcmin$^2$, A($\mu>10$) $\sim 0.5-1.5$ arcmin$^2$),
which in part can be attributed to their merging configurations. We make our lens models publicly
available through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes. Finally, using Gemini-N/GMOS spectroscopic
observations we detect a single emission line from a high-redshift $J_{125}\simeq25.7$ galaxy
candidate lensed by Abell 697. While we cannot rule out a lower-redshift solution, we interpret
the line as Ly$\alpha$ at $z=5.800\pm 0.001$, in agreement with its photometric redshift and dropout
nature. Within this scenario we measure a Ly$\alpha$ rest-frame equivalent width of $52\pm22$
\AA, and an observed Gaussian width of $117\pm 15$ km/s.
