(arXiv abridged abstract) The observed UV rest-frame spectra of distant galaxies are the result
of their intrinsic emission combined with absorption along the line of sight produced by the inter-galactic
medium (IGM). Here we analyse the evolution of the mean IGM transmission Tr(Ly_alpha) and its dispersion
along the line of sight for 2127 galaxies with 2.5<z<5.5 in the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS).
We fit model spectra combined with a range of IGM transmission to the galaxy spectra using the spectral
fitting algorithm GOSSIP+. We use these fits to derive the mean IGM transmission towards each galaxy
for several redshift slices from z=2.5 to z=5.5. We find that the mean IGM transmission defined as
Tr(Ly_alpha)=e^{-tau} (with tau the HI optical depth) is 79%, 69%, 59%, 55% and 46% at redshifts
2.75, 3,22, 3.70, 4.23, 4.77, respectively. We compare these results to measurements obtained
from quasars lines of sight and find that the IGM transmission towards galaxies is in excellent agreement
with quasar values up to redshift z~4. We find tentative evidence for a higher IGM transmission at
z>= 4 compared to results from QSOs, but a degeneracy between dust extinction and IGM prevents
to draw firm conclusions if the internal dust extinction for star-forming galaxies at z>4 takes
a mean value significantly in excess of E(B-V)>0.15. Most importantly, we find a large dispersion
of IGM transmission along the lines of sight towards distant galaxies with 68% of the distribution
within 10 to 17% of the median value in delta z=0.5 bins, similar to what is found on the LOS towards
QSOs. We demonstrate the importance of taking into account this large range of IGM transmission
when selecting high redshift galaxies based on their colour properties (e.g. LBG or photometric
redshift selection) or otherwise face a significant incompleteness in selecting high redshift
galaxy populations.
