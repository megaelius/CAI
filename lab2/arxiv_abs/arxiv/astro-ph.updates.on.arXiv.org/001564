Here we propose a new gamma-ray burst (GRB) mission, the Next Generation Rapid-Response GRB Observatory
(NGRG). As with Swift, GRBs are initially located with a coded-mask X-ray camera. However, the NGRG
has two new features: First, a beam-steering system to begin optical observations within ~ 1 s after
location; second, a near-IR (NIR) camera viewing the same sky, for sensitivity to extinguished
bursts. These features allow measurement of the rise phase of GRB optical-NIR emission. Thus far,
the rise time and transition between prompt and afterglow in the optical and NIR are rarely measured.
Rapid-response measurements explore many science topics including optical emission mechanisms
(synchrotron vs. SSC, photospheric emission) and jet characteristics (reverse vs. forward shock
emission, baryon-dominated vs. magnetic dominated). Rapid optical-NIR response can measure
dynamic evolution of extinction due to vaporization of dust, and separate star system and galaxy
dust extinction. We discuss these measurements, giving reliable detection rate estimates from
analysis of Swift data and scaled Swift performance. The NGRG will explore optical/NIR emission
measured earlier than ever before, and potentially fainter, more extinguished GRBs than ever before.
In the current era, costs are important. Our proposed modest NGRG can still produce new GRB science,
while providing rapid GRB alerts for the entire community for post-Swift GRB science. We show that
an X-ray instrument barely 1/5 the area of Swift BAT will yield a significant fraction of Swift's
detection rate: more than 65 X-ray, and with a 30 cm optical-IR telescope and modern cameras, more
than 19 NIR and 14 optical detections each year. In addition, active feedback control of the beam-steering
would remove the need for arc sec stabilization of the spacecraft, for a substantial cost saving.
