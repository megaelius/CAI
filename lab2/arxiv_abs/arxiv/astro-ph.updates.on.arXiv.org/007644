Dark energy and dark matter constitute 95% of the observable Universe. Yet the physical nature of
these two phenomena remains a mystery. Einstein suggested a long-forgotten solution: gravitationally
repulsive negative masses, which drive cosmic expansion and cannot coalesce into light-emitting
structures. However, contemporary cosmological results are derived upon the reasonable assumption
that the Universe only contains positive masses. By reconsidering this assumption, I have constructed
a toy model which suggests that both dark phenomena can be unified into a single negative mass fluid.
The model is a modified $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and indicates that continuously-created negative
masses can resemble the cosmological constant and can flatten the rotation curves of galaxies.
The model leads to a cyclic universe with a time-variable Hubble parameter, potentially providing
compatibility with the current tension that is emerging in cosmological measurements. In the first
three-dimensional N-body simulations of negative mass matter in the scientific literature, this
exotic material naturally forms haloes around galaxies that extend to several galactic radii.
These haloes are not cuspy. The proposed cosmological model is therefore able to predict the observed
distribution of dark matter in galaxies from first principles. The model makes several testable
predictions and seems to have the potential to be consistent with observational evidence from distant
supernovae, the cosmic microwave background, and galaxy clusters. These findings may imply that
negative masses are a real and physical aspect of our Universe, or alternatively may imply the existence
of a superseding theory that in some limit can be modelled by effective negative masses. Both cases
lead to the surprising conclusion that the compelling puzzle of the dark Universe may have been due
to a simple sign error.
