We investigate whether the evolution of cluster scaling relations is affected by the spurious evolution
of mass due to the evolving reference density with respect to which halo masses are defined (pseudo-evolution).
We use the relation between mass, M, and velocity dispersion, sigma, as a test case, and find that
the deviation from the M-sigma relation of cluster-sized halos due of pseudo-evolution is smaller
than 10% for a wide range of mass definitions. The reason for this small impact is a tight relation
between the velocity dispersion and mass profiles, sigma(<r) = const * (GM(<r) / r)^(1/2),
which holds across a large radial range. We show that such a relation is generically expected for
a wide range of density profiles, as long as halos are in approximate Jeans equilibrium. Thus, as
the outer "virial" radius used to define the halo mass, R, increases due to pseudo-evolution, halos
approximately preserve their M-sigma relation. This result explains why such relations are almost
insensitive to the definition of the virial radius, and highlights the fact that tight scaling relations
are the result of tight equilibrium relations between radial profiles of physical quantities,
rather than a result of the virial theorem applied to the cluster as a whole within some unique boundary.
We find exceptions at very small and very large radii, where the profiles deviate from the relations
they exhibit at intermediate radii. We discuss the implications of these results for other cluster
scaling relations, and argue that pseudo-evolution should have very small effects on most scaling
relations, except for those which involve the stellar masses of galaxies. In particular, we show
that the relation between stellar mass fraction and total mass is affected by pseudo-evolution,
and is largely shaped by it for halo masses smaller than 1E14 Msun.
