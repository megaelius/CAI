We present the first spatially-resolved rest-frame UV study of the gravitationally lensed galaxy,
the 'Cosmic Horseshoe' (J1148+1930) at z=2.38. Our gravitational lens model shows that the system
is made up of four star-forming regions, each ~4-8 kpc^2 in size, from which we extract four spatially
exclusive regional spectra. We study the interstellar and wind absorption lines, along with CIII]
doublet emission lines, in each region to investigate any variation in emission/absorption line
properties. The mapped CIII] emission shows distinct kinematical structure, with velocity offsets
of ~+/-50 km/s between regions suggestive of a merging system, and a variation in equivalent width
that indicates a change in ionisation parameter and/or metallicity between the regions. Absorption
line velocities reveal a range of outflow strengths, with gas outflowing between -200<v(km/s)<-50
relative to the systemic velocity of that region. Interestingly, the strongest gas outflow appears
to emanate from the most diffuse star-forming region. The star-formation rates remain relatively
constant (~8-16 M_sol/yr), mostly due to large uncertainties in reddening estimates. As such,
the outflows appear to be 'global' rather than 'locally' sourced. We measure electron densities
with a range of log(Ne)=3.92-4.36 cm^-3, and point out that such high densities may be common when
measured using the CIII] doublet due to its large critical density. Overall, our observations demonstrate
that while it is possible to trace variations in large scale gas kinematics, detecting inhomogeneities
in physical gas properties and their effects on the outflowing gas may be more difficult. This study
provides important lessons for the spatially-resolved rest-frame UV studies expected with future
observatories, such as JWST.
