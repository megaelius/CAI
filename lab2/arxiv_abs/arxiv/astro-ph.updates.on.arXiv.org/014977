We report on the first measurement of the astrophysical neutrino flux using particle showers (cascades)
in IceCube data from 2010 -- 2015. Assuming standard oscillations, the astrophysical neutrinos
in this dedicated cascade sample are dominated ($\sim 90 \%$) by electron and tau flavors. The flux,
observed in the sensitive energy range from $16\,\mathrm{TeV}$ to $2.6\,\mathrm{PeV}$, is consistent
with a single power-law model as expected from Fermi-type acceleration of high energy particles
at astrophysical sources. We find the flux spectral index to be $\gamma=2.53\pm0.07$ and a flux
normalization for each neutrino flavor of $\phi_{astro} = 1.66^{+0.25}_{-0.27}$ at $E_{0} = 100\,
\mathrm{TeV}$, in agreement with IceCube's complementary muon neutrino results and with all-neutrino
flavor fit results. In the measured energy range we reject spectral indices $\gamma\leq2.28$ at
$\ge3\sigma$ significance level. Due to high neutrino energy resolution and low atmospheric neutrino
backgrounds, this analysis provides the most detailed characterization of the neutrino flux at
energies below $\sim100\,{\rm{TeV}}$ compared to previous IceCube results. Results from fits
assuming more complex neutrino flux models suggest a flux softening at high energies and a flux hardening
at low energies (p-value $\ge 0.06$). The sizable and smooth flux measured below $\sim 100\,{\rm{TeV}}$
remains a puzzle. In order to not violate the isotropic diffuse gamma-ray background as measured
by the Fermi-LAT, it suggests the existence of astrophysical neutrino sources characterized by
dense environments which are opaque to gamma-rays.
