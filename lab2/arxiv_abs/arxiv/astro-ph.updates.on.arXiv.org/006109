We study the heating of the intergalactic medium (IGM) surrounding high redshift star forming galaxies
due to cosmic rays (CR). We take into account the diffusion of low energy cosmic rays and study the
patchiness of the resulting heating. We discuss the case of IGM heating around a high redshift minihalo
($z\sim 10\hbox{--}20$, M$\sim 10^5\hbox{--}10^7$ M$_\odot$),and put an upper limit on the diffusion
coefficient $D\le 1\times 10^{26}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ for the heating to be inhomogeneous at $z\sim
10$ and $D\le 5\hbox{--}6 \times 10^{26}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ at $z\sim 20$. For typical values of $D$,
our results suggest uniform heating by CR at high redshift, although there are uncertainties in
magnetic field and other CR parameters. We also discuss two cases with continuous star formation,
one in which the star formation rate (SFR) of a galaxy is high enough to make the IGM in the vicinity
photoionized, and another in which the SFR is low enough to keep it neutral but high enough to cause
significant heating by cosmic ray protons. In the neutral case (low SFR), we find that the resulting
heating can make the gas hotter than the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation for $D < 10^{30}$
cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$, within a few kpc of the galaxy, and unlikely to be probed by near future radio observations.
In the case of photoionized IGM (high SFR), the resulting heating of the gas in the vicinity of high
redshift ($z\sim 4)$ galaxies of mass $\ge 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ can suppress gas infall into the galaxy.
At lower redshifts ($z\sim 0$), an SFR of $\sim 1$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ can suppress the infall into
galaxies of mass $\le 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$.
