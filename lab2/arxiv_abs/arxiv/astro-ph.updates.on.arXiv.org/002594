Recent stellar evolution models show consistently that very massive metal-free stars evolve into
red supergiants shortly before they explode. We argue that the envelopes of these stars, which will
form pair-instability supernovae, become pulsationally unstable, and that this will lead to extreme
mass-loss rates even though the metal content of the envelopes is very small. We investigate the
pulsational properties of such models, and derive pulsationally induced mass-loss rates which
take the damping effects of the mass loss on the pulsations selfconsistently into account. We find
that the pulsations may induce mass-loss rates of ~ 1e-4 - 1e-2 Msun/yr shortly before the explosions,
which may create a dense circumstellar medium. Our results show that very massive stars with dense
circumstellar media may originate from a wider initial mass range than that of pulsational-pair
instability supernovae. The extreme mass loss will cease when so much of the hydrogen-rich envelope
is lost that the star becomes more compact and stops pulsating. Therefore, the helium core of these
stars remains unaffected, and their fate as pair-instability supernovae remains unaltered. The
existence of dense circumstellar media around metal-free pair-instability supernovae can make
them brighter and bluer and they may be easier to detect at high redshifts than previously expected.
We argue that the mass-loss enhancement in pair-instability supernova progenitors can naturally
explain some observational properties of superluminous supernovae, namely, the energetic explosions
of stars within hydrogen-rich dense circumstellar media with little 56Ni production and the lack
of a hydrogen-rich envelope in pair-instability supernova candidates with large 56Ni production.
