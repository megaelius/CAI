Downflows at supersonic speeds have been observed in the transition region (TR) above sunspots
for more than three decades. These downflows are often seen in different TR spectral lines above
sunspots. We have performed a statistical investigation of these downflows using a large sample
which was missing earlier. The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) has provided a wealth
of observational data of sunspots at high spatial and spectral resolution in the past few years.
We have identified sixty datasets obtained with IRIS raster scans. Using an automated code, we identified
the locations of strong downflows within these sunspots. We found that around eighty percent of
our sample show supersonic downflows in the Si IV 1403 {\AA} line. These downflows mostly appear
in the penumbral regions, though some of them are found in the umbrae. We also found that almost half
of these downflows show signatures in chromospheric lines. Furthermore, a detailed spectral analysis
was performed by selecting a small spectral window containing the O IV 1400/1401 {\AA} and Si IV 1403
{\AA} lines. Six Gaussian functions were simultaneously fitted to these three spectral lines and
their satellite lines associated with the supersonic downflows. We calculated the intensity,
Doppler velocity and line width for these lines. Using the O IV 1400/1401 {\AA} line ratio, we find
that the downflow components are around one order of magnitude less dense than the regular components.
Results from our statistical analysis suggest that these downflows may originate from the corona
and that they are independent of the background TR plasma.
