Context: Several recent studies have found that planet migration in adiabatic discs differs significantly
from migration in isothermal discs. Depending on the thermodynamic conditions, i.e., the effectiveness
of radiative cooling, and the radial surface density profile, planets migrate inward or outward.
Clearly, this will influence the semimajor axis - mass distribution of planets as predicted by population
synthesis simulations. Aims: Our goal is to study the global effects of radiative cooling, viscous
torque desaturation and gap opening as well as stellar irradiation on the tidal migration of a synthetic
planet population. Methods: We combine results from several analytical studies and 3D hydrodynamic
simulations in a new semi-analytical migration model for the application in our planet population
synthesis calculations. Results: We find a good agreement of our model with torques obtained in
a 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations. We find three convergence zones in a typical disc, towards
which planets migrate from the in- and outside, affecting strongly the migration behavior of low-mass
planets. Interestingly, this leads to slow type II like migration behavior for low-mass planets
captured in those zones even without an ad hoc migration rate reduction factor or a yet to be defined
halting mechanism. This means that the new prescription of migration including non-isothermal
effects makes the preciously widely used artificial migration rate reduction factor obsolete.
Conclusions: Outward migration in parts of a disc makes some planets survive long enough to become
massive. The convergence zones lead to a potentially observable accumulations of low-mass planets
at certain semimajor axes. Our results indicate that further studies of the mass where the corotation
torque saturates will be needed since its value has a major impact on the properties of planet populations.
