We use the moving-mesh code AREPO to investigate the effects of different levels of rotation and
turbulence on the fragmentation of primordial gas and the formation of Population III stars. We
consider 9 different combinations of turbulence and rotation and carry out 5 different realizations
of each setup, yielding one of the largest sets of simulations of Population III star formation ever
performed. We find that fragmentation in Population III star-forming systems is a highly chaotic
process and show that the outcomes of individual realizations of the same initial conditions often
vary significantly. However, some general trends are apparent. Increasing the turbulent energy
promotes fragmentation, while increasing the rotational energy inhibits fragmentation. Within
the 1000 yr period that we simulate, runs including turbulence yield flat protostellar mass functions
while purely rotational runs show a more top-heavy distribution. The masses of the individual protostars
are distributed over a wide range from a few $10^{-3} \, {\rm M_{\odot}}$ to several tens of ${\rm
M_\odot}$. The total mass growth rate of the stellar systems remains high throughout the simulations
and depends only weakly on the degree of rotation and turbulence. Mergers between protostars are
common, but predictions of the merger fraction are highly sensitive to the criterion used to decide
whether two protostars should merge. Previous studies of Population III star formation have often
considered only one realization per set of initial conditions. However, our results demonstrate
that robust trends can only be reliably identified by considering averages over a larger sample
of runs.
