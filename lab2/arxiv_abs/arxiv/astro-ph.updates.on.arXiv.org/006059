It has been suggested that the cycles of activity of X-ray Binaries (XrB) are triggered by a switch
in the dominant disk torque responsible for accretion (paper I). As the disk accretion rate increases,
the disk innermost regions would change from a jet-emitting disk (JED) to a standard accretion disk
(SAD). While JEDs have been proven to successfully reproduce hard states (paper II), the existence
of an outer cold SAD introduces an extra non local cooling term. We investigate the thermal structure
and associated spectra of such a hybrid disk configuration. We use the 2T plasma code elaborated
in paper II, allowing to compute outside-in the disk local thermal equilibrium with self-consistent
advection and optically thin-to-thick transitions, in both radiation and gas supported regimes.
The non-local inverse Compton cooling introduced by the external soft photons is computed by the
BELM code. This additional term has a profound influence on JED solutions, allowing a smooth temperature
transition from the outer SAD to the inner JED. We explore the full parameter space in disk accretion
rate and transition radius, and show that the whole domain in X-ray fluxes and hardness ratios covered
by standard XrB cycles is well reproduced by such hybrid configurations. Precisely, a reasonable
combination of these parameters allows to reproduce the 3-200 keV spectra of five canonical XrB
states. Along with X-ray signatures, JED-SAD configurations also naturally account for the radio
emission whenever it is observed. By varying only the transition radius and the accretion rate,
hybrid disk configurations combining an inner JED and an outer SAD are able to reproduce simultaneously
the X-ray spectral states and radio emission of X-ray binaries during their outburst. Adjusting
these two parameters, it is then possible to reproduce a full cycle. This will be shown in a forthcoming
paper (paper IV).
