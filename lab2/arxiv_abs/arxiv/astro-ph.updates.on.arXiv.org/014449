Glitches are sudden accelerations of the rotation rate $\nu$ of neutron stars, believed to be driven
by the neutron superfluid inside the star's crust and core. They present a wide phenomenology and
their amplitudes $\Delta\nu$ span over six orders of magnitude. The 21 known glitches of the Vela
pulsar are amongst the largest observed (typically $\Delta\nu/\nu\sim10^{-6}$) and have very
similar characteristics. We wish to explore the population of small-amplitude rotational changes
in the Vela pulsar and determine the rate of occurrence and sizes of its smallest glitches. We use
high cadence observations of the Vela pulsar taken between 1981 and 2005 by the Mount Pleasant Radio
Observatory. An automated, systematic search was carried out that investigates whether a significant
change of spin frequency $\nu$ and/or the spin-down rate $\dot{\nu}$ takes place at any given time.
Our study reveals numerous events of all possible signatures (i.e. combinations of $\Delta\nu$
and $\Delta\dot{\nu}$ signs), usually small, with $|\Delta\nu|/\nu<10^{-9}$, which contribute
to Vela's timing noise. We also find two glitches that have not been reported before, with respective
sizes $\Delta\nu/\nu$ of $(5.55\pm0.03)\times10^{-9}$ and $(38\pm4)\times10^{-9}$. The latter
glitch is followed by an exponential-like recovery with characteristic timescale of $\sim30$
d. The Vela pulsar presents an under-abundance of small glitches comparatively to many other glitching
pulsars, which appears genuine and not a result of observational biases. Besides typical glitches,
the smooth spin down of the pulsar is also affected by an almost continuous activity that can be partially
characterised by step-like changes in $\nu$, $\dot{\nu}$ or both.
