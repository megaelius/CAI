Context. Recent metallicity determinations in young open clusters and star-forming regions suggest
that the latter may be characterized by a slightly lower metallicity than the Sun and older clusters
in the solar vicinity. However, these results are based on small statistics and inhomogeneous analyses.
The Gaia-ESO Survey is observing and homogeneously analyzing large samples of stars in several
young clusters and star-forming regions, hence allowing us to further investigate this issue.
Aims. We present a new metallicity determination of the Chamaeleon I star-forming region, based
on the products distributed in the first internal release of the Gaia-ESO Survey. Methods. 48 candidate
members of Chamaeleon I have been observed with the high-resolution spectrograph UVES. We use the
surface gravity, lithium line equivalent width and position in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram
to confirm the cluster members and we use the iron abundance to derive the mean metallicity of the
region. Results. Out of the 48 targets, we confirm 15 high probability members. Considering the
metallicity measurements for 9 of them, we find that the iron abundance of Chamaeleon I is slightly
subsolar with a mean value [Fe/H]=-0.08+/-0.04 dex. This result is in agreement with the metallicity
determination of other nearby star-forming regions and suggests that the chemical pattern of the
youngest stars in the solar neighborhood is indeed more metal-poor than the Sun. We argue that this
evidence may be related to the chemical distribution of the Gould Belt that contains most of the nearby
star-forming regions and young clusters.
