Intrinsic alignments of galaxies have been shown to contaminate weak gravitational lensing observables
on linear scales, r > 10 Mpc/h, but studies of alignments in the non-linear regime have thus far
been inconclusive. We present an estimator for extracting the intrinsic alignment signal of galaxies
around stacked clusters of galaxies from multiband imaging data. Our estimator removes the contamination
caused by galaxies that are gravitationally lensed by the clusters and scattered in redshift space
due to photometric redshift uncertainties. It uses posterior probability distributions for the
redshifts of the galaxies in the sample and it is easily extended to obtain the weak gravitational
lensing signal while removing the intrinsic alignment contamination. We apply this algorithm
to groups and clusters of galaxies identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey `Stripe 82' coadded
imaging data over approximately 150 sq. deg. We find that the intrinsic alignment signal around
stacked clusters in the redshift range 0.1<z<0.4 is consistent with zero. In terms of the
tidal alignment model of Catelan et al. (2001), we set joint constraints on the strength of the alignment
and the bias of the lensing groups and clusters on scales between 0.1 and 10 Mpc/h, $b_LC_1\rho_{\rm
crit} = -2_{-14}^{+14} \times 10^{-4}$. This constrains the contamination fraction of alignment
to lensing signal to the range between [-18,23] per cent below scales of 1 Mpc/h at 95 per cent confidence
level, and this result depends on our photometric redshift quality and selection criteria used
to identify background galaxies. Our results are robust to the choice of photometric band in which
the shapes are measured (i and r) and to centring on the Brightest Cluster Galaxy or on the geometrical
centre of the clusters.
