The habitable zone is the main tool that mission architectures utilize to select potentially habitable
planets for follow up spectroscopic observation. Given its importance, the precise size and location
of the habitable zone remains a hot topic, as many studies, using a hierarchy of models, have assessed
various factors including: atmospheric composition, time, and planetary mass. However, little
work has assessed how the habitable zone changes with variations in background nitrogen pressure,
which is directly connected to the habitability and life bearing potential of planets. Here, I use
an advanced energy balance model with clouds to show that our solar system habitable zone is about
0.9 to 1.7 AU, assuming a 5 bar nitrogen background pressure and a maximum 100 percent cloud cover
at the inner edge. This width is about 20 percent wider than the conservative habitable zone estimate.
Similar extensions are calculated for A to M stars. I also show that cooling clouds and hazes and high
background pressures can decrease the runaway greenhouse threshold temperature to approximately
300 K (or less) for planets orbiting any star type. This is because the associated increase in planetary
albedo enables stable climates closer to the star, where rapid destabilization can be triggered
from a lower mean surface temperature. Enhanced longwave emission for planets with very high stratospheric
temperatures also permits stable climates at smaller orbital distances. The model predicts a runaway
greenhouse above approximately 330 K for planets orbiting the Sun, which is consistent with previous
work. However, moist greenhouses only occur for planets orbiting A-stars.
