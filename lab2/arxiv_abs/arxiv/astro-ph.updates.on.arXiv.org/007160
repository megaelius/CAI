NGC 6791 is a unique stellar cluster, key to our understanding of both the multiple stellar population
phenomenon and the evolution and assembly of the Galaxy. However, despite many investigations,
its nature is still very controversial. Geisler et al. (2012) found evidence suggesting it was the
first open cluster to possess multiple populations but several subsequent studies did not corroborate
this. It has also been considered a member of the thin or thick disk or even the bulge, and both as an
open or globular cluster or even the remnant of a dwarf galaxy. Here, we present and discuss detailed
abundances derived from high resolution spectra obtained with UVES at VLT and HIRES at Keck of 17
evolved stars of this cluster. We obtained a mean [Fe/H]=+0.313+-0.005, in good agreement with
recent estimates, and with no indication of star-to-star metallicity variation, as expected.
We also did not find any variation in Na, in spite of having selected the very same stars as in Geisler
et al. (2012), where a Na variation was claimed. This points to the presence of probable systematics
in the lower resolution spectra of this very high metallicity cluster analysed in that work. In fact,
we find no evidence for an intrinsic spread in any element, corroborating recent independent APOGEE
data. The derived abundances indicate that NGC 6791 very likely formed in the Galactic Bulge and
that the proposed association with the Thick Disk is unlikely, despite its present Galactic location.
We confirm the most recent hypothesis suggesting that the cluster could have formed in the Bulge
and radially migrated to its current location, which appears the best explanation for this intriguing
object.
