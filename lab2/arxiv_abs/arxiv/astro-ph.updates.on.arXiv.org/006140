Using a new, high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulation of a Milky Way-type (MW-type)
galaxy, we explore how a merger-rich assembly history affects the mass budget of the central supermassive
black hole (SMBH). We examine a MW-mass halo at the present epoch whose evolution is characterized
by several major mergers to isolate the importance of merger history on black hole accretion. This
study is an extension of Bellovary et. al. 2013, which analyzed the accretion of high mass, high redshift
galaxies and their central black holes, and found that the gas content of the central black hole reflects
what is accreted by the host galaxy halo. In this study, we find that a merger-rich galaxy will have
a central SMBH preferentially fed by merger gas. Moreover, we find that nearly 30$\%$ of the accreted
mass budget of the SMBH enters the galaxy through the two major mergers in its history, which may account
for the increase of merger-gas fueling the SMBH. Through an investigation of the angular momentum
of the gas entering the host and its SMBH, we determine that merger gas enters the galaxy with lower
angular momentum compared to smooth accretion, partially accounting for the preferential fueling
witnessed in the SMBH. In addition, the presence of mergers, particularly major mergers, also helps
funnel low angular momentum gas more readily to the center of the galaxy. Our results imply that galaxy
mergers play an important role in feeding the SMBH in MW-type galaxies with merger-rich histories.
