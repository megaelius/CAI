We present the discovery of photometric variability in the DQ white dwarf SDSS J103655.39+652252.2
(SDSS J1036+6522). Time-series photometry reveals a coherent monoperiodic modulation at a period
of 1115.6475 1(67) s with an amplitude of 0.442% +/- 0.024%; no other periodic modulations are observed
with amplitudes >~0.13%. The period, amplitude, and phase of this modulation are constant within
errors over 16 months. The spectrum of SDSS J1036+6522 shows magnetic splitting of carbon lines,
and we use Paschen-Back formalism to develop a grid of model atmospheres for mixed carbon and helium
atmospheres. Our models, while reliant on several simplistic assumptions, nevertheless match
the major spectral and photometric properties of the star with a self-consistent set of parameters:
Teff~15,500 K, log g ~9, log(C/He)=-1.0, and a mean magnetic field strength of 3.0 +/- 0.2 MG. The
temperature and abundances strongly suggest that SDSS J1036+6522 is a transition object between
the hot, carbon-dominated DQs and the cool, He-dominated DQs. The variability of SDSS J1036+6522
has characteristics similar to those of the variable hot carbon-atmosphere white dwarfs (DQVs),
however, its temperature is significantly cooler. The pulse profile of SDSS J1036+6522 is nearly
sinusoidal, in contrast with the significantly asymmetric pulse shapes of the known magnetic DQVs.
If the variability in SDSS J1036+6522 is due to the same mechanism as other DQVs, then the pulse shape
is not a definitive diagnostic on the absence of a strong magnetic field in DQVs. It remains unclear
whether the root cause of the variability in SDSS J1036+6522 and the other hot DQVs is the same.
