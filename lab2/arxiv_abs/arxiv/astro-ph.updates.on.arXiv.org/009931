Herbig-Haro (HH) flows exhibit a large variety of morphological and kinematical structures such
as bow shocks, Mach disks, and deflection shocks. Both proper motion (PM) and radial velocity investigations
are essential to understand the physical nature of such structures. We investigate the kinematics
and PM of spectrally separated structures in the FS~Tau~B HH flow. Collating these data makes it
possible to understand the origin of these structures and to explain the unusual behavior of the
jet. On the other hand, the study of emission profiles in the associated reflection nebulae allows
us to consider the source of the outflow both from edge-on and pole-on points of view. We present the
observational results obtained with the 6 m telescope at the Special Astrophysical Observatory
of the Russian Academy of Sciences using the SCORPIO multimode focal reducer with a scanning Fabry-Perot
interferometer. Two epochs of the observations of the FS~Tau~B region in H$\alpha$ emission (2001
and 2012) allowed us to measure the PM of the spectrally separated inner structures of the jet. In
addition to already known emission structures in the FS~Tau~B system, we discover new features
in the extended part of the jet and in the counter-jet. Moreover, we reveal a new HH knot in the HH~276
independent outflow system and point out its presumable source. In the terminal working surface
of the jet, structures with different radial velocities have PMs of the same value. This result can
be interpreted as the direct observation of bow-shock and Mach disk regions. A bar-like structure,
located southwest from the source demonstrates zero PM and can be considered as one more example
of deflection shock. An analysis of H$\alpha$ profiles in the reflection nebulae R1 and R3 indicates
the uniqueness of this object, which can be studied in pole-on and edge-on directions simultaneously.
