We present low-frequency (80-240 MHz) radio imaging of type III solar radio bursts observed by the
Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) on 2015/09/21. The source region for each burst splits from one
dominant component at higher frequencies into two increasingly-separated components at lower
frequencies. For channels below ~132 MHz, the two components repetitively diverge at high speeds
(0.1-0.4 c) along directions tangent to the limb, with each episode lasting just ~2 s. We argue that
both effects result from the strong magnetic field connectivity gradient that the burst-driving
electron beams move into. Persistence mapping of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) jets observed by the
Solar Dynamics Observatory reveals quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) associated with coronal null
points, including separatrix dome, spine, and curtain structures. Electrons are accelerated
at the flare site toward an open QSL, where the beams follow diverging field lines to produce the source
splitting, with larger separations at larger heights (lower frequencies). The splitting motion
within individual frequency bands is interpreted as a projected time-of-flight effect, whereby
electrons traveling along the outer field lines take slightly longer to excite emission at adjacent
positions. Given this interpretation, we estimate an average beam speed of 0.2 c. We also qualitatively
describe the quiescent corona, noting in particular that a disk-center coronal hole transitions
from being dark at higher frequencies to bright at lower frequencies, turning over around 120 MHz.
These observations are compared to synthetic images based on the Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm
outside a Sphere (MAS) model, which we use to flux-calibrate the burst data.
