More than half a million of the 1.69 billion sources in Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) are published with
photometric time series that exhibit light variations during the 22 months of observation. An all-sky
classification of common high-amplitude pulsators (Cepheids, long-period variables, Delta
Scuti / SX Phoenicis, and RR Lyrae stars) is provided for stars with brightness variations greater
than 0.1 mag in G band. A semi-supervised classification approach was employed, firstly training
multi-stage random forest classifiers with sources of known types in the literature, followed
by a preliminary classification of the Gaia data and a second training phase that included a selection
of the first classification results to improve the representation of some classes, before the improved
classifiers were applied to the Gaia data. Dedicated validation classifiers were used to reduce
the level of contamination in the published results. A relevant fraction of objects were not yet
sufficiently sampled for reliable Fourier series decomposition, consequently classifiers were
based on features derived from statistics of photometric time series in the G, BP, and RP bands, as
well as from some astrometric parameters. The published classification results include 195,780
RR Lyrae stars, 150,757 long-period variables, 8550 Cepheids, and 8882 Delta Scuti / SX Phoenicis
stars. All of these results represent candidates whose completeness and contamination are described
as a function of variability type and classification reliability. Results are expressed in terms
of class labels and classification scores, which are available in the vari_classifier_result
table of the Gaia archive.
