We present the results of a multi-frequency, time-averaged analysis of blazars included in the
Candidate Gamma-ray Blazar Survey catalog. Our sample consists of 324 $\gamma$-ray detected ($\gamma$-ray
loud) and 191 non $\gamma$-ray detected ($\gamma$-ray quiet) blazars, and we consider all the data
up to 2016 April 1. We find that both the $\gamma$-ray loud and the $\gamma$-ray quiet blazar populations
occupy similar regions in the WISE color-color diagram, and in the radio and X-ray bands $\gamma$-ray
loud sources are brighter. A simple one-zone synchrotron inverse-Compton emission model is applied
to derive the physical properties of both populations. We find that the central black hole mass and
the accretion disk luminosity ($L_{\rm disk}$) computed from the modeling of the optical-UV emission
with a Shakura-Sunyaev disk reasonably matches with that estimated from the optical spectroscopic
emission-line information. A significantly larger Doppler boosting in the $\gamma$-ray loud
blazars is noted, and their jets are more radiatively efficient. On the other hand, the $\gamma$-ray
quiet objects are more MeV-peaked, thus could be potential targets for next-generation MeV missions.
Our results confirm the earlier findings about the accretion-jet connection in blazars; however,
many of the $\gamma$-ray quiet blazars tend to deviate from the recent claim that the jet power exceeds
$L_{\rm disk}$ in blazars. A broadband study, considering a larger set of $\gamma$-ray quiet objects
and also including BL Lacs, will be needed to confirm/reject this hypothesis and also to verify the
evolution of the powerful high-redshift blazars into their low-power nearby counterparts.
