Flares are powerful events ignited by a sudden release of magnetic energy. With the aim of studying
flares in the 125-Myr-old stars in the Pleiades observed simultaneously in optical and X-ray light,
we obtained new XMM-Newton observations of this cluster during the observations of Kepler K2 Campaign
4. Our objective is to characterize the most powerful flares observed in both bands and to constrain
the energy released in the optical and X-ray, the geometry of the loops, and their time evolution.
We aim to compare our results to existing studies of flares occurring in the Sun and stars at different
ages. We selected bright X-ray/optical flares occurred in 12 known members of the Pleiades from
their K2 and XMM-Newton light curves. The sample includes ten K-M stars, one F9 star, and one G8 star.
Flare average properties were obtained from integrated analysis of the light curves during the
flares. The time evolution of the plasma in the magnetic loops is constrained with time-resolved
X-ray spectral analysis. Most of the flares studied in this work emitted more energy in optical than
in X-rays, as in most solar flares, even if the Pleiades flares output a larger fraction of their total
energy in X-rays than typical solar flares do. Additionally, the energy budget in the two bands is
weakly correlated. We also found comparable flare duration in optical and X-rays and observed that
rapidly rotating stars (e.g., with rotation period shorter than 0.5 days) preferentially host
short flares. We estimated the slope of the cooling path of the flares in the log(EM)-versus-log(T)
plane. The values we obtained are affected by large uncertainties, but their nominal values suggest
that the flares analyzed in this paper are mainly due to single loops with no sustained heating occurring
during the cooling phase. We also observed and analyzed oscillations with a period of 500 s during
one of the flares.
