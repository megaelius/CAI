Context. Stellar shells, which form axially symmetric systems of arcs in some elliptical galaxies,
are most likely remnants of radial minor mergers. They are observed up a radius of $\sim$100 kpc.
The stars in them oscillate in radial orbits. The radius of a shell depends on the free-fall time at
the position of the shell and on the time since the merger. We previously verified the consistency
of shell radii in the elliptical galaxy NGC 3923 with its most probable MOND potential. Our results
implied that an as~yet undiscovered shell exists at the outskirts of the galaxy. Aims. We here extend
our study by assuming more general models for the gravitational potential to verify the prediction
of the new shell and to estimate its position. Methods. We tested the consistency of the shell radial
distribution observed in NGC 3923 with a wide variety of MOND potentials of the galaxy. The potentials
differed in the mass-to-light ratio and in distance to the galaxy. We considered different MOND
interpolation functions, values of the acceleration constant $a_0$, and density profiles of the
galaxy. We verified the functionality of our code on a Newtonian self-consistent simulation of
the formation of a shell galaxy. Results. Our method reliably predicts that exactly one new outermost
shell exists at a galactocentric radius of about 1900$^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim$210 kpc) on the
southwestern side of the galaxy. Its estimated surface brightness is about 28 mag arcsec$^{-2}$
in $B$ - a value accessible by current instruments. This prediction enables a rare test of MOND in
an elliptical down to an acceleration of $a_0/10$. The predictive power of our method is verified
by reconstructing the position of the largest known shell from the distribution of the remaining
shells.
