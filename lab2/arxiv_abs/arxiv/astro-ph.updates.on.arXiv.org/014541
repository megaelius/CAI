Cosmological N-body simulations represent an excellent tool to study the formation and evolution
of dark matter (DM) halos and the mechanisms that have originated the universal profile at the largest
mass scales in the Universe. In particular, the combination of the velocity dispersion $\sigma_\mathrm{v}$
with the density $\rho$ can be used to define the pseudo-entropy $S(r)=\sigma_\mathrm{v}^2/\rho^{2/3}$,
whose profile is well-described by a simple power-law $S\propto r^{\alpha}$. We analyze a set of
cosmological hydrodynamical re-simulations of massive galaxy clusters and study the pseudo-entropy
profiles as traced by different collisionless components in simulated galaxy clusters: DM, stars,
and substructures. We analyze four sets of simulations, exploring different resolution and physics
(N-body and full hydrodynamical simulations) to investigate convergence and the impact of baryons.
We find that baryons significantly affect the inner region of pseudo-entropy profile as traced
by substructures, while pseudo-entropy profiles as traced by DM particles are characterized by
an almost universal behavior and can be used as a low-scatter ($\sim6-7\%$) mass-proxy. We compare
observed and simulated pseudo-entropy profiles and find good agreement in both normalization
and slope. We demonstrate, however, that the method used to derive observed pseudo-entropy profiles
could introduce biases and underestimate the impact of mergers. Finally, we investigate the pseudo-entropy
traced by the stars focusing our interest in the dynamical distinction between intracluster light
(ICL) and the stars bound to the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG): the combination of these two pseudo-entropy
profiles is well-described by a single power-law out to almost the entire cluster virial radius.
