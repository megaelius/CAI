Current attention on interstellar probes for near-term exploration of nearby star systems is focused
on low-mass probes that can be accelerated to relativistic speed using propulsion from a ground-based
DE beam. We consider the design of an optical communication downlink for the return of scientific
data from such a probe at the distance of Proxima Centauri. The conditions under which background
radiation can be neglected are quantified, and the design operates within that regime. Direct-detection
is preferable to heterodyne, and in that context the transmitter should attain high peak-to-average
transmitted power ratios. Based on available electric power sources, the downlink is expected
to operate for years or even decades following target encounter, combined with low data rates. There
are several areas in which technology innovations are needed, most of them related to Earth-based
large-area aperture receiver design with direct detection. A major issue is the choice of multiplexing
approach to support multiple probe downlinks and related challenges. Due to the interaction of
trajectory parallax effects with field-of-view, we conclude that aperture synthesis with controlled
optical beam forming may be required to reject radiation from the target star. Short visible wavelengths
for laser communications are also highly advantageous in reducing that radiation. Highly selective
optical bandpass filtering is needed to reject unnecessary background radiation, and a short-term
data uplink is required to configure the transmit wavelength for variations in probe speed. Fundamental
limits on the photon efficiency are compared to a concrete modulation/coding design in the presence
of weather-based outages.
