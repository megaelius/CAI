Converging networks of interstellar filaments i.e. hubs, have been recently linked to the formation
of stellar clusters and massive stars. The goal is to study the kinematic and density structure of
the SDC13 hub at high angular resolution to determine what drives its evolution and fragmentation.
We have mapped SDC13, a 1000Msun infrared dark hub, in NH3(1,1) and NH3(2,2) emission lines, with
both the JVLA and GBT down to 0.07pc. The mass-per-unit-lengths of all four hub filaments are thermally
super-critical, consistent with the presence of tens of gravitationally bound cores along them.
These cores exhibit regular separation of 0.37 +/- 0.16 pc suggesting gravitational instabilities
running along these super-critical filaments are responsible for their fragmentation. The observed
local increase of the dense gas velocity dispersion towards starless cores is believed to be a consequence
of such fragmentation process. We see velocity gradient peaks towards 63% of the cores as expected
during the early stages of filament fragmentation. The most massive cores are located at the filament
junctions, where the velocity dispersion is the largest. We interpret this as the result of the hub
morphology generating the largest acceleration gradients near the hub centre. We propose a scenario
for the evolution of the SDC13 hub in which filaments first form as post-shock structures in a supersonic
turbulent flow. Then gravity takes over and starts shaping the evolution of the hub, both fragmenting
filaments and pulling the gas towards the centre of the gravitational well. By doing so, gravitational
energy is converted into kinetic energy in both local (cores) and global (hub centre) potential
well minima. Furthermore, the generation of larger gravitational acceleration gradients at the
filament junctions promotes the formation of more massive cores. [abridged]
