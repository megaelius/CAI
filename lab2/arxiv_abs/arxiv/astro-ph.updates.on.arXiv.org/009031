We use the full-sky ray-tracing weak lensing simulations to generate 2268 mock catalogues for the
Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey first-year shear catalogue. Our mock catalogues take into
account various effects as in the real data: the survey footprints, inhomogeneous angular distribution
of source galaxies, statistical uncertainties in photometric redshift (photo-$z$) estimate,
variations in the lensing weight, and the statistical noise in galaxy shape measurements including
both intrinsic shapes and the measurement errors. We then utilize our mock catalogues to evaluate
statistical uncertainties expected in measurements of cosmic shear two-point correlations $\xi_{\pm}$
with tomographic redshift information for the HSC survey. We develop a quasi-analytical formula
for the Gaussian sample variance properly taking into account the number of source pairs in the survey
footprints. The standard Gaussian formula significantly overestimates or underestimates the
mock results by $50\%$ level. We also show that different photo-$z$ catalogues or the six disconnected
fields, rather than a consecutive geometry, cause variations in the covariance by $\sim 5\%$. The
mock catalogues enable us to study the chi-square distribution for $\xi_{\pm}$. We find the wider
distribution than that naively expected for the distribution with the degrees-of-freedom of data
vector used. Finally, we propose a method to include non-zero multiplicative bias in mock shape
catalogue and show the non-zero multiplicative bias can change the effective shape noise in cosmic
shear analyses. Our results suggest an importance of estimating an accurate form of the likelihood
function (and therefore the covariance) for robust cosmological parameter inference from the
precise measurements.
