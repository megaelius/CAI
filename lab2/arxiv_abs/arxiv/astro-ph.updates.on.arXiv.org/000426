We study the effects of optically thin radiative cooling on the structure of radiatively inefficient
accretion flows (RIAFs). The flow structure is geometrically thick, and independent of the gas
density and cooling, if the cooling time is longer than the viscous timescale (i.e., $t_{\rm cool}
\gtrsim t_{\rm visc}$). For higher densities, the gas can cool before it can accrete and forms the
standard geometrically thin, optically thick Shakura-Sunyaev disk. For usual cooling processes
(such as bremsstrahlung), we expect an inner hot flow and an outer thin disk. For a short cooling time
the accretion flow separates into two phases: a radiatively inefficient hot coronal phase and a
cold thin disk. We argue that there is an upper limit on the density of the hot corona corresponding
to a critical value of $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff} (\sim 10-100)$, the ratio of the cooling time and
the free-fall time. Based on our simulations, we have developed a model for observed transients
in black hole X-ray binaries (XRBs). An XRB in a quiescent hot RIAF state can transition to a cold black-body
dominated state because of an increase in the mass accretion rate. The transition from a thin disk
to a RIAF happens because of mass exhaustion due to accretion; the transition happens when the cooling
time becomes longer than the viscous time at inner radii. Since the viscous timescale for a geometrically
thin disk is quite long, the high-soft state is expected to be long-lived. The different timescales
in black hole transients correspond to different physical processes such as viscous evolution,
cooling, and free-fall. Our model captures the overall features of observed state transitions
in XRBs.
