NGC 3105 is a young open cluster hosting blue, yellow and red supergiants. This rare combination
makes it an excellent laboratory to constrain evolutionary models of high-mass stars. It is poorly
studied and fundamental parameters such as its age or distance are not well defined. We intend to
characterize in an accurate way the cluster as well as its evolved stars, for which we derive for the
first time atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances. We identify 126 B-type likely members
within a radius of 2.7$\pm$0.6 arcmin, which implies an initial mass, $M_{cl}\approx$4100 M$_{\odot}$.
We find a distance of 7.2$\pm$0.7 kpc for NGC 3105, placing it at $R_{GC}$=10.0$\pm$1.2 kpc. Isochrone
fitting supports an age of 28$\pm$6 Ma, implying masses around 9.5 M$_{\odot}$ for the supergiants.
A high fraction of Be stars ($\approx$25 %) is found at the top of the main sequence down to spectral
type b3. From the spectral analysis we estimate for the cluster a $v_{rad}$=+46.9$\pm$0.9 km s$^{-1}$
and a low metallicity, [Fe/H]=-0.29$\pm$0.22. We also have determined, for the first time, chemical
abundances for Li, O, Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Ni, Rb, Y, and Ba for the evolved stars. The chemical composition
of the cluster is consistent with that of the Galactic thin disc. An overabundance of Ba is found,
supporting the enhanced $s$-process. NGC 3105 has a low metallicity for its Galactocentric distance,
comparable to typical LMC stars. It is a valuable spiral tracer in a very distant region of the Carina-Sagittarius
spiral arm, a poorly known part of the Galaxy. As one of the few Galactic clusters containing blue,
yellow and red supergiants, it is massive enough to serve as a testbed for theoretical evolutionary
models close to the boundary between intermediate and high-mass stars.
