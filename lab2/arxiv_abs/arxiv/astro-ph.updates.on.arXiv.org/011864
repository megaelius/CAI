We use a sample of galaxies with high-quality rotation curves to assess the role of the luminous component
("baryons") in the dwarf galaxy rotation curve diversity problem. As in earlier work, we find that
the shape of the rotation curve correlates with baryonic surface density; high surface density
galaxies have rapidly-rising rotation curves consistent with cuspy cold dark matter halos, slowly-rising
rotation curves (characteristic of galaxies with inner mass deficits or "cores") occur only in
low surface density galaxies. The correlation, however, seems too weak in the dwarf galaxy regime
to be the main driver of the diversity. In particular, the observed dwarf galaxy sample includes
"cuspy" systems where baryons are unimportant in the inner regions and "cored" galaxies where baryons
actually dominate the inner mass budget. These features are important diagnostics of the viability
of various scenarios proposed to explain the diversity, such as (i) baryonic inflows and outflows;
(ii) dark matter self-interactions (SIDM); (iii) variations in the baryonic acceleration through
the "mass discrepancy-acceleration relation" (MDAR); or (iv) non-circular motions in gaseous
discs. A reanalysis of existing data shows that MDAR does not hold in the inner regions of dwarf galaxies
and thus cannot explain the diversity. Together with analytical modeling and cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations, our analysis shows that each of the remaining scenarios has promising features, but
none seems to fully account for the observed diversity. The origin of the dwarf galaxy rotation curve
diversity and its relation to the small structure of cold dark matter remains an open issue.
