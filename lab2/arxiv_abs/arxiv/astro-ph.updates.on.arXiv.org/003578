The determination of the resolution of cosmological N-body simulations, i.e., the range of scales
in which quantities measured in them represent accurately the continuum limit, is an important
open question. We address it here using scale-free models, for which self-similarity provides
a powerful tool to control resolution. Such models also provide a robust testing ground for the so-called
stable clustering approximation, which gives simple predictions for them. Studying large N-body
simulations of such models with different force smoothing, we find that these two issues are in fact
very closely related: our conclusion is that the accuracy of two point statistics in the non-linear
regime starts to degrade strongly around the scale at which their behaviour deviates from that predicted
by the stable clustering hypothesis. Physically the association of the two scales is in fact simple
to understand: stable clustering fails to be a good approximation when there are strong interactions
of structures (in particular merging) and it is precisely such non-linear processes which are sensitive
to fluctuations at the smaller scales affected by discretisation. Resolution may be further degraded
if the short distance gravitational smoothing scale is larger than the scale to which stable clustering
can propagate. We examine in detail the very different conclusions of studies by Smith et al. (2003)
and Widrow et al. (2009} and find that the strong deviations from stable clustering reported by these
works are the results of over-optimistic assumptions about scales resolved accurately by the measured
power spectra, and the reliance on Fourier space analysis. We emphasise the much poorer resolution
obtained with the power spectrum compared to the two point correlation function..
