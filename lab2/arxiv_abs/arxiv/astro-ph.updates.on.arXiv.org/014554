We want to understand the global observable consequences of different physical processes and the
initial system properties on the demographics of the planetary population. We select distributions
of initial conditions that are representative of known protoplanetary discs and we use the Bern
model to synthesise five planetary populations around 1 Sun-mass stars. Each population has a different
initial number of Moon-mass embryos per disc to test for convergence: 1, 10, 20, 50, and 100. The last
one is our nominal planetary population. The properties of giant planets do not change much starting
with 10 embryos per system. For terrestrial planets inside 1 au, only the 100-embryos population
is able to attain the giant-impact stage. In that population, each system contains 8 planets larger
than 1 $M_\oplus$ on average. The fraction of systems with giants planets at all orbital distances
is 18%, but only 1.6% are at > 10 au. Systems with giants contain on average 1.6 such planets. Inside
of 1 au, the planet type with the highest occurrence rate and multiplicity are super-Earths (2.4
and 3.7), followed by terrestrial planets (1.6 and 2.8). Their frequency peaks at a stellar [Fe/H]
of 0.0 and -0.2 respectively. The frequency of more massive planet types (Neptunian, giants) increases
monotonically with [Fe/H]. Low-mass planets in the habitable zone are found around 44% of the stars
with a multiplicity of 1.3, with a mean [Fe/H] of -0.11. This is one of the most comprehensive simulations
of planetary system formation and evolution to date. For observations, the syntheses provide a
large data set to search for comparison synthetic systems that show how they formed. For theory,
they provide the framework to observationally test the consequences of specific physical processes.
This is a important ingredient towards the development of a standard model of planetary formation
and evolution.
