We aim to explore the variable photometric and stellar properties of four yellow hypergiants (YHGs),
HR8752, HR 5171A, $\rho$ Cas, and HD 179821, and their pulsations of hundreds of days, and long-term
variations (LTVs) of years. We tackled multi-colour and visual photometric data sets, looked for
photometric indications betraying eruptions or enhanced mass-loss episodes, calculated stellar
properties mainly using a published temperature calibration, and investigated the nature of LTVs
and their influence on quasi-periods and stellar properties. The $BV$ photometry revealed a high-opacity
layer in the atmospheres. When the temperature rises the mass loss increases as well, consequently,
as the density of the high-opacity layer. As a result, the absorption in $B$ and $V$ grow. The absorption
in $B$, presumably of the order of one to a few 0\fm1, is always higher than in $V$. This difference
renders redder and variable $(B-V)$ colour indexes, but the absorption law is unknown. This property
of YHGs is unpredictable and explains why spectroscopic temperatures are always higher than photometric
ones. We propose shorter distances for $\rho$ Cas and HR 5171A than the accepted ones. Therefore,
a correction to decrease the blue luminescence of HR 5171A by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
molecules is necessary, and HR 5171A would no longer be a member of the cluster Gum48d. HR 5171A is
only subject to one source of light variation, not by two as the literature suggests. Eruptive episodes
of YHGs prefer relatively cool circumstances when a red evolutionary loop (RL) has shifted the star
to the red on the HR diagram. After the eruption, a blue loop evolution (BL) is triggered lasting one
to a few decades. The reddening episode of HR 5171A between 1960 and 1974 was most likely due to a red
loop evolution, and the reddening after the 1975 eruption was likely due to a shell ejection.
