We study the dependence of galaxy clustering on atomic gas mass using a sample of $\sim$16,000 galaxies
with redshift in the range of $0.0025<z<0.05$ and HI mass of $M_{\rm HI}>10^8M_{\odot}$, drawn
from the 70% complete sample of the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey. We construct subsamples of galaxies
with $M_{\rm HI}$ above different thresholds, and make volume-limited clustering measurements
in terms of three statistics: the projected two-point correlation function, the projected cross-correlation
function with respect to a reference sample selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the redshift-space
monopole moment. In contrast to previous studies, which found no/weak HI-mass dependence, we find
both the clustering amplitude on scales above a few Mpc and the bias factors to increase significantly
with increasing HI mass for subsamples with HI mass thresholds above $10^9M_{\odot}$. For HI mass
thresholds below $10^9M_{\odot}$, while the measurements have large uncertainties caused by
the limited survey volume and sample size, the inferred galaxy bias factors are systematically
lower than the minimum halo bias factor from mass-selected halo samples. The simple halo model,
in which galaxy content is only determined by halo mass, has difficulties in interpreting the clustering
measurements of the HI-selected samples. We extend the simple model by including the halo formation
time as an additional parameter. A model that puts HI-rich galaxies into halos that formed late can
reproduce the clustering measurements reasonably well. We present the implications of our best-fitting
model on the correlation of HI mass with halo mass and formation time, as well as the halo occupation
distributions and HI mass functions for central and satellite galaxies. These results are compared
with the predictions from semi-analytic galaxy formation models and hydrodynamic galaxy formation
simulations.
