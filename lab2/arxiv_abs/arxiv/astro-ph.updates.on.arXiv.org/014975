Throughout this paper we present a new method to detect and measure emission lines in J-PAS up to $z
= 0.35$. J-PAS will observe $8000$~deg$^2$ of the northern sky in the upcoming years with 56 photometric
bands. The release of such amount of data brings us the opportunity to employ machine learning methods
in order to overcome the difficulties associated with photometric data. We used Artificial Neural
Networks (ANNs) trained and tested with synthetic J-PAS photometry from CALIFA, MaNGA, and SDSS
spectra. We carry out two tasks: firstly, we cluster galaxies in two groups according to the values
of the equivalent width (EW) of $H\alpha$, $H\beta$, $[NII]{\lambda 6584}$, and $ [OIII]{\lambda
5007}$ lines measured in the spectra. Then, we train an ANN to assign to each galaxy a group. We are
able to classify them with the uncertainties typical of the photometric redshift measurable in
J-PAS. Secondly, we utilize another ANN to determine the values of those EWs. Subsequently, we obtain
the $[NII]/H\alpha$, $[OIII]/H\beta$, and \ion{O}{3}\ion{N}{2} ratios recovering the BPT diagram
. We study the performance of the ANN in two training samples: one is only composed of synthetic J-PAS
photo-spectra (J-spectra) from MaNGA and CALIFA (CALMa set) and the other one is composed of SDSS
galaxies. We can reproduce properly the main sequence of star forming galaxies from the determination
of the EWs. With the CALMa training set we reach a precision of 0.101 and 0.091 dex for the $[NII]/H\alpha$
and $[OIII]/H\beta$ ratios in the SDSS testing sample. Nevertheless, we find an underestimation
of those ratios at high values in galaxies hosting an AGN. We also show the importance of the dataset
used for both training and testing the model. ANNs are extremely useful to overcome the limitations
previously expected concerning the detection and measurements of the emission lines in surveys
like J-PAS.
