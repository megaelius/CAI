We present the large-scale clustering of emission line galaxies (ELG) from the Data Release 16 of
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. The ELG sample
contains 173,736 galaxies covering 1,170 square degrees in the redshift range $0.6 < z < 1.1$. We
perform a BAO measurement from the post-reconstruction power spectrum monopole, and study redshift
space distortions (RSD) in the first three multipoles. Purely angular photometric systematics
are mitigated by nulling angular signal in pixels of appropriate size. Variations of the redshift
distribution with photometric conditions are accounted for by splitting and measuring the radial
selection function of the survey in regions of homogeneous imaging. Both techniques result in integral
constraints which we model consistently. At the effective redshift $z_{\rm eff} = 0.845$ we measure
$D_{\rm V}(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm drag} = 18.33_{-0.62}^{+0.57}$, with $D_{\rm V}$ the volume averaged
distance and $r_{\rm drag}$ the comoving sound horizon at the drag epoch. In combination with the
RSD measurement, at $z_{\rm eff} = 0.85$ we find $f\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff}) = 0.289_{-0.096}^{+0.085}$,
with $f$ the growth rate of structure and $\sigma_8$ the normalisation of the linear power spectrum,
$D_{\rm H}(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm drag} = 20.0_{-2.2}^{+2.4}$ and $D_{\rm M}(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm
drag} = 19.17 \pm 0.99$ with $D_{\rm H}$ and $D_{\rm M}$ the Hubble and comoving angular distances,
respectively. Quoted errors include statistical and systematic contributions. We find good agreement
with the results obtained in configuration space, thus allowing a consensus measurement of $f\sigma_8(z_{\rm
eff}) = 0.315 \pm 0.95$, $D_{\rm H}(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm drag} = 19.6_{-2.1}^{+2.2}$ and $D_{\rm
M}(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm drag} = 19.5 \pm 1.0$. This measurement is in agreement with a flat $\Lambda$CDM
model with Planck parameters.
