We investigate the nature of the double color-magnitude sequence observed in the Gaia~DR2 HR diagram
of stars with high transverse velocities. The stars in the reddest-color sequence are likely dominated
by the dynamically-hot tail of the thick disk population. Information from Nissen & Schuster (2010)
for some of the stars along the color-magnitude sequence suggests that stars in the blue-color sequence
have elemental abundance patterns that can be explained by this population having a relatively
low star-formation efficiency during its formation. A low star formation efficiency provides
an evolutionary connection between stars with high-alpha abundances and low metallicities, [Fe/H]$<$-1.1
dex, and stars with low-alpha abundances and higher metallicities. In dynamical and orbital spaces,
such as the "Toomre diagram", the two sequences show a significant overlap, but with a tendency for
stars on the blue-color sequence to dominate regions with no or retrograde rotation and high total
orbital energy. In the plane defined by the maximal vertical excursion of the orbits, $z_{\rm max}$,
versus their apocenters, $R_{\rm 2Dmax}$, stars of both sequences redistribute into discrete
wedges and we observe a dearth of stars with intermediate values of $z_{\rm max}$. We conclude that
stars which are typically assigned to the halo in the solar vicinity, i.e., those having either slightly
prograde or retrograde orbits, are actually both accreted stars lying along the blue sequence in
the HR diagram, and the low velocity tail of the old Galactic disk, possibly dynamically heated by
past accretion events. Our results imply that a halo population that formed \textit{in situ} and
was responsible for the early chemical enrichment prior to the formation of the thick disk is yet
to be robustly identified.
