The geochemistry and textural associations of chondritic phosphate minerals can provide insights
into the geological histories of parental asteroids, but the processes governing their formation
and deformation remain poorly constrained. Here, we present a quantitative assessment of phosphorus-bearing
mineral textures in the three variously-shocked lithologies (light, dark, and melt) of the Chelyabinsk
(LL5) ordinary chondrite using scanning electron microscope, electron microprobe, cathodoluminescence,
and electron backscatter diffraction techniques. Phase associations, microtextures, and microstructures
of phosphates are extremely variable within and between the differently-shocked lithologies
investigated in the Chelyabinsk meteorite. We observe continuously strained as well as unstrained
phosphate populations. Unstrained (recrystallized and annealed) grains are present only in the
more intensely shocked dark lithology, indicating that phosphate growth in Chelyabinsk predates
the development of primary shock-metamorphic textures. This disruption event is also recorded
by complete melting of portions of the meteorite to produce the shock-melt lithology, which contains
a population of phosphorus-rich olivine grains. We interpret the textures and phase associations
of Chelyabinsk to have resulted from initial phosphate growth via metasomatic olivine replacement,
followed by major deformation during an early shock-melting impact and a subsequent minor event.
This minor event appears to have generated a sub-population of phosphates that display patchy CL
textures, in both the light and dark lithology. Finally, we propose a new classification scheme
to describe various types of Phosphorus-Olivine-Assemblages (Type I-III POAs), which can be used
to classify shock metamorphic events and define the associated physicochemical processes.
