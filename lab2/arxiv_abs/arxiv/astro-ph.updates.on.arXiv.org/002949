Hydrodynamical instabilities and shocks are ubiquitous in astrophysical scenarios. Therefore,
an accurate numerical simulation of these phenomena is mandatory to correctly model and understand
many astrophysical events, such as Supernovas, stellar collisions, or planetary formation. In
this work, we attempt to address many of the problems that the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
technique has when dealing with subsonic hydrodynamical instabilities or shocks. To that aim we
built a new SPH code named SPHYNX, that includes many of the recent advances in the SPH technique and
some other new ones, which we present here. SPHYNX is of Newtonian type and grounded in the Euler-Lagrange
formulation of the SPH technique. Its distinctive features are: the use of an integral approach
to estimating the gradients; the use of a flexible family of interpolators called sinc kernels,
which suppress pairing instability; and the incorporation of a new type of volume element which
provides a better partition of the unity. Unlike other modern formulations, which consider volume
elements linked to pressure, our volume element choice relies on density. SPHYNX conserves mass,
linear and angular momentum, energy, entropy, and preserves kernel normalization even in strong
shocks. The coupling between the integral approach to calculate gradients and the new family of
volume elements reduces the so-called tensile instability. Both features help to suppress the
damp which often prevents the growth of hydrodynamic instabilities in regular SPH codes. On the
whole, SPHYNX has passed the verification tests described below. For identical particle setting
and initial conditions the results were similar (or better in some particular cases) than those
obtained with other SPH schemes such as GADGET-2, PSPH or with the recent density-independent formulation
(DISPH) and conservative reproducing kernel (CRKSPH) techniques.
