We present a detailed census of galaxies in and around PC217.96+32.3, a spectroscopically confirmed
Coma analog at z=3.78. Diverse galaxy types identified in the field include Lya emitters (LAEs),
massive star-forming galaxies, and ultra-massive galaxies (log (Mstar/Msun)>= 11) which may
have already halted their star formation. The sky distribution of the star-forming galaxies suggests
the presence of a significant overdensity (delta_g=8+/-2), which is spatially offset from the
previously confirmed members by 3-4 Mpc to the west. Candidate quiescent and post-starburst galaxies
are also found in large excess (a factor of ~ 8-15 higher surface density than the field) although
their redshifts are less certain. We estimate that the total enclosed mass traced by star-forming
galaxy candidates is roughly comparable to that of PC217.96+32.3 traced by the LAEs. We speculate
that the true extent of PC217.96+32.3 may be larger than previously known, a half of which is missed
by our LAE selection. Alternatively, the newly discovered overdensity may belong to another Coma
progenitor not associated with PC217.96+32.3. Expectations from theory suggest that both scenarios
are equally unlikely (<1%), particularly in the cosmic volume probed in our survey. If confirmed
as a single structure, its total mass will be well in excess of Coma, making this a singularly large
cosmic structure rarely seen even in large cosmological simulations. Finally, we find that the
protocluster galaxies follow the same SFR-M_star scaling relation as the field galaxies, suggesting
that the environmental effect at z~4 is a subtle one at best for normal star-forming galaxies.
