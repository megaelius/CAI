We study the effect a guiding magnetic field has on the structure of a pair jet that propagates through
a collisionless electron-proton plasma. We model with a PIC simulation a pair cloud with the temperature
400 keV and mean speed 0.9c. The cloud propagates through a spatially uniform, magnetized and cool
ambient electron-proton plasma that is at rest. The mean velocity vector of the pair cloud is aligned
with the uniform background magnetic field. A jet forms in time. Its outer cocoon consists of jet-accelerated
ambient plasma and is separated from the inner cocoon by an electromagnetic piston with a thickness
that is comparable to the local thermal gyroradius of jet particles. The inner cocoon consists of
pair plasma, which lost its directed flow energy while it swept out the background magnetic field
and compressed it into the electromagnetic piston. A beam of electrons and positrons moves along
the jet spine at its initial speed. Its electrons are slowed down and some positrons are accelerated
as they cross the jet's head. The latter escape upstream along the magnetic field, which yields an
excess of MeV positrons ahead of the jet. A filamentation instability accelerates some of the protons,
which were located behind the electromagnetic piston at the time it formed, to MeV energies. A microscopic
pair jet in collisionless plasma has a structure that is similar to that predicted by a hydrodynamic
model of relativistic astrophysical pair jets. It is a source of MeV positrons. An electromagnetic
piston acts as the contact discontinuity between the inner and outer cocoons. It would form on subsecond
time scales in a plasma with a density that is comparable to that of the interstellar medium in the
rest frame of the latter. A supercritical fast magnetosonic shock will form between the pristine
ambient plasma and the jet-accelerated on a longer time scale.
