Low-mass members of young stellar associations exhibit a wide spread of rotation periods. Such
a spread originates from distributions of masses and initial rotation periods. However, multiplicity
can also play a significant role. We investigate the role played by physical companions in shortening
the primordial disc lifetime. We have compiled the most extensive list of low-mass members of the
young 25-Myr beta Pictoris association. We have measured the rotation periods of about all members
and used updated UVWXYZ components to assess their membership. We built the rotation period distribution
distinguishing between bona fide members and candidate members and according to their multiplicity
status. We found that single stars and components of multiple systems in wide orbits (>80 AU) have
rotation periods that exhibit a well defined sequence arising from mass distribution. All components
of multiple systems in close orbits (<80 AU) have rotation periods significantly shorter than their
equal-mass single counterparts. A comparison with the younger 13 Myr h Per cluster and with the older
40-Myr open clusters/stellar associations NGC2547, IC2391, Argus, and IC2602 and the 130-Myr
Pleiades shows that whereas the evolution of F-G stars is well reproduced by angular momentum evolution
models, this is not the case for the slow K and early-M stars. Finally, we found that the amplitude
of their light curves is correlated neither with rotation nor with mass. Once single stars and wide
components of multiple systems are separated from close components of multiple systems, the rotation
period distributions exhibit a well defined dependence on mass that allows to make a meaningful
comparison with similar distributions of either younger or older associations/clusters. Such
cleaned distributions allow to use the stellar rotation period as age indicator, meaningfully
for F and G type stars.
