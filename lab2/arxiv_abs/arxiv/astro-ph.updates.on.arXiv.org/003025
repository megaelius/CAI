To improve our understanding of high-z galaxies we study the impact of H$_{2}$ chemistry on their
evolution, morphology and observed properties. We compare two zoom-in high-resolution (30 pc)
simulations of prototypical $M_{\star}\sim 10^{10} {\rm M}_{\odot}$ galaxies at $z=6$. The first,
"Dahlia", adopts an equilibrium model for H$_{2}$ formation, while the second, "Alth{\ae}a",
features an improved non-equilibrium chemistry network. The star formation rate (SFR) of the two
galaxies is similar (within 50\%), and increases with time reaching values close to 100 ${\rm M}_{\odot}/\rm
yr$ at $z=6$. They both have SFR-stellar mass relation consistent with observations, and a specific
SFR of $\simeq 5\, {\rm Gyr}^{-1}$. The main differences arise in the gas properties. The non-equilibrium
chemistry determines the H$\rightarrow$ H$_{2}$~transition to occur at densities $> 300\,{cm}^{-3}$,
i.e. about 10 times larger than predicted by the equilibrium model used for Dahlia. As a result, Alth{\ae}a
features a more clumpy and fragmented morphology, in turn making SN feedback more effective. Also,
because of the lower density and weaker feedback, Dahlia sits $3\sigma$ away from the Schmidt-Kennicutt
relation; Alth{\ae}a, instead nicely agrees with observations. The different gas properties
result in widely different observables. Alth{\ae}a outshines Dahlia by a factor of 7 (15) in [CII]~$157.74\,\mu{\rm
m}$ (H$_{2}$~$17.03\,\mu{\rm m}$) line emission. Yet, Alth{\ae}a is under-luminous with respect
to the locally observed [CII]-SFR relation. Whether this relation does not apply at high-z or the
line luminosity is reduced by CMB and metallicity effects remains as an open question.
