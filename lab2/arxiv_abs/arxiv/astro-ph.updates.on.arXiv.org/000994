This thesis research focusses on the study of the young and energetic isolated ordinary pulsar population
detected by the Fermi gamma-ray space telescope. We compared the model expectations of four emission
models and the LAT data. We found that all the models fail to reproduce the LAT detections, in particular
the large number of high spin-down power objects observed. This inconsistency is not model dependent.
A discrepancy between the radio-loud/radio-quiet objects ratio was also found between the observed
and predicted samples. The gamma-ray luminosity proportional to the 0.5 power of the spin-down
power relation is robustly confirmed by all the assumed models with particular agreement in the
slot gap (SG) case. On luminosity bases, the intermediate altitude emission of the two pole caustic
SG model is favoured. The beaming factor shows an spin-down power dependency that is slightly visible
in theSG case. Estimates of the pulsar orientations have been obtained to explain the simultaneous
gamma and radio light-curves. By analysing the solutions we found a relation between the observed
energy cutoff and the width of the emission slot gap. This relation has been theoretically predicted.
A possible magnetic obliquity alignment with time is rejected -for all the models- on timescale
of the order of a million years. The light-curve morphology study shows that the outer magnetosphere
gap emission are favoured to explain the observed radio-gamma lag. The light curve moment studies
(symmetry and sharpness) on the contrary favour a two pole caustic slot gap emission. All the model
predictions suggest a different magnetic field layout with an hybrid two pole caustic and intermediate
altitude emission to explain both the pulsar luminosity and light curve morphology . The low magnetosphere
emission mechanism of the polar cap model, is systematically rejected by all the tests done.
