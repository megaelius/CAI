The first gravitational-wave event from the merger of a binary neutron star system (GW170817) was
detected recently. The associated short gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) has a low isotropic luminosity
($\sim 10^{47}$ erg s$ ^{-1}$) and a peak energy $E_{p}\sim 145$ keV during the initial main emission
between -0.3 and 0.4 s. The origin of this short GRB is still under debate, but a plausible interpretation
is that it is due to the off-axis emission from a structured jet. We consider two possibilities. First,
since the best-fit spectral model for the main pulse of GRB 170817A is a cutoff power-law with a hard
low-energy photon index ($\alpha =-0.62_{-0.54}^{+0.49} $) between -0.3 and 0.4 s, we consider
an off-axis photosphere model. We develop a theory of photosphere emission in a structured jet and
find that such a model can reproduce a low energy photon index softer than blackbody through enhancing
high-latitude emission. The model can naturally account for the observed spectrum. The best-fit
Lorentz factor along the line of sight is $\sim 20$, which demands that there is a significant delay
between the merger and jet launching. Alternatively, we consider that the emission is produced
via synchrotron radiation in an optically thin region in an expanding jet with decreasing magnetic
fields. This model does not require a delay of jet launching but demands a larger bulk Lorentz factor
along the line of sight. We perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting to the data within the framework
of both models and obtain good fitting results in both cases. We report the best-fitting parameters
and discuss the implications for understanding the physical origin of this unique burst.
