As part of a series of papers aimed at understanding the evolution of the Milky Way's Central Molecular
Zone (CMZ), we present hydrodynamical simulations of turbulent molecular clouds orbiting in an
accurate model of the gravitational potential extant there. We consider two sets of model clouds
differing in the energy content of their velocity fields. In the first, self--virialised set, the
turbulent kinetic energies are chosen to be close in magnitude to the clouds' self--gravitational
potential energies. Comparison with isolated clouds evolving without an external potential shows
that the self--virialised clouds are unable to withstand the compressive tidal field of the CMZ
and rapidly collapse, forming stars much faster and reaching gas exhaustion after a small fraction
of a Galactocentric orbit. In the second, tidally--virialised, set of simulations, the clouds'
turbulent kinetic energies are in equilibrium with the external tidal field. These models are better
supported against the field and the stronger turbulence suppresses star formation. Our results
strongly support the inference that anomalously low star formation rates in the CMZ are due primarily
to high velocity dispersions in the molecular gas. The clouds follow open, eccentric orbits oscillating
in all three spatial coordinates. We examine the consequences of the orbital dynamics, particularly
pericentre passage, by performing companion simulations of clouds on circular orbits. The increased
tidal forces at pericentre produce transient accelerations in star formation rates of at most a
factor of 2.7. Our results demonstrate that modelling star formation in galactic centres requires
the inclusion of tidal forces.
