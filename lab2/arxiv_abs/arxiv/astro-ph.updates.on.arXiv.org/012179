As part of a study funded by NASA Headquarters, we are developing a Probe-class mission concept called
the Cosmic Evolution Through UV Spectroscopy (CETUS). CETUS includes a 1.5-m aperture diameter
telescope with a large field-of-view (FOV). CETUS includes three scientific instruments: a Far
Ultraviolet (FUV) and Near Ultraviolet (NUV) imaging camera (CAM); a NUV Multi-Object Spectrograph
(MOS); and a dual-channel Point Source Spectrograph (PSS) in the Lyman Ultraviolet (LUV), FUV,
and NUV spectral regions. The large FOV Three Mirror Anastigmatic (TMA) Optical Telescope Assembly
(OTA) simultaneously feeds the three separate scientific instruments. That is, the instruments
view separate portions of the TMA image plane, enabling parallel operation of the three instruments.
The field viewed by the MOS, whose design is based on an Offner-type spectrographic configuration
to provide wide FOV correction, is actively configured to select and isolate numerous field sources
using a next-generation Micro-Shutter Array (MSA). The two-channel camera design is also based
on an Offner-like configuration. The Point Source Spectrograph (PSS) performs high spectral resolution
spectroscopy on unresolved objects over the NUV region with spectral resolving power, R~ 40,000,
in an echelle mode. The PSS also performs long-slit imaging spectroscopy at R~ 20,000 in the LUV and
FUV spectral regions with two aberration-corrected, blazed, holographic gratings used in a Rowland-like
configuration. The optical system also includes two Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS), and Wavefront
Sensors (WFS) that sample numerous locations over the full OTA FOV. In-flight wavelength calibration
is performed by a Wavelength Calibration System (WCS), and flat-fielding is also performed, both
using in-flight calibration sources. This paper will describe the current optical design and the
major trade studies leading to the design.
