The five-year Dark Energy Survey supernova programme (DES-SN) is one of the largest and deepest
transient surveys to date in terms of volume and number of supernovae. Identifying and characterising
the host galaxies of transients plays a key role in their classification, the study of their formation
mechanisms, and the cosmological analyses. To derive accurate host galaxy properties, we create
depth-optimised coadds using single-epoch DES-SN images that are selected based on sky and atmospheric
conditions. For each of the five DES-SN seasons, a separate coadd is made from the other 4 seasons
such that each SN has a corresponding deep coadd with no contaminating SN emission. The coadds reach
limiting magnitudes of order $\sim 27$ in $g$-band, and have a much smaller magnitude uncertainty
than the previous DES-SN host templates, particularly for faint objects. We present the resulting
multi-band photometry of host galaxies for samples of spectroscopically confirmed type Ia (SNe
Ia), core-collapse (CCSNe), and superluminous (SLSNe) as well as rapidly evolving transients
(RETs) discovered by DES-SN. We derive host galaxy stellar masses and probabilistically compare
stellar-mass distributions to samples from other surveys. We find that the DES spectroscopically
confirmed sample of SNe Ia selects preferentially fewer high mass hosts at high redshift compared
to other surveys, while at low redshift the distributions are consistent. DES CCSNe and SLSNe hosts
are similar to other samples, while RET hosts are unlike the hosts of any other transients, although
these differences have not been disentangled from selection effects.
