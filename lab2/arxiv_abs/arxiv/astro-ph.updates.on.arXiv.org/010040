We aim at constraining the stellar population properties of quiescent galaxies. These properties
reveal how these galaxies evolved and assembled since $z\sim1$ up to the present time. Combining
the ALHAMBRA multi-filter photo-spectra with the SED-fitting code MUFFIT, we build a complete
catalogue of quiescent galaxies via the dust-corrected stellar mass vs colour diagram. This catalogue
includes stellar population properties, such as age, metallicity, extinction, stellar mass and
photometric redshift, retrieved from the analysis of composited populations based on two independent
sets of SSP models. We develop and apply a novel methodology to provide, for the first time, the analytic
probability distribution functions (PDFs) of mass-weighted age, metallicity, and extinction
of quiescent galaxies as a function of redshift and stellar mass. We adopt different star formation
histories to discard potential systematics in the analysis. The number density of quiescent galaxies
is found to increase since $z\sim1$, with a more substantial variation at lower mass. Quiescent
galaxies feature extinction $A_V<0.6$, with median values in the range $A_V = 0.15\mathrm{-}0.3$.
At increasing stellar mass, quiescent galaxies are older and more metal rich since $z\sim1$. A detailed
analysis of the PDFs reveals that the evolution of quiescent galaxies is not compatible with passive
evolution and a slight decrease is hinted at median metallicity $0.1\mathrm{-}0.2$~dex. The intrinsic
dispersion of the age and metallicity PDFs show a dependence with stellar mass and/or redshift.
These results are consistent with both sets of SSP models and the alternative SFH assumptions explored.
Consequently, the quiescent population must undergo an evolutive pathway including mergers and/or
remnants of star formation to reconcile the observed trends, where the `progenitor' bias should
also be taken into account.
