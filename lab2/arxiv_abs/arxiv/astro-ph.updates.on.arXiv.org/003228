We report on the galaxy MACSJ0032-arc at z=3.6314 discovered during the Herschel Lensing snapshot
Survey of massive galaxy clusters, and strongly lensed by the cluster MACSJ0032.1+1808. The successful
detections of its rest-frame UV, optical, FIR, millimeter, and radio continua, and of its CO emission
enable us to characterize, for the first time at such a high redshift, the stellar, dust, and molecular
gas properties of a compact star-forming galaxy with a size smaller than 2.5 kpc, a fairly low stellar
mass of 4.8x10^9 Msun, and a moderate IR luminosity of 4.8x10^11 Lsun. We find that the bulk of the
molecular gas mass and star formation seems to be spatially decoupled from the rest-frame UV emission.
About 90% of the total star formation rate is undetected at rest-frame UV wavelengths because of
severe obscuration by dust, but is seen through the thermal FIR dust emission and the radio synchrotron
radiation. The observed CO(4-3) and CO(6-5) lines demonstrate that high-J transitions, at least
up to J=6, remain excited in this galaxy, whose CO spectral line energy distribution resembles that
of high-redshift submm galaxies, even though the IR luminosity of MACSJ0032-arc is ten times lower.
This high CO excitation is possibly due to the compactness of the galaxy. We find evidence that this
high CO excitation has to be considered in the balance when estimating the CO-to-H2 conversion factor.
The inferred depletion time of the molecular gas in MACSJ0032-arc supports the decrease in the gas
depletion timescale of galaxies with redshift, although to a lesser degree than predicted by galaxy
evolution models. Instead, the measured molecular gas fraction as high as 60-79% in MACSJ0032-arc
favors the continued increase in the gas fraction of galaxies with redshift as expected, despite
the plateau observed between z~1.5 and z~2.5.
