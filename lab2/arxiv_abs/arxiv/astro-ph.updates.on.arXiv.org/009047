With the same method as used previously, we investigate neutrino-driven explosions of a larger
sample of blue supergiant models. The larger sample includes three new presupernova stars. The
results are compared with light-curve observations of the peculiar type IIP SN 1987A. The explosions
were modeled in 3D with the neutrino-hydrodynamics code PROMETHEUS-HOTB, and light-curve calculations
were performed in spherical symmetry with the radiation-hydrodynamics code CRAB. Our results
confirm the basic findings of the previous work: 3D neutrino-driven explosions with SN 1987A-like
energies synthesize an amount of Ni-56 that is consistent with the radioactive tail of the light
curve. Moreover, the models mix hydrogen inward to minimum velocities below 400 km/s as required
by spectral observations. Hydrodynamic simulations with the new progenitor models, which possess
smaller radii than the older ones, show much better agreement between calculated and observed light
curves in the initial luminosity peak and during the first 20 days. A set of explosions with similar
energies demonstrated that a high growth factor of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the (C+O)/He
composition interface combined with a weak interaction of fast Rayleigh-Taylor plumes, where
the reverse shock occurs below the He/H interface, provides a sufficient condition for efficient
outward mixing of Ni-56 into the hydrogen envelope. This condition is realized to the required extent
only in one of the older stellar models, which yielded a maximum velocity of around 3000 km/s for the
bulk of ejected Ni-56, but failed to reproduce the helium-core mass of 6 Msun inferred from the absolute
luminosity of the presupernova star. We conclude that none of the single-star progenitor models
proposed for SN 1987A to date satisfies all constraints set by observations. (Abridged)
