The spin pattern of a spiral galaxy is a matter of the perspective of the observer, and therefore galaxies
with clockwise spin patterns are expected to be identical in their characteristics to galaxies
with counterclockwise spin patterns. However, observations of a large number of galaxies show
clear photometric differences between clockwise and counterclockwise spiral galaxies. In this
study the magnitude difference between clockwise and counterclockwise spiral galaxies imaged
by the space-based COSMOS survey is compared to galaxies imaged by the Earth-based SDSS and PanSTARRS
around the same field. The comparison shows that the same asymmetry was identified by all three telescopes,
providing strong evidence that the rotation direction of the galaxy affects its magnitude as measured
from Earth. Analysis of a large number of galaxies from different parts of the sky shows that the differences
between clockwise and counterclockwise galaxies are oriented around an axis such that the photometric
asymmetry in one hemisphere is inverse to the photometric asymmetry in the opposite hemisphere.
Due to the provocative nature of the observation, it is difficult to identify an immediate explanation.
A possible explanation could be related to the large-scale structure of the universe, which leads
to violation of the cosmological homogeneity assumption. Another possible explanation that does
not require the violation of the cosmological principle is that the observation is driven by galaxy
rotation. Due to relativistic beaming, such difference is indeed expected to be identified and
peak at the galactic pole, but it is expected to be far smaller than the differences observed by all
three telescopes. Therefore, if the asymmetry is driven by galaxy rotation, it corresponds to a
much higher velocity than the actual measured rotational velocity of galaxies.
