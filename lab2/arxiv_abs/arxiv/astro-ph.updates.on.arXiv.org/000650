Context: Dynamical studies of irradiated circumstellar disks require an accurate treatment of
radiation transport to, for example, properly determine cooling and fragmentation properties.
The radiation transport algorithm should be as fast as the (magneto-) hydrodynamics to allow for
an efficient usage of computing resources. Methods: We use a setup of a central star and a slightly
flared circumstellar disk. We perform simulations for a wide range of optical depths of the disk's
midplane from tau(550nm) = 0.1 up to tau(810nm) = 1 million. We check the accuracy of the gray flux-limited
diffusion (FLD) approximation and a gray and frequency-dependent ray-tracing plus FLD approximation.
Results: 1. For moderate optical depths, a gray approximation of the stellar irradiation yields
a slightly hotter inner rim and a slightly cooler midplane of the disk at larger radii, but is otherwise
in agreement with the frequency-dependent treatment. 2. The gray FLD approximation fails to compute
an appropriate temperature profile in all regimes of optical depth; the maximum deviations to the
comparison runs are 50 percent in the optically thin and up to 280 percent in the optically thick limit.
For low optical depth, the isotropic assumption within the FLD method yields a too steep decrease
of the radial temperature slope. For higher optical depths, the FLD approximation does not reproduce
the shadow behind the optically thick inner rim of the circumstellar disk, yielding artificial
heating at larger disk radii. 3. The frequency-dependent RT + gray FLD approximation yields remarkable
accuracy for the whole range of optical depths. Conclusions: The high accuracy of the frequency-dependent
hybrid radiation transport algorithm makes this method ideally suited for (magneto-) hydrodynamical
studies of irradiated circumstellar disks.
