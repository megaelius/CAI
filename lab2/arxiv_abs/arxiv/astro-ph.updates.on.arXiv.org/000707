Stars evolving along the Asymptotic Giant Branch can become Carbon-rich in the final part of their
evolution. They replenish the inter-stellar medium with nuclear processed material via strong
radiative stellar winds. The determination of the luminosity function of these stars, even if far
from being conclusive, is extremely important to test the reliability of theoretical models. In
particular, strong constraints on the mixing treatment and the mass-loss rate can be derived. We
present an updated Luminosity Function of Galactic Carbon Stars obtained from a re-analysis of
available data already published in previous papers. Starting from available near- and mid-infrared
photometric data, we re-determine the selection criteria. Moreover, we take advantage from updated
distance estimates and Period-Luminosity relations and we adopt a new formulation for the computation
of Bolometric Corrections. This leads us to collect an improved sample of carbon-rich sources from
which we construct an updated Luminosity Function. The Luminosity Function of Galactic Carbon
Stars peaks at magnitudes around -4.9, confirming the results obtained in a previous work. Nevertheless,
the Luminosity Function presents two symmetrical tails instead of the larger high luminosity tail
characterizing the former Luminosity Function. The derived Luminosity Function of Galactic Carbon
Stars matches the indications coming from recent theoretical evolutionary Asymptotic Giant Branch
models, thus confirming the validity of the choices of mixing treatment and mass-loss history.
Moreover, we compare our new Luminosity Function with its counterpart in the Large Magellanic Cloud
finding that the two distributions are very similar for dust-enshrouded sources, as expected from
stellar evolutionary models. Finally, we derive a new fitting formula aimed to better determine
Bolometric Corrections for C-stars.
