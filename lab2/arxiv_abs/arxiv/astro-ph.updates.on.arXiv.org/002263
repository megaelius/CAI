This Letter of Intent (LoI) describes the outline and plan for the Neutrino Telescope Array (NTA)
project. High-energy neutrinos provide unique and indisputable evidence for hadronic acceleration,
as well as a most accurate probe into the hidden sector of traditional astronomy or physics, such
as dark matter. However, their extremely low flux and interaction cross section make their detection
extraordinarily difficult. Recently, IceCube has reported astronomical neutrino candidates
in excess of expectation from atmospheric secondaries, but is limited by the water Cherenkov detection
method. A next generation high-energy neutrino telescope should be capable of establishing indisputable
evidence for cosmic high-energy neutrinos. It should not only have orders-of-magnitude larger
sensitivity, but also enough pointing accuracy to probe known or unknown astronomical objects,
without suffering from atmospheric secondaries. The proposed installation is a large array of
compound eye stations of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov and fluorescence detectors, with wide
field of view and refined observational ability of air showers from cosmic tau neutrinos in the PeV-EeV
energy range. This advanced optical complex system is based substantially on the development of
All-sky Survey High Resolution Air-shower detector (Ashra) and applies the tau shower Earth-skimming
method to survey PeV-EeV $\nu_{\tau}$s. It allows wide (30$^{\circ}$$\times$360$^{\circ}$)
and deep ($\sim$400Mpc) survey observation for PeV-EeV $\nu_{\tau}$s assuming the standard GRB
neutrino fluence. In addition, it enjoys the pointing accuracy of better than 0.2$^{\circ}$ in
essentially background-free conditions. With the advanced imaging of Earth-skimming tau showers,
we aim for clear discovery and identification of astronomical $\nu_{\tau}$ sources, providing
inescapable evidence of the origin of extremely high energy protons.
