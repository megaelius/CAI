We present a detailed spectroscopic investigation of the young eruptive star PV Cep, to improve
our understanding of its nature and characterise its circumstellar environment after its last
outburst in 2004. The analysis of our medium-resolution spectroscopy in the near-IR (0.9-2.35
um), collected in 2012 at the Large Binocular Telescope with the IR spectrograph LUCIFER, allows
us to infer the main stellar parameters (visual extinction, accretion luminosity, mass accretion
and ejection rates), and model the inner disc, jet, and wind. The NIR spectrum displays several strong
emission lines associated with accretion/ejection activity and circumstellar environment.
Our analysis shows that the brightness of PV Cep is fading, as well as the mass accretion rate (2x10^-7
Msun/yr^-1 in 2012 vs ~5x10^-6 Msun/yr^-1 in 2004), which is more than one order of magnitude lower
than in the outburst phase. Among the several emission lines, only the [FeII] intensity increased
after the outburst. The observed [FeII] emission delineates blue- and red-shifted lobes, both
with high- and low-velocity components, which trace an asymmetric jet and wind, respectively.
The observed emission in the jet has a dynamical age of ~8 years, indicating that it was produced during
the last outburst. The mass ejection rate in both lobes is 1.5x10^-7 Msun/yr^-1, approximately
matching the high accretion rate observed during and immediately after the outburst . The observed
jet/outflow asymmetries are consistent with an inhomogeneous medium. Our modelling of the CO emission
hints at a small-scale gaseous disc ring, extending from ~0.2-0.4 AU to ~3 AU from the source, with
an inner temperature of ~3000 K. Our HI lines modelling indicates that most of the observed emission
comes from an expanding disc wind at Te=10000 K. The line profiles are strongly affected by scattering,
disc screening, and outflow self-absorption.
