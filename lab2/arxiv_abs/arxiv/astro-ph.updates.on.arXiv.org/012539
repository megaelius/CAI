Magnetic reconnection in current sheets converts magnetic energy into particle energy. The process
may play an important role in the acceleration and heating of the solar wind close to the Sun. Observations
from Parker Solar Probe provide a new opportunity to study this problem, as it measures the solar
wind at unprecedented close distances to the Sun. During the 1st orbit, PSP encountered a large number
of current sheets in the solar wind through perihelion at 35.7 solar radii. We performed a comprehensive
survey of these current sheets and found evidence for 21 reconnection exhausts. These exhausts
were observed in heliospheric current sheets, coronal mass ejections, and regular solar wind.
However, we find that the majority of current sheets encountered around perihelion, where the magnetic
field was strongest and plasma beta was lowest, were Alfv\'enic structures associated with bursty
radial jets and these current sheets did not appear to be undergoing local reconnection. We examined
conditions around current sheets to address why some current sheets reconnected, while others
did not. A key difference appears to be the degree of plasma velocity shear across the current sheets:
The median velocity shear for the 21 reconnection exhausts was 24% of the Alfv\'en velocity shear,
whereas the median shear across 43 Alfv\'enic current sheets examined was 71% of the Alfv\'en velocity
shear. This finding could suggest that large, albeit sub-Alfv\'enic, velocity shears suppress
reconnection. An alternative interpretation is that the Alfv\'enic current sheets are isolated
rotational discontinuities which do not undergo local reconnection.
