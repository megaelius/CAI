With increasing sensitivity, angular resolution, and frequency coverage, future cosmic microwave
background (CMB) experiments like PICO (Probe of Inflation and Cosmic Origins) will allow us to
access new information about galaxy clusters through the relativistic thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich
(SZ) effect. We will be able to map the temperature of relativistic electrons across the entire sky,
going well beyond a simple detection of the relativistic SZ effect by cluster stacking methods that
currently define the state-of-the-art. Here, we propose a new map-based approach utilizing SZ-temperature
moment expansion and Constrained-ILC methods to extract electron gas temperature maps from foreground-obscured
CMB data. This delivers a new independent map-based observable, the electron temperature power
spectrum, which can be used to constrain cosmology in addition to the Compton-$y$ power spectrum.
We find that PICO has the required sensitivity, spatial resolution, and frequency coverage to accurately
map the electron gas temperature of galaxy clusters across the full sky, covering a broad range of
angular scales. In particular, frequency-coverage at $\nu\gtrsim 300\,{\rm GHz}$ plays an important
role for the extractions of the relativistic SZ effect in the presence of foregrounds. For Coma,
PICO will allow us to directly reconstruct the electron temperature profile using the relativistic
SZ effect. Coma's average electron temperature will be measured to $\simeq 10\sigma$ significance
after foreground removal using PICO. Low-angular resolution CMB experiment like LiteBIRD could
achieve $2\sigma$ to $3\sigma$ measurement of the electron temperature of this largest cluster.
Our analysis highlights a new spectroscopic window into the thermodynamic properties of galaxy
clusters and the diffuse electron gas at large angular scales.
