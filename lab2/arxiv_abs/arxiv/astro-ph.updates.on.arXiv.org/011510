We investigate the long GRB140629A through multiwavelength observations, which cover optical,
infrared and X-rays between 40s and 3yr after the burst, to derive the properties of the dominant
jet and its host galaxy. Polarisation observations by the MASTER telescope indicate that this burst
is weakly polarised. The optical spectrum contains absorption features, from which we confirm
the redshift of the GRB as originating at z=2.276. We performed spectral fitting of the X-rays to
optical afterglow data and find there is no strong spectral evolution. We determine the hydrogen
column density to be 7.2x10^21cm^-2 along the line of sight. The afterglow in this burst can be explained
by a blast wave jet with a long-lasting central engine expanding into a uniform medium in the slow
cooling regime. At the end of energy injection, a normal decay phase is observed in both the optical
and X-ray bands. An achromatic jet break is also found in the afterglow light curves 0.4d after trigger.
We fit the multiwavelength data simultaneously with a model based on a numerical simulation and
find that the observations can be explained by a narrow uniform jet in a dense environment with an
opening angle of 6.7deg viewed 3.8deg off-axis, which released a total energy of 1.4x10^54erg.
Using the redshift and opening angle, we find GRB 140629A follows both the Ghirlanda and Amati relations.
From the peak time of the light curve, identified as the onset of the forward shock (181s after trigger),
the initial Lorentz factor is constrained in the range 82-118. Fitting the host galaxy photometry,
we find the host to be a low mass, star-forming galaxy with a star formation rate of logSFR=1.1^+0.9_-0.4Myr^-1.
We obtain a value of the neutral hydrogen density by fitting the optical spectrum, logN(HI)=21.0+-0.3,
classifying this host as a damped Lyman-alpha. High ionisation lines are also detected in the spectrum.
