We report deep ALMA observations complemented with associated HST imaging for a luminous (m_uv=25)
galaxy, `Himiko', at a redshift z=6.595. The galaxy is remarkable for its high star formation rate,
100 Mo/yr, securely estimated from our deep HST and Spitzer photometry, and the absence of any evidence
for strong AGN activity or gravitational lensing magnification. Our ALMA observations probe an
order of magnitude deeper than previous IRAM observations, yet fail to detect a 1.2mm dust continuum,
indicating a flux <52uJy comparable with or weaker than that of local dwarf irregulars with much
lower star formation rates. We likewise provide a strong upper limit for the flux of [CII] 158um,
L([CII]) < 5.4x10^7 Lo, a diagnostic of the hot interstellar gas often described as a valuable
probe for early galaxies. In fact, our observations indicate Himiko lies off the local L([CII])
- star formation rate scaling relation by a factor of more than 30. Both aspects of our ALMA observations
suggest Himiko is an unique object with a very low dust content and perhaps nearly primordial interstellar
gas. Our HST images provide unique insight into the morphology of this remarkable source, highlighting
an extremely blue core of activity and two less extreme associated clumps. Himiko is undergoing
a triple major merger event whose extensive ionized nebula of Lyman alpha emitting gas, discovered
in our earlier work with Subaru, is powered by star formation and the dense circum-galactic gas.
We are likely witnessing an early massive galaxy during a key period of its mass assembly close to
the end of the reionization era.
