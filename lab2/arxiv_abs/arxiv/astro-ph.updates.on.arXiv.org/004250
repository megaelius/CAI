We present sensitive 870$\mu$m continuum measurements from our ALMA programmes of 114 X-ray selected
AGN in the CDF-S and COSMOS fields. We use these observations in combination with data from Spitzer
and Herschel to construct a sample of 86 X-ray selected AGN, 63 with ALMA constraints at $z=1.5-3.2$
with stellar mass $>2\times10^{10}M_{\odot}$. We constructed broad-band spectral energy distributions
in the infrared band (8 - 1000$\mu$m) and constrain star-formation rates (SFRs) uncontaminated
by the AGN. Using a hierarchical Bayesian method that takes into account the information from upper
limits, we fit SFR and specific SFR (sSFR) distributions. We explore these distributions as a function
of both X-ray luminosity and stellar mass. We compare our measurements to two versions of the EAGLE
hydrodynamical simulations: the reference model with AGN feedback and the model without AGN. We
find good agreement between the observations and that predicted by the EAGLE reference model for
the modes and widths of the sSFR distributions as a function of both X-ray luminosity and stellar
mass; however, we found that the EAGLE model without AGN feedback predicts a significantly narrower
width when compared to the data. Overall, from the combination of the observations with the model
predictions, we conclude that (1) even with AGN feedback, we expect no strong relationship between
the sSFR distribution parameters and instantaneous AGN luminosity and (2) a signature of AGN feedback
is a broad distribution of sSFRs for all galaxies (not just those hosting an AGN) with stellar masses
above $\approx 10^{10}$M$_{\odot}$.
