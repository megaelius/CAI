In this work, I present a set of long-term, direct, relativistic many-body computations of model
dense stellar clusters with up-to-date remnant mass and natal-kick models, including pair instability
and pulsation pair instability supernova (PSN and PPSN), using NBODY7 N-body simulation program.
The new model implementations also incorporate natal spins of BHs, based on theoretical stellar-evolutionary
models, and runtime tracking of GR merger recoils and final spins in binary black hole (BBH) mergers,
based on numerical relativity. These, for the first time in a direct N-body simulation, allow for
second-generation BBH mergers. The set of 65 evolutionary models have initial masses $10^4M_\odot-10^5M_\odot$,
sizes 1 pc-3 pc, metallicity 0.0001-0.02, with the massive stars in primordial binaries and they
represent young massive clusters (YMC) and moderately massive open clusters (OC). Such models
produce dynamically-paired BBH mergers that agree well with the observed masses, mass ratios,
effective spin parameters, and final spins of the LVC O1/O2 merger events and also with their overall
trends and boundaries, provided BHs are born with low or no spin but spin up after undergoing a BBH
merger or matter accretion onto it. In particular, the distinctly higher mass, effective spin parameter,
and final spin of GW170729 merger event is naturally reproduced. The computed models also produce
massive, $\sim100M_\odot$ BBH mergers with primary mass within the "PSN gap". Depending on the
remnant-mass and natal-kick scenarios, such models also yield mergers involving remnants in the
NS-BH "mass gap" as detected in the LVC O3. These computations also suggest that YMCs and OCs produce
persistent GW sources detectable by LISA from within the $\sim100$ Mpc Local Universe. Such clusters
are also capable of producing mergers with eccentricity detectable by the LIGO-Virgo.
