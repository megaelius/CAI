Evidence from the BICEP2 experiment for a significant gravitational-wave background has focussed
attention on inflaton potentials $V(\phi) \propto \phi^\alpha$ with $\alpha=2$ ("chaotic" or
"$m^2\phi^2$" inflation) or with smaller values of $\alpha$, as may arise in axion-monodromy models.
Here we show that reheating considerations may provide additional constraints to these models.
The reheating phase preceding the radiation era is modeled by an effective equation-of-state parameter
$w_{\rm re}$. The canonical reheating scenario is then described by $w_{\rm re}=0$. The simplest
$\alpha=2$ models are consistent with $w_{\rm re} =0$ for values of $n_s$ well within the current
$1\sigma$ range. Models with $\alpha=1$ or $\alpha=2/3$ require a more exotic reheating phase,
with $-1/3<w_{\rm re}<0$, unless $n_s$ is close to the current $2\sigma$ upper bound. Likewise,
models with $\alpha=4$ require a physically implausible $w_{\rm re}>1/3$, unless $n_s$ is
close to the lower limit of the $2\sigma$ range. For $m^2\phi^2$ inflation and canonical reheating,
we derive a relation $\log_{10}\left(T_{\rm re}/100\,{\rm GeV} \right) \simeq 2000\,(n_s-0.96)$
between the reheat temperature $T_{\rm re}$ and the scalar spectral index $n_s$. Thus, if $n_s$
is close to its central value, then $T_{\rm re}\lesssim 50$ GeV is uncomfortably close to the electroweak
scale. If the reheat temperature is higher, as most theorists would probably prefer, then the scalar
spectral index should be closer to $n_s\simeq0.967$, near the upper limit of the $1\sigma$ error
range. Improved precision in the measurement of $n_s$ should allow $m^2\phi^2$, axion-monodromy,
and $\phi^4$ models to be distinguished, even without precise measurement of $r$, and to test the
$m^2\phi^2$ expectation of $n_s\simeq0.967$.
