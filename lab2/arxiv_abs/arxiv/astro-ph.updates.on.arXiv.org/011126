Blazars are a remarkable type of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) that are playing an important and rapidly
growing role in today's multi-frequency and multi-messenger astrophysics. In the past several
years, blazars have been discovered in relatively large numbers in radio, microwave, X-ray and
gamma-ray surveys, and more recently have been associated to high-energy astrophysical neutrinos
and possibly to ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Blazars are expected to dominate the high-energy
extragalactic sky that will soon be surveyed by the new generation of very-high-energy gamma-ray
observatories such as CTA. In parallel to the discovery of many blazars at all frequencies, the technological
evolution, together with the increasing adoption of open data policies is causing and exponential
growth of astronomical data that is freely available through the network of Virtual Observatories
(VO) and the web in general, providing an unprecedented potential for multi-wavelength and multi-messenger
data analysis. We present VOU-Blazars, a tool developed within the OU, initiative that has been
designed to facilitate the discovery of blazars and build their spectral energy distributions
(SED) using multi-wavelength photometric and spectral data that are available from public archives,
or that have been generated as part of the OU, initiative and are accessible through VO services.
VOU-Blazars implements a heuristic approach based on the well known SED that differentiate blazars
from other astronomical sources. The VOU-Blazars outputs are flux tables, bibliographic references,
sky plots and SEDs. VOU-Blazars has been extensively tested during the selection of new high-energy
peaked (HSP) blazars recently published in the 3HSP catalog, and has been used to search for blazar
counterparts of Fermi 3FHL, Fermi 4FGL, AGILE sources, and of IceCube astrophysical neutrinos.
