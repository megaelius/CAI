The Milky Way's central molecular zone (CMZ), i.e. the star-forming nuclear ring at $R\lesssim200$
pc, has emerged in recent years as a unique laboratory for the study star formation. In this paper
we use the simulations presented in Tress et al. 2020 to investigate star formation in the CMZ. The
simulations include the gas flow in the whole inner disc ($R\leq5$ kpc) of the Milky Way, which allows
us to assess how the large-scale environment affects the formation of stars in the CMZ. We comfortably
reach sub-parsec resolution, which allows us to resolve individual molecular clouds. Our main
findings are as follows. (1) By studying the spatial and temporal distribution of stars formed along
the CMZ ring, we find that most of the star formation happens downstream of the apocentres, consistent
with the "pearls-on-a-string" scenario. (2) Our simulations do not support the notion that an absolute
evolutionary timeline of star formation triggered by pericentre passage can be identified as gas
clouds orbit in the CMZ ring. (3) Within the timescale of our simulation ($\sim100$ Myr), the depletion
time of the CMZ is constant within a factor of $\sim2$. This suggests that variations in the star formation
rate are primarily driven by variations in the mass of the CMZ, caused for example by changes in the
bar-driven inflow rate, AGN feedback, or other external events, and not by variations in the depletion
time. (4) We study the trajectories of newly born stars in our simulations. We find several examples
that have age, line-of-sight velocity and proper motion velocity compatible with the Arches and
Quintuplet clusters. Our simulation suggests that these prominent clusters originate near the
collision sites where the bar-driven inflow accretes onto the CMZ, at symmetrical locations with
respect to the Galactic centre, and that they have already decoupled from the gas in which they were
born.
