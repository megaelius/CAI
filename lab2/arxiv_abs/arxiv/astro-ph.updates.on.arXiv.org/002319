The cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large scale structure (LSS) are complementary probes
to investigate the early and late time universe. After the current accomplishment of the high accuracies
of CMB measurements, accompanying precision cosmology from LSS data is emphasized. We investigate
the dynamical dark energy (DE) models which can produce the same CMB angular power spectra as that
of the LCDM model with less than a sub-percent level accuracy. If one adopts the dynamical DE models
using the so-called Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, w = w0 + wa(1-a), then
one obtains models (w0,wa)= (-0.8,-0.767), (-0.9,-0.375), (-1.1,0.355), (-1.2,0.688) named
as M8, M9, M11, and M12, respectively. The differences of the growth rate, f which is related to the
redshift space distortions (RSD) between different DE models and the LCDM model are about 0.2% only
at z=0. The difference of f between M8 (M9, M11, M12) and the LCDM model becomes maximum at z ~ 0.25 with
-2.4 (-1.2, 1.2, 2.5)%. This is a scale-independent quantity. One can investigate the one-loop
correction of the matter power spectrum of each model using the standard perturbation theory in
order to probe the scale-dependent quantity in the quasi-linear regime ({\it i.e.} k < 0.4 h/Mpc).
The differences in the matter power spectra including the one-loop correction between M8 (M9, M11,
M12) and the LCDM model for k= 0.4 h/Mpc scale are 1.8 (1.0, 1.3, 3.0)% at z=0, 3.0 (1.7, 2.0, 4.2)% at
z=0.5, and 3.2 (1.7, 2.2, 4.4)% at z=1.0. The bigger departure from $-1$ of w0, the larger the difference
in the power spectrum. Thus, one should use both the RSD and the quasi-linear observable in order
to discriminate a viable DE model among a slew of models which are degenerated in CMB. Also we obtain
the lower limit on w0 > -1.5 from the CMB acoustic peaks and this will provide the useful limitation
on phantom models.
