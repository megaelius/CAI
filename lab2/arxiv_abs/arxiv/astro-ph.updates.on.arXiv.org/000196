ALMA observations of the Galactic center with spatial resolution $2.61"\times0.97"$ resulted
in the detection of 11 SiO (5-4) clumps of molecular gas within 0.6pc (15$"$) of Sgr A*, interior to
the 2-pc circumnuclear molecular ring. The three SiO (5-4) clumps closest to Sgr A* show the largest
central velocities, $\sim150$ \kms, and broadest asymmetric linewidths with full width zero intensity
(FWZI) $\sim110-147$ \kms. The remaining clumps, distributed mainly to the NE of the ionized mini-spiral,
have narrow FWZI ($\sim18-56$ \kms). Using CARMA SiO (2-1) data, LVG modeling of the the SiO line
ratios for the broad velocity clumps, constrains the column density N(SiO) $\sim10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$,
and the H$_2$ gas density n$_{\rm H_2}=(3-9)\times10^5$ cm$^{-3}$ for an assumed kinetic temperature
100-200K. The SiO clumps are interpreted as highly embedded protostellar outflows, signifying
an early stage of massive star formation near Sgr A* in the last $10^4-10^5$ years. Support for this
interpretation is provided by the SiO (5-4) line luminosities and velocity widths which lie in the
range measured for protostellar outflows in star forming regions in the Galaxy. Furthermore, SED
modeling of stellar sources shows two YSO candidates near SiO clumps, supporting in-situ star formation
near Sgr A*. We discuss the nature of star formation where the gravitational potential of the black
hole dominates. In particular, we suggest that external radiative pressure exerted on self-shielded
molecular clouds enhances the gas density, before the gas cloud become gravitationally unstable
near Sgr A*. Alternatively, collisions between clumps in the ring may trigger gravitational collapse.
