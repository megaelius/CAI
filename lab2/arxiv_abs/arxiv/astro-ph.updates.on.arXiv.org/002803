We investigate the evolution of galaxy clustering for galaxies in the redshift range 2.0<$z$<5.0
using the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS). We present the projected (real-space) two-point correlation
function $w_p(r_p)$ measured by using 3022 galaxies with robust spectroscopic redshifts in two
independent fields (COSMOS and VVDS-02h) covering in total 0.8 deg$^2$. We quantify how the scale
dependent clustering amplitude $r_0$ changes with redshift making use of mock samples to evaluate
and correct the survey selection function. Using a power-law model $\xi(r) = (r/r_0)^{-\gamma}$
we find that the correlation function for the general population is best fit by a model with a clustering
length $r_0$=3.95$^{+0.48}_{-0.54}$ h$^{-1}$Mpc and slope $\gamma$=1.8$^{+0.02}_{-0.06}$
at $z$~2.5, $r_0$=4.35$\pm$0.60 h$^{-1}$Mpc and $\gamma$=1.6$^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$ at $z$~3.5.
We use these clustering parameters to derive the large-scale linear galaxy bias $b_L^{PL}$, between
galaxies and dark matter. We find $b_L^{PL}$ = 2.68$\pm$0.22 at redshift $z$~3 (assuming $\sigma_8$
= 0.8), significantly higher than found at intermediate and low redshifts. We fit an HOD model to
the data and we obtain that the average halo mass at redshift $z$~3 is $M_h$=10$^{11.75\pm0.23}$
h$^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$. From this fit we confirm that the large-scale linear galaxy bias is relatively
high at $b_L^{HOD}$ = 2.82$\pm$0.27. Comparing these measurements with similar measurements
at lower redshifts we infer that the star-forming population of galaxies at $z$~3 should evolve
into the massive and bright ($M_r$<-21.5) galaxy population which typically occupy haloes
of mass $\langle M_h\rangle$ = 10$^{13.9}$ h$^{-1}$ $M_{\odot}$ at redshift $z$=0.
