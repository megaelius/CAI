Through the years numerous attempts have been made to connect the phenomenology and physics of mass
accretion onto stellar-mass and super-massive black holes in a scale-invariant fashion. In this
paper, we explore this connection at the radiatively-efficient (and non-jetted) end of accretion
modes by comparing the relationship between the luminosity of the accretion disk and corona in the
two source classes. We analyse 458 RXTE-PCA archival observations of the X-ray binary (XRB) GX339-4
focusing on the soft and soft-intermediate states, which have been suggested to be analogous to
radiatively efficient AGN. The observed scatter in the $\log L_{disk}-\log L_{corona}$ relationship
of GX339-4 is high ($\sim0.43\,$dex) and significantly larger than in a representative sample
of radiatively-efficient, non- or weakly-jetted AGN ($\sim0.30\,$dex). On the face of it, this
would appear contrary to the hypothesis that the systems simply scale with mass. On the other hand
we also find that GX339-4 and our AGN sample show different $\dot{m}$ and $\Gamma$ distributions,
with the latter being broader in GX339-4 (dispersion of $\sim0.16$ cf. $\sim0.08$ for AGN). GX339-4
also shows an overall softer slope, with mean $\sim2.20$ as opposed to $\sim2.07$ for the AGN sample.
Remarkably, once similarly broad $\Gamma$ and $\dot{m}$ distributions are selected, the AGN sample
overlaps nicely with GX339-4 observations in the mass-normalised $\log L_{disk}-\log L_{corona}$
plane, with a scatter of $\sim0.30-0.33\,$dex. This indicates that a mass-scaling of properties
might hold after all, with our results being consistent with the disk-corona systems in AGN and XRBs
exhibiting the same physical processes, albeit under different conditions for instance in terms
of temperature, optical depth and/or electron energy distribution in the corona, heating-cooling
balance, coronal geometry and/or black hole spin.
