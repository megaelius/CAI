Context: Occultations of stars by asteroids are an efficient method to study the properties of minor
bodies, and can be exploited as tools to derive very precise asteroid astrometry relative to the
target star. With the availability of stellar astrometry thanks to the ESA mission Gaia, the frequency
of good predictions and the quality of the astrometry have been strongly enhanced. Aims: Our goal
is to evaluate the astrometric performance of a systematic exploitation of stellar occultations,
with a homogeneous data set and a given instrument setup. As a reference instrument, we adopt the
example of a robotic 50 cm telescope, which is under construction at the Observatoire de la C\^ote
d Azur. We focus in particular on single chord occultations. Methods: We created a data set of simulated
light curves, that are modelled by a Bayesian approach. To build the final statistics, we considered
a list of predicted events over a long time span, and stellar astrometry from Gaia data release 2.
Results: We derive an acceptable range of observability of the events, with clear indications of
the expected errors in terms of timing uncertainties. By converting the distribution of such errors
to astrometric uncertainties, we show that the precision on a single chord can reach levels equivalent
to the performance of Gaia (sub milli arcseconds). The errors on the asteroid position are dominated
by the uncertainty on the position of the occultation chord with respect to the barycentre of the
object. Conclusions: The limiting factor in the use of occultation astrometry is not the light curve
uncertainty, but our knowledge of the shape and size of the asteroid. This conclusion is valid in
a wide range of flux drops and magnitudes of the occulted star. The currently increasing knowledge
of the shape, spin properties, and size, must be used to mitigate this source of error.
