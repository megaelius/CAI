Modelling the turbulent diffusion of thermal energy, momentum, and metals is required in all galaxy
evolution simulations due to the ubiquity of turbulence in galactic environments. The most commonly
employed diffusion model, the Smagorinsky model, is known to be over-diffusive due to its strong
dependence on the fluid velocity shear. We present a method for dynamically calculating a more accurate,
locally appropriate, turbulent diffusivity: the dynamic localised Smagorinsky model. We investigate
a set of standard astrophysically-relevant hydrodynamical tests, and demonstrate that the dynamic
model curbs over-diffusion in non-turbulent shear flows and improves the density contrast in our
driven turbulence experiments. In galactic discs, we find that the dynamic model maintains the
stability of the disc by preventing excessive angular momentum transport, and increases the metal-mixing
timescale in the interstellar medium. In both our isolated Milky Way-like galaxies and cosmological
simulations, we find that the interstellar and circumgalactic media are particularly sensitive
to the treatment of turbulent diffusion. We also examined the global gas enrichment fractions in
our cosmological simulations, to gauge the potential effect on the formation sites and population
statistics of Population III stars and supermassive black holes, since they are theorised to be
sensitive to the metallicity of the gas out of which they form. The dynamic model is, however, not
for galaxy evolution studies only. It can be applied to all astrophysical hydrodynamics simulations,
including those modelling stellar interiors, planetary formation, and star formation.
