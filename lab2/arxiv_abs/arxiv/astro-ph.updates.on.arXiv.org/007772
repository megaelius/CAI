A deep understanding of the Milky Way galaxy, its formation and evolution requires observations
of huge numbers of stars. Stellar photometry, therefore, provides an economical method to obtain
intrinsic stellar parameters. With the addition of distance information - deriving reliable ages
from photometry is a possibility. We have developed a Bayesian method that generates 2D probability
maps of a star's age and metallicity from photometry and parallax using isochrones. Our synthetic
tests show that including a near-UV passband enables us to break the degeneracy between a star's
age and metallicity for certain evolutionary stages. It is possible to find well-constrained ages
and metallicities for turn-off and sub-giant stars with colours including a U band and a parallax
with uncertainty less than ~20%. Metallicities alone are possible for the main sequence and giant
branch. We find good agreement with the literature when we apply our method to the Gaia benchmark
stars, particularly for turn-off and young stars. Further tests on the old open cluster NGC 188,
however, reveal significant limitations in the stellar isochrones. The ages derived for the cluster
stars vary with evolutionary stage, such that turn-off ages disagree with those on the sub-giant
branch, and metallicities vary significantly throughout. Furthermore, the parameters vary appreciably
depending on which colour combinations are used in the derivation. We identify the causes of these
mismatches and show that improvements are needed in the modelling of giant branch stars and in the
creation and calibration of synthetic near-UV photometry. Our results warn against applying isochrone
fitting indiscriminately. In particular, the uncertainty on the stellar models should be quantitatively
taken into account. Further efforts to improve the models will result in significant advancements
in our ability to study the Galaxy.
