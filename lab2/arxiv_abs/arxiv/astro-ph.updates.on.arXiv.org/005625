V923 Sco is a bright ($V$ = 5.91), nearby ($\pi$ = 15.46$\pm$0.40 mas) southern eclipsing binary.
Because both components are slow rotators, the minimum masses of the components are known with 0.2%
precision from spectroscopy. The system seems ideal for very precise mass, radius, and luminosity
determinations and, owing to its proximity and long orbital period ($\sim$ 34.8 days), promises
to be resolved with long-baseline interferometry. The principal aim is very accurate determinations
of absolute stellar parameters for both components of the eclipsing binary and a model-independent
determination of the distance.} New high-precision photometry of both eclipses of V923 Sco with
the MOST satellite was obtained. The system was spatially resolved with the VLTI AMBER, PIONIER,
and GRAVITY instruments at nine epochs. Combining the projected size of the spectroscopic orbit
(in km) and visual orbit (in mas) the distance to the system is derived. Simultaneous analysis of
photometric, spectroscopic, and interferometric data was performed to obtain a robust determination
of the absolute parameters. Very precise absolute parameters of the components were derived in
spite of the parameter correlations. The primary component is found to be overluminous for its mass.
Combining spectroscopic and interferometric observations enabled us to determine the distance
to V923 Sco with better than 0.2% precision, which provides a stringent test of Gaia parallaxes.
It is shown that combining spectroscopic and interferometric observations of nearby eclipsing
binaries can lead to extremely accurate parallaxes and stellar parameters.
