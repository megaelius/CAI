Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are the evolutionary phases of very massive stars prior to the final supernova
explosion stage. These stars lose substantial mass during WN and WC stages. The mass losses are associated
with diverse elemental and isotopic signatures that represent distinct stellar evolutionary
processes. The WR strong winds can host environments for condensation of dust grains with diverse
compositions. The condensation of dust in the outflows of the massive stars is supported by several
observations. The present work is an attempt to develop a theoretical framework of thermodynamics
associated with the condensation of dust grains in the winds of WN and WC phases. A novel numerical
code has been developed for dust condensation. Apart from the equilibrium dust condensation calculations,
we have attempted, perhaps for the first time, a set of non-equilibrium scenarios for dust condensation
in various WR stages. These scenarios differ in terms of the magnitude of the non-equilibrium state,
defined in terms of a simulation non-equilibrium parameter. Here, we attempt to understand the
sensitivity of the simulation non-equilibrium parameter on the condensation sequence of dust
grains. In general, we found that mostly C (graphite), TiC, SiC, AlN, CaS and Fe-metal are condensed
in WR winds. The extent of non-equilibrium influences the relative proportions of earliest dust
condensate compared to the condensates formed at later stages subsequent to the cooling of the gas.
The results indicate that dust grains condensed in the WC phase may substantially contribute carbon-rich
dust grains to the interstellar medium.
