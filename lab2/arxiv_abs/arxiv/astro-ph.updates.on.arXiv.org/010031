We utilise mock catalogues from high-accuracy cosmological $N$-body simulations to quantify
shifts in the recovery of the acoustic scale that could potentially result from galaxy clustering
bias. The relationship between galaxies and dark matter halos presents a complicated source of
systematic errors in modern redshift surveys, particularly when aiming to make cosmological measurements
to sub-percent precision. Apart from a scalar, linear bias parameter accounting for the density
contrast ratio between matter tracers and the true matter distribution, other types of galaxy bias,
such as assembly and velocity biases, may also significantly alter clustering signals from small
to large scales. We create mocks based on generalised halo occupation populations of 36 periodic
boxes from the \abacuscosmos release with. In a total volume of $48 \, h^{-3} \mathrm{Gpc}^3$, we
test various biased models along with an unbiased base case. Two reconstruction methods are applied
to galaxy samples and the apparent acoustic scale is derived by fitting the two-point correlation
function multipoles. With respect to the baseline, we find a $0.3\%$ shift in the line-of-sight
acoustic scale for one variation in the satellite galaxy population, and we find an $0.7\%$ shift
for an extreme level of velocity bias of the central galaxies. All other bias models are consistent
with zero shift at the $0.2\%$ level after reconstruction. We note that the bias models explored
are relatively large variations, producing sizeable and likely distinguishable changes in small-scale
clustering, the modelling of which would further calibrate the BAO standard ruler.
