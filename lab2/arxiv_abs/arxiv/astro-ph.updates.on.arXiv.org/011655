The distribution of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) is currently explored at
low-z by means of UV spectroscopy of quasars. We propose an alternative approach based on UV colours
of quasars as observed from GALEX surveys. We built a NUV-selected sample of 9033 quasars with (FUV-NUV)
colours. The imprint of HI absorption in the observed colours is suggested qualitatively by their
distribution as a function of quasar redshift. Because broad band fluxes lack spectral resolution
and are sensitive to a large range of N_HI a Monte Carlo simulation of IGM opacity is required for quantitative
analysis. It was performed with absorbers randomly distributed along redshift and column density
distributions, assumed to be a broken power law with index beta1 (10^15 < N_HI <10^17.2 cm^-2) and
beta2 (10^17.2 < N_HI <10^19 cm^-2). The redshift distribution is proportional to the redshift
evolution law of the number density of Lyman limit systems (LLS) per unit redshift as determined
by spectroscopic surveys.The simulation is run with different assumptions on the spectral index
alpha_nu of the quasar ionising flux. The fits between the simulated and observed distribution
of colours require an LLS redshift density larger than that derived from spectroscopic counting.
This result is robust in spite of difficulties in determining the colour dispersion other than that
due to HI absorption. We provide arguments to retain alpha_nu = - 2, a value already extreme with respect
to those measured with HST/COS. Further fitting of power law index beta1 and beta2 leads to a higher
density by a factor of 1.7 (beta1 = -1.7, beta2 = -1.5), possibly 1.5 (beta1 = -1.7, beta2 = -1.7). Beyond
the result in terms of density the analysis of UV colours of quasars reveals a tension between the
current description of IGM opacity at low z and the published average ionising spectrum of quasars.
