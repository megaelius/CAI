In the context of secular evolution, we describe the dynamics of the radiative core of low-mass stars
to understand the internal transport of angular momentum in such stars which results in a solid rotation
in the Sun from 0.7R_sun to 0.2R_sun and a weak radial core-envelope differential rotation in solar-type
stars. This study requires at least a 2D description to capture the latitudinal variations of the
differential rotation. We build 2D numerical models of a radiative core on the top of which we impose
a latitudinal shear so as to reproduce a cylindrical differential rotation in a convective envelope.
We perform a systematic study over the Rossby number measuring the latitudinal differential rotation
at the radiative-convective interface. The imposed shear generates a geostrophic flow implying
a cylindrical differential rotation. When compared to the baroclinic flow that arises from the
stable stratification, we find that the geostrophic flow is dominant when the Rossby number is high
enough with a cylindrical rotation profile. For low Rossby numbers, the baroclinic solution dominates
with a quasi-shellular rotation profile. Using scaling laws from 3D simulations, we show that slow
rotators are expected to have a cylindrical rotation profile. Fast rotators may have a shellular
profile at the beginning of the main-sequence in stellar radiative zones. This study enables us
to predict different types of differential rotation and emphasizes the need of a new generation
of 2D rotating stellar models developed in synergy with 3D numerical simulations. The shear induced
by a surface convective zone has a strong impact on the dynamics of the underlying radiative zone
in low-mass stars. But, it cannot produce a flat internal rotation profile in a solar configuration
calling for additional processes for the transport of angular momentum in both radial and latitudinal
directions.
