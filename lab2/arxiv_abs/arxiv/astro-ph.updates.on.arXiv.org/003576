Before an exoplanet transit, atmospheric refraction bends light into the line of sight of an observer.
The refracted light forms a stellar mirage, a distorted secondary image of the host star. I model
this phenomenon and the resultant out-of-transit flux increase across a comprehensive exoplanetary
parameter space. At visible wavelengths, Rayleigh scattering limits the detectability of stellar
mirages in most exoplanetary systems with semi-major axes $\lesssim$6 AU. A notable exception
is almost any planet orbiting a late M or ultra-cool dwarf star at $\gtrsim$0.5 AU, where the maximum
relative flux increase is greater than 50 parts-per-million. Based partly on previous work, I propose
that the importance of refraction in an exoplanet system is governed by two angles: the orbital distance
divided by the stellar radius and the total deflection achieved by a ray in the optically thin portion
of the atmosphere. Atmospheric lensing events caused by non-transiting exoplanets, which allow
for exoplanet detection and atmospheric characterization, are also investigated. I derive the
basic formalism to determine the total signal-to-noise ratio of an atmospheric lensing event,
with application to Kepler data. It is unlikely that out-of-transit refracted light signals are
clearly present in Kepler data due to Rayleigh scattering and the bias toward short-period exoplanets.
However, observations at long wavelengths (e.g., the near-infrared) are significantly more likely
to detect stellar mirages. Lastly, I discuss the potential for the Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite to detect refracted light and consider novel science cases enabled by refracted light
spectra from the James Webb Space Telescope.
