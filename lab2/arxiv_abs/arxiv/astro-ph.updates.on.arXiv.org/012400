We present an initial study of one of the first ALMA Band 3 observations of the Sun with the aim to characterise
the diagnostic potential of brightness temperatures measured with ALMA on the Sun. The observation
covers 48min at a cadence of 2s targeting a Quiet Sun region at disk-centre. Corresponding time series
of brightness temperature maps are constructed with the first version of the Solar ALMA Pipeline
(SoAP) and compared to simultaneous SDO observations. The angular resolution of the observations
is set by the synthesized beam (1.4x2.1as). The ALMA maps exhibit network patches, internetwork
regions and also elongated thin features that are connected to large-scale magnetic loops as confirmed
by a comparison with SDO maps. The ALMA Band 3 maps correlate best with the SDO/AIA 171, 131 and 304
channels in that they exhibit network features and, although very weak in the ALMA maps, imprints
of large-scale loops. A group of compact magnetic loops is very clearly visible in ALMA Band 3. The
brightness temperatures in the loop tops reach values of about 8000-9000K and in extreme moments
up to 10 000K. ALMA Band 3 interferometric observations from early observing cycles already reveal
temperature differences in the solar chromosphere. The weak imprint of magnetic loops and the correlation
with the 171, 131, and 304 SDO channels suggests though that the radiation mapped in ALMA Band 3 might
have contributions from a larger range of atmospheric heights than previously assumed but the exact
formation height of Band 3 needs to be investigated in more detail. The absolute brightness temperature
scale as set by Total Power measurements remains less certain and must be improved in the future.
Despite these complications and the limited angular resolution, ALMA Band 3 observations have
large potential for quantitative studies of the small-scale structure and dynamics of the solar
chromosphere.
