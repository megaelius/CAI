The rare CI carbonaceous chondrites are the most aqueously altered and chemically primitive meteorites
but due to their porous nature and high abundance of volatile elements are susceptible to terrestrial
weathering. The Ivuna meteorite, type specimen for the CI chondrites, is the largest twentieth-century
CI fall and least affected by terrestrial alteration. The main mass of Ivuna (BM2008 M1) has been
stored in a nitrogen atmosphere at least since 2008 and is the most pristine CI chondrite stone. We
report the mineralogy, petrography and bulk elemental composition of BM2008 M1 and a second Ivuna
stone (BM1996 M4) stored in air. Both Ivuna stones are breccias consisting of multiple rounded,
phyllosilicate-rich clasts formed through aqueous alteration followed by impact processing.
A polished thin section of BM2008 M1 analysed immediately after preparation was found to contain
sulphate-bearing veins formed when primary sulphides reacted with oxygen and atmospheric water.
A section of BM1996 M4 lacked veins but had sulphate grains on the surface recently formed (last 6
years). Differences in the extent of terrestrial alteration recorded by BM2008 M1 and BM1996 M4
probably reflect variations in the post-recovery curation history of the stones before entering
the NHM collection, and indicate that where possible pristine samples of hydrated carbonaceous
should be kept out of the terrestrial environment in a stable environment to avoid modification.
The bulk elemental composition of the two Ivuna stones show some variability due to their heterogeneous
nature but in general are similar to previous analyses of CI chondrites. We combine our elemental
abundances with literature values to calculate a new average composition for the Ivuna meteorite,
which is in good agreement with existing compilations of CI chondrites and the most recent solar
photospheric abundances.
