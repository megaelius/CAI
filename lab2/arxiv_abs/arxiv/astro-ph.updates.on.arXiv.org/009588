We examine the co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes in the Simba cosmological
hydrodynamic simulation. Simba grows black holes via gravitational torque-limited accretion
from cold gas and Bondi accretion from hot gas, while feedback from black holes is modeled in radiative
and jet modes depending on the Eddington ratio ($f_{Edd}$). Simba shows generally good agreement
with local studies of black hole properties, such as the black hole mass--stellar velocity dispersion
($M_{BH}-\sigma$) relation, 2 the black hole accretion rate vs. star formation rate (BHAR--SFR),
and the black hole mass function. $M_{BH}-\sigma$ evolves such that galaxies at a given $M_{BH}$
have higher $\sigma$ at higher redshift, consistent with no evolution in $M_{BH}-M_*$. For $M_{BH}<\sim
10^8 M_\odot$, $f_{Edd}$ is anti-correlated with $M_{BH}$ since the BHAR is approximately independent
of $M_{BH}$, while at higher masses $f_{Edd}-M_{BH}$ flattens and has a larger scatter. BHAR vs.
SFR is invariant with redshift, but $f_{Edd}$ drops steadily with time at a given $M_{BH}$, such
that all but the most massive black holes are accreting in a radiatively efficient mode at $z>\sim
2$. The black hole mass function amplitude decreases with redshift and is locally dominated by quiescent
galaxies for $M_{BH}>10^{8}M_{\odot}$, but for $z>\sim 1$ star forming galaxies dominate at all
$M_{BH}$. The $z=0$ $f_{Edd}$ distribution is roughly lognormal with a peak at $f_{Edd}<\sim 0.01$
as observed, shifting to higher $f_{Edd}$ at higher redshifts. Finally, we study the dependence
of black hole properties with \HI\ content and find that the correlation between gas content and
star formation rate is modulated by black hole properties, such that higher SFR galaxies at a given
gas content have smaller black holes with higher $f_{Edd}$
