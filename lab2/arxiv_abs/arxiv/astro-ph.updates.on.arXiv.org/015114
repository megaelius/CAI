Cool evolved stars are known to be significant contributors to the enrichment of the interstellar
medium through their dense and dusty stellar winds. High resolution observations of these outflows
have shown them to possess high degrees of morphological complexity. We observed the asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) star EP Aquarii with ALMA in band 6 and VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL in four filters the visible.
Both instruments had an angular resolution of 0.025''. These are follow-up observations to the
lower-resolution 2016 ALMA analysis of EP Aquarii, which revealed that its wind possesses a nearly
face-on, spiral-harbouring equatorial density enhancement, with a nearly pole-on bi-conical
outflow. At the base of the spiral, the SiO emission revealed a distinct emission void approximately
0.4'' to the west of the continuum brightness peak, which was proposed to be linked to the presence
of a companion. The new ALMA data better resolve the inner wind and reveal that its morphology as observed
in CO is consistent with hydrodynamical companion-induced perturbations. Assuming that photodissociation
by the UV-field of the companion is responsible for the emission void in SiO, we deduced the spectral
properties of the tentative companion from the size of the hole. We conclude that the most probable
companion candidate is a white dwarf with a mass between 0.65 and 0.8 Msol , though a solar-like companion
could not be definitively excluded. The radial SiO emission shows periodic, low-amplitude perturbations.
We tentatively propose that they could be the consequence of the interaction of the AGB wind with
another much closer low-mass companion. The polarised SPHERE/ZIMPOL data show a circular signal
surrounding the AGB star with a radius of 0.1''...
