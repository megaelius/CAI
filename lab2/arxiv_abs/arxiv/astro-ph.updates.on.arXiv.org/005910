We present observations of two strong-lensing galaxy clusters located within the $90$ per cent
credible sky localization released following LIGO-Virgo's discovery of the binary black hole
(BBH) source GW170814. Our objectives were (1) to search for candidate electromagnetic (EM) counterparts
to this source under the hypothesis that it was strongly-lensed and thus more distant and less massive
than inferred by LIGO-Virgo, and (2) to demonstrate the feasibility of rapid target of opportunity
observations to search for faint lensed transient point sources in crowded cluster cores located
within GW sky localizations. Commencing 20 hours after discovery, and continuing over 12 nights,
we observed Abell 3084 ($z=0.22$) and SMACSJ0304.3$-$4401 ($z=0.46$) with GMOS on the Gemini-South
telescope, and Abell 3084 with MUSE on ESO's Very Large Telescope. Careful analysis, and calibration
of our methods using simulations, yield $5\sigma$ detection limits on transients in difference
images of the cores of these clusters of 25th magnitude for continuum emission, and $5\times10^{-17}{\rm
erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$ for line emission. This is the first emission-line search for optical
counterparts to GW sources, and the most sensitive continuum search to date - we reach an apparent
magnitude limit before correction for lens magnification that is more than $\sim\,2$ magnitudes
fainter than previous searches. Moreover, we show that the lens magnification suffered by GW sources
cancels the inverse square law, and therefore our observations are uniformly sensitive to lensed
sources across the full range of redshifts at which stellar-mass binary compact objects are credible
LIGO-Virgo sources.
