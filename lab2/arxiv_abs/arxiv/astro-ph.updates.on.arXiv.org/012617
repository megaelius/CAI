Aim. We investigate the role of PAHs as a sink for deuterium in the interstellar medium and study UV
photolysis as a potential process in the variations of the deuterium fractionation in the ISM. Methods.
The UV photo-induced fragmentation of various isotopologues of D-enriched, protonated anthracene
and phenanthrene ions was recorded in a FTICR mass spectrometer. IRMPD spectroscopy using FELIX
provided the IR spectra that were compared to DFT vibrational spectra; reaction barriers and rates
were also calculated and related to the product abundances. Results. The mass spectra for both UV
and IRMPD photolysis show the loss of H from [D-C$_{14}$H$_{10}$]$^+$, whereas [H-C$_{14}$D$_{10}$]$^+$
shows a strong preference for D loss. Calculations reveal facile 1,2-H and -D shift reactions, with
barriers lower than the energy supplied by the photo-excitation process. Together with confirmation
of the ground-state structures via the IR spectra, we determined that the photolytic processes
in the 2 PAHs are largely governed by scrambling where the H and the D atoms relocate between different
peripheral C atoms. The $\sim$0.1 eV difference in zero-point energy between C-H and C-D bonds ultimately
leads to faster H scrambling than D scrambling, and increased H atom loss compared to D. Conclusion.
Scrambling is common in PAH cations under UV radiation. Upon photoexcitation of deuterium-enriched
PAHs, the scrambling results in a higher probability for the aliphatic D atom to migrate to an aromatic
site, protecting it from elimination. This could lead to increased deuteration as a PAH moves towards
more exposed interstellar environments. Also, large, compact PAHs with an aliphatic C-HD group
on solo sites might be responsible for the majority of aliphatic C-D stretching bands seen in astronomical
spectra.
