The detailed evolution of exoplanetary atmospheres has been the subject of decade-long studies.
Only recently, investigations began on the possible atmospheric mass loss caused by the activity
of galactic central engines. This question has so far been explored without using available exoplanet
data. The goal of this paper is to improve our knowledge of the erosion of exoplanetary atmospheres
through radiation from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) undergoing an active galactic nucleus
(AGN) phase. To this end, we extended the well-known energy-limited mass-loss model to include
the case of radiation from AGNs. We set the fraction of incident power $\epsilon$ available to heat
the atmosphere as either constant ($\epsilon = 0.1$) or flux dependent ($\epsilon = \epsilon(F_{\textrm{XUV}})$).
We calculated the possible atmospheric mass loss for 54 known exoplanets (of which 16 are hot Jupiters
residing in the Galactic bulge and 38 are Earth-like planets (EPs)) due to radiation from the Milky
Way's (MW) central SMBH, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), and from a set of 107,220 AGNs generated using the
33,350 AGNs at $z < 0.5$ of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey database. We found that planets in the Galactic
bulge might have lost up to several Earth atmospheres in mass during the AGN phase of Sgr A*, while
the EPs are at a safe distance from Sgr A* ($> 7$ kpc) and have not undergone any atmospheric erosion
in their lifetimes. We also found that the MW EPs might experience a mass loss up to $\sim 15$ times
the Mars atmosphere over a period of $50$ Myr as the result of exposure to the cumulative extreme-UV
flux $F_{\textrm{XUV}}$ from the AGNs up to $z = 0.5$. In both cases we found that an incorrect choice
of $\epsilon$ can lead to significant mass loss overestimates.
