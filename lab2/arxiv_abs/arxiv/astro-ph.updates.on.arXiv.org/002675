We present a new method for inferring the metallicity (Z) and ionization parameter (q) of HII regions
and star-forming galaxies using strong nebular emission lines (SEL). We use Bayesian inference
to derive the joint and marginalized posterior probability density functions for Z and q given a
set of observed line fluxes and an input photo-ionization model. Our approach allows the use of arbitrary
sets of SELs and the inclusion of flux upper limits. The method provides a self-consistent way of
determining the physical conditions of ionized nebulae that is not tied to the arbitrary choice
of a particular SEL diagnostic and uses all the available information. Unlike theoretically calibrated
SEL diagnostics the method is flexible and not tied to a particular photo-ionization model. We describe
our algorithm, validate it against other methods, and present a tool that implements it called IZI.
Using a sample of nearby extra-galactic HII regions we assess the performance of commonly used SEL
abundance diagnostics. We also use a sample of 22 local HII regions having both direct and recombination
line (RL) oxygen abundance measurements in the literature to study discrepancies in the abundance
scale between different methods. We find that oxygen abundances derived through Bayesian inference
using currently available photo-ionization models in the literature can be in good (~30%) agreement
with RL abundances, although some models perform significantly better than others. We also confirm
that abundances measured using the direct method are typically 0.2 dex lower than both RL and photo-ionization
model based abundances.
