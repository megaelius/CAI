Gamma-ray binaries are systems composed of a massive star and a compact object that exhibit emission
from radio to very high energy gamma rays. They are ideal laboratories to study particle acceleration
and a variety of physical processes that vary as a function of the orbital phase. We aim to study the
radio emission of the gamma-ray binary 1FGL J1018.6-5856 to constrain the emitting region and determine
the peculiar motion of the system within the Galaxy to clarify its origin by analyzing an observation
with the Australian Long Baseline Array at 8.4~GHz. We combined these data with the optical Gaia
DR2 and UCAC4 catalogs to consolidate the astrometry information therein. 1FGL J1018.6-5856 shows
compact radio emission ($< 3$ mas or $\lesssim 20$ au at $\sim 6.4$ kpc distance), implying a brightness
temperature of $\gtrsim 5.6 \times 10^6$ K, and confirming its nonthermal origin. We report consistent
results between the proper motion reported by Gaia DR2 and the positions obtained from the Gaia,
UCAC4, and LBA data. We also determined the distance to 1FGL J1018.6-5856 to be $6.4_{-0.7}^{+ 1.7}$
kpc. Together with the radial velocity of the source we computed its three-dimensional proper and
peculiar motion within the Galaxy. We obtained a peculiar motion on its regional standard of rest
(RSR) frame of $|u| = 45_{-9}^{+30}$ km s$^{-1}$, with the system moving away from the Galactic plane.
In the simplest scenario of a symmetric stellar core collapse we estimate a mass loss of $ 4 \lesssim
\Delta M \lesssim 9$ M$_{\odot}$ during the creation of the compact object. 1FGL J1018.6-5856 exhibits
compact radio emission similar to that detected in other gamma-ray binaries. We provide the first
accurate peculiar motion estimations of the system and place it within the Galaxy. The obtained
motion and distance excludes its physical relation with the supernova remnant G284.3-1.8.
