Global-scale Rossby waves have recently been unambiguously identified on the Sun. Here we study
the latitude and depth dependence of the Rossby wave eigenfunctions. By applying helioseismic
ring-diagram analysis and granulation tracking to SDO/HMI observations, we compute maps of the
radial vorticity of flows in the upper solar convection zone (down to depths of more than $16$ Mm).
We use a Fourier transform in longitude to separate the different azimuthal orders m in the range
$3 \le m \le 15$. At each $m$ we obtain the phase and amplitude of the Rossby waves as a function of depth
using the helioseismic data. At each $m$ we also measure the latitude dependence of the eigenfunctions
by calculating the covariance between the equator and other latitudes. We then study the horizontal
and radial dependences of the radial vorticity eigenfunctions. The horizontal eigenfunctions
are complex. As observed previously, the real part peaks at the equator and switches sign near $\pm
30^\circ$, thus the eigenfunctions show significant non-sectoral contributions. The imaginary
part is smaller than the real part. The phase of the radial eigenfunctions varies by only roughly
$\pm 5^\circ$ over the top $15$ Mm. The amplitude of the radial eigenfunctions decreases by about
$10\%$ from the surface down to $8$ Mm (the region where ring-diagram analysis is most reliable,
as seen by comparing with the rotation rate measured by global-mode seismology). The radial dependence
of the radial vorticity eigenfunctions deduced from ring-diagram analysis is consistent with
a power-law down to $8$ Mm and is unreliable at larger depths. However, the observations provide
only weak constraints on the power-law exponents. For the real part, the latitude dependence of
the eigenfunctions is consistent with previous work (using granulation tracking). The imaginary
part is smaller than the real part but significantly nonzero.
