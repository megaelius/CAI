We predict the evolution of giant clumps undergoing star-driven outflows in high-z gravitationally
unstable disk galaxies. We find that the mass loss is expected to occur through a steady wind over
many tens of free-fall times (t_ff ~ 10 Myr) rather than by an explosive disruption in one or a few t_ff.
Our analysis is based on the finding from simulations that radiation trapping is negligible because
it destabilizes the wind (Krumholz & Thompson 2012, 2013). Each photon can therefore contribute
to the wind momentum only once, so the radiative force is limited to L/c. When combining radiation,
protostellar and main-sequence winds, and supernovae, we estimate the total direct injection
rate of momentum into the outflow to be 2.5 L/c. The adiabatic phase of supernovae and main-sequence
winds can double this rate. The resulting outflow mass-loading factor is of order unity, and if the
clumps were to deplete their gas the timescale would have been a few disk orbital times, to end with
half the original clump mass in stars. However, the clump migration time to the disk center is on the
order of an orbital time, about 250 Myr, so the clumps are expected to complete their migration prior
to depletion. Furthermore, the clumps are expected to double their mass in a disk orbital time by
accretion from the disk and clump-clump mergers, so their mass actually grows in time and with decreasing
radius. From the 6-7 giant clumps with observed outflows, 5 are consistent with these predictions,
and one has a much higher mass-loading factor and momentum injection rate. The latter either indicates
that the estimated outflow is an overestimate (within the 1-sigma error), that the SFR has dropped
since the time when the outflow was launched, or that the driving mechanism is different, e.g. supernova
feedback in a cavity generated by the other feedbacks.
