We present an explicit detailed theoretical and observational investigation of the anisotropic
massive Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, which is characterized
by the two additional degrees of freedom; the BD parameter, $\omega$, and the present day value of
the density parameter corresponding to the shear scalar, $\Omega_{\sigma^2,0}$. The BD parameter
$\omega$, being the measure of the deviation from general theory of relativity (GR), by alone characterizes
both the dynamical behaviour of the effective dark energy (DE) and the redshift dependence of the
shear scalar. These two affect each other depending on $\omega$, such that the shear scalar contributes
to the dynamics of the effective DE and its anisotropic stress -- which is not exist in scalar field
models of DE within GR -- controls the dynamics of the shear scalar, in particular, the deviations
from its usual $(1+z)^6$ form in GR. We mainly confine the current work to non-negative $\omega$
values as it is the right sign -- theoretically and observationally -- for investigating the model
as a correction to $\Lambda$CDM. By considering current cosmological observations, we find that
$\omega\gtrsim 250$ and $\Omega_{\sigma^2,0} \lesssim 10^{-23}$ and conclude that the contribution
of the anisotropy of the effective DE to this value is quite insignificant, namely, led to only a few
percent stronger upper bound value. We also point out the interesting features of the model in the
case of negative $\omega$ values; for instance, the constraints on $\Omega_{\sigma^2,0}$ could
be relaxed considerably, the values of $\omega\sim-1$ (relevant to string theories) predict dramatically
different dynamics for the expansion anisotropy.
