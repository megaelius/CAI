We present the discovery of KELT-22Ab, a hot Jupiter from the KELT-South survey. KELT-22Ab transits
the moderately bright ($V\sim 11.1$) Sun-like G2V star TYC 7518-468-1. The planet has an orbital
period of $P = 1.3866529 \pm 0.0000027 $ days, a radius of $R_{P} = 1.285_{-0.071}^{+0.12}~R_{J}$,
and a relatively large mass of $M_{P} = 3.47_{-0.14}^{+0.15}~ M_{J}$. The star has $R_{\star} =
1.099_{-0.046}^{+0.079}~ R_{\odot}$, $M_{\star} = 1.092_{-0.041}^{+0.045}~ M_{\odot}$,
${T_{\rm eff}\,} = 5767_{-49}^{+50}~$ K, ${\log{g_\star}} = 4.393_{-0.060}^{+0.039}~$ (cgs),
and [m/H] = $+0.259_{-0.083}^{+0.085}~$, and thus, other than its slightly super-solar metallicity,
appears to be a near solar twin. Surprisingly, KELT-22A exhibits kinematics and a Galactic orbit
that are somewhat atypical for thin disk stars. Nevertheless, the star is rotating quite rapidly
for its estimated age, shows evidence of chromospheric activity, and is somewhat metal rich. Imaging
reveals a slightly fainter companion to KELT-22A that is likely bound, with a projected separation
of 6\arcsec ($\sim$1400 AU). In addition to the orbital motion caused by the transiting planet,
we detect a possible linear trend in the radial velocity of KELT-22A suggesting the presence of another
relatively nearby body that is perhaps non-stellar. KELT-22Ab is highly irradiated (as a consequence
of the small semi-major axis of $a/R_{\star} = 4.97$), and is mildly inflated. At such small separations,
tidal forces become significant. The configuration of this system is optimal for measuring the
rate of tidal dissipation within the host star. Our models predict that, due to tidal forces, the
semi-major axis of KELT-22Ab is decreasing rapidly, and is thus predicted to spiral into the star
within the next Gyr.
