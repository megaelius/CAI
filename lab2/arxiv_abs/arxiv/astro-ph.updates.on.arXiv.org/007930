The recent hypothesis of a giant supercluster binary-like structure formed by the Corona Borealis
and its close companion Abell 2142 (supercluster) belongs to a little known area of investigation
as the dynamics of gravitationally interacting galaxy supercluster pairs. From the observational
point of view this structure approximates the configuration of a binary-like system in linear orbit
interconnected by a huge filamentary structure which, if confirmed, it would be the first case to
date observed at z > 0.07. Given the importance to disentangle this issue, a follow-up analysis has
been performed on the region constrained by the common envelop of the two superclusters in order
to search for new hints to confirm their mutual gravitational interaction. Observational signatures
of that interaction have been found mapping the inner peculiar motions where the observed negative
peculiar velocities measured within the A2142 (supercluster) region suggest a general matter
flow toward the Corona Borealis supercluster. Besides, analyzing the effects on both superclusters
due to the mutual impact of the external tidal forces, turns out that their inner dynamics remain
unperturbed up to the turnaround radii. Outside, where the binding forces are overlapped by the
tidal ones, the outskirts of both superclusters should be unstable and subject to fragmentation.
Such a scenario indicates that both superclusters interact with comparable and reciprocal tidal
perturbations leaving the whole system in a substantial dynamical equilibrium. The origin of such
a dynamical dichotomy would be explained either by a much more massive Corona Borealis supercluster
than that estimated in the present work or by a selection effect biasing the small sample of peculiar
velocities due to the remoteness of the system worsened by the large uncertainty on their measurements.
