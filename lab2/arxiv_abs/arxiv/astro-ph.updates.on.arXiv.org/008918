The EDGES collaboration reported the finding of an unexpectedly deep absorption in the radio background
at 78~MHz based on their low-band observations, and interpreted the dip as a first detection of redshifted
21-cm from Cosmic Dawn. We have attempted an alternate analysis, adopting a maximally smooth function
approach to model the foreground. A joint fit to the spectrum using such a function together with
a flattened absorption profile yields a best fit absorption amplitude of $921 \pm 35$~mK with full
width $19.2 \pm 0.2$~MHz centered at $78.2 \pm 0.1$~MHz. The depth of the 21-cm absorption inferred
by the EDGES analysis required invoking non-standard cosmology at Cosmic Dawn and this tension
between interpretation of their data and accepted models is compounded by our analysis that suggests
absorption of greater depth. Alternatively, the measured spectrum may be equally-well fit assuming
that there exists a residual unmodeled systematic sinusoidal feature with 12~MHz period and peak
amplitude 60~mK, which leads to the option of avoiding the discordance between the deep and flattened
absorption with more accepted astrophysical cosmology by assuming that such a sinusoidal systematic
exists in the spectrum, which has escaped their calibrations. We explore this possibility further
by examining for any additional redshifted 21-cm signal in the data. The data then favors an absorption
with Gaussian model parameters of amplitude $133$~mK, best width at half-power $9$~MHz and center
frequency $72.5$~MHz. We also examine the consistency of the measured spectrum with plausible
redshifted 21-cm models: a set of 3 of the 265 profiles in the global 21-cm atlas of \cite{2017MNRAS.472.1915C}
are favored by the spectrum. We conclude that the EDGES data may be consistent with standard cosmology
and astrophysics, without invoking excess radio backgrounds or baryon-dark matter interactions.
