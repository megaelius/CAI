Broad-line Ic supernovae (SNe Ic-BL) are a very rare class of core-collapse supernovae exhibiting
high ejecta velocities and high kinetic energies. They are the only type of SNe that accompany long
gamma-ray burst (GRB) explosions. Systematic differences found in the spectra of SNe Ic-BL with
and without GRBs (GRB-SNe and SNe Ic-BL, respectively) suggest that either the progenitor or/and
explosion mechanism of SNe Ic-BL with and without a GRB differ, or the difference could be only due
to the viewing angle of the observer with respect to the orientation of the collimated explosion.
We present the systematic comparison of the host galaxies of broad-lined SNe Ic with and without
a detected GRB, the latter being detected in untargeted surveys, with the aim to find out whether
there are any systematic differences between the environments in which these two classes of SNe
preferentially explode. We study photometric properties of the host galaxies of a sample of 8 GRB-SNe
and a sample of 28 SNe Ic-BL at z < 0.2. The two galaxy samples have indistinguishable luminosity and
proper size distribution. We find indications that GRB-SNe on average occur closer to the centres
of their host galaxies, i.e. the samples have a different distribution of projected offsets, normalized
by the galaxy sizes. In addition we compare gas-phase metallicities of the GRB-SNe and SNe Ic-BL
host samples and find that a larger fraction of super-solar metallicity hosts are found among the
SNe Ic-BL without a GRB. Our results are indicative of a genuine difference between the two types
of explosions and suggest that the viewing angle is not the main source of difference in the spectra
of the two classes. We discuss the implications our results have on our understanding of progenitors
of SNe Ic-BL with and without a GRB.
