The stellar density profile a galaxy is typically summarised with two numbers: total stellar mass
and half-light radius. The total mass of a galaxy, however, is not a well-defined quantity, due to
the finite depth of photometric observations and the arbitrariness of the distinction between
galaxy and diffuse intra-group light. This limits our ability to make accurate comparisons between
models and observations. I wish to provide a more robust two-parameter description of the stellar
density distribution of elliptical galaxies, in terms of quantities that can be measured unambiguously.
I propose to use the stellar mass enclosed within 10 kpc in projection, $M_{*,10}$, and the mass-weighted
stellar density slope within the same aperture, $\Gamma_{*,10}$, for this purpose. I measured
the distribution in $M_{*,10}$ and $\Gamma_{*,10}$ of a sample of elliptical galaxies from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey, using photometry from the Hyper
Suprime-Cam survey. The pair of values of $(M_{*,10},\Gamma_{*,10})$ can be used to predict the
stellar density profile in the inner 10 kpc of a galaxy with better than 20% accuracy. Similarly,
$M_{*,10}$ and $\Gamma_{*,10}$ can be combined to obtain a proxy for stellar velocity dispersion
at least as good as the stellar mass fundamental plane. As a first application, I then compared the
observed $M_{*,10}-\Gamma_{*,10}$ relation of elliptical galaxies with that of similarly selected
galaxies in the EAGLE Reference simulation. Observed and simulated galaxies match at $M_{*,10}=10^{11}M_\odot$,
but the EAGLE $M_{*,10}-\Gamma_{*,10}$ relation is shallower and has a larger intrinsic scatter
compared to observations. This new parameterisation of the stellar density profile of massive
elliptical galaxies provides a more robust way of comparing results from different photometric
surveys and from hydrodynamical simulations.
