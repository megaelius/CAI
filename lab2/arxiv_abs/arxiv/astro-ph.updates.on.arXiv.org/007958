Dwarf novae (DNe) and X-ray binaries exhibit outbursts thought to be due to a thermal-viscous instability
in the accretion disk. The disk instability model (DIM) assumes that accretion is driven by turbulent
transport, customarily attributed to the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). Recent results
point out that MRI turbulence alone fails to reproduce the light curves of DNe. We aim to study the
impact of wind-driven accretion on the light curves of DNe. Local and global simulations show that
magneto-hydrodynamic winds are present when a magnetic field threads the disk, even for relatively
high ratios of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure ($\beta \approx 10^{5}$). These winds are
very efficient in removing angular momentum but do not heat the disk; they do not behave as MRI-driven
turbulence. We add wind-driven transport in the angular momentum equation of the DIM, assuming
a fixed magnetic configuration: dipolar or constant with radius. We use prescriptions for the wind
torque and the turbulent torque derived from shearing box simulations. The wind torque enhances
the accretion of matter, resulting in light curves that look like DNe outbursts when assuming a dipolar
field with a moment $\mu\approx10^{30}\,\mathrm{G\,cm^{3}}$. In the region where the wind dominates,
the disk is cold, optically thin and the accretion speed is sonic. This acts as if the inner disk was
truncated, leading to higher quiescent X-ray luminosities from the white dwarf boundary layer
than expected with the standard DIM. The disk is stabilized if the wind-dominated region is large
enough, potentially leading to `dark' disks emitting little radiation. Wind-driven accretion
can play a key role in shaping the light curves of DNe and X-ray binaries. Future studies will need
to include the time evolution of the magnetic field threading the disk to fully assess its impact
on the dynamics of the accretion flow.
