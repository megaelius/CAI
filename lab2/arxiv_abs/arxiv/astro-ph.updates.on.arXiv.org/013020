The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale acts as a standard ruler for measuring cosmological
distances and has therefore emerged as a leading probe of cosmic expansion history. However, any
physical effect that alters the length of the ruler can lead to a bias in our determination of distance
and expansion rate. One of these physical effects is the streaming velocity, the relative velocity
between baryons and dark matter in the early Universe, which couples to the BAO scale due to their
common origin in acoustic waves at recombination. In this work, we investigate the impact of streaming
velocity on the BAO feature of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest auto-power spectrum, one of the main tracers
being used by the recently commissioned DESI spectrograph. To do this, we develop a new perturbative
model for Lyman-$\alpha$ flux density contrast which is complete to second order for a certain set
of fields, and applicable to any redshift-space tracer of structure since it is based only on symmetry
considerations. We find that there are 8 biasing coefficients through second order. We find streaming
velocity-induced shifts in the BAO scale of 0.081--0.149% (transverse direction) and 0.053--0.058%
(radial direction), depending on the model for the biasing coefficients used. These are smaller
than, but not negligible compared to, the DESI Lyman-$\alpha$ BAO error budget, which is 0.46% on
the overall scale. The sensitivity of these results to our choice of bias parameters underscores
the need for future work to measure the higher-order biasing coefficients from simulations, especially
for future experiments beyond DESI.
