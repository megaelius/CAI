Gravitational wave and electromagnetic observations can provide new insights into the nature
of matter at supra-nuclear densities inside neutron stars. Improvements in electromagnetic and
gravitational wave sensing instruments continue to enhance the accuracy with which they can measure
the masses, radii, and tidal deformability of neutron stars. These better measurements place tighter
constraints on the equation of state of cold matter above nuclear density. In this article, we discuss
a complementary approach to get insights into the structure of neutron stars by providing a model
prediction for non-linear fundamental eigenmodes (f-modes) and their decay over time, which are
thought to be induced by time-dependent tides in neutron star binaries. Building on pioneering
studies that relate the properties of f-modes to the structure of neutron stars, we systematically
study this link in the non-perturbative regime using models that utilize numerical relativity.
Using a suite of fully relativistic numerical relativity simulations of oscillating TOV stars,
we establish blueprints for the numerical accuracy needed to accurately compute the frequency
and damping times of f-mode oscillations, which we expect to be a good guide for the requirements
in the binary case. We show that the resulting f-mode frequencies match established results from
linear perturbation theory, but the damping times within numerical errors depart from linear predictions.
This work lays the foundation for upcoming studies aimed at a comparison of theoretical models of
f-mode signatures in gravitational waves, and their uncertainties with actual gravitational
wave data, searching for neutron star binaries on highly eccentric orbits, and probing neutron
star structure at high densities.
