Recent observational and theoretical studies of classical Be stars have established the utility
of polarization color diagrams (PCD) in helping to constrain the time-dependent mass decretion
rates of these systems. We expand on our pilot observational study of this phenomenon, and report
the detailed analysis of a long-term (1989-2004) spectropolarimetric survey of 9 additional classical
Be stars, including systems exhibiting evidence of partial disk-loss/disk-growth episodes as
well as systems exhibiting long-term stable disks. After carefully characterizing and removing
the interstellar polarization along the line of sight to each of these targets, we analyze their
intrinsic polarization behavior. We find that many steady-state Be disks pause at the top of the
PCD, as predicted by theory. We also observe sharp declines in the Balmer jump polarization for later
spectral type, near edge-on steady-state disks, again as recently predicted by theory, likely
caused when the base density of the disk is very high, and the outer region of the edge-on disk starts
to self absorb a significant number of Balmer jump photons. The intrinsic $V$-band polarization
and polarization position angle of $\gamma$ Cas exhibits variations that seem to phase with the
orbital period of a known one-armed density structure in this disk, similar to the theoretical predictions
of Halonen & Jones. We also observe stochastic jumps in the intrinsic polarization across the
Balmer jump of several known Be+sdO systems, and speculate that the thermal inflation of part of
the outer region of these disks could be responsible for producing this observational phenomenon.
Finally, we estimate the base densities of this sample of stars to be between $\approx 8\times 10^{-11}$
to $\approx 4 \times 10^{-12}\,\rm g cm^{-3}$ during quasi steady state periods given there maximum
observed polarization.
