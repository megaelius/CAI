Upcoming ground-based cosmic microwave background experiments will provide CMB maps with high
sensitivity and resolution that can be used for high fidelity lensing reconstruction. However,
the sky coverage will be incomplete and the noise highly anisotropic, so optimized estimators are
required to extract the most information from the maps. We focus on quadratic-estimator based lensing
reconstruction methods that are fast to implement, and compare new more-optimally filtered estimators
with various estimators that have previously been used in the literature. Input CMB maps can be optimally
inverse-signal-plus-noise filtered using conjugate gradient (or other) techniques to account
for the noise anisotropy. However, lensing reconstructions from these filtered input maps have
an anisotropic response to the lensing signal and are difficult to interpret directly. We describe
a second-stage filtering of the lensing maps and analytic response model that can be used to construct
lensing power spectrum estimates that account for the anisotropic response and noise inhomogeneity
in an approximately optimal way while remaining fast to compute. We compare results for simulations
of upcoming Simons Observatory and CMB Stage-4 experiments to show the robustness of the more optimal
lensing reconstruction pipeline and quantify the improvement compared to less optimal estimators.
We find a substantial improvement in reconstructed lensing power variance between optimal anisotropic
and isotropic filtering of CMB maps, and up to 30% improvement in variance by using the additional
filtering step on the reconstruction potential map. Our approximate analytic response model is
unbiased to within a small percent-level additional Monte Carlo correction.
