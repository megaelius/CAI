On 2018 Feb. 4.41, the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) discovered ASASSN-18bt
in the K2 Campaign 16 field. With a redshift of $z=0.010981$ and a peak apparent magnitude of $B_{max}=14.31$,
ASASSN-18bt is the nearest and brightest SNe Ia yet observed by the Kepler spacecraft. Here we present
the discovery of ASASSN-18bt, the K2 light curve, and pre-discovery data from ASAS-SN and the Asteroid
Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). The K2 early-time light curve has an unprecedented
cadence and photometric precision for an SN Ia light curve, and it unambiguously shows a 4 day nearly
linear phase followed by a steeper rise. Thus, ASASSN-18bt joins a growing list of SNe Ia whose early
light curves are not well described by a single power law. We show that a double-power-law model fits
the data reasonably well, hinting that two physical processes must be responsible for the observed
rise. However, we find that current models of the interaction with a non-degenerate companion predict
an abrupt rise and cannot adequately explain the initial, slower linear phase. Instead, we find
that existing, published models with shallow $^{56}$Ni are able to span the observed behavior and,
with tuning, may be able to reproduce the ASASSN-18bt light curve. Regardless, more theoretical
work is needed to satisfactorily model this and other early-time SNe~Ia light curves. Finally,
we use Swift X-ray non-detections to constrain the presence of CSM at much larger distances and lower
densities than possible with the optical light curve. Assuming a wind-like environment, the observed
X-ray limit corresponds to a mass-loss limit of $\dot M<\rm{8 \times 10^{-6}}\,\rm{M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$
for $v_\textrm{w}=100\,\rm{km\,s^{-1}}$, ruling out some symbiotic progenitor systems.
