Despite recent observational efforts, unequivocal signs for the presence of intermediate-mass
black holes (IMBHs) in globular clusters (GCs) have not been found yet. Especially when the presence
of IMBHs is constrained through dynamical modeling of stellar kinematics, it is fundamental to
account for the displacement that the IMBH might have with respect to the GC centre. In this paper
we analyse the IMBH wandering around the stellar density centre using a set of realistic direct N-body
simulations of star cluster evolution. Guided by the simulation results, we develop a basic yet
accurate model that can be used to estimate the average IMBH radial displacement ($\left<r_\mathrm{bh}\right>$)
in terms of structural quantities as the core radius ($r_\mathrm{c}$), mass ($M_\mathrm{c}$),
and velocity dispersion ($\sigma_\mathrm{c}$), in addition to the average stellar mass ($m_\mathrm{c}$)
and the IMBH mass ($M_\mathrm{bh}$). The model can be expressed by the equation $\left<r_\mathrm{bh}\right>/r_\mathrm{c}=A(m_\mathrm{c}/M_\mathrm{bh})^\alpha[\sigma_\mathrm{c}^2r_\mathrm{c}/(GM_\mathrm{c})]^\beta$,
in which the free parameters $A,\alpha,\beta$ are calculated through comparison with the numerical
results on the IMBH displacement. The model is then applied to Galactic GCs, finding that for an IMBH
mass equal to 0.1% of the GC mass, the typical expected displacement of a putative IMBH is around $1''$
for most Galactic GCs, but IMBHs can wander to larger angular distances in some objects, including
a prediction of a $2.5''$ displacement for NGC 5139 ($\omega$ Cen), and $>10''$ for NGC 5053, NGC
6366 and ARP2.
