We aim to take a census of molecular hydrogen emission line objects (MHOs) in the Rho Ophiuchi molecular
cloud and to make the first systematic proper motion measurements of these objects in this region.
Deep H2 near-infrared imaging is performed to search for molecular hydrogen emission line objects.
Multi-epoch data are used to derive the proper motions of the features of these objects, and the lengths
and opening angles of the molecular hydrogen outflows. Our imaging covers an area of about 0.11 deg2
toward the L1688 core in the Rho Ophiuchi molecular cloud. In total, six new MHOs are discovered,
32 previously known MHOs are detected, and the proper motions for 86 features of the MHOs are measured.
The proper motions lie in the range of 14 to 247 mas/yr, corresponding to transversal velocities
of 8 to 140 km s-1 with a median velocity of about 35 km s-1. Based on morphology and proper motion measurements,
27 MHOs are ascribed to 21 driving sources. The molecular hydrogen outflows have a median length
of about 0.04 pc and random orientations. We find no obvious correlation between H2 jet length, jet
opening angle, and the evolutionary stage of the driving sources as defined by their spectral indices.
We find that the fraction of protostars (23%) that drive molecular hydrogen outflows is similar
to the one for Class II sources (15%). For most molecular hydrogen outflows, no obvious velocity
variation along the outflow has been found. In Ophiuchus the frequency of occurrence of molecular
hydrogen outflows has no strong dependency on the evolutionary stage of the driving source during
the evolution from the protostellar stage to the classical T Tauri stage.
