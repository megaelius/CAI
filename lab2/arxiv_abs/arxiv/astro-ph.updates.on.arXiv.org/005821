The last decade has witnessed a steadily increasing number of observational studies concerning
the rare class of radio loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, of which several hundred are currently
known. According to the current AGN paradigm, the low black hole masses and high accretion rates
of narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1) should make them unlikely to launch jets, and indeed the
vast majority ($\sim 90\%$) are very radio weak. The remainder, however, display a wide range of
radio power, from $\simeq 10^{21}$- $10^{28}$ W/Hz. In this review I discuss recent radio imaging
surveys that suggest there are three main classes of NLSy1, which cannot be easily distinguished
by the standard radio-loudness parameter alone: (i) radio-weak NLSy1s without jets, (ii) mildly
radio-loud NLSy1s that are a mixture of star-forming and jet-dominant AGN, and (iii) very radio
loud NLSy1s with extreme properties similar to powerful jet-dominated blazars. I present updated
kinematics information from the MOJAVE survey on six of the latter sources (all detected in gamma-rays
by Fermi), indicating high bulk Lorentz factors and small viewing angles in three cases. Studies
with the JVLA have shown that the jets of radio loud NLSy1s are likely lower- power versions of classical
radio galaxies, with typical lengths of less than 10 kpc, although two very radio-loud NLSy1s have
de-projected sizes of several hundred kpc. I discuss the challenges of reconciling the heterogeneous
radio properties of NLSy1s with their strict optical line criteria, and near-term prospects for
the discovery of larger numbers of radio-loud NLSy1s.
