It has been suggested that IC4499 is one of the very few old globulars to not host multiple populations
with light-element variations. To follow-up on this very interesting result, here we make use of
accurate HST photometry and FLAMES@VLT high-resolution spectroscopy to investigate in more detail
the stellar population properties of this system. We find that the red giant branch of the cluster
is clearly bimodal in near-UV -- optical colour-magnitude diagrams, thus suggesting that IC4499
is actually composed by two sub-populations of stars with different nitrogen abundances. This
represents the first detection of multiple populations in IC4499. Consistently, we also find that
one star out of six is Na-rich to some extent, while we do not detect any evidence of intrinsic spread
in both Mg and O. The number ratio between stars with normal and enriched nitrogen is in good agreement
with the number ratio - mass trend observed in Galactic globular clusters. Also, as typically found
in other systems, nitrogen rich stars are more centrally concentrated than normal stars, although
this result cannot be considered conclusive because of the limited field of view covered by our observations
(~$1r_h$). On the contrary, we observe that both the RGB UV color spread, which is a proxy of N variations,
and Na abundance variations, are significantly smaller than those observed in Milky Way globular
clusters with mass and metallicity comparable to IC4499. The modest N and Na spreads observed in
this system can be tentatively connected to the fact that IC4499 likely formed in a disrupted dwarf
galaxy orbiting the Milky Way, as previously proposed based on its orbit.
