We study the effects of the integrated galactic initial mass function (IGIMF) and dust evolution
on the abundance patterns of starburst galaxies at high redshift. In our chemical models, the rapid
collapse of gas clouds triggers an intense and rapid star formation episode, which lasts until the
onset of a galactic wind, powered by the thermal energy injected by stellar winds and supernova explosions.
Our models follow the evolution of several chemical elements (C, N, $\alpha$-elements and Fe) both
in the gas and dust phases. %The most recent stellar yield and dust prescriptions are adopted. We
test different values of $\beta$, the slope of the embedded cluster mass function for the IGIMF,
where lower $\beta$ values imply a flatter slope and a more top-heavy initial mass function (IMF).
The predicted abundances are compared to high-quality abundance measurements obtained in lensed
galaxies and from composite spectra in large samples of star-forming galaxies in the redshift range
$2 \lesssim z \lesssim 3$. The adoption of the IGIMF causes a sensible increase of the rate of star
formation with respect to a standard Salpeter IMF, with a strong impact on chemical evolution. We
find that in order to reproduce the observed abundance patterns in these galaxies, either we need
a very top-heavy IGIMF ($\beta < 2$) or large amounts of dust. In particular, if dust is important,
the IGIMF should have $\beta \ge 2$, which means an IMF slightly more top-heavy than the Salpeter
one. The evolution of the dust mass with time for galaxies of different mass and IMF is also predicted,
highlighting that dust amount increases with top-heavier IGIMF.
