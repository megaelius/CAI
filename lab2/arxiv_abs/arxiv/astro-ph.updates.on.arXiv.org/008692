Two key areas of emphasis in contemporary experimental exoplanet science are the detailed characterization
of transiting terrestrial planets, and the search for Earth analog planets to be targeted by future
imaging missions. Both of these pursuits are dependent on an order-of-magnitude improvement in
the measurement of stellar radial velocities (RV), setting a requirement on single-measurement
instrumental uncertainty of order 10 cm/s. Achieving such extraordinary precision on a high-resolution
spectrometer requires thermo-mechanically stabilizing the instrument to unprecedented levels.
Here, we describe the Environment Control System (ECS) of the NEID Spectrometer, which will be commissioned
on the 3.5 m WIYN Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory in 2019, and has a performance specification
of on-sky RV precision < 50 cm/s. Because NEID's optical table and mounts are made from aluminum,
which has a high coefficient of thermal expansion, sub-milliKelvin temperature control is especially
critical. NEID inherits its ECS from that of the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF), but with modifications
for improved performance and operation near room temperature. Our full-system stability test
shows the NEID system exceeds the already impressive performance of HPF, maintaining vacuum pressures
below $10^{-6}$ Torr and an RMS temperature stability better than 0.4 mK over 30 days. Our ECS design
is fully open-source; the design of our temperature-controlled vacuum chamber has already been
made public, and here we release the electrical schematics for our custom Temperature Monitoring
and Control (TMC) system.
