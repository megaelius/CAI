Measurements of the physical properties of stars at the lower end of the main sequence are scarce.
In this context we report masses, radii and surface gravities of ten very-low-mass stars in eclipsing
binary systems, with orbital periods of the order of several days. The objects probe the stellar
mass-radius relation in the fully convective regime, $M_\star \lesssim 0.35$ M$_\odot$, down
to the hydrogen burning mass-limit, $M_{\mathrm{HB}} \sim 0.07$ M$_\odot$. The stars were detected
by the WASP survey for transiting extra-solar planets, as low-mass, eclipsing companions orbiting
more massive, F- and G-type host stars. We use eclipse observations of the host stars (TRAPPIST,
Leonhard Euler, SPECULOOS telescopes), and radial velocities of the host stars (CORALIE spectrograph),
to determine physical properties of the low-mass companions. Companion surface gravities are
derived from the eclipse and orbital parameters of each system. Spectroscopic measurements of
the host star effective temperature and metallicity are used to infer the host star mass and age from
stellar evolution models. Masses and radii of the low-mass companions are then derived from the
eclipse and orbital parameters of each system. The objects are compared to stellar evolution models
for low-mass stars, to test for an effect of the stellar metallicity and orbital period on the radius
of low-mass stars in close binary systems. Measurements are in good agreement with stellar models;
an inflation of the radii of low-mass stars with respect to model predictions is limited to 1.6 $\pm$
1.2% in the fully convective regime. The sample of ten objects indicates a scaling of the radius of
low-mass stars with the host star metallicity. No correlation between stellar radii and orbital
periods of the binary systems is determined. A combined analysis with comparable objects from the
literature is consistent with this result.
