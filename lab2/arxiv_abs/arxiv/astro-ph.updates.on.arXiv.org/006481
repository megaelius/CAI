We use deep multi-epoch near-IR images of the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) Survey to measure
proper motions (PMs) of stars in the Milky Way globular cluster FSR1716 = VVV-GC05. The color-magnitude
diagram of this object, made using PM selected members, shows an extended horizontal branch, nine
confirmed RR Lyrae members in the instability strip, and possibly several hotter stars extending
to the blue. Based on the fundamental-mode (ab-type) RR Lyrae stars that move coherently with the
cluster, we confirmed that FSR1716 is an Oosterhoff I globular cluster with a mean period Pab = 0.574
days. Intriguingly, we detect tidal extensions to both sides of this cluster in the spatial distribution
of PM selected member stars. Also, one of the confirmed RRabs is located 11 arcmin in projection from
the cluster center, suggesting that FSR1716 may be losing stars due to the gravitational interaction
with the Galaxy. We also measure radial velocities (RVs) for five cluster red giants selected using
the PMs. The combination of RVs and PMs allow us to compute for the first time the orbit of this globular
cluster, using an updated Galactic potential. The orbit results to be confined within |Zmax | < 2.0
kpc, and has eccentricity 0.4 < e < 0.6, with perigalactic distance 1.5 < Rperi (kpc) < 2.3, and apogalactic
distance 5.3 < Rapo (kpc) < 6.4. We conclude that, in agreement with its relatively low metallicity
([Fe/H]= -1.4 dex), this is an inner halo globular cluster plunging into the disk of the Galaxy. As
such, this is a unique object to test the dynamical processes that contribute to the disruption of
Galactic globular clusters.
