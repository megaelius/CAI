We present a new, open source, free semi-analytic model (SAM) of galaxy formation, Shark, designed
to be highly flexible and modular, allowing easy exploration of different physical processes and
ways of modelling them. We introduce the philosophy behind Shark and provide an overview of the physical
processes included in the model. Shark is written in C++11 and has been parallelized with OpenMP.
In the released version (v1.1), we implement several different models for gas cooling, active galactic
nuclei, stellar and photo-ionisation feedback, and star formation (SF). We demonstrate the basic
performance of Shark using the Planck15 cosmology SURFS simulations, by comparing against a large
set of observations, including: the stellar mass function (SMF) and stellar-halo mass relation
at z=0-4; the cosmic evolution of the star formation rate density (SFRD), stellar mass, atomic and
molecular hydrogen; local gas scaling relations; and structural galaxy properties, finding excellent
agreement. Significant improvements over previous SAMs are seen in the mass-size relation for
disks/bulges, the gas-stellar mass and stellar mass-metallicity relations. To illustrate the
power of Shark in exploring the systematic effects of the galaxy formation modelling, we quantify
how the scatter of the SF main sequence and the gas scaling relations changes with the adopted SF law,
and the effect of the starbursts H$_2$ depletion timescale on the SFRD and $\Omega_{\rm H_2}$. We
compare Shark with other SAMs and the hydrodynamical simulation EAGLE, and find that SAMs have a
much higher halo baryon fractions due to large amounts of intra-halo gas, which in the case of EAGLE
is in the intergalactic medium.
