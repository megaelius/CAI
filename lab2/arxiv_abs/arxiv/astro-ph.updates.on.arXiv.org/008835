NGC 6402 is among the most massive globular clusters in the Galaxy, but little is known about its detailed
chemical composition. Therefore, we obtained radial velocities and/or chemical abundances of
11 elements for 41 red giant branch cluster members using high resolution spectra obtained with
the Magellan-M2FS instrument. We find NGC 6402 to be only moderately metal-poor with $\langle$[Fe/H]$\rangle$
= $-$1.13 dex ($\sigma$ = 0.05 dex) and to have a mean heliocentric radial velocity of $-$61.1 km s$^{\rm
-1}$ ($\sigma$ = 8.5 km s$^{\rm -1}$). In general, NGC 6402 exhibits mean composition properties
that are similar to other inner Galaxy clusters, such as [$\alpha$/Fe] $\sim$ $+$0.3 dex, [Cr,Ni/Fe]
$\sim$ 0.0 dex, and $\langle$[La/Eu]$\rangle$ = $-$0.08 dex. Similarly, we find large star-to-star
abundance variations for O, Na, Mg, Al, and Si that are indicative of gas that experienced high temperature
proton-capture burning. Interestingly, we detect three distinct populations, but also find large
gaps in the [O/Fe], [Na/Fe], and [Al/Fe] distributions that may provide the first direct evidence
of delayed formation for intermediate composition stars. A qualitative enrichment model is discussed
where clusters form stars through an early ($<$ 5$-$10 Myr) phase, which results in first generation
and "extreme" composition stars, and a delayed phase ($>$ 40 Myr), which results in the dilution
of processed and pristine gas and the formation of intermediate composition stars. For NGC 6402,
the missing intermediate composition stars suggest the delayed phase terminated prematurely,
and as a result the cluster may uniquely preserve details of the chemical enrichment process.
