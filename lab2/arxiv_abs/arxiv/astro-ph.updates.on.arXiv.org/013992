About 10% of stars more massive than ${\approx}\,1.5\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ have strong, large-scale
surface magnetic fields and are being discussed as progenitors of highly-magnetic white dwarfs
and magnetars. The origin of these fields remains uncertain. Recent 3D magnetohydrodynamical
simulations have shown that strong magnetic fields can be generated in the merger of two massive
stars. Here, we follow the long-term evolution of such a 3D merger product in a 1D stellar evolution
code. During a thermal relaxation phase after the coalescence, the merger product reaches critical
surface rotation, sheds mass and then spins down primarily because of internal mass readjustments.
The spin of the merger product after thermal relaxation is mainly set by the co-evolution of the star-torus
structure left after coalescence. This evolution is still uncertain, so we also consider magnetic
braking and other angular-momentum-gain and -loss mechanisms that may influence the final spin
of the merged star. Because of core compression and mixing of carbon and nitrogen in the merger, enhanced
nuclear burning drives a transient convective core that greatly contributes to the rejuvenation
of the star. Once the merger product relaxed back to the main sequence, it continues its evolution
similar to that of a genuine single star of comparable mass. It is a slow rotator that matches the magnetic
blue straggler $\tau$ Sco. Our results show that merging is a promising mechanism to explain some
magnetic massive stars and it may also be key to understand the origin of the strong magnetic fields
of highly-magnetic white dwarfs and magnetars.
