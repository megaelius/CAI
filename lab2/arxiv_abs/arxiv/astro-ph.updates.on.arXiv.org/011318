We report the discovery of PSR J2251$-$3711, a radio pulsar with a spin period of 12.1 seconds, the
second longest currently known. It has a spin period derivative of $1.31 \times 10^{-14}~\mathrm{s~s}^{-1}$,
corresponding to a characteristic surface magnetic field of $1.3 \times 10^{13}$ G and a spin-down
luminosity of $2.9 \times 10^{29}~\mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}$. Its dispersion measure of 12.12(1)
$\mathrm{pc}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ leads to distance estimates of 0.5 and 1.3 kpc according to the
NE2001 and YMW16 Galactic free electron density models, respectively. Some of its single pulses
show an uninterrupted 180 degree sweep of the phase-resolved polarization position angle, with
an S-shape reminiscent of the rotating vector model prediction. However, the fact that this sweep
occurs at different phases from one pulse to another is remarkable and without straightforward
explanation. Although PSR J2251$-$3711 lies in the region of the $P-\dot{P}$ parameter space occupied
by the X-ray Isolated Neutron Stars (XINS) and some low-magnetic field magnetars, there is no evidence
for an X-ray counterpart in our Swift XRT observation; this places a 99%-confidence upper bound
on its unabsorbed bolometric thermal luminosity of $1.1 \times 10^{31}~(d / 1~\mathrm{kpc})^2~\mathrm{erg/s}$
for an assumed blackbody temperature of 85 eV, where $d$ is the distance to the pulsar. We discuss
plausible evolution history scenarios for this source, but further observations are needed to
determine whether it is a rotation-powered pulsar with a true age of at least several Myr, or a much
younger object such as an XINS or a recently cooled magnetar. Extreme specimens like PSR J2251-3711
help bridge populations in the so-called neutron star zoo in an attempt to understand their origins
and evolution.
