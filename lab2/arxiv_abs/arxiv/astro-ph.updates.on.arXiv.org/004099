Various solar features can be seen on maps of the Sun in the mm and sub-mm wavelength range. The recently
installed Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is capable of observing the Sun
in that wavelength range with an unprecedented spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. To interpret
solar observations with ALMA the first important step is to compare ALMA maps with simultaneous
images of the Sun recorded in other spectral ranges. First we identify different structures in the
solar atmosphere seen in the optical, IR and EUV parts of the spectrum (quiet Sun (QS), active regions
(AR), prominences on the disc, magnetic inversion lines (IL), coronal holes (CH) and coronal bright
points (CBPs)) in a full disc solar ALMA image. The second aim is to measure the intensities (brightness
temperatures) of those structures and compare them with the corresponding QS level. A full disc
solar image at 1.21 mm obtained on December 18, 2015 during a CSV-EOC campaign with ALMA is calibrated
and compared with full disc solar images from the same day in H\alpha, in He I 1083 nm core, and with
SDO images (AIA at 170 nm, 30.4 nm, 21.1 nm, 19.3 nm, and 17.1 nm and HMI magnetogram). The brightness
temperatures of various structures are determined by averaging over corresponding regions of
interest in the ALMA image. Positions of the QS, ARs, prominences on the disc, ILs, CHs and CBPs are
identified in the ALMA image. At 1.21 mm ARs appear as bright areas (but sunspots are dark), while
prominences on the disc and CHs are not discernible from the QS background, although having slightly
less intensity than surrounding QS regions. ILs appear as large, elongated dark structures and
CBPs correspond to ALMA bright points. These results are in general agreement with sparse earlier
measurements at similar wavelengths. The identification of CBPs represents the most important
new result.
