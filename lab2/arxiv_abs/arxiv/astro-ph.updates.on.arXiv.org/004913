Low-mass low-density planets discovered by Kepler in the super-Earth mass regime typically have
large radii for their inferred masses, implying the presence of H$_2$-He atmospheres. These planets
are vulnerable to atmospheric mass loss due to heating by the parent star's XUV flux. Models coupling
atmospheric mass loss with thermal evolution predicted a bimodal distribution of planetary radii,
which has gained observational support. However, a key component that has been ignored in previous
studies is the dissolution of these gases into the molten core of rock and iron that constitute most
of their mass. Such planets have high temperatures ($>$2000 K) and pressures ($\sim$kbars) at the
core-envelope boundary, ensuring a molten surface and a subsurface reservoir of hydrogen that
can be 5-10 times larger than the atmosphere. This study bridges this gap by coupling the thermal
evolution of the planet and the mass loss of the atmosphere with the thermodynamic equilibrium between
the dissolved H$_2$ and the atmospheric H$_2$ (Henry's law). Dissolution in the interior allows
a planet to build a larger hydrogen repository during the planet formation stage. We show that the
dissolved hydrogen outgasses to buffer atmospheric mass loss. The slow cooling of the planet also
leads to outgassing because solubility decreases with decreasing temperature. Dissolution of
hydrogen in the interior therefore increases the atmosphere retention ability of super-Earths.
The study highlights the importance of including the temperature- and pressure-dependent solubility
of gases in magma oceans and coupling outgassing to planetary evolution models.
