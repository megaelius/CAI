We report a Hitomi observation of IGR J16318-4848, a high-mass X-ray binary system with an extremely
strong absorption of N_H~10^{24} cm^{-2}. Previous X-ray studies revealed that its spectrum is
dominated by strong fluorescence lines of Fe as well as continuum emission. For physical and geometrical
insight into the nature of the reprocessing material, we utilize the high spectroscopic resolving
power of the X-ray microcalorimeter (the soft X-ray spectrometer; SXS) and the wide-band sensitivity
by the soft and hard X-ray imager (SXI and HXI) aboard Hitomi. Even though photon counts are limited
due to unintended off-axis pointing, the SXS spectrum resolves Fe K{\alpha_1} and K{\alpha_2}
lines and puts strong constraints on the line centroid and width. The line width corresponds to the
velocity of 160^{+300}_{-70} km s^{-1}. This represents the most accurate, and smallest, width
measurement of this line made so far from any X-ray binary, much less than the Doppler broadening
and shift expected from speeds which are characteristic of similar systems. Combined with the K-shell
edge energy measured by the SXI and HXI spectra, the ionization state of Fe is estimated to be in the
range of Fe I--IV. Considering the estimated ionization parameter and the distance between the
X-ray source and the absorber, the density and thickness of the materials are estimated. The extraordinarily
strong absorption and the absence of a Compton shoulder component is confirmed. These characteristics
suggest reprocessing materials which are distributed in a narrow solid angle or scattering primarily
with warm free electrons or neutral hydrogen.
