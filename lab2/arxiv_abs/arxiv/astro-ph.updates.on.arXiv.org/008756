We present a far ultraviolet spectroscopic analysis of the slowest known symbiotic nova AG Peg (M3/4III
giant + hot white dwarf; P = 818.4 days) which underwent a nova explosion in 1850 followed by a very
slow decline that did not end until 1996, marking the beginning of quiescence. The 19 years of quiescence
ended in June 2015, when AG Peg exhibited a Z And-type outburst with an optical amplitude of 1.5 magnitudes.
We have carried out accretion disk and WD photosphere synthetic spectral modeling of a Far Ultraviolet
Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) spectrum obtained on June 5.618, 2003 during the quiescence interval
12 years before the 2015 outburst. The spectrum is heavily affected by ISM absorption as well as strong
emission lines. We de-reddened the FUSE fluxes assuming E(B-V) = 0.10, which is the maximum galactic
reddening in the direction of AG Peg. We discuss our adoption of the pre-Gaia distance over the Gaia
parallax. For a range of white dwarf surface gravities and surface temperatures we find that the
best-fitting photosphere is a hot WD with a temperature T = 150,000 K, and a low gravity log(g)~6.0-6.5.
For a distance of 800 pc, the scaled WD radius is about 0.06 Rsun, giving log(g) = 6.67 for a 0.65 Msun
WD mass. The Luminosity we obtain from this model is 1729 Lsun. The hot photosphere models provide
better fits than the accretion disk models which have FUV flux deficits toward the shorter wavelengths
of FUSE, down to the Lyman Limit. Given the uncertainty of the nature of a true symbiotic accretion
disk, and, while a very hot low gravity degenerate star dominates the FUV flux, the presence of a steady-state
(standard) accretion disk cannot be summarily ruled out.
