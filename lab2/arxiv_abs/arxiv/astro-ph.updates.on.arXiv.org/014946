Chemically peculiar (CP) stars of the upper main sequence are characterised by specific anomalies
in the photospheric abundances of some chemical elements. The group of CP2 stars, which encompasses
classical Ap and Bp stars, exhibits strictly periodic light, spectral, and spectropolarimetric
variations that can be adequately explained by the model of a rigidly rotating star with persistent
surface structures and a stable global magnetic field. Using observations from the Kepler K2 mission,
we find that the B9pSi star HD 174356 displays a light curve both variable in amplitude and shape,
which is not expected in a CP2 star. Employing archival and new photometric and spectroscopic observations,
we carry out a detailed abundance analysis of HD 174356 and discuss its photometric and astrophysical
properties in detail. We employ phenomenological modeling to decompose the light curve and the
observed radial velocity variability. Our abundance analysis confirms that HD 174356 is a silicon-type
CP2 star. No magnetic field stronger than 110G was found. The star's light curve can be interpreted
as the sum of two independent strictly periodic signals with P1 = 4.04355(5)d and P2 = 2.11169(3)d.
The periods have remained stable over 17 years of observations. In all spectra, HD 174356 appears
to be single-lined. From the simulation of the variability characteristics and investigation
of stars in the close angular vicinity, we put forth the hypothesis that the peculiar light variability
of HD 174356 arises in a single star and is caused by rotational modulation due to surface abundance
patches (P1) and g mode pulsation (P2).
