The early stages of low-mass star formation are likely to be subject to intense ionization by protostellar
energetic MeV particles. As a result, the surrounding gas is enriched in molecular ions, such as
HCO$^{+}$ and N$_{2}$H$^{+}$. Nonetheless, this phenomenon remains poorly understood for Class
0 objects. Recently, based on Herschel observations taken as part of the key program Chemical HErschel
Surveys of Star forming regions (CHESS), a very low HCO$^{+}$/N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ abundance ratio
of about 3-4, has been reported toward the protocluster OMC-2 FIR4. This finding suggests a cosmic-ray
ionization rate in excess of 10$^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$, much higher than the canonical value of $\zeta$
= 3$\times$10$^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$ (value expected in quiescent dense clouds). To assess the specificity
of OMC-2 FIR4, we have extended this study to a sample of sources in low- and intermediate mass. More
specifically, we seek to measure the HCO$^{+}$/N$_2$H$^{+}$ abundance ratio from high energy
lines (J $\ge$ 6) toward this source sample in order to infer the flux of energetic particles in the
warm and dense gas surrounding the protostars. We use observations performed with the Heterodyne
Instrument for the FarInfrared spectrometer on board the Herschel Space Observatory toward a sample
of 9 protostars. We report HCO$^{+}$/N$_2$H$^{+}$ abundance ratios in the range of 5 up to 73 toward
our source sample. The large error bars do not allow us to conclude whether OMC-2~FIR4 is a peculiar
source. Nonetheless, an important result is that the measured HCO$^{+}$/N$_2$H$^{+}$ ratio does
not vary with the source luminosity. At the present time, OMC-2 FIR4 remains the only source where
a high flux of energetic particles is clearly evident. More sensitive and higher angular resolution
observations are required to further investigate this process.
