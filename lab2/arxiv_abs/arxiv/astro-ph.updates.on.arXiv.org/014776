We study the ultraviolet (UV) emission-line ratios of a sample of 145 type II quasars (QSO2s) from
Sloan Digital Sky Survey III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, and compare against a grid
of active galactic nucleus (AGN) photoionization models with a range in gas density, gas chemical
abundances, and ionization parameter. Most of the quasars are "carbon-loud", with Civ/He ii ratios
that are unusually high for the narrow-line region, implying higher than expected gas density (>10^6
cm^-3) and/or signicantly super-Solar relative carbon abundance. We also find that solar or supersolar
nitrogen abundance and metallicity are required in the majority of our sample, with potentially
significant variation between objects. Compared to radio galaxies at similar redshifts (HzRGs;
z > 2), the QSO2s are offset to higher NV/HeII, CIV/HeII and CIII]/HeII, suggesting systematically
higher gas density and/or systematically higher C and N abundances. We find no evidence for a systematic
difference in the N/C abundance ratio between the two types of objects. Scatter in the NIV]/CIV ratio
implies a significant scatter in the N/C abundance ratio among the QSO2s and HzRGs, consistent with
differences in the chemical enrichment histories between objects. Interestingly, we find that
adopting secondary behaviour for both N and C alleviates the long-standing "NIV] problem". A subset
of the QSO2s and HzRGs also appear to be "silicon-loud", with SiIII] relative fluxes suggesting
Si/C and Si/O are an order of magnitude above their Solar values. Finally, we propose new UV-line
criteria to select genuine QSO2s with low-density narrow-line regions.
