We present Spitzer 3.6$\mu$m and 4.5$\mu$m follow-up of 170 candidate extremely cool brown dwarfs
newly discovered via the combination of WISE and NEOWISE imaging at 3$-$5$\mu$m. CatWISE, a joint
analysis of archival WISE and NEOWISE data, has improved upon the motion measurements of AllWISE
by leveraging a $>$10$\times$ time baseline enhancement, from 0.5 years (AllWISE) to 6.5 years
(CatWISE). As a result, CatWISE motion selection has yielded a large sample of previously unrecognized
brown dwarf candidates, many of which have archival detections exclusively in the WISE 4.6$\mu$m
(W2) channel, suggesting that they could be both exceptionally cold and nearby. Where these objects
go undetected in WISE W1 (3.4$\mu$m), Spitzer can provide critically informative detections at
3.6$\mu$m. Of our motion-confirmed discoveries, seventeen have a best-fit Spitzer [3.6]$-$[4.5]
color most consistent with spectral type Y. CWISEP J144606.62$-$231717.8 ($\mu \approx 1.3''$/yr)
is likely the reddest, and therefore potentially coldest, member of our sample with a very uncertain
[3.6]$-$[4.5] color of 3.71 $\pm$ 0.44 magnitudes. We also highlight our highest proper motion
discovery, WISEA J153429.75$-$104303.3, with $\mu \approx 2.7''$/yr. Given that the prior list
of confirmed and presumed Y dwarfs consists of just 27 objects, the Spitzer follow-up presented
in this work has substantially expanded the sample of identified Y dwarfs. Our new discoveries thus
represent significant progress toward understanding the bottom of the substellar mass function,
investigating the diversity of the Y dwarf population, and selecting optimal brown dwarf targets
for JWST spectroscopy.
