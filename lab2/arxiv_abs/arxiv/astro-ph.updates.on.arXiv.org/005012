We examine the possibility of using near-infrared scattering to constrain the local radiation
field and the dust properties, for example, the size distribution of the grains, and maximum grain
size. We use radiative transfer modelling to examine the constraints provided by J, H, and K bands
in combination with mid-infrared surface brightness at 3.6 $\mu$m. We use a spherical one-dimensional
and elliptical three-dimensional cloud models to study the observable effects of different grain
size distributions with varying absorption and scattering properties. As an example, we analyse
observations of a molecular cloud in Taurus, TMC-1N. The observed surface brightness ratios between
the bands change when the dust properties are changed. However, even a small change of 10% in the surface
brightness of one channel changes the estimated powerlaw exponent of the size distribution $\gamma$
by up to ~30% and the estimated strength of the radiation field K_ISRF by up to ~60%. The maximum grain
size A_max and $\gamma$ are always strongly anti-correlated. For example, overestimating the
surface brightness by 10% changes the estimated radiation field strength by ~20% and the exponent
of the size distribution by ~15%. The analysis of our synthetic observations indicates that the
relative uncertainty of the parameter distributions are on average A_max, $\gamma$ ~25%, and the
deviation between the estimated and correct values $\Delta$ Q <15%. We show that scattered infrared
light can be used to derive meaningful limits for the dust parameters. However, errors in the surface
brightness data can result in considerable uncertainties in the derived parameters.
