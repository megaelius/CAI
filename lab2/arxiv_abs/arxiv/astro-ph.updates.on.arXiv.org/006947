The astronomical J-band (1.25 micrometres) is a relatively untapped wave-band in long-baseline
infrared interferometry. It allows access to the photosphere in giant and super-giant stars relatively
free from opacities of molecular bands. The J-band can potentially be used for imaging spots in the
1350 nm ionised iron line on slowly rotating magnetically-active stars through spectro-interferometry.
In addition, the access to the 1080 nanometres He I line may probe outflows and funnel-flows in T-Tauri
stars and allow the study of the star-disk interaction. We present the progress in the development
of a six-inputs, J-band interferometric beam combiner based on the discrete beam combiner (DBC)
concept. DBCs are periodic arrays of evanescent coupled waveguides which can be used to retrieve
simultaneously the complex visibility of every baseline from a multi-aperture interferometer.
Existing, planned or future interferometric facilities combine or will combine six or more telescopes
at the time, thus increasing the snapshot uv coverage from the interferometric measurements. A
better uv coverage will consequently enhance the accuracy of the image reconstruction. The component
we are currently developing is manufactured in borosilicate glass using the technique of multi-pass
ultrafast laser inscription (ULI), using a mode-locked Yb:KYW laser at the wavelength of 1030 nm,
pulse duration of 300 fs and repetition rate of 1 MHz. After annealing, the written components showed
a propagation loss less than 0.3 dB/cm and a negligible birefringence at a wavelength of 1310 nm,
which makes the components suitable for un-polarized light operation. A single mode fiber-to-component
insertion loss of 0.9 dB was measured. Work is currently in progress to characterize the components
in spectro-interferometric mode with white light covering the J-band spectrum.
