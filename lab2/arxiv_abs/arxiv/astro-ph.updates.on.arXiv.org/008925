We present a multiwavelength study of the OH megamaser galaxy (OHMG) IRAS17526+3253, based on new
Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph Integral Field Unit (GMOS/IFU) observations, Hubble Space
Telescope F814W and H$\alpha$+[N{\sc ii}] images, and archival 2MASS and 1.49GHz VLA data. The
HST images clearly reveal a mid-to-advanced stage major merger whose northwestern and southeastern
nuclei have a projected separation of $\sim$8.5kpc. Our HST/H$\alpha$+[N{\sc ii}] image shows
regions of ongoing star-formation across the envelope on $\sim$10kpc scales, which are aligned
with radio features, supporting the interpretation that the radio emission originates from star-forming
regions. The measured H$\alpha$ luminosities imply that the unobscured star-formation rate is
$\sim$10-30\,M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. The GMOS/IFU data reveal two structures in northwestern
separated by 850\,pc and by a discontinuity in the velocity field of $\sim$~200~km~s$^{-1}$. We
associate the blue-shifted and red-shifted components with, respectively, the distorted disk
of northwestern and tidal debris, possibly a tail originating in southeastern. Star-formation
is the main ionization source in both components, which have SFRs of $\sim$2.6-7.9\,M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$
and $\sim$1.5-4.5\,M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, respectively. Fainter line emission bordering these
main components is consistent with shock ionization at a velocity $\sim$200~km~s$^{-1}$ and may
be the result of an interaction between the tidal tail and the northwestern galaxy's disk. IRAS17526+3253
is one of only a few systems known to host both luminous OH and H$_{2}$O masers. The velocities of the
OH and H$_{2}$O maser lines suggest that they are associated with the northwestern and southeastern
galaxies, respectively.
