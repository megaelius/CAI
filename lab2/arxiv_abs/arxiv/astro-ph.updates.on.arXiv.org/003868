We study a sample of 17 $z>1.5$ C~{\sc i} absorbers observed with the ESO-VLT spectrograph X-SHOOTER.
We derive metallicities, depletion onto dust, extinction by dust and analyse the absorption from
Mg~{\sc ii}, Mg~{\sc i}, Ca~{\sc ii} and Na~{\sc i} that are redshifted into the near infrared wavelength
range. We show that most of them have high metallicity and dust content. We detect 9 Ca~{\sc ii} absorptions
with $W$(Ca~{\sc ii}$\lambda$3934) ~$>$~0.23~\AA~ out of 14 systems where we have appropriate
wavelength coverage. The observed equivalent widths are similar to what has been measured in other
lower redshift surveys of Ca~{\sc ii} systems. We detect 10 Na~{\sc i} absorptions in the 11 systems
where we could observe this absorption. The median equivalent width ($W$(Na~{\sc i}$\lambda$5891)~=~0.68~\AA)
is larger than what is observed in local clouds with similar H~{\sc i} column densities but also in
$z<0.7$ Ca~{\sc ii} systems detected in the SDSS. Most of the systems (12 out of 17) have $W$(Mg~{\sc
ii}$\lambda$2796)~$>$~2.5~\AA~ when six of them have log~$N$(H~{\sc i})~$<$~20.3 with the extreme
case of J1341+1852 which has log~$N$(H~{\sc i})~=~18.18. The Mg~{\sc ii} absorptions are spread
over more than $\Delta v$ $\sim$ 400~km~s$^{-1}$ for half of the systems; three absorbers have $\Delta
v$~$>$~500~km~s$^{-1}$. The kinematics is strongly perturbed for most of these systems which
cannot arise in quiet disks and must be close to regions with intense star formation activity, contrary
to what is usually observed for strong $W > 2$~\AA~ Mg~{\sc ii} systems and/or are part of objects
in interaction. All this suggests that a large fraction of the cold gas at high redshift arises in
disturbed environments.
