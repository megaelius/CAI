The Numerical INJection Analysis (NINJA) project is a collaborative effort between members of
the numerical relativity and gravitational-wave astrophysics communities. The purpose of NINJA
is to study the ability to detect gravitational waves emitted from merging binary black holes and
recover their parameters with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories. We report
here on the results of the second NINJA project, NINJA-2, which employs 60 complete binary black
hole hybrid waveforms consisting of a numerical portion modelling the late inspiral, merger, and
ringdown stitched to a post-Newtonian portion modelling the early inspiral. In a "blind injection
challenge" similar to that conducted in recent LIGO and Virgo science runs, we added 7 hybrid waveforms
to two months of data recolored to predictions of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo sensitivity curves
during their first observing runs. The resulting data was analyzed by gravitational-wave detection
algorithms and 6 of the waveforms were recovered with false alarm rates smaller than 1 in a thousand
years. Parameter estimation algorithms were run on each of these waveforms to explore the ability
to constrain the masses, component angular momenta and sky position of these waveforms. We also
perform a large-scale monte-carlo study to assess the ability to recover each of the 60 hybrid waveforms
with early Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo sensitivity curves. Our results predict that early
Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo will have a volume-weighted average sensitive distance of 300Mpc
(1Gpc) for $10M_{\odot}+10M_{\odot}$ ($50M_{\odot}+50M_{\odot}$) binary black hole coalescences.
We demonstrate that neglecting the component angular momenta in the waveform models used in matched-filtering
will result in a reduction in sensitivity for systems with large component angular momenta. [Abstract
