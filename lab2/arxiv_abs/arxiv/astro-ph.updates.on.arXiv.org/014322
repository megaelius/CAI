Interpreting spectropolarimetric observations of the solar atmosphere takes much longer than
the acquiring the data. The most important reason for this is that the model fitting, or "inversion",
used to infer physical quantities from the observations is extremely slow, because the underlying
models are numerically demanding. We aim to improve the speed of the inference by using a neural network
that relates input polarized spectra to the output physical parameters. We first select a subset
of the data to be interpreted and infer physical quantities from corresponding spectra using a standard
minimization-based inversion code. Taking these results as reliable and representative of the
whole data set, we train a convolutional neural network to connect the input polarized spectra to
the output physical parameters (nodes, in context of spectropolarimetric inversion). We then
apply the neural network to the various other data, previously unseen to the network. As a check,
we apply the referent inversion code to the unseen data and compare the fit quality and the maps of
the inferred parameters between the two inversions. The physical parameters inferred by the neural
network show excellent agreement with the results from the inversion, and are obtained in a factor
of $10^5$ less time. Additionally, substituting the results of the neural network back in the forward
model, shows excellent agreement between inferred and original spectra. The method we present
here is very simple for implementation and extremely fast. It only requires a training data set,
which can be obtained by inverting a representative subset of the observed data. Applying these
(and similar) machine learning techniques will yield orders of magnitude acceleration in the routine
interpretation of spectropolarimetric data.
