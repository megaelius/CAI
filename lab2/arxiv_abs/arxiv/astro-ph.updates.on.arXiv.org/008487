We report the outbursting source PTF 14jg, which prior to the onset of its late 2013 eruption, was
a faint, unstudied, and virtually uncatalogued star. The salient features of the PTF 14jg outburst
are: (i) projected location near the W4 HII region and radial velocity consistent with physical
association; (ii) a lightcurve that underwent a $\sim$6-7 mag optical (R-band) through mid-infrared
(L-band) brightening on a few month time scale, that peaked and then faded by $\sim$3 mag, but plateaued
still $>$3.5 mag above quiescence by $\sim$8 months post-peak, lasting to at least five years after
eruption; (iii) strong outflow signatures, with velocities reaching -530 km/s; (iv) a low gravity
and broad ($\sim$100-150 km/s FWHM) optical absorption line spectrum that systematically changes
its spectral type with wavelength; (v) lithium; and (vi) ultraviolet and infrared excess. We tentatively
identify the outburst as exhibiting characteristics of a young star FU Ori event. However, the burst
would be unusually hot, with an absorption spectrum exhibiting high-excitation ($\sim$11,000-15,000
K) lines in the optical, and no evidence of CO in the near-infrared, in addition to exhibiting an unusual
lightcurve. We thus also consider alternative scenarios including various forms of novae, nuclear
burning instabilities, massive star events, and mergers -- finding them all inferior to the atypically
hot FU Ori star classification. The source eventually may be interpreted as a new category of young
star outburst with larger amplitude and shorter rise time than most FU Ori-like events. Continued
monitoring of the lightcurve and spectral evolution will reveal its true nature.
