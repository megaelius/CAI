We apply the vertical Jeans equation to the kinematics of Milky Way stars in the solar neighbourhood
to measure the local dark matter density. More than 90,000 G- and K-type dwarf stars are selected
from the cross-matched sample of LAMOST DR5 and Gaia DR2 for our analyses. The mass models applied
consist of a single exponential stellar disc, a razor thin gas disc and a constant dark matter density.
We first consider the simplified vertical Jeans equation which ignores the tilt term and assumes
a flat rotation curve. Under a Gaussian prior on the total stellar surface density, the local dark
matter density inferred from Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations is $0.0133_{-0.0022}^{+0.0024}\
{\rm M}_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-3}$. The local dark matter densities for subsamples in an azimuthal
angle range of $-10^{\circ} < \phi < 5^{\circ}$ are consistent within their 1$\sigma$ errors. However,
the northern and southern subsamples show a large discrepancy due to plateaux in the northern and
southern vertical velocity dispersion profiles. These plateaux may be the cause of the different
estimates of the dark matter density between the north and south. Taking the tilt term into account
has little effect on the parameter estimations and does not explain the north and south asymmetry.
Taking half of the difference of $\sigma_{z}$ profiles as unknown systematic errors, we then obtain
consistent measurements for the northern and southern subsamples. We discuss the influence of
the vertical data range, the scale height of the tracer population, the vertical distribution of
stars and the sample size on the uncertainty of the determination of the local dark matter density.
