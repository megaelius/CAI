In 2015 we started the XMM-Newton monitoring of the young solar-like star Epsilon Eridani (440 Myr),
one of the youngest solar-like stars with a known chromospheric CaII cycle. By analyzing the most
recent Mount Wilson S-index CaII data of this star, we found that the chromospheric cycle lasts 2.92
+/- 0.02 yr, in agreement with past results. From the long-term X-ray lightcurve, we find clear and
systematic X-ray variability of our target, consistent with the chromospheric CaII cycle. The
average X-ray luminosity results to be 2 x 10^28 erg/s, with an amplitude that is only a factor 2 throughout
the cycle. We apply a new method to describe the evolution of the coronal emission measure distribution
of Epsilon Eridani in terms of solar magnetic structures: active regions, cores of active regions
and flares covering the stellar surface at varying filling fractions. Combinations of these magnetic
structures can describe the observed X-ray emission measure of Epsilon Eridani only if the solar
flare emission measure distribution is restricted to events in the decay phase. The interpretation
is that flares in the corona of Epsilon Eridani last longer than their solar counterparts. We ascribe
this to the lower metallicity of Epsilon Eridani. Our analysis revealed also that the X-ray cycle
of Epsilon Eridani is strongly dominated by cores of active regions. The coverage fraction of cores
throughout the cycle changes by the same factor as the X-ray luminosity. The maxima of the cycle are
characterized by a high percentage of covering fraction of the flares, consistent with the fact
that flaring events are seen in the corresponding short-term X-ray lightcurves predominately
at the cycle maxima. The high X-ray emission throughout the cycle of Epsilon Eridani is thus explained
by the high percentage of magnetic structures on its surface.
