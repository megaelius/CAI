The interiors of quiescent prominences are filled with turbulent flows. The evolution of upflow
plumes, descending pillars, and vortex motions has been clearly detected in high-resolution observations.
The Rayleigh-Taylor instability is thought to be a driver of such internal flows. Descending pillars
are related to the mass budgets of prominences. There is a hypothesis of dynamic equilibrium where
the mass drainage via descending pillars and the mass supply via radiative condensation are balanced
to maintain the prominence mass; however, the background physics connecting the two different
processes is poorly understood. In this study, we reproduced the dynamic interior of a prominence
via radiative condensation and the mechanism similar to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability using
a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation including optically thin radiative cooling
and nonlinear anisotropic thermal conduction. The process to prominence formation in the simulation
follows the reconnection-condensation model, where topological change in the magnetic field
caused by reconnection leads to radiative condensation. Reconnection is driven by converging
motion at the footpoints of the coronal arcade fields. In contrast to the previous model, by randomly
changing the speed of the footpoint motion along a polarity inversion line, the dynamic interior
of prominence is successfully reproduced. We find that the mass condensation rate of the prominence
is enhanced in the case with dynamic state. Our results support the observational hypothesis that
the condensation rate is balanced with the mass drainage rate and suggest that a self-induced mass
maintenance mechanism exists.
