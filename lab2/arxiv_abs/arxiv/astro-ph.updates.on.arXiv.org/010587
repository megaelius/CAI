We give an overview of the SImulation of X-ray TElescopes (SIXTE) software package, a generic, mission-independent
Monte Carlo simulation toolkit for X-ray astronomical instrumentation. The package is based on
a modular approach for the source definition, the description of the optics, and the detector type
such that new missions can be easily implemented. The targets to be simulated are stored in a flexible
input format called SIMPUT. Based on this source definition, a sample of photons is produced and
then propagated through the optics. In order to model the detection process, the software toolkit
contains modules for various detector types, ranging from proportional counter and Si-based detectors,
to more complex descriptions like transition edge sensor (TES) devices. The implementation of
characteristic detector effects and a detailed modeling of the read-out process allow for representative
simulations and therefore enable the analysis of characteristic features, such as for example
pile-up, and their impact on observations. We present an overview of the implementation of SIXTE
from the input source, the imaging, and the detection process, highlighting the modular approach
taken by the SIXTE software package. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the simulation
software, we present a selection of representative applications, including the all-sky survey
of eROSITA and a study of pile-up effects comparing the currently operating XMM-Newton with the
planned Athena-WFI instrument. A simulation of a galaxy cluster with the Athena- X-IFU shows the
capability of SIXTE to predict the expected performance of an observation for a complex source with
a spatially varying spectrum and our current knowledge of the future instrument.
