The era of data-intensive astronomy is being ushered in with the increasing size and complexity
of observational data across wavelength and time domains, the development of algorithms to extract
information from this complexity, and the computational power to apply these algorithms to the
growing repositories of data. Data-intensive approaches are pushing the boundaries of nearly
all fields of astronomy, from exoplanet science to cosmology, and they are becoming a critical modality
for how we understand the universe. The success of these approaches range from the discovery of rare
or unexpected phenomena, to characterizing processes that are now accessible with precision astrophysics
and a deep statistical understanding of the datasets, to developing algorithms that maximize the
science that can be extracted from any set of observations. In this white paper, we propose a number
of initiatives to maximize Canada's ability to compete in this data-intensive era. We propose joining
international collaborations and leveraging Canadian facilities for legacy data potential.
We propose continuing to build a more agile computing infrastructure that's responsive to the needs
of tackling larger and more complex data, as well as enabling quick prototyping and scaling of algorithms.
We recognize that developing the fundamental skills of the field will be critical for Canadian astronomers,
and discuss avenues through with the appropriate computational and statistical training could
occur. Finally, we note that the transition to data-intensive techniques is not limited to astronomy,
and we should coordinate with other disciplines to develop and make use of best practises in methods,
infrastructure, and education.
