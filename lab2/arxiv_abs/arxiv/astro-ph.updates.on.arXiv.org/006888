We present unprecedented high-resolution TiO images and Fe I 1565 nm spectropolarimetric data
of two light bridges taken by the 1.6-m Goode Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory. In the
first light bridge (LB1), we find striking knot-like dark structures within the central dark lane.
Many dark knots show migration away from the penumbra along the light bridge. The sizes, intensity
depressions and apparent speeds of their proper motion along the light bridges of 33 dark knots identified
from the TiO images are mainly in the ranges of 80$\sim$200~km, 30\%$\sim$50\%, and 0.3$\sim$1.2~km~s$^{-1}$,
respectively. In the second light bridge (LB2), a faint central dark lane and striking transverse
intergranular lanes were observed. These intergranular lanes have sizes and intensity depressions
comparable to those of the dark knots in LB1, and also migrate away from the penumbra at similar speeds.
Our observations reveal that LB2 is made up of a chain of evolving convection cells, as indicated
by patches of blue shift surrounded by narrow lanes of red shift. The central dark lane generally
corresponds to blueshifts, supporting the previous suggestion of central dark lanes being the
top parts of convection upflows. In contrast, the intergranular lanes are associated with redshifts
and located at two sides of each convection cell. The magnetic fields are stronger in intergranular
lanes than in the central dark lane. These results suggest that these intergranular lanes are manifestations
of convergent convective downflows in the light bridge. We also provide evidence that the dark knots
observed in LB1 may have a similar origin.
