We present a search for nuclear X-ray emission in the Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) of a sample
of groups and clusters of galaxies extracted from the Chandra archive. The exquisite angular resolution
of Chandra allows us to obtain robust photometry at the position of the BCG, and to firmly identify
unresolved X-ray emission when present, thanks to an accurate characterization of the extended
emission at the BCG position. We consider two redshift bins (0.2<z<0.3 and 0.55<z<0.75) and analyze
all the clusters observed by Chandra with exposure time larger than 20 ks. Our samples have 81 BCGs
in 73 clusters and 51 BCGs in 49 clusters in the low- and high-redshift bin, respectively. X-ray emission
in the soft (0.5-2 keV) or hard (2-7 keV) band is detected only in 14 and 9 BCGs ($\sim 18$% of the total
samples), respectively. The X-ray photometry shows that at least half of the BCGs have a high hardness
ratio, compatible with significant intrinsic absorption. This is confirmed by the spectral analysis
with a power law model plus intrinsic absorption. We compute the fraction of X-ray bright BCGs above
a given hard X-ray luminosity, considering only sources with positive photometry in the hard band
(12/5 sources in the low/high-z sample). In the 0.2<z<0.3 interval the hard X-ray luminosity ranges
from $10^{42}$ to $7 \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with most sources found below $10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$.
In the $0.55<z<0.75$ range, we find a similar distribution of luminosities below $\sim 10^{44}$
erg s$^{-1}$, plus two very bright sources of a few $10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ associated to two radio
galaxies. We also find that X-ray luminous BCGs tend to be hosted by cool core clusters, despite the
majority of cool cores do not host nuclear X-ray emission.
