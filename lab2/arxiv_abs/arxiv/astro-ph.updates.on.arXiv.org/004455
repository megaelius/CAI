Hard x-ray spectral breaks are explained in terms of a 1D model with a co-spatial return current.
We study 19 flares observed by RHESSI (Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager) with strong
spectral breaks at energies around a few deka-keV, that cannot be explained by isotropic albedo
or non-uniform ionization alone. We identify these breaks at the HXR peak time, but we obtain 8 s-cadence
spectra of the entire impulsive phase. Electrons with an initially power-law distribution and
a sharp low-energy cutoff lose energy through return-current losses until they reach the thick
target, where they lose their remaining energy through collisions. Our main results are: (1) The
return-current collisional thick-target model (RCCTTM) provides acceptable fits for spectra
with strong breaks. (2) Limits on the plasma resistivity are derived from the fitted potential drop
and deduced electron-beam flux density, assuming the return-current is a drift current in the ambient
plasma. These resistivities are typically 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than the Spitzer resistivity
at the fitted temperature, and provide a test for the adequacy of classical resistivity and the stability
of the return current. (3) Using the upper limit of the low-energy cutoff, the return current is always
stable to the generation of ion acoustic and electrostatic ion cyclotron instabilities when the
electron temperature is lower than 9 times the ion temperature. (4) In most cases the return current
is most likely primarily carried by runaway electrons from the tail of the thermal distribution
rather than the bulk drifting thermal electrons. For these cases, anomalous resistivity is not
required.
