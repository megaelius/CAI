A core-collapse supernova releases the vast majority of the gravitational binding energy of its
compact remnant in the form of neutrinos over an interval of a few tens of seconds. In the event of a
core-collapse supernova within our galaxy, multiple current and future neutrino detectors would
see a large burst in activity. Neutrinos escape a supernova hours before light does, so any prompt
information about the supernova's direction that can be inferred via the neutrino signal will help
to enable early electromagnetic observations of the supernova. While there are methods to determine
the direction via intrinsic directionality of some neutrino-matter interaction channels, a complementary
method which will reach maturity with the next generation of large neutrino detectors is the use
of relative neutrino arrival times at different detectors around the globe. To evaluate this triangulation
method for realistic detector configurations of the next few decades, we generate random supernova
neutrino signals with realistic detector assumptions, and quantify the error in expected time
delay between detections. We investigate a practical and robust method of estimating the time differences
between burst detections, also correcting for detection efficiency bias. With this method, we
determine the pointing precision of supernova neutrino triangulation as a function of supernova
distance and location, detectors used, detector background level and neutrino mass ordering assumption.
Under favorable conditions, the 1$\sigma$ supernova search area from triangulation could be reduced
to a few percent of the sky. It should be possible to implement this method with low latency under realistic
conditions.
