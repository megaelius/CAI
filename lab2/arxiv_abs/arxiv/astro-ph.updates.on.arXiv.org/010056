We model the long-term XUV luminosity of TRAPPIST-1 to constrain the evolving high-energy radiation
environment experienced by its planetary system. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), we derive
probabilistic constraints for TRAPPIST-1's stellar and XUV evolution that account for observational
uncertainties, degeneracies between model parameters, and empirical data of low-mass stars.
We constrain TRAPPIST-1's mass to $m_{\star} = 0.089 \pm{0.001}$ M$_{\odot}$ and find that its
early XUV luminosity likely saturated at $\log_{10}(L_{XUV}/L_{bol}) = -3.05^{+0.24}_{-0.10}$.
From our posterior distributions, we infer that there is a ${\sim}43\%$ chance that TRAPPIST-1
is still in the saturated phase today, suggesting that TRAPPIST-1 has maintained high activity
and $L_{XUV}/L_{bol} \approx 10^{-3}$ for several Gyrs. TRAPPIST-1's planetary system therefore
likely experienced a persistent and extreme XUV flux environment, potentially driving significant
atmospheric erosion and volatile loss. The inner planets likely received XUV fluxes ${\sim}10^3
- 10^4\times$ that of the modern Earth during TRAPPIST-1's 1 Gyr-long pre-main sequence phase.
Deriving these constraints via MCMC is computationally non-trivial, so scaling our methods to
constrain the XUV evolution of a larger number of M dwarfs that harbor terrestrial exoplanets would
incur significant computational expenses. We demonstrate that approxposterior, a Python machine
learning package for approximate Bayesian inference using Gaussian processes, can efficiently
replicate our analysis. We find that it derives constraints that are in good agreement with our MCMC,
although it underestimates the uncertainties for two parameters by $30\%$. approxposterior requires
$330\times$ less computational time than traditional MCMC methods in this case, demonstrating
its utility in efficient Bayesian inference.
