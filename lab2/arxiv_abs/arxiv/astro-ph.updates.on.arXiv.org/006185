Utilizing James Clark Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) 850 $\mu$m SCUPOL dust polarization data, we investigate
the configuration of the magnetic ($B$) field in the circumnuclear disk (CND) of the Galactic Center
(GC). The SCUPOL data show a highly improved polarization coverage and resolution compared to earlier
100 $\mu$m observations. The 850 $\mu$m data have a resolution and coverage similar to previous
350 $\mu$m polarimetry data. However, with a proper sampling on a 10$"$ grid, we find the 850 $\mu$m
data trace the morphological structures of the CND substantially better. Furthermore, because
the 850 $\mu$m trace the field deeper into the material near Sgr A*, they represent the highest resolution
submillimeter probe to date of the CND magnetic field. The observed $B$-field morphology is well
described by a self-similar axisymmetric disk model where the radial infall velocity is one quarter
of the rotational velocity. A detailed comparison with higher-resolution interferometric maps
from the Submillimeter Array further reveals that the $B$-field aligns with the neutral gas streamers
connecting to the CND. Moreover, the innermost observed $B$-field structure also appears to trace
and align with the mini-spiral located inside the CND. This suggests that there is one underlying
$B$-field structure that is connecting the CND with its streamers and the inner mini-spiral. An
estimate of $\beta_{\rm Plasma} \lesssim 1-$based on the global B-field morphology that constrains
the azimuthal-to-vertical field strength ratio of around 40 combined with a measurement of the
azimuthal velocity--indicates that the B-field appears dynamically significant towards the
CND and also onwards to the inner mini-spiral.
