Our dataset contains spectroscopic observations of 29 globular clusters in the Magellanic Clouds
and the Milky Way performed with VLT/X-shooter. Here we present detailed data reduction procedures
for the VLT/X-shooter UVB and VIS arm. These are not restricted to our particular dataset, but are
generally applicable to different kinds of X-shooter data without major limitation on the astronomical
object of interest. The packaged pipeline provided by ESO (v1.5.0) performs well and reliably for
the wavelength calibration and the associated rectification procedure, yet we find several weaknesses
in the reduction cascade that are addressed with additional calibration steps, such as bad pixel
interpolation, flat fielding, and slit illumination corrections. Furthermore, the instrumental
PSF is analytically modeled and used to reconstruct flux losses at slit transit and for optimally
extracting point sources. Regular observations of spectrophotometric standard stars allow us
to detect instrumental variability, which needs to be understood if a reliable absolute flux calibration
is desired. A cascade of additional custom calibration steps is presented that allows for an absolute
flux calibration uncertainty of less than ten percent under virtually every observational setup
provided that the signal-to-noise ratio is sufficiently high. The optimal extraction increases
the signal-to-noise ratio typically by a factor of 1.5, while simultaneously correcting for resulting
flux losses. The wavelength calibration is found to be accurate to an uncertainty level of approximately
0.02 Angstrom. We find that most of the X-shooter systematics can be reliably modeled and corrected
for. This offers the possibility of comparing observations on different nights and with different
telescope pointings and instrumental setups, thereby facilitating a robust statistical analysis
of large datasets.
