We present optical observations of an exceptional Type II supernova, ASASSN-15nx. Its peak luminosity
at M_V = -20 mag is between those of typical core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and super-luminous
supernovae (SLSNe). The post-peak multi-band optical light curves show a remarkably long, linear
decline with a steep slope of 2.5 mag / 100 d (i.e., an exponential decline in flux), through to the
end of our observations at phase ~ 260d. In contrast, the light curves of the two major subclasses
of SNe II, Type II-P ("plateau") and Type II-L ("linear"), always show breaks in slopes at phase ~100
d, before settling onto Co56 radioactive decay tails with a decline rate typically of about 1 mag
/ 100 d. The spectra of ASASSN-15nx do not exhibit the narrow emission-line features characteristic
of Type IIn SNe, which can have a wide variety of light-curve shapes usually attributed to strong
interactions with circumstellar medium (CSM). ASASSN-15nx also exhibits a number of peculiar
spectroscopic properties, including a relatively weak H-alpha emission line that has an unusually
triangularly-shaped profile with no absorption component. The physical origin giving rise to
these peculiarities is unclear, while the long and linear post-peak light curve without a break
likely suggests a single dominant powering mechanism. The light curve is consistent with being
predominantly powered by the decay of a large amount of Ni56 (M_Ni = 1.6 +/- 0.2 M_sun), and substantial
gamma-ray escape from the ejecta is needed to explain the steep light-curve slope, which is possibly
due to a low-mass hydrogen envelope of the progenitor. Another possibility is strong CSM interactions
mostly powering the light curve, and the CSM needs to be sculpted to produce the unique light-curve
shape as well as avoid producing SN IIn-like narrow emission lines.
