We have developed an online radiative-transfer suite (https://psg.gsfc.nasa.gov) applicable
to a broad range of planetary objects (e.g., planets, moons, comets, asteroids, TNOs, KBOs, exoplanets).
The Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) can synthesize planetary spectra (atmospheres and surfaces)
for a broad range of wavelengths (UV/Vis/near-IR/IR/far-IR/THz/sub-mm/Radio) from any observatory
(e.g., JWST, ALMA, Keck, SOFIA), any orbiter (e.g., ExoMars, Juno), or any lander (e.g., MSL). This
is achieved by combining several state-of-the-art radiative transfer models, spectroscopic
databases and planetary databases (i.e., climatological and orbital). PSG has a 3D (three-dimensional)
orbital calculator for most bodies in the solar system, and all confirmed exoplanets, while the
radiative-transfer models can ingest billions of spectral signatures for hundreds of species
from several spectroscopic repositories. It integrates the latest radiative-transfer and scattering
methods in order to compute high resolution spectra via line-by-line calculations, and utilizes
the efficient correlated-k method at moderate resolutions, while for computing cometary spectra,
PSG handles non-LTE and LTE excitation processes. PSG includes a realistic noise calculator that
integrates several telescope / instrument configurations (e.g., interferometry, coronagraphs)
and detector technologies (e.g., CCD, heterodyne detectors, bolometers). Such an integration
of advanced spectroscopic methods into an online tool can greatly serve the planetary community,
ultimately enabling the retrieval of planetary parameters from remote sensing data, efficient
mission planning strategies, interpretation of current and future planetary data, calibration
of spectroscopic data, and development of new instrument/spacecraft concepts.
