The Gaia DR2 short timescale variable candidates sample results from the investigation of the first
22 months of Gaia $G$ per-CCD, $G_{BP}$ and $G_{RP}$ photometry, for a subsample of sources at the
Gaia faint end ($G \sim 16.5 - 20\,$mag). For this first Gaia short timescale variability search,
we limit ourselves to the case of rapid, suspected periodic variability. Our study combines fast
variability detection through variogram analysis, Least-Square high frequency search, and empirical
selection criterion based on various statistics and built from the investigation of specific sources
seen through Gaia eyes (e.g. known variables or visually identified objects with peculiar features
in their light-curves). The progressive selection criterion definition, improvement and validation
also make use of supplementary ground-based photometric monitoring, performed at the Flemish
Mercator telescope in La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain) between August and November 2017. We publish
a list of 3018 bona fide, suspected periodic, short timescale variable candidates, spread all over
the sky, with a contamination level from false positives and non-periodic variables up to 10-20\%
in the Magellanic Clouds. Though its completeness is around 0.05\%, the Gaia DR2 short timescale
variables sample recover very interesting known short period variables, such as Post Common Envelope
Binaries or Cataclysmic Variables, and points fascinating newly discovered variables sources.
Several improvements in the short timescale variability processing are considered for the future
Gaia Data Releases, by enhancing the existing variogram and period search algorithms or going one
step beyond with the classification of the identified candidates. The encouraging outcome of our
analysis demonstrates the power of the Gaia mission for such fast variability studies and opens
great perspectives for this domain of astrophysics.
