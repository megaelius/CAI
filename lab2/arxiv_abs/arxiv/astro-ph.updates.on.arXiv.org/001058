This paper presents a detailed analysis of supernova remnant (SNR) N103B located in the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC), based on Suzaku and Chandra observations. The spectrum of the entire SNR was reproduced
using 3 ISM components with the kT of 0.32, 0.56, and 0.92keV and one ejecta component of 3.96keV,
based on spectral analysis of the Suzaku/XIS data. The ejecta was overabundant in heavy elements,
such as Mg, Si, S, Ca, Fe, and Ni. The unprecedentedly high quality of data obtained by XIS, allowed
us to correctly distinguish between the emissions from the ISM and the ejecta for the first time.
Combining XIS spectral analysis with Chandra/ACIS image analysis, we verified that the ejecta
distributions for elements from Si to Fe-K were similar to one another, although Fe-K emission was
located slightly inward compared with that of lighter elements such as Si, S, Ar, and Ca. The onion-like
structure of the ejecta was maintained after the SN. In addition, the ISM emission represented by
O and Fe-L was located inside the ejecta emission. We compared hydrogen-rich ejecta plasma, which
is indicative of Type II SNRs, with plasma rich in heavy elements and poor in hydrogen, which is mainly
observed in Type Ia. In the case of N103B, we could not determine whether the origin of the continuum
emission in the 4.0-6.0keV band was from ejecta or high-temperature ISM only based on the spectral
modeling of XIS data. High-energy continuum images in the 5.2-6.0keV band obtained by ACIS were
extremely similar to those of ejecta, implying that the origin of the high-energy continuum might
indeed be the ejecta. By combining spectral analysis with high-energy continuum images, we found
some indications for H-dominated plasma, and as a result, that the progenitor of N103B might have
been a Type II. The progenitor mass was estimated to be 13 Msun based on the abundance patterns of Mg,
Fe, and Ni relative to Si.
