Quasars are high-luminosity active galactic nuclei believed to be powered by accretion of interstellar
matter onto a super-massive black hole (SMBH) therein. Most of the observed energy is released in
an accretion disk of inspiralling gas surrounding the SMBH. An enormous amount of fueling material
is expected to be transported inwards. However, basic questions remain unanswered as to whether
and how the accretion disks are supplied with external gas, since no disk-feeding inflow has hitherto
been observed clearly. Here we report the discovery of highly redshifted broad absorption lines
arising from neutral hydrogen and helium atoms in a small sample of quasars. Their absorption troughs
show a broad range of Doppler velocities from zero extending continuously inward up to as high as
$\sim 5,000$ km s$^{-1}$. We thus see through streams of cold gas moving with a radially inward velocity
component that spans an immense gradient---a result of gravitational acceleration by the central
SMBH. Extensive photo-ionization modeling for the archetypical object SDSS J103516.20+142200.6
indicates the inflowing gas to be dense, thick and moderately ionized, with a characteristic distance
to the SMBH of $\sim 1,000$ gravitational radii, possibly overlapping or close to the outer accretion
disk. Our results present the first compelling evidence for the long-sought inflow directly feeding
quasars' accretion disks with external materials, likely originating from the dusty torus at a
parsec scale. Our approach provides a new tool to probe the bulk of the so far elusive fueling inflows
in quasars. Their studies may help address some of the fundamental questions concerning accretion
physics, the onset and sustainment of quasar activity, and the SMBH growth at centers of most galaxies.
