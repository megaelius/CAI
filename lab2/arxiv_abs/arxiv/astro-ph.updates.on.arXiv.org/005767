M49 (NGC 4472) is the dominant galaxy in subcluster B of the Virgo Cluster, and a benchmark for studying
the build-up of the extended halos of brightest group galaxies in the outskirts of galaxy clusters.
We investigate the kinematics in the outer halo of M49, look for substructures, and describe the
transition to the surrounding intra-group light. As kinematic tracers we use planetary nebulae
(PNe), combining kinematics from the extended Planetary Nebula Spectrograph (PN.S) early-type
galaxy survey with our recent deep photometric sample. We study the position-velocity-plane for
bright and faint PN populations out to 95 kpc radius, and employ a multi-Gaussian model for the velocity
distribution to identify stellar populations with distinct kinematics and histories. We report
the detection of stellar-kinematic substructure associated with the interaction of M49 with the
dwarf irregular galaxy VCC 1249. We find two kinematically distinct PN populations associated
with the main M49 halo and the extended intra-group light (IGL). These have velocity dispersions
$\sigma_{halo}\simeq 170$ km/s and $\sigma_{IGL} \simeq400$ km/s at 10-80 kpc radii. The overall
luminosity profile and velocity dispersion at $\sim80$ kpc are consistent with a flat circular
velocity curve extrapolated from X-ray observations. The dispersion of the PNe associated with
the IGL joins onto that of the satellite galaxies in subcluster B at $\sim100$ kpc radius. This is
the first time that the transition from halo to IGL is observed based on the velocities of individual
stars. Therefore the halo of M49, consisting of at least three distinct components, has undergone
an extended accretion history within its parent group potential. The blue colours of the IGL component
are consistent with a population of stars formed in low-mass galaxies at redshift $\sim0.5$ that
has since evolved passively, as suggested by other data.
