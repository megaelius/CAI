The discovery of a binary neutron star merger (NSM) through both its gravitational wave and electromagnetic
emission has revealed these events to be key sites of r-process nucleosynthesis. Here, we evaluate
the prospects of finding the remnants of Galactic NSMs by detecting the gamma-ray decay lines from
their radioactive r-process ejecta. We find that $^{126}$Sn, which has several lines in the energy
range 415-695 keV and resides close to the second r-process peak, is the most promising isotope,
because of its half-life $t_{1/2}=2.30(14)\times 10^{5}$ yr being comparable to the ages of recent
NSMs. Using a Monte Carlo procedure, we predict that multiple remnants are detectable as individual
sources by next-generation gamma-ray telescopes which achieve sub-MeV line sensitivities of
$\sim 10^{-8}$-$10^{-6}$ $\gamma$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. However, given the unknown locations
of the remnants, the most promising search strategy is a systematic survey of the Galactic plane
and bulge extending to high Galactic latitudes. Individual known supernova remnants which may
be mis-classified NSM remnants could also be targeted, especially those located outside the Galactic
plane. Detection of a moderate sample of Galactic NSM remnants would provide important clues to
unresolved issues such as the production of actinides in NSMs, properties of merging NS binaries,
and even help distinguish them from rare supernovae as current Galactic r-process sources. We also
investigate the diffuse flux from longer-lived nuclei (e.g. $^{182}$Hf) that could in principle
trace the Galactic spatial distribution of NSMs over longer timescales, but find that the detection
of the diffuse flux appears challenging even with next-generation telescopes.
