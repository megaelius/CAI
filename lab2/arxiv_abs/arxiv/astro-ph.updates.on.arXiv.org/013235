The evolution of differential ages of passive galaxies at different redshifts (cosmic chronometers)
has been proved to be a method potentially able to constrain the Hubble parameter in a cosmology-independent
way, but the systematic uncertainties must be carefully evaluated. In this paper, we compute the
contribution to the full covariance matrix of systematic uncertainties due to the choice of initial
mass function, stellar library, and metallicity, exploring a variety of stellar population synthesis
models; the effect of a residual young component and star formation history was discussed elsewhere.
Through simulations in the redshift range 0<z<1.5 we find that the choice of the stellar population
synthesis model dominates the total error budget on H(z), with contributions at ~4.5% level, discarding
the most discordant model. The contribution due to the choice of initial mass function is <0.5%,
while that due to the stellar library is ~6.6% on average. In parallel, we also assess the impact of
an uncertainty in the determination of the stellar metallicity, finding that an error of ~10% (5%)
on the stellar metallicity propagates to a 9% (4%) error on H(z). These results are used to provide
the combined contribution of these systematic effects on the error budget. For current H(z) measurements,
where the uncertainties due to metallicity and star formation history were already included, we
show that, using the more modern stellar libraries, the additional systematic uncertainty is between
5.4% (at z=0.2) and 2.3% (at z=1.5). To reach the goal of keeping the systematic error budget below
the 1% level we discuss that efforts needed to obtain higher resolution and signal-to-noise spectra
and improvements in the modeling of stellar population synthesis.
