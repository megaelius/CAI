Transport of angular momentum has been a challenging topic within the stellar evolution community,
even more since the recent asteroseismic surveys. All published studies on rotation using asteroseismic
observations show a discrepancy between the observed and calculated rotation rates, indicating
there is an undetermined process of angular momentum transport active in these stars. We aim to constrain
the efficiency of this process by investigating rotation rates of 2.5 M$_{\odot}$ stars. First,
we investigated whether the Tayler-Spruit dynamo could be responsible for the extra transport
of angular momentum for stars with an initial mass of 2.5 M$_{\odot}$. Then, by computing rotating
models including a constant additional artificial viscosity, we determined the efficiency of
the missing process of angular momentum transport by comparing the models to the asteroseismic
observations of core helium burning stars. Parameter studies were performed to investigate the
effect of the stellar evolution code used, initial mass, and evolutionary stage. We evolved our
models into the white dwarf phase, and provide a comparison to white dwarf rotation rates. The Tayler-Spruit
dynamo is unable to provide enough transport of angular momentum to reach the observed values of
the core helium burning stars investigated in this paper. We find that a value for the additional
artificial viscosity $\nu_{\rm{add}}$ around 10$^7$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ provides enough transport
of angular momentum. However, the rotational period of these models is too high in the white dwarf
phase to match the white dwarf observations. From this comparison we infer that the efficiency of
the missing process must decrease during the core helium burning phase. When excluding the $\nu_{\rm{add}}$
during core helium burning phase, we can match the rotational periods of both the core helium burning
stars and white dwarfs.
