Semi-analytical models of disk outflows have successfully described magnetically-driven, self-confined
super-Alfv\'enic jets from near Keplerian accretion disks. These Jet Emitting Disks are possible
for high levels of disk magnetization $\mu$ defined as $\mu=2/\beta$ where beta is the usual plasma
parameter. In near-equipartition JEDs, accretion is supersonic and jets carry away most of the
disk angular momentum. However, these solutions prove difficult to compare with cutting edge numerical
simulations, for the reason that numerical simulations show wind-like outflows but in the domain
of small magnetization. In this work, we present for the first time self-similar isothermal solutions
for accretion-ejection structures at small magnetization levels. We elucidate the role of MRI-like
structures in the acceleration processes that drive this new class of solutions. The disk magnetization
$\mu$ is the main control parameter: massive outflows driven by the pressure of the toroidal magnetic
field are obtained up to $\mu \sim 10^{-2}$, while more tenuous centrifugally-driven outflows
are obtained at larger $\mu$ values. The generalized parameter space and the astrophysical consequences
are discussed. We believe that these new solutions could be a stepping stone in understanding the
way astrophysical disks drive either winds or jets. Defining jets as self-confined outflows and
winds as uncollimated outflows, we propose a simple analytical criterion based on the initial energy
content of the outflow, to discriminate jets from winds. We show that jet solution are achieved at
all magnetization level, while winds could be obtained only in weakly magnetized disks that feature
heating.
