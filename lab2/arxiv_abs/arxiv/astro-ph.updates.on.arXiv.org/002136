We propose an explanation of features of spiral galaxies: spiral arms and observed flat rotation
curves, without the presence of an exotic form of matter. The formalism is based on Boltzmanns transport
equation for the collisional matter and the very-low-velocity post-Newtonian approximation
of the general relativity equations expressed in the Maxwell-like form. The Maxwell-like formulation
provides the base for the explanation of the above phenomena in the language of dynamically created
gravitoelectromagnetic fields by the movement of mass streams in the plane of the galaxy disc. In
the model we use radical simplifications expressed as neglect of the gravitational interaction
between neighbors and approximation of the incompressible mass flow. In this frame we show that
if the galaxy is fuelled constantly by mass from an external gas reservoir, then the amplification
of the gravitomagnetic field can be large enough to create the rotational velocity pattern and spiral
arms without the necessity of introducing exotic matter or any other new phenomena. In this framework
the collisional part of the mass gas in the galaxy disc plane, i.e. molecules and atoms, is responsible
for the creation of the gravitomagnetic field. According to the model the spiral pattern of arms
is static and determines the mass flow, identified by the galaxy spiral structure, which moves towards
the galaxy center from the peripheries of the galaxy disc. The model reproduces qualitatively the
observed spiral arms and reproduces well the shape of the rotational velocity pattern. Prediction
for the radial velocity is below 10 $km\mbox{ }s^{-1}$, in agreement with observations. As an example
of the usability of the proposed mechanism, we reproduce qualitatively the above features for the
IC 342 and NGC 4321 galaxies.
