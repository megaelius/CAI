Galactic winds regulate star formation in disk galaxies and help to enrich the circum-galactic
medium. They are therefore crucial for galaxy formation, but their driving mechanism is still poorly
understood. Recent studies have demonstrated that cosmic rays (CRs) can drive outflows if active
CR transport is taken into account. Using hydrodynamical simulations of isolated galaxies with
virial masses between $10^{10}$ and $10^{13}\mathrm{~M_\odot}$, we study how the properties
of CR-driven winds depend on halo mass. CRs are treated in a two-fluid approximation and their transport
is modelled through isotropic or anisotropic diffusion. We find that CRs are only able to drive mass-loaded
winds beyond the virial radius in haloes with masses below $10^{12}\mathrm{~M_\odot}$. For our
lowest examined halo mass, the wind is roughly spherical and has velocities of $\sim20\mathrm{~km\;s^{-1}}$.
With increasing halo mass, the wind becomes biconical and can reach ten times higher velocities.
The mass loading factor drops rapidly with virial mass, a dependence that approximately follows
a power-law with a slope between $-1$ and $-2$. This scaling is slightly steeper than observational
inferences, and also steeper than commonly used prescriptions for wind feedback in cosmological
simulations. The slope is quite robust to variations of the CR injection efficiency or the CR diffusion
coefficient. In contrast to the mass loading, the energy loading shows no significant dependence
on halo mass. While these scalings are close to successful heuristic models of wind feedback, the
CR-driven winds in our present models are not yet powerful enough to fully account for the required
feedback strength.
