A key challenge in origin-of-life studies is understanding the environmental conditions on early
Earth under which abiogenesis occurred. While some constraints do exist (e.g., zircon evidence
for surface liquid water), relatively few constraints exist on the abundances of trace chemical
species, which are relevant to assessing the plausibility and guiding the development of postulated
prebiotic chemical pathways which depend on these species. In this work, we combine literature
photochemistry models with simple equilibrium chemistry calculations to place constraints on
the plausible range of concentrations of sulfidic anions (HS$^-$, HSO$_3^{-}$, SO$_3^{2-}$)
available in surficial aquatic reservoirs on early Earth due to outgassing of SO$_2$ and H$_2$S
and their dissolution into small shallow surface water reservoirs like lakes. We find that this
mechanism could have supplied prebiotically relevant levels of SO$_2$-derived anions, but not
H$_2$S-derived anions. Radiative transfer modelling suggests UV light would have remained abundant
on the planet surface for all but the largest volcanic explosions. We apply our results to the case
study of the proposed prebiotic reaction network of Patel et al. (2015), and discuss the implications
for improving its prebiotic plausibility. In general, epochs of moderately high volcanism could
have been especially conducive to cyanosulfidic prebiotic chemistry. Our work can be similarly
applied to assess and improve the prebiotic plausibility of other postulated surficial prebiotic
chemistries that are sensitive to sulfidic anions, and our methods adapted to study other atmospherically-derived
trace species.
