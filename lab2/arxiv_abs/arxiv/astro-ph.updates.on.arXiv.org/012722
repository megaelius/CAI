The deuterium fractionation in starless cores gives us a clue to estimate their lifetime scales,
thus allowing us to distinguish between different dynamical theories of core formation. Cores
also seem to be subject to a differential N2 and CO depletion which was not expected from models. We
aim to make a survey of 10 cores to estimate their lifetime scales and depletion profiles in detail.
After L183, in Serpens, we present the second cloud of the series, L1512 in Auriga. To constrain the
lifetime scale, we perform chemical modeling of the deuteration profiles across L1512 based on
dust extinction measurements from near-infrared observations and non-local thermal equilibrium
radiative transfer with multiple line observations of N2H+, N2D+, DCO+, C18O, and 13CO, plus H2D+
(1$_{10}$--1$_{11}$). We find a peak density of 1.1$\times$10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$ and a central temperature
of 7.5$\pm$1 K, which are respectively higher and lower compared with previous dust emission studies.
The depletion factors of N2H+ and N2D+ are 27$^{+17}_{-13}$ and 4$^{+2}_{-1}$ in L1512, intermediate
between the two other more advanced and denser starless core cases, L183 and L1544. These factors
also indicate a similar freeze-out of N2 in L1512, compared to the two others despite a peak density
one to two orders of magnitude lower. Retrieving CO and N2 abundance profiles with the chemical model,
we find that CO has a depletion factor of $\sim$430-870 and the N2 profile is similar to that of CO unlike
towards L183. Therefore, L1512 has probably been living long enough so that N2 chemistry has reached
steady state. N2H+ modeling remains compulsory to assess the precise physical conditions in the
center of cold starless cores, rather than dust emission. L1512 is presumably older than 1.4 Myr.
Therefore, the dominating core formation mechanism should be ambipolar diffusion for this source.
