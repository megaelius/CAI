If dark matter is composed of weakly interacting particles, Earth's orbital motion may induce a
small annual variation in the rate at which these particles interact in a terrestrial detector.
The DAMA collaboration has identified at a 9.3$\sigma$ confidence level such an annual modulation
in their event rate over two detector iterations, DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA, each with $\sim7$ years
of observations. We statistically examine the time dependence of the modulation amplitudes, which
"by eye" appear to be decreasing with time in certain energy ranges. We perform a chi-squared goodness
of fit test of the average modulation amplitudes measured\ by the two detector iterations which
rejects the hypothesis of a consistent modulation amplitude at greater than 80\%, 96\%, and 99.6\%
for the 2--4~keVee, 2--5~keVee and 2--6~keVee energy ranges, respectively. We also find that among
the 14 annual cycles there are three $\gtrsim 3\sigma$ departures from the average in the 5-6~keVee
energy range. In addition, we examined several phenomenological models for the time dependence
of the modulation amplitude. Using a maximum likelihood test, we find that descriptions of the modulation
amplitude as decreasing with time are preferred over a constant modulation amplitude at anywhere
between 1$\sigma$ and 3$\sigma$, depending on the phenomenological model for the time dependence
and the signal energy range considered. A time dependent modulation amplitude is not expected for
a dark matter signal, at least for dark matter halo morphologies consistent with the DAMA signal.
New data from DAMA/LIBRA--phase2 will certainly aid in determining whether any apparent time dependence
is a real effect or a statistical fluctuation.
