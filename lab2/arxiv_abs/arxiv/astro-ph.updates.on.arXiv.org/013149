The combination of optical and mid-infrared (mid-IR) photometry has been extensively used to select
red Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Our aim is to explore the obscuration properties of these red AGN
with both X-ray spectroscopy as well as Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs). In this study, we
re-visit the relation between optical/mid-IR extinction and X-ray absorption. We use IR selection
criteria, specifically the $W1$ and $W2$ WISE bands (Assef et al.), to identify 4798 AGN in the $\it{XMM-XXL}$
area ($\sim 25$\,deg$^2$). Application of optical/mid-IR colours ($r- W2 > 6$) reveals 561 red
AGN (14$\%$). 47/561 have available X-ray spectra with at least 50 net (background-subtracted)
counts per detector. For these sources, we construct SEDs from the optical to the mid-IR using the
CIGALE code. The SED fitting shows that 44/47 sources present clear signs of obscuration, based
on the AGN emission and the estimated inclination angle. SED fitting also reveals ten systems ($\sim20\%$)
which are dominated by the galaxy. In these cases, the red colours are attributed to the host galaxy
rather than AGN absorption. Excluding these ten systems from our sample and applying X-ray spectral
fitting analysis, shows that up to $76\%$ (28/37) of the IR red AGN present signs of X-ray absorption.
Thus, there are nine sources ($\sim20\%$ of the sample) that although optically red, are not substantially
X-ray absorbed. $\sim 50\%$ of these sources present broad emission lines in their optical spectra.
We suggest that the reason for this apparent discrepancy is that the r-W2 criterion is sensitive
to smaller amounts of obscuration relative to the X-ray spectroscopy. In conclusion, it appears
that the majority of red AGN present considerable obscuration levels as shown by their SEDs. Their
X-ray absorption is moderate with a mean of $\rm N_H \sim 10^{22}\, \rm{cm^{-2}}$.
