Quasar proximity zones at $z>5.5$ correspond to over-dense and over-ionized environments. Galaxies
found inside proximity zones can therefore display features which would otherwise be masked by
absorption in the IGM. We demonstrate the utility of this quasar-galaxy synergy by reporting the
discovery of the first three `proximate Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters' (LAEs) within the proximity
zone of quasar J0836 at $z=5.802$ (\textit{Aerith A, B} and \textit{C}). \textit{Aerith A}, located
behind the quasar with an impact parameter $D_\perp = 278$ pkpc, provides the first detection of
a Lyman-$\alpha$ transverse proximity effect. We model the transmission and show it constrains
the onset of J0836's quasar phase to $0.2 \text{Myr}<t<20\text{Myr}$ in the past. The second object,
\textit{Aerith B} at a distance $D=750$ pkpc from the quasar, displays a bright, broad double-peaked
\lal emission line. Based on relations calibrated at $z\leq3$, the peak separation implies a low
ionizing $f_{\text{esc}} \lesssim 1\%$, the most direct such constraint on a reionization-era
galaxy. We fit the Ly-$\alpha$ line with an outflowing shell model, finding a completely typical
central density $\text{log N}_{\text{HI}}/\text{cm}^{-2} = 19.3_{-0.2}^{+0.8}$, outflow
velocity $v=16_{-11}^{+4}$ km s$^{-1}$, and gas temperature $\text{log} T/\text{K} = 3.8_{-0.7}^{+0.8}$
compared to $2<z<3$ analogue LAEs. Finally, we detect an emission line at $\lambda=8177$ \AA\ in
object \textit{Aerith C} which, if it is \lal at $z=5.726$, would correspond closely with the end
of the quasar's proximity zone ($\Delta z<0.02$ from the boundary) and suggests the quasar influences
the IGM up to $\sim85$ cMpc away, making it the largest quasar proximity zone. Via the analyses conducted
here, we illustrate how proximate LAEs offer unique insight into the ionizing properties of both
quasars and galaxies during the epoch of reionization.
