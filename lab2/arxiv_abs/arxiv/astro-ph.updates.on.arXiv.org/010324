We present a synthetic galaxy lightcone specially designed for narrow-band optical photometric
surveys. To reduce time-discreteness effects, unlike previous works, we directly include the
lightcone construction in the \texttt{L-Galaxies} semi-analytic model applied to the subhalo
merger trees of the {\tt Millennium} simulation. Additionally, we add a model for the nebular emission
in star-forming regions, which is crucial for correctly predicting the narrow/medium-band photometry
of galaxies. Explicitly, we consider, individually for each galaxy, the contribution of 9 different
lines: $\rm Ly{\alpha}$ (1216\AA), \Hb (4861\AA), \Ha (6563\AA), {\oii} (3727\AA, 3729\AA),
{\oiii} (4959\AA, 5007\AA), $\rm [\ion{Ne}{III}]$ (3870\AA), {\oi} (6300\AA), $\rm [\ion{N}{II}]$
(6548\AA, 6583\AA), and $\rm [\ion{S}{II}]$ (6717\AA, 6731\AA). We validate our lightcone by
comparing galaxy number counts, angular clustering, and \Ha, \Hb, {\oii} and {\oiiiFd} luminosity
functions to a compilation of observations. As an application of our mock lightcones, we generate
catalogues tailored for J-PLUS, a large optical galaxy survey featuring 5 broad and 7 medium band
filters. We study the ability of the survey to correctly identify, with a simple \textit{three filter
method}, a population of emission-line galaxies at various redshifts. We show that the $4000\AA$
break in the spectral energy distribution of galaxies can be misidentified as line emission. However,
all significant excess (larger than 0.4 magnitudes) can be correctly and unambiguously attributed
to emission line galaxies. Our catalogues are publicly released to facilitate their use in interpreting
narrow-band surveys and for quantifying the impact of line emission in broad band photometry.
