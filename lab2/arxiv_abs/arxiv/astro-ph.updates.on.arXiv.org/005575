We calculate accretion mass of interstellar objects (ISOs) like `Oumuamua onto low-mass population
III stars (Pop.~III survivors), and surface pollution of Pop.~III survivors. An ISO number density
estimated from the discovery of `Oumuamua is so high ($\sim 0.2$~au$^{-3}$) that Pop.~III survivors
have chances at colliding with ISOs $\gtrsim 10^5$ times per $1$~Gyr. In contrast, Pop.~III survivors
never collide with free floating planets and Pop.~I/II stars in the Hubble time. `Oumuamua itself
would be sublimated if it approaches to Pop.~III survivors, since it has small size, $\sim 100$~m.
However, ISOs with size $\gtrsim 3$~km would reach the surfaces of Pop.~III survivors. Supposing
an ISO cumulative number density with size larger than $D$ is $n \propto D^{-\alpha}$, Pop.~III
survivors can accrete ISO mass $\gtrsim 10^{-16}M_\odot$, or ISO iron mass $\gtrsim 10^{-17}M_\odot$,
if $\alpha < 4$. This iron mass is larger than the accretion mass of interstellar medium (ISM) by several
orders of magnitude, since stellar wind of Pop.~III survivors prevents ISM from falling into Pop.~III
survivors. Considering material mixing in a convection zone of Pop.~III survivors, we obtain their
surface pollution is typically [Fe/H] $\lesssim -8$ in most cases, however the surface pollution
of Pop.~III survivors with $0.8M_\odot$ can be [Fe/H] $\gtrsim -6$ because of the very shallow convective
layer. The dependence of the metal pollution is as follows. If $\alpha > 4$, Pop.~III survivors have
no chance at colliding with ISOs with $D \gtrsim 3$~km, and keep metal-free. If $3 < \alpha < 4$, Pop.~III
survivors would be most polluted by ISOs up to [Fe/H] $\sim -7$. If $\alpha < 3$ up to $D \sim 10$~km,
Pop.~III survivors could hide in metal-poor stars so far discovered. Although the metal pollution
depends on $\alpha$, we first show the importance of ISOs for the metal pollution of Pop.~III survivors.
