In the era of "big data" and with the advent of web 2.0 technologies, ESASky (this http URL) aims at
providing a modern and visual way to access astronomical science-ready data products and metadata.
The main goal of the application is to simplify the interaction between the scientific community
and the ever-growing amount of data collected over the past decades from the most important astronomy
missions. The ESASky concept is to offer a complementary scientific application to the more-traditional
table-oriented exploitation of astronomical data, by allowing a more natural and visual approach
and enabling the exploration of astronomical objects across the entire electromagnetic spectrum.
To fulfill this goal, ESASky provides a multiwavelength interface to a set of astronomy data from
an increasing number of missions and surveys, with the intention of becoming the single-point of
entry to perform visual analysis and cross-matching among different energy ranges. A lot of effort
has been invested on the design of a user-friendly, responsive Graphical User Interface (GUI) by
the definition and optimisation of algorithms running behind each visual feature offered. In this
contribution, we describe in detail the design and solutions adopted for the technical challenges
arising during the development. We present the data services and features implemented in the latest
version of ESASky (v2.1), including a Mission Planning Tool to support current James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) planning, the possibility to search for observations of Solar System Objects
(planets, comets and moons) taken by astronomy missions, the integration of the SAO/NASA Astrophysics
Data System (ADS) publication system in the ESASky GUI, and the retrieval of metadata and data products
available within a specific region of the sky.
