We identified a peculiar proximate sub-damped Lya absorption system (sub-DLA) at z=3.234 with
a neutral hydrogen column density of $N_{H} =10^{19.70\pm0.15}~\rm cm^{-2}$ toward the quasar
SDSS J125903.26+621211.5 in two epoch optical spectra of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We detected
Lya residue in the proximate sub-DLA trough at $> 8\sigma$ level. To our surprise, extreme ultraviolet
(EUV) continuum emission is significantly ($> 4\sigma$) detected in the corresponding Lymann
limit absorption edge at both of the FUV and NUV bands by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer. The high neutral
hydrogen column density should allow a negligible transmission of both the Lya line photons and
EUV continuum photons due to the high optical depth of the gas. The possible scenarios of foreground
galaxy contamination, partial coverage, emission from the quasar host galaxy, and extended Lya
emission are excluded in turn, and we speculate that the residual Lya and EUV emission is due to photons
scattering (broad Lya and the continuum emission) of electrons residing at a spatial scale larger
than that of the proximate sub-DLA. Electron scattering is wavelength-independent, the scattered
light is therefore a copy of the incident spectrum that might originate in the accretion disk. With
the assistances from the neutral hydrogen absorbers as the "natural coronagraph" and the scatterers
as the "natural mirror", we yielded a very hard EUV spectral index of $\alpha = 0.65\pm 0.25$ ($F_{\nu}\propto
\nu^{\alpha}$), consistent with the standard picture of the locally heated accretion disk in the
inner EUV-emitting radii, as well as in the outer near-infrared-emitting radii suggested by Kishimoto
et al. (2008).
