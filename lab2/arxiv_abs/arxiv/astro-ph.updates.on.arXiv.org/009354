During eruptive flares, vector magnetograms show increasing horizontal magnetic field and downward
Lorentz force in the Sun's photosphere around the polarity-inversion line. Such behavior has often
been associated with the implosion conjecture and interpreted as the result of either momentum
conservation while the eruption moves upward, or of the contraction of flare loops. We characterize
the physical origin of these observed behaviors by analyzing a generic 3D MHD simulation of an eruptive
flare. Even though the simulation was undesigned to recover the magnetic field and Lorentz force
properties, it is fully consistent with them, and it provides key additional informations to understand
them. The area where the magnetic field increases gradually develops between current ribbons,
which spread away from each other and are connected to the coronal region. This area is merely the
footprint of the coronal post-flare loops, whose contraction increases their shear field component
and the magnetic energy density in line with the ideal induction equation. For simulated data, we
computed the Lorentz force density map by applying the method used in observations. We obtained
increase of the downward component of the Lorentz force density around the PIL -consistent with
observations. However, this significantly differs from the Lorentz force density maps obtained
directly from the 3D magnetic field and current. These results altogether question previous interpretations
based on the implosion conjecture and momentum conservation with the CME, and rather imply that
the observed increases in photospheric horizontal magnetic fields result from the reconnection-driven
contraction of sheared flare-loops.
