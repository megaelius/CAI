IGR J17591-2342 is a recently INTEGRAL discovered accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar that went
into outburst around July 21, 2018. To better understand the physics acting in these systems during
the outburst episode we performed detailed temporal-, timing- and spectral analyses across the
0.3-300 keV band using data from NICER, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and INTEGRAL. The hard X-ray 20-60 keV
outburst profile is composed of four flares. During the maximum of the last flare we discovered a
type-I thermonuclear burst in INTEGRAL JEM-X data. We derived a distance of 7.6+/-0.7 kpc, adopting
Eddington luminosity limited photospheric radius expansion burst emission and assuming anisotropic
emission. In the timing analysis using all NICER 1-10 keV monitoring data we observed a rather complex
behaviour starting with a spin-up period, followed by a frequency drop, a episode of constant frequency
and concluding with irregular behaviour till the end of the outburst. The 1-50 keV phase distributions
of the pulsed emission, detected up to $\sim$ 120 keV using INTEGRAL ISGRI data, was decomposed in
three Fourier harmonics showing that the pulsed fraction of the fundamental increases from ~10%
to ~17% going from ~1.5 to ~4 keV, while the harder photons arrive earlier than the soft photons for
energies <10 keV. The total emission spectrum of IGR J17591-2342 across the 0.3-150 keV band could
adequately be fitted in terms of an absorbed compPS model yielding as best fit parameters a column
density of N_H=(2.09+/-0.05) x 10^{22} /cm2, a blackbody seed photon temperature kT_bb,seed of
0.64+/- 0.02 keV, electron temperature kT_e=38.8+/-1.2 keV and Thomson optical depth Tau_T=1.59+/-0.04.
The fit normalisation results in an emission area radius of 11.3+/-0.5 km adopting a distance of
7.6 kpc. Finally, the results are discussed within the framework of accretion physics- and X-ray
thermonuclear burst theory.
