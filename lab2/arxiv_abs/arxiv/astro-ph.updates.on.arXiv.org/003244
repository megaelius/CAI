To search for giant X-ray pulses correlated with the giant radio pulses (GRPs) from the Crab pulsar,
we performed a simultaneous observation of the Crab pulsar with the X-ray satellite Hitomi in the
2 -- 300 keV band and the Kashima NICT radio observatory in the 1.4 -- 1.7 GHz band with a net exposure
of about 2 ks on 25 March 2016, just before the loss of the Hitomi mission.The timing performance of
the Hitomi instruments was confirmed to meet the timing requirement and about 1,000 and 100 GRPs
were simultaneously observed at the main and inter-pulse phases, respectively, and we found no
apparent correlation between the giant radio pulses and the X-ray emission in either the main or
inter-pulse phases.All variations are within the 2 sigma fluctuations of the X-ray fluxes at the
pulse peaks, and the 3 sigma upper limits of variations of main- or inter- pulse GRPs are 22\% or 80\%
of the peak flux in a 0.20 phase width, respectively, in the 2 -- 300 keV band.The values become 25\%
or 110\% for main or inter-pulse GRPs, respectively, when the phase width is restricted into the
0.03 phase.Among the upper limits from the Hitomi satellite, those in the 4.5-10 keV and the 70-300
keV are obtained for the first time, and those in other bands are consistent with previous reports.Numerically,
the upper limits of main- and inter-pulse GRPs in the 0.20 phase width are about (2.4 and 9.3) $\times
10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$, respectively. No significant variability in pulse profiles implies
that the GRPs originated from a local place within the magnetosphere and the number of photon-emitting
particles temporally increases.However, the results do not statistically rule out variations
correlated with the GRPs, because the possible X-ray enhancement may appear due to a $>0.02$\% brightening
of the pulse-peak flux under such conditions.
