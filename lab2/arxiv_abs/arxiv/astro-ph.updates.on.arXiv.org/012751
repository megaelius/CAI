We study six luminous Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) with very blue rest-frame UV continua at $5.7\le
z \le 6.6$. These LAEs have previous HST and Spitzer IRAC observations. Combining our newly acquired
HST images, we find that their UV-continuum slopes $\beta$ are in a range of $-3.4\le \beta \le -2.6$.
Unlike previous, tentative detections of $\beta \simeq -3$ in photometrically selected, low-luminosity
galaxies, our LAEs are spectroscopically confirmed and luminous ($M_{\rm UV}<-20$ mag). We model
their broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and find that two $\beta\simeq-2.6\pm0.2$
galaxies can be well fitted with young and dust-free stellar populations. However, it becomes increasingly
difficult to fit bluer galaxies. We explore further interpretations by including non-zero LyC
escape fraction $f_{\rm esc}$, very low metallicities, and/or AGN contributions. Assuming $f_{\rm
esc}\simeq0.2$, we achieve the bluest slopes $\beta\simeq-2.7$ when nebular emission is considered.
This can nearly explain the SEDs of two galaxies with $\beta\simeq-2.8$ and --2.9 ($\sigma_{\beta}=0.15$).
Larger $f_{\rm esc}$ values and very low metallicities are not favored by the strong nebular line
emission (evidenced by the IRAC flux) or the observed (IRAC 1 - IRAC 2) color. Finally, we find that
the $\beta\simeq-2.9$ galaxy can potentially be well explained by the combination of a very young
population with a high $f_{\rm esc}$ ($\ge0.5$) and an old, dusty population. We are not able to produce
two $\beta \simeq -3.4 \pm0.4$ galaxies. Future deep spectroscopic observations are needed to
fully understand these galaxies.
