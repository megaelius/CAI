Convective motions at the stellar surface generate a stochastic colored noise source in the radial
velocity (RV) data. This noise impedes the detection of small exoplanets. Moreover, the unknown
statistics (amplitude, distribution) related to this noise make it difficult to estimate the false
alarm probability (FAP) for exoplanet detection tests. In this paper, we investigate the possibility
of using 3D magneto-hydrodynamical simulations (MHD) of stellar convection to design detection
methods that can provide both a reliable estimate of the FAP and a high detection power. We tested
the realism of 3D simulations in producing solar RV by comparing them with the observed disk integrated
velocities taken by the GOLF instrument on board the SOHO spacecraft. We presented a new detection
method based on periodograms standardized by these simulated time series, applying several detection
tests to these standarized periodograms. The power spectral density of the 3D synthetic convective
noise is consistent with solar RV observations for short periods. For regularly sampled observations,
the analytic expressions of FAP derived for several statistical tests applied to the periodogram
standardized by 3D simulation noise are accurate. The adaptive tests considered in this work (Higher-Criticism,
Berk-Jones), which are new in the exoplanet field, may offer better detection performance than
classical tests (based on the highest periodogram value) in the case of multi-planetary systems
and planets with eccentric orbits. 3D MHD simulations are now mature enough to produce reliable
synthetic time series of the convective noise affecting RV data. These series can be used to access
to the statistics of this noise and derive accurate FAP of tests that are a critical element in the
detection of exoplanets down to the cm/s level.
