It is thought that fossil systems are relics of structure formation in the primitive Universe. They
are galaxy aggregations that have assembled their mass at high redshift with few or no subsequent
accretion. Observationally these systems are selected by large magnitude gaps between their 1st
and 2nd ranked galaxies. Nevertheless, there is still debate over whether or not this observational
criterium selects dynamically evolved ancient systems. We have studied the properties of the nearby
fossil group RXJ075243.6+455653 in order to understand the mass assembly of this system. Deep spectroscopic
observations allow us to construct the galaxy luminosity function (LF) of RXJ075243.6+455653
down to M*+ 6. The analysis of the faint-end of the LF in groups and clusters provides valuable information
about the mass assembly of the system. In addition, we have analyzed the nearby large-scale structure
around this group. We identified 26 group members within r200=0.9 Mpc. The LF of the group shows a
flat faint-end slope ( -1.08 +/- 0.33). This low density of dwarf galaxies is confirmed by the low
value of the dwarf-to-giant ratio (DGR = 0.99 +/- 0.49) for this system. Both the lack of dwarf galaxies
and the low luminosity of the BGG suggests that RXJ075243.6+455653 still has to accrete mass from
its nearby environment. This mass accretion will be achieved because it is the dominant structure
of a rich environment formed by several groups of galaxies (15) within 7 Mpc from the group center
and with +/- 1000$ km/s. RXJ075243.6+455653 is a group of galaxies that has not yet completed the
process of its mass assembly. This new mass accretion will change the fossil state of the group. This
group is an example of a galaxy aggregation selected by a large magnitude gap but still in the process
of the accretion of its mass (Abridged).
