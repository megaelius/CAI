Weak lensing surveys are reaching sensitivities at which uncertainties in the galaxy redshift
distributions n(z) from photo-z errors degrade cosmological constraints. We use ray-tracing
simulations and a simple treatment of photo-z errors to assess cosmological parameter biases from
uncertainties in n(z) in an LSST-like survey. We use the power spectrum and the abundance of lensing
peaks to infer cosmological parameters, and find that the former is somewhat more resilient to photo-z
errors. We place conservative lower limits on the survey size at which different types of photo-z
errors degrade LCDM (wCDM) parameter constraints by 50%. A residual constant photo-z bias of |dz|
< 0.003(1+z), satisfying the current LSST requirement, does not significantly degrade constraints
for surveys smaller than ~1300 (~490) square degrees using lensing peaks and ~6500 (~4900) square
degrees using the power spectrum. Adopting a recent prediction for LSST's full photo-z probability
distribution function (PDF), we find that simply approximating n(z) with the photo-z galaxy distribution
directly computed from this PDF would degrade surveys as small as ~60 (~65) square degrees using
lensing peaks or the power spectrum. Assuming that the centroid bias in each tomographic redshift
bin can be removed from the photo-z galaxy distribution, using lensing peaks or the power spectrum
still degrades surveys larger than ~200 (~255) or ~248 (~315) square degrees. These results imply
that the expected broad photo-z PDF significantly biases parameters, which needs to be further
mitigated using more sophisticated photo-z treatments.
