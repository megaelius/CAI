The astrophysical agenda of the 21st century requires a very sharp view of celestial objects. High
angular resolution studies are essential for fundamental studies of a broad variety of astrophysical
phenomena ranging from relativistic physics of black holes, their gravitational and electromagnetic
imprints, violent transient processes, including those producing detectable gravitational
waves, birth and evolution of planetary systems. Over the past decades, radio astronomy made huge
leap in achieving ground-breaking angular resolution measured in tens of microarcseconds (one
tenth of nanoradian and better). Recently a global Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration
obtained first direct images of the shadow of a super-massive black hole in the nucleus of the active
galaxy M87. These observations were conducted at 230 GHz. The two first generation Space Very Long
Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) missions, VSOP/HALCA led by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency
(JAXA) and RadioAstron led by the Russia Roscosmos State Corporation and Russia Academy of Sciences,
achieved the highest angular resolution at frequencies from 0.3 to 22 GHz in observations conducted
in the period 1997 - 2019. The next step in advancing high angular resolution radio astronomy is in
combining high frequency (millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths) and interferometric baselines
exceeding the Earth diameter. The present THEZA White Paper describes a combination which would
unify technology developments in giga-/tera-hertz instrumentation and space-borne radio astronomy.
The current preprint version of the THEZA White Paper is slightly re-formatted and edited comparing
to the official submitted version.
