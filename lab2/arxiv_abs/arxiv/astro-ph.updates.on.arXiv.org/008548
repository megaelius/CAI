Context. The properties of the accretion flow surrounding the supermassive central black hole
of the Galaxy, Sgr A*, will be scrutinized by the new-generation instrument GRAVITY and the Event
Horizon Telescope (EHT). Developing fast, robust, and simple models of such flows is thus important
and very timely. Aims. We want to model the quiescent emission of Sgr A* from radio to mid-infrared
by considering a magnetized compact torus and an extended jet. Results. We find perfect spectral
fit both for face-on and edge-on views. These best fits give parameters values very close to that
found by the most recent numerical simulations, which are much more complex than our model. The intrinsic
radio size of Sgr A* is found to be in reasonable agreement with the centimetric observed constraints.
Our best-fit infrared spectral index is in perfect agreement with the latest constraints. Our emission
region at 1.3 mm, although larger than the Doeleman et al. (2008) Gaussian best-fit, does contain
bright features at the 40 microarcsec scale. EHT-reconstructed images show that torus/jet-specific
features persist after the reconstruction procedure, and that these features are sensitive to
inclination. Conclusions. The main interest of our model is to give a simple and fast model of the
quiescent state of Sgr A*, which gives extremely similar results as compared to state-of-the-art
numerical simulations. Our model is easy to use and we publish all the material necessary to reproduce
our spectra and images, so that anyone interested can use our results rather straightforwardly.
We hope that such a public tool can be useful in the context of the recent and near-future GRAVITY and
EHT results. Our model can in particular be easily used to test alternative compact objects models,
or alternative gravity theories. The main limitation of our model is that we do not yet treat the X-ray
emission.
