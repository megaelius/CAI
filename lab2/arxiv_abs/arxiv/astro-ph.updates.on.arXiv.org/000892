The large scale structure of the Universe is characterised by a web-like structure made of voids,
sheets, filaments and knots. It has been suggested that the structure of this so-called cosmic web
is dictated by the local velocity shear tensor, and in particular that the local direction of a filament
should be strongly aligned with e3, the eigenvector associated with the smallest eigenvalue of
the shear tensor. The aim of the paper is to test that conjecture on the basis of a high resolution cosmological
simulation. The cosmic web delineated by the dark matter (DM) haloes distribution is probed by a
marked point process with interactions (the Bisous model) in order to detect filaments directly
from the dark halo distribution (the P-web). It is shown that the detected P-web filaments are strongly
aligned with the local e3 eigenvector: the alignment is within 30 degree for ~80% of the detected
elements. This result indicates that the large-scale filaments defined purely from the number
density distribution of haloes (or galaxies) carry more than just morphological information,
although the Bisous model does not make any prior assumption on the underlying shear tensor, nor
does it make any use of it. The P-web filaments are also compared to the large scale structure revealed
directly from an analysis of the velocity shear tensor (the V-web). In the densest regions, the P-
and V-web filaments overlap well (90%), whereas in lower density regions, the P-web filaments preferentially
mark regions which are collapsing in one dimension, defined to be sheets in the V-web. Further work
is needed to inspect the causes and implications of the latter result.
