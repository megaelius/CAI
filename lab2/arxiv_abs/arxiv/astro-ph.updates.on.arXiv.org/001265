We report the serendipitous discovery with XMM-Newton that 3XMM J185246.6+003317 is an 11.56 s
X-ray pulsar located 1' away from the southern boundary of supernova remnant Kes 79. The spin-down
rate of 3XMM J185246.6+003317 is $<1.1\times 10^{-13}$ s s$^{-1}$, which, together with the
long period P=11.558714(2) s, indicates a dipolar surface magnetic field of $<3.6\times 10^{-13}$
G, a characteristic age of $>1.7$ Myr, and a spin-down luminosity of $<2.8\times 10^{30}$
erg s$^{-1}$. The X-ray spectrum of the source is best-fitted with a resonant Compton scattering
model, and can be also adequately described by a blackbody model. The observations covering a seven
month span from 2008 to 2009 show variations in the spectral properties of the source, with the luminosity
decreasing from $2.8\times 10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to $4.7 \times 10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$, along with
a decrease of the blackbody temperature from $kT\approx 0.8$ keV to $\approx0.6$ keV. The X-ray
luminosity of the source is higher than its spin-down luminosity, ruling out rotation as a power
source. The combined timing and spectral properties, the non-detection of any optical or infrared
counterpart, together with the lack of detection of the source in archival X-ray data prior to the
2008 XMM-Newton observation, point to this source being a newly discovered transient low-B magnetar
undergoing an outburst decay during the XMM-Newton observations. The non-detection by Chandra
in 2001 sets an upper limit $4\times 10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to the quiescent luminosity of 3XMM J185246.6+003317.
Its period is the longest among currently known transient magnetars. The foreground absorption
toward 3XMM J185246.6+003317 is similar to that of Kes 79, suggesting a similar distance of $\sim$7.1
kpc.
