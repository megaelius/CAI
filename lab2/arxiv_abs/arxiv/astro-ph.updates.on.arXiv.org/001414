We present Stroemgren-NIR photometry of NGC6528 and its surroundings in the Baade's Window. uvby
images were collected with EFOSC2@NTT, while NIR catalogs are based on VIRCAM@VISTA and SOFI@NTT
data. The matching with HST photometry allowed us to obtain proper-motion-cleaned samples of cluster
and bulge stars. The huge color sensitivity of Stroemgren-NIR CMDs helped us in disentangling age
and metallicity effects. The RGB of NGC6528 is reproduced by scaled-solar isochrones with solar
abundance or alpha-enhanced isochrones with the same iron content, and an age of t = 11+/-1 Gyr. These
findings support literature age estimates for NGC6528. We also performed a theoretical metallicity
calibration based on the Stroemgren index m1 and on visual-NIR colors for RGs, by adopting scaled-solar
and alpha-enhanced models. We applied the calibration to estimate the metallicity of NGC6528,
finding [Fe/H] = -0.04+/-0.02, with an intrinsic dispersion of 0.27 dex (by averaging abundances
based on the scaled-solar [m], y - J and [m], y - K Metallicity-Index-Color relations), and of -0.11+/-0.01
(sig = 0.27 dex), by using the m1, y - J and m1, y - K relations. These findings support the results of
Zoccali et al. (2004) which give [Fe/H] = -0.10+/-0.2, and a low alpha-enhancement, [alpha/Fe]
= 0.1, and of Carretta et al. (2001), that find [Fe/H] = 0.07+/-0.01, with [alpha/Fe] = 0.2. By applying
the scaled-solar MIC relations to Baade's window RGs, we find a metallicity distribution extending
from [Fe/H] ~ -1.0 to ~ 1 dex, with peaks at [Fe/H] ~ -0.2 and +0.55 ([m], y - J and [m], y - K relations),
and [Fe/H] ~ -0.25 and +0.4 (m1, y - J and m1, y - K relations). These findings are in good agreement with
the spectroscopic studies of Hill et al. (2011) for the Baade's window, of Uttenthaler et al. (2012)
for a region centered at (l,b) = (0, -10), and with the results of the ARGOS survey (Ness et al. 2013a).
