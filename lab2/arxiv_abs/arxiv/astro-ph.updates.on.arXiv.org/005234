We present the first comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the rest-frame UV spectroscopic properties
of star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2-4. We match samples at different redshifts in UV luminosity and
stellar mass, and perform systematic measurements of spectral features and stellar population
modeling. By creating composite spectra grouped according to Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW),
and various galaxy properties, we study the evolutionary trends among Ly$\alpha$, low- and high-ionization
interstellar (LIS and HIS) absorption features, and integrated galaxy properties. We also examine
the redshift evolution of Ly$\alpha$ and LIS absorption kinematics, and fine-structure emission
EWs. The connections among the strengths of Ly$\alpha$, LIS lines, and dust extinction are redshift-independent,
as is the decoupling of Ly$\alpha$ and HIS line strengths, and the bulk outflow kinematics as traced
by LIS lines. Stronger Ly$\alpha$ emission is observed at higher redshift at fixed UV luminosity,
stellar mass, SFR, and age. Much of this variation in average Ly$\alpha$ strength with redshift,
and the variation in Ly$\alpha$ strength at fixed redshift, can be explained in terms of variations
in neutral gas covering fraction and/or dust content in the ISM and CGM. However, based on the connection
between Ly$\alpha$ and CIII] emission strengths, we additionally find evidence for variations
in the intrinsic production rate of Ly$\alpha$ photons at the highest Ly$\alpha$ EWs. The challenge
now is to understand the observed evolution in neutral gas covering fraction and dust extinction
within a coherent model for galaxy formation, and make robust predictions for the escape of ionizing
radiation at z > 6.
