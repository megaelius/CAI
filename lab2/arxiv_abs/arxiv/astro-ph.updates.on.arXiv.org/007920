We aim to constrain massive star evolution models using the unique testbed eclipsing binary HD166734
with new grids of MESA stellar evolution models, adopting calibrated prescriptions of overshooting,
mass loss, and rotation. We introduce a novel tool: the "mass-luminosity plane" or "M-L plane",
as an equivalent to the traditional HR diagram, utilising it to reproduce the testbed binary HD166734
with newly calibrated MESA stellar evolution models for single stars. We can only reproduce the
Galactic binary system with an enhanced amount of core overshooting (alpha = 0.5), mass loss, and
rotational mixing. We can utilise the gradient in the M-L plane to constrain the amount of mass loss
to 0.5 - 1.5 times the standard Vink et al. 2001 prescriptions, and we can exclude extreme reduction
or multiplication factors. The extent of the vectors in the M-L plane leads us to conclude that the
amount of core overshooting is larger than is normally adopted in contemporary massive star evolution
models. We furthermore conclude that rotational mixing is mandatory to get the nitrogen abundance
ratios between the primary and secondary components to be correct (3:1) in our testbed binary system.
Our calibrated grid of models, alongside our new M-L plane approach, present the possibility of
a widened main sequence due to an increased demand for core overshooting. The increased amount of
core overshooting is not only needed to explain the extended main sequence, but the enhanced overshooting
is also needed to explain the location of the upper-luminosity limit of the red supergiants. Finally,
the increased amount of core overshooting has -- via the compactness parameter -- implications
for supernova explodibility.
