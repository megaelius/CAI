We derive full-sky, real-space operators that convert between polarization Stokes Q/U parameters
and the coordinate-independent scalar E/B modes that are widely used in Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) and cosmic shear analysis. We also derive real space operators that decompose the measured
Stokes parameters into those corresponding to E-modes and B-modes respectively, without ever
evaluating the scalar fields themselves. For all these real space operators we show that the kernels
split naturally into angular and radial parts and we show explicitly how the radial extent of these
kernels depends on the targeted band-limit. The kernels can be interpreted either as a complex convolving
beam or as a Green's function when they are expressed in terms of the forward or inverse rotation Euler
angles. We show that an arbitrary radial function can produce E/B-like maps, provided it vanishes
at the origin and the antipodal point. These maps are simply filtered versions of the standard E/B
maps. We argue that it is possible compute E/B maps in real space with a compactly-supported kernel,
an approach that can guarantee the avoidance of known foreground regions and could be employed in
a massively-parallel scheme at high-resolution. We show that the spin raising and lowering operators
$\eth^2$/$\bar{\eth}^2$ are special cases of these generalized radial functions, and present
their band limited versions. The spatial structure of the real space operators provides great intuition
for the E/B structure of polarized, filamentary galactic foregrounds. We predict a non-zero B-mode
signature that is expected from polarized filaments in the sky. This paper is the first part in a series
of papers that explore real-space computation of polarization modes and their applications.
