We present a study of NGC 4993, the host galaxy of the GW170817 gravitational wave event, the GRB170817A
short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) and the AT2017gfo kilonova. We use Dark Energy Camera imaging, AAT
spectra and publicly available data, relating our findings to binary neutron star (BNS) formation
scenarios and merger delay timescales. NGC4993 is a nearby (40 Mpc) early-type galaxy, with $i$-band
S\'ersic index $n=4.0$ and low asymmetry ($A=0.04\pm 0.01$). These properties are unusual for
sGRB hosts. However, NGC4993 presents shell-like structures and dust lanes indicative of a recent
galaxy merger, with the optical transient located close to a shell. We constrain the star formation
history (SFH) of the galaxy assuming that the galaxy merger produced a star formation burst, but
find little to no on-going star formation in either spatially-resolved broadband SED or spectral
fitting. We use the best-fit SFH to estimate the BNS merger rate in this type of galaxy, as $R_{NSM}^{gal}=
5.7^{+0.57}_{-3.3} \times 10^{-6} {\rm yr}^{-1}$. If star formation is the only considered BNS
formation scenario, the expected number of BNS mergers from early-type galaxies detectable with
LIGO during its first two observing seasons is $0.038^{+0.004}_{-0.022}$, as opposed to $\sim
0.5$ from all galaxy types. Hypothesizing that the binary system formed due to dynamical interactions
during the galaxy merger, the subsequent time elapsed can constrain the delay time of the BNS coalescence.
By using velocity dispersion estimates and the position of the shells, we find that the galaxy merger
occurred $t_{\rm mer}\lesssim 200~{\rm Myr}$ prior to the BNS coalescence.
