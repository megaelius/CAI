We report 850~$\mu$m dust polarization observations of a low-mass ($\sim$12 $M_{\odot}$) starless
core in the $\rho$ Ophiuchus cloud, Ophiuchus C, made with the POL-2 instrument on the James Clerk
Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) as part of the JCMT B-fields In STar-forming Region Observations (BISTRO)
survey. We detect an ordered magnetic field projected on the plane of sky in the starless core. The
magnetic field across the $\sim$0.1~pc core shows a predominant northeast-southwest orientation
centering between $\sim$40$^\circ$ to $\sim$100$^\circ$, indicating that the field in the core
is well aligned with the magnetic field in lower-density regions of the cloud probed by near-infrared
observations and also the cloud-scale magnetic field traced by Planck observations. The polarization
percentage ($P$) decreases with an increasing total intensity ($I$) with a power-law index of $-$1.03
$\pm$ 0.05. We estimate the plane-of-sky field strength ($B_{\mathrm{pos}}$) using modified
Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) methods based on structure function (SF), auto-correlation
(ACF), and unsharp masking (UM) analyses. We find that the estimates from the SF, ACF, and UM methods
yield strengths of 103 $\pm$ 46 $\mu$G, 136 $\pm$ 69 $\mu$G, and 213 $\pm$ 115 $\mu$G, respectively.
Our calculations suggest that the Ophiuchus C core is near magnetically critical or slightly magnetically
supercritical (i.e. unstable to collapse). The total magnetic energy calculated from the SF method
is comparable to the turbulent energy in Ophiuchus C, while the ACF method and the UM method only set
upper limits for the total magnetic energy because of large uncertainties.
