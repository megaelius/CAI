We present the new Alfven Wave Solar Model (AWSoM), a global model from the upper chromosphere to
the corona and the heliosphere. The coronal heating and solar wind acceleration are addressed with
low-frequency Alfven wave turbulence. The injection of Alfven wave energy at the inner boundary
is such that the Poynting flux is proportional to the magnetic field strength. The three-dimensional
magnetic field topology is simulated using data from photospheric magnetic field measurements.
This model does not impose open-closed magnetic field boundaries; those develop self-consistently.
The physics includes: (1) The model employs three different temperatures, namely the isotropic
electron temperature and the parallel and perpendicular ion temperatures. The firehose, mirror,
and ion-cyclotron instabilities due to the developing ion temperature anisotropy are accounted
for. (2) The Alfven waves are partially reflected by the Alfven speed gradient and the vorticity
along the field lines. The resulting counter-propagating waves are responsible for the nonlinear
turbulent cascade. The balanced turbulence due to uncorrelated waves near the apex of the closed
field lines and the resulting elevated temperatures are addressed. (3) To apportion the wave dissipation
to the three temperatures, we employ the results of the theories of linear wave damping and nonlinear
stochastic heating. (4) We have incorporated the collisional and collisionless electron heat
conduction. We compare the simulated multi-wavelength EUV images of CR2107 with the observations
from STEREO/EUVI and SDO/AIA instruments. We demonstrate that the reflection due to strong magnetic
fields in proximity of active regions intensifies the dissipation and observable emission sufficiently.
