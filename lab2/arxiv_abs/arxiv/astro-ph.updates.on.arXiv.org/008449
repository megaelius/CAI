During a solar flare, it is believed that reconnection takes place in the corona followed by fast
energy transport to the chromosphere. The resulting intense heating strongly disturbs the chromospheric
structure, and induces complex radiation hydrodynamic effects. Interpreting the physics of the
flaring solar atmosphere is one of the most challenging tasks in solar physics. Here we present a
novel deep learning approach, an invertible neural network, to understanding the chromospheric
physics of a flaring solar atmosphere via the inversion of observed solar line profiles in H{\alpha}
and Ca II {\lambda}8542. Our network is trained using flare simulations from the 1D radiation hydrodynamics
code RADYN as the expected atmosphere and line profile. This model is then applied to single pixels
from an observation of an M1.1 solar flare taken with SST/CRISP instrument just after the flare onset.
The inverted atmospheres obtained from observations provide physical information on the electron
number density, temperature and bulk velocity flow of the plasma throughout the solar atmosphere
ranging from 0-10 Mm in height. The density and temperature profiles appear consistent with the
expected atmospheric response, and the bulk plasma velocity provides the gradients needed to produce
the broad spectral lines whilst also predicting the expected chromospheric evaporation from flare
heating. We conclude that we have taught our novel algorithm the physics of a solar flare according
to RADYN and that this can be confidently used for the analysis of flare data taken in these two wavelengths.
This algorithm can also be adapted for a menagerie of inverse problems providing extremely fast
($\sim$10 {\mu}s) inversion samples.
