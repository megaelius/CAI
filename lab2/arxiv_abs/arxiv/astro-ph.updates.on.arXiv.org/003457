We present multi-epoch, $R-$band imaging obtained from the Palomar Transient Factory of a small,
fan-shaped reflection nebula in NGC 1333 that experiences prominent brightness fluctuations.
Photometry of HBC 340 (K7e) and HBC 341 (M5e), a visual pair of late-type, young stellar objects lying
near the apex of the nebula, demonstrates that while both are variable, the former has brightened
by more than two magnitudes following a deep local minimum in September 2014. Keck high dispersion
(R$\sim$45,000-66,000), optical spectroscopy of HBC 340 suggests that the protostar is a spectroscopic
binary (HBC 340Aa + HBC 340Ab). Both HBC 340 and HBC 341 exhibit strong H$\alpha$ and forbidden line
emission, consistent with accretion and outflow. We conclude that the brightness fluctuations
in the reflection nebula represent light echos produced by varying incident radiation emanating
from HBC 340. The short-term variability observed in the protostar is attributed to irregular accretion
activity, while correlated, dipping behavior on a several hundred day time scale may be due to eclipse-like
events caused by orbiting circumstellar material. Archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging of
the region reveals a second, faint (F814W$\sim$20.3 mag) companion to HBC 340 that lies 1.02" ($\sim$235
AU) east of the protostar. If associated, this probable substellar mass object (20-50 Jupiter masses),
HBC 340B, is likely unrelated to the observed brightness variations. The sustained brightening
of HBC 340 since late 2014 can be explained by an EXor-like outburst, the recovery from a long duration
eclipse event caused by obscuring circumstellar dust, or by the gradual removal of extincting material
from along the line of sight. Our analysis here favors one of the extinction scenarios.
