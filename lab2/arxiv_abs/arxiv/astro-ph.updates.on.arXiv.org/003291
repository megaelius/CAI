We present an example of an interpolation code of the SAHA-S equation of state that has been adapted
for use in the stellar evolution code CESAM2k. The aim is to provide the necessary data and numerical
procedures for its implementation in a stellar code. A technical problem is the discrepancy between
the sets of thermodynamic quantities provided by the SAHA-S equation of state and those necessary
in the CESAM2k computations. Moreover, the independent variables in a practical equation of state
(like SAHA-S) are temperature and density, whereas for modelling calculations the variables temperature
and pressure are preferable. Specifically for the CESAM2k code, some additional quantities and
their derivatives must be provided. To provide the bridge between the equation of state and stellar
modelling, we prepare auxiliary tables of the quantities that are demanded in CESAM2k. Then we use
cubic spline interpolation to provide both smoothness and a good approximation of the necessary
derivatives. Using the B-form of spline representation provides us with an efficient algorithm
for three-dimensional interpolation. The table of B-spline coefficients provided can be directly
used during stellar model calculations together with the module of cubic spline interpolation.
This implementation of the SAHA-S equation of state in the CESAM2k stellar structure and evolution
code has been tested on a solar model evolved to the present. A comparison with other equations of
state is briefly discussed. The choice of a regular net of mesh points for specific primary quantities
in the SAHA-S equation of state, together with accurate and consistently smooth tabulated values,
provides an effective algorithm of interpolation in modelling calculations. The proposed module
of interpolation procedures can be easily adopted in other evolution codes.
