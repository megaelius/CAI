Condensate clouds strongly impact the spectra of brown dwarfs and exoplanets. Recent discoveries
of variable L/T transition dwarfs argued for patchy clouds in at least some ultracool atmospheres.
This study aims to measure the frequency and level of spectral variability in brown dwarfs and to
search for correlations with spectral type. We used HST/WFC3 to obtain spectroscopic time series
for 22 brown dwarfs of spectral types ranging from L5 to T6 at 1.1-1.7 $\mu$m for $\approx$40 min per
object. Using Bayesian analysis, we find 6 brown dwarfs with confident $(p>95\%)$ variability
in the relative flux in at least one wavelength region at sub-percent precision, and 5 brown dwarfs
with tentative $(p>68\%)$ variability. We derive a minimum variability fraction $f_{min}=27^{+11}_{-7}\%$
over all covered spectral types. The fraction of variables is equal within errors for mid L, late
L and mid T spectral types; for early T dwarfs we do not find any confident variable but the sample is
too small to derive meaningful limits. For some objects, the variability occurs primarily in the
flux peak in the J or H band, others are variable throughout the spectrum or only in specific absorption
regions. Four sources may have broad-band peak-to-peak amplitudes exceeding 1%. Our measurements
are not sensitive to very long periods, inclinations near pole-on and rotationally symmetric heterogeneity.
The detection statistics are consistent with most brown dwarf photospheres being patchy. While
multiple-percent near-infrared variability may be rare and confined to the L/T transition, low-level
heterogeneities are a frequent characteristic of brown dwarf atmospheres.
