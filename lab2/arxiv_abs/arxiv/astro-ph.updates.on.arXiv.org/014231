In the Solar System, minor bodies and dust deliver various materials to planetary surfaces. Several
exoplanetary systems are known to host inner and outer belts, analogues of the main asteroid belt
and the Kuiper belt. We study the possibility that exominor bodies and exodust deliver volatiles
and refractories to the exoplanets in the system HR8799 by performing N-body simulations. The model
consists of the host star, four giant planets (HR8799 e, d, c, and b), 650000 test particles representing
the inner belt, and 1450000 test particles representing the outer belt. Moreover we modelled dust
populations that originate from both belts. Within a million years, the two belts evolve towards
the expected dynamical structure (also derived in other works), where mean-motion resonances
with the planets carve the analogues of Kirkwood gaps. We find that, after this point, the planets
suffer impacts by objects from the inner and outer belt at rates that are essentially constant with
time, while dust populations do not contribute significantly to the delivery process. We convert
the impact rates to volatile and refractory delivery rates using our best estimates of the total
mass contained in the belts and their volatile and refractory content. Over their lifetime, the
four giant planets receive between $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}M_\bigoplus$ of material from both belts.
The total amount of delivered volatiles and refractories, ${5\times10^{-3}\textrm{M}_\bigoplus}$,
is small compared to the total mass of the planets, $11\times10^{3}\textrm{M}_\bigoplus$. However,
if the planets were formed to be volatile-rich, their exogenous enrichment in refractory material
may well be significant and observable, for example with JWST-MIRI. If terrestrial planets exist
within the snow line of the system, volatile delivery would be an important astrobiological mechanism
and may be observable as atmospheric trace gases.
