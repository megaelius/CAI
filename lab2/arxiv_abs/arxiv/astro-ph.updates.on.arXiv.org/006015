G326.3$-$1.8 (also known as MSH 15$-$56) has been detected in radio as a middle-aged composite supernova
remnant (SNR) consisting of an SNR shell and a pulsar wind nebula (PWN), which has been crushed by
the SNR's reverse shock. Previous $\gamma$-ray studies of SNR G326.3$-$1.8 revealed bright and
extended emission with uncertain origin. Understanding the nature of the $\gamma$-ray emission
allows probing the population of high-energy particles (leptons or hadrons) but can be challenging
for sources of small angular extent. With the recent $\textit{Fermi}$ Large Area Telescope data
release Pass 8, we investigate the morphology of this SNR to disentangle the PWN from the SNR contribution.
We perform a morphological and spectral analysis from 300 MeV to 300 GeV. We use the reconstructed
events with the best angular resolution to separately investigate the PWN and the SNR emissions,
which is crucial to accurately determine the spectral properties of G326.3$-$1.8 and understand
its nature. The centroid of the $\gamma$-ray emission evolves with energy and is spatially coincident
with the radio PWN at high energies (E $>$ 3 GeV). The morphological analysis reveals that a model
considering two contributions from the SNR and the PWN reproduces the $\gamma$-ray data better
than a single-component model. The associated spectral analysis using power laws shows two distinct
spectral features, a softer spectrum for the remnant ($\Gamma$ = 2.17 $\pm$ 0.06) and a harder spectrum
for the PWN ($\Gamma$ = 1.79 $\pm$ 0.12), consistent with hadronic and leptonic origin for the SNR
and the PWN respectively. Focusing on the SNR spectrum, we use one-zone models to derive some physical
properties and, in particular, we find that the emission is best explained with a hadronic scenario
in which the large target density is provided by radiative shocks in HI clouds struck by the SNR.
