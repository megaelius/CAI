WASP-52b is a low density hot Jupiter orbiting a moderately active K2V star. Previous low-resolution
studies have revealed a cloudy atmosphere and found atomic Na above the cloud deck. Here we report
the detection of excess absorption at the Na doublet, the H$\alpha$ line, and the K D$_1$ line. We
derived a high-resolution transmission spectrum based on three transits of WASP-52b, observed
with the ultra stable, high-resolution spectrograph ESPRESSO at the VLT. We measure a line contrast
of $1.09\pm 0.16$% for Na D$_1$, $1.31\pm 0.13$% for Na D$_2$, $0.86\pm 0.13$% for H$\alpha$, and
$0.46\pm 0.13$% for K D$_1$, with a line FWHM range of 11-22 km s$^{-1}$. We also find that the velocity
shift of these detected lines during the transit is consistent with the planet orbital motion, thus
confirming their planetary origin. We do not observe any significant net blueshift or redshift
that can be attributed to planetary winds. We use activity indicator lines as control but find no
excess absorption. However, we do notice signatures arising from the Center-to-Limb variation
(CLV) and the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect at these control lines. This highlights the importance
of the CLV+RM correction in correctly deriving the transmission spectrum, which, if not corrected,
could resemble or cancel out planetary absorption in certain cases. WASP-52b is the second non-ultra-hot
Jupiter to show excess H$\alpha$ absorption, after HD 189733b. Future observations targeting
non-ultra-hot Jupiters that show H$\alpha$ could help reveal the relation between stellar activity
and the heating processes in the planetary upper atmosphere.
