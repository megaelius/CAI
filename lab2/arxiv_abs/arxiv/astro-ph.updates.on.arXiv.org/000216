AGN jets carry more than sufficient energy to stave off catastrophic cooling of the intracluster
medium (ICM) in the cores of cool-core clusters. However, in order to prevent catastrophic cooling,
the ICM must be heated in a near-isotropic fashion and narrow bipolar jets with $P_{\rm jet}=10^{44-45}$
ergs/s, typical of radio AGNs at cluster centres, are inefficient at heating the gas in the transverse
direction to the jets. We argue that due to existent conditions in cluster cores, the SMBHs will,
in addition to accreting gas via radiatively inefficient flows, experience short stochastic episodes
of enhanced accretion via thin discs. In general, the orientation of these accretion discs will
be misaligned with the spin axis of the black holes and the ensuing torques will cause the black hole's
spin axis (and therefore, the jet axis) to slew and rapidly change direction. This model not only
explains recent observations showing successive generations of jet-lobes-bubbles in individual
cool-core clusters that are offset from each other in the angular direction with respect to the cluster
center, but also shows that AGN jets {\it can} heat the cluster core nearly isotropically on the gas
cooling timescale. Our model {\it does} require that the SMBHs at the centers of cool-core clusters
be spinning relatively slowly. Torques from individual misaligned discs are ineffective at tilting
rapidly spinning black holes by more than a few degrees. Additionally, since SMBHs that host thin
accretion discs will manifest as quasars, we predict that roughly 1--2 rich clusters within $z<0.5$
should have quasars at their centers.
