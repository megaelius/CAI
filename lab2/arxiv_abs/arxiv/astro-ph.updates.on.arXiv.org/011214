Radio galaxies host relativistic jets oriented away from our line of sight, making them challenging
targets for Very High Energy (VHE, E$>$100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray detectors. Indeed, out of $\sim100$
extragalactic sources detected at $E>100$ GeV, only six are radio galaxies. The new Cherenkov Telescope
Array (CTA) will provide order-of-magnitude improvements in sensitivity with respect to the present
generation of ground-based $\gamma$-ray observatories, opening new frontiers for high-energy
studies of radio galaxies. In a previous paper, we studied the CTA detection prospects of misaligned
jets from the Third Fermi-LAT catalog (3FGL) sample. In this work, we take advantage of the expanded
sample from the Fourth Fermi-LAT catalog (4FGL), including roughly double the number of sources.
We simulate CTA observations of 41 $\gamma$-ray radio galaxies, extrapolating their GeV spectrum
into the TeV range assuming different spectral shapes. We predict that the CTA will detect eleven
new TeV radio galaxies with an observational campaign of 50 hours per source, under the realistic
assumption of a spectral cutoff at 0.5 TeV. This would increase the sample of VHE radio galaxies by
a factor of three, and result in the first detection of FR II radio galaxies at these energies. By simulating
CTA observations with 5 hours exposure, we predict that two Fermi-LAT radio galaxies should already
be within reach of current TeV observatories. Finally we have investigated the prospects for a CTA
detection of extended VHE emission from the lobe-dominated FR I Fornax A, and predict that this will
be possible for integration times $\gtrsim\!50$ hours. We conclude that the CTA will significantly
impact our understanding of misaligned jets at TeV energies, allowing us to perform population
studies and compare the two main radio galaxy subclasses for the first time in this energy band.
