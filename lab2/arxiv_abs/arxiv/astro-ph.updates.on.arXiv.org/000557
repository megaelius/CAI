New integral field spectroscopy (IFS) has been obtained for the nearby metal-poor WR galaxy Mrk178
to examine the spatial correlation between its WR stars and the neighbouring ionized ISM. The strength
of the broad WR features and its low metallicity make Mrk178 an intriguing object. We have detected
the blue and red WR bumps in different locations across the FOV (~ 300 pc x 230 pc) in Mrk178. The study
of the WR content has been extended, for the first time, beyond its brightest star-forming knot uncovering
new WR star-clusters. Using SMC/LMC-template WR stars we empirically estimate a minimum of ~ 20
WR stars within the region sampled. Maps of the spatial distribution of the emission-lines and of
the physical-chemical properties of the ionized ISM have been created and analyzed. Here we refine
the statistical methodology by Perez-Montero et al.(2011) to probe the presence of variations
in the ISM properties. An error-weighted mean of 12+log(O/H)=7.72 +/- 0.01 is taken as the representative
oxygen abundance for Mrk178. A localized N and He enrichment, spatially correlated with WR stars,
is suggested by this analysis. Nebular HeII4686 emission is shown to be spatially extended reaching
well beyond the location of the WR stars. This spatial offset between WRs and HeII emission can be
explained based on the mechanical energy input into the ISM by the WR star winds, and does not rule
out WR stars as the HeII ionization source. We study systematic aperture effects on the detection
and measurement of the WR features, using SDSS spectra combined with the power of IFS. In this regard,
the importance of targeting low metallicity nearby systems is discussed.
