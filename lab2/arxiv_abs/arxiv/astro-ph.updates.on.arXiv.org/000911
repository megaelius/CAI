By exploiting the database of early-type galaxies (ETGs) members of the WINGS survey of nearby clusters,
we address here the long debated question of the origin and shape of the Fundamental Plane (FP). Our
data suggest that different physical mechanisms concur in shaping and tilting the FP with respect
to the virial plane (VP) expectation. In particular, an hybrid solution in which the structure of
galaxies and their stellar population are the main contributors to the FP tilt seems to be favoured.
We find that the bulk of the tilt should be attributed to structural non-homology, while stellar
population effects play an important but less crucial role. Our data indicate that the differential
FP tilt between the V and K-band is due to a sort of entanglement between structural and stellar population
effects, for which the inward steepening of color profiles (V-K) tends to increase at increasing
the stellar mass of ETGs. The same analysis applied to the ATLAS3D and SDSS data in common with WINGS
(WSDSS throughout the paper) confirms our results, the only remarkable difference being the less
important role of the stellar mass-to-light-ratio in determining the FP tilt. The ATLAS3D data
also suggest that the tilt depends as well on the dark matter (DM) fraction and on the rotational contribution
to the kinetic energy (Vrot/sigma). We show that the global properties of the FP can be understood
in terms of the underlying correlation among mass, structure and stellar population of ETGs, for
which, at increasing the stellar mass, ETGs become (on average) older and more centrally concentrated.
Finally, we show that a Malmquist-like selection effect may mimic a differential evolution of the
mass-to-light ratio for galaxies of different masses. This should be taken into account in the studies
investigating the amount of the so called downsizing phenomenon.
