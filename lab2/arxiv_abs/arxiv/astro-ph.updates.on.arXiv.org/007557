Advanced LIGO and Virgo have so far detected gravitational waves from 6 binary black hole mergers
(BBH) and 1 binary neutron star merger (BNS). In the future, we expect the detection of many more marginal
sources, since compact binary coalescences detectable by advanced ground-based instruments
are roughly distributed uniformly in comoving volume. In this paper we simulate weak signals from
compact binary coalescences of various morphologies and optimal network signal-to-noise ratios
(henceforth SNRs), and analyze if and to which extent their parameters can be measured by advanced
LIGO and Virgo in their third observing run. Since the Fisher matrix approximation fails at small
SNRs, we perform full numerical simulations. We show that sub-threshold binary neutron stars,
with SNRs below 12 (10) yield uncertainties in their sky position larger than 400 (700) deg$^2$ (90%
credible interval). The luminosity distance, which could be used to measure the Hubble constant
with standard sirens, has relative uncertainties larger than 40% for BNSs and neutron star black
hole mergers. For sources with SNRs below 8, it is not uncommon that the extrinsic parameters, sky
position and distance, cannot be measured. Next, we look at the intrinsic parameters, masses and
spins. We show that the chirp mass can sometimes be measured with uncertainties below $1%$ even for
sources at SNRs of 6, although multimodality is not uncommon and can significantly broaden the posteriors.
The effective inspiral spin is best measured for neutron star black hole mergers, for which the uncertainties
can be as low as $\sim0.08$ ($\sim 0.2$) at SNR 12 (8). The uncertainty is higher for systems with comparable
component masses or lack of spin precession.
