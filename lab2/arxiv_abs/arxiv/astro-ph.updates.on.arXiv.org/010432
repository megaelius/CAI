Multimessenger observations of the neutron star merger GW170817 and its kilonova proved that neutron
star mergers can synthesize large quantities of r-process elements. If neutron star mergers in
fact dominate all r-process element production, then the distribution of kilonova ejecta compositions
should match the distribution of r-process abundance patterns observed in stars. The lanthanide
fraction (XLa) is a measurable quantity in both kilonovae and metal-poor stars, but it has not previously
been explicitly calculated for stars. Here, we compute the lanthanide fraction distribution of
metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] < -2.5) to enable comparison to current and future kilonovae. The full
distribution peaks at log XLa ~ -1.8, but r-process-enhanced stars ([Eu/Fe] > 0.7) have distinctly
higher lanthanide fractions; log XLa > -1.5. We review observations of GW170817 and find general
consensus that the total log XLa = -2.2 +/- 0.5, somewhat lower than the typical metal-poor star and
inconsistent with the most highly r-enhanced stars. For neutron star mergers to remain viable as
the dominant r-process site, future kilonova observations should be preferentially lanthanide-rich
(including a population of ~10% with log XLa > -1.5). These high-XLa kilonovae may be fainter and
more rapidly evolving than GW170817, posing a challenge for discovery and follow-up observations.
Both optical and (mid-)infrared observations will be required to robustly constrain kilonova
lanthanide fractions. If such high-XLa kilonovae are not found in the next few years, that likely
implies that the stars with the highest r-process enhancements have a different origin for their
r-process elements.
