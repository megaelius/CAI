HD49330 is a Be star that underwent an outburst during its five-month observation with the CoRoT
satellite. An analysis of its light curve revealed several independent p and g pulsation modes,
in addition to showing that the amplitude of the modes is directly correlated with the outburst.
We modelled the results obtained with CoRoT. We modelled the flattening of the structure of the star
due to rapid rotation in two ways: Chandrasekhar-Milne's expansion and 2D structure computed with
ROTORC. We then modelled kappa-driven pulsations. We also adapted the formalism of the excitation
and amplitude of stochastically excited gravito-inertial modes to rapidly rotating stars, and
we modelled those pulsations as well. We find that while pulsation p modes are excited by the kappa
mechanism, the observed g modes are a result of stochastic excitation. In contrast, g and r waves
are stochastically excited in the convective core and transport angular momentum to the surface,
increasing its rotation rate. This destabilises the external layers of the star, which then emits
transient stochastically excited g waves. These transient waves produce most of the low-frequency
signal detected in the CoRoT data and ignite the outburst. During this unstable phase, p modes disappear
at the surface because their cavity is broken. Following the outburst and ejection of the surface
layer, relaxation occurs, making the transient g waves disappear and p modes reappear. This work
includes the first coherent model of stochastically excited gravito-inertial pulsation modes
in a rapidly rotating Be star. It provides an explanation for the correlation between the variation
in the amplitude of frequencies detected in the CoRoT data and the occurrence of an outburst. This
scenario could apply to other pulsating Be stars, providing an explanation to the long-standing
questions surrounding Be outbursts and disks.
