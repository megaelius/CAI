The X-ray pulsar GRO J1744-28 is a unique source which shows both pulsations and type-II X-ray bursts,
allowing studies of the interaction of the accretion disk with the magnetosphere at huge mass accretion
rates exceeding $10^{19}$ g s$^{-1}$ during its super-Eddington outbursts. The magnetic field
strength in the source, $B\approx 5\times 10^{11}$ G, is known from the cyclotron absorption feature
discovered in the energy spectrum around 4.5 keV. Here, we explore the flux variability of the source
in context of interaction of its magnetosphere with the radiation-pressure dominated accretion
disk. Particularly, we present the results of the analysis of noise power density spectra (PDS)
using the observations of the source in 1996-1997 by RXTE. Accreting compact objects commonly exhibit
a broken power-law shape of the PDS with a break corresponding to the Keplerian orbital frequency
of matter at the innermost disk radius. The observed frequency of the break can thus be used to estimate
the size of the magnetosphere. We found, however, that the observed PDS of GRO J1744-28 differs dramatically
from the canonical shape. Furthermore, the observed break frequency appears to be significantly
higher than what is expected based on the magnetic field estimated from the cyclotron line energy.
We argue that these observational facts can be attributed to the existence of the radiation-pressure
dominated region in the accretion disk at luminosities above $\sim$2$\times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$.
We discuss a qualitative model for the PDS formation in such disks, and show that its predictions
are consistent with our observational findings. The presence of the radiation-pressure dominated
region can also explain the observed weak luminosity-dependence of the inner radius, and we argue
that the small inner radius can be explained by a quadrupole component dominating the magnetic field
of the neutron star.
