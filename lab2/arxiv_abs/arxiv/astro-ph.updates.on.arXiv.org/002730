The dominant form of nitrogen provided to most solar system bodies is currently unknown, though
available measurements show that the detected nitrogen in solar system rocks and ices is depleted
with respect to solar abundances and the interstellar medium. We use a detailed chemical/physical
model of the chemical evolution of a protoplanetary disk to explore the evolution and abundance
of nitrogen-bearing molecules. Based on this model we analyze how initial chemical abundances,
provided as either gas or ice during the early stages of disk formation, influence which species
become the dominant nitrogen bearers at later stages. We find that a disk with the majority of its
initial nitrogen in either atomic or molecular nitrogen is later dominated by atomic and molecular
nitrogen as well as NH$_{3}$ and HCN ices, where the dominant species varies with disk radius. When
nitrogen is initially in gaseous ammonia, it later becomes trapped in ammonia ice except in the outer
disk where atomic nitrogen dominates. For a disk with the initial nitrogen in the form of ammonia
ice the nitrogen remains trapped in the ice as NH$_{3}$ at later stages. The model in which most of
the initial nitrogen is placed in atomic N best matches the ammonia abundances observed in comets.
Furthermore the initial state of nitrogen influences the abundance of N$_{2}$H$^{+}$, which has
been detected in protoplanetary disks. Strong N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ emission is found to be indicative
of an N$_{2}$ abundance greater than $n_{\mathrm{N_{2}}}/n_{\mathrm{H_{2}}}>10^{-6}$,
in addition to tracing the CO snow line. Our models also indicate that NO is potentially detectable,
with lower N gas abundances leading to higher NO abundances.
