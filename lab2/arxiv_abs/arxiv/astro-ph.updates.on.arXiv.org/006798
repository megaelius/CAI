We search for correlations between the [OI]6300 line, a well-known tracer of jets and winds in young
stars, and stellar/disk/accretion properties in the young cluster NGC 2264, aiming to characterize
the outflow phenomena that occur within the circumstellar environment. We analyzed FLAMES spectra
of 184 stars, detecting the [OI]6300 line in 108 CTTSs and 2 Herbig AeBe stars. We identified the main
features of this line: a high-velocity component (HVC), and a broad and narrow low-velocity components
(BLVC and NLVC). We calculated their luminosities and kinematic properties, then compared with
stellar/accretion parameters. The luminosity of the [OI]6300 line correlates positively with
the stellar and accretion luminosity. The HVC is only detected among systems with optically thick
inner disks; the BLVC is found in thick disk systems and few systems with anemic disks; and the NLVC
is common among systems with all types of disks. Our BLVCs present blueshifts of up to 50km/s and widths
compatible with an origin 0.05au-0.5au from the star, while the NLVCs in our sample have widths compatible
with an origin between 0.5au and 5au, in agreement with previous studies in Taurus. The HVC is found
most often among sources with irregular, aperiodic photometric variability, usually associated
with accretion in an unstable regime. No stellar properties appear to significantly influence
any property of these jets. We find jet velocities on average similar to those found in Taurus. We
confirm earlier findings in Taurus which favor an inner MHD disk wind as the origin of the BLVC, while
there is no conclusive evidence that the NLVC traces photoevaporative disk winds. The [OI]6300
line profile shows signs of evolving as the disk disperses, with the HVC and BLVC disappearing as
the inner disk becomes optically thin, in support of the scenario of inside-out gas dissipation
in the inner disk.
