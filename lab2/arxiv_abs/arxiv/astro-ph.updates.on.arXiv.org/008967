The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is an essential input for many astrophysical studies but
only in a few cases it has been determined over the whole cluster mass range, limiting the conclusions
about its nature. The 25 Orionis group (25 Ori) is an excellent laboratory to investigate the IMF
across the entire mass range of the population, from planetary-mass objects to intermediate/high-mass
stars. We combine new deep optical photometry with optical and near-infrared data from the literature
to select 1687 member candidates covering a 1.1$^\circ$ radius area in 25 Ori. With this sample we
derived the 25 Ori system IMF from 0.012 to 13.1 $M_\odot$. This system IMF is well described by a two-segment
power-law with $\Gamma=-0.74\pm0.04$ for $m<0.4\ M_\odot$ and $\Gamma=1.50\pm0.11$ for $m\ge0.4\
M_\odot$. It is also well described over the whole mass range by a tapered power-law function with
$\Gamma=1.10\pm0.09$, $m_p=0.31\pm0.03$ and $\beta=2.11\pm0.09$. The best lognormal representation
of the system IMF has $m_c=0.31\pm0.04$ and $\sigma=0.46\pm0.05$ for $m<1\ M_\odot$. This system
IMF does not present significant variations with the radii. We compared the resultant system IMF
as well as the BD/star ratio of $0.16\pm0.03$ we estimated for 25 Ori with that of other stellar regions
with diverse conditions and found no significant discrepancies. These results support the idea
that general star formation mechanisms are probably not strongly dependent to environmental conditions.
We found that the substellar and stellar objects in 25 Ori have similar spatial distributions and
confirmed that 25 Ori is a gravitationally unbound stellar association.
