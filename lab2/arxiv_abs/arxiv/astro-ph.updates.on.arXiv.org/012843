Nucleosynthetic isotopic anomalies in meteorites and planetary objects contribute to our understanding
of the formation of the solar system. Isotope systematics of chondrites demonstrate the existence
of a physical separation between isotopic reservoirs in the solar system. The isotopic composition
of atmospheric xenon (Xe) indicates that its progenitor, U-Xe, is depleted in 134Xe and 136Xe isotopes
relative to Solar or Chondritic end-members. This deficit supports the view that nucleosynthetic
heterogeneities persisted during the Solar System formation. Measurements of xenon emitted from
comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) identified a similar, but more extreme, deficit of cometary
gas in these isotopes relative to Solar gas. Here we show that the data from 67P demonstrate that two
distinct sources contributed xenon isotopes associated with the r-process to the solar system.
The h-process contributed at least 29% (2sigmas) of solar system 136Xe. Mixtures of these r-process
components and the s-process that match the heavy isotope signature of cometary Xe lead to depletions
of the precursor of atmospheric Xe in p-only isotopes. Only the addition of pure p-process Xe to the
isotopic mixture brings 124Xe/132Xe and 126Xe/132Xe ratios back to solar-like values. No pure
p-process Xe has been detected in solar system material, and variation in p-process Xe isotopes
is always correlated with variation in r-process Xe isotopes. In the solar system, p-process incorporation
from the interstellar medium happened before incorporation of r-process nuclides or material
in the outer edge of the solar system carries a different mixture of presolar sources as have been
preserved in parent bodies.
