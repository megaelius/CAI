The determination of the distance to dark star-forming clouds is a key parameter to derive the properties
of the cloud itself, and of its stellar content. This parameter is still loosely constrained even
in nearby star-forming regions. We want to determine the distances to the clouds in the Chamaeleon-Musca
complex and to explore the connection between these clouds and the large scale cloud structures
in the galaxy. We use the newly estimated distances obtained from the parallaxes measured by the
Gaia satellite and included in the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution catalog. When known members
of a region are included in this catalog we use their parallaxes to infer the distance to the cloud.
Otherwise, we analyze the dependence of the color excess on the distance of the stars and look for
a turn-on of this excess, which is a proxy of the position of the front-edge of the star-forming cloud.
We are able to measure the distance to the three Chamaeleon clouds. The distance to Chamaeleon I is
179 pc, 20 pc further away than previously assumed. The Chamaeleon II cloud is located at the distance
of 181 pc, which agrees with previous estimates. We are able to measure for the first time a distance
to the Chamaeleon III cloud of 199 pc. Finally, the distance of the Musca cloud is smaller than 603
pc. These estimates do not allow us to distinguish between the possibility that the Chamaeleon clouds
are part of a sheet of clouds parallel to the galactic plane, or perpendicular to it. Gaia Data Release
2 will allow us to put more stringent constraints on the distances to these clouds by giving us access
to parallax measurements for a larger number of members of these regions.
