We observed star-forming galaxies at z~1.5 selected from the HyperSuprimeCam Subaru Strategic
Program. The galaxies are part of two significant overdensities of [OII] emitters identified via
narrow-band imaging and photometric redshifts from grizy photometry. We used VLT/KMOS to carry
out Halpha integral field spectroscopy of 46 galaxies in total. Ionized gas maps, star formation
rates and velocity fields were derived from the Halpha emission line. We quantified morphological
and kinematical asymmetries to test for potential gravitational (e.g. galaxy-galaxy) or hydrodynamical
(e.g. ram-pressure) interactions. Halpha emission was detected in 36 targets. 34 of the galaxies
are members of two clusters at z=1.47, confirming our selection strategy to be highly efficient.
Two galaxies are field objects at slightly lower redshifts. By fitting model velocity fields to
the observed ones, we determined the intrinsic maximum rotation velocity Vmax of 14 galaxies. Utilizing
the luminosity-velocity (Tully-Fisher) relation, we find that these galaxies are more luminous
than their local counterparts of similar mass by up to several magnitudes in the rest-frame B-band.
In contrast to field galaxies at z<1, the offsets of the z~1.5 cluster galaxies from the local Tully-Fisher
relation are not correlated with their star formation rates but with the ratio between Vmax and gas
velocity dispersion sigma_g. This probably reflects that, as is observed in the field at similar
redshifts, fewer disks have settled to purely rotational kinematics and high Vmax/sigma_g ratios.
The distributions in morphological and kinematical asymmetries hint that either the two clusters
under scrutiny do not have a dense intra-cluster medium yet, or galaxy-galaxy interactions are
frequent, making it difficult to identify cases of purely hydrodynamical interactions between
the intra-cluster and interstellar medium. (abbr.)
