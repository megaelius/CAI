Recently, a fast radio burst (FRB)-like event is found to be associated with a Galactic magnetar,
SGR 1935+2154, accompanied by an X-ray burst. We find this radio burst challenges the typical emission
mechanisms involving magnetars, which includes coherent curvature radiation from charged bunches,
fast magnetosonic (FMS) wave, synchrotron maser from shocks, and the pulsar-like mechanism for
low-twist magnetars. More specifically, we find that (1) the X-rays are most-likely to be produced
inside the magnetosphere. (2) For the coherent curvature radiation from the decay of Alfv\'en wave,
it will generally predict a duration ($\lesssim0.1$ ms) smaller than observations, because of
the strong twists of magnetic field lines and the internal damping of Alfv\'en waves. (3) The FMS
wave model predicts a very low emission frequency $\nu_{\rm p}\sim0.03$ MHz $\ll$ GHz, unless it
is produced inside the magnetosphere. But the absorption effect of the magnetospheric FMS wave
model remains to be studied. (4) The synchrotron maser model is challenged, because observations
show that the peaks in both X-ray and radio light curves are with the same temporal separation $\Delta
t_{\rm FRB}=\Delta t_\gamma\approx0.03$ s, while it would predict $\Delta t_{\rm FRB}\ll\Delta
t_\gamma$. (5) It seems to be difficult to directly apply the low-twist pulsar-like mechanism to
flaring magnetars, as magnetar activity can significantly deform the magnetosphere. (6) We suggested
four possibilities to study the general properties of FRBs for future observations, especially
the possibility of identifying quasi-periodic oscillations with period $\sim1-10$ ms in double/multiple-peaked
FRBs.
