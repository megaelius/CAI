We study the three dimensional arrangement of young stars in the solar neighbourhood using the second
release of the Gaia mission (Gaia DR2) and we provide a new, original view of the spatial configuration
of the star forming regions within 500 pc from the Sun. By smoothing the star distribution through
a gaussian filter, we construct three dimensional density maps for early-type stars (upper-main
sequence, UMS) and pre-main sequence (PMS) sources. The PMS and the UMS samples are selected through
a combination of photometric and astrometric criteria. A side product of the analysis is a three
dimensional, G-band extinction map, which we use to correct our colour-magnitude diagram for extinction
and reddening. Both density maps show three prominent structures, Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion,
and Vela. The PMS map shows a plethora of lower mass star forming regions, such as Taurus, Perseus,
Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta, which are less visible in the UMS map, due to the lack of large numbers
of bright, early-type stars. We report the finding of a candidate new open cluster towards $l, b \sim
218.5^{\circ}, -2^{\circ}$, which could be related to the Orion star forming complex. We estimate
ages for the PMS sample and we study the distribution of PMS stars as a function of their age. We find
that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by older sources, whose
distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus,
Orion, Vela, and Taurus. Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous.
Finally, we find that the three dimensional density maps show no evidence for the existence of the
ring-like structure which is usually referred to as the Gould Belt.
