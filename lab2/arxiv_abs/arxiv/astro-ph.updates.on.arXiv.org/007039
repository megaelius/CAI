Asteroseismology provides global stellar parameters such as masses, radii or surface gravities
using the mean global seismic parameters as well as the effective temperature for thousands of low-mass
stars $(0.8 M_\odot <M<3 M_\odot)$. This methodology has been successfully applied to stars in
which acoustic modes excited by turbulent convection are measured. Other techniques such as the
Flicker can also be used to determine stellar surface gravities, but only works for $\log{g}$ above
$2.5$ dex. In this work, we present a new metric called FliPer (the acronym stands for Flicker in spectral
power density, in opposition to the standard Flicker measurement which is computed in the time domain
that is able to extend the range for which reliable surface gravities can be obtained ($0.1<\log{g}<4.6$
dex) without performing any seismic analysis for stars brighter than $\textit{Kp}$ $<$ 14. FliPer
takes into account the average variability of a star measured in the power density spectrum in a given
range of frequencies. However, FliPer values calculated on several ranges of frequency are required
to better characterize a star. Using a large set of asteroseismic targets it is possible to calibrate
the behavior of surface gravity with FliPer through machine learning. This calibration made with
a random forest regressor covers a wide range of surface gravities from main-sequence stars to subgiants
and red giants, with very small uncertainties from $0.04$ to $0.1$ dex. FliPer values can be inserted
in automatic global seismic pipelines to either give an estimation of the stellar surface gravity
or to assess the quality of the seismic results by detecting any outliers in the obtained $\nu_{max}$
values. FliPer also constrain the surface gravities of main-sequence dwarfs using only long cadence
data for which the Nyquist frequency is too low to measure the acoustic-mode properties.
