Recently, a new cylindrical-shaped stream of stars, up to 700 pc long, was discovered hiding in the
Galactic disk using kinematic data enabled by the Gaia mission. This curious stream of stars, dubbed
the Pisces-Eridanus stream, was initially thought to be as old as 1 Gyr, yet its stars shared a rotation
period distribution consistent with the 120-Myr-old Pleiades cluster. In this work, we explore
the detailed chemical nature of this stellar stream. We carried out high-resolution spectroscopic
follow-up of 42 Pisces-Eridanus stream stars using McDonald Observatory, and combined these data
with information for 40 members observed with the low-resolution LAMOST spectroscopic survey.
Together, these data enabled us to measure the abundance distribution of light/odd-Z (Li, C, Na,
Al, Sc, V), $\alpha$ (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), Fe-peak (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn), and neutron capture (Sr, Y,
Zr, Ba, La, Nd, Eu) elements across the Pisces-Eridanus stream. We find that the stream is (1) near
solar metallicity with [Fe/H] = -0.03 dex and (2) has a metallicity spread of 0.07 dex (or 0.04 dex
when removing outliers). We also find that (3) the abundance of Li indicates that Pisces-Eridanus
is $\sim$120 Myr old, consistent with the gyrochronology result. We find that (4) the stream has
a [X/Fe] abundance spreads of 0.06 $< \sigma$[X/Fe] $< $ 0.20 dex in most elements, and (5) no significant
abundance gradients across its major axis except a potentially weak gradient in [Si/Fe]. These
results together show that the Pisces-Eridanus stream is a uniquely close, young, chemically interesting
laboratory for testing our understanding of star and planet formation.
