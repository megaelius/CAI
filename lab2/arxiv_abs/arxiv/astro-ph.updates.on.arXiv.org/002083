We present a study of the very high energy (VHE; E > 100 GeV) gamma-ray emission of the blazar PKS
1424+240 observed with the MAGIC telescopes. The primary aim of this paper is the multiwavelength
spectral characterization and modeling of this blazar, which is made particularly interesting
by the recent discovery of a lower limit of its redshift of z > 0.6 and makes it a promising candidate
to be the most distant VHE source. The source has been observed with the MAGIC telescopes in VHE gamma
rays for a total observation time of ~33.6 h from 2009 to 2011. The source was marginally detected
in VHE gamma rays during 2009 and 2010, and later, the detection was confirmed during an optical outburst
in 2011. The combined significance of the stacked sample is ~7.2 sigma. The differential spectra
measured during the different campaigns can be described by steep power laws with the indices ranging
from 3.5 +/- 1.2 to 5.0 +/- 1.7. The MAGIC spectra corrected for the absorption due to the extragalactic
background light connect smoothly, within systematic errors, with the mean spectrum in 2009-2011
observed at lower energies by the Fermi-LAT. The absorption-corrected MAGIC spectrum is flat with
no apparent turn down up to 400 GeV. The multiwavelength light curve shows increasing flux in radio
and optical bands that could point to a common origin from the same region of the jet. The large separation
between the two peaks of the constructed non-simultaneous spectral energy distribution also requires
an extremely high Doppler factor if an one zone synchrotron self-Compton model is applied. We find
that a two-component synchrotron self-Compton model describes the spectral energy distribution
of the source well, if the source is located at z~0.6.
