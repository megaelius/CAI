A present prevailing open problem planetary nebulae research, and photoionized gaseous nebulae
research at large, is the systematic discrepancies in ionic abundances derived from recombination
and collisionally excited lines in many H II regions and planetary nebulae. Peimbert (1967) proposed
that these discrepancies were due to 'temperature fluctuations' in the plasma, but the amplitude
of such fluctuations remain unexplained by standard phtoionization modeling. In this letter we
show that large amplitude temperature oscillations are expected to form in gaseous nebulae photoionized
by short-period binary stars. Such stars yield periodically varying ionizing radiation fields,
which induce periodic oscilla- tions in the heating-minus-cooling function across the nebula.
For flux oscillation periods of a few days any temperature perturbations in the gas with frequencies
similar to those of the ionizing source will undergo resonant amplification. In this case, the rate
of growth of the perturbations increases with the amplitude of the variations of the ionizing flux
and with decreasing nebular equilibrium temperature. We also present a line ratios diagnostic
plot that combines [O III] collisional lines and O II recombination lines for diagnosing equilibrium
and fluctuation am- plitude temperatures in gaseous nebulae. When applying this diagnostic to
the planetary nebula M 1-42 we find an equilibrium temperature of ~6000 K and a resonant temperature
fluctuation amplitude (Trtf ) of ~4000 K. This equilibrium temperature is significantly lower
than the temperature estimated when temperature perturbations are ignored.
