Gaseous halos play a key role for understanding inflow, feedback and the overall baryon budget in
galaxies. Literature models predict transitions of the state of the gaseous halo between cold and
hot accretion, winds, fountains and hydrostatic halos at certain galaxy masses. Since luminosities
of radio AGN are sensitive to halo densities, any significant transition would be expected to show
up in the radio luminosities of large samples of galaxies. The Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) Two Metre
Sky Survey (LoTSS) has indeed identified a galaxy stellar mass scale, $10^{11} M_\odot$ , above
which the radio luminosities increase disproportionately. Here, we investigate, if radio luminosities
of galaxies, especially the marked rise at galaxy masses around $10^{11} M_\odot$, can be explained
with standard assumptions on jet powers, scaling between black hole-mass and galaxy mass and gaseous
halos. We developed models for the radio luminosity of radio AGN in halos under infall, galactic
wind and hydrostatic conditions based on observational data and theoretical constraints, and
compared it to LoTSS data for a large sample of galaxies in the mass rangebetween $10^{8.5} M_\odot$
and $10^{12} M_\odot$. Assuming the same characteristic upper limit to jet powers as is known from
high galaxy masses to hold at all masses, we find that the maximum radio luminosities for the hydrostatic
gas halos fit well with the upper envelope of the distribution of the LOFAR data. The marked rise in
radio luminosity at $10^{11} M_\odot$ is matched in our model, and is related to significant change
in halo gas density around this galaxy mass, which is a consequence of the lower cooling rates at higher
virial temperature. Wind and infall models overpredict the radio luminosities at small galaxy
masses and have no particular steepening of the run of the radio luminosities predicted at any galaxy
mass. [...]
