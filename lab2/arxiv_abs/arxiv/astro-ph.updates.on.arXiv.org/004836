The evolution of stars born with a convective core is highly dependent on the efficiency and extent
of near core mixing processes, which effectively increases both the core mass and main-sequence
lifetime. We investigate to what extent gravity-mode period spacings in slowly pulsating B-type
stars observed by the Kepler mission can be used to constrain both the shape and extent of convective
core overshoot and additional mixing in the radiative envelope. We compute grids of 1D stellar structure
and evolution models for two different shapes of convective core overshooting and three shapes
of radiative envelope mixing. The models in these grids are compared to a set of benchmark models
to evaluate their capability of mimicking the dipole prograde g-modes of the benchmark models.
Through our model comparisons we find that at a central hydrogen content of Xc = 0.5, dipole prograde
g-modes in the period range 0.8-3 d are capable of differentiating between step and exponential
diffusive overshooting. This ability disappears towards the terminal age main-sequence at Xc
= 0.1. Furthermore, the g-modes behave the same for the three different shapes of radiative envelope
mixing considered. However, a constant envelope mixing requires a diffusion coefficient near
the convective core five times higher than chemical mixing from internal gravity waves to obtain
a surface nitrogen excess of about 0.5 dex within the main-sequence lifetime. Within estimated
frequency errors of the Kepler mission, the ability of g-modes to distinguish between step and exponential
diffusive overshooting depends on the evolutionary stage. Combining information from the average
period spacing and observed surface abundances, notably nitrogen, could potentially be used to
constrain the shape of mixing in the radiative envelope of massive stars.
