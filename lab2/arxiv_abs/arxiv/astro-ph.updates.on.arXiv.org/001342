Context. M subdwarfs are metal poor and cool stars. They are important probes of the old galactic
populations. However, they remain elusive due to their low luminosity. Observational and modeling
efforts are required to fully understand their physics and to investigate the effects of metallicity
in their cool atmospheres. Aims. We perform a detailed study of a sample of subdwarfs to determine
their stellar parameters and constrain the stat-of-the art atmospheric models. Methods. We present
UVES/VLT high resolution spectra of three late-K subdwarfs and 18 M subdwarfs. Our atlas covers
the optical region from 6400 AA up to the near infrared at 8900 AA. We show spectral details of cool
atmospheres at very high resolution (R= 40 000) and compare with synthetic spectra computed from
the recent BT-Settl atmosphere models. Results. Our comparison shows that molecular features
(TiO, VO, CaH), and atomic features (Fe I, Ti I, Na I, K I) are well fitted by current models. We produce
an effective temperature versus spectral type relation all over the subdwarf spectral sequence.
Thanks to the high resolution of our spectra, we perform a detailed comparison of line profiles of
individual elements such as Fe I, Ca II, Ti I, and are able to determine accurate metallicities of
these stars. These determinations contribute to calibrate the relation between metallicity and
molecular band strength indices from low-resolution spectra. Conclusions. This work shows that
the new generation of models are able to reproduce various spectral features of M subdwarfs. Working
with these high resolution spectra allowed us to disentangle the atmospheric parameters (effective
temperature, gravity, metallicity), which is not possible when using low resolution spectroscopy
or photometry.
