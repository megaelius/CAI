Water is usually the main component of ice mantles, which cover the cores of dust grains in cold portions
of dense interstellar clouds. When molecular hydrogen is adsorbed onto an icy mantle through physisorption,
a common assumption in gas-grain rate equation models is to use an adsorption energy for molecular
hydrogen on a pure water substrate. However, at high density and low temperature, when H2 is efficiently
adsorbed onto the mantle, its surface abundance can be strongly overestimated if this assumption
is still used. Unfortunately, the more detailed microscopic Monte Carlo treatment cannot be used
to study the abundance of H2 in ice mantles if a full gas-grain network is utilized. We present a numerical
method adapted for rate-equation models that takes into account the possibility that an H2 molecule
can, while diffusing on the surface, find itself bound to another hydrogen molecule, with a far weaker
bond than the H2-water bond, which can lead to more efficient desorption. We label the ensuing desorption
"encounter desorption". The method is implemented first in a simple system consisting only of hydrogen
molecules at steady state between gas and dust using the rate-equation approach and comparing the
results with the results of a microscopic Monte Carlo calculation. We then discuss the use of the
rate-equation approach with encounter desorption embedded in a complete gas-grain chemical network.
For both systems, the rate-equation model with encounter desorption reproduces the H2 granular
coverage computed by the microscopic Monte Carlo model. The method is especially useful for dense
and cold environments, and for time-dependent physical conditions, such as occur in the collapse
of dense cores and the formation of protoplanetary disks. It is not significantly CPU time consuming,
so can be used for example with complex 3D chemical-hydrodynamical simulations.
