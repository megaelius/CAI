Almost all the planets of our solar system have moons. Each planetary system has however unique characteristics.
The Martian system has not one single big moon like the Earth, not tens of moons of various sizes like
for the giant planets, but two small moons: Phobos and Deimos. How did form such a system? This question
is still being investigated on the basis of the Earth-based and space-borne observations of the
Martian moons and of the more modern theories proposed to account for the formation of other moon
systems. The most recent scenario of formation of the Martian moons relies on a giant impact occurring
at early Mars history and having also formed the so-called hemispheric crustal dichotomy. This
scenario accounts for the current orbits of both moons unlike the scenario of capture of small size
asteroids. It also predicts a composition of disk material as a mixture of Mars and impactor materials
that is in agreement with remote sensing observations of both moon surfaces, which suggests a composition
different from Mars. The composition of the Martian moons is however unclear, given the ambiguity
on the interpretation of the remote sensing observations. The study of the formation of the Martian
moon system has improved our understanding of moon formation of terrestrial planets: The giant
collision scenario can have various outcomes and not only a big moon as for the Earth. This scenario
finds a natural place in our current vision of the early solar system when conditions were favorable
for giant collisions to occur. The next step in exploration of Martian moon is a sample return mission
to test the giant collision scenario for their origin, and to provide tests of models of early solar
system dynamics since Mars may retain material exchanged between the inner and outer solar system.
