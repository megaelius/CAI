Post-starburst galaxies can be identified via the presence of prominent Hydrogen Balmer absorption
lines in their spectra. We present a comprehensive study of the origin of strong Balmer lines in a
volume-limited sample of 189 galaxies with $0.01<z<0.05$, $\log(\mbox{M}_{\star}/\mbox{M}_{\odot})>9.5$
and projected axis ratio $b/a>0.32$. We explore their structural properties, environments, emission
lines and star formation histories, and compare them to control samples of star-forming and quiescent
galaxies, and simulated galaxy mergers. Excluding contaminants, in which the strong Balmer lines
are most likely caused by dust-star geometry, we find evidence for three different pathways through
the post-starburst phase, with most events occurring in intermediate-density environments:
(1) a significant disruptive event, such as a gas-rich major merger, causing a starburst and growth
of a spheroidal component, followed by quenching of the star formation (70% of post-starburst galaxies
at $9.5<\log(\mbox{M}_{\star}/\mbox{M}_{\odot})<10.5$ and 60% at $\log(\mbox{M}_{\star}/\mbox{M}_{\odot})>10.5$);
(2) at $9.5<\log(\mbox{M}_{\star}/\mbox{M}_{\odot})<10.5$, stochastic star formation in
blue-sequence galaxies, causing a weak burst and subsequent return to the blue sequence (30%);
(3) at $\log(\mbox{M}_{\star}/\mbox{M}_{\odot})>10.5$, cyclic evolution of quiescent galaxies
which gradually move towards the high-mass end of the red sequence through weak starbursts, possibly
as a result of a merger with a smaller gas-rich companion (40%). Our analysis suggests that AGN are
`on' for $50%$ of the duration of the post-starburst phase, meaning that traditional samples of
post-starburst galaxies with strict emission line cuts will be at least $50%$ incomplete due to
the exclusion of narrow-line AGN.
