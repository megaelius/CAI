The ubiquitous presence of filamentary structures in the interstellar medium asks for an unbiased
characterization of their properties including a stability analysis. We propose a novel technique
to measure the spectrum of filaments in any two-dimensional data set. Using anisotropic wavelets
we can quantify and distinguish local and global anisotropies and measure the size distribution
of filaments. The wavelet analysis does not need any assumptions on the alignment or shape of filaments
in the maps, but directly measures their typical spatial dimensions. In a rigorous test program,
we calibrate the scale-dependence of the method and test the angular and spatial sensitivity. We
apply the method to molecular line maps from magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and observed
column density maps from Herschel observations. When applying the anisotropic wavelet analysis
to the MHD data, we find that the observed filament sizes depend on the combination of magnetic-field
dominated density-velocity correlations with radiative transfer effects. This can be exploited
by observing tracers with different optical depth to measure the transition from a globally ordered
large-scale structure to small-scale filaments with entangled field lines. The unbiased view
to Herschel column density maps does not confirm a universal characteristic filament width. The
map of the Polaris Flare shows an almost scale-free filamentary spectrum up to the size of the dominating
filament of about 0.4pc. For the Aquila molecular cloud the range of filament widths is limited to
0.05-0.2pc. The filaments in Polaris show no preferential direction in contrast to the global alignment
that we trace in Aquila. By comparing the power in isotropic and anisotropic structures we can measure
the relative importance of spherical and cylindrical collapse modes and their spatial distribution.
