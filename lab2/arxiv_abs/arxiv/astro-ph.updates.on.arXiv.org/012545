Tidally locked gas giants are typically in several-day orbits, implying a modest role for rotation
in the atmospheric circulation. Nevertheless, there exist a class of gas-giant, highly irradiated
objects---brown dwarfs orbiting white dwarfs in extremely tight orbits---whose orbital and hence
rotation periods are as short as 1-2 hours. Phase curves and other observations have already been
obtained for this class of objects, raising fundamental questions about the role of increasing
planetary rotation rate in controlling the circulation. So far, most modeling studies have investigated
rotation periods exceeding a day, as appropriate for typical hot Jupiters. Here we investigate
atmospheric circulation of tidally locked atmospheres with decreasing rotation periods down
to 2.5 hours. With decreasing rotation period, the width of the equatorial eastward jet decreases,
consistent with the narrowing of the equatorial waveguide due to a decrease of the equatorial deformation
radius. The eastward-shifted equatorial hot spot offset decreases accordingly, and the off-equatorial
westward-shifted hot areas become increasingly distinctive. At high latitudes, winds become
weaker and more rotationally dominated. The day-night temperature contrast becomes larger due
to the stronger influence of rotation. Our simulated atmospheres exhibit variability, presumably
caused by instabilities and wave interactions. Unlike typical hot Jupiter models, thermal phase
curves of rapidly rotating models show a near alignment of peak flux to secondary eclipse. This result
helps to explain why, unlike hot Jupiters, many brown dwarfs orbiting white dwarfs exhibit IR flux
peaks aligned with secondary eclipse. Our results have important implications for understanding
fast-rotating, tidally locked atmospheres.
