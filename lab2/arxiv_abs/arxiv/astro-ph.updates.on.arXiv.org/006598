Theoretical uncertainties on non-linear scales are among the main obstacles to exploit the sensitivity
of forthcoming galaxy and hydrogen surveys like Euclid or the SKA. Here, we devise a new method to
model the theoretical error that goes beyond the usual cut-off on small scales. The advantage of
this more efficient implementation of the non-linear uncertainties is tested through a MCMC forecast
of the sensitivity of Euclid and SKA to the parameters of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, including
massive neutrinos with total mass $M_\nu$, and to 3 extended scenarios, including 1) additional
relativistic degrees of freedom ($\Lambda$CDM + $M_\nu$ + $N_\mathrm{eff}$), 2) a deviation from
the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$CDM + $M_\nu$ + $w_0$), and 3) a time-varying dark energy equation
of state parameter ($\Lambda$CDM + $M_\nu$ + $\left(w_0,w_a \right)$). We compare the sensitivity
of 14 different combinations of cosmological probes and experimental configurations. For Euclid
combined with Planck, assuming a plain cosmological constant, our method gives robust predictions
for a high sensitivity to the primordial spectral index $n_{\rm s}$ ($\sigma(n_s)=0.00056$),
the Hubble constant $H_0$ ($\sigma(H_0)=0.078 \, {\rm km/s/Mpc}$), the total neutrino mass $M_\nu$
($\sigma(M_\nu)=0.014 \, {\rm eV}$). Assuming dynamical dark energy we get $\sigma(M_\nu)=0.024
\, {\rm eV}$ for the mass and $(\sigma(w_0), \sigma(w_a)) = (0.0098, 0.033)$ for the equation of
state parameters. The predicted sensitivity to $M_\nu$ is mostly stable against the extensions
of the cosmological model considered here. Interestingly, a significant improvement of the constraints
on the extended model parameters is also obtained when combining Euclid with a low redshift HI intensity
mapping survey by SKA1, demonstrating the synergy of Euclid and SKA.
