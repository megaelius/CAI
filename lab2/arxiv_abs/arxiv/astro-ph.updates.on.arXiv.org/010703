The problem of estimating a one-dimensional signal possessing mixed degrees of smoothness is ubiquitous
in time-domain astronomy and astronomical spectroscopy. For example, in the time domain, an astronomical
object may exhibit a smoothly varying intensity that is occasionally interrupted by abrupt dips
or spikes. Likewise, in the spectroscopic setting, a noiseless spectrum typically contains intervals
of relative smoothness mixed with localized higher frequency components such as emission peaks
and absorption lines. In this work, we present $L_1$ trend filtering (Steidl et al.; Kim et al.),
a modern nonparametric statistical tool that yields significant improvements in this broad problem
space of estimating spatially heterogeneous signals. When the underlying signal is spatially
heterogeneous, the $L_1$ trend filter has been shown to be strictly superior to any estimator that
is a linear combination of the observed data, including smoothing splines, kernels, and Gaussian
processes. Moreover, the $L_1$ trend filter does not require the restrictive setup of wavelets
--- the definitive classical approach for modeling spatially heterogeneous signals. In the spirit
of illustrating the wide applicability of $L_1$ trend filtering, we briefly demonstrate its utility
on several relevant astrophysical data sets: two Kepler light curves (an exoplanet transit and
an eclipsing binary system), a Palomar Transient Factory supernova light curve, and an SDSS galaxy
spectrum. Furthermore, we present a more rigorous analysis of the Lyman-alpha forest of SDSS quasar
spectra --- a standard cosmological tool for probing the large-scale structure of the high redshift
intergalactic medium.
