We discuss the results of the analysis of multi-wavelength data for the afterglows of GRB 081007
and GRB 090424, two bursts detected by Swift. One of them, GRB 081007, also shows a spectroscopically
confirmed supernova, SN 2008hw, which resembles SN 1998bw in its absorption features, while the
maximum luminosity is only about half as large as that of SN 1998bw. Bright optical flashes have been
detected in both events, which allows us to derive solid constraints on the circumburst-matter
density profile. This is particularly interesting in the case of GRB 081007, whose afterglow is
found to be propagating into a constant-density medium, yielding yet another example of a GRB clearly
associated with a massive star progenitor which did not sculpt the surroundings with its stellar
wind. There is no supernova component detected in the afterglow of GRB 090424, likely due to the brightness
of the host galaxy, comparable to the Milky Way. We show that the afterglow data are consistent with
the presence of both forward- and reverse-shock emission powered by relativistic outflows expanding
into the interstellar medium. The absence of optical peaks due to the forward shock strongly suggests
that the reverse shock regions should be mildly magnetized. The initial Lorentz factor of outflow
of GRB 081007 is estimated to be \Gamma ~ 200, while for GRB 090424 a lower limit of \Gamma > 170 is
derived. We also discuss the prompt emission of GRB 081007, which consists of just a single pulse.
We argue that neither the external forward-shock model nor the shock-breakout model can account
for the prompt emission data and suggest that the single-pulse-like prompt emission may be due to
magnetic energy dissipation of a Poynting-flux dominated outflow or to a dissipative photosphere.
