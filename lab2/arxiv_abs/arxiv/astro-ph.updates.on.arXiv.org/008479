Star formation in galaxies is inefficient, and understanding how star formation is regulated in
galaxies is one of the most fundamental challenges of contemporary astrophysics. Radiative cooling,
feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei, large-scale dynamics and dissipation of
turbulent energy act over various time and spatial scales, and all regulate star formation in a complex
gas cycle. This paper presents the physics implemented in a new semi-analytical model of galaxy
formation and evolution: G.A.S.. The fundamental underpinning of our new model is the development
of a multi-phase interstellar medium in which energy produced by supernovae and active galactic
nuclei maintains an equilibrium between the diffuse, hot, stable gas and a cooler, clumpy, low-volume
filling factor gas. The hot gas is susceptible to thermal and dynamical instabilities. We include
a description of how turbulence leads to the formation of giant molecular clouds through an inertial
turbulent energy cascade. We explicitly model the evolution of the velocity dispersion at different
scales of the cascade and account for thermal instabilities in the hot halo gas. We show that rapid
and multiple exchanges between diffuse and unstable gas phases strongly regulates star-formation
rates in galaxies because only a small fraction of the unstable gas is forming stars. For high mass
halos, cooling is naturally regulated by the growth of thermal instabilities, so we do not need to
implement strong AGN feedback. The characteristic timescales describing the gas cycle are in good
agreement with observations. Results are in good agreement with the observed stellar mass function
from z=6.0 to z=0.5. Thermal instabilities and the cascade of turbulent energy in the dense gas phase
introduce a delay between gas accretion and star formation, which keeps galaxy growth inefficient
in the early Universe.
