We present results of 2D axisymmetric core-collapse supernova simulations, employing the FORNAX
code, of nine progenitor models spanning 12 to 25 M$_{\odot}$ and evolved over a 20,000-km grid.
We find that four of the nine models explode with inelastic scattering off electrons and neutrons
as well as the many-body correction to neutrino-nucleon scattering opacities. We show that these
four models feature sharp Si-O interfaces in their density profiles, and that the corresponding
dip in density reduces the accretion rate around the stalled shock and prompts explosion. The non-exploding
models lack such a steep feature, suggesting that Si-O interface is one key to explosion. Furthermore,
we show that all of the non-exploding models can be nudged to explosion with modest changes to macrophysical
inputs, including moderate rotation and perturbations to infall velocities, as well as to microphysical
inputs, including changes to neutrino-nucleon interaction rates, suggesting that all the models
are perhaps close to criticality. Exploding models have energies of few $\times$10$^{50}$ ergs
at the end of our simulation, and are rising, suggesting the need to continue these simulations over
larger grids and for longer times to reproduce the energies seen in Nature. We find that the morphology
of the explosion contributes to the explosion energy, with more isotropic ejecta producing larger
explosion energies. However, we do not find evidence for the Lepton-number Emission Self-Sustained
Asymmetry. Finally, we look at PNS properties and explore the role of dimension in our simulations.
We find that convection in the proto-neutron star (PNS) produces larger PNS radii as well as greater
"$\nu_\mu$" luminosities in 2D compared to 1D.
