Cosmological observational analysis frequently assumes that the Universe is spatially flat.
We aim to non-perturbatively check the conditions under which a flat or nearly flat expanding dust
universe, including the LCDM model if interpreted as strictly flat, forbids the gravitational
collapse of structure. We quantify spatial curvature at turnaround. We use the Hamiltonian constraint
to determine the pointwise conditions required for an overdensity to reach its turnaround epoch
in an exactly flat spatial domain. We illustrate this with a plane-symmetric, exact, cosmological
solution of the Einstein equation, extending earlier work. More generally, for a standard initial
power spectrum, we use the relativistic Zel'dovich approximation implemented in 'inhomog' to
numerically estimate how much positive spatial curvature is required for turnaround to be allowed
at typical epochs/length scales in almost-EdS and almost-LCDM models with inhomogeneous curvature.
We find that gravitational collapse in a spatially exactly flat, irrotational, expanding, dust
universe is relativistically forbidden pointwise. In the spatially flat plane-symmetric model
considered here, pancake collapse is excluded both pointwise and in averaged domains. In an almost-EdS
or LCDM model, the per-domain average curvature in collapsing domains almost always becomes strongly
positive prior to turnaround, with the expansion-normalised curvature functional reaching $\Omega_{\cal
R}^{\cal D} \sim -5$. We show analytically that a special case gives $\Omega_{\cal R}^{\cal D} =
-5$ exactly (if normalised using the EdS expansion rate) at turnaround. An interpretation of LCDM
as literally 3-Ricci flat would forbid structure formation. The difference between relativistic
cosmology and a strictly flat LCDM model is fundamental in principle, but we find that the geometrical
effect is weak.
