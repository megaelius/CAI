By using a suite of large box-size N-body simulations that incorporate massive neutrinos as an extra
set of particles, we investigate the impact of neutrino masses on the spatial distribution of dark
matter haloes and galaxies. We compute the bias between the spatial distribution of dark matter
haloes and the overall matter and cold dark matter distributions using statistical tools such as
the power spectrum and the two-point correlation function. Overall we find a scale-dependent bias
on large scales for the cosmologies with massive neutrinos. However, our results indicate that
the scale-dependence in the bias is reduced if the latter is computed with respect to the cold dark
matter distribution only. We find that the value of the bias on large scales is reasonably well reproduced
by the Tinker fitting formula once the linear cold dark matter power spectrum is used, instead of
the total matter power spectrum. We investigate whether scale-dependent bias really comes from
purely neutrino's effect or from nonlinear gravitational collapse of haloes. For this purpose,
we address the $\Omega_\nu$-$\sigma_8$ degeneracy and find that such degeneracy is not perfect,
implying that neutrinos imprint a slight scale dependence on the large-scale bias. Finally, by
using a simple halo occupation distribution (HOD) model, we investigate the impact of massive neutrinos
on the distribution of galaxies within dark matter haloes. We use the main galaxy sample in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey II Data Release 7 to investigate if the small-scale galaxy clustering alone can
be used to discriminate among different cosmological models with different neutrino masses. Our
results suggest that different choices of the HOD parameters can reproduce the observational measurements
relatively well, and we quantify the difference between the values of the HOD parameters between
massless and massive neutrino cosmologies.
