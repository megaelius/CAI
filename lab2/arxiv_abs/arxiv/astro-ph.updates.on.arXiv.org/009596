We investigate metal pollution onto the surface of low-mass population III stars (Pop. III survivors)
via interstellar objects floating in the Galactic interstellar medium. Only recently, Tanikawa
et al. analytically estimated how much metal should collide to an orbiting Pop. III survivor encouraged
by the recent discovery of 'Oumuamua and suggested that ISOs are the most dominant contributor of
metal enrichment of Pop. III survivors. When we consider a distribution of interstellar objects
in the Galactic disc, Pop. III survivors' orbits are significant properties to estimate the accretion
rate of them though Tanikawa et al. assumed one modelled orbit. To take more realistic orbits into
calculating the accretion rate, we use a high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulation that
resolves dark matter minihaloes. Pop. III survivors located at solar neighbourhood have a number
of chances of ISO($> 100$ m) collisions, typically $5\times10^6$ times in the last $5$ Gyr, which
is one order of magnitude greater than estimated in the previous study. When we assume a power-law
parameter $\alpha$ of the ISO cumulative number density with size greater than $D$ as $n \propto
D^{-\alpha}$, $0.80 \, M_{\odot}$ stars should be typically polluted [Fe/H]$\sim -2$ for the case
of $\alpha=2.0$. Even in the cases of $0.70$ and $0.75 \, M_{\odot}$ stars, the typical surface metallicity
are around [Fe/H]$=-6 \sim -5$. From the presence of stars with their [Fe/H], we can constrain on
the lower limit of the power $\alpha$, as $\alpha \gtrsim 2.0$, which is consistent with $\alpha$
of km-size asteroids and comets in the solar system. Furthermore, we provide six candidates as the
ISO-polluted Pop. III stars in the case of $\alpha \sim 2.5$. Metal-poor stars so far discovered
are possible to be metal-free Pop. III stars on birth.
