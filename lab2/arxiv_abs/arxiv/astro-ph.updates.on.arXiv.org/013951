We present a study of interstellar comet 2I/2019 Q4 (Borisov) using both preperihelion and postperihelion
observations spanning late September 2019 through late January 2020. The intrinsic brightness
of the comet was observed to continuously decline throughout the timespan, not due to the phase effect
but the decreasing effective scattering cross-section as a result of volatile sublimation with
a slope of $-0.43 \pm 0.02$ km$^{2}$ d$^{-1}$. Given the measurement uncertainties, we witnessed
no change in the slightly reddish colour of the comet, with mean values of $\left \langle g - r \right
\rangle = 0.68 \pm 0.04$, $\left \langle r - i \right \rangle = 0.23 \pm 0.03$, and the normalised reflectivity
gradient across the {\it g} and {\it i} bands $\overline{S'} \left(g,i\right) = \left(10.6 \pm
1.4\right)$ \% per $10^3$ \AA, all unremarkable in the context of solar system comets. Using the
available astrometric observations, we confidently detect the nongravitational acceleration
of the comet following a shallow heliocentric distance dependency of $r_{\rm H}^{-1 \pm 1}$. Accordingly,
we estimate that the nucleus is most likely $\lesssim$0.4 km in radius, and that a fraction of $\gtrsim$0.2\%
of the total nucleus in mass has been eroded due to the sublimation activity since the earliest observation
of the comet in 2018 December by the time of perihelion. Our morphology simulation suggests that
the dust ejection speed increased from $\sim$4 m s$^{-1}$ in September 2019 to $\sim$7 m s$^{-1}$
around perihelion for the optically dominant dust grains of $\beta \sim 0.01$, and that the observable
dust grains are no smaller than micron size.
