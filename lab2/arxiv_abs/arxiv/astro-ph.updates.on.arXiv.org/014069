We used the APEX telescope to observe spectral lines occurring at about 170 GHz frequency towards
14 positions along the full extent of the filamentary Seahorse infrared dark cloud. Six spectral
line transitions were detected ($\geq3\sigma$) altogether, namely, SO$(N_J=4_4-3_3)$, H$^{13}$CN$(J=2-1)$,
H$^{13}$CO$^+(J=2-1)$, SiO$(J=4-3)$, HN$^{13}$C$(J=2-1)$, and C$_2$H$(N=2-1)$. While SO,
H$^{13}$CO$^+$, and HN$^{13}$C were detected in every source, the detection rates for C$_2$H and
H$^{13}$CN were 92.9% and 85.7%, respectively. Only one source (SMM 3) showed detectable SiO emission
(7.1% detection rate). Three clumps (SMM 5, 6, and 7) showed the SO, H$^{13}$CN, H$^{13}$CO$^+$,
HN$^{13}$C, and C$_2$H lines in absorption. We found three positive correlations among the derived
molecular abundances, of which those between C$_2$H and HN$^{13}$C and HN$^{13}$C and H$^{13}$CO$^+$
are the most significant (correlation coefficient $r\simeq0.9$). The statistically most significant
evolutionary trends we uncovered are the drops in the C$_2$H abundance and in the $[{\rm HN^{13}C}]/[{\rm
H^{13}CN}]$ ratio as the clump evolves from an IR dark stage to an IR bright stage and then to an HII
region. The correlations we found between the different molecular abundances can be understood
as arising from the gas-phase electron (ionisation degree) and atomic carbon abundances. The [C$_2$H]
evolutionary indicator we found is in agreement with previous studies, and can be explained by the
conversion of C$_2$H to other species (e.g. CO) when the clump temperature rises, especially after
the ignition of a hot molecular core in the clump. The decrease of $[{\rm HN^{13}C}]/[{\rm H^{13}CN}]$
as the clump evolves is also likely to reflect the increase in the clump temperature, which leads
to an enhanced formation of HCN and its $^{13}$C isotopologue.
