Pulsar wind nebulae are efficient particle accelerators, and yet the processes at work remain elusive.
Self-generated, microturbulence is too weak in relativistic magnetized shocks to accelerate
particles over a wide energy range, suggesting that the global dynamics of the nebula may be involved
in the acceleration process instead. In this work, we study the role played by the large-scale anisotropy
of the transverse magnetic field profile on the shock dynamics. We performed large two-dimensional
particle-in-cell simulations for a wide range of upstream plasma magnetizations. A large-scale
velocity shear and current sheets form in the equatorial regions and at the poles, where they drive
strong plasma turbulence via Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices and kinks. The mixing of current sheets
in the downstream flow leads to efficient nonthermal particle acceleration. The power-law spectrum
hardens with increasing magnetization, akin to those found in relativistic reconnection and kinetic
turbulence studies. The high end of the spectrum is composed of particles surfing on the wake produced
by elongated spearhead-shaped cavities forming at the shock front and piercing through the upstream
flow. These particles are efficiently accelerated via the shear-flow acceleration mechanism
near the Bohm limit. Magnetized relativistic shocks are very efficient particle accelerators.
Capturing the global dynamics of the downstream flow is crucial to understanding them, and therefore
local plane parallel studies may not be appropriate for pulsar wind nebulae and possibly other astrophysical
relativistic magnetized shocks. A natural outcome of such shocks is a variable and Doppler-boosted
synchrotron emission at the high end of the spectrum originating from the shock-front cavities,
reminiscent of the mysterious Crab Nebula gamma-ray flares.
