X-ray signatures of outflowing gas have been detected in several accreting black-hole binaries,
always in the soft state. A key question raised by these observations is whether these winds might
also exist in the hard state. Here, we carry out the first full-frequency radiation hydrodynamic
simulations of luminous ($\rm{L = 0.5 \, L_{\mathrm{Edd}}}$) black-hole X-ray binary systems
in both the hard and the soft state, with realistic spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Our simulations
are designed to describe X-ray transients near the peak of their outburst, just before and after
the hard-to-soft state transition. At these luminosities, it is essential to include radiation
driving, and we include not only electron scattering, but also photoelectric and line interactions.
We find powerful outflows with $\rm{\dot{M}_{wind} \simeq 2 \,\dot{M}_{acc}}$ are driven by thermal
and radiation pressure in both hard and soft states. The hard-state wind is significantly faster
and carries approximately 20 times as much kinetic energy as the soft-state wind. However, in the
hard state the wind is more ionized, and so weaker X-ray absorption lines are seen over a narrower
range of viewing angles. Nevertheless, for inclinations $\gtrsim 80^{\circ}$, blue-shifted
wind-formed Fe XXV and Fe XXVI features should be observable even in the hard state. Given that the
data required to detect these lines currently exist for only a single system in a {\em luminous} hard
state -- the peculiar GRS~1915+105 -- we urge the acquisition of new observations to test this prediction.
The new generation of X-ray spectrometers should be able to resolve the velocity structure.
