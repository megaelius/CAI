We present measurements of [SIII]$\lambda\lambda$9069,9531 for a sample of $z\sim1.5$ star-forming
galaxies, the first sample with measurements of these lines at z>0.1. We employ the line ratio S$_{32}$$\equiv$[SIII]$\lambda\lambda$9069,9531/[SII]$\lambda\lambda$6716,6731
as a novel probe of evolving ISM conditions. Since this ratio includes the low-ionization line [SII],
it is crucial that the effects of diffuse ionized gas (DIG) on emission-line ratios be accounted
for in $z\sim0$ integrated galaxy spectra, or else that comparisons be made to samples of local HII
regions in which DIG emission is not present. We find that S$_{32}$ decreases with increasing stellar
mass at both $z\sim1.5$ and $z\sim0$, but that the dependence is weak suggesting S$_{32}$ has a very
shallow anticorrelation with metallicity, in contrast with O$_{32}$ that displays a strong metallicity
dependence. As a result, S$_{32}$ only mildly evolves with redshift at fixed stellar mass. The $z\sim1.5$
sample is systematicallty offset towards lower S$_{32}$ and higher [SII]/H$\alpha$ at fixed [OIII]/H$\beta$
relative to $z=0$ HII regions. By comparing to photoionization model grids, we find that such trends
can be explained by a scenario in which the ionizing spectrum is harder at fixed O/H with increasing
redshift, but are inconsistent with an increase in ionization parameter at fixed O/H. This analysis
demonstrates the advantages of expanding beyond the strongest rest-optical lines for evolutionary
studies, and the particular utility of [SIII] for characterizing evolving ISM conditions and stellar
compositions. These measurements provide a basis for estimating [SIII] line strengths for high-redshift
galaxies, a line that the James Webb Space Telescope will measure out to z~5.5.
