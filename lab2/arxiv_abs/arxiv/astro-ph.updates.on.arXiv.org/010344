Aims. We aim to constrain the size and porosity of ejected dust particles from comet 252P/LINEAR
and their evolution near the perihelion via near-infrared multiband polarimetry. A close approach
of the comet to the Earth in March 2016 (~0.036 au) provided a rare opportunity for the sampling of
the comet with a high spatial resolution. Methods. We made NIR JHKS bands polarimetric observations
of the comet for 12 days near perihelion, interspersed between broadband optical imaging observations
over four months. In addition, dynamical simulation of the comet was performed 1000 yr backward
in time. Results. We detected two discontinuous brightness enhancements. Before the first enhancement,
the NIR polarization degrees were far lower than those of ordinary comets at a given phase angle.
Soon after the activation, however, they increased by ~13 % at most, showing unusual blue polarimetric
color over the J and H bands (-2.55 % / um on average) and bluing of both J-H and H-Ks dust color. Throughout
the event, the polarization vector was marginally aligned perpendicular to the scattering plane.
The subsequent postperihelion reactivation of the comet lasted for approximately 1.5 months,
with a factor of ~30 times pre-activation dust mass-loss rates in the Rc band. Conclusions. The marked
increase in the polarization degree with blue NIR polarimetric color is reminiscent of the behaviors
of a fragmenting comet D/1999 S4 (LINEAR). The most plausible scenario for the observed polarimetric
properties of 252P/LINEAR would be an ejection of predominantly large, compact dust particles
from the desiccated surface layer. We conjecture that the more intense solar heating that the comet
has received in the near-Earth orbit would cause the paucity of small, fluffy dust particles around
the nucleus of the comet.
