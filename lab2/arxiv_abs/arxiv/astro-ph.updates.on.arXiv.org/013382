A new generation of coronagraphs to study the solar wind and CMEs are being developed and launched.
These coronagraphs will heavily rely on multi-channel observations where visible light (VL) and
UV-EUV observations provide new plasma diagnostics. One of these instruments, Metis on board ESA-Solar
Orbiter, will simultaneously observe VL and the UV Lyman-$\alpha$ line. The number of neutral Hydrogen
atoms (a small fraction of coronal protons) is a key parameter for deriving plasma properties such
as temperature from the observed Lyman-$\alpha$ line intensity. However, these measurements
are significantly affected if non-equilibrium ionisation effects occur. The aim of this work is
to determine if non-equilibrium ionisation effects are relevant in CMEs and in particular when
and in which regions of the CME. We use a magneto-hydrodynamic simulation of a magnetic flux rope
ejection to generate a CME. From this we then reconstruct the ionisation state of Hydrogen atoms
in the CME by evaluating both the advection of neutral and ionised Hydrogen atoms and the ionisation
and recombination rates in the MHD simulation. We find that the equilibrium ionisation assumption
holds mostly in the core of the CME. In contrast non-equilibrium ionisation effects are significant
at the CME front, where we find about 100 times more neutral Hydrogen atoms than prescribed by ionisation
equilibrium conditions, even if this neutral Hydrogen excess might be difficult to identify due
to projection effects. This work provides key information for the development of a new generation
of diagnostic techniques that aim at combining visible light and Lyman-$\alpha$ line emissions.
The results show that non-ionisation equilibrium effects need to be considered when we analyse
CME fronts. To incorrectly assume equilibrium ionisation in these regions would lead to a systematic
underestimate of plasma temperatures.
