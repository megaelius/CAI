We have investigated the outburst properties of low-mass X-ray binary transients (LMXBTs) based
on a comprehensive study of the outbursts observed in the past few decades. The outburst rates were
estimated based on the X-ray monitoring data from Swift/BAT, RXTE/ASM and MAXI, and previous reports
in the literature. We found that almost all LMXBTs with the orbital period below $\sim$12 hr showed
only one outburst in these observations. There are systematic difference in the outburst rate between
long-period ($P_{\rm orb} \gtrsim$ 12 hr) and short-period ($P_{\rm orb} \lesssim$ 12 hr) systems.
We infer that mass transfer rate is responsible for the systematic difference, since the disk instability
model (DIM) suggested that the mass transfer rate is a key factor affecting the quiescence time.
The difference in outburst rate between long-period and short-period LMXBTs is probably due to
the different mass transfer mechanism at different evolutionary stages of the donors. Based on
the evolutionary tracks of single stars, we derived the critical orbital period for X-ray binaries
that harbor a subgiant donor in various metallicity. The critical orbital period ($P_{\rm orb,crit}=$12.4
hr) is consistent with the above orbital period boundary obtained from the statistics of outburst
rates. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between the outburst rate and the orbital period
in the samples for which the luminosity class of the donor star is III/IV. The best-fitting power-law
index for the black hole subsamples is roughly consistent with the theoretical prediction for those
systems with a donor star evolved off the main sequence.
