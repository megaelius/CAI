We have constructed a mass-selected sample of Mstar>10^11Msolar galaxies at 1<z<3 in
the CANDELS UDS and COSMOS fields and have decomposed these systems into their separate bulge and
disk components according to their H(160)-band morphologies. By extending this analysis to multiple
bands we have been able to conduct individual bulge and disk component SED fitting which has provided
us with stellar-mass and star-formation rate estimates for the separate bulge and disk components.
These have been combined with size measurements to explore the evolution of these massive high-redshift
galaxies. By utilising the new decomposed stellar-mass estimates, we confirm that the bulge components
display a stronger size evolution than the disks. This can be seen from both the fraction of bulge
components which lie below the local relation and the median sizes of the bulge components, where
the bulges are a median factor of 2.93+/-0.32 times smaller than similarly massive local galaxies
at 1<z<2 and 3.41+/-0.58 smaller at 2<z<3; for the disks the corresponding factors
are 1.65+/-0.14 and 1.99+/-0.25. Moreover, by splitting our sample into the passive and star-forming
bulge and disk sub-populations and examining their sizes as a fraction of their present-day counter-parts,
we find that the star-forming and passive bulges are equally compact, star-forming disks are larger,
while the passive disks have intermediate sizes. This trend is not evident when classifying galaxy
morphology on the basis of single-Sersic fits and adopting the overall star-formation rates. Finally,
by evolving the star-formation histories of the passive disks back to the redshifts when the passive
disks were last active, we show that the passive and star-forming disks have consistent sizes at
the relevant epoch. These trends need to be reproduced by any mechanisms which attempt to explain
the morphological evolution of galaxies.
