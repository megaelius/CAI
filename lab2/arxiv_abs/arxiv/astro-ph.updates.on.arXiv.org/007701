We present the Galactic merger rate for double neutron star (DNS) binaries using the observed sample
of eight DNS systems merging within a Hubble time. This sample includes the recently discovered,
highly relativistic DNS systems J1757$-$1854 and J1946+2052, and is approximately three times
the sample size used in previous estimates of the Galactic merger rate by Kim et al. Using this sample,
we calculate the vertical scale height for DNS systems in the Galaxy to be $z_0 = 0.4 \pm 0.1$ kpc. We
calculate a Galactic DNS merger rate of $\mathcal{R}_{\rm MW} = 42^{+30}_{-14}$ Myr$^{-1}$ at
the 90% confidence level. The corresponding DNS merger detection rate for Advanced LIGO is $\mathcal{R}_{\rm
LIGO} = 0.18^{+0.13}_{-0.06} \times \left( D_{\rm r}/100 \ \rm Mpc \right)^3 \rm yr^{-1}$, where
$D_{\rm r}$ is the range distance. Using this merger detection rate and the predicted range distance
of 120$-$170 Mpc for the third observing run of LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave
Observatory, Abbott et al.), we predict, accounting for 90% confidence intervals, that LIGO$-$Virgo
will detect anywhere between zero and two DNS mergers. We explore the effects of the underlying pulsar
population properties on the merger rate and compare our merger detection rate with those estimated
using different formation and evolutionary scenario of DNS systems. As we demonstrate, reconciling
the rates is sensitive to assumptions about the DNS population, including its radio pulsar luminosity
function. Future constraints from further gravitational wave DNS detections and pulsar surveys
anticipated in the near future should permit tighter constraints on these assumptions.
