To explore the evolutionary connection among red, green, and blue galaxy populations, based on
a sample of massive ($M_* > 10^{10} M_{\odot} $) galaxies at 0.5<z<2.5 in five 3D-HST/CANDELS fields,
we investigate the dust content, morphologies, structures, AGN fractions, and environments of
these three galaxy populations. Green valley galaxies are found to have intermediate dust attenuation,
and reside in the middle of the regions occupied by quiescent and star-forming galaxies in the UVJ
diagram. Compared with blue and red galaxy populations at z<2, green galaxies have intermediate
compactness and morphological parameters such as Sersic index, concentration, Gini coefficient,
and the second order moment of the 20% brightest pixels of a galaxy. Above findings seem to favor the
scenario that green galaxies are at transitional phase when star-forming galaxies are being quenched
into quiescent status. The green galaxies at z<2 show the highest AGN fraction, suggesting that
AGN feedback may have played an important role in star formation quenching. For the massive galaxies
at 2<z<2.5, both red and green galaxies are found to have a similarly higher AGN fraction than the
blue ones, which implies that AGN feedback may help to keep quiescence of red galaxies at z>2. A significant
environmental difference is found between green and red galaxies at z<1.5. Green and blue galaxies
at z>0.5 seem to have similar local density distributions, suggesting that environment quenching
is not the major mechanism to cease star formation at z>0.5. The fractions of three populations as
functions of mass support a "downsizing" quenching picture that the bulk of star formation in more
massive galaxies is completed earlier than that of lower mass galaxies.
