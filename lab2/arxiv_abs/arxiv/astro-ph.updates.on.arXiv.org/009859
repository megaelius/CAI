We report the serendipitous detection of two 3 mm continuum sources found in deep ALMA Band 3 observations
to study intermediate redshift galaxies in the COSMOS field. One is near a foreground galaxy at 1.3",
but is a previously unknown dust-obscured star-forming galaxy (DSFG) at probable $z_{CO}=3.329$,
illustrating the risk of misidentifying shorter wavelength counterparts. The optical-to-mm
spectral energy distribution (SED) favors a grey $\lambda^{-0.4}$ attenuation curve and results
in significantly larger stellar mass and SFR compared to a Calzetti starburst law, suggesting caution
when relating progenitors and descendants based on these quantities. The other source is missing
from all previous optical/near-infrared/sub-mm/radio catalogs ("ALMA-only"), and remains
undetected even in stacked ultradeep optical ($>29.6$ AB) and near-infrared ($>27.9$ AB) images.
Using the ALMA position as a prior reveals faint $SNR\sim3$ measurements in stacked IRAC 3.6+4.5,
ultradeep SCUBA2 850$\mu$m, and VLA 3GHz, indicating the source is real. The SED is robustly reproduced
by a massive $M^*=10^{10.8}$M$_\odot$ and $M_{gas}=10^{11}$M$_\odot$, highly obscured $A_V\sim4$,
star forming $SFR\sim300$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ galaxy at redshift $z=5.5\pm$1.1. The ultrasmall
8 arcmin$^{2}$ survey area implies a large yet uncertain contribution to the cosmic star formation
rate density CSFRD(z=5) $\sim0.9\times10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, comparable
to all ultraviolet-selected galaxies combined. These results indicate the existence of a prominent
population of DSFGs at $z>4$, below the typical detection limit of bright galaxies found in single-dish
sub-mm surveys, but with larger space densities $\sim3 \times 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, higher duty
cycles $50-100\%$, contributing more to the CSFRD, and potentially dominating the high-mass galaxy
stellar mass function.
