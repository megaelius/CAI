State-of-the-art stellar structure and evolution codes fail to adequately describe turbulent
convection. For stars with convective envelopes, such as red giants, this leads to an incomplete
depiction of the surface layers. As a result, the predicted stellar oscillation frequencies are
haunted by systematic errors, the so-called surface effect. Different empirically and theoretically
motivated correction relations have been proposed to deal with this issue. In this paper, we compare
the performance of these surface correction relations for red giant branch stars. For this purpose,
we apply the different surface correction relations in asteroseismic analyses of eclipsing binaries
and open clusters. In accordance with previous studies of main-sequence stars, we find that the
use of different surface correction relations biases the derived global stellar properties, including
stellar age, mass, and distance estimates. We furthermore demonstrate that the different relations
lead to the same systematic errors for two different open clusters. Our results overall discourage
from the use of surface correction relations that rely on reference stars to calibrate free parameters.
Due to the demonstrated systematic biasing of the results, the use of appropriate surface correction
relations is imperative to any asteroseismic analysis of red giants. Accurate mass, age, and distance
estimates for red giants are fundamental when addressing questions that deal with the chemo-dynamical
evolution of the Milky Way galaxy. In this way, our results also have implications for fields, such
as galactic archaeology, that draw on findings from stellar physics.
