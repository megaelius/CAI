Most exoplanets detected so far have atmospheric T significantly higher than 300K. Often close
to their star, they receive an intense UV photons flux that triggers important photodissociation
processes. The T dependency of VUV absorption cross sections are poorly known, leading to an undefined
uncertainty in atmospheric models. Similarly, data measured at low T similar to that of the high
atmosphere of Mars, Venus, and Titan are often lacking. Our aim is to quantify the T dependency of
the abs. cross section of important molecules in planetary atmospheres. We want to provide both
high-resolution data at T prevailing in these media and a simple parameterization of the absorption
in order to simplify its use in photochemical models. This study focuses on carbon dioxide. We performed
experimental measurements of CO$_2$ absorption cross section with synchrotron radiation for
the wavelength range (115--200nm). For longer wavelengths (195--230nm), we used a deuterium lamp
and a 1.5m Jobin-Yvon spectrometer. We used these data in our 1D thermo-photochemical model in order
to study their impact on the predicted atmospheric compositions. The cross section of CO$_2$ increases
with T. It can be separated in two parts: a continuum and a fine structure superimposed on the continuum.
The variation of the continuum of absorption can be represented by the sum of three gaussian functions.
Using data at high T in thermo-photochemical models modifies significantly the abundance and the
photodissociation rates of many species, in addition to CO$_2$, such as methane and ammonia. These
deviations have an impact on synthetic transmission spectra, leading to variations of up to 5 ppm.
We present a full set of HR ($\Delta \lambda$=0.03nm) absorption cross sections of CO$_2$ from 115
to 230nm for T ranging from 150 to 800K.
