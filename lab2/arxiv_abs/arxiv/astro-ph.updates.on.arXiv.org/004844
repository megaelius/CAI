We investigate the connection between star formation and molecular gas properties in galaxy mergers
at low redshift (z$\leq$0.06). The study we present is based on IRAM 30-m CO(1-0) observations of
11 galaxies with a close companion selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The pairs have
mass ratios $\leq$4, projected separations r$_{\mathrm{p}} \leq$30 kpc and velocity separations
$\Delta$V$\leq$300 km s$^{-1}$, and have been selected to exhibit enhanced specific star formation
rates (sSFR). We calculate molecular gas (H$_{2}$) masses, assigning to each galaxy a physically
motivated conversion factor $\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}$, and we derive molecular gas fractions and
depletion times. We compare these quantities with those of isolated galaxies from the extended
CO Legacy Data base for the GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey sample (xCOLDGASS, Saintonge et al. 2017) with
gas quantities computed in an identical way. Ours is the first study which directly compares the
gas properties of galaxy pairs and those of a control sample of normal galaxies with rigorous control
procedures and for which SFR and H$_{2}$ masses have been estimated using the same method. We find
that the galaxy pairs have shorter depletion times and an average molecular gas fraction enhancement
of 0.4 dex compared to the mass matched control sample drawn from xCOLDGASS. However, the gas masses
(and fractions) in galaxy pairs and their depletion times are consistent with those of non-mergers
whose SFRs are similarly elevated. We conclude that both external interactions and internal processes
may lead to molecular gas enhancement and decreased depletion times.
