We use data from Cassini's Composite Infrared Spectrometer CIRS to map Mimas' surface temperatures
and its thermophysical properties. This provides a dramatic improvement on the work in Howett et
al. (2011), where the values were determined at only two regions on Mimas (one inside, and another
outside of the anomalous region). We use all spatially-resolved scans made by CIRS' focal plane
3 (FP3, 600 to 1100 cm-1) of Mimas' surface, which are largely daytime observations but do include
one nighttime one. The resulting temperature maps confirm the presence and location of Mimas' previously
discovered thermally anomalous region. No other thermally anomalous regions were discovered,
although we note that the surface coverage is incomplete on Mimas' leading and anti-Saturn hemisphere.
The thermal inertia map confirms that the anomalous region has a notably higher thermal inertia
than its surroundings: 98 +/- 42 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2 inside of the anomaly, compared to 34 +/- 32 J m-2 K-1
s-1/2 outside. The albedo inside and outside of the anomalous region agrees within their uncertainty:
0.45+/-0.08 inside compared to 0.41 +/- 0.07 outside the anomaly. Interestingly the albedo appears
brighter inside the anomaly region, which may not be surprising given this region does appear brighter
at some UV wavelengths (0.338 microns, see Schenk et al., 2011). However, this result should be treated
with caution because, as previously stated, statistically the albedo of these two regions is the
same when their uncertainties are considered. These thermal inertia and albedo values determined
here are consistent with those found by Howett et al. (2011), who determined the thermal inertia
inside the anomaly to be 66 +/- 23 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2 and less than 16 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2 outside, with albedos
that varied from 0.49 to 0.70.
