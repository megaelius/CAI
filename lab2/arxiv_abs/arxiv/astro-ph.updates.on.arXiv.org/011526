Infrared photometry in the J (1.2 microns), H (1.7 microns), Ks (2.2 microns) bands from the 2MASS
catalogue and in the W1 (3.4 microns), W2 (4.6 microns), W3 (12 microns), W4 (22 microns) bands from
the WISE catalogue is used to reveal the spatial variations of the interstellar extinction law in
the infrared near the midplane of the Galaxy by the method of extrapolation of the extinction law
applied to clump giants. The variations of the coefficients E(H-W1)/E(H-Ks), E(H-W2)/E(H-Ks),
E(H-W3)/E(H-Ks), and E(H-W4)/E(H-Ks) along the line of sight in 2 deg per 2 deg squares of the sky
centered at b=0 and l=20, 30, ..., 330, 340 deg as well as in several 4 deg per 4 deg squares with |b|=10
are considered. The results obtained here agree with those obtained by Zasowski et al. in 2009 using
2MASS and Spitzer-IRAC photometry for the same longitudes and similar photometric bands, confirming
their main result: in the inner (relative to the Sun) Galactic disk, the fraction of fine dust increases
with Galactocentric distance (or the mean dust grain size decreases). However, in the outer Galactic
disk that was not considered by Zasowski et al., this trend is reversed: at the disk edge, the fraction
of coarse dust is larger than that in the solar neighborhood. This general Galactic trend seems to
be explained by the influence of the spiral pattern: its processes sort the dust by size and fragment
it so that coarse and fine dust tend to accumulate, respectively, at the outer and inner (relative
to the Galactic center) edges of the spiral arms. As a result, fine dust may exist only in the part of
the Galactic disk far from both the Galactic center and the edge, while coarse dust dominates at the
Galactic center, at the disk edge, and outside the disk.
