The $M_{BH}$ - $\sigma_{\star}$ relation is considered a result of co-evolution between the host
galaxies and their super-massive black holes. For elliptical-bulge hosting inactive galaxies,
this relation is well established, but there is still a debate whether active galaxies follow the
same relation. In this paper, we estimate black hole masses for a sample of 19 local luminous AGNs
(LLAMA) in order to test their location on the $M_{BH}$ - $\sigma_{\star}$ relation. Super-massive
black hole masses ($M_{BH}$) were derived from the broad-line based relations for H$\alpha$, H$\beta$
and Pa$\beta$ emission line profiles for the Type 1 AGNs. We compare the bulge stellar velocity dispersion
($\sigma_{\star}$) as determined from the Ca II triplet (CaT) with the dispersion measured from
the near-infrared CO (2-0) absorption features for each AGN and find them to be consistent with each
other. We apply an extinction correction to the observed broad line fluxes and we correct the stellar
velocity dispersion by an average rotation contribution as determined from spatially resolved
stellar kinematic maps. The H$\alpha$-based black hole masses of our sample of AGNs were estimated
in the range 6.34 $\leq$ $\log{M_{BH}}$ $\leq$ 7.75 M$_\odot$ and the $\sigma_{\star CaT}$ estimates
range between 73 $\leq$ $\sigma_{\star CaT}$ $\leq$ 227 km s$^{-1}$. From the so-constructed $M_{BH}$
- $\sigma_{\star}$ relation for our Type 1 AGNs, we estimate the black hole masses for the Type 2 AGNs
and the inactive galaxies in our sample. In conclusion, we find that our sample of local luminous
AGNs is consistent with the $M_{BH}$ - $\sigma_{\star}$ relation of lower luminosity AGNs and inactive
galaxies, after correcting for dust extinction and the rotational contribution to the stellar
velocity dispersion.
