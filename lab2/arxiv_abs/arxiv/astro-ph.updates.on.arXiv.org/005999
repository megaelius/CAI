We present a statistical study of chromospheric evaporation in solar flares using simultaneous
observations by the RHESSI X-ray telescope and the IRIS UV spectrograph. The results are compared
with radiation hydrodynamic flare models from the F-CHROMA RADYN database. For each event, we study
spatially-resolved Doppler shifts of spectral lines formed in the transition region (C II 1334.5
A) and hot coronal plasma (Fe XXI 1354.1 A) to investigate the dynamics of the solar atmosphere during
the flare impulsive phase. We estimate the energy fluxes deposited by high-energy electrons using
X-ray imaging spectroscopy and assuming the standard thick-target model. Using the RADYN flare
models, the RH 1.5D radiative transfer code and the Chianti atomic line database, we calculate C
II and Fe XXI line profiles and compare with the observations. While the models predict a correlation
between the Doppler shifts and deposited energy flux for both lines, this was only observed in the
C II data, and not in the Fe XXI data. In addition, the C II and Fe XXI Doppler shifts are not correlated
with each other in the observations and strongly correlated in models. Several quantitative discrepancies
are found between the observations and models: the Fe XXI Doppler shifts are substantially stronger
in the models than in the data, the C II mean blueshifts are absent in the observations but predicted
by the models. The transition energy between "gentle" and "explosive" evaporation regimes derived
from the observations ($2-8 \times{} 10^{9}$~erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$) and the models ($2.2-8.3
\times{} 10^{9}$~erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$) are comparable with each other. The results illustrate,
for the first time, observational relationships among the processes of chromospheric evaporation,
response of the colder layers, and the flare energy flux deposited by high-energy electrons.
