Within the NaCo-ISPY exoplanet imaging program, we aim at detecting and characterizing the population
of low-mass companions at wide separations ($\gtrsim$10AU), focusing in particular on young stars
either hosting a known protoplanetary disk or a debris disk. R CrA is one of the youngest (1-3 Myr)
and most promising objects in our sample because of two previous studies that suggested the presence
of a close companion. Our aim is to directly image and characterize the companion for the first time.
We observed R CrA twice with the NaCo instrument at VLT in the $L'$ filter with a one year time baseline
in between. The high-contrast imaging data were reduced and analyzed, and in both datasets the companion
candidate was detected. The companion is detected at a separation of $196.8\pm4.5$/$196.6\pm5.9$
mas ($18.7\pm1.3$/$18.7\pm1.4$ AU) and position angle of $134.7\pm0.5^\circ/133.7\pm0.7^\circ$
in the first/second epoch observation. We measure a contrast of $7.29\pm0.18$/$6.70\pm0.15$
mag with respect to the primary. Stellar proper motion study rejects the hypothesis of the signal
being a background object. The companion candidate orbits in the clockwise direction and, if on
a face-on circular orbit, its period is $\sim43-47$ yr. This value disagrees with the estimated
orbital motion and therefore a face-on circular orbit may be excluded. Depending on the assumed
age, extinction and brightness of the primary, the stellar companion has a mass between $0.10\pm0.02\,
M_\odot$ and $1.03^{+0.20}_{-0.18}\,M_\odot$ range, if no contribution from circumsecondary
material is taken into account. The presence of the companion needs to be taken into account when
analyzing the complex circumstellar environment of R CrA.
