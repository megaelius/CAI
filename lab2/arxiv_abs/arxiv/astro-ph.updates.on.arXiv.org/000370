Several efforts are currently made from space missions in order to get accurate solar astrometric
measurements i.e. to probe the long term variations of solar radius or shape, their link with solar
irradiance variations and their influence on earth climate. These space missions use full disk
solar imagery. In order to test our ability to perform such measurements from ground on the long term,
we need to use similar techniques and instruments simultaneously from ground and space. This should
help us to model and understand how the atmosphere affect ground based metrologic measurements.
However, using full imagery from ground instead of the traditional astrolabe technique immediatly
raise the question of the effect of refraction and how well we can correct from it. The goal is to study
in details the influence of pure astronomical refraction on solar metrologic measurements made
from ground-based full disk imagery and to provide the tools for correcting the measurements and
estimating the associated uncertainties. We use both analytical and numerical methods in order
to confront commonly or historically used approximations and exact solutions. We provide the exact
formulae for correcting solar radius measurements at any heliographic angle and for any zenith
distance. We show that these corrections can be applyed up to 80 degree of zenith distance provided
that full numerical integration of the refraction integral is used. We also provide estimates of
the absolute uncertainties associated with the differential refraction corrections and shows
that approximate formulae can be used up to 80 degree of zenith distance for computing these uncertainties.
For a given instrumental setup and the knowledge of the uncertainties associated with local weather
records, this can be used to fix the maximum zenith distance one can observe depending on the required
astrometric accuracy.
