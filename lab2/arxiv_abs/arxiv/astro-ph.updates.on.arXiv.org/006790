We use Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) to place 252 Herbig Ae/Be stars in the HR diagram and investigate their
characteristics and properties. For all known Herbig Ae/Be stars with parallaxes in Gaia DR2, we
collected their atmospheric parameters and photometric and extinction values from the literature.
To these data we added near- and mid-infrared photometry, collected H$\alpha$ equivalent widths
and line profiles, and their binarity status. In addition, we developed a photometric variability
indicator from Gaia's DR2 information. We provide masses, ages, luminosities, distances, variabilities
and infrared excesses homogeneously derived for the most complete sample of Herbig Ae/Be stars
to date. We find that high mass stars have a much smaller infrared excess and have much lower optical
variabilities compared to lower mass stars, with the break at around 7M$_{\odot}$. H$\alpha$ emission
is generally correlated with infrared excess, with the correlation being stronger for infrared
emission at wavelengths tracing the hot dust closest to the star. The variability indicator as developed
by us shows that $\sim$25% of all Herbig Ae/Be stars are strongly variable. We observe that the strongly
variable objects display doubly peaked H$\alpha$ line profiles, indicating an edge-on disk. The
fraction of strongly variable Herbig Ae stars is close to that found for A-type UX Ori stars. It had
been suggested that this variability is in most cases due to asymmetric dusty disk structures seen
edge-on. The observation here is in strong support of this hypothesis. Finally, the difference
in dust properties occurs at 7M$_{\odot}$, while various properties traced at UV/optical wavelengths
differ at 3M$_{\odot}$. The latter has been linked to different accretion mechanisms at work whereas
the differing infrared properties and variabilities are related to different (dust-)disk dispersal
mechanisms.
