It has been known for a long time that stellar metallicity plays a significant role in the determination
of the ages of the different Galactic stellar populations, when main sequence evolutionary tracks
are employed. Here we analyze the role that metallicity plays on the white dwarf luminosity function
of the Galactic disk, which is often used to determine its age. We employ a Monte Carlo population
synthesis code that accounts for the properties of the population of Galactic disk white dwarfs.
Our code incorporates the most up-to-date evolutionary cooling sequences for white dwarfs with
hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-deficient atmospheres for both carbon-oxygen and oxygen-neon cores.
We use two different models to assess the evolution of the metallicity, one in which the adopted metallicity
is constant with time, but with a moderate dispersion, and a second one in which the metallicity increases
with time. We found that our theoretical results are in a very satisfactory agreement with the observational
luminosity functions obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and from the SuperCOSMOS
Sky Survey (SSS), independently of the adopted age-metallicity law. In particular, we found that
the age-metallicity law has no noticeable impact in shaping the bright branch of the white dwarf
luminosity function, and that the position of its cut-off is almost insensitive to the adopoted
age-metallicity relationship. Because the shape of the bright branch of the white dwarf luminosity
function is insensitive to the age-metallicity law, it can be safely employed to test the theoretical
evolutionary sequences, while due to the limited sensitivity of the position of the drop-off to
the distribution of metallicities, its location provides a robust indicator of the age of the Galactic
disk.
