Organic aerosols accumulated in Titan's orange haze start forming in its ionosphere. This upper
part of the atmosphere is highly reactive and complex ion chemistry takes place at altitudes from
1200 to 900 km. The ionosphere is a nitrogen plasma with a few percent of methane and hydrogen. Carbon
from methane enables the formation of macromolecules with long organic chains, finally leading
to the organic aerosols. On the other hand, we suspect that hydrogen and the protonated ions have
a different erosive effect on the aerosols. Here we experimentally studied the effect of hydrogen
and protonated species on organic aerosols. Analogues of Titan's aerosols were formed in a CCP RF
plasma discharge in 95% N2 and 5% CH4. Thereafter, the aerosols were exposed to a DC plasma in 99% N2
and 1% H2. Samples were analysed by scanning electron microscopy and in situ infrared transmission
spectroscopy. Two pellet techniques - KBr pressed pellets and thin metallic grids - were compared
to confirm that modifications seen are not due to the material used to make the pellet. We observed
that the spherical aerosols of ~500 nm in diameter were eroded under N2-H2 plasma exposure, with
the formation of holes of ~10 nm at their surface. Aerosols were globally removed from the pellet
by the plasma. IR spectra showed a faster disappearance of isonitriles and/or carbo-diimides compared
to the global band of nitriles. The opposite effect was seen with beta-unsaturated nitriles and/or
cyanamides. Double bonds as C=C and C=N were more affected than amines and C-H bonds. N-H and C-H absorption
bands kept a similar ratio in intensity and their shape did not vary. Therefore, it seems that carbon
and hydrogen play opposite roles in Titan's ionosphere: the carbon from methane lead to organic
growth while hydrogen and protonated species erode the aerosols and react preferentially with
unsaturated chemical functions.
