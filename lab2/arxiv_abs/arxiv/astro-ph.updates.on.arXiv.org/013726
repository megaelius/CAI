Context: White dwarfs (WDs) are important and abundant tools to study the structure and evolution
of the Galactic environment. However, the multiplicity of WD progenitors is generally neglected.
Specifically, a merger in a binary system can lead to a single WD, which could result in wrongly inferred
quantities if only single stellar evolution (SSE) is considered. These mergers are linked to transients
such as luminous red novae and Type Ia supernovae. Aims: We investigate the impact of binary evolution
(BE) upon observable single WDs, and compare their properties to WDs formed through SSE. We assess
the evolutionary channels and the age and mass distributions of the resulting single Wds. Methods:
We employed \texttt{SeBa} to model the evolution of single star and binary populations. We synthesised
the observable single WD population within $100$ pc, including cooling and observational selection
effects. Additionally, we constructed models with different evolution and primordial population
properties to study the effects on the properties of the resulting single WDs. Results: White dwarfs
from binary mergers make up about $10-30\%$ of all observable single WDs and $30-50\%$ of massive
WDs. On average, individual WDs take $3.1-5$ times longer to form through BE than SE, and so appear
${\sim} 1$ Gyr younger than they are if BE is ignored. In all models, the effect of mergers on the age
distribution is clearly noticeable. The median age typically increases by $85-430$ Myr and $200-390$
Myr for massive WDs. Although abundant, we do not find evidence that WDs from mergers significantly
alter the shape of the WD mass distribution. Conclusions: Assuming SSE for inferring properties
of single WDs gives rise to intrinsic errors as single WDs can also be formed following a binary merger.
Strategies for mitigating the effect of mergers on the WD age distributions are discussed.
