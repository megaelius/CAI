Compact multi-planet systems containing super-Earths or sub-Neptunes, commonly found around
solar-type stars, may be surrounded by external giant planet or stellar companions, which can shape
the architechture and observability of the inner systems. We present a comprehensive study on the
evolution of the inner planetary system subject to the gravitational influence of an eccentric,
misaligned outer perturber. Analytic results are derived for the inner planet eccentricities
($e_i$) and mutual inclination ($\theta_{12}$) of the "2-planet + perturber" system, calibrated
with numerical secular and N-body integrations, as a function of the perturber mass $m_p$, semi-major
axis $a_p$ and inclination angle $\theta_p$. We find that the dynamics of the inner system is determined
by the dimensionless parameter $\epsilon_{12}$, given by the ratio between the differential precession
rate driven by the perturber and the mutual precession rate of the inner planets. Loosely packed
systems (corresponding to $\epsilon_{12} \gg 1$) are more susceptible to eccentricity/inclination
excitations by the perturber than tightly packed inner systems (with $\epsilon_{12} \ll 1$) (or
singletons), although resonance may occur around $\epsilon_{12}\sim 1$, leading to large $e_i$
and $\theta_{12}$. Dynamical instability may set in for inner planet systems with large excited
eccentricities and mutual inclinations. We present a formalism to extend our analytical results
to general inner systems with $N>2$ planets and apply our results to constrain possible external
companions to the Kepler-11 system. Eccentricity and inclination excitation by external companions
may help explain the observational trend that systems with fewer transiting planets are dynamically
hotter than those with more transiting planets.
