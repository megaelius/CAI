Type I X-ray bursts in GS 1826-24, and in several other systems, may induce cooling of the hot inner
accretion flow that surrounds the bursting neutron star. Given that GS 1826-24 remained persistently
in the hard state over the period 2003-2008 and presented regular bursting properties, we stacked
the spectra of the X-ray bursts detected by INTEGRAL (JEM-X and ISGRI) and XMM-Newton (RGS) during
that period to study the effect of the burst photons on the properties of the Comptonizing medium.
The extended energy range provided by these instruments allows the simultaneous observation of
the burst and persistent emission spectra. We detect an overall change in the shape of the persistent
emission spectrum in response to the burst photon shower. For the first time, we observe simultaneously
a drop in the hard X-ray emission, together with a soft X-ray excess with respect to the burst blackbody
emission. The hard X-ray drop can be explained by burst-induced coronal cooling, while the bulk
of the soft X-ray excess can be described by fitting the burst emission with an atmosphere model,
instead of a simple blackbody model. Traditionally, the persistent emission was assumed to be invariant
during X-ray bursts, and more recently to change only in normalization but not in spectral shape;
the observed change in the persistent emission level during X-ray bursts may thus trigger the revision
of existing neutron star mass-radius constraints, as the derived values rely on the assumption
that the persistent emission does not change during X-ray bursts. The traditional burst fitting
technique leads to up to a 10% overestimation of the bolometric burst flux in GS 1826-24, which significantly
hampers the comparisons of the KEPLER and MESA model against this 'textbook burster'.
