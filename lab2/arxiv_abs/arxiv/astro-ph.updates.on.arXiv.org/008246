Is the present-day water-land ratio a necessary outcome of the evolution of plate tectonic planets
with a similar age, volume, mass, and total water inventory as the Earth? This would be the case - largely
independent of initial conditions - if Earth's present-day continental volume were at a stable
unique equilibrium with strong self-regulating mechanisms of continental growth steering the
evolution to this state. In this paper, we question this conjecture. Instead we suggest that positive
feedbacks in the plate tectonics model of continental production and erosion may dominate and show
that such a model can explain the history of continental growth. We investigate the main mechanisms
that contribute to the growth of the volume of the continental crust. In particular, we analyze the
effect of the oceanic plate speed, depending on the area and thickness of thermally insulating continents,
on production and erosion mechanisms. Effects that cause larger continental production rates
for larger values of continental volume are positive feedbacks. In contrast, negative feedbacks
act to stabilize the continental volume. They are provided by the increase of the rate of surface
erosion, subduction erosion, and crustal delamination with the continental volume. We systematically
analyze the strengths of positive and negative feedback contributions to the growth of the continental
crust. Although the strengths of some feedbacks depend on poorly known parameters, we conclude
that a net predominance of positive feedbacks is plausible. We explore the effect of the combined
feedback strength on the feasibility of modeling the observed small positive net continental growth
rate over the past 2-3 billion years.
