Isotopologue line intensity ratios of circumstellar molecules have been widely used to trace the
photospheric elemental isotopic ratios of evolved stars. However, depending on the molecular
species and the physical conditions of the environment, the circumstellar isotopologue ratio
may deviate considerably from the stellar atmospheric value. In this paper, we aim to examine how
the CO and HCN abundance ratios vary radially due to chemical reactions in the outflows of AGB stars
and the effect of excitation and optical depth on the resulting line intensity ratios. We find that
the circumstellar 12CO/13CO can deviate from its atmospheric value by up to 25-94% and 6-60% for
C- and O-type CSEs, respectively. We show that variations of the intensity of the ISRF and the gas
kinetic temperature can significantly influence the CO isotopologue ratio in the outer CSEs. On
the contrary, the H12CN/H13CN ratio is stable for all tested mass-loss rates. The RT modeling shows
that the integrated line intensity ratio of CO of different rotational transitions varies significantly
for stars with intermediate mass-loss rates due to combined chemical and excitation effects. In
contrast, the excitation conditions for the both HCN isotopologues are the same. We demonstrate
the importance of using the isotopologue abundance profiles from chemical models as inputs to RT
models in the interpretation of isotopologue observations. Previous studies of CO isotopologue
ratios are based on multi-transition data for individual sources and it is difficult to estimate
the errors in the reported values due to assumptions that are not entirely correct according to this
study. If anything, previous studies may have overestimated the circumstellar 12CO/13CO abundance
ratio. The use of the HCN as a tracer of C isotope ratios is affected by fewer complicating problems,
provided one accounts corrections for high optical depths.
