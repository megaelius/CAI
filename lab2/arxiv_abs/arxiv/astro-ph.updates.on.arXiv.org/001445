We use ZENS data at low redshift to study the dependence of the quenched satellite fraction and of
the morphological mix of these quenched satellites, on three different environmental parameters:
group halo mass, halo-centric distance and large-scale structure over-density. The fraction
of quenched satellites is independent of halo mass and the surrounding large-scale overdensity,
but increases towards the centres of the haloes, as previously found. The morphological mix is,
however, constant with radial position, indicating that the well-known morphology-density relation
results from the increasing fraction of quenched galaxies towards the centres of haloes. The constancy
of the morphological outcome suggests that mass-quenching and satellite quenching have the same
effect on the morphologies of the galaxies. The quenched satellites have larger B/T and smaller
half-light radii than the star-forming satellites. These are mostly due to differences in the disks.
The bulges in quenched satellites have very similar luminosities and surface brightness profiles,
and any mass growth of the bulges associated with quenching cannot greatly change these quantities.
The quenched disks are fainter and have smaller scale lengths than in star-forming satellites.
This can be explained either by a differential fading of the disks or if disks were generally smaller
in the past, both of which are expected in an inside-out growth of disks. At least at low redshifts,
the structure of massive quenched satellites is produced by processes that operate before quenching
takes place. A comparison with semi-analytic models argues for a reduction in the efficiency of
group halos in quenching their disk satellites and for mechanisms to increase the B/T of low mass
quenched satellites. [abridged]
