Recently an essential progress in development of physical models for cosmic ray induced ionization
in the atmosphere is achieved. Basically, the models are full target, i.e. based on Monte Carlo simulation
of an electromagnetic-muon-nucleon cascade in the atmosphere. In general, the contribution of
proton nuclei in those models is highlighted, i.e. primary cosmic ray $\alpha$-particles and heavy
nuclei are neglected or scaled to protons. The development of cosmic ray induced atmospheric cascade
is sensitive to the energy and mass of the primary cosmic ray particle. The largest uncertainties
in Monte Carlo simulations of a cascade in the Earth atmosphere are due to assumed hadron interaction
models, the so-called hadron generators. In the work presented here we compare the ionization yield
functions $Y$ for primary cosmic ray nuclei, such as protons, $\alpha$-particles, Oxygen and Iron
nuclei, assuming different hadron interaction models. The computations are fulfilled with the
CORSIKA 6.9 code using GHEISHA 2002, FLUKA 2011, UrQMD hadron generators for energy below 80 GeV/nucleon
and QGSJET II for energy above 80 GeV/nucleon. The observed difference between hadron generators
is widely discussed. The influence of different atmospheric parametrizations, namely US standard
atmosphere, US standard atmosphere winter and summer profiles on ion production rate is studied.
Assuming realistic primary cosmic ray mass composition, the ion production rate is obtained at
several rigidity cut-offs - from 1 GV (high latitudes) to 15 GV (equatorial latitudes) using various
hadron generators. The computations are compared with experimental data. A conclusion concerning
the consistency of the hadron generators is stated.
