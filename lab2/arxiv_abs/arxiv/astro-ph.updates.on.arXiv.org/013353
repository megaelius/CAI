While exoplanets are now routinely detected, the detection of small bodies in extrasolar systems
remains challenging. Since the discovery of sporadic events interpreted as exocomets (Falling
Evaporating Bodies) around $\beta$ Pic in the early 80s, only $\sim$20 stars have been reported
to host exocomet-like events. We aim to expand the sample of known exocomet-host stars, as well as
to monitor the hot-gas environment around stars with previously known exocometary activity. We
have obtained high-resolution optical spectra of a heterogeneous sample of 117 main-sequence
stars in the spectral type range from B8 to G8. The data have been collected in 14 observing campaigns
expanding over 2 years from both hemispheres. We have analysed the Ca ii K&H and Na i D lines in order
to search for non-photospheric absorptions originated in the circumstellar environment, and
for variable events that could be caused by outgassing of exocomet-like bodies. We have detected
non-photospheric absorptions towards 50% of the sample, attributing a circumstellar origin to
half of the detections (i.e. 26% of the sample). Hot circumstellar gas is detected in the metallic
lines inspected via narrow stable absorptions, and/or variable blue-/red-shifted absorption
events. Such variable events were found in 18 stars in the Ca ii and/or Na i lines; 6 of them are reported
in the context of this work for the first time. In some cases the variations we report in the Ca ii K line
are similar to those observed in $\beta$ Pic. While we do not find a significant trend with the age
or location of the stars, we do find that the probability of finding CS gas in stars with larger vsin
i is higher. We also find a weak trend with the presence of near-infrared excess, and with anomalous
($\lambda$ Boo-like) abundances, but this would require confirmation by expanding the sample.
