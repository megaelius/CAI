A sharp cut-off in the primordial scalar power spectrum on large scales has been known to improve
the fit to the cosmic microwave background data when compared to the more standard, nearly scale
invariant power spectrum that arises in slow roll inflation. In a recent work, we had numerically
investigated the characteristics of the scalar bispectrum generated in models with kinetically
dominated initial conditions. In this work, we compare the scenario with two other competing scenarios
(viz. punctuated inflation and a model due to Starobinsky) which also suppress the scalar power
in a roughly similar fashion on large scales. We further consider two other scenarios involving
inflation of a finite duration, one wherein the scalar field begins on the inflationary attractor
and another wherein the field starts with a smaller velocity and evolves towards the attractor.
These scenarios too exhibit a sharp drop in power on large scales if the initial conditions on the
perturbations for a range of modes are imposed on super-Hubble scales as in the kinetically dominated
model. The model wherein the background field always remains on the inflationary attractor is interesting
for the reason that it permits analytical calculations of the scalar power and bispectra. We compare
the amplitudes and shapes of the scalar non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{_{\rm NL}}$ in all these
cases which lead to scalar power spectra of similar form. Interestingly, we find that, in the models
wherein the initial conditions on the perturbations are imposed on super-Hubble scales, the consistency
relation governing the scalar bispectrum is violated for the large scale modes, whereas the relation
is satisfied for all the modes in the other scenarios. These differences in the behavior of the scalar
bispectra can conceivably help us observationally discriminate between the various models which
lead to similar power spectra.
