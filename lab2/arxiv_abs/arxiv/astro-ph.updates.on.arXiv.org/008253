Coupled radiative-hydrodynamics simulations of the epoch of reionization aim to reproduce the
propagation of ionization fronts during the transition before the overlap of HII regions. Many
of these simulations use moment-based methods to track radiative transfer processes using explicit
solvers and are therefore subject to strict stability conditions regarding the speed of light,
which implies a great computational cost. It can be reduced by assuming a reduced speed of light,
and this approximation is now widely used to produce large-scale simulations of reionization.
We introduce a new method for estimating and comparing the ionization front speeds based on maps
of the reionization redshifts. We applied it to a set of cosmological simulations of the reionization
using a set of reduced speeds of light, and measured the evolution of the ionization front speeds
during the reionization process. We find that ionization fronts progress via a two-stage process,
the first stage at low velocity as the fronts emerge from high density regions and a second later stage
just before the overlap, during which front speeds increase close to the speed of light. Using a set
of small 8Mpc/h^3 simulations, we find that a minimal velocity of 0.3c is able to model these two stages
in this specific context without significant impact. Values as low as 0.05c can model the first low
velocity stage, but limit the acceleration at later times. Lower values modify the distribution
of front speeds at all times. Using larger 64Mpc/h^3 volumes that better account for distant sources,
we find that reduced speed of light has a greater impact on reionization times and front speeds in
underdense regions that are reionized at late times. The same quantities measured in dense regions
with slow fronts are less sensitive to c values.
