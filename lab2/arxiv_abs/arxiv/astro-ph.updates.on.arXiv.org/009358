Current observations are not able to directly determine the CR accelerator at the galactic centre
(GC). Here we investigate VHE hadronic radiation produced within the radiative-inefficient accretion
flow (RIAF) of Sagittarius A* (SgrA*) considering a scenario where CRs are accelerated by turbulent
magnetic reconnection. We then derive possible emission profiles constrained by the magnetic
reconnection power and produced within the accretion flow zone (the central $\sim10^{13}$ cm).
Wether this mechanism contributes to the currently observed emission of the source HESS J1745-290
near the galactic centre remains unclear, due to the limited angular resolution of current instruments.
Thus, the emission profiles derived here intend to be predictions for future observations with
improved angular resolution and differential flux sensitivity. To model the gas density, magnetic
field, and soft photon field of the accretion flow, we consider a numerical, axi-symmetric, general
relativistic (GR) magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulation together with Monte Carlo leptonic
radiative transfer calculations for which we employ the {\tt harm} and {\tt grmonty} codes. CRs
are assumed to be accelerated by turbulent magnetic reconnection and we constrain their injection
with the magnetic reconnection power of the accretion flow. The emission and absorbtion of VHE gamma-rays
are simulated with the Monte Carlo {\tt CRPropa 3} code. Within the scenario presented here, we find
that for mass accretion rates $\gtrsim 10^{-7}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, the RIAF of SgrA* is able to
produce VHE fluxes that are consistent with H.E.S.S. upper limits and potentially detectable by
the future CTA. The neutrino fluxes associated to these emission profiles are negligible compared
with the diffuse neutrino emission measured by the IceCube.
