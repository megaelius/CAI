Wolf-Rayet stars of the carbon sequence (WC stars) are an important cornerstone in the late evolution
of massive stars before their core collapse. As core-helium burning, hydrogen-free objects with
huge mass-loss, they are likely the last observable stage before collapse and thus promising progenitor
candidates for type Ib/c supernovae. Their strong mass-loss furthermore provides challenges
and constraints to the theory of radiatively driven winds. Thus, the determination of the WC star
parameters is of major importance for several astrophysical fields. With Gaia DR2, for the first
time parallaxes for a large sample of Galactic WC stars are available, removing major uncertainties
inherent to earlier studies. In this work, we re-examine the sample from Sander et al. (2012) to derive
key properties of the Galactic WC population. All quantities depending on the distance are updated,
while the underlying spectral analyses remain untouched. Contrasting earlier assumptions, our
study yields that WC stars of the same subtype can significantly vary in absolute magnitude. With
Gaia DR2, the picture of the Galactic WC population becomes more complex: We obtain luminosities
ranging from log L = 4.9 to 6.0 with one outlier having log L = 4.7. This indicates that the WC stars are
likely formed from a broader initial mass range than previously assumed. We obtain mass-loss rates
ranging between log Mdot = -5.1 and -4.1, with Mdot propto L^0.68 and a linear scaling of the modified
wind momentum with luminosity. We discuss the implications for stellar evolution, including unsolved
issues regarding the need of envelope inflation to address the WR radius problem, and the open questions
in regard to the connection of WR stars with Gamma-ray bursts. WC and WO stars are progenitors of massive
black holes, collapsing either silently or in a supernova that most-likely has to be preceded by
a WO stage.
