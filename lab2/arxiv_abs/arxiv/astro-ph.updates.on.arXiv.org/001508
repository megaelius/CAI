Measuring the stellar position angle provides valuable information on binary stellar formation
or stellar spin axis evolution. We aim to develop a method for determining the absolute stellar position
angle using spectro-astrometric analysis of high resolution long-slit spectra. The method has
been designed in particular for slowly rotating stars. We investigate its applicability to existing
dispersive long-slit spectrographs, identified here by their plate scale, and the size of the resulting
stellar sample. The stellar rotation induces a tilt in the stellar lines whose angle depends on the
stellar position angle and the orientation of the slit. We developed a rotation model to calculate
and reproduce the effects of stellar rotation on unreduced high resolution stellar spectra. Then
we retrieved the tilt amplitude using a spectro-astrometric extraction of the position of the photocentre
of the spectrum. Finally we present two methods for analysing the position spectrum using either
direct measurement of the tilt or a cross-correlation analysis. For stars with large apparent diameter
and using a spectrograph with a small plate scale, we show that it is possible to determine the stellar
position angle directly within 10deg with a signal-to-noise ratio of the order of 6. Under less favourable
conditions, i.e. larger plate scale or smaller stellar diameter, the cross-correlation method
yields comparable results. We show that with the currently existing instruments, it is possible
to determine the stellar position angle of at least 50 stars precisely, mostly K-type giants with
apparent diameter down to 5 milliarcseconds. If we consider errors of around 10deg still acceptable,
we may include stars with apparent diameter down to 2 mas in the sample that then comprises also some
main sequence stars.
