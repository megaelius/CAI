We study synergies between three promising methods to measure $2<z<5$ large-scale structure in
the next decade. Optical spectroscopic surveys are the most mature, but become increasingly difficult
at $z>2$ and suffer from interloper problems even for spectroscopic surveys. Intensity mapping
of the 21-cm signal can cover large volumes with exquisite fidelity, but is limited both by loss of
information to foreground cleaning and by lack of knowledge of the mean signal. Cosmic microwave
background (CMB) lensing is theoretically very clean, but ultimately measures just the projected
variations in density. We find that cross-correlation between optical and radio can significantly
improve the measurement of growth rate. Combining these with the CMB provides a promising avenue
to detecting modified gravity at high redshifts, in particular by independently probing the Weyl
and Newtonian potentials and by strengthening control of systematics. Assuming a Stage 4 CMB-survey,
we find that cross-correlating a Stage {\sc ii} 21-cm survey with DESI quasars could enable measurements
of the growth rate $f\sigma_8$ and the gravitational slip $\gamma$ at sub 3\% and sub 8\% levels at
$z = 3, 4$, representing a factor of 4 and 8 improvement over constraints obtainable from DESI quasars
alone. Similarly, cross-correlating 21-cm data with a LBG survey to $m_{UV}<24.5$ over 1000 square
degrees will make possible $f\sigma_8$ and $\gamma$ measurements at close to 1\% at $z = 3$ and 3\%
at $z = 4$, and improve similar constraints at $z = 5$ by close to a factor of 3 to sub-10\% precision,
enabling us to test the predictions of general relativity at large scales.
