Context. Recent observations of the Bulge, e.g., its X-shape, cylindrical stellar motions, and
a potential fraction of young stars propose that it formed through secular evolution of the disk
and not through gas dissipation and/or mergers, as thought previously. Aims. We measure abundances
of six iron-peak elements (Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Co and Ni) in the local thin and thick disks as well as the Bulge
to provide additional observational constraints for Galaxy formation and chemical evolution
models. Methods. We use high-resolution optical spectra of 291 K giants in the local disk mostly
obtained by the FIES at NOT (signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 80-100) and 45 K giants in the Bulge obtained
by the UVES/FLAMES at VLT (S/N ratio of 10-80). We measure abundances in SME and apply NLTE corrections
to the [Mn/Fe] and [Co/Fe] ratios. To discriminate between the thin and thick, we use stellar metallicity,
[Ti/Fe]-ratios, and kinematics from Gaia DR2 (proper motions and the radial velocities). Results.
The observed disk trend of V is more enhanced in the thick disk, while the Co disk trend shows a minor
enhancement in the thick disk. The Bulge trends of V and Co appear even more enhanced w.r.t. the thick
disk, but within the uncertainties. The [Ni/Fe] ratio seems slightly overabundant in the thick
disk and the Bulge w.r.t. the thin disk, although the difference is minor. The disk and Bulge trends
of Sc, Cr and Mn overlap strongly. Conclusions. The somewhat enhanced [(V,Co)/Fe] ratios observed
in the Bulge suggest that the local thick disk and the Bulge might have experienced different chemical
enrichment and evolutionary paths. However, we are unable to predict the exact evolutionary path
of the Bulge solely based on these observations. Galactic chemical evolution models could, on the
other hand, provide that using these results.
