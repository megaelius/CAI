We present a formalism for computing time-dependent fluctuations in the cosmological photoionizing
radiation background, extending background fluctuations models beyond the steady-state approximation.
We apply this formalism to estimate fluctuations in the HI LyA flux redshift space power spectrum
and its spatial correlation function at redshifts 2<z<4, assuming the photoionization background
is dominated by Quasi-stellar Objects (QSOs) and/or galaxies. We show the shot noise in the power
spectrum due to discrete sources is strongly suppressed relative to the steady-state value at low
wavenumbers by a factor proportional to the lifetime of the sources, and that this suppression may
be used to constrain QSO lifetimes. The total HI LyA power spectrum including shot noise is affected
at tens of percent on short scales, and by as much as an order of magnitude or more on scales exceeding
the mean free path. The spatial correlation function is similarly found to be sensitive to the shot
noise, although moderately insensitive to the effects of time-dependence on the non-shotnoise
contribution. Photoionization rate fluctuations substantially modify the shape of the Baryonic
Acoustic Oscillation peak in the correlation function, including a small increase in its position
that must be accounted for to avoid biasing estimates of cosmological parameters based on the peak
position. We briefly investigate solving the full frequency dependent equation, finding that
it agrees with the frequency-independent to better than percent accuracy. Simple formulas are
provided for the power spectrum of fluctuations in the photoionization rate that approximate the
full computations.
