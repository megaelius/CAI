We propose to achieve the proof-of-principle of the PTOLEMY project to directly detect the Cosmic
Neutrino Background (CNB). Each of the technological challenges described in [1,2] will be targeted
and hopefully solved by the use of the latest experimental developments and profiting from the low
background environment provided by the LNGS underground site. The first phase will focus on the
graphene technology for a tritium target and the demonstration of TES microcalorimetry with an
energy resolution of better than 0.05 eV for low energy electrons. These technologies will be evaluated
using the PTOLEMY prototype, proposed for underground installation, using precision HV controls
to step down the kinematic energy of endpoint electrons to match the calorimeter dynamic range and
rate capabilities. The second phase will produce a novel implementation of the EM filter that is
scalable to the full target size and which demonstrates intrinsic triggering capability for selecting
endpoint electrons. Concurrent with the CNB program, we plan to exploit and develop the unique properties
of graphene to implement an intermediate program for direct directional detection of MeV dark matter
[3,4]. This program will evaluate the radio-purity and scalability of the graphene fabrication
process with the goal of using recently identified ultra-high radio-purity CO2 sources. The direct
detection of the CNB is a snapshot of early universe dynamics recorded by the thermal relic neutrino
yield taken at a time that predates the epochs of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the Cosmic Microwave
Background and the recession of galaxies (Hubble Expansion). Big Bang neutrinos are believed to
have a central role in the evolution of the Universe and a direct measurement with PTOLEMY will unequivocally
establish the extent to which these predictions match present-day neutrino densities.
