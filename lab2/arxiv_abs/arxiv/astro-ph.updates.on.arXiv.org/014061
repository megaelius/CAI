The infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of main-sequence galaxies in the early universe
(z > 4) is currently unconstrained as infrared continuum observations are time consuming and not
feasible for large samples. We present Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) Band 8 observations
of four main-sequence galaxies at z ~ 5.5 to study their infrared SED shape in detail. Our continuum
data (rest-frame 110$\rm \mu m$, close to the peak of infrared emission) allows us to constrain luminosity
weighted dust temperatures and total infrared luminosities. With data at longer wavelengths,
we measure for the first time the emissivity index at these redshifts to provide more robust estimates
of molecular gas masses based on dust continuum. The Band 8 observations of three out of four galaxies
can only be reconciled with optically thin emission redward of rest-frame 100$\rm \mu m$. The derived
dust peak temperatures at z ~ 5.5 (38$\pm$8K) are elevated compared to average local galaxies, however,
5-10K below what would be predicted from an extrapolation of the trend at $z<4$. This behaviour can
be explained by decreasing dust abundance (or density) towards high redshifts, which would cause
the infrared SED at the peak to be more optically thin, making hot dust more visible to the external
observer. From the 850$\rm \mu m$ dust continuum, we derive molecular gas masses between $10^{10}$
and $10^{11}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and gas fractions (gas over total mass) of 30-80% (gas depletion
times of 100-220Myrs). All in all, our results provide a first measured benchmark SED to interpret
future millimetre observations of normal, main-sequence galaxies in the early Universe.
