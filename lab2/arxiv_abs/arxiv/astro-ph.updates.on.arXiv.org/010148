We trace the cosmological origin of satellites around a dwarf galaxy using a very high resolution
(12~pc/h) cosmological hydrodynamic zoom simulation. To realistically describe the formation
and evolution of small-mass stellar satellites, our model includes a full baryonic physics treatment
including a recipe for UV self-shielding. We find that the mini-halos form objects resembling dwarf
galaxies. Despite our high resolution, none of our 'mini-halos' form objects that might be considered
globular cluster-like. Instead such objects are formed in the host galaxy's gaseous disk. We investigate
why some form stars more efficiently than others. We find that the majority of their star forming
gas is accreted after reionisation, thus the survival of a mini-halo's gas to reionisation is not
an important factor. Instead, the key factor seems to be the ability for a mini-halo to cool its recently
accreted gas, which is more efficient in more massive halos. We find halos in denser environments
suffer more mergers, enabling them to grow their mass such that cooling of accreted gas can occur
efficiently. Although the host galaxy is only a dwarf galaxy itself, we find that ram pressure is
an efficient means by which accreted mini-halos lose their gas content, both by interacting with
hot halo gas but also in direct collisions with the gas disk of the host. The satellites are also disrupted
by the tidal forces near the center of the host galaxy. Compared to the disrupted satellites, surviving
satellites are relatively more massive, but tend to infall later into the host galaxy, thus reducing
the time they are subjected to destructive environmental mechanisms and dynamical friction. In
summary, our results suggest that the characteristics of satellites are mainly determined by their
ability to efficiently cool gas that is accreted in the redshift range z=3-5, prior to their infall
into the host galaxy.
