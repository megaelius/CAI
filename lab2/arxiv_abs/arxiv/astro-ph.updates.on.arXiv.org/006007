We analyze the relationship between the flare X-ray peak flux, and characteristics of the Polarity
Inversion Line (PIL) and Active Regions (AR), derived from line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms.
The PIL detection algorithm based on a magnetogram segmentation procedure is applied for each AR
with 1 hour cadence. The PIL and AR characteristics are associated with the AR flare history and divided
into flaring and non-flaring cases. Effectiveness of the derived characteristics for flare forecasting
is determined by the number of non-flaring cases separated from flaring cases by a certain threshold,
and by their Fisher ranking score. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained only on the
PIL characteristics is used for the flare prediction. We have obtained the following results: (1)
the PIL characteristics are more effective than global characteristics of ARs, (2) the highest
True Skill Statistics (TSS) values of 0.76$\pm$0.03 for $\geq$M1.0 flares and 0.84$\pm$0.07 for
$\geq$X1.0 flares are obtained using the "Sigmoid" SVM kernel, (3) the TSS scores obtained using
only the LOS magnetograms are slightly lower than the scores obtained using vector magnetograms,
but significantly better than current expert-based predictions, (4) for prediction of $\geq$M1.0
class flares 74.4 % of all cases, and 91.2 % for $\geq$X1.0 class, can be pre-classified as negative
with no significant effect on the results, (5) the inclusion of global AR characteristics does not
improve the forecast. The study confirms the unique role of the PIL region characteristics in the
flare initiation process, and demonstrate possibilities of flare forecasting using only the line-of-sight
magnetograms.
