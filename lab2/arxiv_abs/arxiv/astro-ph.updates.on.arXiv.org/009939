Context. The interaction between low-mass companions and the debris discs they reside in is still
not fully understood. A debris disc can evolve due to self-stirring, a process in which planetesimals
can excite their neighbours to the point of destructive collisions. In addition, the presence of
a companion could further stir the disc (companion-stirring). Additional information is necessary
to understand this fundamental step in the formation and evolution of a planetary system, and at
the moment of writing only a handful of systems are known where a companion and a debris disc have both
been detected and studied at the same time. Aims. Our primary goal is to augment the sample of these
systems and to understand the relative importance between self-stirring and companion-stirring.
Methods. In the course of the VLT/NaCo Imaging Survey for Planets around Young stars (ISPY), we observed
HD 193571, an A0 debris disc hosting star at a distance of 68 pc with an age between 60 and 170 Myr. We
obtained two sets of observations in L' band and a third epoch in H band using the GPI instrument at
Gemini-South. Results. A companion was detected in all three epochs at a projected separation of
11 au (0.17 arcsec), and co-motion was confirmed through proper motion analysis. Given the inferred
disc size of 120 au, the companion appears to reside within the gap between the host star and the disc.
Comparison between the L' and H band magnitude and evolutionary tracks suggests a mass of 0.31 - 0.39
solar masses . Conclusions. We discovered a previously unknown M-dwarf companion around HD 193571,
making it the third low-mass stellar object discovered within a debris disc. A comparison to self-
and companion-stirring models suggests that the companion is likely responsible for the stirring
of the disc.
