New and unique science opportunities in several different fields of astrophysics are offered by
conducting spectroscopic studies of the Universe in the ultraviolet (UV), a wavelength regime
that is not accessible from the ground. We present some of the scientific challenges that can be addressed
with a space-based mission in 2035 - 2050. (1) By detecting the intergalactic medium in emission
it will be possible to unveil the cosmic web, whose existence is predicted by current theories of
structure formation, but it has not been probed yet. (2) Observations of the neutral gas distribution
(by mapping the Lyman-alpha emission) in low-redshift galaxy cluster members will clarify the
efficiency with which ram-pressure stripping removes the gas from galaxies and the role of the environment
in quenching star formation. (3) By observing statistical samples of supernovae in the UV it will
be possible to characterize the progenitor population of core-collapse supernovae, providing
the initial conditions for any forward-modeling simulation and allowing the community to progress
in the understanding of the explosion mechanism of stars and the final stages of stellar evolution.
(4) Targeting populations of accreting white dwarfs in globular clusters it will be possible to
constrain the evolution and fate of these stars and investigate the properties of the most compact
systems with the shortest orbital periods which are expected to be the brightest low frequency gravitational
wave sources. A UV-optimized telescope (wavelength range ~ 90 - 350 nm), equipped with a panoramic
integral field spectrograph with a large field of view (FoV ~ 1 x 1 arcmin^2), with medium spectral
(R = 4000) and spatial (~ 1" - 3") resolution will allow the community to simultaneously obtain spectral
and photometric information of the targets, and tackle the science questions presented in this
paper.
