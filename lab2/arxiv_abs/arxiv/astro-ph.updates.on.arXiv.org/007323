In the currently debated context of using clusters of galaxies as cosmological probes, the need
for well-defined cluster samples is critical. The XXL Survey has been specifically designed to
provide a well characterised sample of some 500 X-ray detected clusters suitable for cosmological
studies. The main goal of present article is to make public and describe the properties of the cluster
catalogue in its present state, as well as of associated catalogues as super-clusters and fossil
groups. We release a sample containing 365 clusters in total. We give the details of the follow-up
observations and explain the procedure adopted to validate the cluster spectroscopic redshifts.
Considering the whole XXL cluster sample, we have provided two types of selection, both complete
in a particular sense: one based on flux-morphology criteria, and an alternative based on the [0.5-2]
keV flux within one arcmin of the cluster centre. We have also provided X-ray temperature measurements
for 80$\%$ of the clusters having a flux larger than 9$\times$10$^{-15}$$\rm \thinspace erg \,
s^{-1} \, cm^{-2}$. Our cluster sample extends from z$\sim$0 to z$\sim$1.2, with one cluster at
z$\sim$2. Clusters were identified through a mean number of six spectroscopically confirmed cluster
members. Our updated luminosity function and luminosity-temperature relation are compatible
with our previous determinations based on the 100 brightest clusters, but show smaller uncertainties.
We also present an enlarged list of super-clusters and a sample of 18 possible fossil groups. This
intermediate publication is the last before the final release of the complete XXL cluster catalogue
when the ongoing C2 cluster spectroscopic follow-up is complete. It provides a unique inventory
of medium-mass clusters over a 50~\dd\ area out to z$\sim$1.
