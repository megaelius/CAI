A new estimation of the total number and energy of the non-thermal electrons produced in the giant
($>\text{X}17$) solar flare on 2003 October 28 is presented based on the analysis of the observations
of the hard X-ray (HXR) emission by the High Energy Neutron Detector (HEND) onboard the Mars Odyssey
spacecraft orbiting Mars. Previous estimations of the non-thermal electron energy based on the
Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) data were incomplete since RHESSI
missed the peak of the flare impulsive phase. In contrast, HEND observed the whole flare. We used
two models to estimate the energy of the non-thermal electrons: the cold thick target model and the
warm thick target model. We found that, depending on the model used and the low-energy cutoff ($E_\mathrm{c}$)
of the non-thermal electrons, the estimate of their total energy in the entire flare can vary from
$2.3 \times 10^{32}$ to $6.2 \times 10^{33}$ ergs. The lowest estimate, $2.3 \times 10^{32}$ ergs,
obtained within the cold thick target model and fixed $E_\mathrm{c}=43$ keV, is consistent with
the previous estimate. In this case, non-thermal electrons accelerated in the peak of the flare
impulsive phase missed by RHESSI contained approximately $40\%$ of the total energy of non-thermal
electrons of the entire flare. The highest value, $6.2 \times 10^{33}$ ergs, obtained with the cold
thick target model and fixed $E_\mathrm{c}=10$ keV, looks abnormally high, since it exceeds the
total non-potential magnetic energy of the parent active region and the total bolometric energy
radiated in the flare. Our estimates also show that the total number and energetics of the HXR-producing
electrons in the flare region is a few orders of magnitude higher than of the population of energetic
electrons injected into interplanetary space.
