Baryonic effects are amongst the most severe systematics to the tomographic analysis of weak lensing
data which is the principal probe in many future generations of cosmological surveys like LSST,
Euclid etc.. Modeling or parameterizing these effects is essential in order to extract valuable
constraints on cosmological parameters. In a recent paper, Eifler et al. (2015) suggested a reduction
technique for baryonic effects by conducting a principal component analysis (PCA) and removing
the largest baryonic eigenmodes from the data. In this article, we conducted the investigation
further and addressed two critical aspects. Firstly, we performed the analysis by separating the
simulations into training and test sets, computing a minimal set of principle components from the
training set and examining the fits on the test set. We found that using only four parameters, corresponding
to the four largest eigenmodes of the training set, the test sets can be fitted thoroughly with an
RMS $\sim 0.0011$. Secondly, we explored the significance of outliers, the most exotic/extreme
baryonic scenarios, in this method. We found that excluding the outliers from the training set results
in a relatively bad fit and degraded the RMS by nearly a factor of 3. Therefore, for a direct employment
of this method to the tomographic analysis of the weak lensing data, the principle components should
be derived from a training set that comprises adequately exotic but reasonable models such that
the reality is included inside the parameter domain sampled by the training set. The baryonic effects
can be parameterized as the coefficients of these principle components and should be marginalized
over the cosmological parameter space.
