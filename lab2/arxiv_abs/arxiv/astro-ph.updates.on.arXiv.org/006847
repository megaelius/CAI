The wavefront sensors used today at the biggest World's telescopes have either a high dynamic range
or a high sensitivity, and they are subject to a linear trade off between these two parameters. A new
class of wavefront sensors, the Generalised Optical Differentiation Wavefront Sensors, has been
devised, in a way not to undergo this linear trade off and to decouple the dynamic range from the sensitivity.
This new class of WFSs is based on the light filtering in the focal plane from a dedicated amplitude
filter, which is a hybrid between a linear filter, whose physical dimension is related to the dynamic
range, and a step in the amplitude, whose size is related to the sensitivity. We propose here a possible
technical implementation of this kind of WFS, making use of a simple holographic diffuser to diffract
part of the light in a ring shape around the pin of a pyramid wavefront sensor. In this way, the undiffracted
light reaches the pin of the pyramid, contributing to the high sensitivity regime of the WFS, while
the diffused light is giving a sort of static modulation of the pyramid, allowing to have some signal
even in high turbulence conditions. The holographic diffuser zeroth order efficiency is strictly
related to the sensitivity of the WFS, while the diffusing angle of the diffracted light gives the
amount of modulation and thus the dynamic range. By properly choosing these two parameters it is
possible to build a WFS with high sensitivity and high dynamic range in a static fashion. Introducing
dynamic parts in the setup allows to have a set of different diffuser that can be alternated in front
of the pyramid, if the change in the seeing conditions requires it.
