Core-collapse supernovae are found in galaxies with ongoing star-formation. In a starburst galaxy
hosting an active galactic nucleus with a relativistic jet, supernovae can take place inside the
jet. The collision of the supernova ejecta with the jet flow is expected to lead to the formation of
an interaction region, in which particles can be accelerated and produce high-energy emission.
We study the non-thermal radiation produced by electrons accelerated as a result of a supernova
explosion inside the jet of an active galactic nucleus within a star-forming galaxy. We first analyzed
the dynamical evolution of the supernova ejecta impacted by the jet. Then, we explored the parameter
space using simple prescriptions for the observed gamma-ray lightcurve. Finally, the synchrotron
and the inverse Compton spectral energy distributions for two types of sources, a radio galaxy and
a powerful blazar, are computed. For a radio galaxy, the interaction between a supernova and a jet
of power $\sim 10^{43}-10^{44}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ can produce apparent gamma-ray luminosities of
$\sim 10^{42}-10^{43}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, with an event duty cycle of supernova remnant (SNR) interacting
with the jet close to one for one galaxy. For a blazar with a powerful jet of $\sim 10^{46}$~erg~s$^{-1}$,
the jet-supernova ejecta interaction could produce apparent gamma-ray luminosities of $\sim
10^{43}-10^{44}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, but with a much lower duty cycle. The interaction of supernovae
with misaligned jets of moderate power can be relatively frequent, and can result in steady gamma-ray
emission potentially detectable for sources in the local universe. For powerful blazars much farther
away, the emission would be steady as well, and it might be detectable under very efficient acceleration,
but the events would be rather infrequent.
