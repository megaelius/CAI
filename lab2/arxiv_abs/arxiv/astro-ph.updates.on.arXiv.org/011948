Context. Obscuration events caused by outflowing clumps or streams of high column density, low
ionisation gas, heavily absorbing the X-ray continuum, have been witnessed in a number of Seyfert
galaxies. Aims. We report on the X-ray spectral-timing analysis of the December 2016 obscuration
event in NGC 3783, aimed at probing variability of the X-ray obscurer on the shortest possible timescales.
The main goals of this study are to obtain independent constraints on the density, and ultimately
on the distance of the obscuring gas, as well as to characterise the impact of variable obscuration
on the observed X-ray spectral-timing characteristics of Seyfert galaxies. Methods. We carried
out a comparative analysis of NGC 3783 during unobscured (using archival 2000-2001 XMM-Newton
data) and obscured states (using XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data from the 2016 observational campaign).
The timescales analysed range between ten hours and about one hour. This study was then generalized
to discuss the signatures of variable obscuration in the X-ray spectral-timing characteristics
of Seyfert galaxies as a function of the physical properties of the obscuring gas. Results. The X-ray
obscurer in NGC 3783 is found to vary on timescales between about one hour to ten hours. This variability
is incoherent with the variations of the X-ray continuum. A fast response (on timescales shorter
than about 1.5 ks) of the ionisation state of the obscuring gas to the short timescale variability
of the primary X-ray continuum provides a satisfactory interpretation of all the observed X-ray
spectral-timing properties. This study enabled us to put independent constraints on the density
and location of the obscuring gas. We found the gas to have a density of $n_{e}> 7.1 \times 10^7 \rm{cm^{-3}}$,
consistent with being part of the broad line region.
