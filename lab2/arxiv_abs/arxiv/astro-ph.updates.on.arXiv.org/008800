The upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will detect many strongly lensed Type Ia supernovae
(LSNe Ia) for time-delay cosmography. This will provide an independent and direct way for measuring
the Hubble constant $H_0$, which is necessary to address the current $3.6 \sigma$ tension in $H_0$
between the local distance ladder and the early universe measurements. We present a detailed analysis
of different observing strategies for the LSST, and quantify their impact on time-delay measurement
between multiple images of LSNe Ia. For this, we simulate observations by using mock LSNe Ia for which
we produce mock-LSST light curves accounting for microlensing. To measure the time delay from the
simulated observations we use the free-knot splines estimator from the software PyCS. We find that
using only LSST data for time-delay cosmography is not ideal. Instead, we advocate using LSST as
a discovery machine for LSNe Ia, enabling time delay measurements from follow-up observations
from other instruments in order to increase the number of systems by a factor of 2 to 16 depending on
the observing strategy. Further, we find that LSST observing strategies which provide a good sampling
frequency (mean inter-night gap around 2 days) and high cumulative season length (10 seasons with
season length around 170 days) are favored. Rolling cadences subdivide the survey and focus on different
parts in different years; these observing strategies trade number of seasons for better sampling
frequency, which leads in our investigation to half the number of systems in comparison to the best
observing strategy and therefore rolling cadences are disfavored. We anticipate that the sample
of lensed SNe Ia from our preferred LSST cadence strategies with rapid follow-up observations would
yield an independent percent-level constraint on $H_0$.
