The High Cadence Transient Survey (HiTS) aims to discover and study transient objects with characteristic
timescales between hours and days, such as pulsating, eclipsing and exploding stars. This survey
represents a unique laboratory to explore large etendue observations from cadences of about 0.1
days and to test new computational tools for the analysis of large data. This work follows a fully
\textit{Data Science} approach: from the raw data to the analysis and classification of variable
sources. We compile a catalog of ${\sim}15$ million object detections and a catalog of ${\sim}2.5$
million light-curves classified by variability. The typical depth of the survey is $24.2$, $24.3$,
$24.1$ and $23.8$ in $u$, $g$, $r$ and $i$ bands, respectively. We classified all point-like non-moving
sources by first extracting features from their light-curves and then applying a Random Forest
classifier. For the classification, we used a training set constructed using a combination of cross-matched
catalogs, visual inspection, transfer/active learning and data augmentation. The classification
model consists of several Random Forest classifiers organized in a hierarchical scheme. The classifier
accuracy estimated on a test set is approximately $97\%$. In the unlabeled data, $3\,485$ sources
were classified as variables, of which $1\,321$ were classified as periodic. Among the periodic
classes we discovered with high confidence, 1 $\delta$-scutti, 39 eclipsing binaries, 48 rotational
variables and 90 RR-Lyrae and for the non-periodic classes we discovered 1 cataclysmic variables,
630 QSO, and 1 supernova candidates. The first data release can be accessed in the project archive
of HiTS.
