The asymmetric gravity field measured by the Juno spacecraft allowed estimation of the depth of
Jupiter's zonal jets, showing that the winds extend approximately $3000$ km beneath the cloud-level.
This estimate was based on an analysis using a combination of all measured odd gravity harmonics
$J_{3}$, $J_{5}$, $J_{7}$, and $J_{9}$, but the wind profile dependence on each of them separately
has not been investigated. Furthermore, these calculations assumed the meridional profile of
the cloud-level wind extends to depth. However, it is possible that the interior jet profile varies
from that of the cloud-level as hinted by the Juno microwave measurement that find a smoother nadir
brightness temperature profile at depth compared to the cloud-level. Here we analyze in detail
the possible meridional and vertical structure of Jupiter's deep jet-streams. We find that each
odd gravity harmonic constrains the flow at a different depth, with $J_{3}$ being the most dominant
at depths below $3000$ km, $J_{5}$ being the most restrictive overall, and $J_{9}$ not constraining
the flow at all if the other odd harmonics are within the measurement range. Interior flow profiles
constructed from perturbations to the cloud-level winds allow a more extensive range of vertical
wind profiles, yet when the profiles differ substantially from the cloud-level, the ability to
match the gravity data reduces significantly. Overall, we find that while interior wind profiles
that do not resemble the cloud-level are possible, they are statistically unlikely. However, slightly
smoother profiles, which resemble the Juno's microwave radiometer temperature profile at depth,
are still compatible with the gravity measurements.
