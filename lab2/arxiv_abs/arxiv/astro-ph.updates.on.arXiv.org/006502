Absolute parameters of 509 main-sequence stars selected from the components of detached-eclipsing
spectroscopic binaries in the Solar neighbourhood are used to study mass-luminosity, mass-radius
and mass-effective temperature relations (MLR, MRR and MTR). The MLR function is found better if
expressed by a six-piece classical MLR ($L \propto M^{\alpha}$) rather than a fifth or a sixth degree
polynomial within the mass range of $0.179\leq M/M_{\odot}\leq 31$. The break points separating
the mass-ranges with classical MLR do not appear to us to be arbitrary. Instead, the data indicate
abrupt changes along the mass axis in the mean energy generation per unit of stellar mass. Unlike
the MLR function, the MRR and MTR functions cannot be determined over the full range of masses. A single
piece MRR function is calibrated from the radii of stars with $M\leq1.5M_{\odot}$, while a second
single piece MTR function is found for stars with $M>1.5M_{\odot}$. The missing part of the MRR is
computed from the MLR and MTR, while the missing part of the MTR is computed from the MLR and MRR. As
a result, we have interrelated MLR, MRR and MTR, which are useful in determining the typical absolute
physical parameters of main-sequence stars of given masses. These functions are also useful to
estimate typical absolute physical parameters from typical $T_{eff}$ values. Thus, we were able
to estimate the typical absolute physical parameters of main-sequence stars observed in the Sejong
Open Cluster survey, based on that survey's published values for $T_{eff}$. Since typical absolute
physical parameters of main sequence stars cannot normally be determined in such photometric surveys,
the interrelated functions are shown to be useful to compute such missing parameters from similar
surveys.
