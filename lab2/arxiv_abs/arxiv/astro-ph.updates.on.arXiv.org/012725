The TOV equation appears as the relativistic counterpart of the classical condition for hydrostatic
equilibrium. In the present work we aim at showing that a generalised TOV equation also characterises
the equilibrium of models endowed with other symmetries besides spherical. We apply the dual null
formalism to spacetimes with two dimensional spherical, planar and hyperbolic symmetries with
a perfect fluid as the source. We also assume a Killing vector field orthogonal to the surfaces of
symmetry, which gives us static solutions, in the timelike Killing field case, and homogeneous
dynamical solutions in the case the Killing field is spacelike. In order to treat equally all the
aforementioned cases, we discuss the definition of a quasi-local energy for the spacetimes with
planar and hyperbolic foliations, since the Hawking-Hayward definition only applies to compact
foliations. After this procedure, we are able to translate our geometrical formalism to the fluid
dynamics language in a unified way, to find the generalized TOV equation, for the three cases when
the solution is static, and to obtain the evolution equation, for the homogeneous spacetime cases.
Remarkably, we show that the static solutions which are not spherically symmetric violate the weak
energy condition (WEC). We have also shown that the counterpart of the TOV equation for the spatially
homogeneous models is just the familiar equation \r{ho} + P = 0, defining a cosmological constant-type
behaviour, both in the hyperbolic and spherical cases. This implies a violation of the strong energy
condition in both cases, added to the above mentioned violation of the weak energy condition in the
hyperbolic case. We illustrate our unified treatment obtaining analogs of Schwarzschild interior
solution, for an incompressible fluid $\rho = \rho_0$ constant.
