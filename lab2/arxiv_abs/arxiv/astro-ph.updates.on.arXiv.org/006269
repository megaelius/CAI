Stellar kinematics provide insights into the masses and formation histories of galaxies. At high
redshifts, spatially resolving the stellar kinematics of quiescent galaxies is challenging due
to their compact sizes. Using deep near-infrared spectroscopy, we have measured the resolved stellar
kinematics of four quiescent galaxies at z=1.95-2.64, introduced in Paper I, that are gravitationally
lensed by galaxy clusters. Analyses of two of these have previously been reported individually
by Newman et al. and Toft et al., and for the latter we present new observations. All four galaxies
show significant rotation and can be classified as "fast rotators." In the three systems for which
the lensing constraints permit a reconstruction of the source, we find that all are likely to be highly
flattened (intrinsic ellipticities of $\approx0.75-0.85$) disk-dominated galaxies with rapid
rotation speeds of $V_{\rm max}=290-352$ km/s and predominantly rotational support, as indicated
by the ratio $(V/\sigma)_{R_e}=1.7-2.3$. Compared to coeval star-forming galaxies of similar
mass, the quiescent galaxies have smaller $V/\sigma$. Given their high masses $M_{\rm dyn} \gtrsim
2\times10^{11} M_{\odot}$, we argue that these galaxies are likely to evolve into "slow rotator"
elliptical galaxies whose specific angular momentum is reduced by a factor of 5-10. This provides
strong evidence for merger-driven evolution of massive galaxies after quenching. Consistent
with indirect evidence from earlier morphological studies, our small but unique sample suggests
that the kinematic transformations that produced round, dispersion-supported elliptical galaxies
were not generally coincident with quenching. Such galaxies probably emerged later via mergers
that increased their masses and sizes while also eroding their rotational support.
