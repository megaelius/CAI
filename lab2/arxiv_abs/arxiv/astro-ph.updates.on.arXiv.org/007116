We present a survey of far-ultraviolet (FUV; 1150 - 1450 Ang) emission line spectra from 71 planet-hosting
and 33 non-planet-hosting F, G, K, and M dwarfs with the goals of characterizing their range of FUV
activity levels, calibrating the FUV activity level to the 90 - 360 Ang extreme-ultraviolet (EUV)
stellar flux, and investigating the potential for FUV emission lines to probe star-planet interactions
(SPIs). We build this emission line sample from a combination of new and archival observations with
the Hubble Space Telescope-COS and -STIS instruments, targeting the chromospheric and transition
region emission lines of Si III, N V, C II, and Si IV. We find that the exoplanet host stars, on average,
display factors of 5 - 10 lower UV activity levels compared with the non-planet hosting sample; this
is explained by a combination of observational and astrophysical biases in the selection of stars
for radial-velocity planet searches. We demonstrate that UV activity-rotation relation in the
full F - M star sample is characterized by a power-law decline (with index $\alpha$ ~ -1.1), starting
at rotation periods >~3.5 days. Using N V or Si IV spectra and a knowledge of the star's bolometric
flux, we present a new analytic relationship to estimate the intrinsic stellar EUV irradiance in
the 90 - 360 Ang band with an accuracy of roughly a factor of ~2. Finally, we study the correlation between
SPI strength and UV activity in the context of a principal component analysis that controls for the
sample biases. We find that SPIs are not a statistically significant contributor to the observed
UV activity levels.
