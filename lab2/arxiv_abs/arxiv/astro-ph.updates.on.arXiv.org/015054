Planetary spatial data returned by spacecraft, including images and higher-order products such
as mosaics, controlled basemaps, and digital elevation models (DEMs), are of critical importance
to NASA, its commercial partners and other space agencies. Planetary spatial data are an essential
component of basic scientific research and sustained planetary exploration and operations. The
Planetary Data System (PDS) is performing the essential job of archiving and serving these data,
mostly in raw or calibrated form, with less support for higher-order, more ready-to-use products.
However, many planetary spatial data remain not readily accessible to and/or usable by the general
science user because particular skills and tools are necessary to process and interpret them from
the raw initial state. There is a critical need for planetary spatial data to be more accessible and
usable to researchers and stakeholders. A Planetary Spatial Data Infrastructure (PSDI) is a collection
of data, tools, standards, policies, and the people that use and engage with them. A PSDI comprises
an overarching support system for planetary spatial data. PSDIs (1) establish effective plans
for data acquisition; (2) create and make available higher-order products; and (3) consider long-term
planning for correct data acquisition, processing and serving (including funding). We recommend
that Planetary Spatial Data Infrastructures be created for all bodies and key regions in the Solar
System. NASA, with guidance from the planetary science community, should follow established data
format standards to build foundational and framework products and use those to build and apply PDSIs
to all bodies. Establishment of PSDIs is critical in the coming decade for several locations under
active or imminent exploration, and for all others for future planning and current scientific analysis.
