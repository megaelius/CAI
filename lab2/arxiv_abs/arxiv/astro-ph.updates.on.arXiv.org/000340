We study the three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamics of the post-core-bounce phase of the collapse
of a 27-solar-mass star and pay special attention to the development of the standing accretion shock
instability (SASI) and neutrino-driven convection. To this end, we perform 3D general-relativistic
simulations with a 3-species neutrino leakage scheme. The leakage scheme captures the essential
aspects of neutrino cooling, heating, and lepton number exchange as predicted by radiation-hydrodynamics
simulations. The 27-solar-mass progenitor was studied in 2D by B. Mueller et al. (ApJ 761:72, 2012),
who observed strong growth of the SASI while neutrino-driven convection was suppressed. In our
3D simulations, neutrino-driven convection grows from numerical perturbations imposed by our
Cartesian grid. It becomes the dominant instability and leads to large-scale non-oscillatory
deformations of the shock front. These will result in strongly aspherical explosions without the
need for large-scale SASI shock oscillations. Low-l-mode SASI oscillations are present in our
models, but saturate at small amplitudes that decrease with increasing neutrino heating and vigor
of convection. Our results, in agreement with simpler 3D Newtonian simulations, suggest that once
neutrino-driven convection is started, it is likely to become the dominant instability in 3D. Whether
it is the primary instability after bounce will ultimately depend on the physical seed perturbations
present in the cores of massive stars. The gravitational wave signal, which we extract and analyze
for the first time from 3D general-relativistic models, will serve as an observational probe of
the postbounce dynamics and, in combination with neutrinos, may allow us to determine the primary
hydrodynamic instability.
