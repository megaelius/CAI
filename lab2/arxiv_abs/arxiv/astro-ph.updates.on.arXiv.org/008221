We confirm that the number of globular clusters (GC) N$_{GC}$ is an excellent tracer of their host's
dark halo virial mass M$_{vir}$. The simple linear relation M$_{vir} = 5 \times 10^9$ M$_{\odot}
\times$ N$_{GC}$ fits the data perfectly from M$_{vir} = 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ to M$_{vir} = 2 \times
10^{15}$ M$_{\odot}$. This result is independent of galaxy morphology and even extends statistically
into the dwarf galaxy regime with M$_{vir} = 10^8 - 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$. As this correlation does
not depend on GC mass it is ideally suited for high-precision determinations of M$_{vir}$. The linearity
is most simply explained as a result of hierarchical cosmological merging of a high-redshift halo
seed population that hosted on average one GC per $5 \times 10^9$ M$_{\odot} \times (1- \eta_{smooth})$
of dark matter mass. Here $\eta_{smooth} \approx 0.9$ denotes the fraction of the present-day dark
halo mass that was accumulated by smooth accretion. Strong secular evolution of the GC system requires
significant fine-tuning as processes like GC disruption generate non-linear correlations that
are not observed. The cosmological merging scenario also implies a strong decline of the scatter
in $N_{GC}$ with increasing virial mass $\delta N_{GC}/N_{GC} \sim M_{vir}^{-1/2}$ in contrast
with the observations that show a roughly constant scatter, independent of virial mass. This discrepancy
can be explained if errors in determining virial masses from kinematical tracers and gravitational
lensing are of the order of a factor of 2. GCs in dwarf satellite galaxies pose a serious problem for
high-redshift GC formation scenarios. The dark halo masses of dwarf galaxies hosting GCs therefore
might have been one order of magnitude larger than currently estimated.
