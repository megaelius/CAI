Context. The solar chromosphere and the lower transition region is believed to play a crucial role
in the heating of the solar corona. Models that describe the chromosphere (and the lower transition
region), accounting for its highly dynamic and structured character are, so far, found to be lacking.
This is partly due to the breakdown of complete frequency redistribution in the chromospheric layers
and also because of the difficulty in obtaining complete sets of observations that adequately constrain
the solar atmosphere at all relevant heights. Aims. We aim to obtain semi-empirical model atmospheres
that reproduce the features of the Mg II h&k line profiles that sample the middle chromosphere with
focus on a sunspot. Methods. We use spectropolarimetric observations of the Ca II 8542 A spectra
obtained with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) and use NICOLE inversions to obtain semi-empirical
model atmospheres for different features in and around a sunspot. These are used to synthesize Mg
II h&k spectra using RH1.5D code, which we compare with observations taken with the Interface Region
Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). Results. Comparison of the synthetic profiles with IRIS observations
reveals that there are several areas, especially in the penumbra of the sunspot, where most of the
observed Mg II h&k profiles are very well reproduced. In addition, we find that supersonic hot downflows,
present in our collection of models in the umbra, lead to synthetic profiles that agree well with
the IRIS Mg II h&k profiles, with the exception of the line core. Conclusions. We put forward and make
available four semi-empirical model atmospheres. Two for the penumbra, reflecting the range of
temperatures obtained for the chromosphere, one for umbral flashes, and a model representative
of the quiet surroundings of a sunspot. These are available in electronic as well as in table formats.
