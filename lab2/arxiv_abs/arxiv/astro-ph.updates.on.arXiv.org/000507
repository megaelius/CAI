We analyze the link between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and mid-infrared flux using dust radiative
transfer calculations of starbursts realized in hydrodynamical simulations. Focusing on the
effects of galaxy dust, we evaluate diagnostics commonly used to disentangle AGN and star formation
in ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). We examine these quantities as a function of time,
viewing angle, dust model, AGN spectrum, and AGN strength in merger simulations representing two
possible extremes of the ULIRG population: one is a typical gas-rich merger at z ~ 0, and the other
is characteristic of extremely obscured starbursts at z ~ 2 to 4. This highly obscured burst begins
star-formation-dominated with significant PAH emission, and ends with a ~10^9 yr period of red
near-IR colors. At coalescence, when the AGN is most luminous, dust obscures the near-infrared
AGN signature, reduces the relative emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and
enhances the 9.7 micron absorption by silicate grains. Although generally consistent with previous
interpretations, our results imply none of these indicators can unambiguously estimate the AGN
luminosity fraction in all cases. Motivated by the simulations, we show that a combination of the
extinction feature at 9.7 micron, the PAH strength, and a near-infrared slope can simultaneously
constrain the AGN fraction and dust grain distribution for a wide range of obscuration. We find that
this indicator, accessible to the James Webb Space Telescope, may estimate the AGN power as tightly
as the hard X-ray flux alone, thereby providing a valuable future cross-check and constraint for
large samples of distant ULIRGs.
