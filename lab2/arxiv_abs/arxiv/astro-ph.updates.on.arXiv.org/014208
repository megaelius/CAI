We focus on a series of $f(R)$ gravity theories in Palatini formalism to investigate the probabilities
of producing the late-time acceleration for the flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe.
We apply statefinder diagnostic to these cosmological models for chosen series of parameters to
see if they distinguish from one another. The diagnostic involves the statefinder pair $\{r,s\}$,
where $r$ is derived from the scale factor $a$ and its higher derivatives with respect to the cosmic
time $t$, and $s$ is expressed by $r$ and the deceleration parameter $q$. In conclusion, we find that
although two types of $f(R)$ theories: (i) $f(R) = R + \alpha R^m - \beta R^{-n}$ and (ii) $f(R) = R +
\alpha \ln R - \beta$ can lead to late-time acceleration, their evolutionary trajectories in the
$r-s$ and $r-q$ planes reveal different evolutionary properties, which certainly justify the
merits of statefinder diagnostic. Additionally, we utilize the observational Hubble parameter
data (OHD) to constrain these models of $f(R)$ gravity. As a result, except for $m=n=1/2$ of (i) case,
$\alpha=0$ of (i) case and (ii) case allow $\Lambda$CDM model to exist in 1$\sigma$ confidence region.
After adopting statefinder diagnostic to the best-fit models, we find that all the best-fit models
are capable of going through deceleration/acceleration transition stage with late-time acceleration
epoch, and all these models turn to de-Sitter point ($\{r,s\}=\{1,0\}$) in the future. Also, the
evolutionary differences between these models are distinct, especially in $r-s$ plane, which
makes the statefinder diagnostic more reliable in discriminating cosmological models.
