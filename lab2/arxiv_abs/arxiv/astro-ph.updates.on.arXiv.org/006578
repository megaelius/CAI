Image persistence is a major problem in infrared detectors, potentially seriously limiting data
quality in many observational regimes. The problem manifests itself as remnant images that can
persist for several days after a deep exposure. In this study, the persistence behavior of three
5.3um cutoff H2RGs has been characterised using a low-background cryostat with LED light sources.
Persistence charge de-trapping was measured over several hours following a wide range of exposure
levels and exposure times. This data was then analysed to yield charge trapping and de-trapping
spectra which present graphically the trap density as a function of their time constants. These
spectra show the detector behavior in a very direct way and offer a natural metric for comparing different
devices. It is hoped that the trap time constant spectra for each detector can be used in an analysis
pipeline to remove persistence artifacts based on the recent exposure history of the detector.
The study confirmed that the charge traps responsible for persistence must be present in the depletion
region of the pixel, however, two trap populations were revealed. One of these captures charge within
milliseconds and then releases it over many hours. The second population is less problematic with
fairly similar trapping and de-trapping time constants. Large differences in persistence magnitude
and trap spectra have been found even between devices with near-consecutive serial numbers. Lower
temperatures resulted in lower persistence both in terms of total trapped charge and the time taken
for that charge to decay. Limiting the full-well by reducing pixel bias voltage also had a beneficial
effect. Previously proposed mitigation techniques including "global reset de-trapping" and
"night light" illumination were tried but found to be ineffective.
