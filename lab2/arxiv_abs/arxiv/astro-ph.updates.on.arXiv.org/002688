We present a multiline CS survey towards the brightest bow-shock B1 in the prototypical chemically
active protostellar outflow L1157. We made use of (sub-)mm data obtained in the framework of the
Chemical HErschel Surveys of Star forming regions (CHESS) and Astrochemical Surveys at IRAM (ASAI)
key science programs. We detected $^{12}$C$^{32}$S, $^{12}$C$^{34}$S, $^{13}$C$^{32}$S, and
$^{12}$C$^{33}$S emissions, for a total of 18 transitions, with $E_{\rm u}$ up to $\sim$ 180 K. The
unprecedented sensitivity of the survey allows us to carefully analyse the line profiles, revealing
high-velocity emission, up to 20 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the systemic. The profiles can be well
fitted by a combination of two exponential laws that are remarkably similar to what previously found
using CO. These components have been related to the cavity walls produced by the $\sim$ 2000 yr B1
shock and the older ($\sim$ 4000 yr) B2 shock, respectively. The combination of low- and high-excitation
CS emission was used to properly sample the different physical components expected in a shocked
region. Our CS observations show that this molecule is highlighting the dense, $n_{\rm H_2}$ = 1--5
$\times$ 10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$, cavity walls produced by the episodic outflow in L1157. In addition,
the highest excitation (E$_u$ $\geq$ 130 K) CS lines provide us with the signature of denser (1--5
$\times$ 10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$) gas, associated with a molecular reformation zone of a dissociative
J-type shock, which is expected to arise where the precessing jet impacting the molecular cavities.
The CS fractional abundance increases up to $\sim$ 10$^{-7}$ in all the kinematical components.
This value is consistent with what previously found for prototypical protostars and it is in agreement
with the prediction of the abundances obtained via the chemical code Astrochem.
