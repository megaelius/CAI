The gravitational waves from the first binary neutron star merger, GW170817, were accompanied
by a multi-wavelength electromagnetic counterpart, from $\gamma$-rays to radio. The accompanying
gamma-rays, seems at first to confirm the association of mergers with short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs).
The common interpretation was that we see an emission from an sGRB jet seen off-axis. However, a closer
examination of the sub-luminous $\gamma$-rays and the peculiar radio afterglow were inconsistent
with this simple interpretation. Here we present results of 3D and 2D numerical simulations that
follow the hydrodynamics and emission of the outflow from a neutron star merger form its ejection
and up to its deceleration by the circum-merger medium. Our results show that the entire set of $\gamma$-rays,
X-rays and radio observations can be explained by the emission from a mildly relativistic cocoon
material (Lorentz factor $\sim$2-5) that was formed while a jet propagated through the material
ejected during the merger. The $\gamma$-rays are generated when the cocoon breaks out from the engulfing
ejecta while the afterglow is produced by interaction of the cocoon matter with the interstellar
medium. The strong early uv/optical signal may be a Lorentz boosted macronova/kilonova. The fate
of the jet itself is currently unknown, but our full-EM models define a path to resolving between
successful and choked jet scenarios, outputting coupled predictions for the image size, morphology,
observed time-dependent polarization and light curve behavior from radio to X-ray. The predictive
power of these models will prove key in interpreting the on-going multi-faceted observations of
this unprecedented event.
