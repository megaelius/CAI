Years-long high-precision brightness measurements assembled with telescopes operating in space
have become available for thousands of stars. Such data made it possible to measure the physics of
stellar interiors via nonradial oscillations, opening a new avenue to study the stars in the Universe.
Asteroseismology, the interpretation of the characteristics of oscillation modes in terms of
the physical properties of the stellar interior, brought entirely new insights in how stars rotate
and how they build up their chemistry throughout their evolution. We discuss how data-driven space
asteroseismology has allowed us to improve our knowledge of stellar physics. This delivered a drastic
increase in the reliability of computer models mimicking the evolution of stars born with a variety
of masses and metalicities. Such models are critical ingredients for modern physics as a whole,
because they are used throughout various contemporary and multidisciplinary research fields
in space science, including the search for life outside the solar system, archeological studies
of the Milky Way, and supernova explosions of single and binary stars, among which future gravitational
wave sources. We illustrate the specific role and potential of asteroseismology for those modern
research fields. We end with current limitations of asteroseismology and highlight how they can
be overcome with ongoing and future large infrastructures for survey astronomy combined with new
theoretical research in the era of high-performance computing. This review presents some of the
results obtained thanks to major community efforts over the past decade. These breakthroughs were
achieved in a collaborative and inclusive spirit so characteristic of the asteroseismology community.
The aim was to write it in a way so as to make this research field well accessible.
