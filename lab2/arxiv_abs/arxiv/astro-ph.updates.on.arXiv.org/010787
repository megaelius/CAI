The detection of gravitational waves and neutrinos from astrophysical sources with gamma-ray
counterparts officially started the era of Multi-Messenger Astronomy. Their transient and extreme
nature implies that monitoring the VHE sky is fundamental to investigate the non-electromagnetic
signals. However, the limited effective area of space-borne instruments prevents observations
above a few hundred GeV, while the small field of view and low duty cycle of IACTs make them unsuited
for extensive monitoring activities and prompt response to transients. Extensive Air Shower arrays
(EAS) can provide a large field of view, a wide effective area and a very high duty cycle. Their main
difficulty is the distinction between gamma-ray and cosmic-ray initiated air showers, especially
below the TeV range. Here we present some case studies stressing the importance that a new EAS array
in the Southern Hemisphere will be able to survey the sky from below 100 GeV up to several TeV. In the
energy domain between 100 and 400 GeV we expect the strongest electromagnetic signatures of the
acceleration of ultra-relativistic particles in sources like SNRs, blazar jets and gamma-ray
bursts, as recently proved by IACT observations. This spectral window is also crucial to understand
the Universe opacity to high energy radiation, thus providing constraints on the cosmological
parameters. We will discuss the implications of VHE radiation on the mechanisms at work and we will
focus on the advantages resulting from the ability to monitor the energy window lying between the
domain of space-borne detectors and ground-based facilities.
