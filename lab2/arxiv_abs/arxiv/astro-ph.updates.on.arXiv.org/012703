Exoplanet emission spectra are often modelled assuming that the hemisphere observed is well represented
by a horizontally homogenised atmosphere. However this approximation will likely fail for planets
with a large temperature contrast in the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) era, potentially leading
to erroneous interpretations of spectra. We first develop an analytic formulation to quantify
the signal-to-noise ratio and wavelength coverage necessary to disentangle temperature inhomogeneities
from a hemispherically averaged spectrum. We find that for a given signal-to-noise ratio, observations
at shorter wavelengths are better at detecting the presence of inhomogeneities. We then determine
why the presence of an inhomogeneous thermal structure can lead to spurious molecular detections
when assuming a fully homogenised planet in the retrieval process. Finally, we quantify more precisely
the potential biases by modelling a suite of hot Jupiter spectra, varying the spatial contributions
of a hot and a cold region, as would be observed by the different instruments of JWST/NIRSpec. We then
retrieve the abundances and temperature profiles from the synthetic observations. We find that
in most cases, assuming a homogeneous thermal structure when retrieving the atmospheric chemistry
leads to biased results, and spurious molecular detection. Explicitly modelling the data using
two profiles avoids these biases, and is statistically supported provided the wavelength coverage
is wide enough, and crucially also spanning shorter wavelengths. For the high contrast used here,
a single profile with a dilution factor performs as well as the two-profile case, with only one additional
parameter compared to the 1-D approach.
