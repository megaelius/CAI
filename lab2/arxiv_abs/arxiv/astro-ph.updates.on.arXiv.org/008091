Transmission spectra probe exoplanetary atmospheres, but they can also be strongly affected by
heterogeneities in host star photospheres through the transit light source effect. Here we build
upon our recent study of the effects of unocculted spots and faculae on M-dwarf transmission spectra,
extending the analysis to FGK dwarfs. Using a suite of rotating model photospheres, we explore spot
and facula covering fractions for varying activity levels and the associated stellar contamination
spectra. Relative to M dwarfs, we find that the typical variabilities of FGK dwarfs imply lower spot
covering fractions, though they generally increase with later spectral types, from $\sim 0.1\%$
for F dwarfs to 2-4$\%$ for late-K dwarfs. While the stellar contamination spectra are considerably
weaker than those for typical M dwarfs, we find that typically active G and K dwarfs produce visual
slopes that are detectable in high-precision transmission spectra. We examine line offsets at
H$\alpha$ and the Na and K doublets and find that unocculted faculae in K dwarfs can appreciably alter
transit depths around the Na D doublet. We find that band-averaged transit depth offsets at molecular
bands for CH$_{4}$, CO, CO$_{2}$, H$_{2}$O, N$_{2}$O, O$_{2}$, and O$_{3}$ are not detectable
for typically active FGK dwarfs, though stellar TiO/VO features are potentially detectable for
typically active late-K dwarfs. Generally, this analysis shows that inactive FGK dwarfs do not
produce detectable stellar contamination features in transmission spectra, though active FGK
host stars can produce such features and care is warranted in interpreting transmission spectra
from these systems.
