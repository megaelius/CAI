Celestial objects host interfaces between convective and stable stratified interior regions.
The interaction between both, e.g., the transfer of heat, mass, or angular momentum depends on whether
and how flows penetrate into the stable layer. Powered from the unstable, convective regions, radial
flows can pierce into the stable region depending on their inertia (overshooting). In rapidly rotating
systems, the dynamics are strongly influenced by the Coriolis force and radial flows penetrate
in stratified regions due to the geostrophic invariance of columnar convection even in the limit
of vanishing inertia. Within this study, we numerically investigate both mechanisms and hence
explore the nature of penetrative convection in rapidly rotating spherical shells. The study covers
a broad range of system parameters, such as the strength of the stratification relative to the Coriolis
force or the inertia. Guided by the application to Saturn, we model a sandwiched stable stratified
layer (SSL) surrounded by two convective zones. A comprehensive analysis of the damping behavior
of convective flows at the edges of the SSL showed that the mean penetration depth is controlled by
the ratio of stratified and unstratified buoyancy gradients and is hence independent of rotation.
A scaling law is derived and suggests that the penetration depth decreases with the square root of
the ratio of unstabilizing and stabilizing entropy gradients. The influence of the Coriolis force,
however, is evident by a modulation of the penetration depth along latitude, since convective columns
are elongated vertically and hence pierce predominantly into the SSL around mid-latitudes and
outside the tangent cylinder. Our result also show that the penetration depth decreases linearly
with the flow length scale (low pass filter), confirming predictions from the linear theory of rotating
partially stratified convection.
