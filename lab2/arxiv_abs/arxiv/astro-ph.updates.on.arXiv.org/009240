The James Webb Space Telescope will provide observational capabilities that far exceed those of
current ground- or space-based instrumentation. In particular, the NIRSpec instrument will take
highly sensitive spectroscopic data for hundreds of objects simultaneously from 0.6-5.3 microns.
Current photometric observations suggest a large and increasing number of faint (M_UV > -16) galaxies
at high-redshift, with increasing evidence that galaxies at these redshifts have optical emission
lines with extremely high equivalent widths. A simple model of their emission line fluxes and number
density evolution with redshift is used to predict the number of galaxies that NIRSpec will serendipitously
observe during normal observations with the microshutter array. At exposure times of ~20 hours
in the low-resolution prism mode, the model predicts that, on average, every open 1x3 'microslit'
will contain an un-targeted galaxy with a detectable [O III] and/or H$\alpha$ emission line; while
most of these detections are predicted to be of [O III], H $\alpha$ detections alone would still number
0.56 per open 'microslit' for this exposure time. Many of these objects are spectroscopically detectable
even when they are fainter than current photometric limits and/or their flux centroids lie outside
of the open microshutter area. The predicted number counts for such galaxies match z ~ 2 observations
of [O III] emitters from slitless grism spectroscopic surveys, as well as theoretical predictions
based on sophisticated modeling of galaxy spectral energy distributions. These serendipitous
detections could provide the largest numbers of z > 6 spectroscopic confirmations in the deepest
NIRSpec surveys.
