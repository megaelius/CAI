Studies of gas-phase radial metallicity profiles in spirals published in the last decade have diminished
the importance of galactic bars as agents that mix and flatten the profiles, contradicting results
obtained in the 1990s. We have collected a large sample of 2831 published HII region emission-line
fluxes in 51 nearby galaxies, including objects both with and without the presence of a bar, with
the aim of revisiting the issue of whether bars affect the radial metal distribution in spirals.
In this first paper of a series of two, we present the galaxy and the HII region samples. The methodology
is homogeneous for the whole data sample and includes the derivation of HII region chemical abundances,
structural parameters of bars and discs, galactocentric distances, and radial abundance profiles.
We have obtained O/H and N/O abundance ratios from the Te-based (direct) method for a sub-sample
of 610 regions, and from a variety of strong-line methods for the whole HII region sample. The strong-line
methods have been evaluated in relation to the Te-based one from both a comparison of the derived
O/H and N/O abundances for individual HII regions, and a comparison of the abundance gradients derived
from both methodologies. The median value and the standard deviation of the gradient distributions
depend on the abundance method, and those based on the O3N2 indicator tend to flatten the steepest
profiles, reducing the range of observed gradients. A detailed analysis and discussion of the derived
O/H and N/O radial abundance gradients and y-intercepts for barred and unbarred galaxies is presented
in the companion Paper II. The whole HII region catalogue including emission-line fluxes, positions
and derived abundances is made publicly available on the CDS VizieR facility, together with the
radial abundance gradients for all galaxies.
