Context: Recent near-infrared data have contributed to unveil massive and obscured stellar populations
in both new and previously known clusters in our Galaxy. These discoveries lead us to view the Milky
Way as an active star-forming machine. Aims: We look for young massive cluster candidates as over-densities
of OB-type stars. The first search, focused on the Galactic direction $l=38^{\circ}$, resulted
in the detection of two objects with a remarkable population of OB-type star candidates. Methods:
With a modified version of the friends-of-friends algorithm AUTOPOP and using 2MASS and UKIDSS-GPS
near-infrared ($J$, $H$, and $K$) photometry for one of our cluster candidates (named Masgomas-6)
we selected 30 stars for multi-object and long-slit $H$- and $K$-spectroscopy. With the spectral
classification and the near-infrared photometric data, we derive individual distance, extinction
and radial velocity. Results: Of the 30 spectroscopically observed stars, 20 are classified as
massive stars, including OB-types (dwarfs, giants and supergiants), two red supergiants, two
Wolf-Rayet (WR122-11 and the new WR122-16), and one transitional object (the LBV candidate IRAS
18576+0341). The individual distances and radial velocities do not agree with a single cluster,
indicating that we are observing two populations of massive stars in the same line-of-sight: Masgomas-6a
and Masgomas-6b. The first group of massive stars, located at 3.9$^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ kpc, contains
both Wolf-Rayets and most of the OB-dwarfs, and Masgomas-6b, at $9.6\pm0.4$ kpc, hosts the LBV candidate
and an evolved population of supergiants. We are able to identify massive stars at two Galactic arms,
but we can not clearly identify whether these massive stars form clusters or associations.
