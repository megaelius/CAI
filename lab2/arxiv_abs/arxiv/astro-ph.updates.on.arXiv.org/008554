Variable B supergiants (BSGs) constitute a heterogeneous group of stars with complex photometric
and spectroscopic behaviours. They exhibit mass-loss variations and experience different types
of oscillation modes, and there is growing evidence that variable stellar winds and photospheric
pulsations are closely related. To discuss the wind properties and variability of evolved B-type
stars, we derive new stellar and wind parameters for a sample of 19 Galactic BSGs by fitting theoretical
line profiles of H, He, and Si to the observed ones and compare them with previous determinations.
The mass-loss rate of three stars has been obtained for the first time. All stars follow the known
empirical wind momentum-luminosity relationships, and the late BSGs show the trend of the mid BSGs.
We find an empirical relationship that associates the amplitude of mass-loss variations with photometric/spectroscopic
variability on timescales of tens of days. We find that stars located on the cool side of the bi-stability
jump show a decrease in the terminal and escape velocities ratio, while their corresponding mass-loss
rates are similar to or lower than the values found for stars on the hot side. Particularly, for those
variable stars a decrease in the terminal and escape velocities ratio is accompanied by a decrease
in the mass-loss rate. Our results also suggest that radial pulsation modes with periods longer
than 6 days might be responsible for the wind variability in the mid/late-type BSGs. These radial
modes might be identified with strange modes, which are known to facilitate (enhanced) mass loss.
On the other hand, we propose that the wind behaviour of stars on the cool side of the bi-stability
jump could fit with predictions of the delta-slow hydrodynamics solution for radiation-driven
winds with highly variable ionization.
