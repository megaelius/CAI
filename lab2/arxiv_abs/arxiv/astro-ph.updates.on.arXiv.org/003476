We investigate the three-point correlation function (3PCF) in the squeezed limit by considering
galaxy pairs as discrete objects and cross-correlating them with the galaxy field. We develop an
efficient algorithm using Fast Fourier Transforms to compute such cross-correlations and their
associated pair-galaxy bias bpg and the squeezed 3PCF coefficient Qeff. We implement our method
using N-body cosmological simulations and a fiducial Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) and present
the results in both the real space and redshift space. In real space, we observe a peak in bpg and Qeff
at pair separation of ~ 2 Mpc, attributed to the fact that galaxy pairs at 2 Mpc separation trace the
most massive dark matter halos. We also see strong anisotropy in the bpg and Qeff signals that track
the large-scale filamentary structure. In redshift space, both the 2 Mpc peak and the anisotropy
are significantly smeared out along the line-of-sight due to Finger-of-God effect. In both the
real space and redshift space, the squeezed 3PCF shows a factor of 2 variation, contradicting the
hierarchical ansatz but offering rich information on the galaxy-halo connection. Thus, we explore
the possibility of using the squeezed 3PCF to constrain the HOD. When we compare two simple HOD models
that are closely matched in their projected two-point correlation function (2PCF), we do not yet
see a strong variation in the 3PCF that is clearly disentangled from variations in the projected
2PCF. Nevertheless, we propose that more complicated HOD models, e.g. those incorporating assembly
bias, can break degeneracies in the 2PCF and show a distinguishable squeezed 3PCF signal.
