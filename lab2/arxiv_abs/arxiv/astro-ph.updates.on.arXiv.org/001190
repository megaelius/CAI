We investigate the possible origin of extended emissions (EE) of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs)
with an isotropic energy of $\sim 10^{50\mbox{-}51} \ \rm erg$ and a duration of $\sim 100 \ \rm s$,
based on the compact binary (neutron star (NS)-NS or NS-black hole (BH)) merger scenario. We analyze
the evolution of magnetized neutrino-dominated accretion disks of mass $\sim 0.1 \ M_\odot$ around
BHs formed after the mergers, and estimate the power of relativistic outflows via the Blandford-Znajek
(BZ) process. We show that a rotation energy of the BH up to $\sim 10^{53} \ \rm erg$ can be extracted
with a time scale of $\sim 100 \ \rm s$ with a disk viscosity parameter of $\alpha \sim 0.01$. Such a
BZ power dissipates by clashing with non-relativistic pre-ejected matter of mass $M \sim 10^{-(2\mbox{-}4)}
\ M_\odot$, and form a mildly relativistic fireball. We show that the dissipative photospheric
emissions from such fireballs are likely in soft X-ray band ($1\mbox{-}10 \ \rm keV$) for $M \sim
10^{-2} M_\odot$ possibly in NS-NS mergers, and in the BAT band ($15\mbox{-}150 \ \rm keV$) for $M
\sim 10^{-4} M_\odot$ possibly in NS-BH mergers. In the former case, such soft EEs can provide a good
chance of $\sim {\rm 6 \ yr^{-1}} \ (\Delta \Omega_{softEE}/4\pi) \ ({\cal R}_{GW}/40 \ {\rm yr^{-1}})$
for simultaneous detections of the gravitational waves with a $\sim 0.1^\circ$ angular resolution
by soft X-ray survey facilities like Wide-Field MAXI. Here, $\Delta \Omega_{softEE}$ is the beaming
factor of the soft EEs and ${\cal R}_{GW}$ is the NS-NS merger rate detectable by advanced LIGO, advanced
Virgo, and KAGRA. While in the latter case, the observed EEs, which are associated with $\sim 25\%$
of {\it Swift} SGRBs, can be well explained although the simultaneous detection rate with the GWs
is expected to be very low $\lesssim 10^{-3} \ {\rm yr}^{-1} $.
