Cyg OB2 #8a is a massive O-type binary displaying strong non-thermal radio emission. Owing to the
compactness of this binary, emission of non-thermal X-ray photons via inverse Compton scattering
is expected. We first revised the orbital solution for Cyg OB2 #8a using new optical spectra. We then
reduced and analysed X-ray spectra obtained with XMM-Newton, Swift, INTEGRAL, and NuSTAR. The
analysis of the XMM-Newton and Swift data allows us to better characterise the X-ray emission from
the stellar winds and colliding winds region at energies below 10 keV. We confirm the variation of
the broad-band light curve of Cyg OB2 #8a along the orbit with, for the first time, the observation
of the maximum emission around phase 0.8. The minimum ratio of the X-ray to bolometric flux of Cyg
OB2 #8a remains well above the level expected for single O-type stars, indicating that the colliding
wind region is not disrupted during the periastron passage. The analysis of the full set of publicly
available INTEGRAL observations allows us to refine the upper limit on the non-thermal X-ray flux
of the Cyg OB2 region between 20 and 200 keV. Two NuSTAR observations (phases 0.028 and 0.085) allow
us to study the Cyg OB2 #8a spectrum up to 30 keV. These data do not provide evidence of the presence
of non-thermal X-rays, but bring more stringent constraints on the flux of a putative non-thermal
component. Finally, we computed, thanks to a new dedicated model, the anisotropic inverse Compton
emission generated in the wind shock region. The theoretical non-thermal emission appears to be
compatible with observational limits and the kinetic luminosity computed from these models is
in good agreement with the unabsorbed flux observed below 10 keV.
