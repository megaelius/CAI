We present a three-dimensional kinematic reconstruction of the optically-emitting, oxygen-rich
ejecta of supernova remnant N132D in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Data were obtained with the 6.5
m Magellan telescope in combination with the IMACS+GISMO instrument and survey [O III] $\lambda\lambda$4959,5007
line emission in a ${\sim}$3$^{\prime}~\times$ 3$^{\prime}$ region centered on N132D. The spatial
and spectral resolution of our data enable detailed examination of the optical ejecta structure.
The majority of N132D's optically bright oxygen ejecta are arranged in a torus-like geometry tilted
approximately 28$^{\circ}$ with respect to the plane of the sky. The torus has a radius of 4.4 pc ($D_{\rm
LMC}$/50 kpc), exhibits a blue-shifted radial velocity asymmetry of $-3000$ to $+2300$ km s$^{-1}$,
and has a conspicuous break in its circumference. Assuming homologous expansion from the geometric
center of O-rich filaments, the average expansion velocity of 1745 km s$^{-1}$ translates to an
age since explosion of 2450 $\pm$ 195 yr. A faint, spatially-separated "runaway knot" (RK) with
total space velocity of 3650 km s$^{-1}$ is nearly perpendicular to the torus plane and coincident
with X-ray emission that is substantially enhanced in Si relative to the LMC and N132D's bulk ejecta.
These kinematic and chemical signatures suggest that the RK may have had its origin deep within the
progenitor star. Overall, the main shell morphology and high-velocity, Si-enriched components
of N132D have remarkable similarity with that of Cassiopeia A, which was the result of a Type IIb supernova
explosion. Our results underscore the need for further observations and simulations that can robustly
reconcile whether the observed morphology is dominated by explosion dynamics or shaped by interaction
with the environment.
