This work presents a study of galactic outflows driven by stellar feedback. We extract main sequence
disc galaxies with stellar mass $10^9\le$ M$_{\star}/$M$_{\odot} \le 5.7\times10^{10}$ at redshift
$z=0$ from the highest resolution cosmological simulation of the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies
and their Environments (EAGLE) set. Synthetic gas rotation velocity and velocity dispersion ($\sigma$)
maps are created and compared to observations of disc galaxies obtained with the Sydney-AAO Multi-object
Integral field spectrograph (SAMI), where $\sigma$-values greater than $150$ km s$^{-1}$ are
most naturally explained by bipolar outflows powered by starburst activity. We find that the extension
of the simulated edge-on (pixelated) velocity dispersion probability distribution depends on
stellar mass and star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), with low-M$_{\star}/$low-$\Sigma_{\rm
SFR}$ galaxies showing a narrow peak at low $\sigma$ ($\sim30$ km s$^{-1}$) and more active, high-M$_{\star}/$high-$\Sigma_{\rm
SFR}$ galaxies reaching $\sigma>150$ km s$^{-1}$. Although supernova-driven galactic winds
in the EAGLE simulations may not entrain enough gas with T $<10^5$ K compared to observed galaxies,
we find that gas temperature is a good proxy for the presence of outflows. There is a direct correlation
between the thermal state of the gas and its state of motion as described by the $\sigma$-distribution.
The following equivalence relations hold in EAGLE: $i)$ low-$\sigma$ peak $\,\Leftrightarrow\,$
disc of the galaxy $\,\Leftrightarrow\,$ gas with T $<10^5$ K; $ii)$ high-$\sigma$ tail $\,\Leftrightarrow\,$
galactic winds $\,\Leftrightarrow\,$ gas with T $\ge 10^5$ K.
