Context. Barium (Ba) stars are dwarf and giant stars enriched in elements heavier than iron produced
by the slow neutron-capture process (s process). They belong to binary systems where the primary
star evolved through the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase,during which it produced the s-process
elements and transferred them onto the secondary, now observed as a Ba star. Aims. We compare the
largest homogeneous set of Ba giant star observations of the s-process elements Y, Zr, La, Ce, and
Nd with AGB nucleosynthesis models to reach a better understanding of the s process in AGB stars.
Methods. By considering the light-s (ls: Y and Zr) heavy-s (hs: La, Ce, and Nd) and elements individually,
we computed for the first time quantitative error bars for the different hs-element/ls-element
abundance ratios, and for each of the sample stars. We compared these ratios to low-mass AGB nucleosynthesis
models. We excluded La from our analysis because the strong La lines in some of the sample stars cause
an overestimation and unreliable abundance determination, as compared to the other observed hs-type
elements. Results. All the computed hs-type to ls-type element ratios show a clear trend of increasing
with decreasing metallicity with a small spread (less than a factor of 3). This trend is predicted
by low-mass AGB models where 13C is the main neutron source. The comparison with rotating AGB models
indicates the need for the presence of an angular momentum transport mechanism that should not transport
chemical species, but significantly reduce the rotational speed of the core in the advanced stellar
evolutionary stages. This is an independent confirmation of asteroseismology observations of
the slow down of core rotation in giant stars, and of rotational velocities of white dwarfs lower
than predicted by models without an extra angular momentum transport mechanism.
