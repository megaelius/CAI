Aims: We present and study spatially resolved imaging obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) of multiple $^{12}$CO($J=$6$-$5, 8$-$7 and 9$-$8) and two H$_2$O(2$_{02}-$1$_{11}$
and 2$_{11}-$2$_{02}$) emission lines and cold dust continuum toward the gravitationally lensed
dusty star forming galaxy SPT0346-52 at z=$5.656$. Methods: Using a visibility-domain source-plane
reconstruction we probe the structure and dynamics of the different components of the interstellar
medium (ISM) in this galaxy down to scales of 1 kpc in the source plane. Results: Measurements of the
intrinsic sizes of the different CO emission lines indicate that the higher J transitions trace
more compact regions in the galaxy. Similarly, we find smaller dust continuum intrinsic sizes with
decreasing wavelength, based on observations at rest-frame 130, 300 and 450$\mu$m. The source
shows significant velocity structure, and clear asymmetry where an elongated structure is observed
in the source plane with significant variations in their reconstructed sizes. This could be attributed
to a compact merger or turbulent disk rotation. The differences in velocity structure through the
different line tracers, however, hint at the former scenario in agreement with previous [CII] line
imaging results. Measurements of the CO line ratios and magnifications yield significant variations
as a function of velocity, suggesting that modeling of the ISM using integrated values could be misinterpreted.
Modeling of the ISM in SPT0346-52 based on delensed fluxes indicate a highly dense and warm medium,
qualitatively similar to that observed in high redshift quasar hosts.
