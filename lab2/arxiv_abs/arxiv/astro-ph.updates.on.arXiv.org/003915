The similarity of the absolute luminosity profiles of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) has led their use
in extragalactic astronomy as secondary standard candles. In general, the empirical relation
of SNIa on the absolute peak magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ is calibrated by Cepheid variables in the near
distance scale and directly extrapolated to much farther distances. Two main problems arise. First
of all, their calibration, in particular the determination of $M_{\rm B}$, depends on the empirical
relationship of Cepheid variables, which suffers from various uncertainties. The second is related
to the homogeneity of SNIa in their true $M_{\rm B}$, which is known to be poor in different environments.
The observed gravitational-wave(GW) signal of the coalescence of compact binary systems and their
electromagnetic counterparts provide the novel and model-independent way to address these two
problems. In the era of second-generation GW detectors, the low-redshift GW sources provide a method
to calibrate the empirical relationship of SNIa, using their self-calibrated distances. In this
Letter, for the first time, we use the event GW170817 to calibrate the empirical relation in different
low redshift ranges, and find that the calibration results are consistent with the ones derived
from the Cepheid variables. The uncertainties of $M_{\rm B}$ in both methods are also comparable.
By the observations of third-generation GW detectors, GW sources can also be used to measure the
values of $M_{\rm B}$ for the high-redshift SNIe, which provides a unique opportunity to study the
dependence of $M_{\rm B}$ on the local environment, strength of gravity, and the intrinsic properties
of the explosion, in addition to test the homogeneity of standard candles. We find that the uncertainties
of $M_{\rm B}$ in both high and low redshifts are more than one order of magnitude smaller than the
current accuracy.
