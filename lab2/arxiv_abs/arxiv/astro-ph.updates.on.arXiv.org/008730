Next-generation planetary tracking methods, such as interplanetary laser ranging (ILR) and same-beam
interferometry (SBI) promise an orders-of-magnitude increase in the accuracy of measurements
of solar system dynamics. This requires a reconsideration of modelling strategies for the translational
and rotational dynamics of natural bodies, to ensure that model errors are well below the measurement
uncertainties. The influence of the gravitational interaction of the full mass distributions
of celestial bodies, the so-called figure-figure effects, will need to be included for selected
future missions. The mathematical formulation of this problem to arbitrary degree is often provided
in an elegant and compact manner that is not trivially relatable to the formulation used in space
geodesy and ephemeris generation. This complicates the robust implementation of such a model in
operational software packages. We formulate the problem in a manner that is directly compatible
with the implementation used in typical dynamical modelling codes: in terms of spherical harmonic
coefficients and Legendre polynomials. An analytical formulation for the associated variational
equations for both translational and rotational motion is derived. We apply our methodology to
both Phobos and the KW4 binary asteroid system, to analyze the influence of figure-figure effects
during estimation from next-generation tracking data. For the case of Phobos, omitting these effects
during estimation results in relative errors of $0.42\%$ and $0.065\%$ for the $\bar{C}_{20}$
and $\bar{C}_{22}$ spherical harmonic gravity field coefficients, respectively. These values
are below current uncertainties, but orders of magnitude larger than those obtained from past simulations
for accurate tracking of a future Phobos lander.
