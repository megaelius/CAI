We couple state of the art cosmological simulations (GADGET-2) with a dust model and a radiative
transfer code (pCRASH) to build a complete model for high-redshift Lyman Alpha emitters (LAEs).
Due to poor constraints available on the escape fraction of HI ionizing photons (f_esc) from galaxies,
we use five different values f_esc=0.05,0.25,0.5,0.75,0.95 to post-process the cosmological
simulation with pCRASH. Starting from a completely neutral Universe, we run pCRASH until reionization
is complete, i.e. the average neutral hydrogen (HI) fraction drops to <X_HI> ~ 10^-4. For
a given f_esc and <X_HI> combination, the only free-parameter left to match model results
to observations is the relative escape of Lyman Alpha (Lya) and continuum photons from the galactic
environment (f_\alpha/f_c). Starting from a scenario wherein dust is homogeneously distributed
(f_\alpha/f_c ~ 0.68), we find that the observed LAE UV and Lya luminosity functions (LFs) jointly
constrain f_esc ~ 0.05 and <X_HI> <= 0.1. In the scenario that dust is clumped, we find a
three-dimensional degeneracy between f_esc, <X_HI> and f_\alpha/f_c such that a decrease
in the intrinsic Lya luminosity can be compensated by an increase in the Lya transmission through
the intergalactic medium and/or an increasing Lya escape out of the galactic environment. In the
latter scenario, the theoretical model can be reconciled with observations for a much larger parameter
space: <X_HI> ~ 0.5-10^-4, f_esc ~ 0.05-0.50 and f_\alpha/f_c=0.6-1.8. In other words,
if dust is indeed clumped in the interstellar medium of high-redshift galaxies, we can not differentiate
between a Universe which is either completely ionized or half neutral, or has an f_esc ranging between
5-50%.
