We used the data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope to characterise the {\gamma}-ray flux
variability of blazars on month-like time scales. Our sample consists of 1120 blazars of which 481
are flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and 639 are BL Lac objects (BL Lacs). We generated monthly
binned light curves of our sample for a period of approximately nine years from 2008 August to 2017
December and quantified variability by using excess variance (F_var). On month-like time scales,
371/481 FSRQs are variable ( 80%), while only about 50% (304/639) of BL Lacs are variable. This suggests
that FSRQs are more variable than BL Lac objects. We find a mean F_var of 0.55 +/- 0.33 and 0.47 +/- 0.29
for FSRQs and BL Lacs respectively. Large F_var in FSRQs is also confirmed from the analysis of the
ensemble structure function. By Dividing our sample of blazars based on the position of the synchrotron
peak in their broad-band spectral energy distribution, we find that the low synchrotron peaked
(LSP) sources have the largest mean F_var value of 0.54 +/- 0.32 while the intermediate synchrotron
peaked (ISP) and high synchrotron peaked (HSP) sources have mean F_var values of 0.45 +/- 0.25 and
0.47 +/- 0.33 respectively. On month-like time scales, we find FSRQs to show a high duty cycle (DC)
of variability of 66% relative to BL Lacs that show a DC of 36%. We find that both the F_var and time scale
of variability ({\tau}) do not correlate with the black hole mass. We note that F_var is found to be
weakly correlated with Doppler factor ({\delta}) and {\tau} is also weakly correlated with {\delta}.
Most of the sources in our sample have {\tau} of the order of days, which might be related to processes
in the jet. We find marginal difference in the distribution of {\tau} between FSRQs and BL Lacs.
