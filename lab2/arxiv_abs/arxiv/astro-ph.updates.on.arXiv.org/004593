We report observations of the radio galaxy 3C317 (at z=0.0345) located at the center of the Abell
cluster A2052, obtained with the VLT/MUSE integral field spectrograph. The Chandra images of this
cluster show cavities in the X-ray emitting gas, which were produced by the expansion of the radio
lobes inflated by the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Our exquisite MUSE data show with unprecedented
detail the complex network of line emitting filaments enshrouding the northern X-ray cavity. We
do not detect any emission lines from the southern cavity, with a luminosity asymmetry between the
two regions higher than about 75. The emission lines produced by the warm phase of the interstellar
medium (WIM) enable us to obtain unique information on the properties of the emitting gas. We find
dense gas (up to 270 cm-3) that makes up part of a global quasi spherical outflow that is driven by the
radio source, and obtain a direct estimate of the expansion velocity of the cavities (265 km s-1).
The emission lines diagnostic rules out ionization from the AGN or from star-forming regions, suggesting
instead ionization from slow shocks or from cosmic rays. The striking asymmetric line emission
observed between the two cavities contrasts with the less pronounced differences between the north
and south sides in the hot gas; this represents a significant new ingredient for our understanding
of the process of the exchange of energy between the relativistic plasma and the external medium.
We conclude that the expanding radio lobes displace the hot tenuous phase of the interstellar medium
(ISM), but also impact the colder and denser ISM phases. These results show the effects of the AGN
on its host and the importance of radio mode feedback.
