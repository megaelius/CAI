Direct-imaging exoplanet surveys have discovered a class of 5-20 \Mjup\space substellar companions
at separations >100 AU from their host stars, which present a challenge to planet and star formation
models. Detailed analysis of the orbital architecture of these systems can provide constraints
on possible formation mechanisms, including the possibility they were dynamically ejected onto
a wide orbit. We present astrometry for the wide planetary-mass companion GSC~6214-210\,b (240
AU; $\approx$14 \Mjup) obtained using NIRC2 with adaptive optics at the Keck telescope over ten
years. Our measurements achieved astrometric uncertainties of $\approx$1 mas per epoch. We determined
a relative motion of $1.12 \pm 0.15$~mas~yr$^{-1}$ (0.61 $\pm$ 0.09 km s$^{-1}$), the first detection
of orbital motion for this companion. We compute the minimum periastron for the companion due to
our measured velocity vector, and derive constraints on orbital parameters through our modified
implementation of the Orbits for the Impatient rejection sampling algorithm. We find that close
periastron orbits, which could indicate the companion was dynamically scattered, are present
in our posterior but have low likelihoods. For all orbits in our posterior, we assess the detectability
of close-in companions that could have scattered GSC~6214-210\,b from a closer orbit, and find
that most potential scatterers would have been detected in previous imaging. We conclude that formation
at small orbital separation and subsequent dynamical scattering through interaction with another
potential close-in object is an unlikely formation pathway for this companion. We also update stellar
and substellar properties for the system due to the new parallax from \textit{Gaia} DR2.
