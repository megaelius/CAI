Our goal is to take an inventory of complex molecules in three well-known high-mass protostars for
which disks or toroids have been claimed and to study the similarities and differences with a sample
of massive YSOs without evidence of such flattened disk-like structures. With a disk-like geometry,
UV radiation can escape more readily and potentially affect the ice and gas chemistry on hot-core
scales. A partial submillimeter line survey, targeting CH3OH, H2CO, C2H5OH, HCOOCH3, CH3OCH3,
CH3CN, HNCO, NH2CHO, C2H5CN, CH2CO, HCOOH, CH3CHO, and CH3CCH, was made toward three massive YSOs
with disk-like structures, IRAS20126+4104, IRAS18089-1732, and G31.41+0.31. Rotation temperatures
and column densities were determined by the rotation diagram method, as well as by independent spectral
modeling. The molecular abundances were compared with previous observations of massive YSOs without
evidence of any disk structure, targeting the same molecules with the same settings and using the
same analysis method. Consistent with previous studies, different complex organic species have
different characteristic rotation temperatures and can be classified either as warm (>100
K) or cold (<100 K). The excitation temperatures and abundance ratios are similar from source
to source and no significant difference can be established between the two source types. Acetone,
CH3COCH3, is detected for the first time in G31.41+0.31 and IRAS18089-1732. Temperatures and abundances
derived from the two analysis methods generally agree within factors of a few. The lack of chemical
differentiation between massive YSOs with and without observed disks suggest either that the chemical
complexity is already fully established in the ices in the cold prestellar phase or that the material
experiences similar physi- cal conditions and UV exposure through outflow cavities during the
short embedded lifetime.
