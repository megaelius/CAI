The rotational and magnetic properties of many magnetic hot stars are poorly characterized, therefore
the MiMeS and BinaMIcS collaborations have collected extensive high-dispersion spectropolarimetric
datasets of these targets. We present longitudinal magnetic field measurements $\langle B_{\rm
z}\rangle$ for 52 early B-type stars (B5 to B0), with which we attempt to determine their rotational
periods $P_{\rm rot}$. Supplemented with high-resolution spectroscopy, low-resolution DAO
circular spectropolarimetry, and archival Hipparcos photometry, we determined $P_{\rm rot}$
for 10 stars, leaving only 5 stars for which $P_{\rm rot}$ could not be determined. Rotational ephemerides
for 14 stars were refined via comparison of new to historical magnetic measurements. The distribution
of $P_{\rm rot}$ is very similar to that observed for the cooler Ap/Bp stars. We also measured $v\sin{i}$
and $v_{\rm mac}$ for all stars. Comparison to non-magnetic stars shows that $v\sin{i}$ is much
lower for magnetic stars, an expected consequence of magnetic braking. We also find evidence that
$v_{\rm mac}$ is lower for magnetic stars. LSD profiles extracted using single-element masks revealed
widespread, systematic discrepancies in $\langle B_{\rm z}\rangle$ between different elements:
this effect is apparent only for chemically peculiar stars, suggesting it is a consequence of chemical
spots. Sinusoidal fits to H line $\langle B_{\rm z}\rangle$ measurements (which should be minimally
affected by chemical spots), yielded evidence of surface magnetic fields more complex than simple
dipoles in 6 stars for which this has not previously been reported; however, in all 6 cases the second-
and third-order amplitudes are small relative to the first-order (dipolar) amplitudes.
