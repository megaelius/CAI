Centaurus A, with its gas-rich elliptical host galaxy, NGC 5128, is the nearest radio galaxy at a
distance of 3.8 Mpc. Its proximity allows us to study the interaction between an active galactic
nucleus, radio jets, and molecular gas in great detail. We present ALMA observations of low J transitions
of three CO isotopologues, HCN, HCO$^{+}$, HNC, CN, and CCH toward the inner projected 500 pc of NGC
5128. Our observations resolve physical sizes down to 40 pc. By observing multiple chemical probes,
we determine the physical and chemical conditions of the nuclear interstellar medium of NGC 5128.
This region contains molecular arms associated with the dust lanes and a circumnuclear disk (CND)
interior to the molecular arms. The CND is approximately 400 pc by 200 pc and appears to be chemically
distinct from the molecular arms. It is dominated by dense gas tracers while the molecular arms are
dominated by $^{12}$CO and its rare isotopologues. The CND has a higher temperature, elevated CN/HCN
and HCN/HNC intensity ratios, and much weaker $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O emission than the molecular
arms. This suggests an influence from the AGN on the CND molecular gas. There is also absorption against
the AGN with a low velocity complex near the systemic velocity and a high velocity complex shifted
by about 60 km s$^{-1}$. We find similar chemical properties between the CND in emission and both
the low and high velocity absorption complexes implying that both likely originate from the CND.
If the HV complex does originate in the CND, then that gas would correspond to gas falling toward the
supermassive black hole.
