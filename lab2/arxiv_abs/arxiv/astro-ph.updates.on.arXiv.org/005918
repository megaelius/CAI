NGC 281 is a complex region of star formation at 2.8 kpc. This complex is situated 300 pc above the Galactic
plane, and appears to be part of a 270 pc diameter ring of atomic and molecular clouds expanding at
22 km/s (Megeath et al. 2003). It appears that two modes of triggered star formation are at work here:
an initial supernova to trigger the ring complex and the initial O~stars and the subsequent triggering
of low mass star formation by photoevaporation driven molecular core compression. To get a complete
census of the young stellar population, we use \textbf{observations from} Chandra ACIS 100 ksec
coupled with data from 2MASS and Spitzer. The Master X-ray catalog has 446 sources detected in different
bandpasses. We present the spatial distribution of Class~I, II and III sources to study the progress
of star formation. We also determine the gas to dust ratio $N_H/A_K$ to be 1.93 $\pm$ 0.47 $\times
10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ mag$^{-1}$ for this region. \textbf{In this article, we present NGC 281 as a
good target to study with the 3.6-m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) in spectroscopy. With these
spectra, we look for evidence for the pre-main-sequence (PMS) nature of the objects, study the properties
of the detected emission lines as a function of evolutionary class, and obtain spectral types for
the observed young stellar objects (YSOs). The temperatures implied by the spectral types can be
combined with luminosities determined from the near-infrared (NIR) photometry to construct Hertzsprung--Russell
(HR) diagrams for the clusters. By comparing the positions of the YSOs in the HR diagrams with the
PMS tracks, we can determine the ages of the embedded sources and study the relative ages of the YSOs
with and without optically thick circumstellar disks.
