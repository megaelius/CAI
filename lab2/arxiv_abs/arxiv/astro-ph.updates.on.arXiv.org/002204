We study the decay signatures of Asymmetric Dark Matter (ADM) via higher dimension operators which
are responsible for generating the primordial dark matter (DM) asymmetry. Since the signatures
are sensitive both to the nature of the higher dimension operator generating the DM asymmetry and
to the sign of the baryon or lepton number that the DM carries, indirect detection may provide a window
into the nature of the mechanism which generates the DM asymmetry. We consider in particular dimension-6
fermionic operators of the form ${\cal O}_{ADM} = X {\cal O}_{B-L}/M^2$, where ${\cal O}_{B-L}
= u^c d^c d^c,~\ell \ell e^c,~q \ell d^c$ (or operators related through a Hermitian conjugate) with
the scale $M$ around or just below the GUT scale. We derive constraints on ADM particles both in the
natural mass range (around a few GeV), as well as in the range between 100 GeV to 10 TeV. For light ADM,
we focus on constraints from both the low energy gamma ray data and proton/anti-proton fluxes. For
heavy ADM, we consider $\gamma$-rays and proton/anti-proton fluxes, and we fit $e^+/e^-$ data
from AMS-02 and H.E.S.S. (neglecting the Fermi charged particle fluxes which disagree with AMS-02
below 100 GeV). We show that, although the best fit regions from electron/positron measurement
are still in tension with other channels on account of the H.E.S.S. measurement at high energies,
compared to an ordinary symmetric dark matter scenario, the decay of DM with a primordial asymmetry
reduces the tension. Better measurement of the flux at high energy will be necessary to draw a definite
conclusion about the viability of decaying DM as source for the signals.
