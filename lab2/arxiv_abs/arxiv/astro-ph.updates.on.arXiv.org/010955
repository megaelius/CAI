We used the spectroscopic and astrometric data provided from the GALAH DR2 and Gaia DR2, respectively,
for a large sample of stars to investigate the behaviour of the [$\alpha$/Fe] abundances via two
procedures, i.e. kinematically and spectroscopically. With the kinematical procedure, we investigated
the distribution of the [$\alpha$/Fe] abundances into the high/low probability thin disc, and
high/low probability thick-disc populations in terms of total space velocity, [Fe/H] abundance,
and age. The high probability thin-disc stars dominate in all sub-intervals of [$\alpha$/Fe],
including the rich ones: [$\alpha$/Fe]$>0.3$ dex, where the high probability thick-disc stars
are expected to dominate. This result can be explained by the limiting apparent magnitude of the
GALAH DR2 ($V<14$ mag) and intermediate Galactic latitude of the star sample. Stars in the four populations
share equivalent [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Fe/H] abundances, total space velocities and ages. Hence,
none of these parameters can be used alone for separation of a sample of stars into different populations.
High probability thin-disc stars with abundance $-1.3<{\rm[Fe/H]}\leq -0.5$ dex and age $9<\tau\leq13$
Gyr are assumed to have different birth places relative to the metal rich and younger ones. With the
spectroscopic procedure, we separated the sample stars into $\alpha$-rich and $\alpha$-poor
categories by means of their ages as well as their [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Fe/H] abundances. Stars older
than 8 Gyr are richer in [$\alpha$/Fe] than the younger ones. We could estimate the abundance [$\alpha$/Fe]=0.14
dex as the boundery separating the $\alpha$-rich and $\alpha$-poor sub-samples in the [$\alpha$/Fe]$\times$[Fe/H]
plane.
