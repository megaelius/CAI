Dust and starlight are modeled for the KINGFISH project galaxies. With data from 3.6 micron to 500
micron, models are strongly constrained. For each pixel in each galaxy we estimate (1) dust surface
density; (2) q_PAH, the dust mass fraction in PAHs; (3) distribution of starlight intensities heating
the dust; (4) luminosity emitted by the dust; and (5) dust luminosity from regions with high starlight
intensity. The models successfully reproduce both global and resolved spectral energy distributions.
We provide well-resolved maps for the dust properties. As in previous studies, we find q_PAH to be
an increasing function of metallicity, above a threshold Z/Z_sol approx 0.15. Dust masses are obtained
by summing the dust mass over the map pixels; these "resolved" dust masses are consistent with the
masses inferred from model fits to the global photometry. The global dust-to-gas ratios obtained
from this study correlate with galaxy metallicities. Systems with Z/Z_sol > 0.5 have most of their
refractory elements locked up in dust, whereas when Z/Z_sol < 0.3 most of these elements tend to remain
in the gas phase. Within galaxies, we find that q_PAH is suppressed in regions with unusually warm
dust with nu L_nu(70 um) > 0.4L_dust. With knowledge of one long-wavelength flux density ratio (e.g.,
f_{160}/f_{500}), the minimum starlight intensity heating the dust (U_min) can be estimated to
within ~50%. For the adopted dust model, dust masses can be estimated to within ~0.07 dex accuracy
using the 500 micron luminosity nu L_nu(500) alone. There are additional systematic errors arising
from the choice of dust model, but these are hard to estimate. These calibrated prescriptions may
be useful for studies of high-redshift galaxies.
