The aim of this paper is the spectroscopic study of a dozen of galaxies belonging to the field of the
proto-cluster associated with the radio galaxy (RG) 7C 1756+6520 at z = 1.4156. In particular, we
focus on the characterization of the nuclear activity. This analysis has been performed thanks
to rest-frame optical spectra taken with the LBT-LUCI. The spectral coverages allowed us to observe
emission lines such as Halpha, Hbeta, [Oiii]5007 A, and [Nii]6583 A at the z of the central RG. We observed
the central part of the proto-cluster, suitable to include the RG, several spectroscopically-confirmed
AGN belonging to the proto-cluster, and other objects that might be members of the proto-cluster.
For 4 already identified proto-cluster members, we derived z by detecting emission lines never
detected before for these galaxies. We identified a new proto-cluster member and 8 new possible
proto-cluster members. The stacked spectrum of the galaxies in which we detected the [Oiii]5007
A emission line revealed the presence of the second line of the [Oiii] doublet at 4959 A and of Hbeta,
confirming their belonging to the proto-cluster. Collecting all members identified so far, we
defined 31 galaxies, including the central RG, around z = 1.4152 +/- 0.056, corresponding to peculiar
velocities <~5000 km/s with respect to the RG. The PV phase-space diagram suggests that 3 proto-cluster
AGN and the central RG might be a "virialized" population that has been coexisting for a long time
in the densest core region of this forming structure. This proto-cluster is characterized by a high
fraction of AGN (23%), and for 1 of them, AGN.1317, we produced 2 BPT diagrams. The high fraction of
AGN and their distribution within the proto-cluster seem to be consistent with predictions of some
theoretical models on AGN growth and feedback, based on galaxy interactions and ram pressure as
triggers of AGN activity.
