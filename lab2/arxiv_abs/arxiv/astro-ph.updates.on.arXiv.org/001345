(abridged) Context: Solar-like differential rotation is characterized by a rapidly rotating
equator and slower poles. However, theoretical models and numerical simulations can also result
in a slower equator and faster poles when the overall rotation is slow. Aims: We study the critical
rotational influence under which differential rotation flips from solar-like (fast equator,
slow poles) to an anti-solar one (slow equator, fast poles). We also estimate the non-diffusive
($\Lambda$-effect) and diffusive (turbulent viscosity) contributions to the Reynolds stress.
Methods: We perform three-dimensional numerical simulations of mildly turbulent convection
in spherical wedge geometry. We regulate the convective velocities by varying the amount of heat
transported by thermal conduction, turbulent diffusion, and resolved convection. Results: Increasing
the efficiency of resolved convection leads to a reduction of the rotational influence on the flow
and a sharp transition from solar-like to anti-solar differential rotation for Coriolis numbers
around 1.3. We confirm the recent finding of a large-scale flow bistability: contrasted with running
the models from an initial condition with unprescribed differential rotation, the initialization
of the model with certain kind of rotation profile sustains the solution over a wider parameter range.
Conclusions: Our results may have implications for real stars that start their lives as rapid rotators
implying solar-like rotation in the early main-sequence evolution. As they slow down, they might
be able to retain solar-like rotation for lower Coriolis numbers, i.e. longer in time, before switching
to anti-solar rotation. This could partially explain the puzzling findings of anti-solar rotation
profiles for models in the solar parameter regime.
