We study the abundance of star-forming and quiescent galaxies in a sample of 21 massive clusters
at 0.5<z<0.7, detected with the Planck satellite. We measure the cluster galaxy stellar mass function
(SMF), which is a fundamental observable to study and constrain the formation and evolution of galaxies.
Our measurements are based on homogeneous and deep multi-band photometry spanning u- to the Ks-band
for each cluster and are supported by spectroscopic data from different programs. The galaxy population
is separated between quiescent and star-forming galaxies based on their rest-frame U-V and V-J
colours. The SMF is compared to that of field galaxies at the same redshifts, using data from the COSMOS/UltraVISTA
survey. We find that the shape of the SMF of star-forming galaxies does not depend on environment,
while the SMF of quiescent galaxies has a significantly steeper low-mass slope in the clusters compared
to the field. We estimate the environmental quenching efficiency (f_EQ), i.e. the probability
for a galaxy that would normally be star forming in the field, to be quenched due to its environment.
The f_EQ shows no stellar-mass dependence in any environment, but it increases from 40% in the cluster
outskirts to ~90% in the cluster centres. The radial signature of f_EQ provides constraints on where
the dominant quenching mechanism operates in these clusters and on what timescale. Exploring these
using a simple model based on galaxy orbits obtained from an N-body simulation, we find a clear degeneracy
between both parameters. For example, the quenching process may either be triggered on a long (~3
Gyr) time scale at large radii (r~8R_500), or happen well within 1 Gyr at r<R_500. The radius where
quenching is triggered is at least r_quench> 0.67R_500 (95%CL). The ICM density at this location
suggests that ram-pressure stripping of the cold gas is a likely cause of quenching. [Abridged]
