A non-canonical scalar tachyon field is a viable candidate for dark energy and has been found to be
in good agreement with observational data. Although this model alleviates the theoretical problem
of fine-tuning the $\Lambda CDM$ model suffers from, background data alone cannot completely rule
out degeneracy between this model and others. To further constrain the parameters, apart from the
distance measurements, we study perturbations in tachyon scalar field and how they affect matter
clustering. We consider two tachyon potentials for this study, an inverse square potential and
an exponential potential. We study the evolution of the gravitational potential, matter density
contrast and dark energy density contrast, and compare them with the evolution in the $\Lambda CDM
$ model. Although perturbations in dark energy at sub-Hubble scales are negligible in comparison
with matter perturbations, they cannot be ignored at Hubble and super-Hubble scales ($\lambda_p
> 1000$ Mpc). We also study the evolution of growth function and growth rate of matter and find that
the growth rate is significantly suppressed in dark energy dominated era with respect to the growth
rate for $\Lambda CDM$ model. A comparison of these models with Redshift Space Distortion growth
rate data is presented by way of calculating $f\sigma_8(z)$. There is a tension of larger than $3\sigma$
between growth rate data and Planck-2018 Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation data for $\Lambda
CDM$ model. We present constraints on free parameters of these models and show that perturbations
in the tachyon scalar field reduce this tension between different data sets.
