We report new detections and limits from a NOEMA and ALMA CO(1-0) search for molecular outflows in
13 local galaxies with high FIR surface brightness, and combine with results from the literature.
CO line ratios and outflow structure provide some constraints on the conversion from observables
to quantities such as molecular mass outflow rates. Ratios between outflow emission in higher J
CO transitions and in CO(1-0) typically are consistent with excitation Ri1<~1. For IRAS 13120-5453,
however, R31=2.10 indicates optically thin CO in the outflow. Like much of the outflow literature,
we use alpha(CO) = 0.8, and we present arguments for using C=1 in deriving molecular mass outflow
rates Mdot = C*M*v/R. We compare the two main methods for molecular outflow detection: CO mm interferometry
and Herschel OH spectroscopy. For 26 sources studied with both methods, we find 80% agreement in
detecting vout>~150km/s outflows, and non-matches can be plausibly ascribed to outflow geometry
and SNR. For 12 bright ULIRGs with detailed OH-based outflow modeling, CO outflows are detected
in all but one. Outflow masses, velocities, and sizes for these 11 sources agree well between the
two methods, and modest remaining differences may relate to the different but overlapping regions
sampled by CO emission and OH absorption. Outflow properties correlate better with AGN luminosity
and with bolometric luminosity than with FIR surface brightness. The most massive outflows are
found for systems with current AGN activity, but significant outflows in non-AGN systems must relate
to star formation or to AGN activity in the recent past. We report scaling relations for the increase
of outflow mass, rate, momentum rate, and kinetic power with bolometric luminosity. Short ~10^6yr
flow times and some sources with resolved multiple outflow episodes support a role of intermittent
driving, likely by AGN. (abridged)
