In this study, pulsational and physical characteristics of two $\delta$ Scuti stars, V775 Tau and
V483 Tau, are analysed by using four-year high-precision photometric data of STEREO satellite.
Thus, it is aimed to gain new insights into behaviours of these pulsators and evolution of $\delta$
Scuti, $\gamma$ Dor and Am type stars. The data are taken between 2007--2011 and examined with the
help of the Lomb-Scargle method. The detection precision in the four-year combined data is around
$10^{-5}$ c/d in frequency and $10^{-5}$ mag in amplitude. It is revealed that V775 Tau exhibits
weak pulsation characteristic which is interpreted as the existence of the interaction between
the helium loss in the partial ionization zone and pulsation intensities. It is also considered
that the absence of strong pulsations is also related to the evolution status of the star. Further,
its periodogram shows low-frequency peaks. If these oscillations are g-modes, V775 Tau can be thought
to be one of the rare stars that show all $\gamma$ Dor, $\delta$ Scuti and Am type variations. V483
Tau is comparatively more luminous, hotter and has higher rotational velocity. Therefore, although
it shares the same region with V775 Tau in the H-R diagram, it is not considered to be an Am star. Yet,
it exactly overlaps with the $\gamma\,$ Dor stars. These clues as well as g-modes detected in its
periodogram indicate that V483\,Tau is a hybrid star. Finally, both V775 Tau and V483 Tau display
period changes whose rates are between $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-4}$ $yr^{-1}$. Considering the $\delta$
Scuti nature, it may be speculated that these changes are non-evolutionary.
