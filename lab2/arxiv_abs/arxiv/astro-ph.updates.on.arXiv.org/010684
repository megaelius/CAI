We present Br$\gamma$ emission line kinematics of the nuclear region of NGC 253, recently known
to host a strong galactic wind that limits the global star formation of the galaxy. We obtained high-resolution
long-slit spectroscopic data with PHOENIX at Gemini-South, positioning the slit on the nucleus
Infrared Core (IRC), close to the nuclear disk major axis. The spatial resolution was 0.35"($\sim$6
pc) and the slit length 14"($\sim$240 pc). The spectral resolution was $\sim$74000, unprecedented
high for galactic nuclei observations at $\sim$2.1$\mu$m. The line profiles appear highly complex,
with blue asymmetry up to 3.5'' away of the IRC, and red asymmetries further away to NE. Several Gaussian
components are necessary to fit the profile, nevertheless a narrow and a wide ones predominate.
The IRC presents kinematic widths above 700 kms$^{-1}$ (FWZI), and broad component FWHM$\sim$400
kms$^{-1}$, the highest detected in a nearby galaxy. At the IRC, the blue-shifted broad component
displays a 90 km s$^{-1}$ bump in radial velocity distribution, a feature we previously detected
in molecular gas kinematics. The narrow component velocity dispersion ($\sim$32 kms$^{-1}$)
is within the expected for normal galaxies and LIRGs. Intermediate components (FWHM$\sim$150
kms$^{-1}$, red-shifted to NE, blue-shifted to SW) appear at some positions, as well as weaker blue
(-215 kms$^{-1}$) and red line wings (+300 kms$^{-1}$). The IRC depicts a large broad vs. narrow
line flux-ratio (F(B)/F(N)$\sim$1.35), and the broad component seems only comparable with those
observed at very high star-forming rate galaxies. The results indicate that the IRC would be the
main source of the galactic winds originated in the central region of NGC 253.
