We investigate ZTF18aalrxas, a double-peaked Type IIb core-collapse supernova (SN) discovered
during science validation of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). ZTF18aalrxas was discovered
while the optical emission was still rising towards the initial cooling peak (0.7 mag over 2 days).
Our observations consist of multi-band (UV, optical) light-curves, and optical spectra spanning
from $\approx0.7$ d to $\approx180$ d past the explosion. We use a Monte-Carlo based non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium (NLTE) model, that simultanously reproduces both the $\rm ^{56}Ni$ powered bolometric
light curve and our nebular spectrum. This model is used to constrain the synthesized radioactive
nickel mass (0.17 $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) and the total ejecta mass (1.7 $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$)
of the SN. The cooling emission is modeled using semi-analytical extended envelope models to constrain
the progenitor radius ($790-1050$ $\mathrm{R}_{\odot}$) at the time of explosion. Our nebular
spectrum shows signs of interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM), and this spetrum is
modeled and analysed to constrain the amount of ejected oxygen ($0.3-0.5$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$)
and the total hydrogen mass ($\approx0.15$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) in the envelope of the progenitor.
The oxygen mass of ZTF18aalrxas is consistent with a low ($12-13$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) Zero Age
Main Sequence mass progenitor. The light curves and spectra of ZTF18aalrxas are not consistent
with massive single star SN Type IIb progenitor models. The presence of an extended hydrogen envelope
of low mass, the presence of a dense CSM, the derived ejecta mass, and the late-time oxygen emission
can all be explained in a binary model scenario.
