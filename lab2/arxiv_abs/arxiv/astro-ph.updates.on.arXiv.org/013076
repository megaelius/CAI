Planet yield calculations may be used to inform the target selection strategy and science operations
of space observatories. Forthcoming and proposed NASA missions, such as the Wide-Field Infrared
Survey Telescope (WFIRST), the Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission (HabEx), and the Large UV/Optical/IR
Surveyor (LUVOIR), are expected to be equipped with sensitive coronagraphs and/or starshades.
We are developing a suite of numerical simulations to quantify the extent to which ground-based
radial velocity (RV) surveys could boost the detection efficiency of direct imaging missions.
In this paper, we discuss the first step in the process of estimating planet yields: generating synthetic
planetary systems consistent with observed occurrence rates from multiple detection methods.
In an attempt to self-consistently populate stars with orbiting planets, it is found that naive
extrapolation of occurrence rates (mass, semi-major axis) results in an unrealistically large
number-density of Neptune-mass planets beyond the ice-line ($a \gtrsim 5$au), causing dynamic
interactions that would destabilize orbits. We impose a stability criterion for multi-planet
systems based on mutual Hill radii separation. Considering the influence of compact configurations
containing Jovian-mass and Neptune-mass planets results in a marked suppression in the number
of terrestrial planets that can exist at large radii. This result has a pronounced impact on planet
yield calculations particularly in regions accessible to high-contrast imaging and microlensing.
The dynamically compact configurations and occurrence rates that we develop may be incorporated
as input into joint RV and direct imaging yield calculations to place meaningful limits on the number
of detectable planets with future missions.
