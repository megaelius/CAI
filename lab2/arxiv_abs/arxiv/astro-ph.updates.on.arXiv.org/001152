We present a homogeneous, detailed analysis of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of $\sim$
1700 LBGs from the GOODS-MUSIC catalog with deep multi-wavelength photometry from $U$ band to 8
$\mu$m, to determine stellar mass, age, dust attenuation and star formation rate. Using our SED
fitting tool, which takes into account nebular emission, we explore a wide parameter space. We also
explore a set of different star formation histories. Nebular emission is found to significantly
affect the determination of the physical parameters for the majority of $z \sim $ 3--6 LBGs. We identify
two populations of galaxies by determining the importance of the contribution of emission lines
to broad-band fluxes. We find that $\sim$ $65%$ of LBGs show detectable signs of emission lines,
whereas $\sim$ $35%$ show weak or no emission lines. This distribution is found over the entire redshift
range. We interpret these groups as actively star forming and more quiescent LBGs respectively.
We find that to reproduce some colors affected by strong emission lines, it is necessary to considerer
SED fits with very young ages ($<50$ Myr). Other arguments favoring episodic star formation
and relatively short star formation timescales are also discussed. Taking into account nebular
emission generally leads, for a given SFH, to a younger age, lower stellar mass, higher dust attenuation,
and higher star formation rate, although with increased uncertainties. We find a trend of increasing
dust attenuation with galaxy mass, and a large scatter in the SFR-$M_{\star}$ relation. Our analysis
yields a trend of increasing specific star formation rate with redshift, as predicted by recent
galaxy evolution models. The physical parameters of approximately two thirds of high redshift
galaxies are significantly modified when nebular emission is taken into account. [abridged]
