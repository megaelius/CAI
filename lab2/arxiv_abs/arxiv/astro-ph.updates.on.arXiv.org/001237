The two fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model - that the initial fluctuations
are statistically isotropic and Gaussian - are rigorously tested using maps of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) anisotropy from the Planck satellite. Deviations from isotropy have been found
and demonstrated to be robust against component separation algorithm, mask choice and frequency
dependence. Many of these anomalies were previously observed in the WMAP data, and are now confirmed
at similar levels of significance (about 3 sigma). However, we find little evidence for non-Gaussianity,
with the exception of a few statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies.
In particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connected to a low observed
variance of the CMB signal. A power asymmetry is now found to persist to scales corresponding to about
l=600, and can be described in the low-l regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. However,
any primordial power asymmetry is strongly scale-dependent and does not extend to arbitrarily
small angular scales. Finally, it is plausible that some of these features may be reflected in the
angular power spectrum of the data, which shows a deficit of power on similar scales. Indeed, when
the power spectra of two hemispheres defined by a preferred direction are considered separately,
one shows evidence for a deficit in power, while its opposite contains oscillations between odd
and even modes that may be related to the parity violation and phase correlations also detected in
the data. Although these analyses represent a step forward in building an understanding of the anomalies,
a satisfactory explanation based on physically motivated models is still lacking.
