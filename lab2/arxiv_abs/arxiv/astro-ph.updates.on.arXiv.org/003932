We present microlensing planet OGLE-2017-BLG-0173Lb, with planet-host mass ratio either $q\simeq
2.5\times 10^{-5}$ or $q\simeq 6.5\times 10^{-5}$, the lowest or among the lowest ever detected.
The planetary perturbation is strongly detected, $\Delta\chi^2\sim 10,000$, because it arises
from a bright (therefore, large) source passing over and enveloping the planetary caustic: a so-called
"Hollywood" event. The factor $\sim 2.5$ offset in $q$ arises because of a previously unrecognized
discrete degeneracy between Hollywood events in which the caustic is fully enveloped and those
in which only one flank is enveloped, which we dub "Cannae" and "von Schlieffen", respectively.
This degeneracy is "accidental" in that it arises from gaps in the data. Nevertheless, the fact that
it appears in a $\Delta\chi^2=10,000$ planetary anomaly is striking. We present a simple formalism
to estimate the sensitivity of other Hollywood events to planets and show that they can lead to detections
close to, but perhaps not quite reaching, the Earth/Sun mass ratio of $3\times 10^{-6}$. This formalism
also enables an analytic understanding of the factor $\sim 2.5$ offset in $q$ between the Cannae
and von Schlieffen solutions. The Bayesian estimates for the host-mass, system distance, and planet-host
projected separation are $M=0.39^{+0.40}_{-0.24}\,M_\odot$, $D_L=4.8^{+1.5}_{-1.8}\,\kpc$,
and $a_\perp=3.8\pm 1.6\,\au$. The two estimates of the planet mass are $m_p=3.3^{+3.8}_{-2.1}\,M_\oplus$
and $m_p=8^{+11}_{-6}\,M_\oplus$. The measured lens-source relative proper motion $\mu=6\,\masyr$
will permit imaging of the lens in about 15 years or at first light on adaptive-optics imagers on next-generation
telescopes. These will allow to measure the host mass but probably cannot resolve the planet-host
mass-ratio degeneracy.
