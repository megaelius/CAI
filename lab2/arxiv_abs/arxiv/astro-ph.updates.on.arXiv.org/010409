This paper presents a data processing algorithm with machine learning for polarization extraction
and event selection applied to photoelectron track images taken with X-ray polarimeters. The method
uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) classification to predict the azimuthal angle and 2-D
position of the initial photoelectron emission from a 2-D track image projected along the X-ray
incident direction. Two CNN models are demonstrated with data sets generated by a Monte Carlo simulation:
one has a commonly used loss function calculated by the cross entropy and the other has an additional
loss term to penalize nonuniformity for an unpolarized modulation curve based on the $H$-test,
which is used for periodic signal search in X-ray/$\gamma$-ray astronomy. The modulation curve
calculated by the former model with unpolarized data has several irregular features, which can
be canceled out by unfolding the angular response or simulating the detector rotation. On the other
hand, the latter model can predict a flat modulation curve with a residual systematic modulation
down to $\lesssim1$%. Both models show almost the same modulation factors and position accuracy
of less than 2 pixel (or 240 $\mu$m) for all four test energies of 2.7, 4.5, 6.4, and 8.0 keV. In addition,
event selection is performed based on probabilities from the CNN to maximize the polarization sensitivity
considering a trade-off between the modulation factor and signal acceptance. The developed method
with machine learning improves the polarization sensitivity by 10-20%, compared to that determined
with the image moment method developed previously.
