One of largest uncertainties in nuclear physics is the relation between the pressure and density
of supranuclear matter: the equation of state. Some of this uncertainty may be removed through future
gravitational wave observations of neutron star binaries by extracting the tidal deformabilities
(or Love numbers) of neutron stars. Previous studies showed that only a certain combination of the
individual deformabilities of each body (chirp tidal deformability) can be measured with second-generation
gravitational wave interferometers, such as Adv. LIGO, due to correlations between the individual
deformabilities. To overcome this, we search for approximately universal (or equation-of-state
independent) relations between two combinations of the individual tidal deformabilities, such
that once one of them has been measured, the other can be automatically obtained and the individual
ones decoupled through these relations. We find an approximately universal relation between the
symmetric and the anti-symmetric combination of the individual tidal deformabilities that is
equation-of-state-insensitive to $20\%$ for binaries with masses less than $1.7M_\odot$. We
show that these relations can be used to eliminate a combination of the tidal parameters from the
list of model parameters, thus breaking degeneracies and improving the accuracy in parameter estimation.
A simple study shows that the universal relations can improve the accuracy in the extraction of the
symmetric combination of tidal parameters by as much as an order of magnitude, making the overall
accuracy in the extraction of this parameter slightly better than that of the chirp tidal deformability.
These new universal relations and the improved measurement accuracy on tidal parameters not only
are important to astrophysics and nuclear physics, but also impact our ability to probe extreme
gravity with gravitational waves and cosmology.
