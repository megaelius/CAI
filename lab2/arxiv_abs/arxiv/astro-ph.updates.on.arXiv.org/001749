We report the detection of eight vibronic bands of C$_3$, seven of which have been hitherto unobserved
in astrophysical objects, in the translucent cloud towards HD~169454. Four of these bands are also
found towards two additional objects: HD~73882 and HD~154368. Very high signal-to-noise ratio
($\sim$1000 and higher) and high resolving power ($R=80,000$) UVES-VLT spectra (Paranal, Chile)
allow for detecting novel spectral features of C$_3$, even revealing weak perturbed features in
the strongest bands. The work presented here provides the most complete spectroscopic survey of
the so far largest carbon chain detected in translucent interstellar clouds. High-quality laboratory
spectra of C$_3$ are measured using cavity ring-down absorption spectroscopy in a supersonically
expanding hydrocarbon plasma, to support the analysis of the identified bands towards HD~169454.
A column density of N(C$_3$) = $(6.6 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ is inferred and the excitation
of the molecule exhibits two temperature components; $T_{exc}= 22 \pm 1$ K for the low-$J$ states
and $T_{exc}= 187 \pm 25$ K for the high-$J$ tail. The rotational excitation of C$_3$ is reasonably
well explained by models involving a mechanism including inelastic collisions, formation and
destruction of the molecule, and radiative pumping in the far-infrared. These models yield gas
kinetic temperatures comparable to those found for $T_{exc}$. The assignment of spectral features
in the UV-blue range 3793-4054 \AA\ may be of relevance for future studies aiming at unravelling
spectra to identify interstellar molecules associated with the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs).
