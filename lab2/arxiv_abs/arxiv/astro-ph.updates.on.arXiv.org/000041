Using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope data, we reexamine the fundamental properties (ages,
masses and extinction values) of the rich star cluster population in the dwarf starburst galaxy
NGC 5253. The gain in resolution compared to previous studies is of order a factor of two in both spatial
dimensions, while our accessible wavelength range transcends previous studies by incorporation
of both near-ultraviolet and near-infrared (IR) passbands. We apply spectral synthesis treatments
based on two different simple stellar population model suites to our set of medium-, broad-band
and H-alpha images to gain an improved physical understanding of the IR-excess flux found for a subset
of young clusters (30 of 149). With the caveat that our models are based on fully sampled stellar mass
functions, the NGC 5253 cluster population is dominated by a significant number of relatively low-mass
(M_cl <= a few 10^4 Msun) objects with ages ranging from a few x 10^6 to a few x 10^7 yr, which is in
excellent agreement with the starburst age of the host galaxy. The IR-excess clusters are almost
all found in this young age range and have masses of up to a few x 10^4 Msun. The IR excess in the relatively
low-mass NGC 5253 clusters is most likely caused by a combination of stochastic sampling effects
and colour variations due to the presence of either luminous red or pre-main-sequence stars. We
also find a small number of intermediate-age (~ 1 Gyr-old), ~10^5 Msun clusters, as well as up to a
dozen massive, ~10 Gyr-old globular clusters. Their presence supports the notion that NGC 5253
is a very active galaxy that has undergone multiple episodes of star cluster formation.
