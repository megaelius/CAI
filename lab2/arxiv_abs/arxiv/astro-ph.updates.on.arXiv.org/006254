We present the analysis of planetary microlensing event MOA-2011-BLG-291, which has a mass ratio
of $q=(3.8\pm0.7)\times10^{-4}$ and a source star that is redder (or brighter) than the bulge main
sequence. This event is located at a low Galactic latitude in the survey area that is currently planned
for NASA's WFIRST exoplanet microlensing survey. This unusual color for a microlensed source star
implies that we cannot assume that the source star is in the Galactic bulge. The favored interpretation
is that the source star is a lower main sequence star at a distance of $D_S=4.9\pm1.3\,$kpc in the
Galactic disk. However, the source could also be a turn-off star on the far side of the bulge or a sub-giant
in the far side of the Galactic disk if it experiences significantly more reddening than the bulge
red clump stars. However, these possibilities have only a small effect on our mass estimates for
the host star and planet. We find host star and planet masses of $M_{\rm host} =0.15^{+0.27}_{-0.10}M_\odot$
and $m_p=18^{+34}_{-12}M_\oplus$ from a Bayesian analysis with a standard Galactic model under
the assumption that the planet hosting probability does not depend on the host mass or distance.
However, if we attempt to measure the host and planet masses with host star brightness measurements
from high angular resolution follow-up imaging, the implied masses will be sensitive to the host
star distance. The WFIRST exoplanet microlensing survey is expected to use this method to determine
the masses for many of the planetary systems that it discovers, so this issue has important design
implications for the WFIRST exoplanet microlensing survey.
