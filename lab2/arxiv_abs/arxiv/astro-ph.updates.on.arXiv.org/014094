We present the results of a detailed investigation into the physical conditions in interstellar
material interacting with the supernova remnant IC 443. Our analysis is based on a comprehensive
examination of high-resolution far-ultraviolet spectra obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging
Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope of two stars behind IC 443. One of our targets (HD
43582) probes gas along the entire line of sight through the supernova remnant, while the other (HD
254755) samples material located ahead of the primary supernova shock front. We identify low velocity
quiescent gas in both directions and find that the densities and temperatures in these components
are typical of diffuse atomic and molecular clouds. Numerous high velocity components are observed
in the absorption profiles of neutral and singly-ionized atomic species toward HD 43582. These
components exhibit a combination of greatly enhanced thermal pressures and significantly reduced
dust-grain depletions. We interpret this material as cooling gas in a recombination zone far downstream
from shocks driven into neutral gas clumps. The pressures derived for a group of ionized gas components
at high positive velocity toward HD 43582 are lower than those of the other shocked components, pointing
to pressure inhomogeneities across the remnant. A strong very high velocity component near -620
km/s is seen in the absorption profiles of highly-ionized species toward HD 43582. The velocity
of this material is consistent with the range of shock velocities implied by observations of soft
thermal X-ray emission from IC 443. Moderately high-velocity gas toward HD 254755 may represent
shocked material from a separate foreground supernova remnant.
