The first high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of the planetary nebula BD+30$^\circ$3639 allowed
to study X-ray emitting "hot bubbles" (HBs) of planetary nebulae in unprecedented detail. We investigate
(i) how diagnostic line ratios are affected by the HB thermal structure and chemical profile, (ii)
if the HB chemical composition of BD+30$^\circ$3639 is consistent with the H-poor (H for hydrogen)
composition of the stellar photosphere, and (iii) if H-rich nebular matter has been added to this
HB by evaporation. We apply an analytical, 1D model for wind-blown HBs with temperature and density
profiles based on self-similar solutions including thermal conduction. We construct heat-conduction
HBs with chemical stratification. The X-ray emission is computed using the CHIANTI code. Our HB
models are used to re-analyse the high-resolution X-ray spectrum of BD+30$^\circ$3639. Our models
reproduce the observed line ratios much better than plasmas with single electron temperatures.
All the temperature- and abundance-sensitive line ratios are consistent with BD+30$^\circ$3639
X-ray observations for (i) an intervening column density of neutral H, $N_{\rm H} = 0.20_{-0.10}^{+0.05}\times\!10^{22}\rm\
cm^{-2}$, (ii) a characteristic HB X-ray temperature of ${T_{\rm X} = 1.8\pm 0.1~ }$MK together
with (iii) a very high neon mass fraction of about 0.05, virtually as high as that of oxygen. For lower
values of $N_{\rm H}$, we cannot exclude that the HB of BD+30$^\circ$3639 contains a small amount
of evaporated (or mixed) H-rich nebular matter. Given the possible range of $N_{\rm H}$, the fraction
of evaporated H-rich matter cannot exceed 3% of the HB mass. The diffuse X-ray emission from BD+30$^\circ$3639
can well be explained by models of wind-blown HBs with thermal conduction and a chemical composition
equal to that of the H-poor and carbon-, oxygen-, and neon-rich stellar surface.
