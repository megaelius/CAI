The differences between the inherent stellar populations (SPs) of LAEs and LBGs are a key factor
in understanding early galaxy formation and evolution. We have run a set of SP burst-like models
for a sample of 1,558 sources at $3.4<z<6.8$ from the Survey for High-$z$ Absorption Red and Dead
Sources (SHARDS) over the GOODS-N field. This work focuses on the differences between the three
different observational subfamilies of our sample: LAE-LBGs, no-Ly$\alpha$ LBGs and pure LAEs.
Single and double SP synthetic spectra were used to model the SEDs, adopting a Bayesian information
criterion to analyse under which situations a second SP is required. We find that the sources are
well modelled using a single SP in $\sim79\%$ of the cases. The best models suggest that pure LAEs
are typically young low mass galaxies ($t\sim26^{+41}_{-25}$ Myr; $M_{\mathrm{star}}\sim5.6^{+12.0}_{-5.5}\times10^{8}\
M_{\odot}$), undergoing one of their first bursts of star formation. On the other hand, no-Ly$\alpha$
LBGs require older SPs ($t\sim71\pm12$ Myr), and they are substantially more massive ($M_{\mathrm{star}}\sim3.5\pm1.1\times10^{9}\
M_{\odot}$). LAE-LBGs appear as the subgroup that more frequently needs the addition of a second
SP, representing an old and massive galaxy caught in a strong recent star-forming episode. The relative
number of sources found from each subfamily at each $z$ supports an evolutionary scenario from pure
LAEs and single SP LAE-LBGs to more massive LBGs. Stellar Mass Functions are also derived, finding
an increase of $M^{*}$ with cosmic time and a possible steepening of the low mass slope from $z\sim6$
to $z\sim5$ with no significant change to $z\sim4$. Additionally, we have derived the SFR-$M_{\mathrm{star}}$
relation, finding a $\mathrm{SFR}\propto M_{\mathrm{star}}^{\beta}$ behaviour with negligible
evolution from $z\sim4$ to $z\sim6$.
