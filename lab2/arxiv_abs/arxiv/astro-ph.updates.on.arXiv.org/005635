We have measured the root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude of intensity fluctuations, $\Delta I$,
in plume and interplume regions of a polar coronal hole. These intensity fluctuations correspond
to density fluctuations. Using data from the \rev{Sun Watcher using Active Pixel System detector
and Image Processing} (SWAP) on \textit{Project for Onboard Autonomy (Proba2)}, our results extend
up to a height of about 1.35~$R_{\sun}$. One advantage of the RMS analysis is that it does not rely
on a detailed evaluation of the power spectrum, which is limited by noise levels to low heights in
the corona. The RMS approach can be performed up to larger heights where the noise level is greater,
provided that the noise itself can be quantified. At low heights, both the absolute $\Delta I$, and
the amplitude relative to the mean intensity, $\Delta I/I$, decrease with height. However, starting
at about 1.2~$R_{\sun}$ $\Delta I/I$ increases, reaching 20--40\% by 1.35~$R_{\sun}$. This corresponds
to density fluctuations of $\Delta n_{\mathrm{e}}/n_{\mathrm{e}} \approx$~10--20\%. The increasing
relative amplitude implies that the density fluctuations are generated in the corona itself. One
possibility is that the density fluctuations are generated by an instability of Alfv\'en waves.
This generation mechanism is consistent with some theoretical models and with observations of
Alfv\'en wave amplitudes in coronal holes. Although we find that the energy of the observed density
fluctuations is small, these fluctuations are likely to play an important indirect role in coronal
heating by promoting the reflection of Alfv\'en waves and driving turbulence.
