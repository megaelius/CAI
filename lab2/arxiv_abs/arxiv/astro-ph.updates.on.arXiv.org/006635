A major science goal of future, large-aperture, optical space telescopes is to directly image and
spectroscopically analyze reflected light from potentially habitable exoplanets. To accomplish
this, the optical system must suppress diffracted light from the star to reveal point sources approximately
ten orders of magnitude fainter than the host star at small angular separation. Coronagraphs with
microdot apodizers achieve the theoretical performance needed to image Earth-like planets with
a range of possible telescope designs, including those with obscured and segmented pupils. A test
microdot apodizer with various bulk patterns (step functions, gradients, and sinusoids) and 4
different dot sizes (3, 5, 7, and 10 $\mu$m) made of small chrome squares on anti-reflective glass
was characterized with microscopy, optical laser interferometry, as well as transmission and
reflectance measurements at wavelengths of 600 and 800 nm. Microscopy revealed the microdots were
fabricated to high precision. Results from laser interferometry showed that the phase shifts observed
in reflection vary with the local microdot fill factor. Transmission measurements showed that
microdot fill factor and transmission were linearly related for dot sizes >5 $\mu$m. However, anomalously
high transmittance was measured when the dot size is <5x the wavelength and the fill factor is approximately
50%, where the microdot pattern becomes periodic. The transmission excess is not as prominent in
the case of larger dot sizes suggesting that it is likely to be caused by the interaction between the
incident field and electronic resonances in the surface of the metallic microdots. We used our empirical
models of the microdot apodizers to optimize a second generation of reflective apodizer designs
and confirmed that the amplitude and phase of the reflected beam closely matches the ideal wavefront.
