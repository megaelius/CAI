Forecast of the atmospheric parameters and optical turbulence applied to the ground-based astronomy
is very crucial mainly for the queue scheduling. So far, most efforts have been addressed by our group
in developing algorithms for the optical turbulence (CN2) and annexed integrated astroclimatic
parameters and quantifying the performances of the Astro-Meso-Nh package in reconstructing such
parameters. Besides, intensive analyses on the Meso-Nh performances= in reconstructing atmospheric
parameters relevant for the ground-based astronomy has been carried out. Our studies referred
always to the night time regime. To extend the applications of our studies to the day time regime,
we present, in this contribution, preliminary results obtained by comparing model outputs and
measurements of classical atmospheric parameter relevant for the ground-based astronomy in night
and day time. We chose as a test case, the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory (Canary Islands), that
offers a very extended set of measurements provided by different sensors belonging to different
telescopes on the same summit/Observatory. The convective regime close to the ground typical of
the day time is pretty different from the stable regime characterising the night time. This study
aims therefore to enlarge the domain of validity of the Astro-Meso-Nh code to new turbulence regimes
and it permits to cover the total 24 hours of a day. Such an approach will permit not only an application
to solar telescopes (e.g. EST) but also applications to a much extended set of scientific fields,
not only in astronomical context such as satellite communications.
