Statistical dependencies among features of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), solar flares, and sigmoidal
structures in soft-X-ray images were investigated. We applied analysis methods to all the features
in the same way in order to investigate the reproducibility of the correlations among them, which
may be found from the combination of previous statistical studies. The samples of 211 M-class and
X-class flares, which were observed between 2006 and 2015 by Hinode/X-ray telescope, Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory/Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph, and GOES, were examined
statistically. Five kinds of analysis were performed: Occurrence rate analysis, linear-correlation
analysis, association analysis, the Kolmogorov--Smirnov test, and Anderson-Darling test. The
analyses show three main results. First, the sigmoidal structure and long duration events (LDEs)
has stronger dependency on the CME occurrence than large X-ray class events in on-disk events. Second,
for the limb events, the significant dependency exists between LDEs and CME occurrence, and between
X-ray class and CME occurrence. Third, there existed 32.4% of on-disk flare events, which had sigmoidal
structure and were not accompanied by CMEs. However, the occurrence probability of CMEs without
sigmoidal structures is very small, 8.8 %, in on-disk events. While the first and second results
are consistent with previous studies, we newly provided the difference between the on-disk events
and limb events. The third result that non-sigmoidal regions produce less eruptive events is also
different from previous results. We suggest that sigmoidal structures in soft X-ray images will
be a helpful feature for CME prediction regarding on-disk flare events.
