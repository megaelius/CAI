In order to improve our understanding of the kinetics of the cometary coma, theoretical studies
of the major reactive collisions in these environments are needed. Deep in the collisional coma,
inelastic collisions between thermal electrons and molecular ions result in recombination and
vibrational excitation, the rates of these processes being particularly elevated due to the high
charged particle densities in the inner region. This work addresses the dissociative recombination,
vibrational excitation, and vibrational de-excitation of electrons with CO$^+$ molecular cations.
The aim of this study is to understand the importance of these reactive collisions in producing carbon
and oxygen atoms in cometary activity. The cross-section calculations were based on Multichannel
Quantum Defect Theory. The molecular data sets, used here to take into account the nuclear dynamics,
were based on ab initio R-matrix approach. The cross sections for the dissociative recombination,
vibrational excitation, and vibrational de-excitation processes, for the six lowest vibrational
levels of CO$^+$ - relevant for the electronic temperatures observed in comets - are computed, as
well as their corresponding Maxwell rate coefficients. Moreover, final state distributions for
different dissociation pathways are presented. Among all reactive collisions taking place between
low-energy electrons and CO$^+$, the dissociative recombination is the most important process
at electronic temperatures characterizing the comets. We have shown that this process can be a major
source of O($^3$P), O($^1$D), O($^1$S), C($^3$P) and C($^1$D) produced in the cometary coma at
small cometocentric distances.
