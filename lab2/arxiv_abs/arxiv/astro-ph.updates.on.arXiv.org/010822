Transient neutron star (NS) LMXBs undergo episodes of accretion, alternated with quiescent periods.
During an accretion outburst, the NS heats up due to exothermic accretion-induced processes taking
place in the crust. Besides the long-known deep crustal heating of nuclear origin, a likely non-nuclear
source of heat, dubbed 'shallow heating', is present at lower densities. Most of the accretion-induced
heat slowly diffuses into the core on a timescale of years. Over many outburst cycles, a state of equilibrium
is reached when the core temperature is high enough that the heating and cooling (photon and neutrino
emission) processes are in balance. We investigate how stellar characteristics and outburst properties
affect the long-term temperature evolution of a transiently accreting NS. For the first time the
effects of crustal properties are considered, particularly that of shallow heating. Using our
code NSCool, we tracked the thermal evolution of a NS undergoing outbursts over a period of $10^5$
yr. The outburst sequence is based on the regular outbursts observed from Aql X-1. For each model,
we calculated the timescale over which equilibrium was reached and we present these timescales
along with the temperature and luminosity parameters of the equilibrium state. We find that shallow
heating significantly contributes to the equilibrium state. Increasing its strength raises the
equilibrium core temperature. We find that if deep crustal heating is replaced by shallow heating
alone, the core would still heat up, reaching only a 2% lower equilibrium core temperature. Deep
crustal heating may therefore not be vital to the heating of the core. Additionally, shallow heating
can increase the quiescent luminosity to values higher than previously expected.
