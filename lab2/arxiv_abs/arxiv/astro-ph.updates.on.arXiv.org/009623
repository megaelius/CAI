The orbital period distribution of close binary stars consisting of a white dwarf and a main-sequence
star (WDMS) is a powerful observational constraint on population synthesis models of the poorly
understood common-envelope (CE) interaction. Models have often struggled to reproduce the small
number of post-CE WDMS binaries with anomalously long orbital periods greater than $\sim$4 d, though
recent studies suggest that in longer period systems recombination energy may help contribute
to the efficient ejection of the CE. Planetary nebulae (PNe) are an emerging source of rare long period
post-CE binaries which can act as powerful complementary constraints on population synthesis
models to more traditional post-CE binary populations. A tentative 9.0 d orbital period was recently
proposed for the central star of the PN IC~4776, potentially one of the longest periods observed
in post-CE WDMS binaries. Here we present SALT HRS observations of IC~4776 that rule out a 9.0 d orbital
period, as well as the previously suggested Wolf-Rayet classification of the primary. The SALT
HRS data establish a 3.11 d orbital period and rule out Of and Wolf-Rayet primary spectral types.
Assuming a mass of 0.6 $M_\odot$ for the primary and an orbital inclination matching the nebula orientation,
we find a companion mass of $0.22\pm0.03$ $M_\odot$, most likely corresponding to an M4V companion.
The orbital period of IC~4776 is still consistent with findings of abundance discrepancy factor
(ADF) studies of post-CE PNe, but any trends in the ADF distribution derived from the sample remain
significantly biased by selection effects.
