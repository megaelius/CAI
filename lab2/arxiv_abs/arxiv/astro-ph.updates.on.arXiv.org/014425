We study the impact of accretion from protoplanetary discs on stellar evolution of AFG-type stars.
We use a simplified disc model computed using the Two-Pop-Py code that contains the growth and drift
of dust particles in the protoplanetary disc. It is used to model the accretion scenarios for a range
of physical conditions of protoplanetary discs. Two limiting cases are combined with the evolution
of stellar convective envelopes computed using the Garstec stellar evolution code. We find that
the accretion of metal-poor (gas) or metal-rich (dust) material has a significant impact on the
chemical composition of the stellar convective envelope. As a consequence, the evolutionary track
of the star diverts from the standard scenario predicted by canonical stellar evolution models,
which assume a constant and homogeneous chemical composition after the assembly of the star has
finished. In the case of the Sun, we find a modest impact on the solar chemical composition. Accretion
of metal-poor material indeed reduces the overall metallicity of the solar atmosphere, and it is
consistent, within the uncertainty, with the solar Z reported by Caffau et al. (2011), but our model
is not consistent with the measurement by Asplund et al. (2009). Another effect is the change of the
position of the star in the colour-magnitude diagram. We compare our predictions to a set of open
clusters from the Gaia DR2 and show that it is possible to produce a scatter close to the turn-off of
young clusters that could contribute to explain the observed scatter in CMDs. Detailed measurements
of metallicities and abundances in the nearby open clusters will provide a stringent observational
test of our proposed scenario.
