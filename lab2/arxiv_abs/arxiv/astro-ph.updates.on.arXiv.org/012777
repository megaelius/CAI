The occurrence rate of long-period giant planets around young stars is highly uncertain since it
is not only governed by the protoplanetary disc structure and planet formation process, but also
reflects dynamical re-structuring processes after planet formation as well as possible capture
of planets not formed in-situ. Direct imaging is currently the only feasible method to detect such
wide-orbit planets and constrain their occurrence rate. We carry out a large L'-band high-contrast
direct imaging survey for giant planets around young stars with protoplanetary or debris discs
using the NACO instrument at the ESO Very Large Telescope on Cerro Paranal in Chile. We use very deep
angular differential imaging observations with typically >60 deg field rotation, and employ a
vector vortex coronagraph where feasible to achieve the best possible point source sensitivity
down to an inner working angle of about 100mas. This paper introduces our NACO Imaging Survey for
Planets around Young stars ("NACO-ISPY"), its goals and strategy, the target list, and data reduction
scheme, and presents preliminary results from the first 2.5 survey years. We achieve a mean 5 sigma
L' contrast of 6.4mag at 150mas and a background limit of 16.5mag at >1.5". Our detection probability
is >50\% for companions with 8\,M$_{\rm Jup}$\ at semi-major axes 80-200au. It thus compares well
to the detection space of other state-of-the-art high-contrast imaging surveys. We have contributed
to the characterisation of two new planets originally discovered by VLT/SPHERE, but we have not
yet independently discovered new planets around any of our target stars. We report the discovery
of close-in low-mass stellar companions around four young stars and show L'-band scattered light
images of the discs around eleven stars, six of which have never been imaged at L'-band before.
