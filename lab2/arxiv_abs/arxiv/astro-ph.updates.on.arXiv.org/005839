Understanding the formation of massive stars is one of the unsolved problems in modern astronomy.
The main difficulty is that the intense radiation from the high-luminosity stars and the thermal
pressure from the resulting ionized gas (both insignificant for low-mass stars) may be able to reverse
the accretion flow and prevent the star from accreting fresh material. Such feedback effects can
naturally be mitigated if accretion proceeds through discs, which is the established mechanism
to form sun-like stars. However, recent 3D MHD simulations have shown that accretion on 1000 au scales
is through filaments rather than a large disc. This theoretical prediction has never been confirmed
via observations owing to the poor linear resolution of previous studies (>1000 au). Here we present
the first observational evidence that mass assembly in young high-mass stars forming in protoclusters
is predominantly asymmetric and disordered. In particular, we observed the innermost regions
around three deeply embedded high-mass protostars with very high spatial resolution (~100 au).
We identified multiple massive (several solar masses), warm (50-150 Kelvin) filamentary streamers
pointing onto the central sources, which we interpret as multi-directional accretion channels.
These structures inhibit the formation of a large, steady disc. Nevertheless, the identification
of fast collimated outflows in the three observed systems indicates that (non-steady) compact
discs may be present (we measure upper limits on their radii of <80 for one object and <350 astronomical
units for the remaining two objects). Our finding contrasts with the simplified classic paradigm
of an ordered (and stable) disc/jet system and provides an experimental confirmation of a multi-directional
and unsteady accretion model for massive star formation supported by recent 3D (magneto)hydrodynamic
simulations.
