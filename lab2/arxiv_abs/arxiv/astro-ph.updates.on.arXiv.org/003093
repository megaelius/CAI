Wide-angle photometric surveys of previously uncharted sky areas or wavelength regimes will always
bring in unexpected sources whose existence and properties cannot be easily predicted from earlier
observations: novelties or even anomalies. Such objects can be efficiently sought for with novelty
detection algorithms. Here we present an application of such a method, called one-class support
vector machines (OCSVM), to search for anomalous patterns among sources preselected from the mid-infrared
AllWISE catalogue covering the whole sky. To create a model of expected data we train the algorithm
on a set of objects with spectroscopic identifications from the SDSS DR13 database, present also
in AllWISE. OCSVM detects as anomalous those sources whose patterns - WISE photometric measurements
in this case - are inconsistent with the model. Among the detected anomalies we find artefacts, such
as objects with spurious photometry due to blending, but most importantly also real sources of genuine
astrophysical interest. Among the latter, OCSVM has identified a sample of heavily reddened AGN/quasar
candidates distributed uniformly over the sky and in a large part absent from other WISE-based AGN
catalogues. It also allowed us to find a specific group of sources of mixed types, mostly stars and
compact galaxies. By combining the semi-supervised OCSVM algorithm with standard classification
methods it will be possible to improve the latter by accounting for sources which are not present
in the training sample but are otherwise well-represented in the target set. Anomaly detection
adds flexibility to automated source separation procedures and helps verify the reliability and
representativeness of the training samples. It should be thus considered as an essential step in
supervised classification schemes to ensure completeness and purity of produced catalogues.
