The absence of thermal instability in the high/soft state of black hole X-ray binaries, in disagreement
with the standard thin disk theory, is a long-standing riddle for theoretical astronomers. We have
tried to resolve this question by studying the thermal stability of a thin disk with magnetically
driven winds in the $\dot{M}- \Sigma$ plane. It is found that disk winds can greatly decrease the
disk temperature and thus help the disk become more stable at a given accretion rate. The critical
accretion rate $\dot{M}_{\rm crit}$ corresponding to the thermal instability threshold is increased
significantly in the presence of disk winds. For $\alpha=0.01$ and $B_{\rm \phi}=10B_{\rm _p}$,
the disk is quite stable even for a very weak initial poloidal magnetic field [$\beta_{\rm p,0}\sim
2000, \beta_{\rm p}=(P_{\rm {gas}}+P_{\rm rad})/(B_{\rm p}^2/8\pi)$]. But when $B_{\rm \phi}=B_{\rm
_p}$ or $B_{\rm \phi}=0.1B_{\rm _p}$, a somewhat stronger (but still weak) field ($\beta_{\rm
p,0}\sim 200$ or $\beta_{\rm p,0}\sim 20$) is required to make the disk stable. Nevertheless, despite
the great increase of $\dot{M}_{\rm crit}$, the luminosity threshold corresponding to instability
remains almost constant or even decreases slowly with increasing $\dot{M}_{\rm crit}$ due to the
decrease of gas temperature. The advection and diffusion timescales of the large-scale magnetic
field threading the disk are also investigated in this work. We find that the advection timescale
can be smaller than the diffusion timescale in a disk with winds, because the disk winds take away
most of the gravitational energy released in the disk, resulting in the decrease of the magnetic
diffusivity $\eta$ and the increase of the diffusion timescale.
