We investigate the nature and evolution of substructure within the SSA22 protocluster region at
$z=3.09$ using cosmological simulations. A redshift histogram constructed from current spectroscopic
observations of the SSA22 protocluster reveals two separate peaks at $z = 3.065$ (blue) and $z = 3.095$
(red). Based on these data, we report updated overdensity and mass calculations for the SSA22 protocluster.
We find $\delta_{b,gal}=4.8 \pm 1.8$, $\delta_{r,gal}=9.5 \pm 2.0$ for the blue and red peaks,
respectively, and $\delta_{t,gal}=7.6\pm 1.4$ for the entire region. These overdensities correspond
to masses of $M_b = (0.76 \pm 0.17) \times 10^{15} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, $M_r = (2.15 \pm 0.32) \times
10^{15} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, and $M_t=(3.19 \pm 0.40) \times 10^{15} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ for the red,
blue, and total peaks, respectively. We use the Small MultiDark Planck (SMDPL) simulation to identify
comparably massive $z\sim 3$ protoclusters, and uncover the underlying structure and ultimate
fate of the SSA22 protocluster. For this analysis, we construct mock redshift histograms for each
simulated $z\sim 3$ protocluster, quantitatively comparing them with the observed SSA22 data.
We find that the observed double-peaked substructure in the SSA22 redshift histogram corresponds
not to a single coalescing cluster, but rather the proximity of a $\sim 10^{15}h^{-1} M_{\odot}$
protocluster and at least one $>10^{14} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ cluster progenitor. Such associations
in the SMDPL simulation are easily understood within the framework of hierarchical clustering
of dark matter halos. We finally find that the opportunity to observe such a phenomenon is incredibly
rare, with an occurrence rate of $8h^3 \mbox{ Gpc}^{-3}$.
