Solar flare X-ray emission results from rapidly increasing temperatures and emission measures
in flaring active region loops. To date, observations from the X-Ray Sensor (XRS) onboard the Geostationary
Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) have been used to derive these properties, but have
been limited by a number of factors, including the lack of a consistent background subtraction method
capable of being automatically applied to large numbers of flares. In this paper, we describe an
automated temperature and emission measure-based background subtraction method (TEBBS), which
builds on the methods of Bornmann (1990). Our algorithm ensures that the derived temperature is
always greater than the instrumental limit and the pre-flare background temperature, and that
the temperature and emission measure are increasing during the flare rise phase. Additionally,
TEBBS utilizes the improved estimates of GOES temperatures and emission measures from White et
al. (2005). TEBBS was successfully applied to over 50,000 solar flares occurring over nearly three
solar cycles (1980-2007), and used to create an extensive catalog of the solar flare thermal properties.
We confirm that the peak emission measure and total radiative losses scale with background subtracted
GOES X-ray flux as power-laws, while the peak temperature scales logarithmically. As expected,
the peak emission measure shows an increasing trend with peak temperature, although the total radiative
losses do not. While these results are comparable to previous studies, we find that flares of a given
GOES class have lower peak temperatures and higher peak emission measures than previously reported.
The resulting TEBBS database of thermal flare plasma properties is publicly available on Solar
Monitor (www.solarmonitor.org/TEBBS/) and will be available on Heliophysics Integrated Observatory
(www.helio-vo.eu).
