This study aims to provide further evidence for the potential influence of the global solar magnetic
field on localised chromospheric jets, the macrospicules (MS). To find a connection between the
long-term variation of properties of MS and other solar activity proxies, including e.g. the temporal
variation of the frequency shift of solar global oscillations, sunspot area, etc., a database overarching
seven years of observations was built up. This database contains 362 MS, based on observations at
the 30.4 nm of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).
Three of the five investigated physical properties of MS show a clear long-term temporal variation
after smoothing the raw data. Wavelet analysis of the temporal variation of maximum length, maximum
area and average velocity is carried out. The results reveal a strong pattern of periodicities at
around 2-year (also referred to as Quasi-Biennial Oscillations -- QBOs). Comparison to solar activity
proxies, that also possess the properties of QBOs, provides some interesting features: the minima
and maxima of QBOs of MS properties occur at around the same epoch as the minima and maxima of these
activity proxies. For most of the time span investigated, the oscillations are out-of-phase. This
out-of-phase behaviour was also corroborated by a cross-correlation analysis. These results
suggest that the physical processes, that generate and drive the long-term evolution of the global
solar activity proxies, may be coupled to the short-term local physical processes driving the macrospicules,
and, therefore modulate the properties of local dynamics.
