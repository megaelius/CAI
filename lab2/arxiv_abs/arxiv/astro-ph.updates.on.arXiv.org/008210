Large-scale radio continuum surveys provide data to get insights into the physical properties
of radio sources. HII regions are prominent radio sources produced by thermal emission of ionised
gas around young massive stars. We identify and analyse HII regions in the Sino-German 6cm polarisation
survey of the Galactic plane. Objects with flat radio continuum spectra together with infrared
and/or Halpha emission are identified to be HII regions. For HII regions with small apparent sizes,
we cross-matched the 6cm small-diameter source catalogue with the radio HII region catalogue compiled
by Paladini and the infrared HII region catalogue based on the WISE data. Extended HII regions were
identified by overlaying the Paladini and the WISE HII regions onto the 6cm survey images for coincidences
by eye. The TT-plot method was employed for spectral index verification. 401 HII regions were identified
and their flux densities were determined with the Sino-German 6cm survey data. In the surveyed area,
76 pairs of sources are found to be duplicated in the Paladini HII region catalogue mainly due to the
non-distinction of previous observations with different angular resolutions, and 78 objects
in their catalogue are misclassified as HII regions, being actually planetary nebulae, supernova
remnants or extragalactic sources that have steep spectra. More than 30 HII regions and HII region
candidates from our 6cm survey data, especially extended ones, do not have counterparts in the WISE
HII region catalogue, among which 9 are identified for the first time. Based on the newly derived
radio continuum spectra and the evidence of infrared emission, the previously identified SNRs
G11.1-1.0, G20.4+0.1 and G16.4-0.5 are believed to be HII regions.
