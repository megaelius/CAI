Transitional discs have central regions characterised by significant depletion of both dust and
gas compared to younger, optically-thick discs. However, gas and dust are not depleted by equal
amounts: gas surface densities are typically reduced by factors of $\sim 100$, but small dust grains
are sometimes depleted by far larger factors, to the point of being undetectable. While this extreme
dust depletion is often attributed to planet formation, in this paper we show that another physical
mechanism is possible: expulsion of grains from the disc by radiation pressure. We explore this
mechanism using 2D simulations of dust dynamics, simultaneously solving the equation of radiative
transfer with the evolution equations for dust diffusion and advection under the combined effects
of stellar radiation and hydrodynamic interaction with a turbulent, accreting background gas
disc. We show that, in transition discs that are depleted in both gas and dust fraction by factors
of $\sim 100-1000$ compared to minimum mass Solar nebular values, and where the ratio of accretion
rate to stellar luminosity is low ($\dot{M}/L \lesssim 10^{-10}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ $L_\odot^{-1}$),
radiative clearing of any remaining $\sim 0.5$ $\mu$m and larger grains is both rapid and inevitable.
The process is size-dependent, with smaller grains removed fastest and larger ones persisting
for longer times. Our proposed mechanism thus naturally explains the extreme depletion of small
grains commonly-found in transition discs. We further suggest that the dependence of this mechanism
on grain size and optical properties may explain some of the unusual grain properties recently discovered
in a number of transition discs. The simulation code we develop is freely available.
