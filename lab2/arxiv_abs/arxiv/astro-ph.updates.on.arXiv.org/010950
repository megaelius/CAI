We present 0.25 arcsec resolution (35 au) ALMA 1.3 mm dust polarization observations for 37 young
stellar objects (YSOs) in the Ophiuchus cloud. These data encompass all the embedded protostars
in the cloud and several Flat and Class II objects to produce the largest, homogeneous study of dust
polarization on disk scales to date. The goal of this study is to study dust polarization down to disk
scales. We find that 14/37 (38%) of the YSOs are detected in polarization. Nine of these sources have
uniform polarization angles and four sources have azimuthal polarization. The sources with uniform
polarization tend to have steeper inclinations (> 60 degree) than those with azimuthal polarization
(< 60 degree). The majority (9/14) of the detected sources have polarization morphologies and disk
properties consistent with dust self-scattering in optically thick disks. The remaining sources
may be instead tracing magnetic fields. Their inferred field directions from rotating the polarization
vectors by 90 degree are mainly poloidal or hourglass shaped. We find no evidence of a strong toroidal
field component toward any of our disks. For the 23 YSOs that are undetected in polarization, roughly
half of them have 3-sigma upper limits of < 2%. These sources also tend to have inclinations < 60 degree
and they are generally compact. Since lower inclination sources tend to have azimuthal polarization,
these YSOs may be undetected in polarization due to unresolved polarization structure within our
beam. We propose that disks with inclinations > 60 degree are the best candidates for future polarization
studies of dust self-scattering as these systems will generally show uniform polarization vectors
that do not require very high resolution to resolve. We release the continuum and polarization images
for all the sources with this publication. Data from the entire survey can be obtained from Dataverse.
