We discuss a solar dynamo model of Tayler-Spruit type whose Omega-effect is conventionally produced
by a solar-like differential rotation but whose alpha-effect is assumed to be periodically modulated
by planetary tidal forcing. This resonance-like effect has its rationale in the tendency of the
current-driven Tayler instability to undergo intrinsic helicity oscillations which, in turn,
can be synchronized by periodic tidal perturbations. Specifically, we focus on the 11.07 years
alignment periodicity of the tidally dominant planets Venus, Earth, and Jupiter, whose persistent
synchronization with the solar dynamo is briefly touched upon. The typically emerging dynamo modes
are dipolar fields, oscillating with a 22.14 years period or pulsating with a 11.07 years period,
but also quadrupolar fields with corresponding periodicities. In the absence of any constant part
of alpha, we prove the subcritical nature of this Tayler-Spruit type dynamo. The resulting amplitude
of the alpha oscillation that is required for dynamo action turns out to lie in the order of 1 m/s, which
seems not implausible for the sun. When starting with a more classical, non-periodic part of alpha,
even less of the oscillatory alpha part is needed to synchronize the entire dynamo. Typically, the
dipole solutions show butterfly diagrams, although their shapes are not convincing yet. Phase
coherent transitions between dipoles and quadrupoles, which are reminiscent of the observed behaviour
during the Maunder minimum, can be easily triggered by long-term variations of dynamo parameters,
but may also occur spontaneously even for fixed parameters. Further interesting features of the
model are the typical second intensity peak and the intermittent appearance of reversed helicities
in both hemispheres.
