We present very faint dropout galaxies at z~6-9 with a stellar mass M* down to M*~10^6Mo that are found
in deep optical/near-infrared (NIR) images of the full data sets of the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF)
program in conjunction with deep ground-based and Spitzer images and gravitational lensing magnification
effects. We investigate stellar populations of the HFF dropout galaxies with the optical/NIR photometry
and BEAGLE models made of self-consistent stellar population synthesis and photoionization models,
carefully including strong nebular emission impacting on the photometry. We identify 357 galaxies
with M*~10^6-10^9Mo, and find that a stellar mass to UV luminosity L_UV ratio M*/L_UV is nearly constant
at M*~10^6-10^9Mo. Our best-estimate M*/L_UV function is comparable to a model of star-formation
duration time of 100 Myr, but 2-7 times higher than the one of 10 Myr assumed in a previous study (at
the 5sigma level) that would probably underestimate M* of faint galaxies. We derive the galaxy stellar
mass functions (GSMFs) at z~6-9 that agree with those obtained by previous studies with no M*/L_UV
assumptions at M*>~10^8Mo, and that extends to M*~10^6Mo. Estimating the stellar mass densities
rho* with the GSMFs, we find that rho* smoothly increases from log(rho*/[Mo Mpc^(-3)])=5.91 +0.75/-0.65
at z~9 to 6.21 +0.39/-0.37 at z~6-7, which is consistent with the one estimated from star-formation
rate density measurements. In conjunction with the estimates of the galaxy effective radii R_e
on the source plane, we have pinpointed two objects with low stellar masses (M*<=10^7Mo) and very
compact morphologies (R_e<=40 physical pc) that are comparable with those of globular clusters
(GCs) in the Milky Way today. These objects are candidates of star clusters that should be a part or
a dominant component of high-redshift low-mass galaxy, some of which may be related to GCs today.
