The Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS), operating in Paranal since 2016, is a wide-field survey
to detect Neptunes and super-Earths transiting bright stars, which are suitable for precise radial
velocity follow-up and characterisation. Thereby, its sub-mmag photometric precision and ability
to identify false positives are crucial. Particularly, variable background objects blended in
the photometric aperture frequently mimic Neptune-sized transits and are costly in follow-up
time. These objects can best be identified with the centroiding technique: if the photometric flux
is lost off-centre during an eclipse, the flux centroid shifts towards the centre of the target star.
Although this method has successfully been employed by the Kepler mission, it has previously not
been implemented from the ground. We present a fully-automated centroid vetting algorithm developed
for NGTS, enabled by our high-precision auto-guiding. Our method allows detecting centroid shifts
with an average precision of 0.75 milli-pixel, and down to 0.25 milli-pixel for specific targets,
for a pixel size of 4.97 arcsec. The algorithm is now part of the NGTS candidate vetting pipeline and
automatically employed for all detected signals. Further, we develop a joint Bayesian fitting
model for all photometric and centroid data, allowing to disentangle which object (target or background)
is causing the signal, and what its astrophysical parameters are. We demonstrate our method on two
NGTS objects of interest. These achievements make NGTS the first ground-based wide-field transit
survey ever to successfully apply the centroiding technique for automated candidate vetting,
enabling the production of a robust candidate list before follow-up.
