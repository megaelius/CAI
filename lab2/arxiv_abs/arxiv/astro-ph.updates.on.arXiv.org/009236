We describe a novel Godunov-type numerical method for solving the equations of resistive relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics. In the proposed approach, the spatial components of both magnetic and electric
fields are located at zone interfaces and are evolved using the constrained transport formalism.
Direct application of Stokes' theorem to Faraday's and Ampere's laws ensures that the resulting
discretization is divergence-free for the magnetic field and charge-conserving for the electric
field. Hydrodynamic variables retain, instead, the usual zone-centred representation commonly
adopted in finite-volume schemes. Temporal discretization is based on Runge-Kutta implicit-explicit
(IMEX) schemes in order to resolve the temporal scale disparity introduced by the stiff source term
in Ampere's law. The implicit step is accomplished by means of an improved and more efficient Newton-Broyden
multidimensional root-finding algorithm. The explicit step relies on a multidimensional Riemann
solver to compute the line-averaged electric and magnetic fields at zone edges and it employs a one-dimensional
Riemann solver at zone interfaces to update zone-centred hydrodynamic quantities. For the latter,
we introduce a five-wave solver based on the frozen limit of the relaxation system whereby the solution
to the Riemann problem can be decomposed into an outer Maxwell solver and an inner hydrodynamic solver.
A number of numerical benchmarks demonstrate that our method is superior in stability and robustness
to the more popular charge-conserving divergence cleaning approach where both primary electric
and magnetic fields are zone-centered. In addition, the employment of a less diffusive Riemann
solver noticeably improves the accuracy of the computations.
