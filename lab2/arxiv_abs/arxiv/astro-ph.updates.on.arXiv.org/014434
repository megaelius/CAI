An excess of flux in the early light curves of type Ia supernovae has been observed in a few cases. Multiple
scenarios have been proposed to explain this. Recently, it has been shown that for at least one object
(SN$~$2018oh) the excess emission observed could be the result of a large-scale clump of $^{56}$Ni
in the outer ejecta of $\sim$0.03$~M_{\rm{\odot}}$. We present model light curves and spectra
for ejecta profiles containing $^{56}$Ni clumps of varying masses (0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04$~M_{\rm{\odot}}$)
and shapes. We find that even for our lowest mass $^{56}$Ni clump, an increase of $\gtrsim$2 magnitudes
is produced in the bolometric light curve at one day after explosion, relative to models without
a $^{56}$Ni clump. We show that the colour evolution of models with a $^{56}$Ni clump differs significantly
from those without, and shows a colour inversion similar to some double-detonation explosion models.
Furthermore, spectra of our $^{56}$Ni clump models show that strong suppression of flux between
$\sim$3$~$700 $-$ 4$~$000$~$Ang. close to maximum light appears to be a generic feature for this
class of model. Comparing our models to observations of SNe$~$2017cbv and 2018oh, we show that a
$^{56}$Ni clump of 0.02 $-$ 0.04$~M_{\rm{\odot}}$ can match shapes of the early light curve bumps,
however the colour and spectral evolution are in disagreement. This would indicate that an alternative
origin for the flux excess is necessary. In addition, based on existing explosion scenarios, producing
a large-scale, macroscopic $^{56}$Ni clump in the outer ejecta as required to match the light curve
shape, without the presence of additional short-lived radioactive material, may prove challenging.
Given that only a small amount of $^{56}$Ni in the outer ejecta is required to produce a bump in the
light curve, such a large clump in the outer ejecta must be rare, if it were to occur at all.
