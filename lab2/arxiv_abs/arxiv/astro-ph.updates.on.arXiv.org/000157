This paper reports a comprehensive study on the gravitational wave (GW) background from compact
binary coalescences. We consider in our calculations newly available observation-based neutron
star and black hole mass distributions and complete analytical waveforms that include post-Newtonian
amplitude corrections. Our results show that: (i) post-Newtonian effects cause a small reduction
in the GW background signal; (ii) below 100 Hz the background depends primarily on the local coalescence
rate $r_0$ and the average chirp mass and is independent of the chirp mass distribution; (iii) the
effects of cosmic star formation rates and delay times between the formation and merger of binaries
are linear below 100 Hz and can be represented by a single parameter within a factor of ~ 2; (iv) a simple
power law model of the energy density parameter $\Omega_{GW}(f) ~ f^{2/3}$ up to 50-100 Hz is sufficient
to be used as a search template for ground-based interferometers. In terms of the detection prospects
of the background signal, we show that: (i) detection (a signal-to-noise ratio of 3) within one year
of observation by the Advanced LIGO detectors (H1-L1) requires a coalescence rate of $r_0 = 3 (0.2)
Mpc^{-3} Myr^{-1}$ for binary neutron stars (binary black holes); (ii) this limit on $r_0$ could
be reduced 3-fold for two co-located detectors, whereas the currently proposed worldwide network
of advanced instruments gives only ~ 30% improvement in detectability; (iii) the improved sensitivity
of the planned Einstein Telescope allows not only confident detection of the background but also
the high frequency components of the spectrum to be measured. Finally we show that sub-threshold
binary neutron star merger events produce a strong foreground, which could be an issue for future
terrestrial stochastic searches of primordial GWs.
