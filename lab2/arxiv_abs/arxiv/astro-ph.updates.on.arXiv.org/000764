The outflow force of molecular bipolar outflows is a key parameter in theories of young stellar feedback
on their surroundings. The focus of many outflow studies is the correlation between the outflow
force, bolometric luminosity and envelope mass. However, it is difficult to combine the results
of different studies in large evolutionary plots over many orders of magnitude due to the range of
data quality, analysis methods and corrections for observational effects such as opacity and inclination.
We aim to determine the outflow force for a sample of low luminosity embedded sources. We will quantify
the influence of the analysis method and the assumptions entering the calculation of the outflow
force. We use the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope to map 12CO J=3-2 over 2'x2' regions around 16 Class
I sources of a well-defined sample in Ophiuchus at 15" resolution. The outflow force is then calculated
using seven different methods differing e.g. in the use of intensity-weighted emission and correction
factors for inclination. The results from the analysis methods differ from each other by up to a factor
of 6, whereas observational properties and choices in the analysis procedure affect the outflow
force by up to a factor of 4. For the sample of Class I objects, bipolar outflows are detected around
13 sources including 5 new detections, where the three non-detections are confused by nearby outflows
from other sources. When combining outflow forces from different studies, a scatter by up to a factor
of 5 can be expected. Although the true outflow force remains unknown, the separation method (separate
calculation of dynamical time and momentum) is least affected by the uncertain observational parameters.
The correlations between outflow force, bolometric luminosity and envelope mass are further confirmed
down to low luminosity sources.
