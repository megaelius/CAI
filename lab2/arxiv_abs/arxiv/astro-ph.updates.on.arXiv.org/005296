We report the white light flare rates for 10 ultracool dwarfs (UCDs) using \textit{Kepler K2} short
cadence data. Among our sample stars, two have spectral type M6, three are M7, three are M8 and two
are L0. Most of our targets are old low mass stars. We identify a total of 283 flares in all of the stars
in our sample, with \textit{Kepler} energies in the range log \textit{E$_{Kp}$} $\sim$(29 - 33.5)
erg. Using the maximum-likelihood method of line fitting, we find that the flare frequency distribution
(FFD) for each star in our sample follows a power law with slope -$\alpha$ in range -(1.3-2.0). We
find that cooler objects tend to have shallower slopes. For some of our targets, the FFD follows either
a broken power law, or a power law with an exponential cutoff. For the L0 dwarf 2MASS J12321827-0951502,
we find a very shallow slope (-$\alpha$ $=$ -1.3) in the \textit{Kepler} energy range (0.82-130)$\times$10$^{30}$
erg: this L0 dwarf has flare rates which are comparable to the rates of high energy flares in stars
of earlier spectral types. In addition, we report photometry of two superflares: one on the L0 dwarf
2MASS J12321827-0951502 and another on the M7 dwarf 2MASS J08352366+1029318. In case of 2MASS J12321827-0951502,
we report a flare brightening by a factor of $\sim$144 relative to the quiescent photospheric level.
Likewise, for 2MASS J08352366+1029318, we report a flare brightening by a factor of $\sim$60 relative
to the quiescent photospheric level. These two superflares have bolometric (UV/optical/infrared)
energies 3.6 $\times$ 10$^{33}$ erg and 8.9 $\times$ 10$^{33}$ erg respectively, while the FWHM
time scales are very short, $\sim$2 minutes. We find that the M8 star TRAPPIST-1 is more active than
the M8.5 dwarf: 2M03264453+1919309, but less active than another M8 dwarf (2M12215066-0843197).
