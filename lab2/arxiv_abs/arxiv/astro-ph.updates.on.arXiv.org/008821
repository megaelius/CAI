We fit an isothermal oscillatory density model of Neptune's protoplanetary disk to the surviving
regular satellites and its innermost ring and we determine the radial scale length of the disk, the
equation of state and the central density of the primordial gas, and the rotational state of the Neptunian
nebula. Neptune's regular moons suffered from the retrograde capture of Triton that disrupted
the system. Some moons may have been ejected, while others may have survived inside their potential
minima. For this reason, the Neptunian nebula does not look like any of the nebulae that we modeled
previously. In particular, there must be two density maxima deep inside the core of the nebula where
no moons or rings are found nowadays. Even with this strong assumption, the recent discovery of the
minor moon N XIV complicates further the modeling effort. With some additional assumptions, the
Neptunian nebula still shares many similarities with the Uranian nebula, as was expected from the
relative proximity and similar physical conditions of the two systems. For Neptune's primordial
disk, we find a steep power-law index ($k=-3.0$), needed to accommodate the arrangement of the outer
moons Larissa, N XIV, and Proteus. The rotation parameter that measures centrifugal support against
self-gravity is quite small ($\beta_0=0.00808$), as is its radial scale length (13.6 km). The extent
of the disk ($R_{\rm max}=0.12$ Gm) is a lot smaller than that of Uranus ($R_{\rm max}=0.60$ Gm) and
Triton appears to be responsible for the truncation of the disk. The central density of the compact
Neptunian core and its angular velocity are higher than but comparable to those of Uranus' core.
In the end, we compare the models of the protoplanetary disks of the four gaseous giants.
