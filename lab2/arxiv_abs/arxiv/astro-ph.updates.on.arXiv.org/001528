Using deep narrow-band $H_2S1$ and $K_{s}$-band imaging data obtained with CFHT/WIRCam, we identify
a sample of 56 H$\alpha$ emission-line galaxies (ELGs) at $z=2.24$ with the 5$\sigma$ depths of
$H_2S1=22.8$ and $K_{s}=24.8$ (AB) over 383 arcmin$^{2}$ area in the ECDFS. A detailed analysis
is carried out with existing multi-wavelength data in this field. Three of the 56 H$\alpha$ ELGs
are detected in Chandra 4 Ms X-ray observation and two of them are classified as AGNs. The rest-frame
UV and optical morphologies revealed by HST/ACS and WFC3 deep images show that nearly half of the
H$\alpha$ ELGs are either merging systems or with a close companion, indicating that the merging/interacting
processes play a key role in regulating star formation at cosmic epoch z=2-3; About 14% are too faint
to be resolved in the rest-frame UV morphology due to high dust extinction. We estimate dust extinction
form SEDs. We find that dust extinction is generally correlated with H$\alpha$ luminosity and stellar
mass (SM). Our results suggest that H$\alpha$ ELGs are representative of star-forming galaxies
(SFGs). Applying extinction correction for individual objects, we examine the intrinsic H$\alpha$
luminosity function (LF) at $z=2.24$, obtaining a best-fit Schechter function characterized
by a faint-end slope of $\alpha=-1.3$. This is shallower than the typical slope of $\alpha \sim -1.6$
in previous works based on constant extinction correction. We demonstrate that this difference
is mainly due to the different extinction corrections. The proper extinction correction is thus
key to recovering the intrinsic LF as the extinction globally increases with H$\alpha$ luminosity.
Moreover, we find that our H$\alpha$ LF mirrors the SM function of SFGs at the same cosmic epoch. This
finding indeed reflects the tight correlation between SFR and SM for the SFGs, i.e., the so-called
main sequence.
