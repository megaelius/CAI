We present H-band polarized scattered light imagery and JHK high-contrast spectroscopy of the
protoplanetary disk around HD 163296 observed with the HiCIAO and SCExAO/CHARIS instruments at
Subaru Observatory. The polarimetric imagery resolve a broken ring structure surrounding HD 163296
that peaks at a distance along the major axis of 0.65 (66 AU) and extends out to 0.98 (100 AU) along the
major axis. Our 2011 H-band data exhibit clear axisymmetry, with the NW- and SE- side of the disk exhibiting
similar intensities. Our data are clearly different than 2016 epoch H-band observations from VLT/SPHERE
that found a strong 2.7x asymmetry between the NW- and SE-side of the disk. Collectively, these results
indicate the presence of time variable, non-azimuthally symmetric illumination of the outer disk.
Based on our 3D-MCRT modeling of contemporaneous IR spectroscopic and H-band polarized intensity
imagery of the system, we suggest that while the system could plausibly host an inclined inner disk
component, such a component is unlikely to be responsible for producing the observed time-dependent
azimuthal variations in the outer scattered light disk of the system. While our SCExAO/CHARIS data
are sensitive enough to recover the planet candidate identified from NIRC2 in the thermal IR, we
fail to detect an object with a corresponding JHK brightness estimated from the atmospheric models
of Baraffe et al. 2003. This suggests that the candidate is either fainter in JHK bands than model
predictions, possibly due to extinction from the disk or atmospheric dust/clouds, or that it is
an artifact of the dataset/data processing. Our SCExAO/CHARIS data lower the IR mass limits for
planets inferred at larger stellocentric separations; however, these ALMA-predicted protoplanet
candidates are currently still consistent with direct imaging constraints.
