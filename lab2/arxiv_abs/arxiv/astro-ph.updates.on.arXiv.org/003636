The compositions of stars and planets are connected, yet, the definition of "habitability" and
the "habitable zone" only take into account the physical relationship between the star and planet.
Planets, however, are made truly habitable by both chemical and physical processes which regulate
climatic and geochemical cycling between atmosphere, surface, and interior reservoirs. Despite
this, "Earth-like" is often defined as a planet made of a mixture of rock and Fe that is roughly 1 Earth-density.
To understand the interior of a terrestrial planet, the stellar abundances of planet-building
elements (e.g. Mg, Si, and Fe) can be utilized as a proxy for the planet's composition. We explore
the planetary mineralogy and structure for fictive planets around the 10 closest stars to the Sun
using stellar abundances from the Hypatia Catalog. Despite our sample containing stars both sub-
and super-solar in their abundances, we find that the mineralogies are very similar for all 10 planets
-- since the error or spread in the stellar abundances create significant degeneracy in the models.
We show that abundance uncertainties need to be on the order of [Fe/H] < 0.02 dex, [Si/H] < 0.01 dex,
[Al/H] < 0.002 dex, while [Mg/H] and [Ca/H] < 0.001 dex, in order to distinguish two unique planetary
populations in our sample of 10 stars. While these precisions are high, we believe they are possible
given certain abundance techniques, in addition to methodological transparency, recently demonstrated
in the literature. However, without these precisions, the uncertainty in planetary structures
will be so high that we will be unable to say confidently that a planet is like the Earth, or unlike anything
we've ever seen.
