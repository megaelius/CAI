We investigate the evolution of intermediate-mass (IMBHs), stellar (BHs) and binary black holes
(BHBs), deposited near a supermassive black hole (SMBH) by a population of massive star clusters.
Stellar BHs rapidly segregate around the SMBH, driving the formation of extreme mass-ratio inspirals
that coalesce at a rate $\Gamma= 0.02-0.2$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ at redshift $z=0$. A few IMBHs orbiting
the SMBH favour the formation of massive pairs that coalescence within a Hubble time, being the merger
rate for this channel $\Gamma =0.03$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$. Recoiling kicks post-merger can eject
the remnant from the galaxy centre, especially in dwarf galaxies. Our results suggest that this
mechanism can lead to up to $10^5$ ejected SMBH within 1 Gpc. An IMBH co-existing with a few single
and binary BHs in the same cluster can affect significantly their evolution, either driving binary
disruption, yielding to intermediate-mass ratio inspirals (merger rate $\Gamma =9.5$ yr$^{-1}$
Gpc$^{-3}$), or boosting BHBs coalescence ($\Gamma =2-8$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$). In a few simulations,
the SMBH boosts BHBs coalescence, leading this process to a merger rate $\Gamma =1$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$.
We note that BHBs experiencing a merger in a galactic nucleus can be erroneously estimated $\sim
30\%$ heavier than it really is because of the Doppler shift of the wave frequency as caused by the
rapid motion around the SMBH. All our simulations are carried out using an $N$-body code tailored
to treat close encounters and post-Newtonian dynamics, that includes also the galaxy field and
dynamical friction in the particles' equation of motion.
