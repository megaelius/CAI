In this article, we present the effect of a strong magnetic field in the burning of a neutron star (NS).
We have used relativistic magneto-hydrostatic (MHS) conservation equations for studying the
PT from nuclear matter (NM) to quark matter (QM). We found that the shock-induced phase transition
(PT) is likely if the density of the star core is more than three times nuclear saturation ($\rho_s$)
density. We have also obtained that the conversion process from NS to quark star (QS) is an exothermic
process beyond such densities. The burning process at the star center most likely starts as a deflagration
process. However, there can be a small density window at lower densities where the process can be
a detonation one. However, at such low densities, the NM energy and QM energy are almost equal, and
it is unlikely that the PT process would be an exothermic one. At small enough infalling matter velocities
the resultant magnetic field of the QS is lower than that of the NS. However, for a higher value of infalling
matter velocities, the magnetic field of QM becomes larger. Therefore, depending on the initial
density fluctuation and on whether the PT is a violent one or not the QS could be more magnetic or less
magnetic. This can have substantial observational significance because a strong magnetar can
suddenly become less magnetic and would not show common magnetar properties vice-versa. The PT
also have a considerable effect on the magnetic tilt of the star. For smaller velocities and densities
the magnetic angle are not affected much but for higher infalling velocities tilt of the magnetic
change suddenly. Such angular change can have a massive effect on the observation of the magnetars
where new observation can be recorded after PT.
