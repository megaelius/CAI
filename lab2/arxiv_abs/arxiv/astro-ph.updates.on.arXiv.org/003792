Context. A number of novae have been found to emit high-energy gamma rays (>100 MeV). However, the
origin of this emission is not yet understood. We report on the search for gamma-ray emission from
75 optically-detected Galactic novae in the first 7.4 years of operation of the Fermi Large Area
Telescope using the Pass 8 data set. Aims. We compile an optical nova catalog including light curves
from various resources and estimate the optical peak time and optical peak magnitude in order to
search for gamma-ray emission to test if all novae are gamma-ray emitters. Methods. We repeat the
analysis of the six novae previously identified as gamma-ray sources and develop a unified analysis
strategy which we then apply to all novae in our catalog. We search for emission in a 15-day time window
in two-day steps ranging from 20 days before to 20 days after the optical peak time. We perform a population
study with Monte Carlo simulations to set constraints on the properties of the gamma-ray emission
of novae. Results. Two new novae candidates have been found at 2sigma global significance. Although
these two novae candidates were not detected at a significant level individually, taking them together
with the other non-detected novae, we found a sub-threshold nova population with a cumulative 3sigma
significance. We report the measured gamma-ray flux for detected sources and flux upper limits
for novae without significant detection. Our results can be reproduced by several gamma-ray emissivity
models (e.g. a power-law distribution with a slope of 2), while a constant emissivity model (i.e.
assuming novae are standard candles) can be rejected.
