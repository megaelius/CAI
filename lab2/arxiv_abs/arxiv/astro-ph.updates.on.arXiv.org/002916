The next generation of Extremely Large Telescopes (ELT), with diameters up to 39 meters, is planned
to begin operation in the next decade and promises new challenges in the development of instruments
since the instrument size increases in proportion to the telescope diameter D, and the cost as D2
or faster. The growing field of astrophotonics (the use of photonic technologies in astronomy)
could solve this problem by allowing mass production of fully integrated and robust instruments
combining various optical functions, with the potential to reduce the size, complexity and cost
of instruments. Astrophotonics allows for a broad range of new optical functions, with applications
ranging from sky background filtering, high spatial and spectral resolution imaging and spectroscopy.
In this paper, we want to provide astronomers with valuable keys to understand how photonics solutions
can be implemented (or not) according to the foreseen applications. The paper introduces first
key concepts linked to the characteristics of photonics technologies, placed in the framework
of astronomy and spectroscopy. We then describe a series of merit criteria that help us determine
the potential of a given micro-spectrograph technology for astronomy applications, and then take
an inventory of the recent developments in integrated micro-spectrographs with potential for
astronomy. We finally compare their performance, to finally draw a map of typical science requirements
and pin the identified integrated technologies on it. We finally emphasize the necessary developments
that must support micro-spectrograph in the coming years.
