We study the properties of the cold gas component of the interstellar medium of the Herschel Reference
Survey, a complete volume-limited (15<D<25 Mpc), K-band-selected sample of galaxies spanning
a wide range in morphological type (from E to Im) and stellar mass (10^9<M*<10^11 Mo). The
multifrequency data in our hands are used to trace the molecular gas mass distribution and the main
scaling relations of the sample, which put strong constraints on galaxy formation simulations.
We extend the main scaling relations concerning the total and the molecular gas component determined
for massive galaxies (M* > 10^10 Mo) from the COLD GASS survey down to stellar masses M* ~ 10^9 Mo.
As scaling variables we use M*, the stellar surface density mu*, the specific star formation rate
SSFR, and the metallicity of the target galaxies. By comparing molecular gas masses determined
using a constant or a luminosity dependent conversion factor, we estimate the robustness of these
scaling relations on the very uncertain assumptions used to transform CO line intensities into
molecular gas masses. The molecular gas distribution of a K-band-selected sample is different
from that of a far-infrared-selected sample since it includes a significantly smaller number of
objects with M(H2) < 6 10^9 Mo. In spiral galaxies the molecular gas phase is only 25-30% of the
atomic gas. The analysis also indicates that the slope of the main scaling relations depends on the
adopted conversion factor. Among the sampled relations, all those concerning M(gas)/M* are statistically
significant and show little variation with X_CO. We observe a significant correlation between
M(H2)/M* and SSFR, M(H2)/M(HI) and mu*, M(H2)/M(HI), and 12+log(O/H) regardless of the adopted
X_CO. The total and molecular gas consumption timescales are anticorrelated with the SSFR.
