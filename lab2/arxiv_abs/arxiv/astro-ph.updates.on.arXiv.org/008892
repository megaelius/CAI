The discovery of luminous quasars at redshifts up to 7.5 demonstrates the existence of several billion
M_sun supermassive black holes (SMBHs) less than a billion years after the Big Bang. They are accompanied
by intense star formation in their host galaxies, pinpointing sites of massive galaxy assembly
in the early universe, while their absorption spectra reveal an increasing neutral intergalactic
medium (IGM) at the epoch of reionization. Extrapolating from the rapid evolution of the quasar
density at z=5-7, we expect that there is only one luminous quasar powered by a billion M_sun SMBH
in the entire observable universe at z~9. In the next decade, new wide-field, deep near-infrared
(NIR) sky surveys will push the redshift frontier to the first luminous quasars at z~9-10; the combination
with new deep X-ray surveys will probe fainter quasar populations that trace earlier phases of SMBH
growth. The identification of these record-breaking quasars, and the measurements of their BH
masses and accretion properties require sensitive spectroscopic observations with next generation
of ground-based and space telescopes at NIR wavelengths. High-resolution integral-field spectroscopy
at NIR, and observations at millimeter and radio wavelengths, will together provide a panchromatic
view of the quasar host galaxies and their galactic environment at cosmic dawn, connecting SMBH
growth with the rise of the earliest massive galaxies. Systematic surveys and multiwavelength
follow-up observations of the earliest luminous quasars will strongly constrain the seeding and
growth of the first SMBHs in the universe, and provide the best lines of sight to study the history
of reionization.
