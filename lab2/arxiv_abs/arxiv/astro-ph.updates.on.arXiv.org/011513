In this paper, we present the application of a new method measuring Hubble parameter $H(z)$ by using
the anisotropy of luminosity distance($d_{L}$) of the gravitational wave(GW) standard sirens
of neutron star(NS) binary system. The method has never been put into practice so far due to the lack
of the ability of detecting GW. However, LIGO's success in detecting GW of black hole(BH) binary
system merger announced the potential possibility of this new method. We apply this method to several
GW detecting projects, including Advanced LIGO(aLIGO), Einstein Telescope(ET) and DECIGO, and
evaluate its constraint ability on cosmological parameters of $H(z)$. It turns out that the $H(z)$
by aLIGO and ET is of bad accuracy, while the $H(z)$ by DECIGO shows a good one. We simulate $H(z)$ data
at every 0.1 redshift span using the error information of $H(z)$ by DECIGO, and put the mock data into
the forecasting of cosmological parameters. Compared with the previous data and method, we get
an obviously tighter constraint on cosmological parameters by mock data, and a concomitantly higher
value of Figure of Merit(FoM, the reciprocal of the area enclosed by the $2\sigma$ confidence region).
For a 3-year-observation by standard sirens of DECIGO, the FoM value is as high as 170.82. If a 10-year-observation
is launched, the FoM could reach 569.42. For comparison, the FoM of 38 actual observed $H(z)$ data(OHD)
is 9.3. We also investigate the undulant universe, which shows a comparable improvement on the constraint
of cosmological parameters. These improvement indicates that the new method has great potential
in further cosmological constraints.
