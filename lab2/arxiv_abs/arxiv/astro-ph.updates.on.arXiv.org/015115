We report on XMM-Newton and NuSTAR X-ray observations of the prototypical polar, AM Herculis, supported
by ground-based photometry and spectroscopy, all obtained in high accretion states. In 2005, AM
Herculis was in its regular mode of accretion, showing a self-eclipse of the main accreting pole.
X-ray emission during the self-eclipse was assigned to a second pole through its soft X-ray emission
and not to scattering. In 2015, AM Herculis was in its reversed mode with strong soft blobby accretion
at the far accretion region. The blobby acretion region was more luminous than the other, persistently
accreting, therefore called main region. Hard X-rays from the main region did not show a self-eclipse
indicating a pronounced migration of the accretion footpoint. Extended phases of soft X-ray extinction
through absorption in interbinary matter were observed for the first time in AM Herculis. The spectral
parameters of a large number of individual soft flares could be derived. Simultaneous NuSTAR observations
in the reversed mode of accretion revealed clear evidence for Compton reflection of radiation from
the main pole at the white dwarf surface. This picture is supported by the trace of the Fe resonance
line at 6.4 keV through the whole orbit. Highly ionized oxygen lines observed with the Reflection
Grating Spectrometer (RGS) were tentatively located at the bottom of the accretion column, although
the implied densities are quite different from expectations. In the regular mode of accretion,
the phase-dependent modulations in the ultraviolet (UV) are explained with projection effects
of an accretion-heated spot at the prime pole. In the reversed mode projection effects cannot be
recognized. The light curves reveal an extra source of UV radiation and extended UV absorbing dips.
