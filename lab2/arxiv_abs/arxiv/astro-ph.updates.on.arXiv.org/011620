We performed a long-term optical (B, V, R bands), infra-red (J and K bands) and radio band (15, 22,
37 GHz band) study on the flat spectrum radio quasar, 3C 454.3, using the data collected over a period
of more than 8 years (MJD 54500--57500). The temporal variability, spectral properties and inter-waveband
correlations were studied by dividing the available data into smaller segments with more regular
sampling. This helped us constrain the size and the relative locations of the emission regions for
different wavebands. Spectral analysis of the source revealed the interplay between the accretion
disk and jet emission. The source predominantly showed a redder-when-brighter trend, though we
observed a bluer-when-brighter trend at high flux levels which could be signatures of particle
acceleration and radiative cooling. Significant correlations with near-zero lag were seen between
various optical/infra-red bands, indicating that these emission regions are co-spatial. Correlations
with a time lag of about 10--100 days are seen between optical/infra-red and radio bands indicating
these emissions arise from different regions. We also observe the DCF peak lag change from year to
year. We try to explain these differences using a curved jet model where the different emission regions
have different viewing angles resulting in a frequency dependent Doppler factor. This variable
Doppler factor model explains the variability timescales and the variation in DCF peak lag between
the radio and optical emissions in different segments. Lags of 6-180 days are seen between emissions
in various radio bands, indicating a core-shift effect
