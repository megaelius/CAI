Astronomical images suffer a constant presence of multiple defects that are consequences of the
intrinsic properties of the acquisition equipments, and atmospheric conditions. One of the most
frequent defects in astronomical imaging is the presence of additive noise which makes a denoising
step mandatory before processing data. During the last decade, a particular modeling scheme, based
on sparse representations, has drawn the attention of an ever growing community of researchers.
Sparse representations offer a promising framework to many image and signal processing tasks,
especially denoising and restoration applications. At first, the harmonics, wavelets, and similar
bases and overcomplete representations have been considered as candidate domains to seek the sparsest
representation. A new generation of algorithms, based on data-driven dictionaries, evolved rapidly
and compete now with the off-the-shelf fixed dictionaries. While designing a dictionary beforehand
leans on a guess of the most appropriate representative elementary forms and functions, the dictionary
learning framework offers to construct the dictionary upon the data themselves, which provides
us with a more flexible setup to sparse modeling and allows to build more sophisticated dictionaries.
In this paper, we introduce the Centered Dictionary Learning (CDL) method and we study its performances
for astronomical image denoising. We show how CDL outperforms wavelet or classic dictionary learning
denoising techniques on astronomical images, and we give a comparison of the effect of these different
algorithms on the photometry of the denoised images.
