We combine high-resolution spectroscopic data from APOGEE-2 survey Data Release 16 (DR16) with
photometric data from several sources, as well as parallaxes from Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2). Using
the Bayesian isochrone-fitting code StarHorse, we derive distances, extinctions and astrophysical
parameters for around 388,000 APOGEE stars, achieving typical distance uncertainties of $\sim
11\%$ for APOGEE giants, $\sim 5\%$ for APOGEE dwarfs, as well as extinction uncertainties of $\sim
0.07$mag, when all the photometric information is available. StarHorse uncertainties vary with
the spectroscopic input, with the available photometry, and with the parallax uncertainties.
The value-added catalog generated here was compared to the asteroseismic CoROGEE catalogue (for
which distances and extinctions are also updated according to the new DR16 spectroscopic inputs)
showing good agreement, but suggesting smaller parallax shifts in the mid plane fields with respect
to those found in the Kepler field. To illustrate the impact of the new StarHorse results we show an
analysis of the chemical spatial dependency of Galactic plane stars. Thanks to Gaia DR2 and the now
larger coverage of APOGEE-2 (including APOGEE-south) we obtain an extended map of the Galactic
plane, now reaching the inner-most parts of the Galaxy and providing an unprecedented coverage
of the disk close to the Galactic mid-plane. The distance and extinction improvements unveil the
presence of the bar in a density diagram, as well as the striking chemical duality in the innermost
regions of the disk, now clearly extending to the bulge. For the first time we are able to have a much
less fragmented view of our Galaxy. We complement this paper with distances and extinctions for
stars in other public released spectroscopic surveys: 324,999 in GALAH DR2, 6,095 in GES DR4, 4,928,715
in LAMOST DR5, and 433,177 in RAVE DR5.
