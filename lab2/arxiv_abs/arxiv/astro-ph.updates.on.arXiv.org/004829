The Transient High-Energy Sky and Early Universe Surveyor (THESEUS) is a mission concept developed
in the last years by a large European consortium, with interest in prospective participation by
research groups in USA and other non-European countries. As detailed in Amati et al. 2017 (arXiv:1710.04638)
and Stratta et al. 2017 (arXiv:1712.08153), THESEUS aims at exploiting high-redshift Gamma-Ray
Bursts for getting unique clues on the early Universe and, being an unprecedentedly powerful machine
for the detection, accurate location and redshift determination of all types of GRBs (long, short,
high-z, under-luminous, ultra-long) and many other classes of transient sources and phenomena,
at providing a substantial contribution to multi-messenger astrophysics and time-domain astronomy.
Under these respects, THESEUS will show a beautiful synergy with the large observing facilities
of the future, like E-ELT, TMT, SKA, CTA, ATHENA, in the electromagnetic domain, as well as with next-generation
gravitational-waves and neutrino detectors, thus enhancing importantly their scientific return.
Moreover, it will also operate as a flexible IR and X-ray observatory, thus providing an even larger
involvement of the scientific community, as is currently the case for the Swift mission. In order
to further explore the magnificent prospective science of the mission, the THESEUS consortium
organized a Workshop in Naples on October 5-6 2017. The programme included about 50 reviews and talks
from worldwide recognized experts of the fields. The topics ranged from the description of the mission
concept, instrumentation and technologies to the main, additional and observatory science, further
showing the strong impact that THESEUS observations would have on several fields of astrophysics,
cosmology and fundamental physics.
