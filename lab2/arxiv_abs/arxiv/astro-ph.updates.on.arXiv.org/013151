The very first galaxies that started the cosmic dawn likely resided in so-called ''minihalos'',
with masses of $\sim10^5$--$10^8\mathrm{M}_\odot$, accreting their gas from the intergalactic
medium through H$_2$ cooling. Such molecularly-cooled galaxies (MCGs), mostly formed in pristine
environments, hosted massive, metal-free stars, and were eventually sterilized by the build-up
of a disassociating (Lyman-Werner; LW) background. Therefore, their properties might be very
different from the galaxies we see in the later Universe. Although MCGs are probably too faint to
be observed directly, we could nevertheless infer their properties from the imprint they leave
in the cosmic 21-cm signal. Here we quantify this imprint by extending the public simulation code
21cmFAST to allow for a distinct population of MCGs. We allow MCGs to have different properties from
other galaxies, including unique scaling relations for their stellar to halo mass ratios, ionizing
escape fractions, and spectral energy distributions. We track inhomogeneous recombinations,
disassociative LW feedback, and photo-heating from reionization. After demonstrating how MCGs
can shape the 21-cm signal, we explore to what extent current observations can already place constraints
on their properties. The CMB optical depth from Planck sets an upper limit on the product of the ionizing
escape fraction and the stellar mass in MCGs. When including also the timing of the putative EDGES
absorption signal, we find an additional strong degeneracy between the stellar mass and the X-ray
luminosity of MCGs. If proven to be of cosmic origin, the timing of the EDGES signal would have been
set by MCGs.
