Interferometric observations have demonstrated that a significant fraction of single-dish submillimetre
(submm) sources are blends of multiple submm galaxies (SMGs), but the nature of this multiplicity,
i.e. whether the galaxies are physically associated or chance projections, has not been determined.
We performed spectroscopy of 11 SMGs in six multi-component submm sources, obtaining spectroscopic
redshifts for nine of them. For an additional two component SMGs, we detected continuum emission
but no obvious features. We supplement our observed sources with four sources from the literature.
This sample allows us to statistically constrain the physical nature of single-dish submm source
multiplicity for the first time. In three [3/7, or 43 (-33/+39) per cent at 95% confidence] of the
single-dish sources for which the nature of the blending is unambiguous, the components for which
spectroscopic redshifts are available are physically associated, whereas 4/7 [57 (-39/+33) per
cent] have at least one unassociated component. When components whose spectra exhibit continuum
but no features and for which the photometric redshift is significantly different from the spectroscopic
redshift of the other component are also considered, 6/9 [67 (-37/+26) per cent] of the single-dish
sources are comprised of at least one unassociated component. The nature of the multiplicity of
one single-dish source is ambiguous. We conclude that physically associated systems and chance
projections both contribute to the multi-component single-dish submm source population. This
result contradicts the conventional wisdom that bright submm sources are solely a result of merger-induced
starbursts, as blending of unassociated galaxies is also important.
