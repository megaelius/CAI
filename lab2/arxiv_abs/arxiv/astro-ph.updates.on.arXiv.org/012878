We study the evolution in the number density of the highest mass galaxies over $0.4<z<1.5$ (covering
9 Gyr). We use the Spitzer/HETDEX Exploratory Large-Area (SHELA) Survey, which covers 17.5 $\mathrm{deg}^2$
with eight photometric bands spanning 0.3-4.5 $\mu$m within the SDSS Stripe 82 field. This size
produces the lowest counting uncertainties and cosmic variance yet for massive galaxies at $z\sim1.0$.
We study the stellar mass function (SMF) for galaxies with $\log(M_\ast/M_\odot)>10.3$ using
a forward-modeling method that fully accounts for statistical and systematic uncertainties on
stellar mass. From $z$=0.4 to 1.5 the massive end of the SMF shows minimal evolution in its shape:
the characteristic mass ($M^\ast$) evolves by less than 0.1 dex ($\pm$0.05 dex); the number density
of galaxies with $\log (M_\ast/M_\odot) >11$ stays roughly constant at $\log (n/\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3})$
$\simeq$ $-$3.4 ($\pm$0.05), then declines to $\log (n/\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3})$=$-$3.7 ($\pm$0.05)
at $z$=1.5. We discuss the uncertainties in the SMF, which are dominated by assumptions in the star
formation history and details of stellar population synthesis models for stellar mass estimations.
For quiescent galaxies, the data are consistent with no (or slight) evolution ($\lesssim0.1$ dex)
in the characteristic mass nor number density from $z\sim 1.5$ to the present. This implies that
any mass growth (presumably through "dry" mergers) of the quiescent massive galaxy population
must balance the rate of mass losses from late-stage stellar evolution and the formation of quenching
galaxies from the star-forming population. We provide a limit on this mass growth from $z=1.0$ to
0.4 of $\Delta M_\ast/M_\ast\leq$ 45% (i.e., $\simeq0.16$ dex) for quiescent galaxies more massive
than $10^{11}$ $M_\odot$.
