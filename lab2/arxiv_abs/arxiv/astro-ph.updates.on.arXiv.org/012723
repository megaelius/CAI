Understanding the evolution of self-gravitating, isothermal, magnetized gas is crucial for star
formation, as these physical processes have been postulated to set the initial mass function (IMF).
We present a suite of isothermal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations using the GIZMO code, that
resolve the formation of individual stars in giant molecular clouds (GMCs), spanning a range of
Mach numbers found in observed GMCs. As in past works, the mean and median stellar masses are sensitive
to numerical resolution, because they are sensitive to low-mass stars that contribute a vanishing
fraction of the overall stellar mass. The {\em mass-weighted} median stellar mass $M_\mathrm{50}$
becomes insensitive to resolution once turbulent fragmentation is well-resolved. Without imposing
Larson-like scaling laws, our simulations find $M_\mathrm{50} \propto M_\mathrm{0} \mathcal{M}^{-3}
\alpha_\mathrm{turb} \mathrm{SFE}^{1/3}$ for GMC mass $M_\mathrm{0}$, sonic Mach number $\mathcal{M}$,
virial parameter $\alpha_\mathrm{turb}$, and star formation efficiency $\mathrm{SFE}=M_\mathrm{\star}/M_\mathrm{0}$.
This fit agrees well with previous IMF results from the RAMSES, ORION2, and SphNG codes. Although
$M_\mathrm{50}$ has no significant dependence on the magnetic field strength at the cloud scale,
MHD is necessary to prevent a fragmentation cascade that results in non-convergent stellar masses.
For initial conditions and SFE similar to star-forming GMCs in our Galaxy, we predict $M_\mathrm{50}$
to be $>20 M_{\odot}$, an order of magnitude larger than observed ($\sim 2 M_\odot$), together with
an excess of brown dwarfs. Moreover, $M_\mathrm{50}$ is sensitive to initial cloud properties
and evolves strongly in time within a given cloud, predicting much larger IMF variations than are
observationally allowed. We conclude that physics beyond MHD turbulence and gravity are necessary
ingredients for the IMF.
