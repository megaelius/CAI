Stellar masses in future James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) deep blank-fields will be mainly derived
fitting the spectral energy distribution with theoretical galaxy templates. We investigate the
uncertainties and biases of the stellar masses derived by using the LePhare code for spectral energy
distribution fitting and the Yggdrasil theoretical templates. We consider a sample of mock galaxies
at z$=$7-10 with mock JWST observations with S/N$_{F150W}\geqslant$ 10. Our goal is to provide
a list of statistical stellar mass corrections to include on the stellar mass derivation for different
output galaxy properties and JWST filter combinations to correct for template degeneracies. Median
statistical stellar mass corrections vary from -0.83 dex to 0.87 dex, while 25$\%$ (75$\%$) quartiles
range from -0.83 dex (-0.67 dex) to 0.51 dex (0.88 dex), depending on filter combinations and galaxy
models. The most challenging cases are galaxies with nebular emission lines, especially the ones
that are wrongly identified as galaxies without, relative dust-free galaxies and galaxies with
small metallicities (i.e. Z$=1/50Z_{\odot}$). The stellar mass estimation of galaxies correctly
identified without emission lines is generally fine, except at z$=$10 when considering only the
8 NIRCam bands, which make the MIRI bands very valuable. We have tested our stellar mass corrections
using the public JAGUAR galaxy catalogue, deriving that the average discrepancy in the recovered
stellar mass distribution decreases by 20-50$\%$ at z$>$7 after the correction. We found that without
the stellar-mass corrections the number of low-mass galaxies (M$^{*}<10^{7}M_{\odot}$) is overestimated,
which can potentially lead to systematic errors in the calculation of the galaxy stellar mass function
faint-end slope at high z.
