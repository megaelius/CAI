Context. In a recent statistical study of sunspots in 79 active regions, the vertical magnetic field
component $B_\text{ver}$ averaged along the umbral boundary is found to be independent of sunspot
size. The authors of that study conclude that the absolute value of $B_\text{ver}$ at the umbral
boundary is the same for all spots. Aims. We investigate the temporal evolution of $B_\text{ver}$
averaged along the umbral boundary of one long-lived sunspot during its stable phase. Methods.
We analysed data from the HMI instrument on-board SDO. Contours of continuum intensity at $I_\text{c}=0.5I_\text{qs}$,
whereby $I_\text{qs}$ refers to the average over the quiet sun areas, are used to extract the magnetic
field along the umbral boundary. Projection effects due to different formation heights of the Fe
I 617.3 nm line and continuum are taken into account. To avoid limb artefacts, the spot is only analysed
for heliocentric angles smaller than $60^{\circ}$. Results. During the first disc passage, NOAA
AR 11591, $B_\text{ver}$ remains constant at 1693 G with a root-mean-square deviation of 15 G, whereas
the magnetic field strength varies substantially (mean 2171 G, rms of 48 G) and shows a long term variation.
Compensating for formation height has little influence on the mean value along each contour, but
reduces the variations along the contour when away from disc centre, yielding a better match between
the contours of $B_\text{ver}=1693$ G and $I_\text{c}=0.5I_\text{qs}$. Conclusions. During
the disc passage of a stable sunspot, its umbral boundary can equivalently be defined by using the
continuum intensity $I_\text{c}$ or the vertical magnetic field component $B_\text{ver}$. Contours
of fixed magnetic field strength fail to outline the umbral boundary.
