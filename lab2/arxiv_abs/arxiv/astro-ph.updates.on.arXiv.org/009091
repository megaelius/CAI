The best-characterized exoplanets to date are planets on close-in transiting orbits around their
host stars. The high level of irradiation and transiting geometry of these objects make them ideal
targets for atmospheric investigations. However, the modest apertures of many current telescopes
allow mostly low resolution spectra to be observed for transiting planets, failing to extract key
physical and chemical properties of their atmospheres. Ground-based 30-meter class telescopes
will set the stage for a substantial leap in our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres. We outline
a two-pronged survey, recently submitted as a Key Science Project (KSP) for the US ELTs, which would
yield unprecedented insight into the atmospheres of close-in exoplanets via combined observations
with the GMT and TMT. (1) The first opportunity involves measuring the global-scale atmospheric
circulation and planetary rotation for a sample of 40 hot Jupiters to glean insight into the unique
radiative forcing regime governing highly-irradiated, tidally-locked giant planets. (2) The
second opportunity involves measuring atmospheric mass-loss and extracting atmospheric composition
and abundance ratio information for $\sim60$ sub-Neptunes and super-Earths (including candidate
disintegrating planets) to constrain their formation and evolution histories. These efforts
would be made possible by the unparalleled combination of high spectral resolution instrumentation
and large aperture size of the ELTs. This survey would enable the first statistical study of atmospheric
circulation in extrasolar giant planets, and would provide detections of trace gases and measurements
of atmospheric escape in small-planet atmospheres, far exceeding the reach of \textit{JWST}.
