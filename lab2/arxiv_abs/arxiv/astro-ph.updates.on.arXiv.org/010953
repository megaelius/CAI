We explore the survival and lifetimes of cool clouds in multi-phase circum-galactic medium. We
revisit the "cloud crushing problem" in a large survey of numerical simulations including radiative
cooling and heating, ionization and self-shielding, self-gravity, magnetic fields, and anisotropic
Braginskii conduction and viscosity. We explore a wide range of parameters as well as a variety of
magnetic field strengths and geometries and initial cloud turbulence. For realistic magnetic
field and internal turbulence strengths in "full physics" 3D simulations, magnetic fields and
turbulence have relatively weak effects on cloud survival; the most important physics is radiative
cooling and conduction. Self-gravity and self-shielding are important for clouds which are initially
Jeans unstable, but largely irrelevant otherwise. Non-self-gravitating, realistically magnetized
clouds separate into four regimes: (1) At low column densities, clouds evaporate rapidly via conduction.
(2) A "failed pressure confinement" regime, where the ambient hot gas cools faster than the cloud-crossing
time and fails to provide pressure confinement for the cloud. (3) An "infinitely long-lived" regime,
in which the cloud lifetime becomes longer than the cooling time of gas swept up in the leading bow
shock, so the cloud begins to accrete and grow. (4) A "classical cloud destruction" regime, where
clouds are eventually destroyed by instabilities. In the final regime, the cloud lifetime can exceed
the naive cloud-crushing time, as initial conduction produces rapid evaporation off the surface
which compresses clouds into denser configurations than implied by simple two-phase pressure
equilibrium. However, it is also possible that small and/or slow-moving clouds evaporate more
rapidly than the cloud-crushing time. We develop simple analytic models that explain the simulated
cloud destruction times in this regime.
