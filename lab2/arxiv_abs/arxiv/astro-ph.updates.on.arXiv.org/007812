Context. Disks around pre-main-sequence stars evolve over time by turbulent viscous spreading.
The main contender to explain the strength of the turbulence is the Magneto-Rotational-Instability
(MRI) model, whose efficiency depends on the disk ionization fraction. Aims. We aim at computing
self-consistently the chemistry including PAH charge chemistry, the grain charging and an estimate
of an effective value of the turbulence alpha parameter in order to find observational signatures
of disk turbulence. Methods. We introduced PAH and grain charging physics and their interplay with
other gas-phase reactions in the physico-chemical code ProDiMo. Non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics
effects such as Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion are parametrized to derive an effective value for
the turbulent parameter alpha_eff . We explored the effects of turbulence heating and line broadening
on CO isotopologue sub-millimeter lines. Results. The spatial distribution of alpha_eff depends
on various unconstrained disk parameters such as the magnetic parameter beta_mag or the cosmic
ray density distribution inside the protoplanetary disks. The inner disk midplane shows the presence
of the so-called dead-zone where the turbulence is quasi-inexistent. The disk is heated mostly
by thermal accommodation on dust grains in the dead-zone, by viscous heating outside the dead-zone
up to a few hundred astronomical units, and by chemical heating in the outer disk. The CO rotational
lines probe the warm molecular disk layers where the turbulence is at its maximum. However, the effect
of turbulence on the CO line profiles is minimal and difficult to distinguish from the thermal broadening.
Conclusions. Viscous heating of the gas in the disk midplane outside the dead-zone is efficient.
The determination of alpha from CO rotational line observations alone is challenging.
