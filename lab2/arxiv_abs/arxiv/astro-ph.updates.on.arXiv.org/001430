Many chemically peculiar (CP) stars, especially the magnetic CP2 stars, show a flux depression
at 5200A. The "Delta a" photometric System takes advantage of this characteristic to detect these
objects in an efficient way. In addition, it is capable of finding metal-weak, emission-type, and
shell-type objects of the upper main sequence. To compare available observations and to detect
new peculiar objects, we used a spectrophotometric catalogue consisting of 1159 stars. From this
catalogue, we selected 1067 objects to synthesize three different "a" indices to find the most efficient
one for further observations. In addition, we extended the analysis to stars cooler than F5. We employed
classical "Delta a" photometry described by Maitzen, using simulated filter curves, the spectrophotometric
"Delta a" index by Adelman, and a modified index. During this investigation magnetic chemically
peculiar stars could be confirmed using the data of the catalogue and in addition we noticed an unknown
behavior for red stars in "Delta a", becoming independent of B-V. Even though the accuracy of the
spectrophotometry used for this investigation is significantly lower than the photometric "Delta
a" measurements, we are able to confirm peculiarity for most of the known CP2 stars above a certain
limit of "Delta a". We investigated 631 stars hotter than spectral type F5 to find additional that
are not yet identified peculiar objects. We find that for very low mass stars (M0), the "a" index is
independent of the colour (effective temperature). The "Delta a" photometric system is very closely
correlated with the effective temperature over a wide range of the main sequence. It is able to detect
any kind of peculiarity connected to the 5200A region. Especially for low-mass stars, this opens
up a new possibility of detecting peculiar objects in an efficient way.
