A recent occultation measurement of the dwarf planet Haumea (Ortiz et al. 2017) revealed an elongated
shape with the longest axis comparable to Pluto's mean diameter. The chords also indicate a ring
around Haumea's equatorial plane, where its largest moon, Hi'iaka, is also located. The Haumea
occultation size estimate (equivalent diameter 1595 km) is larger than previous radiometric solutions
(in the range between 1150 and 1350 km), which lowers the object's density to about 1.8 gcm-3, a value
closer to the densities of other large TNOs. We present unpublished and also reprocessed Herschel
and Spitzer MIR and FIR measurements. We compare 100 and 160um thermal lightcurve amplitudes - originating
from Haumea itself - with models of the total measured system fluxes (ring, satellite, Haumea) from
24-350um. The combination with results derived from the occultation measurements show that Haumea's
crystalline water ice surface must have a thermal inertia of ~5 SIu. We also have indications that
the satellites (at least Hi'iaka) must have high geometric albedos >=0.5, otherwise the derived
thermal amplitude would be inconsistent with the total measured system fluxes at 24, 70, 100, 160,
250, and 350um. The high albedos imply sizes of about 300 and 150 km for Hi'iaka and Namaka, respectively,
indicating unexpectedly high densities >1.0 gcm-3 for TNOs this small, and the assumed collisional
formation from Haumea's icy crust. We also estimated the thermal emission of the ring for the time
period 1980-2030, showing that the contribution during the Spitzer and Herschel epochs was small,
but not negligible. Due to the progressive opening of the ring plane, the ring emission will be increasing
in the next decade when JWST is operational. In the MIRI 25.5um band it will also be possible to obtain
a very high-quality thermal lightcurve to test the derived Haumea properties.
