This thesis presents the analysis of the clustering of galaxies in the 6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS).
At large separation scales the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal is detected which allows
to make an absolute distance measurement at $z_{\rm eff} = 0.106$. Such a measurement can be used
to constrain the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 67.0\pm3.2\;$km s$^{-1}\;$Mpc$^{-1}$ (4.8% precision).
Modelling the 2D galaxy correlation function of 6dFGS, $\xi(r_p,\pi)$, allows a measure of the
parameter combination $f(z_{\rm eff})\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff}) = 0.423 \pm 0.055$, where $f \simeq
\Omega_m^{\gamma}(z)$ is the growth rate of cosmic structure and $\sigma_8$ is the r.m.s. of matter
fluctuations in $8h^{-1}\,$Mpc spheres. Such a measurement allows to test the relationship between
matter and gravity on cosmic scales by constraining the growth index of density fluctuations, $\gamma$.
The 6dFGS measurement of $f\sigma_8$ combined with WMAP-7, results in $\gamma = 0.547 \pm 0.088$,
consistent with the prediction of General Relativity ($\gamma_{\rm GR} \approx 0.55$). The last
chapter of this thesis studies the stellar-mass dependence of galaxy clustering in the 6dF Galaxy
Survey. Using the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model, this analysis investigates the trend
of dark matter halo mass and satellite fraction with stellar mass by measuring the projected correlation
function, $w_p(r_p)$. The findings of this analysis are, that the typical halo mass ($M_1$) as well
as the satellite power law index ($\alpha$) increase with stellar mass. The 6dFGS results are compared
to two different semi-analytic models derived from the Millennium Simulation, as well as weak lensing
measurements.
