We present the North Galactic Cap sample of the Extremely Luminous Quasar Survey (ELQS-N), which
targets quasars with $M_{1450}<-27$ at $2.8 \leq z < 5$ in an area of $\sim7600\,\rm{deg}^2$ of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) footprint with $90\text{\textdegree}<\rm{RA}<270\text{\textdegree}$.
Based on a near-infrared/infrared \textit{JKW2} color cut, the ELQS selection efficiently uses
random forest methods to classify quasars and to estimate photometric redshifts; this scheme overcomes
some of the difficulties of pure optical quasar selection at $z\approx3$. As a result, we retain
a completeness of $>70\%$ over $z\sim3.0-5.0$ at $m_{i}\lesssim17.5$, limited toward fainter
magnitudes by the depth of the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). The presented quasar catalog consists
of a total of 270 objects, of which 39 are newly identified in this work with spectroscopy obtained
at the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope and the MMT $6.5\,\rm{m}$ telescope. In addition
to the high completeness, which allowed us to discover new quasars in the already well-surveyed
SDSS North Galactic Cap, the efficiency of our selection is relatively high at $\sim79\%$. Using
120 objects of this quasar sample we are able to extend the previously measured optical quasar luminosity
function (QLF) by one magnitude toward the bright end at $2.8 \leq z \leq 4.5$. A first analysis of
the QLF suggests a relatively steep bright-end slope of $\beta\approx-4$ for this sample. This
result contrasts with previous results in the same redshift range, which find a much flatter slope
around $\beta\sim-2.5$, but agrees with recent measurements of the bright-end slope at lower and
higher redshifts. Our results constrain the bright-end slope at $z=2.8-4.5$ to $\beta<-2.94$
with a 99\% confidence.
