Velocity offsets in the broad Balmer lines of quasars and their temporal variations serve as indirect
evidence for bound supermassive black hole binaries (SBHBs) at sub-parsec separations. In this
work, we test the SBHB hypothesis for 14 quasars with double-peaked broad emission lines using their
long-term (14--41 years) radial velocity curves. We improve on previous work by (a) using elliptical
instead of circular orbits for the SBHBs, (b) adopting a statistical model for radial velocity jitter,
(c) employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to explore the orbital parameter space efficiently
and build posterior distributions of physical parameters and (d) incorporating new observations.
We determine empirically that jitter comprises approximately Gaussian distributed fluctuations
about the smooth radial velocity curves that are larger than the measurement errors by factors of
order a few. We initially treat jitter by enlarging the effective error bars and then verify this
approach via a variety of Gaussian process models for it. We find lower mass limits for the hypothesized
SBHBs in the range $10^8$--$10^{11}\;M_{\odot}$. For seven objects the SBHB scenario appears
unlikely based on goodness-of-fit tests. For two additional objects the minimum SBHB masses are
unreasonably large ($>10^{10}\;M_{\odot}$), strongly disfavoring the SBHB scenario. Using
constraints on the orbital inclination angle (which requires some assumptions) makes the minimum
masses of four more objects unreasonably large. We also cite physical and observational arguments
against the SBHB hypothesis for nine objects. We conclude that the SBHB explanation is not the favoured
explanation of double-peaked broad emission lines.
