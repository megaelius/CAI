Far-infrared (FIR) dust polarimetry enables the study of interstellar magnetic fields via tracing
of the polarized emission from dust grains that are partially aligned with the direction of the field.
The advent of high quality polarimetric data has permitted the use of statistical methods to extract
both the direction and magnitude of the magnetic field. This work presents an effort to produce maps
(integrated along the line of sight) of the magnetic field strength in both the line-of-sight (LOS)
direction and in the plane-of-sky (POS) in the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC-1) using all four HAWC+
polarimetry bands (53, 89, 154 and 214 $\micron$). Using the statistics of the polarization data
(angles and fractions) along with previously-reported Zeeman measurements, information about
the three-dimensional magnetic field configuration was inferred over the OMC-1 region. POS magnetic
field strengths of up to 2 mG were determined in OMC-1. The strongest fields were observed near the
BN/KL object, while the OMC-1 bar shows strengths of up to few hundreds of $\mu$G. The LOS magnetic
field has been determined to have comparable strengths to the POS components but it is differently
distributed across the cloud. These estimates of the magnetic field components were used to produce
more reliable maps of the mass-to-magnetic flux ratio ($M/\Phi$) -- a proxy for probing the conditions
for star formation in molecular clouds -- and determine regions of sub- and super-criticality in
OMC-1. Such maps can provide invaluable input and comparison to MHD simulations of star formation
processes in filamentary structures of molecular clouds.
