We conduct two kinds of homogeneous isotropic turbulence simulations relevant for the intracluster
medium (ICM): (i) pure turbulence runs without radiative cooling; (ii) turbulent heating$+$radiative
cooling runs with global thermal balance. For pure turbulence runs in the subsonic regime, the rms
density and surface brightness (SB) fluctuations vary as the square of the rms Mach number ($\mathcal{M}_{\text{rms}}$).
However, with thermal balance, the density and SB fluctuations $(\delta SB/SB)$ are much larger.
These scalings have implications for translating SB fluctuations into a turbulent velocity, particularly
for cool cores. For thermal balance runs with large (cluster core) scale driving, both the hot and
cold phases of the gas are supersonic. For small scale (one order of magnitude smaller than the cluster
core) driving, multiphase gas forms on a much longer timescale but $\mathcal{M}_{\text{rms}}$
is smaller. Both small and large scale driving runs have velocities larger than the Hitomi results
from the Perseus cluster. Thus turbulent heating as the dominant heating source in cool cluster
cores is ruled out if multiphase gas is assumed to condense out from the ICM. Next we perform thermal
balance runs in which we partition the input energy into thermal and turbulent parts and tune their
relative magnitudes. The contribution of turbulent heating has to be $\lesssim 10\%$ in order for
turbulence velocities to match Hitomi observations. If the dominant source of multiphase gas is
not cooling from the ICM (but say uplift from the central galaxy), the importance of turbulent heating
cannot be excluded.
