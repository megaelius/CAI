Using \Planck\ data combined with the Meta Catalogue of X-ray detected Clusters of galaxies (MCXC),
we address the study of peculiar motions by searching for evidence of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich
effect (kSZ). By implementing various filters designed to extract the kSZ generated at the positions
of the clusters, we obtain consistent constraints on the radial peculiar velocity average, root
mean square (rms), and local bulk flow amplitude at different depths. For the whole cluster sample
of average redshift 0.18, the measured average radial peculiar velocity with respect to the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) radiation at that redshift, i.e., the kSZ monopole, amounts to $72 \pm
60$\,km\,s$^{-1}$. This constitutes less than 1\,% of the relative Hubble velocity of the cluster
sample with respect to our local CMB frame. From a subset of this cluster sample \Planck\ finds the
radial peculiar velocity rms to be below 800\,km\,s$^{-1}$ at the 95\,% confidence level, which
is around three times the $\Lambda$CDM prediction for the typical cluster radial velocity rms at
$z=0.15$. \Planck\ data also set strong constraints on the local bulk flow in volumes centred on
the Local Group. There is no detection of bulk flow as measured in any comoving sphere extending to
the maximum redshift covered by the cluster sample. A blind search for bulk flows in this sample has
an upper limit of 254\,km\,s$^{-1}$ (95\,% confidence level) dominated by CMB confusion and instrumental
noise, indicating that the Universe is largely homogeneous on Gpc scales. In this context, in conjunction
with supernova observations, \Planck\ is able to rule out a large class of inhomogeneous void models
as alternatives to dark energy or modified gravity. The \Planck\ constraints on peculiar velocities
and bulk flows are thus consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM scenario.
