(abridged) We present ALMA observations of hydrogen fluoride, HF J=1-0, H20 (202-211), and the
1.2 THz rest-frame continuum emission from the z=4.7 system BR1202-0725. BR1202-0725 is a galaxy
group consisting of a QSO, a sub-millimeter galaxy (SMG), and two Ly-alpha emitters. We detected
HF in emission in the QSO and possibly in absorption in the SMG, while water is detected in emission
in both the QSO and SMG. The QSO is the most luminous HF emitter yet found and has the same ratio of HF
emission line to infrared luminosity as a sample of local AGN and the Orion Bar. This consistency
covers about 10 orders-of-magnitude in infrared luminosity, L_IR. Based on the conclusions of
a study of HF emission in the Orion Bar and modeling, the HF emission in the QSO is either excited by
collisions with electrons and H2 in molecular plasmas irradiated by the AGN and intense star formation
or predominately by collisions with H2, with a modest contribution from electrons, in a relatively
high temperature (~120 K), dense (~10^5 cm^-3) medium. Although HF should be an excellent tracer
of molecular outflows, we do not find strong evidence for outflows in HF in either the QSO or the SMG.
From a putative absorption feature in HF in the SMG, we estimate an upper limit on the outflow rate,
dM/dt_outflow <~45 M_sun/yr. The ratio of the outflow rate to the star formation rate is <5% for the
SMG. The broadness of the H2O line in the SMG, FWHM~1020 km/s, may suggest that either the gas on large
scales (>4 kpc) is significantly more disturbed and turbulent due either to interactions and mass
exchange with the other members of the group or to the dissipation of the energy of the intense star
formation or both. The lack of significant molecular outflows in either source may imply that much
of the energy from the intense star formation and AGN activity in this pair is being dissipated in
their ISM.
