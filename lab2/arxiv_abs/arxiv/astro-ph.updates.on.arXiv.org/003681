We investigate the upper stellar mass limit set by radiative feedback by the forming star with various
accretion rates and metallicities. To this end, we numerically solve the structures of both a protostar
and its surrounding accretion envelope assuming a spherical symmetric and steady flow. The optical
depth of the dust cocoon, a dusty part of the accretion envelope, differs among the direct light from
the stellar photosphere and the diffuse light re-emitted as dust thermal emission. As a result,
varying the metallicity qualitatively changes the way that the radiative feedback suppresses
the accretion flow. With a fixed accretion rate of $10^{-3}M_{\odot} {\rm yr^{-1}}$, the both direct
and diffuse lights jointly operate to prevent the mass accretion at $Z \gtrsim 10^{-1}Z_{\odot}$.
At $Z \lesssim 10^{-1}Z_{\odot}$, the diffuse light is no longer effective, and the direct light
solely limits the mass accretion. At $Z \lesssim 10^{-3}Z_{\odot}$, the HII region formation plays
an important role in terminating the accretion. The resultant upper mass limit increases with decreasing
metallicity, from a few $\times~10~M_\odot$ to $\sim 10^3~M_\odot$ over $Z = 1Z_{\odot} - 10^{-4}~Z_\odot$.
We also illustrate how the radiation spectrum of massive star-forming cores changes with decreasing
metallicity. First, the peak wavelength of the spectrum, which is located around $30 \mu {\rm m}$
at $1Z_{\odot}$, shifts to $< 3 \mu {\rm m}$ at $Z \lesssim 0.1 Z_\odot$. Second, a characteristic
feature at $10 \mu \rm{m}$ due to the amorphous silicate band appears as a dip at $1Z_{\odot}$, but
changes to a bump at $Z \lesssim 0.1 Z_{\odot}$. Using these spectral signatures, we can search massive
accreting protostars in nearby low-metallicity environments with up-coming observations.
