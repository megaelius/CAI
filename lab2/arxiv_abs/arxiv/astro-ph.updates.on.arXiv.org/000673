Although the star itself is not He enriched, the periodicity and the variability in the UV wind lines
of the pulsating B1 IV star beta Cep are similar to what is observed in magnetic He-peculiar B stars,
suggesting that beta Cep is magnetic. We searched for a magnetic field using spectropolarimetry.
From UV spectroscopy, we analysed the wind variability and investigated the correlation with the
magnetic data. Using 130 time-resolved circular polarisation spectra, obtained with the MuSiCoS
spectropolarimeter at the 2m TBL from 1998 until 2005, we applied the least-squares deconvolution
method on the Stokes V spectra and derived the longitudinal component of the integrated magnetic
field over the visible hemisphere of the star. We performed a period analysis on the magnetic data
and on EW measurements of UV wind lines obtained over 17 years. We also analysed the short- and long-term
radial velocity variations, which are due to the pulsations and the 90-year binary motion. beta
Cep hosts a sinusoidally varying magnetic field with an amplitude 97(4) G and an average value -6(3)
G. From the UV wind line variability, we derive a period of 12.00075(11) days, which is the rotation
period of the star, and is compatible with the observed magnetic modulation. Phases of maximum and
minimum field match those of maximum emission in the UV wind lines, strongly supporting an oblique
magnetic-rotator model. We discuss the magnetic behaviour as a function of pulsation behaviour
and UV line variability. This paper presents the analysis of the first confirmed detection of a dipolar
magnetic field in an upper main-sequence pulsating star. Maximum wind absorption originates in
the magnetic equatorial plane. Maximum emission occurs when the magnetic north pole points to the
Earth. Radial velocities agree with the ~90-y orbit around its Be-star binary companion.
