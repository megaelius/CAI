We perform a suite of hydrodynamic simulations to investigate how initial density profiles of giant
molecular clouds (GMCs) affect their subsequent evolution. We find that the star formation duration
and integrated star formation efficiency of the whole clouds are not sensitive to the choice of different
profiles but are mainly controlled by the interplay between gravitational collapse and stellar
feedback. Despite this similarity, GMCs with different profiles show dramatically different
modes of star formation. For shallower profiles, GMCs first fragment into many self-gravitation
cores and form sub-clusters that distributed throughout the entire clouds. These sub-clusters
are later assembled ``hierarchically'' to central clusters. In contrast, for steeper profiles,
a massive cluster is quickly formed at the center of the cloud and then gradually grows its mass via
gas accretion. Consequently, central clusters that emerged from clouds with shallower profiles
are less massive and show less rotation than those with the steeper profiles. This is because 1) a
significant fraction of mass and angular momentum in shallower profiles is stored in the orbital
motion of the sub-clusters that are not able to merge into the central clusters 2) frequent hierarchical
mergers in the shallower profiles lead to further losses of mass and angular momentum via violent
relaxation and tidal disruption. Encouragingly, the degree of cluster rotations in steeper profiles
is consistent with recent observations of young and intermediate-age clusters. We speculate that
rotating globular clusters are likely formed via an ``accretion'' mode from centrally-concentrated
clouds in the early Universe.
