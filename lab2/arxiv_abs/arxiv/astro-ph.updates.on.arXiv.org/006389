We present the high angular resolution and high sensitivity images of the "Circum-Nuclear Disk
(CND)" and its surrounding region of Milky Way Galaxy in the CS J=2-1, SiO v=0 J=2-1, H^13CO^+ J=1-0,
C^34S J=2-1, and CH_3OH J_{K_a, K_c}=2_{1,1}-1_{1,0}A_{--} emission lines using ALMA. The CND
is recognized as a torus-like molecular gas with gaps in these emission lines except for the CH_3OH
emission line. The inner and outer radii of the CND are estimated to be R_in~1.5 and R_out~2 pc, respectively.
The velocities of the rotation and radial motion are estimated to be V_rot~115 km s^-1 and V_rad~23
km s^-1, respectively. The LTE molecular gas mass is estimated to be M_LTE~3x10^4 Mo. We also found
some anomalous molecular clouds in the surrounding region. One of the molecular clouds is positionally
connected to a part of the CND adjacent to the "Western Arc". However, the cloud is seen to rotate in
the opposite direction to the CND. The molecular cloud would be falling currently from the outer
region to the CND and being disrupted by the tidal shear of Sagittarius A*(Sgr A*) because the velocity
is not yet assimilated into that of the CND. Another molecular cloud is continuously connected to
the tip of the "Eastern Arm (EA)". The velocity of this cloud is consistent with that of the ionized
gas in the EA. These facts suggest that the molecular cloud is falling from the outer region to the
vicinity of Sgr A*, being disrupted by the tidal shear, and ionized by strong UV emission from the
Central Cluster because the impact parameter of the cloud is smaller than the first cloud. These
falling clouds would play an important role in transferring material from the outer region to the
CND and/or the vicinity of Sgr A*.
