Stripped-envelope stars (SESs) form in binary systems after losing mass through Roche-lobe overflow.
They bear astrophysical significance as sources of UV and ionizing radiation in older stellar populations
and, if sufficiently massive, as stripped supernova progenitors. Binary evolutionary models
predict them to be common, but only a handful of subdwarfs (i.e., SESs) with B-type companions are
known. This could be the result of observational biases hindering detection, or an incorrect understanding
of binary evolution. We reanalyze the well-studied post-interaction binary phi Persei. Recently,
new data improved the orbital solution of the system, which contains a ~1.2 Msun SES and a rapidly
rotating ~9.6 Msun Be star. We compare with an extensive grid of evolutionary models using a Bayesian
approach and find initial masses of the progenitor of 7.2+/-0.4 Msun for the SES and 3.8+/-0.4 Msun
for the Be star. The system must have evolved through near-conservative mass transfer. These findings
are consistent with earlier studies. The age we obtain, 57+/-9 Myr, is in excellent agreement with
the age of the alpha Persei cluster. We note that neither star was initially massive enough to produce
a core-collapse supernova, but mass exchange pushed the Be star above the mass threshold. We find
that the subdwarf is overluminous for its mass by almost an order of magnitude, compared to the expectations
for a helium core burning star. We can only reconcile this if the subdwarf is in a late phase of helium
shell burning, which lasts only 2-3% of the total lifetime as a subdwarf. This could imply that up
to ~50 less evolved, dimmer subdwarfs exist for each system similar to phi Persei. Our findings can
be interpreted as a strong indication that a substantial population of SESs indeed exists, but has
so far evaded detection because of observational biases and lack of large-scale systematic searches.
