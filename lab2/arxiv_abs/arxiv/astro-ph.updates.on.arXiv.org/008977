We compare the mass cooling rates and cumulative cooled-down masses predicted by several semi-analytical
(SA) cooling models with cosmological hydrodynamical simulations performed using the AREPO code
(ignoring processes such as feedback and chemical enrichment). The SA cooling models are the new
GALFORM cooling model introduced in Hou et al. (2017), along with two earlier GALFORM cooling models
and the L-GALAXIES and MORGANA cooling models. We find that the predictions of the new GALFORM cooling
model are generally in best agreement with the simulations. For halos with $M_{\rm halo}\lesssim
3\times 10^{11}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$, the SA models predict that the timescale for radiative cooling
is shorter than or comparable to the gravitational infall timescale. Even though SA models assume
that gas falls onto galaxies from a spherical gas halo, while the simulations show that the cold gas
is accreted through filaments, both methods predict similar mass cooling rates, because in both
cases the gas accretion occurs on similar timescales. For halos with $M_{\rm halo}\gtrsim 10^{12}\,{\rm
M}_{\odot}$, gas in the simulations typically cools from a roughly spherical hot gas halo, as assumed
in the SA models, but the halo gas gradually contracts during cooling, leading to compressional
heating. SA models ignore this heating, and so overestimate mass cooling rates by factors of a few.
At low redshifts halo major mergers or a sequence of successive smaller mergers are seen in the simulations
to strongly heat the halo gas and suppress cooling, while mergers at high redshifts do not suppress
cooling, because the gas filaments are difficult to heat up. The new SA cooling model best captures
these effects.
