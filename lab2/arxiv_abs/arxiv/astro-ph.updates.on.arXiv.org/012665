We present our chemical abundance investigation of the metal-poor ([Fe/H]=-1.60 dex), r-process-enriched
([Eu/Fe]=0.73 dex) halo star HD 20 using novel and archival high-resolution spectra at outstanding
signal-to-noise ratios. By combining one of the first asteroseismic gravity measurements in the
metal-poor regime from a TESS light curve with non-LTE analyses of iron lines, we derive a set of highly
accurate and precise stellar parameters. These allow us to delineate a chemical pattern comprised
of solid detections of 48 elements, including 28 neutron-capture elements, which establishes
HD 20 among the few benchmark stars that have almost complete patterns with low systematic dependencies
on the stellar parameters. Our light-element (Z<30) abundances are representative of other, similarly
metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo with contributions from core-collapse supernovae of type
II. A comparison to the scaled solar r-pattern shows that the lighter neutron-capture elements
(37<Z<60) are poorly matched. In particular, we find imprints of the weak r-process acting at low
metallicities. Nonetheless, by comparing our detailed abundances to the observed metal-poor
star BD +17 3248, we find a persistent residual pattern that is indicative of enrichment contributions
from the s-process. We show that mixing with material from predicted yields of massive, rotating
AGB stars at low metallicity considerably improves the fit. Based on a solar ratio of heavy- to light-s
elements -- at odds with model predictions for the i-process -- and a missing clear residual pattern
with respect to other stars with claimed contributions from this process, we refute (strong) contributions
from such astrophysical sites providing intermediate neutron densities. Finally, nuclear cosmochronology
is used to tie our detection of the radioactive element Th to an age estimate for HD 20 of $11.0\pm3.8$
