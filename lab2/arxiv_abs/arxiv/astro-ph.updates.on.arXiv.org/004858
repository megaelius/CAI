We test the efficacy of the energy-balance spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code Magphys
for recovering the spatially-resolved properties of a simulated isolated disc galaxy, for which
it was not designed. We perform 226,950 Magphys SED fits to regions between 0.2kpc and 25kpc in size
across the galaxy's disc, viewed from three different sight-lines, to probe how well Magphys can
recover key galaxy properties based on 21 bands of UV--far-infrared model photometry. Magphys
yields statistically acceptable fits to $> 99$ per cent of the pixels within the $r$-band effective
radius and between 59 and 77 per cent of pixels within 20kpc of the nucleus. Magphys is able to recover
the distribution of stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR, dust luminosity, dust
mass, and $V$-band attenuation reasonably well, especially when the pixel size is $> \sim1$ kpc,
whereas non-standard outputs (stellar metallicity and mass-weighted age) are recovered less
well. Accurate recovery is more challenging in the smallest sub-regions of the disc (pixel scale
$< \sim 1$ kpc), where the energy balance criterion becomes increasingly incorrect. Estimating
integrated galaxy properties by summing the recovered pixel values, the true integrated values
of all parameters considered except metallicity and age are well recovered at all spatial resolutions,
ranging from 0.2kpc to integrating across the disc, albeit with some evidence for resolution-dependent
biases. These results must be considered when attempting to analyse the structure of real galaxies
with actual observational data, for which the `ground truth' is unknown.
