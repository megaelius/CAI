In the past decade, a new class of bright transient radio sources with millisecond duration has been
discovered. The origin of these so-called Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is still a great mystery despite
the growing observational efforts made by various multi-wavelength and multi-messenger facilities.
So far, many models have been proposed to explain FRBs but neither the progenitors nor the radiative
and the particle acceleration processes at work have been clearly identified. In this paper, the
question whether some hadronic processes may occur in the vicinity of the FRB source is assessed.
If so, FRBs may contribute to the high energy cosmic-ray and neutrino fluxes. A search for these hadronic
signatures has been done using the ANTARES neutrino telescope. The analysis consists in looking
for high-energy neutrinos, in the TeV-PeV regime, spatially and temporally coincident with the
detected FRBs. Most of the FRBs discovered in the period 2013-2017 were in the field of view of the
ANTARES detector, which is sensitive mostly to events originating from the Southern hemisphere.
From this period, 12 FRBs have been selected and no coincident neutrino candidate was observed.
Upper limits on the per burst neutrino fluence have been derived using a power law spectrum, $\rm{\frac{dN}{dE_\nu}\propto
E_\nu^{-\gamma}}$, for the incoming neutrino flux, assuming spectral indexes $\gamma$ = 1.0,
2.0, 2.5. Finally, the neutrino energy has been constrained by computing the total energy radiated
in neutrinos assuming different distances for the FRBs. Constraints on the neutrino fluence and
on the energy released are derived from the associated null results.
