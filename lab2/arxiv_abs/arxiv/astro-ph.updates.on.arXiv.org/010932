In this paper we present the detailed formalism at the core of the Spectral Line Identification and
Modelling (SLIM) within the MAdrid Data CUBe Analysis (MADCUBA) package and their main data handling
functionalities. These tools have been developed to visualize, analyze and model large spectroscopic
data cubes. We present the highly interactive on-the-fly visualization and modelling tools of
MADCUBA and SLIM, which includes an stand-alone spectroscopic database. The parameters stored
therein are used to solve the full radiative transfer equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium
(LTE). SLIM provides tools to generate synthetic LTE model spectra based on input physical parameters
of column density, excitation temperature, velocity, line width and source size. SLIM also provides
an automatic fitting algorithm to obtain the physical parameters (with their associated errors)
better fitting the observations. Synthetic spectra can be overlayed in the data cubes/spectra
to easy the task of multi-molecular line identification and modelling.We present the Java-based
MADCUBA and its internal module SLIM packages which provide all the necessary tools for manipulation
and analysis of spectroscopic data cubes. We describe in detail the spectroscopic fitting equations
and make use of this tool to explore the breaking conditions and implicit errors of commonly used
approximations in the literature. Easy-to-use tools like MADCUBA allow the users to derive the
physical information from spectroscopic data without the need of resourcing to simple approximations.
SLIM allows to use the full radiative transfer equation, and to interactively explore the space
of physical parameters and associated uncertainties from observational data.
