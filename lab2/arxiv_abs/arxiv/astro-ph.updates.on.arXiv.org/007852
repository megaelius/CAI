Supernova (SN) 2018oh (ASASSN-18bt) is the first spectroscopically-confirmed type Ia supernova
(SN Ia) observed in the $Kepler$ field. The $Kepler$ data revealed an excess emission in its early
light curve, allowing to place interesting constraints on its progenitor system (Dimitriadis
et al. 2018, Shappee et al. 2018b). Here, we present extensive optical, ultraviolet, and near-infrared
photometry, as well as dense sampling of optical spectra, for this object. SN 2018oh is relatively
normal in its photometric evolution, with a rise time of 18.3$\pm$0.3 days and $\Delta$m$_{15}(B)=0.96\pm$0.03
mag, but it seems to have bluer $B - V$ colors. We construct the "uvoir" bolometric light curve having
peak luminosity as 1.49$\times$10$^{43}$erg s$^{-1}$, from which we derive a nickel mass as 0.55$\pm$0.04M$_{\odot}$
by fitting radiation diffusion models powered by centrally located $^{56}$Ni. Note that the moment
when nickel-powered luminosity starts to emerge is +3.85 days after the first light in the Kepler
data, suggesting other origins of the early-time emission, e.g., mixing of $^{56}$Ni to outer layers
of the ejecta or interaction between the ejecta and nearby circumstellar material or a non-degenerate
companion star. The spectral evolution of SN 2018oh is similar to that of a normal SN Ia, but is characterized
by prominent and persistent carbon absorption features. The C II features can be detected from the
early phases to about 3 weeks after the maximum light, representing the latest detection of carbon
ever recorded in a SN Ia. This indicates that a considerable amount of unburned carbon exists in the
ejecta of SN 2018oh and may mix into deeper layers.
