Recent work has suggested extreme [OIII] emitting star-forming galaxies are important to reionization.
Relatedly, [OIII]/[OII] has been put forward as an indirect estimator of the Lyman Continuum (LyC)
escape fraction ($f_{esc}$) at $z\gtrsim4.5$ when the opaque IGM renders LyC photons unobservable.
Using deep archival U-band (VLT/VIMOS) imaging of a recently confirmed overdensity at $z\sim3.5$
we calculate tight constraints on $f_{esc}$ for a sample (N=73) dominated by extreme [OIII] emitters.
We find no Lyman Continuum signal ($f_{esc}^{rel} < 6.3^{+0.7}_{-0.7} \%$ at $1\sigma$) in a deep
U-band stack of our sample (31.98 mag at 1$\sigma$). This constraint is in agreement with recent
studies of star-forming galaxies spanning $z\sim1-4$ that have found very low average $f_{esc}$.
Despite the galaxies in our study having an estimated average rest-frame EW([OIII]$\lambda5007$)$\sim400\AA$
and [OIII]/[OII]$\sim 4$ from composite SED-fitting, we find no LyC detection, which brings into
question the potential of [OIII]/[OII] as an effective probe of the LyC--a majority of LyC emitters
have [OIII]/[OII]$>3$, but we establish here that [OIII]/[OII]$>3$ does not guarantee significant
LyC leakage for a population. Since even extreme star-forming galaxies are unable to produce the
$f_{esc}\sim10-15\%$ required by most theoretical calculations for star-forming galaxies to
drive reionization, there must either be a rapid evolution of $f_{esc}$ between $z\sim3.5$ and
the Epoch of Reionization, or hitherto observationally unstudied sources (e.g. ultra-faint low-mass
galaxies with $\log(M/M_\odot)\sim7-8.5$) must make an outsized contribution to reionization.
