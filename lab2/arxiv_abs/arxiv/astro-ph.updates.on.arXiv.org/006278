We present ALMA observations of the 870$\mu$m continuum and CO(4-3) line emission in the core of
the galaxy cluster ClJ1449+0856 at z=2, a NIR-selected, X-ray detected system in the mass range
of typical progenitors of today's massive clusters. The 870$\mu$m map reveals six F$_{870\mu m}$
> 0.5 mJy sources spread over an area of 0.07 arcmin$^2$, giving an overdensity of a factor ~10 (6)
with respect to blank field counts down to F$_{870\mu m}$ > 1 (0.5) mJy. On the other hand, deep CO(4-3)
follow-up confirms membership of three of these sources, but suggests that the remaining three,
including the brightest 870$\mu$m sources in the field (F$_{870\mu m}\gtrsim$2 mJy), are likely
interlopers. The measurement of 870$\mu$m continuum and CO(4-3) line fluxes at the positions of
previously-known cluster members provides a deep probe of dusty star formation occurring in the
core of this high-redshift structure, adding up to a total SFR~700$\pm$100 M$_{\odot}$/yr and
yielding an integrated star formation rate density of ~10$^4$ M$_{\odot}$/yr/Mpc$^3$, five orders
of magnitude larger than in the field at the same epoch, due to the concentration of star-forming
galaxies in the small volume of the dense cluster core. The combination of these observations with
previously available HST imaging highlights the presence in this same volume of a population of
galaxies with already suppressed star formation. This diverse composition of galaxy populations
in ClJ1449+0856 is especially highlighted at the very cluster center, where a complex assembly
of quiescent and star-forming sources is likely forming the future Brightest Cluster Galaxy.
