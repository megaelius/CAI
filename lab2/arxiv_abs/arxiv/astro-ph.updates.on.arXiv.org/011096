Despite significant progress both observationally and theoretically, the origin of high-ionization
nebular HeII emission in galaxies dominated by stellar photoionization remains unclear. Accretion-powered
radiation from high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) is still one of the leading proposed explanations
for the missing $\mathrm{He^+}$-ionizing photons, but this scenario has yet to be conclusively
tested. In this paper, we present nebular line predictions from a grid of photoionization models
with input SEDs containing the joint contribution of both stellar atmospheres and a multi-color
disk model for HMXBs. This grid demonstrates that HMXBs are inefficient producers of the photons
necessary to power HeII, and can only boost this line substantially in galaxies with HMXB populations
large enough to power X-ray luminosities of $10^{42}$ erg/s per unit star formation rate (SFR).
To test this, we assemble a sample of eleven low-redshift star-forming galaxies with high-quality
constraints on both X-ray emission from Chandra and HeII emission from deep optical spectra, including
new observations with the MMT. These data reveal that the HMXB populations of these nearby systems
are insufficient to account for the observed HeII strengths, with typical X-ray luminosities or
upper limits thereon of only $10^{40}$-$10^{41}$ erg/s per SFR. This indicates that HMXBs are not
the dominant source of $\mathrm{He^+}$ ionization in these metal-poor star-forming galaxies.
We suggest that the solution may instead reside in revisions to stellar wind predictions, softer
X-ray sources, or very hot products of binary evolution at low metallicity.
