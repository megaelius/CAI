We obtained the absolute magnitudes, distances, and white dwarf (WD) masses of 32 recent galactic
novae based on the time-stretching method for nova light curves. A large part of the light/color
curves of two classical novae often overlap each other if we properly squeeze/stretch their timescales.
Then, a target nova brightness is related to the other template nova brightness by $(M_V[t])_{\rm
template} = (M_V[t/f_{\rm s}] - 2.5 \log f_{\rm s})_{\rm target}$, where $t$ is the time, $M_V[t]$
is the absolute $V$ magnitude, and $f_{\rm s}$ is their timescaling ratio. Moreover, when these
two time-stretched light curves, $(t/f_{\rm s})$-$(M_V-2.5 \log f_{\rm s})$, overlap each other,
$(t/f_{\rm s})$-$(B-V)_0$ do too, where $(B-V)_0$ is the intrinsic $B-V$ color. Thus, the two nova
tracks overlap each other in the $(B-V)_0$-$(M_V-2.5 \log f_{\rm s})$ diagram. Inversely using
these properties, we obtain/confirm the distance and reddening by comparing each nova light/color
curves with the well calibrated template novae. We classify the 32 novae into two types, LV Vul and
V1500 Cyg types, in the time-stretched $(B-V)_0$-$(M_V-2.5 \log f_{\rm s})$ color-magnitude
diagram. The WD mass is obtained by direct comparison of the model $V$ light curves with the observation.
Thus, we obtain a uniform set of 32 galactic classical novae that provides the distances and WD masses
from a single method. Many novae broadly follow the universal decline law and the present method
can be applied to them, while some novae largely deviate from the universal decline law and so the
method cannot be directly applied to them. We discuss such examples.
