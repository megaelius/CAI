Context. Solar activity is often accompanied by solar radio emission, consisting of numerous types
of solar radio bursts. At low frequencies (<100 MHz) radio bursts with short durations of milliseconds,
such as solar S-bursts, have been identified. To date, their origin and many of their characteristics
remain unclear. Aims. We report observations from the Ukrainian T-shaped Radio telescope, (UTR-2),
and the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) which give us new insight into their nature. Methods. Over 3000
S-bursts were observed on 9 July 2013 at frequencies of 17.4-83.1 MHz during a period of low solar
activity. Leading models of S-burst generation were tested by analysing the spectral properties
of S-bursts and estimating coronal magnetic field strengths. Results. S-bursts were found to have
short durations of 0.5-0.9 s. Multiple instruments were used to measure the dependence of drift
rate on frequency which is represented by a power law with an index of 1.57. For the first time, we show
a linear relation between instantaneous bandwidth and frequency over a wide frequency band. The
flux calibration and high sensitivity of UTR-2 enabled measurements of their fluxes, which yielded
11+3 SFU. The source particle velocities of S-bursts were found to be ~0.07 c. S-burst source heights
were found to range from 1.3 R_Sun to 2 R_Sun. Furthermore, a contemporary theoretical model of S-burst
generation was used to conduct remote sensing of the coronal magnetic field at these heights which
yielded values of 0.9-5.8 G. Within error, these values are comparable to those predicted by various
relations between magnetic field strength and height in the corona.
