Carbon-deficient red giants (CDRGs) are a rare class of peculiar red giants, also called "weak G-band"
or "weak-CH" stars. Their atmospheric compositions show depleted carbon, a low 12C/13C isotopic
ratio, and an overabundance of nitrogen, indicating that the material at the surface has undergone
CN-cycle hydrogen-burning. I present Stromgren uvby photometry of nearly all known CDRGs. Barium
stars, having an enhanced carbon abundance, exhibit the "Bond-Neff effect"--a broad depression
in their energy distributions at ~4000 A, recently confirmed to be due to the CH molecule. This gives
Ba II stars unusually low Stromgren c1 photometric indices. I show that CDRGs, lacking CH absorption,
exhibit an "anti-Bond-Neff effect": higher c1 indices than normal red giants. Using precise parallaxes
from Gaia DR2, I plot CDRGs in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) and compare them with theoretical
evolution tracks. Most CDRGs lie in a fairly tight clump in the CMD, indicating initial masses in
the range ~2 to 3.5 Msun, if they have evolved as single stars. It is unclear whether they are stars
that have just reached the base of the red-giant branch and the first dredge-up of CN-processed material,
or are more highly evolved helium-burning stars in the red-giant clump. About 10% of CDRGs have higher
masses of ~4 to 4.5 Msun, and exhibit unusually high rotational velocities. I show that CDRGs lie
at systematically larger distances from the Galactic plane than normal giants, possibly indicating
a role of binary mass-transfer and mergers. CDRGs continue to present a major puzzle for our understanding
of stellar evolution.
