We present high spatial resolution observations of ground-state OH masers achieved with the Australia
Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). These observations targeted 253 pointing centres containing
OH maser candidates at all four ground-state OH transitions identified in the Southern Parkes Large-Area
Survey in Hydroxyl (SPLASH) across 96 square degrees of the Southern Galactic plane (332\degree$<l<$334\degree
and $-$2\degree$<b<+$2\degree, 344\degree$<l<$355\degree and $-$2\degree$<b<+$2\degree,
358\degree$<l<$4\degree and $+$2\degree$<b<+$6\degree, 5\degree$<l<$10\degree and $-$2\degree$<b<+$2\degree).
We detect maser emission towards 236 fields and suggest that 7 out of 17 non-detections are due to
the slightly lower sensitivity of the ATCA observations, combined with some temporal variability.
The superior resolution provided by the ATCA data has allowed us to identify 362 OH maser sites in
the 236 target fields. Almost half (160 of 362) of these masers have been detected for the first time.
Comparison between these 362 maser sites with information presented in the literature allowed
us to categorize 238 sites as evolved star sites (66\%), 63 as star formation (17\%), eight as supernova
remnants and 53 unknown maser sites (15\%). We present analysis of the OH masers across the full SPLASH
survey range (176 square degrees) and find that the detection rate of 1.7 GHz radio continuum sources
(18\%) is lower than that previously found at 8.2 and 9.2 GHz (38\%). We also find that the velocity
separations of evolved star sites with symmetric 1612 MHz maser profiles are generally smaller
than those with asymmetric profiles.
