Context. Stellar shells, forming axially symmetric systems of arcs in some elliptical galaxies,
are likely remnants of radial minor mergers. They are observed up the radius of ~100 kpc. The stars
in them oscillate in radial orbits. The radius of a shell depends on the free-fall time at the position
of the shell and on the time since the merger. In B\'ilek et al. (2013), we verified the consistency
of shell radii in the elliptical galaxy NGC 3923 with its most probable MOND potential. Our results
implied that a yet undiscovered shell exists at the outskirts of the galaxy. Aims. In the present
paper, we extend our study assuming more general models for gravitational potential to verify the
prediction of the new shell and to estimate its position. Methods. We test the consistency of the
shell radial distribution observed in NGC 3923 with a wide variety of MOND potentials of the galaxy.
The potentials differ in the mass-to-light ratio and the distance of the galaxy. We consider different
MOND interpolation functions, values of the acceleration constant a0, and density profiles of
the galaxy. We verify the functionality of our code on a Newtonian self-consistent simulation of
the formation of a shell galaxy. Results. Our method gives a robust prediction that exactly one new
outermost shell exists at galactocentric radius of around 1900'' (~210 kpc) on the south-western
side of the galaxy. Its estimated surface brightness is around 28mag/arcsec2 in B - a value accessible
by the current instruments. This prediction enables a rare test of MOND in an elliptical down to the
acceleration of a0/10. The predictive power of our method is verified by reconstructing the position
of the largest known shell from the distribution of the remaining shells.
