Robustly modeling the inner edge of the habitable zone is essential for determining the most promising
potentially habitable exoplanets for atmospheric characterization. Global climate models (GCMs)
have become the standard tool for calculating this boundary, but divergent results have emerged
among the various GCMs. In this study, we perform an inter-comparison of standard GCMs used in the
field on a rapidly rotating planet receiving a G-star spectral energy distribution and on a tidally
locked planet receiving an M-star spectral energy distribution. Experiments both with and without
clouds are examined. We find relatively small difference (within 8 K) in global-mean surface temperature
simulation among the models in the G-star case with clouds. In contrast, the global-mean surface
temperature simulation in the M-star case is highly divergent (20-30 K). Moreover, even differences
in the simulated surface temperature when clouds are turned off are significant. These differences
are caused by differences in cloud simulation and/or radiative transfer, as well as complex interactions
between atmospheric dynamics and these two processes. For example we find that an increase in atmospheric
absorption of shortwave radiation can lead to higher relative humidity at high altitudes globally
and, therefore, a significant decrease in planetary radiation emitted to space. This study emphasizes
the importance of basing conclusions about planetary climate on simulations from a variety of GCMs
and motivates the eventual comparison of GCM results with terrestrial exoplanet observations
to improve their performance.
