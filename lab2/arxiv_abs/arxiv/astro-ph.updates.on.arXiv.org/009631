We present the Census of the Local Universe (CLU) narrow-band survey to search for emission-line
(\ha) galaxies. CLU-\ha~has imaged $\approx$3$\pi$ of the sky (26,470~deg$^2$) with 4 narrow-band
filters that probe a distance out to 200~Mpc. We have obtained spectroscopic follow-up for galaxy
candidates in 14 preliminary fields (101.6~deg$^2$) to characterize the limits and completeness
of the survey. In these preliminary fields, CLU can identify emission lines down to an \ha~flux limit
of $10^{-14}$~$\rm{erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}}$ at 90\% completeness, and recovers 83\% (67\%) of the
\ha~flux from catalogued galaxies in our search volume at the $\Sigma$=2.5 ($\Sigma$=5) color
excess levels. The contamination from galaxies with no emission lines is 61\% (12\%) for $\Sigma$=2.5
($\Sigma$=5). Also, in the regions of overlap between our preliminary fields and previous emission-line
surveys, we recover the majority of the galaxies found in previous surveys and identify an additional
$\approx$300 galaxies. In total, we find 90 galaxies with no previous distance information, several
of which are interesting objects: 7 blue compact dwarfs, 1 green pea, and a Seyfert galaxy; we also
identified a known planetary nebula. These objects show that the CLU-\ha~survey can be a discovery
machine for objects in our own Galaxy and extreme galaxies out to intermediate redshifts. However,
the majority of the CLU-\ha~galaxies identified in this work show properties consistent with normal
star-forming galaxies. CLU-\ha~galaxies with new redshifts will be added to existing galaxy catalogs
to focus the search for the electromagnetic counterpart to gravitational wave events.
