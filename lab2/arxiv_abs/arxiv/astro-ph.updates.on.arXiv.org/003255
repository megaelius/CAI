(349) Dembowska, a large, bright main-belt asteroid, has a fast rotation and oblique spin axis.
It may have experienced partial melting and differentiation. We constrain Dembowska's thermophysical
properties, e.g., thermal inertia, roughness fraction, geometric albedo and effective diameter
within 3$\sigma$ uncertainty of $\Gamma=20^{+12}_{-7}\rm~Jm^{-2}s^{-0.5}K^{-1}$, $f_{\rm
r}=0.25^{+0.60}_{-0.25}$, $p_{\rm v}=0.309^{+0.026}_{-0.038}$, and $D_{\rm eff}=155.8^{+7.5}_{-6.2}\rm~km$,
by utilizing the Advanced Thermophysical Model (ATPM) to analyse four sets of thermal infrared
data obtained by IRAS, AKARI, WISE and Subaru/COMICS at different epochs. In addition, by modeling
the thermal lightcurve observed by WISE, we obtain the rotational phases of each dataset. These
rotationally resolved data do not reveal significant variations of thermal inertia and roughness
across the surface, indicating the surface of Dembowska should be covered by a dusty regolith layer
with few rocks or boulders. Besides, the low thermal inertia of Dembowska show no significant difference
with other asteroids larger than 100 km, indicating the dynamical lives of these large asteroids
are long enough to make the surface to have sufficiently low thermal inertia. Furthermore, based
on the derived surface thermophysical properties, as well as the known orbital and rotational parameters,
we can simulate Dembowska's surface and subsurface temperature throughout its orbital period.
The surface temperature varies from $\sim40$ K to $\sim220$ K, showing significant seasonal variation,
whereas the subsurface temperature achieves equilibrium temperature about $120\sim160$ K below
$30\sim50$ cm depth.
