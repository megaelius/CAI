We discuss the effects on the CMB, CIB, and thermal SZ effect due to the peculiar motion of an observer
with respect to the CMB rest frame, which induces boosting effects. We investigate the scientific
perspectives opened by future CMB space missions, focussing on the CORE proposal. The improvements
in sensitivity offered by a mission like CORE, together with its high resolution over a wide frequency
range, will provide a more accurate estimate of the CMB dipole. The extension of boosting effects
to polarization and cross-correlations will enable a more robust determination of purely velocity-driven
effects that are not degenerate with the intrinsic CMB dipole, allowing us to achieve a S/N ratio
of 13; this improves on the Planck detection and essentially equals that of an ideal cosmic-variance-limited
experiment up to a multipole l of 2000. Precise inter-frequency calibration will offer the opportunity
to constrain or even detect CMB spectral distortions, particularly from the cosmological reionization,
because of the frequency dependence of the dipole spectrum, without resorting to precise absolute
calibration. The expected improvement with respect to COBE-FIRAS in the recovery of distortion
parameters (in principle, a factor of several hundred for an ideal experiment with the CORE configuration)
ranges from a factor of several up to about 50, depending on the quality of foreground removal and
relative calibration. Even for 1% accuracy in both foreground removal and relative calibration
at an angular scale of 1 deg, we find that dipole analyses for a mission like CORE will be able to improve
the recovery of the CIB spectrum amplitude by a factor of 17 in comparison with current results based
on FIRAS. In addition to the scientific potential of a mission like CORE for these analyses, synergies
with other planned and ongoing projects are also discussed.
