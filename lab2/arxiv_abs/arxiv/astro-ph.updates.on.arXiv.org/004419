Terrestrial planets are thought to experience episode(s) of large-scale melting early in their
history. Fractionation during magma-ocean freezing leads to unstable stratification within
the related cumulate layers due to progressive iron enrichment upward, but the effects of incremental
cumulate overturns during MO crystallization remain to be explored. Here, we use geodynamic models
with a moving-boundary approach to study convection and mixing within the growing cumulate layer,
and thereafter within the fully crystallized mantle. For fractional crystallization, cumulates
are efficiently stirred due to subsequent incremental overturns, except for strongly iron-enriched
late-stage cumulates, which persist as a stably stratified layer at the base of the mantle for billions
of years. Less extreme crystallization scenarios can lead to somewhat more subtle stratification.
In any case, the long-term preservation of at least a thin layer of extremely enriched cumulates
with Fe#>0.4, as predicted by all our models, is inconsistent with seismic constraints. Based on
scaling relationships, however, we infer that final-stage Fe-rich magma-ocean cumulates originally
formed near the surface should have overturned as small diapirs, and hence undergone melting and
reaction with the host rock during sinking. The resulting moderately iron-enriched metasomatized/hybrid
rock assemblages should have accumulated at the base of the mantle, potentially fed an intermittent
basal magma ocean, and be preserved through the present-day. Such moderately iron-enriched rock
assemblages can reconcile the physical properties of the large low shear-wave velocity provinces
in the presentday lower mantle. Thus, we reveal Hadean melting and rock-reaction processes by integrating
magmaocean crystallization models with the seismic-tomography snapshot.
