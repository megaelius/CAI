Context: NGC 7538 IRS 1-3 is a high-mass star-forming cluster with several detected dust cores,
infrared sources, (ultra)compact H$_{\rm II}$ regions, molecular outflows, and masers. In such
a complex environment, important interactions and feedback among the embedded objects are expected
to play a major role in the evolution of the region. Aims: We study the dust, kinematic, and polarimetric
properties of the NGC 7538 IRS 1-3 region to investigate the role of the different forces interplaying
in the formation and evolution of high-mass star-forming clusters. Methods: We perform SMA high
angular resolution observations at 880 $\mu$m with the compact configuration. We develop the RATPACKS
code to generate synthetic velocity cubes from models of choice to be compared to the observational
data. We develop the "mass balance" analysis to quantify the stability against gravitational collapse
accounting for all the energetics at core scales. Results: We detect 14 dust cores from 3.5 $M_{\odot}$
to 37 $M_{\odot}$ arranged in two larger scale structures: a central bar and a filamentary spiral
arm. The spiral arm presents large scale velocity gradients in H$^{13}$CO$^+$ 4-3 and C$^{17}$O
3-2, and magnetic field segments well aligned to the dust main axis. The velocity gradient is well
reproduced by a spiral arm expanding at 9 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the central core MM1, which is
known to power a large precessing outflow. The energy of the outflow is comparable with the spiral
arm kinetic energy, which is dominant over gravitational and magnetic energies. In addition, the
dynamical ages of the outflow and spiral arm are comparable. ... (Full abstract in the pdf version)
