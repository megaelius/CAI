The thermal-to-nonthermal partition was found to vary greatly from one flare to another resulting
in a broad variety of cases from 'heating without acceleration' to 'acceleration without heating'.
Recent analysis of microwave data of these differing cases suggests that a similar acceleration
mechanism, forming a power-law nonthermal tail up to a few MeV or even higher, operates in all the
cases. However, the level of this nonthermal spectrum compared to the original thermal distribution
differs significantly from one case to another, implying a highly different thermal-to-nonthermal
energy partition in various cases. This further requires a specific mechanism capable of extracting
the charged particles from the thermal pool and supplying them to a bulk acceleration process to
operate in flares \textit{in addition} to the bulk acceleration process itself, which, in contrast,
efficiently accelerates the seed particles, while cannot accelerate the thermal particles. Within
this 'microwave' view on the flare energy partition and particle acceleration I present a few contrasting
examples of acceleration regions detected with microwave data and compare them with the most popular
acceleration mechanisms---in DC fields, in collapsing traps, and stochastic acceleration by
a turbulence spectrum - to identify the key elements needed to conform with observations. In particular,
I point out that the turbulence needed to drive the particle acceleration is generated in nonpotential
magnetic structures, which results in nonzero helicity of the turbulence. This helicity, in its
turn, produces a nonzero mean DC electric field on top of stochastic turbulent fields driving the
main stochastic acceleration; thus, acceleration by helical turbulence combines properties
of the standard stochastic acceleration with some features of acceleration in DC electric fields,
exactly what is demanded by observation.
