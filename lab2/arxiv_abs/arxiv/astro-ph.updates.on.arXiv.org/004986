Recently a remarkable relation has been demonstrated between the observed radial acceleration
in disk galaxies and the acceleration predicted on the basis of baryonic matter alone. Here we study
this relation within the framework of the modified gravity model MOND. The field equations of MOND
automatically imply the radial acceleration relation for spherically symmetric galaxies, but
for disk galaxies deviations from the relation are expected. Here we investigate whether these
deviations are of sufficient magnitude to bring MOND into conflict with the observed relation.
In the quasilinear formulation of MOND, to calculate the gravitational field of a given distribution
of matter, an intermediate step is to calculate the "pristine field", which is a simple nonlinear
function of the Newtonian field corresponding to the same distribution of matter. Hence, to the
extent that the quasilinear gravitational field is approximately equal to the pristine field,
the radial acceleration relation will be satisfied. We show that the difference between the quasilinear
and pristine fields obeys the equations of magnetostatics, the curl of the pristine field serves
as the source for the difference in the two fields, much as currents serve as sources for the magnetic
field. Using the magnetostatic analogy we numerically study the difference between the pristine
and quasilinear fields for simple model galaxies with a Gaussian profile. Our principal finding
is that the difference between the fields is small compared to the observational uncertainties
and that quasilinear MOND is therefore compatible with the observed radial acceleration relation.
