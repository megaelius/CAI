We present the results of a systematic mapping of seasonally sculpted terrains on the South Polar
region of Mars with the Planet Four: Terrains (P4T) online citizen science project. P4T enlists
members of the general public to visually identify features in the publicly released Mars Reconnaissance
Orbiter CTX images. In particular, P4T volunteers are asked to identify: 1) araneiforms (including
features with a central pit and radiating channels known as 'spiders'); 2) erosional depressions,
troughs, mesas, ridges, and quasi-circular pits characteristic of the South Polar Residual Cap
(SPRC) which we collectively refer to as 'Swiss cheese terrain', and 3) craters. In this work we present
the distributions of our high confidence classic spider araneiforms and Swiss cheese terrain identifications.
We find no locations within our high confidence spider sample that also have confident Swiss cheese
terrain identifications. Previously spiders were reported as being confined to the South Polar
Layered Deposits (SPLD). Our work has provided the first identification of spiders at locations
outside of the SPLD, confirmed with high resolution HiRISE imaging. We find araneiforms on the Amazonian
and Hesperian polar units and the Early Noachian highland units, with 75% of the identified araneiform
locations in our high confidence sample residing on the SPLD. With our current coverage, we cannot
confirm whether these are the only geologic units conducive to araneiform formation on the Martian
South Polar region. Our results are consistent with the current CO2 jet formation scenario with
the process exploiting weaknesses in the surface below the seasonal CO2 ice sheet to carve araneiform
channels into the regolith over many seasons. These new regions serve as additional probes of the
conditions required for channel creation in the CO2 jet process. (Abridged)
