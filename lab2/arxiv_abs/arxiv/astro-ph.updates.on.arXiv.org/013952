KELT-9 b, the hottest known exoplanet with $T\sim4400$ K, is the archetype of a new planet class known
as ultra-hot Jupiters. These exoplanets are presumed to have an atmosphere dominated by neutral
and ionized atomic species. In particular, H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ Balmer lines have been detected
in the KELT-9 b upper atmosphere, suggesting that hydrogen is filling the planetary Roche lobe and
escaping from the planet. In this work, we detected $\delta$ Scuti-type stellar pulsation (with
a period $P=7.54\pm0.12$ h) and studied the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect (finding a spin-orbit
angle $\lambda=-85.01^{\deg}\pm0.23^{\deg}$) prior to focussing on the Balmer lines (H$\alpha$
to H$\zeta$) in the optical transmission spectrum of KELT-9 b. Our HARPS-N data show significant
absorption for H$\alpha$ to H$\delta$. The precise line shapes of the H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and
H$\gamma$ absorptions allow us to put constraints on the thermospheric temperature. Moreover,
the mass loss rate, and the excited hydrogen population of KELT-9 b are also constrained, thanks
to a retrieval analysis performed with a new atmospheric model. We retrieved a thermospheric temperature
of $T=13200^{+800}_{-720}$ K and a mass loss rate of $\dot{M}=10^{12.8\pm0.3}$ g s$^{-1}$ when
the atmosphere was assumed to be in hydrodynamical expansion and in local thermodynamic equilibrium
(LTE). Since the thermospheres of hot Jupiters are not expected to be in LTE, we explored atmospheric
structures with non-Boltzmann equilibrium for the population of the excited hydrogen. We do not
find strong statistical evidence in favor of a departure from LTE. However, our non-LTE scenario
suggests that a departure from the Boltzmann equilibrium may not be sufficient to explain the retrieved
low number densities of the excited hydrogen. In non-LTE, Saha equilibrium departure via photo-ionization,
is also likely to be necessary to explain the data.
