Deuterium and lithium are light elements of high cosmological and astrophysical importance. In
this work we report the first detection of deuterated molecules and a search for lithium hydride,
7LiH, at redshift z=0.89 in the spiral galaxy intercepting the line of sight to the quasar PKS1830-211.
We used ALMA to observe several submillimeter lines of ND, NH2D, and HDO, and their related isotopomers
NH2, NH3, and H2^18O, in absorption against the southwest image of the quasar, allowing us to derive
XD/XH abundance ratios. The absorption spectra mainly consist of two distinct narrow velocity
components for which we find remarkable differences. One velocity component shows XD/XH abundances
that is about 10 times larger than the primordial elemental D/H ratio, and no variability of the absorption
profile during the time span of our observations. [...] The second component has XD/XH abundances
that are 100 times larger than the primordial D/H ratio, a deepening of the absorption by a factor
of two within a few months, and a rich chemical composition, with relative enhancements of N2H+,
CH3OH, SO2, and complex organic molecules. We therefore speculate that this component is associated
with the analog of a Galactic dark cloud, while the first component is likely more diffuse. Our search
for the 7LiH (1--0) line was unsuccessful and we derive an upper limit 7LiH/H2 = 4 x 10^-13 (3sigma)
in the z=0.89 absorber toward PKS1830-211. Besides, with ALMA archival data, we could not confirm
the previous tentative detections of this line in the z=0.68 absorber toward B0218+357; we derive
an upper limit 7LiH/H2 = 5 x 10^-11 (3sigma), although this is less constraining than our limit toward
PKS1830-211. We conclude that, as in the Milky Way, only a tiny fraction of lithium nuclei are possibly
bound in LiH in these absorbers at intermediate redshift.
