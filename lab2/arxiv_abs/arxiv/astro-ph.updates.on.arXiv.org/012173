We explore the high spectral resolution X-ray data towards the quasar 3C273 to search for signals
of hot ($\sim10^{6-7}$ K) X-ray-absorbing gas co-located with two established intergalactic
FUV OVI absorbers. We analyze the soft X-ray band grating data of all XMM-Newton and Chandra instruments
to search for the hot phase absorption lines at the FUV predicted redshifts. The viability of potential
line detections is examined by adopting the constraints of a physically justified absorption model.
The WHIM hypothesis is investigated with a complementary 3D galaxy distribution analysis, and
by comparison of the measurement results to the WHIM properties in the EAGLE cosmological, hydrodynamical
simulation. At FUV redshift z=0.09017, we measured signals of two hot ion species, OVIII and NeIX,
with a $3.9\sigma$ combined significance level. Considering the line features in all instruments
collectively and assuming collisional equilibrium for absorbing gas, we were able to constrain
the temperature ($kT=0.26\pm0.03$ keV) and the column density ($N_H\times{Z_\odot/Z}=1.3_{-0.5}^{+0.6}\times10^{19}$
cm$^{-2}$) of the absorber. Thermal analysis indicates that FUV and X-ray absorption relate to
different phases, with estimated temperatures $T_{FUV}\approx3\times10^5$ and $T_{X-ray}\approx3\times10^6$
K, which match the EAGLE predictions for WHIM at the FUV/X-ray measured $N_{ion}$-ranges. We detected
a large scale galactic filament crossing the sightline at the redshift of the absorption, linking
the absorption to this structure. This study provides insights into co-existing warm and hot gas
within a WHIM filament and estimates the ratio of the hot and warm phases. Because the hot phase is
thermally distinct from the OVI gas, the estimated baryon content of the absorber is increased,
conveying the promise of X-ray follow-up studies of FUV detected WHIM in refining the picture of
the missing baryons.
