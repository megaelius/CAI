We present the catalogue and properties of sources in AS2UDS, an 870-$\mu$m continuum survey with
the Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) of 716 single-dish sub-millimetre
sources detected in the UKIDSS/UDS field by the SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey. In our sensitive
ALMA follow-up observations we detect 708 sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) at $>$\,4.3$\sigma$
significance across the $\sim$\,1-degree diameter field. We combine our precise ALMA positions
with the extensive multi-wavelength coverage in the UDS field to fit the spectral energy distributions
of our SMGs to derive a median redshift of $z_{\rm phot}=$\,2.61$\pm$0.09. This large sample reveals
a statistically significant trend of increasing sub-millimetre flux with redshift suggestive
of galaxy downsizing. 101 ALMA maps do not show a $>$\,4.3$\sigma$ SMG, but we demonstrate from stacking
{\it Herschel} SPIRE observations at these positions, that the vast majority of these blank maps
correspond to real single-dish sub-millimetre sources. We further show that these blank maps contain
an excess of galaxies at $z_{\rm phot}=$\,1.5--4 compared to random fields, similar to the redshift
range of the ALMA-detected SMGs. In addition, we combine X-ray and mid-infrared active galaxy nuclei
activity (AGN) indicators to yield a likely range for the AGN fraction of 8--28\,\% in our sample.
Finally, we compare the redshifts of this population of high-redshift, strongly star-forming
galaxies with the inferred formation redshifts of massive, passive galaxies being found out to
$z\sim$\,2, finding reasonable agreement -- in support of an evolutionary connection between
these two classes of massive galaxy.
