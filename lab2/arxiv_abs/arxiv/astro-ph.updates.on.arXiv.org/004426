We study the temporal and spectral characteristics of SMC X-3 during its 2016 outburst. To probe
accretion onto highly magnetized neutron stars (NSs), at the Eddington limit. We obtained XMM-Newton
observations of SMC X-3 and combined them with long-term observations by Swift. We studied the temporal
and spectral behavior of the source, and its short- and long-term evolution. We constructed a simple
toy-model to gain insight into the complex emission pattern of SMC X-3. We confirm the pulse period
of the system, derived by previous works and note that the pulse has a complex, three peaked shape.
We find that the pulsed emission is dominated by hard photons, while at energies below ~1 keV, the
emission is virtually non-pulsating. We further find that the shape of the pulse profile and the
short and long-term evolution of the source light-curve can be explained by invoking a combination
of a "fan" and a "polar" beam. Our spectroscopic analysis, reveals a two-component emission: a hard
power law and a soft thermal component. We find that the latter produces the bulk of the non-pulsating
emission and is most likely the result of reprocessing of the primary hard emission, by optically
thick material that partially obscures the central source. We also detect strong emission lines
from highly ionized metals. The strength of the emission lines are strongly phase-depended. The
energy and temporal evolution and the shape of the pulse profile and the long-term spectra evolution
of the source are consistent with the expected emission pattern of the accretion column in the super-critical
regime, while the presence of a large reprocessing region is consistent with the analysis of previously
studied X-ray pulsars observed at high accretion rates. The presence of this region is consistent
with recently proposed works that suggest that high-B NSs occupy a considerable fraction of ULXs.
