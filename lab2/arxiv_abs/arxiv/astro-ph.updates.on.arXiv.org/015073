V341 Ara was recently recognised as one of the closest (d ~ 150 pc) and brightest (V~ 10) nova-like
cataclysmic variables. This unique system is surrounded by a bright emission nebula, likely to
be the remnant of a recent nova eruption. Embedded within this nebula is a prominent bow-shock, where
the system's accretion disc wind runs into its own nova shell. In order to establish its fundamental
properties, we present the first comprehensive multi-wavelength study of the system. Long-term
photometry reveals quasi-periodic, super-orbital variations with a characteristic time-scale
of 10-16 days and typical amplitude of ~1 mag. High-cadence photometry from TESS reveals for the
first time both the orbital period and a "negative superhump" period. The latter is usually interpreted
as the signature of a tilted accretion disc. We propose a recently developed disc instability model
as a plausible explanation for the photometric behaviour. In our spectroscopic data, we clearly
detect anti-phased absorption and emission line components. Their radial velocities suggest
a high mass ratio, which in turn implies an unusually low white dwarf mass. We also constrain the wind
mass-loss rate of the system from the spatially resolved [O iii] emission produced in the bow-shock;
this can be used to test and calibrate accretion disc wind models. We suggest a possible association
between V341 Ara and a "guest star" mentioned in Chinese historical records in AD1240. If this marks
the date of the system's nova eruption, V341 Ara would be the oldest recovered nova of its class and
an excellent laboratory for testing nova theory.
