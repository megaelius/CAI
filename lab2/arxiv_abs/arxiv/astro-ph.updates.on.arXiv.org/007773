The gamma-ray burst that followed the first detection of gravitational waves from the merger of
a Binary Neutron Stars and its low energy counterparts were in many respects unusual and challenge
our understanding of mechanisms involved in their production. In a previous work we used a phenomenological
formulation of relativistic shocks and synchrotron emission to analyse the prompt gamma-ray emission
of GW/GRB 170817A. Here we use the same model to analyse late afterglows of this event. The main goal
is to see whether synchrotron emission alone can explain late afterglows. We find that collision
between a mildly relativistic outflow from the merger with a Lorentz factor of $\sim 1.2-3$ and the
ISM/circumburst material can explain observations, if the synchrotron self-absorption of radio
emission and extinction of optical/IR photons are taken into account. Alternatively, an additional
source of X-ray is necessary to explain the data. These conclusions are independent of the model
used here and can be deduced directly from data. We also show that at the time of its encounter with
circumburst material the outflow could have been still mildly magnetized. The origin for optical
extinction could be a dust rich old faint star cluster surrounding the BNS, which had also helped
its formation and merger. Such environment evades present observational constraints and is consistent
with our conclusions about properties and evolution of the progenitor neutron stars obtained from
the prompt gamma-ray. If the synchrotron emission was produced by collision between density shells,
the extinction might have occurred inside the outflow itself rather than externally. A plausible
source of additional X-ray is decay of medium and heavy isotopes produced by the kilonova, including
r-processes, and recombination of cooled electrons. Contribution of these processes should be
quantified in future works.
