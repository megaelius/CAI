SWIFT J1658.2-4242 is an X-ray transient discovered recently in the Galactic plane, with severe
X-ray absorption corresponding to an equivalent hydrogen column density of $N_{\rm H,abs}\sim2\times10^{23}$
cm$^{-2}$. Using new Chandra and XMM-Newton data, we discover a strong X-ray dust scattering halo
around it. The halo profile can be well fitted by the scattering from at least three separated dust
layers. During the persistent emission phase of SWIFT J1658.2-4242, the best-fit dust scattering
$N_{\rm H,sca}$ based on the COMP-AC-S dust grain model is consistent with $N_{\rm H,abs}$. The
best-fit halo models show that 85-90 percent of the intervening gas and dust along the line of sight
of SWIFT J1658.2-4242 are located in the foreground ISM in the Galactic disk. The dust scattering
halo also shows significant azimuthal asymmetry, which appears consistent with the inhomogeneous
distribution of foreground molecular clouds. By matching the different dust layers to the distribution
of molecular clouds along the line of sight, we estimate the source distance to be $\sim$10 kpc, which
is also consistent with the results given by several other independent methods of distance estimation.
The dust scattering opacity and the existence of a halo can introduce a significant spectral bias,
the level of which depends on the shape of the instrumental point spread function and the source extraction
region. We create the Xspec dscor model to correct for this spectral bias for different X-ray instruments.
Our study reenforces the importance of considering the spectral effects of dust scattering in other
absorbed X-ray sources.
