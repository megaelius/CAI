Most galaxies with a well-structured bulge host a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in their centre.
Stellar kinematics models applied to adaptive optics (AO) assisted integral field unit observations
are well-suited to measure the SMBH mass ($M_{BH}$) and also the total mass-to-light ratio [$(M/L)_{TOT}$]
and possible anisotropies in the stellar velocity distribution in the central region of galaxies.
In this work, we used new AO assisted Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrometer (NIFS) observations
and also photometric data from the Hubble Space Telescope Legacy Archive of the galaxy NGC 4546 in
order to determine its SMBH mass. To do this, we applied the Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method
to fit the average second velocity moment in the line of sight $(\overline{v^2_{los}})$ of the stellar
structure. In addition, we also obtained $(M/L)_{TOT}$ and the classical anisotropy parameter
$\beta_z$=1--($\sigma_z$/$\sigma_R$)$^2$ for this object within a field of view of 200$\times$200
pc$^2$. Maps of the stellar radial velocity and of the velocity dispersion were built for this galaxy
using the penalized pixel fitting ({\sc ppxf}) technique. We applied the Multi Gaussian Expansion
procedure to fit the stellar brightness distribution. Using JAM, the best-fitting model for $\overline{v^2_{los}}$
of the stellar structure was obtained with $(M/L)_{TOT}$ = 4.34$\pm$0.07 (Johnson's R band), $M_{BH}$
= (2.56$\pm$0.16)$\times$10$^8$ M$_\odot$ and $\beta_z$ = --0.015$\pm$0.03 (3$\sigma$ confidence
level). With these results, we found that NGC 4546 follows the $M_{BH}$ $\times$ $\sigma$ relation.
We also measured the central velocity dispersion within a radius of 1 arcsec of this object as $\sigma_c$
= 241$\pm$2 km s$^{-1}$.
