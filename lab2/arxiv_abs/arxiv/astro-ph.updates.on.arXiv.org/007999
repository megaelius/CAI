Using the $\approx$15km ALMA long baselines, we imaged the Stokes $I$ emission and linearly polarized
intensity ($PI$) in the 1.1-mm continuum band of a very young intermediate-mass protostellar source,
MMS 6, in the Orion Molecular Cloud-3. The achieved angular resolution, $0''.02{\times}0''.03$
($\approx$10 AU), shows for the first time a wealth of data on the dust emission polarization in the
central 200 AU of a protostar. The $PI$ peak is offset to the south-west (SW) by $\approx$20 AU with
respect to the Stokes $I$ peak. Its polarization degree is 11 % with its $E$-vector orientation of
P.A.${\approx}135^{\circ}$. A partial ring-like structure with a radius of $\approx$80 AU is
detected in $PI$ but not in the Stokes $I$. NW (north-west) and SE (south-east) parts of the ring are
bright with a high polarization degree of $\gtrsim$10 %, and their $E$-vector orientations are
roughly orthogonal to those observed near the center. We also detected arm-like polarized structures,
extending to 1000 AU scale to the north, with the $E$-vectors aligned along the minor axis of the structures.
We explored possible origins of the polarized emission comparing with magnetohydrodynamical
(MHD) simulations of the toroidal wrapping of the magnetic field. The simulations are consistent
with the $PI$ emission in the ring-like and the extended arm-like structures observed with ALMA.
However, the current simulations do not completely reproduce observed polarization characteristics
in the central 50 AU. Although the self-scattering model can explain the polarization pattern and
positional offset between the Stokes $I$ and $PI$, this model is not able to reproduce the observed
high degree of polarization.
