A remarkable discovery of NASA's Kepler mission is the wide diversity in the average densities of
planets of similar mass. After gas disk dissipation, fully formed planets could interact with nearby
planetesimals from a remnant planetesimal disk. These interactions would often lead to planetesimal
accretion due to the relatively high ratio between the planet size and the hill radius for typical
planets. We present calculations using the open-source stellar evolution toolkit MESA (Modules
for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) modified to include the deposition of planetesimals
into the H/He envelopes of sub-Neptunes (~1-20 MEarth). We show that planetesimal accretion can
alter the mass-radius isochrones for these planets. The same initial planet as a result of the same
total accreted planetesimal mass can have up to ~5% difference in mean densities several Gyr after
the last accretion due to inherent stochasticity of the accretion process. During the phase of rapid
accretion these differences are more dramatic. The additional energy deposition from the accreted
planetesimals increase the ratio between the planet's radius to that of the core during rapid accretion,
which in turn leads to enhanced loss of atmospheric mass. As a result, the same initial planet can
end up with very different envelope mass fractions. These differences manifest as differences
in mean densities long after accretion stops. These effects are particularly important for planets
initially less massive than ~10 MEarth and with envelope mass fraction less than ~10%, thought to
be the most common type of planets discovered by Kepler.
