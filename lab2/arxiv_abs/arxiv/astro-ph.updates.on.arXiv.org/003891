Observations of luminous quasars have detected fast (~1000 km s$^{-1}$) outflows of molecular
gas. We recently used a series of hydro-chemical simulations to demonstrate that these molecular
outflows can be explained by the formation of molecules within the AGN wind material itself. However,
such simulations are computationally expensive, which limits the physical parameter space that
we can explore. We have therefore developed an analytic model to follow the radiative cooling of
the shocked ISM layer of a spherically symmetric AGN wind. We use this model to explore a wide range
of ambient densities ($1-10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$), density profile slopes ($0-1.5$), AGN luminosities
($10^{44}-10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$), and metallicities ($0.1-3$ Z$_{\odot}$). The analytic models
mostly cool within ~1 Myr, and are therefore likely to produce observable molecular outflows. The
momentum boost, calculated from the instantaneous rate of change of the outflow momentum, initially
increases as the outflow decelerates, as expected for an energy-conserving outflow. However,
it reaches a maximum of $\approx$20, due to the work done against the gravitational potential of
the black hole and host galaxy. A time-averaged observational estimate of the momentum boost, calculated
from the outflow velocity, radius and molecular mass, reaches a maximum of $\approx 1-2$. This is
partly due to our assumed molecular fraction, 0.2, but we also show that the instantaneous and observationally
time-averaged definitions are not equivalent. Thus recent observations that estimated momentum
boosts of order unity do not necessarily rule out an energy-driven outflow.
