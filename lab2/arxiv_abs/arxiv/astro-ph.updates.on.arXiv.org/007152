We present 0.3" (band 6) and 1.5" (band 3) ALMA observations of the (sub)millimeter dust continuum
emission for 25 radio galaxies at 1<z<5.2. Our survey reaches a rms flux density of ~50$\mu$Jy in
band 6 and ~20$\mu$Jy in band 3. This is an order of magnitude deeper than single-dish 850 $\mu$m observations,
and reaches fluxes where synchrotron and thermal dust emission are expected to be of the same order
of magnitude. Combining our sensitive ALMA observations with radio data from ATCA, VLA, and IR photometry
from Herschel and Spitzer, we have disentangled the synchrotron and thermal dust emission. We determine
the star-formation rates (SFR) and AGN IR luminosities using our newly developed spectral energy
distribution fitting code MrMoose. We find that synchrotron emission contributes substantially
at ~1 mm. Through our sensitive flux limits and accounting for a contribution from synchrotron emission
in the mm, we revise downward the median SFR by a factor of 7 compared to previous estimates based solely
on Herschel and Spitzer data. The hosts of these radio-loud AGN appear predominantly below the main
sequence of star-forming galaxies, indicating that the star formation in many of the host galaxies
has been quenched. Future growth of the host galaxies without substantial black hole mass growth
will be needed to bring these objects on the local relation between the supermassive black holes
and their host galaxies. Given the mismatch in the timescales of any star formation that took place
in the host galaxies and lifetime of the AGN, we hypothesize that a key role is played by star formation
in depleting the gas before the action of the powerful radio jets quickly drives out the remaining
gas. This positive feedback loop of efficient star formation rapidly consuming the gas coupled
to the action of the radio jets in removing the residual gas is how massive galaxies are rapidly quenched.
