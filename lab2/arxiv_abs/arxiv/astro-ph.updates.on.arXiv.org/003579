We discuss a new type of Higgs-portal dark matter (DM)-production mechanism, called bosonic-seesaw
portal (BSP) scenario. The BS provides the dynamical origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking,
triggered by mixing between the elementary Higgs and a composite Higgs generated by a new-color
strong dynamics, hypercolor (HC). At the HC strong coupling scale, the classical-scale invariance
assumed in the model is dynamically broken as well as the "chiral" symmetry present in the HC sector.
In addition to the composite Higgs, HC baryons emerge to potentially be stable because of the unbroken
HC baryon number symmetry. Hence the lightest HC baryon can be a DM candidate. Of interest in the present
scenario is that HC pions can be as heavy as the HC baryon due to the possibly enhanced-explicit "chiral"-breaking
effect triggered after the BS mechanism, so the HC baryon pair cannot annihilate into HC pions. As
in the standard setup of freeze-in scenario, it is assumed that the DM was never in the thermal equilibrium,
which ends up with no thermal abundance. It is then the non-thermal BSP process that crucially comes
into the game below the HC scale: the HC baryon significantly couples to the standard-model Higgs
via the BS mechanism, and can non-thermally be produced from the thermal plasma below the HC scale,
which turns out to allow the TeV mass scale for the composite baryonic DM, much smaller than the generic
bound placed in the conventional thermal freeze-out scenario, to account for the observed relic
abundance. Thus the DM can closely be related to the mechanism of the electroweak symmetry breaking.
