Classical abundance matching has been shown to produce mass estimates, $M^{\rm abund}_{200}$,
that agree well with independent dynamical estimates, $M^{\rm dyn}_{200}$, for isolated dwarfs.
However, for satellite galaxies, it is expected to fail. This is because tidal stripping lowers
$M_*$ and $M^{\rm dyn}_{200}$, causing satellites to scatter above the $M_*-M_{200}$ relation
for isolated dwarfs, while ram-pressure stripping quenches star formation on infall, causing
satellites to scatter below the relation. In this paper, we introduce a novel abundance matching
technique that produces a more accurate estimate of $M_{200}$ for satellite galaxies. To achieve
this, we abundance match with the mean star formation rate, averaged over the time when a galaxy was
forming stars, $\langle {\rm SFR}\rangle$, instead of $M_*$. Using data from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey and the Bolshoi simulation, we obtain a statistical $\langle {\rm SFR}\rangle-{\rm
M}_{200}$ relation in $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$. We then compare $M^{\rm abund}_{200}$ derived from
this relation with $M^{\rm dyn}_{200}$ for 21 nearby dSph and dIrr galaxies, finding a good agreement
between the two. As a first application, we use our new $\langle {\rm SFR}\rangle-{\rm M}_{200}$
relation to empirically measure the cumulative mass function of a volume-complete sample of bright
Milky Way satellites within 280 kpc of the Galactic centre. We compare this with a suite of cosmological
'zoom' simulations of Milky Way-mass halos that account for subhalo depletion by the Milky Way disc.
Including a conservative lower bound on the number of 'ultra-faint' dwarfs in this same volume,
we find no missing satellites problem above $M_{200} \sim 10^9$M$_\odot$ in the Milky Way. We discuss
how this empirical method can be applied to a larger sample of spiral galaxies in the Local Volume.
