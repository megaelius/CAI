We present a Census of the Local Universe (CLU) -- a combination of the largest area H$\alpha$ survey
for nearby emission-line galaxies to date as well as a compilation of all publicly available galaxy
catalogs out to a distance of 200 Mpc. With the Palomar 48-inch telescope, our H$\alpha$ survey images
$\approx$3$\pi$ of the sky (3626 pointings) in 4 narrowband filters to an H$\alpha$ flux limit of
$10^{-14}$ erg/s/cm$^2$ at 90% completeness. To characterize the completeness and contamination
of the H$\alpha$ survey, we undertook a study of 14 preliminary fields (0.3% of total pointings)
where we have obtained spectroscopic follow-up of all galaxy candidates with no previous distance
information and a narrow-band color excess greater than 2.5$\sigma$. Comparison of the resulting
CLU-H$\alpha$ galaxy catalog to a statistically complete sample of star-forming galaxies in a
11 Mpc volume (the LVL sample), we find that the H$\alpha$ survey would be complete to 85% in star-formation
(using H$\alpha$ flux corrected for extinction as a proxy) and 70% in stellar mass at 200 Mpc. The
contamination from high-redshift galaxies is lower than 8% (40%) for a 5$\sigma$ (2.5$\sigma$)
color excess. Even with just 290 emission-line galaxies in the 14 preliminary fields, we find several
interesting objects: 7 newly discovered blue compact dwarfs (aka, blueberries), 1 new green pea,
1 new QSO, and a known planetary nebula. The extreme galaxies (green pea and blueberries) have high
star formation rates, low stellar masses, and low metallicities and could be local analogs to higher
redshift primordial galaxies. The existence of these objects in our preliminary H$\alpha$ sample
exemplifies that the full CLU-H$\alpha$ survey can be used as a discovery machine for a wide variety
of objects in our own Galaxy and extreme galaxies out to intermediate redshifts.
