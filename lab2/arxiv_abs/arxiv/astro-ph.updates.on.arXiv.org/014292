Large scale spectral maps of star forming regions enable the comparative study of the gas excitation
around an ensemble of sources at a common frame of reference, providing direct insights in the multitude
of processes involved. In this paper we employ spectral-line maps to decipher the excitation, the
kinematical and dynamical processes in NGC 1333 as revealed by a number of different emission lines,
aiming to set a reference for the applicability of tracers in constraining diverse physical processes.
We reconstruct line maps for H$_2$ , CO, H$_2$O and C$^+$ using data obtained with the Spitzer-IRS
and Herschel HIFI-SPIRE. We compare the morphological features of the maps and derive the gas excitation
for regions of interest employing LTE and non-LTE methods. We also calculate the kinematical and
dynamical properties for each outflow tracer consistently for all outflows in NGC 1333. We finally
measure the water abundance in outflows with respect to carbon monoxide and molecular hydrogen.
CO and H$_2$ are highly excited around B-stars and at lower levels trace protostellar outflows.
H$_2$O emission is dominated by a moderately fast component associated with outflows. Intermediate
J CO lines appear brightest at the locations traced by a narrow H$_2$O component, indicating that
beyond the dominating collisional processes, a secondary, radiative excitation component can
also be active. The morphology, kinematics, excitation and abundance variations of water are consistent
with its excitation and partial dissociation in shocks. Water abundance ranges between 5 x 10$^{-7}$
and 10$^{-5}$, with the lower values being more representative. Water is brightest and most abundant
around IRAS 4A which is consistent with the latter hosting a hot corino source. Finally, the outflow
mass flux is found highest for CO and decreases by one and two orders of magnitude for H$_2$ and H$_2$O,
respectively.
