I discuss the possibility that accreting, supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries with sub-parsec
separations produce luminous, periodically recurring outbursts that interrupt periods of relative
quiescence. This hypothesis is motivated by two characteristics found in simulations of binaries
embedded in prograde accretion discs: (i) the formation of a central, low-density cavity, and (ii)
the leakage of circumbinary gas into this cavity, occurring once per orbit, via discrete streams
on nearly radial trajectories. The first feature will diminish the emergent optical/UV flux of
the system relative to active galactic nuclei (AGN) powered by single SMBHs, while the second is
likely to trigger periodic fluctuations in the emergent flux. I propose a simple toy model in which
a leaked stream crosses its own orbit and shocks, converting its bulk kinetic energy to heat. The
result is a hot, optically thick flow that is quickly accreted and produces a flare with an AGN-like
spectrum that peaks in the UV and ranges from the optical to the soft X-ray. Due to the preceding quiescence,
such a flare could plausibly be mistaken for the tidal disruption of a star. For typical binary periods
of years to decades, the event rate in an individual system can be much higher than that predicted
for stellar tidal disruptions but infrequent enough to hinder tests of periodicity. The flares
proposed here can be produced by very massive (>10^8 Msol) SMBHs that would not tidally disrupt
solar-type stars. They could be discovered serendipitously in the future by observatories such
as LSST or eROSITA. I apply the model to the active galaxy OJ 287, whose production of periodic optical
flares has long fueled speculation that it hosts a SMBH binary.
