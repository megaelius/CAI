We present Herschel PACS and SPIRE spectroscopy of the most important far-infrared cooling lines
in the nearby edge-on spiral galaxy, NGC 891: [CII] 158 $\mu$m, [NII] 122, 205 $\mu$m, [OI] 63, 145
$\mu$m, and [OIII] 88 $\mu$m. We find that the photoelectric heating efficiency of the gas, traced
via the ([CII]+[OII]63)/$F_{\mathrm{TIR}}$ ratio, varies from a mean of 3.5$\times$10$^{-3}$
in the centre up to 8$\times$10$^{-3}$ at increasing radial and vertical distances in the disc.
A decrease in ([CII]+[OII]63)/$F_{\mathrm{TIR}}$ but constant ([CII]+[OI]63)/$F_{\mathrm{PAH}}$
with increasing FIR colour suggests that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may become important
for gas heating in the central regions. We compare the observed flux of the FIR cooling lines and total
IR emission with the predicted flux from a PDR model to determine the gas density, surface temperature
and the strength of the incident far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field, $G_{0}$. Resolving details
on physical scales of ~0.6 kpc, a pixel-by-pixel analysis reveals that the majority of the PDRs in
NGC 891's disc have hydrogen densities of 1 < log ($n$/cm$^{-3}$) < 3.5 experiencing an incident
FUV radiation field with strengths of 1.7 < log $G_0$ < 3. Although these values we derive for
most of the disc are consistent with the gas properties found in PDRs in the spiral arms and inter-arm
regions of M51, observed radial trends in $n$ and $G_0$ are shown to be sensitive to varying optical
thickness in the lines, demonstrating the importance of accurately accounting for optical depth
effects when interpreting observations of high inclination systems. With an empirical relationship
between the MIPS 24 $\mu$m and [NII] 205 $\mu$m emission, we estimate an enhancement of the FUV radiation
field strength in the far north-eastern side of the disc.
