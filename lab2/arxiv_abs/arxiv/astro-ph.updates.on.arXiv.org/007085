We have analyzed the complete Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) data archive of Titan.
Our objective is to build global surface cartographic products, by combining all the data gathered
during the 127 targeted flybys of Titan into synthetic global maps interpolated on a grid at 32 pixels
per degree (~1.4 km/pixel at the equator), in seven infrared spectral atmospheric windows. Multispectral
summary images have been computed for each single VIMS cube in order to rapidly identify their scientific
content and assess their quality. These summary images are made available to the community on a public
website (vims.univ-nantes.fr). The global mapping work faced several challenges due to the strong
absorbing and scattering effects of the atmosphere coupled to the changing observing conditions
linked to the orbital tour of the Cassini mission. We determined a surface photometric function
which accounts for variations in incidence, emergence and phase angles, and which is able to mitigate
brightness variations linked to the viewing geometry of the flybys. The atmospheric contribution
has been reduced using the subtraction of the methane absorption band wings, considered as proxies
for atmospheric haze scattering. We present a new global three color composite map of band ratios
(red: 1.59/1.27 {\mu}m; green: 2.03/1.27 {\mu}m; blue: 1.27/1.08 {\mu}m), which has also been
empirically corrected from an airmass (the solar photon path length through the atmosphere) dependence.
This map provides a detailed global color view of Titan's surface partially corrected from the atmosphere
and gives a global insight of the spectral variability, with the equatorial dunes fields appearing
in brownish tones, and several occurrences of bluish tones localized in areas such as Sinlap, Menvra
and Selk craters. (...)
