NanoSIMS C-, N-, and O-isotopic mapping of matrix in CO3.0 chondrite Dominion Range (DOM) 08006
revealed it to have in its matrix the highest abundance of presolar O-rich grains (257 +76 / -96 ppm,
2$\sigma$) of any meteorite. It also has a matrix abundance of presolar SiC of 35 (+25 / -17, 2$\sigma$)
ppm, similar to that seen across primitive chondrite classes. This provides additional support
to bulk isotopic and petrologic evidence that DOM 08006 is the most primitive known CO meteorite.
Transmission electron microscopy of five presolar silicate grains revealed one to have a composite
mineralogy similar to larger amoeboid olivine aggregates and consistent with equilibrium condensation,
two non-stoichiometric amorphous grains and two olivine grains, though one is identified as such
solely based on its composition. We also found insoluble organic matter (IOM) to be present primarily
as sub-micron inclusions with ranges of C- and N-isotopic anomalies similar to those seen in primitive
CR chondrites and interplanetary dust particles. In contrast to other primitive extraterrestrial
materials, H isotopic imaging showed normal and homogeneous D/H. Most likely, DOM 08006 and other
CO chondrites accreted a similar complement of primitive and isotopically anomalous organic matter
to that found in other chondrite classes and IDPs, but the very limited amount of thermal metamorphism
experienced by DOM 08006 has caused loss of D-rich organic moieties, while not substantially affecting
either the molecular carriers of C and N anomalies or most inorganic phases in the meteorite. One
C-rich grain that was highly depleted in $^{13}$C and $^{15}$N was identified; we propose it originated
in the Sun's parental molecular cloud.
