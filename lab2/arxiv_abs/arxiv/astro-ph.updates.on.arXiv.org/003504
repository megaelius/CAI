The so-called H$\alpha$ third emission occurs around pulsation phase $\varphi$=0.30. It has been
observed for the first time in 2011 in some RR Lyrae stars. The emission intensity is very weak, and
its profile is a tiny persistent hump in the red side-line profile. We report the first observation
of the H$\alpha$ third emission in RR Lyr itself (HD 182989), the brightest RR Lyrae star in the sky.
New spectra were collected in 2013-2014 with the Aurelie}spectrograph (resolving power R=22$\,$700,
T152, Observatoire de Haute-Provence, France) and in 2016-2017 with the eShel spectrograph (R=11$\,$000,
T035, Observatoire de Chelles, France). In addition, observations obtained in 1997 with the Elodie
spectrograph (R=42$\,$000, T193, Observatoire de Haute-Provence, France) were reanalyzed.
The H$\alpha$ third emission is clearly detected in the pulsation phase interval $\varphi$=0.188-0.407,
that is, during about 20% of the period. Its maximum flux with respect to the continuum is about 13%.
The presence of this third emission and its strength both seem to depend only marginally on the Blazhko
phase. The physical origin of the emission is probably due to the infalling motion of the highest
atmospheric layers, which compresses and heats the gas that is located immediately above the rising
shock wave. The infalling velocity of the hot compressed region is supersonic, almost 50 km$\cdot$s$^{-1}$,
while the shock velocity may be much lower in these pulsation phases. When the H$\alpha$ third emission
appears, the shock is certainly no longer radiative because its intensity is not sufficient to produce
a blueshifted emission component within the H$\alpha$ profile. At phase $\varphi$=0.40, the shock
wave is certainly close to its complete dissipation in the atmosphere.
