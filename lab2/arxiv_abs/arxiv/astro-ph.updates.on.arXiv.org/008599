We explore scenarios for reionizing the intergalactic medium with low galaxy ionizing photon escape
fractions. We combine simulation-based halo-mass dependent escape fractions with an extrapolation
of the observed galaxy rest-ultraviolet luminosity functions to solve for the reionization history
from z=20 to z=4. We explore the posterior distributions for key unknown quantities, including
the limiting halo mass for star-formation, the ionizing photon production efficiency, and a potential
contribution from active galactic nuclei (AGN). We marginalize over the allowable parameter space
using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, finding a solution which satisfies the most model-independent
constraints on reionization. Our fiducial model can match observational constraints with an average
escape fraction of <5% throughout the bulk of the epoch of reionization if: i) galaxies form stars
down to the atomic cooling limit before reionization and a photosuppression mass of log(M_h/Msol)~9
during/after reionization (-13<M_UV,lim<-11); ii) galaxies become more efficient producers
of ionizing photons at higher redshifts and fainter magnitudes, and iii) there is a significant,
but sub-dominant, contribution by AGN at z < 7. In this model the faintest galaxies (M_UV>-15) dominate
the ionizing emissivity, leading to an earlier start to reionization and a smoother evolution of
the ionized volume filling fraction than models which assume a single escape fraction at all redshifts
and luminosities. The ionizing emissivity from this model is consistent with observations at z=4-5
(and below, when extrapolated), in contrast to some models which assume a single escape fraction.
Our predicted ionized volume filling fraction at z=7 of Q_HII=78% (+\- 8%) is in ~1-2 sigma tension
with observations of Lya emitters at z~7 and the damping wing analyses of the two known z>7 quasars,
which prefer Q_HII,z=7~40-50%.
