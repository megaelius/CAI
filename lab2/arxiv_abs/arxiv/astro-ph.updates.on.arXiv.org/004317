Quasars are among the most luminous sources characterized by their broad band spectra ranging from
radio through optical to X-ray band, with numerous emission and absorption features. Using the
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Boroson & Green (1992) were able to show significant correlations
between the measured parameters. Among the significant correlations projected, the leading component,
related to Eigenvector 1 (EV1) was dominated by the anti-correlation between the Fe${\mathrm{II}}$
optical emission and [OIII] line where the EV1 alone contained 30% of the total variance. This introduced
a way to define a quasar main sequence, in close analogy to the stellar main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russel
(HR) diagram (Sulentic et. al 2001). Which of the basic theoretically motivated parameters of an
active nucleus (Eddington ratio, black hole mass, accretion rate, spin, and viewing angle) is the
main driver behind the EV1 yet remains to be answered. We currently limit ourselves to the optical
waveband, and concentrate on theoretical modelling the Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ to H$\mathrm{\beta}$
ratio, and test the hypothesis that the physical driver of EV1 is the maximum of the accretion disk
temperature, reflected in the shape of the spectral energy distribution (SED). We performed computations
of the H$\mathrm{\beta}$ and optical Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ for a broad range of SED peak position using
CLOUDY photoionisation code. We assumed that both H$\mathrm{\beta}$ and Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ emission
come from the Broad Line Region represented as a constant density cloud in a plane-parallel geometry.
We compare the results for two different approaches: (1) considering a fixed bolometric luminosity
for the SED; (2) considering $\mathrm{L_{bol}/L_{Edd}}$ = 1.
