We present the first observations of foreground Lyman-$\alpha$ forest absorption from high-redshift
galaxies, targeting 24 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) with $z\sim 2.3-2.8$ within a $5' \times 15'$
region of the COSMOS field. The transverse sightline separation is $\sim 2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$
comoving, allowing us to create a tomographic reconstruction of the 3D Ly$\alpha$ forest absorption
field over the redshift range $2.20\leq z\leq 2.45$. The resulting map covers $6\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}
\times 14\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ in the transverse plane and $230\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ along
the line-of-sight with a spatial resolution of $\approx 3.5\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$, and is the
first high-fidelity map of large-scale structure on $\sim\mathrm{Mpc}$ scales at $z>2$. Our
map reveals significant structures with $\gtrsim 10\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ extent, including
several spanning the entire transverse breadth, providing qualitative evidence for the filamentary
structures predicted to exist in the high-redshift cosmic web. Simulated reconstructions with
the same sightline sampling, spectral resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio recover the salient
structures present in the underlying 3D absorption fields. Using data from other surveys, we identified
18 galaxies with known redshifts coeval with our map volume enabling a direct comparison to our tomographic
map. This shows that galaxies preferentially occupy high-density regions, in qualitative agreement
with the same comparison applied to simulations. Our results establishes the feasibility of the
CLAMATO survey, which aims to obtain Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra for $\sim 1000$ SFGs over $\sim 1
\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ of the COSMOS field, in order to map out IGM large-scale structure at $\langle
z \rangle \sim 2.3$ over a large volume $(100\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc})^3$.
