We describe a new neural-net based light curve classifier and provide it with documentation as a
ready-to-use tool for the community. While optimized for identification and classification of
eclipsing binary stars, the classifier is general purpose, and has been developed for speed in the
context of upcoming massive surveys such as LSST. A challenge for classifiers in the context of neural-net
training and massive data sets is to minimize the number of parameters required to describe each
light curve. We show that a simple and fast geometric representation that encodes the overall light
curve shape, together with a chi-square parameter to capture higher-order morphology information
results in efficient yet robust light curve classification, especially for eclipsing binaries.
Testing the classifier on the ASAS light curve database, we achieve a retrieval rate of 98\% and a
false-positive rate of 2\% for eclipsing binaries. We achieve similarly high retrieval rates for
most other periodic variable-star classes, including RR Lyrae, Mira, and delta Scuti. However,
the classifier currently has difficulty discriminating between different sub-classes of eclipsing
binaries, and suffers a relatively low ($\sim$60\%) retrieval rate for multi-mode delta Cepheid
stars. We find that it is imperative to train the classifier's neural network with exemplars that
include the full range of light curve quality to which the classifier will be expected to perform;
the classifier performs well on noisy light curves only when trained with noisy exemplars. The classifier
source code, ancillary programs, a trained neural net, and a guide for use, are provided.
