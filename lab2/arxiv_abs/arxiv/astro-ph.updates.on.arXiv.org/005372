The population of fast radio bursts (FRBs) will continue to diverge into two groups depending on
their method of discovery: those which can be localised, and those which cannot. Events potentially
less useful for astronomical and cosmological purposes due to limited localisation will accumulate
with the advent of new facilities and continued efforts by, e.g., the SUPERB collaboration, which
may require afterglows or multi-wavelength counterparts for sub-arcsecond localisation. It
is important to exploit these sources to their maximum scientific potential. We perform analysis
of FRB dispersion measures (DMs), considering different theoretical FRB progenitors with view
to place more rigorous constraints on FRB redshifts, in particular for large statistical samples,
via their DMs. We review FRB DM components, and build redshift-scalable probability distributions
corresponding to different progenitor scenarios. We combine these components into a framework
for obtaining FRB DM probabilities given their redshifts. Taking into account different possibilities
for the evolution of progenitors across cosmic time we invert this model, thus deriving redshift
constraints. Effects of varying FRB progenitor models are illustrated. While, as expected, host
galaxy DM contributions become decreasingly important with increasing redshift, for AGN-like
progenitor scenarios they could remain significant out to redshift 3. Constraints are placed on
redshifts of catalogued FRBs with various models and increasingly realistic models may be employed
as general understanding of FRBs improves. For localised FRBs, we highlight future prospects for
disentangling host and intergalactic medium DM components using their respective redshift scaling.
We identify a use for large samples of unlocalised FRBs resulting from upcoming flux-limited surveys,
such as with CHIME, in mapping out the Milky Way contribution to the DM.
