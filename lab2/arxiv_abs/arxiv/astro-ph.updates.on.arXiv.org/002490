We examine variations of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in extreme environments within
the formalism derived by Hennebelle \& Chabrier. We focus on conditions encountered in progenitors
of massive early type galaxies and starburst regions. We show that, when applying the concept of
turbulent Jeans mass as the characteristic mass for fragmentation in a turbulent medium, instead
of the standard thermal Jeans mass for purely gravitational fragmentation, the peak of the IMF in
such environments is shifted towards smaller masses, leading to a bottom-heavy IMF, as suggested
by various observations. In very dense and turbulent environments, we predict that the high-mass
tail of the IMF can become even steeper than the standard Salpeter IMF, with a limit for the power law
exponent $\alpha\simeq -2.7$, in agreement with recent observational determinations. This steepening
is a direct consequence of the high densities and Mach values in such regions but also of the time dependence
of the fragmentation process, as incorporated in the Hennebelle-Chabrier theory. We provide analytical
parametrizations of these IMFs in such environments, to be used in galaxy evolution calculations.
We also calculate the star formation rates and the mass-to-light ratios expected under such extreme
conditions and show that they agree well with the values inferred in starburst environments and
massive high-redshift galaxies. This reinforces the paradigm of star formation as being a universal
process, i.e. the direct outcome of gravitationally unstable fluctuations in a density field initially
generated by large scale shock-dominated turbulence. This globally enables us to infer the variations
of the stellar IMF and related properties for atypical galactic conditions.
