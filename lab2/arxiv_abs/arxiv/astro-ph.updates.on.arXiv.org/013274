We report, for the first time, the detection of the Mn-K$\alpha$ line in the Type IIb supernova (SN
IIb) remnant, Cassiopeia A. Manganese ($^{55}$Mn after decay of $^{55}$Co), a neutron-rich element,
together with chromium ($^{52}$Cr after decay of $^{52}$Fe), is mainly synthesized at the explosive
incomplete Si burning regime. Therefore, the Mn/Cr mass ratio with its neutron excess reflects
the neutronization at the relevant burning layer during the explosion. Chandra's archival X-ray
data of Cassiopeia A indicate a low Mn/Cr mass ratio with values in the range 0.10--0.66, which, when
compared to one-dimensional SN explosion models, requires that the electron fraction be 0.4990
$\lesssim Y_{\rm e} \lesssim$ 0.5 at the incomplete Si burning layer. An explosion model assuming
a solar-metallicity progenitor with a typical explosion energy ($1 \times 10^{51}$ erg) fails
to reproduce such a high electron fraction. In such models, the explosive Si-burning regime extends
only to the Si/O layer established during the progenitor's hydrostatic evolution; the $Y_e$ in
the Si/O layer is lower than the value required by our observational constraints. We can satisfy
the observed Mn/Cr mass ratio if the explosive Si-burning regime were to extend into the O/Ne hydrostatic
layer, which has a higher $Y_{\rm e}$. This would require an energetic ($> 2 \times 10^{51}$ erg)
and/or asymmetric explosion of a sub-solar metallicity progenitor ($Z \lesssim 0.5Z_{\odot}$)
for Cassiopeia A. The low initial metallicity can be used to rule out a single-star progenitor, leaving
the possibility of a binary progenitor with a compact companion (white dwarf, neutron star or black
hole). We discuss the detectability of X-rays from Bondi accretion onto such a compact companion
around the explosion site. We also discuss other possible mass-loss scenarios for the progenitor
system of Cassiopeia A.
