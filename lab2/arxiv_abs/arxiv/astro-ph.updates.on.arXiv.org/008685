We investigate the connection between the morphology and internal kinematics of the stellar component
of central galaxies with mass $M_\star > {10}^{9.5} {\rm M}_\odot$ in the EAGLE simulations. We
compare several kinematic diagnostics commonly used to describe simulated galaxies, and find
good consistency between them. We model the structure of galaxies as ellipsoids and quantify their
morphology via the ratios of their principal axes. We show that the differentiation of blue star-forming
and red quiescent galaxies using morphological diagnostics can be achieved with similar efficacy
to the use of kinematical diagnostics, but only if one is able to measure both the flattening and the
triaxiality of the galaxy. Flattened oblate galaxies exhibit greater rotational support than
their spheroidal counterparts, but there is significant scatter in the relationship between morphological
and kinematical diagnostics, such that kinematically-similar galaxies can exhibit a broad range
of morphologies. The scatter in the relationship between the flattening and the ratio of the rotation
and dispersion velocities ($v/\sigma$) correlates strongly with the anisotropy of the stellar
velocity dispersion: at fixed $v/\sigma$, flatter galaxies exhibit greater dispersion in the
plane defined by the intermediate and major axes than along the minor axis, indicating that the morphology
of simulated galaxies is influenced significantly by the structure of their velocity dispersion.
The simulations reveal that this anisotropy correlates with the intrinsic morphology of the galaxy's
inner dark matter halo, i.e. the halo's morphology that emerges in the absence of dissipative baryonic
physics. This implies the existence of a causal relationship between the morphologies of galaxies
and that of their host dark matter haloes.
