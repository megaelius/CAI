We present new observations of the XZ Tau system made at high angular resolution (55 milliarcsec)
with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at a wavelength of 7 mm. Observations of XZ Tau made with
the VLA in 2004 appeared to show a triple system, with XZ Tau A resolved into two sources, XZ Tau A and
XZ Tau C. The angular separation of XZ Tau A and C (0.09 arcsec) suggested a projected orbital separation
of around 13 AU with a possible orbital period of around 40 yr. Our observations were obtained approximately
8 yr later, a fifth of this putative orbital period, and should therefore allow us to constrain the
orbit of XZ Tau C, and evaluate the possibility that a recent periastron passage of C coincided with
the launch of extended optical outflows from XZ Tau A. Despite improved sensitivity and resolution
compared with previous observations, we find no evidence of XZ Tau C in our data. Components A and
B are detected with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than ten; their orbits are consistent with previous
studies, although the emission from XZ Tau A appears to be weaker. Three possible interpretations
are offered: either XZ Tau C is transiting XZ Tau A, which is broadly consistent with the periastron
passage hypothesis, or the emission seen in 2004 was that of a transient, or XZ Tau C does not exist.
A fourth interpretation, that XZ Tau C was ejected from the system, is dismissed due to the lack of
angular momentum redistribution in the orbits of XZ Tau A and XZ Tau B that would result from such an
event. Our observations are insufficient to distinguish between the remaining possibilities,
at least not until we obtain further VLA observations at a sufficiently later time. A further non-detection
would allow us to reject the transit hypothesis, and the periastron passage of XZ Tau C as agent of
XZ Tau A's outflows.
