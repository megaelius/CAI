We present population-orbit superposition models for external galaxies based on Schwarzschild's
orbit-superposition method, by tagging the orbits with age and metallicity. The models fit the
density distributions, as well as kinematic, age and metallicity maps from Integral Field Unit
(IFU) spectroscopy observations. We validate the method and demonstrate its power by applying
it to mock data, similar to those obtained by the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) IFU on
the Very Large Telescope (VLT). These mock data are created from Auriga galaxy simulations, viewed
at three different inclination angles ($\vartheta=40^o, 60^o, 80^o$). Constrained by MUSE-like
mock data, our model can recover the galaxy's stellar orbit distribution projected in orbital circularity
$\lambda_z$ vs. radius $r$, the intrinsic stellar population distribution in age $t$ vs. metallicity
$Z$, and the correlation between orbits' circularity $\lambda_z$ and stellar age $t$. A physically
motivated age-metallicity relation improves recovering the intrinsic stellar population distributions.
We decompose galaxies into cold, warm and hot + counter-rotating components based on their orbit
circularity distribution, and find that the surface density, mean velocity, velocity dispersion,
age and metallicity maps of each component from our models well reproduce those from simulation,
especially for projections close to edge-on. These galaxies exhibit strong global age vs. $\sigma_z$
relation, which is well recovered by our model. The method has the power to reveal the detailed build-up
of stellar structures in galaxies, and offers a complement to local resolved, and high-redshift
studies of galaxy evolution.
