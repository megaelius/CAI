The Sun is embedded in the so-called Local Bubble (LB) -- a cavity of hot plasma created by supernova
explosions and surrounded by a shell of cold, dusty gas. Knowing the local distortion of the Galactic
magnetic field associated with the LB is critical for the modeling of interstellar polarization
data at high Galactic latitudes. In this his paper, we relate the structure of the Galactic magnetic
field on the LB scale to three-dimensional (3D) maps of the local interstellar medium (ISM). First,
we extracted the geometry of the LB shell, its inner surface, in particular from 3D dust extinction
maps of the local ISM. We expanded the shell inner surface in spherical harmonics, up to a variable
maximum multipole degree, which enabled us to control the level of complexity for the modeled surface.
Next, we applied an analytical model for the ordered magnetic field in the shell to the modeled shell
surface. This magnetic field model was successfully fitted to the \textit{Planck} 353~GHz dust
polarized emission maps over the Galactic polar caps. For each polar cap, the direction of the mean
magnetic field derived from dust polarization (together with the prior that the field points toward
longitude $90^\circ \pm 90^\circ$) is found to be consistent with the Faraday spectra of the nearby
diffuse synchrotron emission. Our work presents a new approach to modeling the local structure
of the Galactic magnetic field. We expect our methodology and our results to be useful both in modeling
the local ISM as traced by its different components and in modeling the dust polarized emission,
which is a long-awaited input for studies of the polarized foregrounds for cosmic microwave background.
