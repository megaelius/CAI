Black widows are close binary systems in which a millisecond pulsar is orbited by a companion a few
per cent the mass of the sun. It has been suggested that the pulsar's rotationally powered $\gamma$-ray
luminosity gradually evaporates the companion, eventually leaving behind an isolated millisecond
pulsar. The evaporation efficiency is determined by the temperature $T_{\rm ch}\propto F^{2/3}$
to which the outflow is heated by the flux $F$ on a dynamical time-scale. Evaporation is most efficient
for companions that fill their Roche lobes. In this case, the outflow is dominated by a cap around
the L1 point with an angle $\theta_g\sim (T_{\rm ch}/T_g)^{1/2}$, and the evaporation time is $t_{\rm
evap}=0.46(T_{\rm ch}/T_g)^{-2}\textrm{ Gyr}$, where $T_g>T_{\rm ch}$ is the companion's virial
temperature. We apply our model to the observed black widow population, which has increased substantially
over the last decade, considering each system's orbital period, companion mass, and pulsar spin-down
power. While the original (Fruchter et al. 1988) black widow evaporates its companion on a few Gyr
time-scale, direct evaporation on its own is too weak to explain the overall population. We propose
instead that the evaporative wind couples to the companion's magnetic field, removes angular momentum
from the binary, and maintains stable Roche-lobe overflow. While a stronger wind carries more mass,
it also reduces the Alfv\'en radius, making this indirect magnetic braking mechanism less dependent
on the flux $t_{\rm mag}\propto t_{\rm evap}^{1/3}$. This reduces the scatter in evolution times
of observed systems, thus better explaining the combined black widow and isolated millisecond
pulsar populations.
