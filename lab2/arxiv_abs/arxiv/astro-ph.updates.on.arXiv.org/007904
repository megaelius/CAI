We investigate the connection between the HI~content, SFR and environment of galaxies using a hydrodynamic
simulation that incorporates scaling relations for galactic wind and a heuristic halo mass-based
quenching prescription. We run two zoom-in simulations of galaxy groups with $M_{halo}>10^{13}M_\odot$
at z=0, selected to have quiet merger histories. We track galaxies as they become satellites, and
compute the delay time $\tau_{d}$ during which the satellites are similar to central galaxies at
a given stellar mass, and a fading time $\tau_{f}$ during which satellites go from gas-rich and star-forming
to gas-poor and quiescent. We find $0.7< \tau_{d}< 3$ Gyr at $z=0$, and depends inversely on the satellite
halo mass at infall. At z ~ 1 we find ~$0.3< \tau_{d} < 2$ Gyr, broadly consistent with a positive correlation
with the Hubble time. For a given halo mass, lower stellar mass galaxies at infall time have higher
$\tau_{d}$. We generally find $\tau_{f}\ll \tau_{d}$, ranging between ~ 150 Myr at z~0 and ~ 80 Myr
at z ~ 1 based on linear interpolation, with some uncertainty because they are smaller than our simulation
output frequency ($200-300$ Myr). $\tau_{f}$ has no obvious dependency on infall halo mass. Both
timescales show little difference between HI depletion and SF quenching, indicating that using
up the gas reservoir by star formation without refilling is the main mechanism to transform satellite
galaxies at these halo masses. At a given physical distance from the center of the main halo of interest,
higher redshift galaxies have on average higher cold gas content, but the ratio of gas (HI or H$_2$)
to star formation rate is similar, indicating that star formation is consistently fed through reservoirs
of HI then H$_2$. For a given amount of HI, galaxies have shorter consumption times in more massive
halo structures.
