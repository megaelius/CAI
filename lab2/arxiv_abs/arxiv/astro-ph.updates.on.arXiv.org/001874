There are many ways to solve the challenging problem of making a high performance robotic observatory
from scratch. The Observatorio Astrof\'isico de Javalambre (OAJ) is a new astronomical facility
located at the Sierra de Javalambre (Teruel, Spain) whose primary role will be to conduct all-sky
astronomical surveys. The OAJ control system has been designed under a global point of view including
not only astronomical subsystems but also infrastructure and other facilities. Three main factors
have been considered in the design of a global control system for the robotic OAJ: quality, reliability
and efficiency. We propose CIA (Control Integrated Architecture) design and OEE (Overall Equipment
Effectiveness) as a key performance indicator in order to improve operation processes, minimizing
resources and obtain high cost reduction maintaining quality requirements. The OAJ subsystems
considered for the control integrated architecture are the following: two wide-field telescopes
and their instrumentation, active optics subsystems, facilities for sky quality monitoring (seeing,
extinction, sky background, sky brightness, clouds distribution, meteorological station),
domes and several infrastructure facilities such as water supply, glycol water, water treatment
plant, air conditioning, compressed air, LN2 plant, illumination, surveillance, access control,
fire suppression, electrical generators, electrical distribution, electrical consumption,
communication network, Uninterruptible Power Supply and two main control rooms, one at the OAJ
and other remotely located in Teruel at 40km from the observatory, connected through a microwave
radio-link. Here we present the OAJ strategy in control design to achieve maximum quality efficiency
for the observatory processes and operations, giving practical examples of our approach.
