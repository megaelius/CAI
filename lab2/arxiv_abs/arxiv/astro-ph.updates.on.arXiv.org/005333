AX J1745.6-2901 is an eclipsing low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) in the Galactic Centre (GC). It shows
significant X-ray excess emission during the eclipse phase, and its eclipse light curve shows an
asymmetric shape. We use archival XMM-Newton and Chandra observations to study the origin of these
peculiar X-ray eclipsing phenomena. We find that the shape of the observed X-ray eclipse light curves
depends on both photon energy and the shape of the source extraction region, and also shows differences
between the two instruments. By performing detailed simulations for the time-dependent X-ray
dust scattering halo, as well as directly modelling the observed eclipse and non-eclipse halo profiles
of AX J1745.6-2901, we obtained solid evidence that its peculiar eclipse phenomena are indeed caused
by the X-ray dust scattering in multiple foreground dust layers along the line-of-sight (LOS).
The apparent dependence on the instruments is caused by different instrumental point-spread-functions.
Our results can be used to assess the influence of dust scattering in other eclipsing X-ray sources,
and raise the importance of considering the timing effects of dust scattering halo when studying
the variability of other X-ray sources in the GC, such as Sgr A*. Moreover, our study of halo eclipse
reinforces the existence of a dust layer local to AX J1745.6-2901 as reported by Jin et al. (2017),
as well as identifying another dust layer within a few hundred parsecs to Earth, containing up to
several tens of percent LOS dust, which is likely to be associated with the molecular clouds in the
Solar neighbourhood. The remaining LOS dust is likely to be associated with the molecular clouds
located in the Galactic disk in-between.
