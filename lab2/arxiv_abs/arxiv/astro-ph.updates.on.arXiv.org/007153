HD 21190 is a known $\delta$ Scuti star showing Ap star characteristics and a variability period
of 3.6 h discovered by the Hipparcos mission. Using Gaia DR1 data for an astrometric analysis, it
was recently suggested that HD 21190 forms a physical binary system with the companion CPD -83$^{\circ}$
64B. An atmospheric chemical analysis based on HARPS observations revealed the presence of overabundances
of heavy and rare-earth elements, which are typically observed in chemically peculiar stars with
large-scale organized magnetic fields. Previous observations of HD 21190 indicated a magnetic
field strength of a few hundred Gauss. The presence of a magnetic field in CPD -83$^{\circ}$ 64B remained
unexplored. In this work, we reanalyse this system using Gaia DR2 data and present our search for
the magnetic field in both stars based on multi-epoch HARPSpol high-resolution and FORS 2 low-resolution
spectropolarimetric observations. The Gaia DR2 results clearly indicate that the two star are
not physically associated. A magnetic field detection at a significance level of more than 6$\sigma$
($\left< B_{\rm z}\right>_{\rm all}=230\pm38$ G) was achieved for the $\delta$ Scuti variable
HD 21190 in FORS 2 observations using the entire spectrum for the measurements. The magnetic field
appears to be stronger in CPD -83$^{\circ}$ 64B. The highest value for the longitudinal magnetic
field in CPD -83$^{\circ}$ 64B, $\left< B_{\rm z}\right>_{\rm all}=509\pm104$ G, is measured
at a significance level of 4.9$\sigma$. Furthermore, the high-resolution HARPS\-pol observations
of this component indicate the presence of pulsational variability on a time scale of tens of minutes.
