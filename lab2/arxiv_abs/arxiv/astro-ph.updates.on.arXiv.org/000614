In this work we present cosmological N-body simulations of the Local Universe with initial conditions
constrained by the Two-Micron Redshift Survey (2MRS) within a cubic volume of 180 Mpc/h side-length
centred at the Local Group. We use a self-consistent Bayesian based approach to explore the joint
parameter space of primordial density fluctuations and peculiar velocity fields, which are compatible
with the 2MRS galaxy distribution after cosmic evolution. This method (the KIGEN-code) includes
the novel ALPT (Augmented Lagrangian Perturbation Theory) structure formation model which combines
second order LPT (2LPT) on large scales with the spherical collapse model on small scales. Furthermore
we describe coherent flows with 2LPT and include a dispersion term to model fingers-of-god (fogs)
arising from virialised structures. These implementations are crucial to avoid artificial filamentary
structures, which appear when using a structure formation model with 2LPT and data with compressed
fogs. We assume LCDM cosmology throughout our method. The recovered initial Gaussian fields are
used to perform a set of 25 constrained simulations. Statistically this ensemble of simulations
is in agreement with a reference set of 25 simulations based on randomly seeded Gaussian fluctuations
in terms of matter statistics, power-spectra and mass functions. Considering the entire volume
of (180 Mpc/h)^3 we obtain correlation coefficients of about 98.3% for the cell-to-cell comparison
between the simulated density fields and the galaxy density field in log-space with Gaussian smoothing
scales of r_S=3.5 Mpc\h (74% for r_S=1.4 Mpc/h). The cross power-spectra show correlations with
the galaxy distribution down to scales of 2.2-3.0 Mpc/h. The simulations we present provide a fully
nonlinear density and velocity field with a high level of correlation with the observed galaxy distribution
at scales of a few Mpc.
