In this paper, transient high energy events and their hosts are discussed with focus on signatures
of radio synchrotron emission. Outstanding questions range from the origin of the two phases of
radio emission in supernovae to the formation of conical jets launched at relativistic velocities
in active nuclei to the formation of radio hotspots in FR II sources to the formation of radio relics
and halos in clusters of galaxies to the origin of the relativistic electron population and its energy
spectrum which is responsible for the synchrotron emission to the composition of the radio synchrotron-emitting
plasma in these sources. Observations have helped build an empirical model of active nuclei but
the origin of the narrow line regions, broad line regions, dust, accretion disk in active nuclei
and their connection to radio jets and lobes remains largely unknown. This paper attempts to understand
and resolve these. A few results are: 1 The matter ejected in a transient explosive events have to
be energised, before ejection, to escape velocity. An important source of transient explosive
energy in the universe is thermonuclear. The energy spectrum of the particles energised in such
events will follow a normal/gaussian distribution ; 2 The prompt radio synchrotron emission from
a supernova is from a positron-electron plasma whereas the delayed radio synchrotron from supernova
remnants is due to the relativistic proton-electron plasma mixed with the thermal plasma ; 3 Jets
and narrow line gas are launched from the polar regions of the pseudosurface of the rotating black
hole in active nuclei by the energy released in a thermonuclear outburst in the accreted matter.
Synchrotron jets are composed of positron-electron plasma.
