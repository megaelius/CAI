Stellar halos offer direct fossil evidence for hierarchical structure formation. Since halo assembly
is predicted to be scale-free, the properties of stellar halos around low-mass galaxies set strong
constraints on star formation in the accreted subhalos and on the formation of all dwarf galaxies.
However, few observational searches for stellar halos in dwarfs exist. Here we present $g$ and $i$
photometry of resolved stars in the isolated Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy IC 1613 ($M_{\star}
\sim 10^8 M_{\odot})$. These Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam observations are the widest and deepest
observations of IC 1613 to date. We measure surface density profiles of young main-sequence stars,
intermediate to old red-giant branch stars, and ancient horizontal branch stars outside of $12'$
($\sim 2.6$ kpc; 2.5 half-light radii) from the center of the galaxy. All of the populations extend
out to $\sim 24'$ ($\sim 5.2$ kpc; 5 half-light radii), with the older populations best fit by a broken
exponential in these outer regions. Comparing with earlier studies sensitive to IC 1613's inner
regions shows that the stellar density of the old stellar populations steepens substantially with
distance from the center, and we trace the effective surface brightness down to an extremely faint
limit of $\sim 33.7$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ (in the $g$ band). Conversely, the distribution of younger
stars follows a single, shallow exponential profile in the outer regions, demonstrating different
formation channels for the younger and older components of IC 1613. The outermost, intermediate-age
and old stars have properties consistent with those expected for accreted stellar halos, though
future observational and theoretical work is needed to definitively distinguish this scenario
from other possibilities.
