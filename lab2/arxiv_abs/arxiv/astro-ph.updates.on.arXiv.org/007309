The duration of quasar accretion episodes is a key quantity for distinguishing between models for
the formation and growth of supermassive black holes, the evolution of quasars, and their potential
feedback effects on their host galaxies. However, this critical timescale, often referred to as
the quasar lifetime, is still uncertain by orders of magnitude ($t_{\rm Q} \simeq 0.01\,{\rm Myr}
- 1\,{\rm Gyr}$). Absorption spectra of quasars exhibiting transmission in the He II Ly$\alpha$
forest provide a unique opportunity to make precise measurements of the quasar lifetime. Indeed,
the size of a quasar's He II proximity zone, the region near the quasar itself where its own radiation
dramatically alters the ionization state of the surrounding intergalactic medium (IGM), depends
sensitively on its lifetime for $t_{\rm Q}\lesssim 30$ Myr, comparable to the expected $e$-folding
time-scale for SMBH growth $t_{\rm S}=45$ Myr. In this study we compare the sizes of He II proximity
zones in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) spectra of 6 z~4 quasars to theoretical models generated
by post-processing cosmological hydrodynamical simulations with $1$D radiative transfer algorithm.
We introduce a Bayesian statistical method to infer the lifetimes of individual quasars which allows
us to fully marginalize over the unknown ionization state of the surrounding IGM. We measure lifetimes
$0.63^{+0.82}_{-0.40}$ Myr and $5.75^{+4.72}_{-2.74}$ Myr for two objects. For the other 4 quasars
large redshift uncertainties undermine our sensitivity allowing us to only place upper or lower
limits. However a joint analysis of these four systems yields a measurement of their average lifetime
of $\langle t_{\rm Q}\rangle = 1.17^{+1.77}_{-0.84}$ Myr. We discuss our short ~1 Myr inferred
lifetimes in the context of other quasar lifetime constraints and the growth of SMBHs.
