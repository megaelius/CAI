We present an analysis of a sample of 69 local obscured Swift/Burst Alert Telescope active galactic
nuclei (AGNs) with X-ray spectra from NuSTAR and infrared (IR) spectral energy distributions from
Herschel and WISE. We combine this X-ray and IR phenomenological modeling and find a significant
correlation between reflected hard X-ray emission and IR AGN emission, with suggestive indications
that this correlation may be stronger than the one between intrinsic hard X-ray and IR emissions.
This relation between the IR and reflected X-ray emission suggests that both are the result of the
processing of intrinsic emission from the corona and accretion disk by the same structure. We explore
the resulting implications on the underlying distribution of covering fraction for all AGNs, by
generating mock observables for the reflection parameter and IR luminosity ratio using empirical
relations found for the covering fraction with each quantity. We find that the observed distributions
of the reflection parameter and IR-to-X-ray ratio are reproduced with broad distributions centered
around covering fractions of at least ~40%-50%, whereas narrower distributions match our observations
only when centered around covering fractions of ~70%-80%. Our results are consistent with both
independent estimates of the covering fractions of individual objects and the typical covering
fraction obtained on the basis of obscured fractions for samples of AGNs. These results suggest
that the level of reprocessing in AGNs, including X-ray reflection, is related in a relatively straightforward
way to the geometry of the obscuring material.
