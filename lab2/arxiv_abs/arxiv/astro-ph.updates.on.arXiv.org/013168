Population studies of the orbital characteristics of exoplanets in multi-planet systems highlighted
the existence of an anti-correlation between the average orbital eccentricity of planets and the
number of planets of their host system (i.e. its multiplicity). This effect was proposed to reflect
the different violence of the dynamical evolution of the planetary systems. Previous work suggested
that the relative violence of the dynamical evolution of planetary systems with similar orbital
architectures can be compared through the computation of their angular momentum deficit (AMD).
We investigated the possibility of using a more general metric to perform analogous comparisons
between planetary systems with different orbital architectures. We considered a modified version
of the AMD, the normalized angular momentum deficit (NAMD), and used it to study a sample of 99 multi-planet
systems containing both the currently best-characterized extrasolar systems and the Solar System,
i.e. planetary systems with both compact and wide orbital architectures. We verified that the NAMD
allows to compare the violence of the dynamical histories of multi-planet systems with different
orbital architectures. We identified an anti-correlation between the NAMD and the multiplicity
of the planetary systems, of which the previously observed eccentricity--multiplicity anti--correlation
is a reflection. Our results seem to indicate that phases of dynamical instabilities and chaotic
evolution are not uncommon among planetary systems. They also suggest that the efficiency of the
planetary formation process in producing high-multiplicity systems is likely higher that suggested
by their currently known population.
