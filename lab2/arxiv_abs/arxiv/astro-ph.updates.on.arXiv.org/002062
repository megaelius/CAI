We investigate the dependence of the Fanaroff-Riley (FR) 1/2 dichotomy of radio galaxies on their
luminosities and redshifts. Because of a very strong redshift-luminosity correlation (Malmquist
bias) in a flux-limited sample, any redshift-dependent effect could appear as a luminosity related
effect and vice versa. A question could then arise - do all the morphological differences seen in
the two classes (FR 1 and 2 types) of sources, usually attributed to the differences in their luminosities,
could as well be primarily a redshift-dependent effect? A sharp break in luminosity, seen among
the two classes, could after all reflect a sharp redshift-dependence due to a rather critical ambient
density value at some cosmic epoch. A doubt on these lines does not seem to have been raised in past
and things have never been examined with this particular aspect in mind. We want to ascertain the
customary prevalent view in the literature that the systematic differences in the two broad morphology
types of FR 1 and 2 radio galaxies are indeed due to the differences in their luminosities, and not
due to a change in redshift. Here we investigate the dependence of FR 1/2 dichotomy of radio galaxies
on luminosity and redshift by using the 3CR sample, where the FR 1/2 dichotomy was first seen, supplemented
by data from an additional sample (MRC), that goes about a factor of 5 or more deeper in flux-density
than the original 3CR sample. This lets us compare sources with similar luminosities but at different
redshifts as well as examine sources at similar redshifts but with different luminosities, thereby
allowing us a successful separation of the otherwise two intricately entangled effects. We find
that the morphology type is not directly related to redshift and the break between the two types of
morphologies seems to depend only upon the radio luminosity.
