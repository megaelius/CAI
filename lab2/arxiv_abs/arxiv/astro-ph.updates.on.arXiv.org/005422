Our goal is to morphologically classify the sources identified in the images of the J-PLUS early
data release (EDR) into compact (stars) or extended (galaxies) using a suited Bayesian classifier.
J-PLUS sources exhibit two distinct populations in the r-band magnitude vs. concentration plane,
corresponding to compact and extended sources. We modelled the two-population distribution with
a skewed Gaussian for compact objects and a log-normal function for the extended ones. The derived
model and the number density prior based on J-PLUS EDR data were used to estimate the Bayesian probability
of a source to be star or galaxy. This procedure was applied pointing-by-pointing to account for
varying observing conditions and sky position. Finally, we combined the morphological information
from g, r, and i broad bands in order to improve the classification of low signal-to-noise sources.
The derived probabilities are used to compute the pointing-by-pointing number counts of stars
and galaxies. The former increases as we approach to the Milky Way disk, and the latter are similar
across the probed area. The comparison with SDSS in the common regions is satisfactory up to r ~ 21,
with consistent numbers of stars and galaxies, and consistent distributions in concentration
and (g - i) colour spaces. We implement a morphological star/galaxy classifier based on PDF analysis,
providing meaningful probabilities for J-PLUS sources to one magnitude deeper (r ~ 21) than a classical
boolean classification. These probabilities are suited for the statistical study of 150k stars
and 101k galaxies with 15 < r < 21 present in the 31.7 deg2 of the J-PLUS EDR. In a future version of the
classifier, we will include J-PLUS colour information from twelve photometric bands.
