In this paper we report on a major theoretical observation in cosmology. We present a concrete cosmological
model for which inflation has natural beginning and natural ending. Inflation is driven by a cosine-form
potential, $V(\phi)= \Lambda^4 (1-\cos(\phi/f))$, which begins at $\phi \lesssim \pi f$ and ends
at $\phi =\phi_{\rm end} \lesssim 5 f/3$. The distance traversed by the inflaton field $\phi$ is
sub-Planckian. The Gauss-Bonnet term ${\cal R}^2$ arising as leading curvature corrections in
the action $S = \int d^5{x} \sqrt{-g_{5}} M^3 (- 6\lambda M^2 + R + \alpha M^{-2} {\cal R}^2)+ \int
d^{4}x \sqrt{-g_{4}} (\dot{\phi}^2/2 - V(\phi)- \sigma +{\cal L}_{\text matter})$ (where $\alpha$
and $\lambda$ are constants and $M$ is the five-dimensional Planck mass) plays a key role to terminate
inflation. The model generates appropriate tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and inflationary perturbations
that are consistent with results from \textit{Planck} and BICEP2. For example, for $N_*= 50-60$
and $n_s\sim 0.960\pm 0.005$, the model predicts that $M\sim 5.64\times 10^{16}\,{\rm GeV}$ and
$r\sim (0.14-0.21)$ ($N_*$ is the number of e-folds of inflation and $n_s$ ($n_{t}$) is the scalar
(tensor) spectrum spectral index). The ratio $-n_t/r$ is (13 -- 24)% less than its value in 4D Einstein
gravity, $-n_t/r=1/8$. The upper bound on the energy scale of inflation $V^{1/4}=2.37\times 10^{16}\,{\text
GeV}$ ($r<0.27$) implies that $(-\lambda \alpha) \gtrsim 75 \times 10^{-5}$ and $\Lambda<2.17\times
10^{16}\,{\text GeV}$, which thereby rule out the case $\alpha=0$ (Randall-Sundrum model). The
true nature of gravity is holographic as implied by braneworld realisation of string and M theory.
The model correctly predicts a late epoch cosmic acceleration with the dark energy equation of state
${\text w}_{\text DE}\approx -1$.
