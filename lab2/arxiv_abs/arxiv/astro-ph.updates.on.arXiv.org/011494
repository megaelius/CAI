In this paper, we present a scheme to investigate the opacity of the Universe in a cosmological-model-independent
way, with the combination of current and future measurements of type Ia supernova sample and galactic-scale
strong gravitational lensing systems with SNe Ia acting as background sources. The observational
data include the current newly-compiled SNe Ia data (Pantheon sample) and simulated sample of SNe
Ia observed by the forthcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) survey, which are taken for
luminosity distances ($D_L$) possibly affected by the cosmic opacity, as well as strongly lensed
SNe Ia observed by the LSST, which are responsible for providing the observed time-delay distance
($D_{\Delta t}$) unaffected by the cosmic opacity. Two parameterizations, $\tau(z)=2\beta z$
and $\tau(z)=(1+z)^{2\beta}-1$ are adopted for the optical depth associated to the cosmic absorption.
Focusing on only one specific type of standard cosmological probe, this provides an original method
to measure cosmic opacity at high precision. Working on the simulated sample of strongly lensed
SNe Ia observed by the LSST in 10 year $z$-band search, our results show that, with the combination
of the current newly-compiled SNe Ia data (Pantheon sample), there is no significant deviation
from the transparency of the Universe at the current observational data level. Moreover, strongly
lensed SNe Ia in a 10 year LSST $z$-band search would produce more robust constraints on the validity
of cosmic transparency (at the precision of $\Delta\beta=10^{-2}$), with a larger sample of unlensed
SNe Ia detected in future LSST survey. We have also discussed the ways in which our methodology could
be improved, with the combination of current and future available data in gravitational wave (GW)
and electromagnetic (EM) domain.
