Accurately predicting the abundance and structural evolution of dark matter subhaloes is crucial
for understanding galaxy formation, modeling galaxy clustering, and constraining the nature
of dark matter. Due to the nonlinear nature of subhalo evolution, cosmological $N$-body simulations
remain its primary method of investigation. However, it has recently been demonstrated that such
simulations are still heavily impacted by artificial disruption, diminishing the information
content on small scales and reducing the reliability of all simulation-calibrated semi-analytical
models. In this paper, we utilize the recently released DASH library of high-resolution, idealized
simulations of the tidal evolution of subhaloes, which are unhindered by numerical overmerging
due to discreteness noise or force softening, to calibrate an improved, more-accurate model of
the evolution of the density profiles of subhaloes that undergo tidal heating and stripping within
their host halo. By testing previous findings that the structural evolution of a tidally truncated
subhalo depends solely on the fraction of mass stripped, independent of the details of the stripping,
we identify an additional dependence on the initial subhalo concentration. We provide significantly
improved fitting functions for the subhalo density profiles and structural parameters ($V_\mathrm{max}$
and $r_\mathrm{max}$) that are unimpeded by numerical systematics and applicable to a wide range
of parameter space. This model will be an integral component of a future semi-analytical treatment
of substructure evolution, which can be used to predict key quantities, such as the evolved subhalo
mass function and annihilation boost factors, and validate such calculations performed with cosmological
simulations.
