Isolated brown dwarfs provide remarkable laboratories for understanding atmospheric physics
in the low-irradiation regime, and can be observed more precisely than exoplanets. As such, they
provide a glimpse into the future of high-SNR observations of exoplanets. In this work, we investigate
several new considerations that are important for atmospheric retrievals of high-quality thermal
emission spectra of sub-stellar objects. We pursue this using an adaptation of the HyDRA atmospheric
retrieval code. We propose a parametric pressure-temperature (P-T) profile for brown dwarfs consisting
of multiple atmospheric layers, parameterised by the temperature change across each layer. This
model allows the steep temperature gradient of brown dwarf atmospheres to be accurately retrieved
while avoiding commonly-encountered numerical artefacts. The P-T model is especially flexible
in the photosphere, which can reach a few tens of bar for T-dwarfs. We demonstrate an approach to include
model uncertainties in the retrieval, focusing on uncertainties introduced by finite spectral
and vertical resolution in the atmospheric model used for retrieval (~8\% in the present case).
We validate our retrieval framework by applying it to a simulated data set and then apply it to the
HST/WFC3 spectrum of the T-dwarf 2MASS J2339+1352. We retrieve sub-solar abundances of H2O and
CH4 in the object at ~0.1 dex precision. Additionally, we constrain the temperature structure to
within ~100 K in the photosphere. Our results demonstrate the promise of high-SNR spectra to provide
high-precision abundance estimates of sub-stellar objects.
