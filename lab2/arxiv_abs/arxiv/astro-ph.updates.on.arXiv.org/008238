The characterisation of galaxy-scale outflows in terms of their multi-phase nature, amount, and
effects of flowing material is crucial to place constraints on models of galaxy evolution. This
study can proceed only with the detailed investigation of individual targets. We present a spatially
resolved spectroscopic optical data analysis of Mkn 848, a complex system consisting of two merging
galaxies at z~0.04 that are separated 7.5 kpc (projected distance). Motivated by the presence of
a multi-phase outflow in the north-west system revealed by the SDSS integrated spectrum, we analysed
the publicly available MaNGA data, which cover almost the entire merging system, to study the physical
properties of cool and warm gas in detail. Galaxy-wide outflowing gas in multiple phases is revealed
for the first time in the two merging galaxies. We also detect spatially resolved resonant NaID emission
associated with the outflows. The derived outflow energetics may be consistent with a scenario
in which both winds are accelerated by stellar processes and AGN activity, although we favour an
AGN origin given the high outflow velocities and the ionisation conditions observed in the outflow
regions. Deeper observations are required, however, to better constrain the nature of these multi-phase
outflows. Outflow energetics in the north-west system are strongly different between the ionised
and atomic gas components, the latter of which is associated with mass outflow rate and kinetic and
momentum powers that are 1-2 dex higher; those associated with the south-east galaxy are instead
similar. Strong kp-scale outflows are revealed in an ongoing merger system, suggesting that feedback
can potentially impact the host galaxy even in the early merger phases. The characterisation of
the neutral and ionised gas phases has proved to be crucial for a comprehensive study of the outflow
phenomena.
