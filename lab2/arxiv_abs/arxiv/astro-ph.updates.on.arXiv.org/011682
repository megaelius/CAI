We present a statistical analysis of the optical properties of an X-ray selected Type 1 AGN sample,
using high signal to-noise ratio ($S/N>20$) spectra of the counterparts of the ROSAT/2RXS sources
in the footprint of the SDSS-IV/SPIDERS (Spectroscopic IDentification of eROSITA Sources) programme.
The final sample contains 2100 sources. It significantly extends the redshift and luminosity ranges
($\rm z \sim 0.01 - 0.80$ and $\rm L_{0.1-2.4 \,keV}$ ~ $\rm 2.0 \times 10^{41}$ - $\rm 1.0 \times 10^{46}
\, erg s^{-1}$ ) used so far in this kind of analysis. By means of a Principal Component Analysis, we
derive Eigenvector (EV) 1 and 2 in an eleven dimensional optical and X-ray parameter space, which
are consistent with previous results. The validity of the correlations of the Eddington ratio $\rm
L/L_{Edd}$ with EV1 and the black hole mass with EV2 are strongly confirmed These results imply that
$\rm L/L_{Edd}$ and black hole mass are related to the diversity of the optical properties of Type
1 AGN. Investigating the relation of the width and asymmetry of $\rm H\beta$ and the relative strength
of the iron emission $\rm r_{FeII}$ , we show that our analysis supports the presence of a distinct
kinematic region: the Very Broad Line Region. Furthermore, comparing sources with a red-asymmetric
broad $\rm H\beta$ emission line to sources for which it is blue-asymmetric, we find an intriguing
difference in the correlation of the FeII and the continuum emission strengths. We show that this
contrasting behaviour is consistent with a flattened, stratified model of the Broad Line Region,
in which the FeII emitting region is shielded from the central source.
