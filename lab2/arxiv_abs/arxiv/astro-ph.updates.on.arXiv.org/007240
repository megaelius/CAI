Solar twins are objects of great interest in that they allow us to understand better how stellar evolution
and structure are affected by variations of the stellar mass, age and chemical composition in the
vicinity of the commonly accepted solar values. We aim to use the existing spectrophotometric,
interferometric and asteroseismic data for the solar twin 18 Sco to constrain stellar evolution
models. 18 Sco is the brightest solar twin and is a good benchmark for the study of solar twins. The
goal is to obtain realistic estimates of its physical characteristics (mass, age, initial chemical
composition, mixing-length parameter) and realistic associated uncertainties using stellar
models. We set up a Bayesian model that relates the statistical properties of the data to the probability
density of the stellar parameters. Special care is given to the modelling of the likelihood for the
seismic data, using Gaussian mixture models. The probability densities of the stellar parameters
are approximated numerically using an adaptive MCMC algorithm. From these approximate distributions
we proceeded to a statistical analysis. We also performed the same exercise using local optimisation.
The precision on the mass is approximately 6%. The precision reached on X0 and Z0 and the mixing-length
parameter are respectively 6%, 9%, and 35%. The posterior density for the age is bimodal, with modes
at 4.67 Gyr and 6.95 Gyr, the first one being slightly more likely. We show that this bimodality is
directly related to the structure of the seismic data. When asteroseismic data or interferometric
data are excluded, we find significant losses of precision for the mass and the initial hydrogen-mass
fraction. Our final estimates of the uncertainties from the Bayesian analysis are significantly
larger than values inferred from local optimization.
