Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are good candidates to explain star formation quenching, depending
on the coupling between the energy they re-inject in the galaxy and the interstellar medium. The
purpose of this study is to model and quantify the impact of AGN long-range ionizing radiation --
on top of the often considered small-scale energy deposition -- on the physical state of the gas of
the host-galaxy, and therefore on its ability to form stars. We formulated an AGN Spectral Energy
Distribution, which we used with the radiative transfer code Cloudy to compute ionization in a simulated
high-redshift disk-galaxy. This simulation has a high resolution ($\sim$ 6 pc) and includes standard
thermal AGN feedback, and we calculate the radiative transfer in post-processing. Surprisingly,
while these models give birth to significant AGN-driven outflows, we find that the reduction in
Star Formation Rate due to ionization radiation and thermal heating is of a few percents at most for
a quasar luminosity ($L_{bol}=10^{46.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$). Despite the large fraction of volume
ionized, the corresponding mass fraction remains small because the density of the affected gas
is low. We conclude that most dense star-forming clouds are left unaffected, and even their envelopes
of cool atomic gas are generally too dense to be significantly heated or ionized. Therefore, while
the AGN-driven outflows can remove substantial amounts of gas on the long-term, the impact of AGN
feedback on the Star Formation Efficiency in the interstellar gas in high-redshift galaxies is
marginal, even when long-range radiative effects are accounted for.
