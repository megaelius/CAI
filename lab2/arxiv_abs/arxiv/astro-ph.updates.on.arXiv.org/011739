We demonstrate how the total luminosity in satellite galaxies is a powerful probe of dark matter
halos around central galaxies. The method cross-correlates central galaxies in spectroscopic
galaxy samples with fainter galaxies detected in photometric surveys. After background subtraction,
the excess galaxies around the central galaxies represent faint satellite galaxies within the
dark matter halo. Using abundance matching models, we show that the the total galaxy luminosity,
L_sat, scales linearly with host halo mass, making L_sat an excellent proxy for M_h. L_sat is also
sensitive to the formation time of the halo, as younger halos have more substructure at fixed M_h.
We demonstrate that probes of galaxy large-scale environment can break this degeneracy. Although
this is an indirect probe of the halo, it can yield a high-S/N measurement for galaxies expected to
occupy halos at $<10^{12}$ M_sol, where other methods suffer from larger errors. In this paper we
focus on observational and theoretical systematics in the L_sat method. We test the robustness
of our method of finding central galaxies and our methods of estimating the number of background
galaxies. We implement this method on central galaxies in SDSS data, with satellites identified
in faint imaging from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. We find excellent agreement between our theoretical
predictions and the observational measurements. Finally, we compare our L_sat measurements to
weak lensing estimates of M_h for red and blue subsamples. In the stellar mass range where the measurements
overlap, we find consistent results, where red galaxies live in larger halos. However, the L_sat
approach allows us to probe significantly lower mass galaxies. At these masses, the L_sat values
are equivalent. This example shows the potential of L_sat as a probe of dark halos. (Abridged)
