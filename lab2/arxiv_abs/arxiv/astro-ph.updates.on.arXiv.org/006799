Magnetic reconnection is invoked as an efficient particle accelerator in a variety of astrophysical
sources of non-thermal high-energy radiation. With large-scale two-dimensional particle-in-cell
simulations of relativistic reconnection (i.e., with magnetization $\sigma\gg1$) in pair plasmas,
we study the long-term evolution of the power-law slope and high-energy cutoff of the spectrum of
accelerated particles. We find that the high-energy spectral cutoff does not saturate at $\gamma_{\rm
cut}\sim 4\sigma$, as claimed by earlier studies, but it steadily grows with time as long as the reconnection
process stays active. At late times, the cutoff scales approximately as $\gamma_{\rm cut}\propto
\sqrt{t}$, regardless of the flow magnetization and initial temperature. We show that the particles
dominating the high-energy spectral cutoff reside in plasmoids, and in particular in a strongly
magnetised ring around the plasmoid core. The growth of their energy is driven by the increase in
the local field strength, coupled with the conservation of the first adiabatic invariant. We also
find that the power-law slope of the spectrum ($p=-{\rm d}\log N/{\rm d}\log \gamma$) evolves with
time. For $\sigma\gtrsim10$, the spectrum is hard at early times ($p\lesssim 2$), but it tends to
asymptote to $p\sim 2$; the steepening of the power-law slope allows the spectral cutoff to extend
to higher and higher energies, without violating the fixed energy budget of the system. Our results
demonstrate that relativistic reconnection is a viable candidate for accelerating the high-energy
particles emitting in relativistic astrophysical sources.
