Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs: masses between $100 - 10^{6} M_{\odot}$) historically
comprise of an elusive population compared to stellar-mass and supermassive BHs. Recently IMBHs
have started to be observed at the centers of low-mass galaxies. Using a modified version of the SPH
code GADGET-3, we perform small-volume cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, and investigate
the growth and feedback of central IMBHs in dwarf galaxies (DGs). Black Holes of mass $(10^{2} - 10^{4})
M_{\odot}$ are seeded at the centers of halos with $(10^{6} - 5 \times 10^{7}) M_{\odot}$. The earliest
BHs appear at $z \sim 18 - 25$, and grow thereafter by accreting surrounding gas and by merger with
other BHs. We find that it is possible to build up IMBHs of a few$\times 10^{5} - 10^{6} M_{\odot}$
by $z = 5$, when the BHs are seeded in halos less massive than $4 \times 10^{7} M_{\odot}$. The star
formation rate density evolution of the DGs (stellar mass $10^{5} - 10^{8} M_{\odot}$) has a peak
plateau between $z = 4 - 6$. Star formation is quenched between $z = 9 - 4$ by BH accretion and feedback.
The star formation rate density (SFRD) is reduced by factors up to $3$, when the BHs have grown to a
few times $10^5 M_{\odot}$. However these IMBHs in DGs are already more massive (at $z \sim 6$) compared
to the local $[M_{\rm BH} - M_{\star}]$ correlation and that of high-$z$ quasars. Our conclusions,
based on numerical simulation results, support the scenario that early feedback from IMBHs in gas-rich
DGs at $z = 5 - 8$ can potentially solve several anomalies in the DG mass range within the concordance
$\Lambda$CDM cosmological scenario of galaxy formation (Silk 2017). Our results suggest that
IMBHs at DG centers grow faster than their host galaxies in the early Universe, and the resulting
BH feedback turns the DGs and the BHs dormant. (Abridged)
