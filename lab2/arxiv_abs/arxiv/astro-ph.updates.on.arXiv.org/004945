We present an original phenomenological model to describe the evolution of galaxy number counts,
morphologies, and spectral energy distributions across a wide range of redshifts ($0.2<z<15$)
and stellar masses [$\log(\mathrm{M}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})\ge6$]. Our model follows observed
mass and luminosity functions of both star-forming and quiescent galaxies, and reproduces the
redshift evolution of colors, sizes, star-formation and chemical properties of the observed galaxy
population. Unlike other existing approaches, our model includes a self-consistent treatment
of stellar and photoionized gas emission and dust attenuation based on the BEAGLE tool. The mock
galaxy catalogs generated with our new model can be used to simulate and optimize extragalactic
surveys with future facilities such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and to enable critical
assessments of analysis procedures, interpretation tools, and measurement systematics for both
photometric and spectroscopic data. As a first application of this work, we make predictions for
the upcoming JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), a joint program of the JWST/NIRCam
and NIRSpec Guaranteed Time Observations teams. We show that JADES will detect, with NIRCam imaging,
thousands of galaxies at $z\gtrsim6$, and tens at $z\gtrsim10$ at m$_{AB}\lesssim$30 (5$\sigma$)
within the $\sim200$ $\mathrm{arcmin}^2$ of the survey. The JADES data will enable accurate constraints
on the evolution of the UV luminosity function at $z>8$, and resolve the current debate about the
rate of evolution of galaxies at $z\gtrsim8$. Realizations of the mock catalog are publicly available,
along with a Python package that can be used to generate new realizations.
