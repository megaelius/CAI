Synchrotron emission polarization is very sensitive to the magnetic field configuration. Recently,
polarization of synchrotron emission with a mixed (SM) magnetic field in Gamma-ray burst (GRB)
afterglow phase had been developed. Here, we apply these SM models to GRB prompt phase and compare
their polarization properties with that of synchrotron emission in purely ordered (SO) magnetic
field. We find that the polarization properties in a SM model are very similar to these in a corresponding
SO model (e.g., synchrotron emission in a mixed magnetic field with an aligned ordered part (SMA)
and synchrotron emission with a purely ordered aligned magnetic field (SOA)), only with a lower
polarization degree (PD). We also discuss the statistical properties of the models. We find PDs
of the simulated bursts are concentrated around $25\%$ for both SOA and synchrotron emission in
a purely ordered toroidal magnetic field (SOT), while they can range from $0\%$ to $25\%$ for SMA
and synchrotron emission in a mixed magnetic field with a toroidal ordered part (SMT), depending
on $\xi_B$ value, i.e., the ratio of magnetic reduction of the ordered magnetic field over that of
random magnetic field. From statistics, if PDs of majority GRBs are non-zero, then it favours SO
and SM models. Further, if there are some bright GRBs with a prominently lower PDs than that of the
majority GRBs, it favours SOT (SMT) models; if all the bright GRBs have comparable PDs with the majority
ones, it favours SOA (SMA) models. Finally, we apply our results to POLAR's data and find that $\sim10\%$
time-integrated PDs of the observed bursts favor SMA and SMT models, and $\xi_B$ parameter of these
bursts is constrained to be around 1.135.
