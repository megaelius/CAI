We present the pilot study component of the Fluorescent Lyman-Alpha Structures in High-z Environments
(FLASHES) Survey; the largest integral-field spectroscopy survey to date of the circumgalactic
medium at $z=2.3-3.1$. We observed 48 quasar fields between 2015 and 2018 with the Palomar Cosmic
Web Imager (Matuszewski et al. 2010). Extended HI Lyman-$\mathrm{\alpha}$ emission is discovered
around 42/48 of the observed quasars, ranging in projected, flux-weighted radius from 21-71 proper
kiloparsecs (pkpc), with 26 nebulae exceeding $100\mathrm{~pkpc}$ in effective diameter. The
circularly averaged surface brightness radial profile peaks at a maximum of $\mathrm{1\times
10^{-17}~erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}~arcsec^{-2}}$ ($2\times10^{-15}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}~arcsec^{-2}}$
adjusted for cosmological dimming) and luminosities range from $1.9\times10^{43}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$
to $-14.1\times10^{43}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$. The emission appears to have a highly eccentric
morphology and a maximum covering factor of $50\%$ ($60\%$ for giant nebulae). On average, the nebular
spectra are red-shifted with respect to both the systemic redshift and Ly$\alpha$ peak of the quasar
spectrum. The integrated spectra of the nebulae mostly have single or double-peaked line shapes
with global dispersions ranging from $167~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ to $690~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$,
though the individual (Gaussian) components of lines with complex shapes mostly appear to have
dispersions $\leq 400$ $\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$, and the flux-weighted velocity centroids of the
lines vary by thousands of $ \mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ with respect to the systemic QSO redshifts. Finally,
the root-mean-square velocities of the nebulae are found to be consistent with (i.e., not exceeding)
gravitational motions expected in host dark matter halos of QSOs at this redshift. We compare these
results to existing surveys at both higher and lower redshift.
