Previous studies have related surface temperature maps, obtained with the Doppler imaging (DI)
technique, of LQ Hya with long-term photometry. We compare surface magnetic field maps, obtained
with the Zeeman Doppler imaging (ZDI) technique, with contemporaneous photometry, with the aim
of quantifying the star's magnetic cycle characteristics. We inverted Stokes IV spectropolarimetry
into magnetic field and surface brightness maps using a tomographic inversion code that models
high signal-to-noise ratio mean line profiles produced by the least squares deconvolution (LSD)
technique. The magnetic field and surface brightness maps reveal similar patterns to previous
DI and ZDI studies: non-axisymmetric polar magnetic field structure, void of fields at mid-latitudes,
and a complex structure in the equatorial regions. There is a weak but clear tendency of the polar
structures to be linked with strong radial field and the equatorial ones with the azimuthal. We find
a polarity reversal in the radial field between 2016 and 2017 coincident with an activity minimum
seen in the long-term photometry. The inverted field strengths cannot easily be related with the
observed spottedness, but we find that they are partially connected with the retrieved field complexity.
Comparing to global magnetoconvection models for rapidly rotating young Suns, this field topology
and dominance of the poloidal field component could be explained by a turbulent dynamo, where differential
rotation does not play a major role (so called alpha^2 Omega or alpha^2 dynamos), and axi- and non-axisymmetric
modes are excited simultaneously. The complex equatorial magnetic field structure could arise
from the twisted (helical) wreaths often seen in these simulations, while the polar feature would
be connected to the mostly poloidal non-axisymmetric component having a smooth spatial structure.
