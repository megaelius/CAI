We select a sample of 90 obscured (type2) AGN with 1.45<z<3.05 from the zCOSMOS-deep galaxy sample
by 5 sigma-detection of the high-ionization CIV {\lambda}1549 narrow emission line. The presence
of this feature in a galaxy spectrum is often associated with nuclear activity, and the selection
effectiveness has been also confirmed by ultraviolet (UV) emission line ratio diagnostic diagrams.
Applying the same selection technique, a sample of 102 unobscured (type 1) AGN was collected. Taking
advantage of the large amount of multi-band data available in the COSMOS field, we investigate the
properties of the CIV-selected type 2 AGN, focusing on their host galaxies, X-ray emission and UV
emission lines. Finally, we investigate the physical properties of the ionized gas in the Narrow
Line Region (NLR) of this type 2 AGN sample, combining the analysis of strong UV emission lines with
predictions from photo-ionization models. We find that, in order to successfully reproduce the
relative intensity of UV emission lines of the selected high-z type 2 AGN, two new ingredients in
the photo-ionization models are fundamental,i.e. small inner radii of the NLR (~90pc for LAGN =
10^45erg/s) and the internal dissipative micro-turbulence of the gas emitting clouds (with vmicr~100km/s).
With these modified models, we compute the gas-phase metallicity of the NLR, and our measurements
indicate a statistically significant evolution of the metal content with redshift. Finally, we
do not observe, in our CIV-selected type 2 AGN sample, a strong relationship between the NLR gas metallicity
and the stellar mass of the host galaxy.
