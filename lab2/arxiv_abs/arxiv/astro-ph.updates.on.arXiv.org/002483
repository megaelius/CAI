We study the possibility that hot Jupiters (HJs) are formed through secular gravitational interactions
between two planets in eccentric orbits with relatively low mutual inclinations ($\lesssim20^\circ$)
and friction due to tides raised on the planet by the host star. We term this migration mechanism Coplanar
High-eccentricity Migration because, like disk migration, it allows for migration to occur on
the same plane in which the planets formed. Coplanar High-eccentricity Migration can operate from
the following typical initial configurations: (i) inner planet in a circular orbit and the outer
planet with an eccentricity $\gtrsim0.67$ for $m_{\rm in}/m_{\rm out}(a_{\rm in}/a_{\rm out})^{1/2}\lesssim0.3$;
(ii) two eccentric ($\gtrsim0.5$) orbits for $m_{\rm in}/m_{\rm out}(a_{\rm in}/a_{\rm out})^{1/2}\lesssim0.16$.
A population synthesis study of hierarchical systems of two giant planets using the observed eccentricity
distribution of giant planets shows that Coplanar High-eccentricity Migration can produce HJs:
(i) in $\sim 3-5\%$ of our simulated systems; (ii) with a semi-major axis distribution that matches
the observations; (iii) with low stellar obliquities ($\lesssim30^\circ$). A different mechanism
is needed to create large obliquity HJs, either a different migration channel or a mechanism that
tilts the star or the proto-planetary disk. Coplanar High-eccentricity Migration predicts that
hot Jupiters should have distant ($a\gtrsim8$ AU) and with massive (most likely $\sim1-3$ more
massive than the HJ) companions in nearly coplanar (mutual inclinations $\lesssim 20^\circ$)
and moderately eccentric ($e\sim0.2-0.5$) orbits.
