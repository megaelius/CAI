The beyond-Horndeski gravity has recently been reformulated in the dark energy paradigm - which
has been dubbed, Unified Dark Energy (UDE). The evolution equations for the given UDE appear to correspond
to a non-conservative dark energy scenario, in which the total energy-momentum tensor is not conserved.
We investigate both the background cosmology and, the large-scale imprint of the UDE by probing
the angular power spectrum of galaxy number counts, on ultra-large scales; taking care to include
the full relativistic corrections in the observed overdensity. The background evolution shows
that only an effective mass smaller than the Planck mass is needed in the early universe in order for
predictions in the given theory to match current observational constraints. We found that the effective
mass-evolution-rate parameter, which drives the evolution of the UDE, acts to enhance the observed
power spectrum and, hence, relativistic effects (on ultra-large scales) by enlarging the UDE sound
horizon. Conversely, both the beyond-Horndeski parameter and the kineticity act to diminish the
observed power spectrum, by decreasing the UDE sound horizon. We also found that while the Doppler
effect remains significant at all epochs and, thus can not be ignored, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe,
the time-delay and the potential (difference) effects, respectively, only become significant
at epochs near z = 3 and beyond, and may be neglected at late epochs. The results show that relativistic
effects may hold the potential to distinguish different gravity models and, may be important in
putting constraints on the degrees of freedom of the models. Moreover, the Doppler effect alone,
can be used as an effective cosmological probe for the large scale structure and gravity models -
at all epochs.
