The physical origin of enhanced star formation activity in interacting galaxies remains an open
question. Knowing whether starbursts are triggered by an increase of the quantity of dense gas or
an increase of the star formation efficiency would improve our understanding of galaxy evolution
and allow to transpose the results obtained in the local Universe to high redshift galaxies. In this
paper, we analyze a parsec-resolution simulation of an Antennae-like model of interacting galaxies.
We find that the interplay of physical processes has complex and important variations in time and
space, through different combinations of mechanisms like tides, shear and turbulence. These can
have similar imprints on observables like depletion time and CO emission. The densest gas only constitutes
the tail of the density distribution of some clouds, but exists in large excess in others. The super-linearity
of the star formation rate dependence on gas density implies that this excess translates into a reduction
of depletion times, and thus leads to a deviation from the classical star formation regime, visible
up to galactic scales. These clouds are found in all parts of the galaxies, but their number density
varies from one region to the next, due to different cloud assembly mechanisms. Therefore, the dependence
of cloud and star formation-related quantities (like CO flux and depletion time) on the scale at
which they are measured also varies across the galaxies. We find that the $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ conversion
factor between the CO luminosity and molecular gas mass has even stronger spatial than temporal
variations in a system like the Antennae. These results raise a number of cautionary notes for the
interpretation of observations of unresolved star-forming regions, but also predict that the
diversity of environments for star formation will be better captured by the future generations
of instruments.
