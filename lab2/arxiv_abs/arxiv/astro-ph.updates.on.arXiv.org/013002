Phase mixing of Alfv\'en waves has been studied extensively as a possible coronal heating mechanism
but without the full thermodynamic consequences considered self-consistently. It has been argued
that in some cases, the thermodynamic feedback of the heating could substantially affect the transverse
density gradient and even inhibit the phase mixing process. In this paper, we use MHD simulations
with the appropriate thermodynamical terms included to quantify the evaporation following heating
by phase mixing of Alfv\'en waves in a coronal loop and the effect of this evaporation on the transverse
density profile. The numerical simulations were performed using the Lare2D code. We set up a 2D loop
model consisting of a field-aligned thermodynamic equilibrium and a cross-field (background)
heating profile. A continuous, sinusoidal, high-frequency Alfv\'en wave driver was implemented.
As the Alfv\'en waves propagate along the field, they undergo phase mixing due to the cross-field
density gradient in the coronal part of the loop. We investigated the presence of field-aligned
flows, heating from the dissipation of the phase-mixed Alfv\'en waves, and the subsequent evaporation
from the lower atmosphere. We find that phase mixing of Alfv\'en waves leads to modest heating in
the shell regions of the loop and evaporation of chromospheric material into the corona with upflows
of the order of only 5-20 m/s. Although the evaporation leads to a mass increase in the shell regions
of the loop, the effect on the density gradient and, hence, on the phase mixing process, is insignificant.
This paper self-consistently investigates the effect of chromospheric evaporation on the cross-field
density gradient and the phase mixing process in a coronal loop. We found that the effects in our particular
setup (small amplitude, high frequency waves) are too small to significantly change the density
gradient.
