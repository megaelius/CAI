We investigate whether magnetic interaction between close-in giant planets and their host stars
produce observable statistical enhancements in stellar coronal or chromospheric activity. New
Chandra observations of 12 nearby (d<60 pc) planet-hosting solar analogs are combined with
archival Chandra, XMM-Newton, and ROSAT coverage of 11 similar stars to construct a sample inoculated
against inherent stellar class and planet-detection biases. Survival analysis and Bayesian regression
methods (incorporating both measurements errors and X-ray upper limits; 13/23 stars have secure
detections) are used to test whether "hot Jupiter" hosts are systematically more X-ray luminous
than comparable stars with more distant or smaller planets. No significant correlations are present
between common proxies for interaction strength (Mp/a^2 or 1/a) versus coronal activity (Lx or
Lx/Lbol). In contrast, a sample of 198 FGK main-sequence stars does show a significant (~99% confidence)
increase in X-ray luminosity with Mp/a^2. While selection biases are incontrovertibly present
within the main-sequence sample, we demonstrate that the effect is primarily driven by a handful
of extreme hot-Jupiter systems with Mp/a^2 >450 Mjup/AU^2, which here are all X-ray luminous
but to a degree commensurate with their Ca II H and K activity, in contrast to presented magnetic star-planet
interaction scenarios that predict enhancements relatively larger in Lx. We discuss these results
in the context of cumulative tidal spin-up of stars hosting close-in gas giants (potentially followed
by planetary infall and destruction). We also test our main-sequence sample for correlations between
planetary properties and UV luminosity or Ca II H and K emission, and find no significant dependence.
