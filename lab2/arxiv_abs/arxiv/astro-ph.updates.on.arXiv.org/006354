Capella is a spectroscopic binary consisting of two G-type giants, where the primary (G8III) is
a normal red-clump giant while the secondary (G0III) is a chromospherically-active fast rotator
showing considerable overabundance of Li as Li-enhanced giants. Recently, Takeda & Tajitsu (2017)
reported that abundance ratios of specific light elements (e.g., [C/Fe] or [O/Fe]) in Li-rich giants
of high activity tend to be anomalously high, which they suspected to be nothing but superficial
caused by unusual atmospheric structure due to high activity. Towards verifying this hypothesis,
we determined the elemental abundances of the primary and the secondary of Capella based on the disentangled
spectrum of each component, in order to see whether any apparent disagreement exists between the
two, which should have been formed with the same chemical composition. We found that the primary
is slightly supersolar (by ~+0.1dex) while the secondary is subsolar (by several tenths dex) for
heavier elements such as Fe, resulting in a marked discrepancy between the primary and secondary,
though such a trend is not seen for light elements (e.g., C or O). These observational facts suggest
that anomalously large [X/Fe] ratios found in Li-rich giants were mainly due to an apparent decrease
of Fe abundance, which we speculate is caused by the overionization effect due to chromospheric
UV radiation. We thus conclude that conventional model atmosphere analysis would fail to correctly
determine the abundances of fast-rotating giants of high activity, for which proper treatment
of chromospheric effect is required for deriving true photospheric abundances.
