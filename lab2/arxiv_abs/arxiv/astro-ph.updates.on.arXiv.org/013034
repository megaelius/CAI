We have developed a new coherent dedispersion mode to study the emission of Fast Radio Bursts that
trigger the voltage capture capability of the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) interferometer.
In principle the mode can probe emission timescales down to 3 ns with full polarimetric information
preserved. Enabled by the new capability, here we present a spectropolarimetric analysis of FRB
181112 detected by ASKAP, localized to a galaxy at redshift 0.47. At microsecond time resolution
the burst is resolved into four narrow pulses with a rise time of just $15 \mu$s for the brightest.
The pulses have a diversity of morphology, but do not show evidence for temporal broadening by turbulent
plasma along the line of sight, nor is there any evidence for periodicity in their arrival times.
The pulses are highly polarized (up to 95%), with the polarization position angle varying both between
and within pulses. The pulses have apparent rotation measures that vary by $15\pm 2\, {\rm rad \,m^{-2}}$
and apparent dispersion measures that vary by $0.041\pm 0.004\,{\rm pc\,cm^{-3}}$. Conversion
between linear and circular polarization is observed across the brightest pulse. We conclude that
the FRB 181112 pulses are most consistent with being a direct manifestation of the emission process
or the result of propagation through a relativistic plasma close to the source. This demonstrates
that our method, which facilitates high-time-resolution polarimetric observations of FRBs,
can be used to study not only burst emission processes, but also a diversity of propagation effects
present on the gigaparsec paths they traverse.
