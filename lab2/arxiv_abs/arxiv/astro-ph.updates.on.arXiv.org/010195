Spectroscopic observations of the Seyfert 1/Liner nucleus of M81, obtained recently with the Space
Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), have revealed
a UV--visible spectrum rich with emission lines of a variety of widths, ionization potentials,
and critical densities, including several in the UV that have not previously been reported. Even
at the highest angular resolution currently achievable with HST, the broad-line region of M81 cannot
be uniquely defined on the basis of commonly used observables such as the full-width at half maximum
of the emission lines, or ratios of various emission lines. Numerous broad forbidden lines complicate
interpretation of the spectra. At least three separate line-emitting components are inferred.
A large, highly ionized, low density, low metallicity H${^+}$ region producing the broad Balmer
lines. Located within the H${^+}$ region are smaller condensations spanning a wide-range in density,
and the source of forbidden line emission through collisional excitation of the respective ions.
Intermingled with the H${^+}$ region and the condensations is a curious extended source of time-variable
CIV ${\lambda}$ 1548 emission. Collectively, these observations can be qualitatively understood
in the context of a shock excited jet cavity within a large H${^+}$ region that is photoionized by
the central UV--X-ray source. The H${^+}$ region contains ${\sim}$ 500 M${\odot}$ of low metallicity
gas that is dynamically unstable to inflow. At the current rate, the available H${^+}$ gas can sustain
the advection dominated accretion flow that powers the central UV--X-ray source for 10$^{5}$ years.
