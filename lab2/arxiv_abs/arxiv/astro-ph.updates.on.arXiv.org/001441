The theory of eternal inflation in an inflaton potential with multiple vacua predicts that our universe
is one of many bubble universes nucleating and growing inside an ever-expanding false vacuum. The
collision of our bubble with another could provide an important observational signature to test
this scenario. We develop and implement an algorithm for accurately computing the cosmological
observables arising from bubble collisions directly from the Lagrangian of a single scalar field.
We first simulate the collision spacetime by solving Einstein's equations, starting from nucleation
and ending at reheating. Taking advantage of the collision's hyperbolic symmetry, simulations
are performed with a 1+1-dimensional fully relativistic code that uses adaptive mesh refinement.
We then calculate the comoving curvature perturbation in an open Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
universe, which is used to determine the temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background
radiation. For a fiducial Lagrangian, the anisotropies are well described by a power law in the cosine
of the angular distance from the center of the collision signature. For a given form of the Lagrangian,
the resulting observational predictions are inherently statistical due to stochastic elements
of the bubble nucleation process. Further uncertainties arise due to our imperfect knowledge about
inflationary and pre-recombination physics. We characterize observational predictions by computing
the probability distributions over four phenomenological parameters which capture these intrinsic
and model uncertainties. This represents the first fully-relativistic set of predictions from
an ensemble of scalar field models giving rise to eternal inflation, yielding significant differences
from previous non-relativistic approximations. Thus, our results provide a basis for a rigorous
confrontation of these theories with cosmological data.
