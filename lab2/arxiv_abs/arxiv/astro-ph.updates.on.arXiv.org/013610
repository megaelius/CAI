We use hydrodynamical simulations to study the Milky Way's central molecular zone (CMZ), i.e. the
star-forming nuclear ring at Galactocentric radii $R\lesssim200$ pc. The simulations comprise
the gas flow in a Milky Way barred potential out to $R=5$ kpc, which is necessary in order to capture
the large-scale environment in which the CMZ is embedded and with which it is strongly interacting
through the bar-driven inflow. The simulations also include a non-equilibrium time-dependent
chemical network, gas self-gravity, and a sub-grid model for star formation and supernova feedback,
all while reaching sub-parsec resolution in the densest regions. Our main findings are as follows:
(1) The distinction between inner ($R\lesssim120$ pc) and outer ($120\lesssim R\lesssim450$
pc) CMZ that is sometimes proposed in the literature is unnecessary. Instead, the CMZ is best described
as single structure, namely a star-forming ring with outer radius $R\simeq 200$ pc which is interacting
directly with the dust lanes that mediate the bar-driven inflow. (2) This accretion can induce a
significant tilt of the CMZ out of the plane. A tilted CMZ might provide an alternative explanation
to the $\infty$-shaped structure identified in Herschel data by Molinari et al. 2011. (3) The bar
in our simulation efficiently drives an inflow from the Galactic disc ($R\simeq 3$ kpc) down to the
CMZ ($R\simeq200$ pc) of the order of $1\rm\,M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$, consistent with observational
determinations. (4) Self-gravity and supernovae feedback can drive an inflow from the CMZ inwards
towards the circumnuclear disc of the order of $\sim0.03\,\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$. (5) We give a
new interpretation for the 3D placement of the 20 and 50 km s$^{-1}$ clouds, according to which they
are close ($R\lesssim30$ pc) to the Galactic centre, but are also connected to the larger-scale
streams at $R\gtrsim100$ pc.
