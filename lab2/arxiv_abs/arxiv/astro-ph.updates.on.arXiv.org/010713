Recent studies show that the majority of blue straggler stars (BSSs) in old open clusters are formed
through mass transfer from an evolved star onto a main-sequence companion, resulting in a BSS and
white dwarf (WD) in a binary system. We present constraints on the mass transfer histories of two
BSS-WD binaries in the open cluster NGC 188, using WD temperatures and surface gravities measured
with HST COS far-ultraviolet spectroscopy. Adopting a Gaia-based cluster distance of $1847\pm107$
pc, we determine that one system, WOCS 4540, formed through Case C mass transfer resulting in a CO-core
white dwarf with $T_{\text{eff}}=17000^{+140}_{-200}$ K and a $\log g=7.80^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$,
corresponding to a mass of $0.53^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$ $M_{\odot}$ and a cooling age of $105^{+6}_{-5}$
Myr. The other system, WOCS 5379, formed through Case B mass transfer resulting in a He-core white
dwarf with $T_{\text{eff}}=15500^{+170}_{-150}$ K and a $\log g=7.50^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$, corresponding
to a mass of $0.42^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ $M_{\odot}$ and an age of $250^{+20}_{-20}$ Myr. The WD parameters
are consistent across four different cluster distance assumptions. We determine possible progenitor
binary systems with a grid of accretion models using MESA, and investigate whether these systems
would lead to stable or unstable mass transfer. WOCS 4540 likely resulted from stable mass transfer
during periastron passage in an eccentric binary system, while WOCS 5379 challenges our current
understanding of the expected outcomes for mass transfer from red giant branch stars. Both systems
are examples of the value in using detailed analyses to fine-tune our physical understanding of
binary evolutionary processes.
