Barium (Ba) dwarfs and CH subgiants are the less-evolved analogues of Ba and CH giants. They are F-
to G-type main-sequence stars polluted with heavy elements by a binary companion when the latter
was on the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). This companion is now a white dwarf that in most cases cannot
be directly detected. We present a large systematic study of 60 objects classified as Ba dwarfs or
CH subgiants. Combining radial-velocity measurements from HERMES and SALT high-resolution spectra
with radial-velocity data from CORAVEL and CORALIE, we determine the orbital parameters of 27 systems.
We also derive their masses by comparing their location in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with
evolutionary models. We confirm that Ba dwarfs and CH subgiants are not at different evolutionary
stages and have similar metallicities, despite their different names. Additionally, Ba giants
appear significantly more massive than their main-sequence analogues. This is likely due to observational
biases against the detection of hotter main-sequence post-mass-transfer objects. Combining
our spectroscopic orbits with the Hipparcos astrometric data, we derive the orbital inclinations
and the mass of the WD companion for four systems. Since this cannot be done for all systems in our sample
yet (but should be with upcoming Gaia data releases), we also analyse the mass-function distribution
of our binaries. We can model this distribution with very narrow mass distributions for the two components
and random orbital orientation on the sky. Finally, based on BINSTAR evolutionary models, we suggest
that the orbital evolution of low-mass Ba systems can be affected by a second phase of interaction
along the Red Giant Branch of the Ba star, impacting on the eccentricities and periods of the giants.
