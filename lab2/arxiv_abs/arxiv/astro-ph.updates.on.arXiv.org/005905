We recently used hydro-chemical simulations to demonstrate that molecular outflows observed
in luminous quasars can be explained by molecule formation within the AGN wind. However, these simulations
cover a limited parameter space, due to their computational cost. We have therefore developed an
analytic model to follow cooling in the shocked ISM layer of an AGN wind. We explore different ambient
densities ($1-10^{4} \, \rm{cm}^{-3}$), density profile slopes ($0-1.5$), AGN luminosities
($10^{44}-10^{47} \, \rm{erg} \, \rm{s}^{-1}$), and metallicities ($0.1-3 \rm{Z}_{\odot}$).
The swept up gas mostly cools within ~1 Myr. Based on our previous simulations, we predict that this
gas would produce observable molecular outflows. The instantaneous momentum boost initially
increases as the outflow decelerates. However, it reaches a maximum of $\approx$20, due to work
done against the gravitational potential. The predicted time-averaged observational estimate
of the molecular outflow momentum boost reaches a maximum of $\approx1-2$, partly due to our assumed
molecular fraction, 0.2, but also because the instantaneous and observational, time-averaged
definitions are not equivalent. Thus recent observational estimates of order unity momentum boosts
do not necessarily rule out energy-driven outflows. Finally, we find that dust grains are likely
to re-form by accretion of metals after the shocked ISM layer has cooled, assuming that a small fraction
of dust grains swept up after this layer has cooled are able to mix into the cool phase, and assuming
that grain growth remains efficient in the presence of the strong AGN radiation field. This would
enable rapid molecule formation, as assumed in our models.
