Spatial distribution and growth of dust in a clumpy protoplanetary disk subject to vigorous gravitational
instability and fragmentation is studied numerically with sub-au resolution using the FEOSAD
code. Hydrodynamics equations describing the evolution of self-gravitating and viscous protoplanetary
disks in the thin-disk limit were modified to include a dust component consisting of two parts: sub-micron-sized
dust and grown dust with a variable maximum radius. The conversion of small to grown dust, dust growth,
friction of dust with gas, and dust self-gravity were also considered. We found that the disk appearance
is notably time-variable with spiral arms, dusty rings, and clumps, constantly forming, evolving,
and decaying. As a consequence, the total dust-to-gas mass ratio is highly non-homogeneous throughout
the disk extent, showing order-of-magnitude local deviations from the canonical 1:100 value.
Gravitationally bound clumps formed through gravitational fragmentation have a velocity pattern
that deviates notably from the Keplerian rotation. Small dust is efficiently converted into grown
dust in the clump interiors, reaching a maximum radius of several decimeters. Concurrently, grown
dust drifts towards the clump center forming a massive compact central condensation (70-100 $M_\oplus$).
We argue that protoplanets may form in the interiors of inward migrating clumps before they disperse
through the action of tidal torques. We foresee the formation of protoplanets at orbital distances
of several tens of au with initial masses of gas and dust in the protoplanetary seed in the (0.25-1.6)
$M_{\rm Jup}$ and (1.0-5.5) $M_\oplus$ limits, respectively. The final masses of gas and dust in
the protoplanets may however be much higher due to accretion from surrounding massive metal-rich
disks/envelopes.
