We have obtained structural parameters of about 340,000 galaxies from the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS)
in 153 square degrees of data release 1, 2 and 3. We have performed a seeing convolved 2D single S\'ersic
fit to the galaxy images in the 4 photometric bands (u, g, r, i) observed by KiDS, by selecting high
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N > 50) systems in every bands. We have classified galaxies as spheroids
and disc-dominated by combining their spectral energy distribution properties and their S\'ersic
index. Using photometric redshifts derived from a machine learning technique, we have determined
the evolution of the effective radius, \Re\ and stellar mass, \mst, versus redshift, for both mass
complete samples of spheroids and disc-dominated galaxies up to z ~ 0.6. Our results show a significant
evolution of the structural quantities at intermediate redshift for the massive spheroids ($\mbox{Log}\
M_*/M_\odot>11$, Chabrier IMF), while almost no evolution has found for less massive ones ($\mbox{Log}\
M_*/M_\odot < 11$). On the other hand, disc dominated systems show a milder evolution in the less
massive systems ($\mbox{Log}\ M_*/M_\odot < 11$) and possibly no evolution of the more massive
systems. These trends are generally consistent with predictions from hydrodynamical simulations
and independent datasets out to redshift z ~ 0.6, although in some cases the scatter of the data is
large to drive final conclusions. These results, based on 1/10 of the expected KiDS area, reinforce
precedent finding based on smaller statistical samples and show the route toward more accurate
results, expected with the the next survey releases.
