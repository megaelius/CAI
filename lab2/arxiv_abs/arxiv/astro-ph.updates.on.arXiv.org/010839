Extracting the temperature of coronal loops is effective in the analysis of solar active region's
loops and helps in better understanding of coronal events. To this end, various methods have already
been developed like the method developed by Aschwanden et al. 2015 \cite{AschwandenB2015} which
is based on Gaussian fit for Differential Emission Measure (DEM). Here, we use the intensity ratios
of the images in three different wavelengths and the temperature response functions of AIA to extract
the temperature of the loop. In this paper, we use EUV images of the solar active region 11092 taken
by AIA instrument of the SDO satellite at 171, 193, and 211 $A^{0}$ wavelengths, at 1th of August,
2010. We select a loop in a subregion of 11092 and extract its temperature by the help of intensity
profiles in different wavelengths and thermal response functions of different filters. In this
subregion cooling of the loop happens and in the selected loop, highest relative intensity of the
wavelengths of 171 $A^{0}$ to 193 $A^{0}$ was obtained to be $0.76$ and this number was estimated
to correspond to the temperature of 1.3 million degree of Kelvin, which is the maximum temperature
point of this loop's internal area. The highest values of the intensity ratios at the wavelengths
of 211$A^{0}$ to 193$A^{0}$, and 211$A^{0}$ to 171$A^{0}$ are $0.22$ and $0.25$, which correspond
to temperature values around 10M and 1.4M Kelvin in sequence, related to the temperature of hotter
and more superficial points of the loop respectively. These values are very sensitive to time and
differ in time series of this event of the loop intensity variation.
