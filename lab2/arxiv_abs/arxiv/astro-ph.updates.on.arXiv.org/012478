Context: Lyman $\alpha$ blobs (LABs) are large-scale radio-quiet Lyman $\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$)
nebula at high-$z$ that occur predominantly in overdense proto-cluster regions. Especially the
prototypical SSA22a-LAB1 at $z=3.1$ has become an observational reference for LABs across the
electromagnetic spectrum. Aims: We want to understand the powering mechanisms that drive the LAB
to gain empirical insights into galaxy formation processes within a rare dense environment at high-$z$.
Methods: LAB 1 was observed for 17.5h with the VLT/MUSE integral-field spectrograph. We produced
optimally extracted narrow band images in Ly$\alpha$ $\lambda1216$, HeII $\lambda1640$, and
we tried to detect CIV $\lambda1549$ emission. By using a moment based analysis we mapped the kinematics
of the blob. Results: We detect Ly$\alpha$ emission to surface-brightness limits of $10^{-19}$erg
s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$arcsec$^{-2}$. At this depth we reveal a bridge between LAB 1 and its northern
neighbour LAB 8, as well as a shell-like filament towards the south of LAB 1. We find a coherent large
scale east-west $\sim$1000 km s$^{-1}$ velocity gradient that is aligned perpendicular to the
major axis of the blob. We detect HeII emission in three distinct regions, but we can only provide
upper limits for CIV. Conclusions: Various gas excitation mechanisms are at play in LAB 1: Ionising
radiation and feedback effects dominate near the embedded galaxies, while Ly$\alpha$ scattering
is contributing at larger distances. The HeII/Ly$\alpha$ ratios combined with the upper limits
on CIV/Ly$\alpha$ ratios favour shock models over photo-ionisation. The alignment of the angular
momentum vector parallel to the morphological principal axis appears odds with the predicted norm
for high-mass halos, but likely reflects that LAB\,1 resides at a node of multiple intersecting
filaments of the cosmic web. (Abridged)
