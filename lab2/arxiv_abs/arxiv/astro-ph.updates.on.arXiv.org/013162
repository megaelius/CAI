We study the atomic gas content and the central stellar mass concentration for a sample of almost
1500 nearby galaxies to investigate the nature of starbursts and the influence of galaxy-galaxy
interactions on star formation (SF). We used a sample of catalogued interacting and non-interacting
galaxies in the S$^4$G survey - along with archival HI gas masses, stellar masses ($M_{\ast}$),
and SF rates from $IRAS$ far-infrared fluxes - and calculate depletion times and gas fractions.
We traced the central stellar mass concentration from the inner slope of the stellar component of
the rotation curves. Starbursts are defined as galaxies with a factor $>4$ enhanced SF rate relative
to a control sample of non-interacting galaxies which are $\pm 0.2$ dex in stellar mass and $\pm 1$
in $T$-type. Starbursts are mainly early-type ($T\lesssim 5$), massive spiral galaxies ($M_{\ast}\gtrsim
10^{10}M_{\odot}$) that are not necessarily interacting. For a given stellar mass bin, starbursts
are characterised by lower gas depletion times, similar gas fractions, and larger central stellar
mass concentrations than non-starburst galaxies. The global distributions of gas fraction and
gas depletion time are not statistically different for interacting and non-interacting galaxies.
However, in the case of currently merging galaxies, the median gas depletion time is a factor of $0.4
\pm 0.2$ that of control sample galaxies, and their SF rates are a factor of $1.9 \pm 0.5$ enhanced,
even though the median gas fraction is similar. Starbursts present long-lasting SF in the circumnuclear
regions that causes an enhancement of the central stellar density at $z\approx0$ in both interacting
and non-interacting systems. Starbursts have low gas depletion timescales, yet similar gas fractions
as normal main-sequence galaxies. Galaxy mergers cause a moderate enhancement of the SF efficiency
(Abridged).
