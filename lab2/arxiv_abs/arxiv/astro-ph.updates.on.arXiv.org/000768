We characterize the completeness of point source lists from Spitzer Space Telescope surveys in
the four Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) bandpasses, emphasizing the Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane
Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE) programs (GLIMPSE I, II, 3D, 360; Deep GLIMPSE) and their resulting
point source Catalogs and Archives. The analysis separately addresses effects of incompleteness
resulting from high diffuse background emission and incompleteness resulting from point source
confusion (i.e., crowding). An artificial star addition and extraction analysis demonstrates
that completeness is strongly dependent on local background brightness and structure, with high-surface-brightness
regions suffering up to five magnitudes of reduced sensitivity to point sources. This effect is
most pronounced at the IRAC 5.8 and 8.0 microns bands where UV-excited PAH emission produces bright,
complex structures (photodissociation regions; PDRs). With regard to diffuse background effects,
we provide the completeness as a function of stellar magnitude and diffuse background level in graphical
and tabular formats. These data are suitable for estimating completeness in the low-source-density
limit in any of the four IRAC bands in GLIMPSE Catalogs and Archives and some other Spitzer IRAC programs
that employ similar observational strategies and are processed by the GLIMPSE pipeline. Point
source incompleteness is primarily a consequence of structure in the diffuse background emission
rather than photon noise. With regard to source confusion in the high-source-density regions of
the Galactic Plane, we provide figures illustrating the 90% completeness levels as a function of
point source density at each band. (Slightly abridged)
