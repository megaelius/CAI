Understanding the complex behavior of High Mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) is not possible without
detailed information about their donor stars. While crucial, this turns out to be a challenge on
multiple fronts. First, multi-wavelength spectroscopy is vital. As such systems can be highly
absorbed, this is often already hard to accomplish. Secondly, even if the spectroscopic data is
available, the determination of reliable stellar parameters requires sophisticated model atmospheres
that accurately describe the outermost layers and the wind of the donor star. For early-type donors,
the stellar wind is radiatively driven and there is a smooth transition between the outermost layers
of the star and the wind. The intricate non-LTE conditions in the winds of hot stars complicate the
situation even further, as proper model atmospheres need to account for a multitude of physics to
accurately provide stellar and wind parameters. The latter are especially crucial for the so-called
"wind-fed" HXMBs, where the captured wind of the supergiant donor is the only source for the material
accreted by the compact object. In this review I will address the different approaches for treating
stellar winds in the analysis of HMXBs. Fundamentals of stellar atmosphere modeling are discussed,
also addressing the limitations of modern models and examples from recent analysis results for
particular HMXBs. Moreover, the path for the next generation of stellar atmosphere models will
be outlined, where models can be used not only for measurements, but also to make predictions and
provide a laboratory for theoretical conclusions. Stellar atmospheres are a key tool in understanding
HMXBs, e.g. by providing insights about the accretion of stellar winds onto the compact object,
or by placing the studied systems in the correct evolutionary context in order to identify potential
gravitational wave (GW) progenitors.
