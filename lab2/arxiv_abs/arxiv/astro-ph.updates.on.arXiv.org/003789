The fraction of galaxies bound in groups in the nearby Universe is high (50% at z~0). Systematic studies
of galaxy properties in groups are important in order to improve our understanding of the evolution
of galaxies and of the physical phenomena occurring within this environment. We have built a complete
spectrophotometric sample of galaxies within X-ray detected, optically spectroscopically confirmed
groups and clusters (G&C), covering a wide range of halo masses at z<= 0.6. In the context of the XXL
survey, we analyse a sample of 164 G&C in the XXL-North region (XXL-N), at z <= 0.6, with a wide range
of virial masses (1.24 x 10^13 <=M_500 M_sun <= 6.63 x 10^14) and X-ray luminosities ( 2.27 x 10^41
<= L^XXL_500 (erg/s)<= 2.15 x10^44). The G&C are X-ray selected and spectroscopically confirmed.
We describe the membership assignment and the spectroscopic completeness analysis, and compute
stellar masses. As a first scientific exploitation of the sample, we study the dependence of the
galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) on global environment. We present a spectrophotometric characterisation
of the G&C and their galaxies. The final sample contains 132 G&C, 22111 field galaxies and 2225 G&C
galaxies with r-band magnitude <20. Of the G&C, 95% have at least three spectroscopic members, and
70% at least ten. The shape of the GSMF seems not to depend on environment (field versus G&C) or X-ray
luminosity ( used as a proxy for the virial mass of the system). These results are confirmed by the
study of the correlation between mean stellar mass of G&C members and L^XXL_500.We release the spectrophotometric
catalogue of galaxies with all the quantities computed in this work. As a first homogeneous census
of galaxies within X-ray spectroscopically confirmed G&C at these redshifts, this sample will
allow environmental studies of the evolution of galaxy properties.
