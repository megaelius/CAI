We present a novel method of robust probabilistic cosmic web particle classification in three dimensions
using a supervised machine learning algorithm. Training data was generated using a simplified
$\Lambda$CDM toy model with pre-determined algorithms for generating halos, filaments, and voids.
While this model lacks physical detail, it can be generated substantially more quickly than an N-body
simulation without loss in classification accuracy. For each particle in this dataset, measurements
were taken of the local density field and directionality. These measurements were used to train
a random forest algorithm with, which was used to assign class probabilities to each particle in
a $\Lambda$CDM, dark matter-only N-body simulation with $256^3$ particles, as well as on another
toy model data set. By comparing the trends in the ROC curves and other statistical metrics of predictions
made on each of the datasets using different feature sets, we demonstrate that the combination of
measurements of the local density field magnitude and directionality enables accurate and consistent
classification of halo, filament, and void particles in varied environments. We also show that
this combination of training features ensures that the construction of our toy model does not affect
classification. The use of a fully supervised algorithm allows greater control over the information
deemed important for classification, preventing issues arising from hyperparameters and mode
collapse in deep learning models. Due to the speed of training data generation, our method is highly
scalable, making it particularly suited for classifying large datasets, including observed data.
