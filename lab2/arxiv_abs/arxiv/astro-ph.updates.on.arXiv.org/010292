We investigate correlated gravitational wave and neutrino signals from rotating core-collapse
supernovae with simulations. Using an improved mode identification procedure based on mode function
matching, we show that a linear quadrupolar mode of the core produces a dual imprint on gravitational
waves and neutrinos in the early post-bounce phase of the supernova. The angular harmonics of the
neutrino emission are consistent with the mode energy around the neutrinospheres, which points
to a mechanism for the imprint on neutrinos. Thus, neutrinos carry information about the mode amplitude
in the outer region of the core, whereas gravitational waves probe deeper in. We also find that the
best-fit mode function has a frequency bounded above by $\sim 280$ Hz, and yet the mode's frequency
in our simulations is almost double, due to the use of Newtonian hydrodynamics and a widely used pseudo-Newtonian
gravity approximation. This overestimation is particularly important for the analysis of gravitational
wave detectability and asteroseismology, pointing to serious limitations of pseudo-Newtonian
approaches for these purposes, possibly even resulting in excitation of incorrect modes. In addition,
mode frequency matching (as opposed to mode function matching) could be resulting in mode misidentification
in recent work. Lastly, we evaluate the prospects of a multimessenger detection of the mode using
current technology. The detection of the imprint on neutrinos is most challenging, with a maximum
detection distance of $\sim\!1$ kpc using the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The maximum distance
for detecting the complementary gravitational wave imprint is $\sim\!5$ kpc using Advanced LIGO
at design sensitivity.
