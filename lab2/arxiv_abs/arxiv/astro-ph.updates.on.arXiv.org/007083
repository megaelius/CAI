Context: It has been suggested that some supernovae (SNe) may be powered by a magnetar formed at the
moment of the explosion. While this scenario has mostly been applied to hydrogen-free events, it
may be possible also for hydrogen-rich objects. Aims: We explore the effect of including a magnetar
on the light curves of supernovae with H-rich progenitors. Methods: We have applied a version of
our one-dimensional LTE radiation hydrodynamics code that takes into account the relativistic
motion of the ejecta caused by the extra energy provided by the magnetar. For a fixed red supergiant
(RSG) progenitor, we have obtained a set of light curves that corresponds to different values of
the magnetar initial rotation energy and the spin-down timescale. The model is applied to SN~2004em
and OGLE-2014-SN-073, two peculiar Type II SNe with long-rising SN1987A-like light curves, although
with much larger luminosities. Results: The presence of a plateau phase in either normal or superluminous
supernovae is one possible outcome, even if a magnetar is continuously injecting energy into the
ejecta.In other cases, the light curve shows a peak but not a plateau. Also, there are intermediate
events with a first peak followed by a slow decline and a late break of the declining slope. Our models
show that bright and long rising morphologies are possible even assuming RSG structures. Conclusions:
A large number of supernova discoveries per year reveal unexpected new types of explosions. According
to our results, SLSNe II-P are to be expected, as well as a variety of light curve morphologies that
can all be possible signs of a newly born magnetar.
