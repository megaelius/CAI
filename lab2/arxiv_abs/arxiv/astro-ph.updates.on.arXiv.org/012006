The state-of-the-art geometry models of star/dust suggest that dust attenuation toward nebular
regions ($A_{V,gas}$) is always larger than that of stellar regions ($A_{V,star}$). Utilizing
the newly released Integral Field Spectroscopic data from the MaNGA survey, we investigate whether
and how the $A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$ ratio varies from subgalactic to galactic scales. On subgalactic
scale, we report stronger correlation between $A_{V,star}$ and $A_{V,gas}$ for more active HII
regions. The local $A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$ is found to have moderate non-linear correlations
with three tracers of diffuse ionized gas (DIG) as well as indicators of gas-phase metallicity and
ionization. DIG regions tend to have larger $A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$ compared to classic HII regions
excited by young OB stars. Metal-poor regions with higher ionized level suffer much less nebular
attenuation and thus have larger $A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$ ratios. A low-$A_{V,gas}$ and high-$A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$
sequence, which can be resolved into DIG-dominated and metal-poor regions, on the three BPT diagrams
is found. Based on these observations, we suggest that besides geometry of star/dust, local physical
conditions such as metallicity and ionized level also play an important role in determining the
$A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$. On galactic scale, the global $A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$ ratio has strong
correlation with stellar mass, moderate correlations with SFR and metallicity, and weak correlations
with inclination and sSFR. Galaxies with larger $M_*$, higher SFR, and being more metal-rich tend
to have smaller $A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$ ratios. Such correlations form a decreasing trend of $A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$
along the star-forming main sequence and mass-metallicity relation. The dust growth process accompanied
with galaxy growth might be one plausible explanation of our observations.
