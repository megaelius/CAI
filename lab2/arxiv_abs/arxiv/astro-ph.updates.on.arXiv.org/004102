The recent discovery by Pan-STARRS1 of 1I/2017 U1 (`Oumuamua), on an unbound and hyperbolic orbit,
offers a rare opportunity to explore the planetary formation processes of other stars, and the effect
of the interstellar environment on a planetesimal surface. 1I/`Oumuamua's close encounter with
the inner Solar System in 2017 October was a unique chance to make observations matching those used
to characterize the small-body populations of our own Solar System. We present near-simultaneous
g$^\prime$, r$^\prime$, and J photometry and colors of 1I/`Oumuamua from the 8.1-m Frederick C.
Gillett Gemini North Telescope, and $gri$ photometry from the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope.
Our g$^\prime$r$^\prime$J observations are directly comparable to those from the high-precision
\textit{Colours of the Outer Solar System Origins Survey} (Col-OSSOS), and offer unique diagnostic
information for distinguishing between outer Solar System surfaces. Substantial, correlated
near-infrared and optical variability is present, with the same trend in both near-infrared and
optical. Our observations confirm that 1I/`Oumuamua rotates with a double-peaked period of $8.10
\pm 0.42$ hours and is a highly elongated body with an axial ratio of at least 5.3:1, implying that
it has significant internal cohesion. 1I/`Oumuamua's color is at the neutral end of the range of
observed $g-r$ and $r-J$ solar-reflectance colors, relative to asteroids, more distant minor
planets, and to the trans-Neptunian populations measured by Col-OSSOS. The color of the first interstellar
planetesimal is like the colors of the Solar System, in particular some of the dynamically excited
objects of the Kuiper belt and the less-red Jupiter Trojans.
