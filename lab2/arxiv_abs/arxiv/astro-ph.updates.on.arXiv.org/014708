Context: The Faraday rotation measure (RM) is often used to study the magnetic field strength and
orientation within the ionized medium of the Milky Way. Observations indicate a RM in the spiral
arms that exceeds the commonly assumed range. This raises the question of under what conditions
spiral arms create such strong RM. Aims: We investigate the effect of spiral arms on Galactic RMs
through shock compression of the interstellar medium (ISM). It has recently been suggested that
the Sagittarius spiral arm creates a strong peak in RM where the line of sight (LOS) is tangent to the
arm, and that enhanced RM follows along an intersecting LOS. We seek to understand the physical conditions
that give rise to this effect and the role of viewing geometry. Methods: We apply a MHD simulation
of the multi-phase ISM in a Milky Way type spiral galaxy disk in combination with radiative transfer
to evaluate different tracers of spiral arm structures. For observers embedded in the disk, dust
intensity, synchrotron emission and the kinematics of molecular gas observations are derived
to identify spiral arm tangents. RMs are calculated through the disk and evaluated for different
observer positions. The observer's perspective is related to the parameters of the local bubble
surrounding the observer. Results: We reproduce a scattering of tangent points for different tracers
of about $6^\circ$ per spiral arm similar to the Milky Way. As for the RM, the model shows that compression
of the ISM and associated amplification of the magnetic field in spiral arms enhances RM by a few hundred
rad $m^{-2}$ on top of the mean contribution of the disk. The arm-inter-arm contrast in RM along the
LOS is approximately 10 in the inner Galaxy, fading to ~2 in the outer Galaxy. We identify a shark-fin
like pattern in the RM Milky Way observations as well as the synthetic data that is characteristic
for spiral arms.
