We report the discovery of a transiting, Rp = 4.347+/-0.099REarth, circumbinary planet (CBP) orbiting
the Kepler K+M Eclipsing Binary (EB) system KIC 12351927 (Kepler-413) every ~66 days on an eccentric
orbit with ap = 0.355+/-0.002AU, ep = 0.118+/-0.002. The two stars, with MA = 0.820+/-0.015MSun,
RA = 0.776+/-0.009RSun and MB = 0.542+/-0.008MSun, RB = 0.484+/-0.024RSun respectively revolve
around each other every 10.11615+/-0.00001 days on a nearly circular (eEB = 0.037+/-0.002) orbit.
The orbital plane of the EB is slightly inclined to the line of sight (iEB = 87.33+/-0.06 degrees)
while that of the planet is inclined by ~2.5 degrees to the binary plane at the reference epoch. Orbital
precession with a period of ~11 years causes the inclination of the latter to the sky plane to continuously
change. As a result, the planet often fails to transit the primary star at inferior conjunction,
causing stretches of hundreds of days with no transits (corresponding to multiple planetary orbital
periods). We predict that the next transit will not occur until 2020. The orbital configuration
of the system places the planet slightly closer to its host stars than the inner edge of the extended
habitable zone. Additionally, the orbital configuration of the system is such that the CBP may experience
Cassini-States dynamics under the influence of the EB, in which the planet's obliquity precesses
with a rate comparable to its orbital precession. Depending on the angular precession frequency
of the CBP, it could potentially undergo obliquity fluctuations of dozens of degrees (and complex
seasonal cycles) on precession timescales.
