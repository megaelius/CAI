Besides the fact that the gamma-ray emission due to radioactive decays is responsible for powering
the light curves of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), gamma rays themselves are of particular interest
as a diagnostic tool because they provide a direct way to obtain deeper insights into the nucleosynthesis
and the kinematics of these explosion events. Focusing on two of the most broadly discussed SN Ia
progenitor scenarios - a delayed detonation in a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf (WD) and a violent
merger of two WDs - we use three-dimensional explosion models and perform radiative transfer simulations
to obtain synthetic gamma-ray spectra. Both chosen models produce the same mass of 56Ni and have
similar optical properties that are in reasonable agreement with the recently observed supernova
SN 2011fe. In contrast to the optical regime, the gamma-ray emission of our two chosen models proves
to be rather different. The almost direct connection of the emission of gamma rays to fundamental
physical processes occuring in SNe Ia permits additional constraints concerning several explosion
model properties that are not easily accessible within other wavelength ranges. Proposed future
MeV missions such as GRIPS will resolve all spectral details only for nearby SNe Ia, but hardness
ratio and light curve measurements still allow for a distinction of the two different models at 10
and 16 Mpc for an exposure time of 10^6 s, respectively. The possibility to detect the strongest line
features up to the Virgo distance will offer the opportunity to build up a first sample of SN Ia detections
in the gamma-ray energy range and underlines the importance of future space observatories for MeV
gamma rays.
