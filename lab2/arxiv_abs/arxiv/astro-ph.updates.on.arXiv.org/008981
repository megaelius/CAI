The extent of the gas in protoplanetary disks is observed to be universally larger than the extent
of the dust. This is often attributed to radial drift and grain growth of the mm grains, but line optical
depth produces a similar observational signature. We investigate in what parts of the disk structure
parameter space dust evolution and line optical depth are the dominant drivers of the observed gas
and dust size difference. Using the thermochemical model DALI with dust evolution included we ran
a grid of models aimed at reproducing the observed gas and dust size dichotomy. The relation between
R_dust and dust evolution is non-monotonic and depends on the disk structure. R_gas is directly
related to the radius where the CO column density drops below 10^15 cm^-2 and CO becomes photodissociated.
R_gas is not affected by dust evolution but scales with the total CO content of the disk. R_gas/R_dust
> 4 is a clear sign for dust evolution and radial drift in disks, but these cases are rare in current
observations. For disks with a smaller R_gas/R_dust, identifying dust evolution from R_gas/R_dust
requires modelling the disk structure including the total CO content. To minimize the uncertainties
due to observational factors requires FWHM_beam < 1x the characteristic radius and a peak SNR > 10
on the 12CO emission moment zero map. For the dust outer radius to enclose most of the disk mass, it
should be defined using a high fraction (90-95%) of the total flux. For the gas, any radius enclosing
> 60% of the 12CO flux will contain most of the disk mass. To distinguish radial drift and grain growth
from line optical depth effects based on size ratios requires disks to be observed at high enough
angular resolution and the disk structure should to be modelled to account for the total CO content
of the disk.
