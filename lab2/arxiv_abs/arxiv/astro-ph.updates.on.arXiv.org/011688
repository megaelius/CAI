The recently published fourth Fermi Large Area Telescope source catalog (4FGL) reports 5065 gamma-ray
sources in terms of direct observational gamma-ray properties. Among the sources, the largest
population is the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), which consists of 3137 blazars, 42 radio galaxies,
and 28 other AGNs. The blazar sample comprises 694 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), 1131 BL
Lac-type objects (BL Lacs), and 1312 blazar candidates of an unknown type (BCUs). The classification
of blazars is difficult using optical spectroscopy given the limited knowledge with respect to
their intrinsic properties, and the limited availability of astronomical observations. To overcome
these challenges, machine learning algorithms are being investigated as alternative approaches.
Using the 4FGL catalog, a sample of 3137 Fermi blazars with 23 parameters is systematically selected.
Three established supervised machine learning algorithms (random forests (RFs), support vector
machines (SVMs), artificial neural networks (ANNs)) are employed to general predictive models
to classify the BCUs. We analyze the results for all of the different combinations of parameters.
Interestingly, a previously reported trend the use of more parameters leading to higher accuracy
is not found. Considering the least number of parameters used, combinations of eight, 12 or 10 parameters
in the SVM, ANN, or RF generated models achieve the highest accuracy (Accuracy $\simeq$ 91.8\%,
or $\simeq$ 92.9\%). Using the combined classification results from the optimal combinations
of parameters, 724 BL Lac type candidates and 332 FSRQ type candidates are predicted; however, 256
remain without a clear prediction.
