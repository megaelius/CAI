We take advantage of the capabilities of the OTELO survey to select and study the AGN population in
the field. We performed an analysis of the properties of these objects, including their demography,
morphology, and IR luminosity. Focusing on the population of H$\alpha$ emitters at $z \sim 0.4$,
we also aim to study the environments of AGN and non-AGN galaxies at that redshift. We make use of the
multiwavelength catalog of objects in the field compiled by the OTELO survey, unique in terms of
minimum line flux and equivalent width. The OTELO pseudo-spectra allow the identification of emission
lines and the spectral classification of the sources. We obtained a sample of 72 AGNs in the field
of OTELO, selected with four different methods in the optical, X-rays, and mid-infrared bands.
We find that using X-rays is the most efficient way to select AGNs. An analysis was performed on the
AGN population of OTELO in order to characterize its members. At $z \sim 0.4$, we find that up to 26\%
of our H$\alpha$ emitters are AGNs. At that redshift, AGNs are found in identical environments to
non-AGNs, although they represent the most clustered group when compared to passive and star-forming
galaxies. The majority of our AGNs at any redshift were classified as late-type galaxies, including
a 16\% proportion of irregulars. Another 16\% of AGNs show signs of interactions or mergers. Regarding
the infrared luminosity, we are able to recover all the luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) in the
field of OTELO up to $z\sim 1.6$. We find that the proportion of LIRGs and ultra-luminous infrared
galaxies (ULIRGs) is higher among the AGN population, and that ULIRGs show a higher fraction of AGNs
than LIRGs.
