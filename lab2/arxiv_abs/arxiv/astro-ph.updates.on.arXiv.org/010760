Solar active regions contain electric currents. Information on the distribution of currents is
important for understanding the processes of energy release on the surface of the Sun and in the overlying
layers. The paper presents an analysis of the probability density function (PDF) of the absolute
value of the photospheric vertical electric current density ($|j_z|$) in 48 active regions before
and after flares in 2010--2017. Calculation of $|j_z|$ is performed by applying the differential
form of Ampere's circuital law to photospheric vector magnetograms obtained from observations
of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO). It has been established that for the studied active regions PDF($|j_z|$) is described by
the Gauss function in the low-$|j_z|$ region ($|j_z| < 10110 \pm 1321$ statampere/cm$^2$) and the
decaying power-law function in the region of higher $|j_z|$ values. Also, for some active regions
PDF($|j_z|$) can be described by the special kappa-function. The distributions of the parameters
of the approximating functions are obtained using the least squares method. The average absolute
value of the power-law function index is $3.69 \pm 0.51$, and $3.99 \pm 0.51$ of the kappa-function.
No systematic changes in parameters during the flares are detected. An explicit connection between
the parameters and the flare X-ray class, as well as with the Hale magnetic class of the active regions,
is not found. Arguments are presented in favor of the suggestion that the Gaussian distribution
in the low-value region of PDF($|j_z|$) represents noise in the data, while the power-law "tail"
reflects the nature of electric currents in the solar active regions.
