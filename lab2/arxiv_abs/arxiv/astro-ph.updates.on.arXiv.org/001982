We study corrections to the power spectra of curvature and tensor perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar
ratio in single field slow roll inflation due to initial conditions imprinted by a fast-roll stage
prior to slow roll. For a wide range of initial inflaton kinetic energy, this stage lasts only a few
e-folds and merges smoothly with slow-roll leading to non-Bunch-Davies initial conditions for
modes that exit the Hubble radius during slow roll. We describe a program that yields the dynamics
in the fast-roll stage while matching to the slow roll stage independent of the inflationary potentials.
Corrections to the power spectra are encoded in a transfer function $\mathcal{T}_\alpha(k)$.
We obtain $\mathcal{T}_\alpha(k)$ to leading order in a Born approximation valid for modes of observational
relevance today. A fit yields $\mathcal{T}_\alpha(k) =1+ A_{\alpha}k^{-p}\cos[2\pi \omega
k/H_{sr}+\varphi_\alpha]$, with $1.5 \lesssim p \lesssim 2$, $\omega \simeq 1$ and $H_{sr}$ the
Hubble scale during slow roll inflation, where curvature and tensor perturbations feature the
same $p,\omega$ for a wide range of initial conditions. These corrections lead to both a suppression
of the quadrupole and oscillatory features in both $P_R(k)$ and $r(k_0)$ with a period of the order
of the Hubble scale during slow roll inflation. The results are independent of the specific inflationary
potentials, depending solely on the ratio of kinetic to potential energy $\kappa$ and the slow roll
parameters to leading order. For a wide range of $\kappa$ and the values of $\epsilon_V;\eta_V$
corresponding to the upper bounds from Planck, we find that the low quadrupole is consistent with
the results from Planck, and the oscillations in $r(k_0)$ could be observable if the modes corresponding
to the quadrupole and the pivot scale crossed the Hubble radius a few e-folds after the onset of slow
roll.
