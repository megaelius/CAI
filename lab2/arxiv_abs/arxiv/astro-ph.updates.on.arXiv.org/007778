Prompted by the H I Ly$\alpha$ absorption associated with the X-ray ultra-fast outflow at -17,300
$\rm km~s^{-1}$ in the quasar PG~1211+143, we have searched archival UV spectra at the expected
locations of H I Ly$\alpha$ absorption for a large sample of ultra-fast outflows identified in XMM-Newton
and Suzaku observations. Sixteen of the X-ray outflows have predicted H I Ly$\alpha$ wavelengths
falling within the bandpass of spectra from either the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer
or the Hubble Space Telescope, although none of the archival observations were simultaneous with
the X-ray observations in which UFOs were detected. In our spectra broad features with full-width
at half-maximum of 1000 $\rm km~s^{-1}$ have 2-$\sigma$ upper limits on the H I column density of
generally <$2\times10^{13}~\rm cm^{-2}$. Using grids of photoionization models covering a broad
range of spectral energy distributions, we find that producing Fe XXVI Ly$\alpha$ X-ray absorption
with equivalent widths $>30$ eV and associated H I Ly$\alpha$ absorption with $\rm N_{HI}<2\times10^{13}~cm^{-2}$
requires total absorbing column densities $\rm N_{H}>5\times10^{22}~cm^{-2}$ and ionization
parameters log $\xi$ > 3.7. Nevertheless, a wide range of SEDs would predict observable H I Ly$\alpha$
absorption if ionization parameters are only slightly below peak ionization fractions for Fe XXV
and Fe XXVI. The lack of Ly$\alpha$ features in the archival UV spectra indicates that either the
UFOs have very high ionization parameters, very hard UV-ionizing spectra, or that they were not
present at the time of the UV spectral observations due to variability.
