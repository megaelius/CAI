We have fit the far-ultraviolet (FUV) to sub-millimeter (850 micron) spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of the 61 galaxies from the "Key Insights on Nearby Galaxies: A Far-Infrared Survey with Herschel"
(KINGFISH). The fitting has been performed using three models: the Code for Investigating GALaxy
Evolution (CIGALE), the GRAphite-SILicate approach (GRASIL), and the Multi-wavelength Analysis
of Galaxy PHYSical properties (MAGPHYS). We have analyzed the results of the three codes in terms
of the SED shapes, and by comparing the derived quantities with simple "recipes" for stellar mass
(Mstar), star-formation rate (SFR), dust mass (Mdust), and monochromatic luminosities. Although
the algorithms rely on different assumptions for star-formation history, dust attenuation and
dust reprocessing, they all well approximate the observed SEDs and are in generally good agreement
for the associated quantities. However, the three codes show very different behavior in the mid-infrared
regime, in particular between 25 and 70 micron where there are no observational constraints for
the KINGFISH sample. We find that different algorithms give discordant SFR estimates for galaxies
with low specific SFR, and that the standard "recipes" for calculating FUV absorption overestimate
the extinction compared to the SED-fitting results. Results also suggest that assuming a "standard"
constant stellar mass-to-light ratio overestimates Mstar relative to the SED fitting, and we provide
new SED-based formulations for estimating Mstar from WISE W1 (3.4 micron) luminosities and colors.
From a Principal Component Analysis of Mstar, SFR, Mdust, and O/H, we reproduce previous scaling
relations among Mstar, SFR, and O/H, and find that Mdust can be predicted to within roughly 0.3 dex
using only Mstar and SFR.
