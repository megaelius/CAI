Long baseline radio interferometers can provide some interesting opportunities for future SETI
searches. Known advantages (compared to single dishes or beam-formed arrays), include the large
reduction in false-positives due to the interferometer's natural suppression of RFI. This paper
presents other advantages - the presence of multiple interferometer baselines in an array provide
an important level of redundancy and additional confidence (verification) in the detection of
faint and potentially transient signals. The SETI requirement for high time and frequency resolution
is well matched to wide-field VLBI techniques that permits the simultaneous analysis of thousands
of potential SETI targets within the field-of-view. Searching for a SETI signal in the image plane
has the important advantage that the signal location on the sky is likely to be invariant on short
timescales - this is a useful constraint when potentially almost everything else could be changing
(eg frequency drift due to Doppler accelerations). Using archive data, we demonstrate how VLBI
can be used to conduct SETI searches. We target two targets within the field of view - a galactic star
and a galaxy at a redshift of 0.14. We place coarse upper limits on any SETI signals from the two SETI
targets, and note that while the EIRP associated with the galaxy is comparable to the energy resources
of a Kardashev Type 2 civilisation, a distributed array of coherent transmitters with excellent
forward gain, could reduce this to more modest levels. We therefore argue that targeted observations
of extragalactic sources may also be merited by interferometer surveys. Using VLBI to study the
precise location and motion of confirmed SETI signals is also discussed.
