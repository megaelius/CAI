We present a statistical isophotal analysis of 138 early-type galaxies in the Antlia cluster, located
at a distance of ${\sim} 35$ Mpc. The observational material consists of CCD images of four $36$ arcmin
${\times} 36$ arcmin fields obtained with the MOSAIC II camera at the Blanco 4-m telescope at CTIO.
Our present work supersedes previous Antlia studies in the sense that the covered area is four times
larger, the limiting magnitude is $M_{B} {\sim} -9.6$ mag, and the surface photometry parameters
of each galaxy are derived from S\'ersic model fits extrapolated to infinity. In a companion previous
study we focused on the scaling relations obtained by means of surface photometry, and now we present
the data, on which the previous paper is based, the parameters of the isophotal fits as well as an isophotal
analysis. For each galaxy, we derive isophotal shape parameters along the semi-major axis and search
for correlations within different radial bins. Through extensive statistical tests, we also analyse
the behaviour of these values against photometric and global parameters of the galaxies themselves.
While some galaxies do display radial gradients in their ellipticity (${\epsilon}$) and/or their
Fourier coefficients, differences in mean values between adjacent regions are not statistically
significant. Regarding Fourier coefficients, dwarf galaxies usually display gradients between
all adjacent regions, while non-dwarfs tend to show this behaviour just between the two outermost
regions. Globally, there is no obvious correlation between Fourier coefficients and luminosity
for the whole magnitude range ($-12 {\gtrsim} M_{V} {\gtrsim} -22$); however, dwarfs display much
higher dispersions at all radii.
