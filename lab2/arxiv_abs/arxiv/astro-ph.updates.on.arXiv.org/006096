We report the discovery of the most distant radio galaxy to date, TGSS1530 at a redshift of $z=5.72$
close to the presumed end of the Epoch of Reionisation. The radio galaxy was selected from the TGSS
ADR1 survey at 150 MHz for having to an ultra-steep spectral index, $\alpha^{\textrm{150 MHz}}_{\textrm{1.4
GHz}} = -1.4$ and a compact morphology obtained using VLA imaging at 1.4 GHz. No optical or infrared
counterparts for it were found in publicly available sky surveys. Follow-up optical spectroscopy
at the radio position using GMOS on Gemini North revealed the presence of a single emission line.
We identify this line as Lyman alpha at $z=5.72$, because of its asymmetric line profile, the absence
of other optical/UV lines in the spectrum and a high equivalent width. With a Ly$\alpha$ luminosity
of $5.7 \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and a FWHM of $370$ km s$^{-1}$, TGSS1530 is comparable to `non-radio'
Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) at a similar redshift. However, with a radio luminosity of $\log L_{\textrm{150
MHz}} = 29.1$ W Hz$^{-1}$ and a deconvolved physical size $3.5$ kpc, its radio properties are similar
to other known radio galaxies at $z>4$. Subsequent $J$ and $K$ band imaging using LUCI on the Large
Binocular Telescope resulted in non-detection of the host galaxy down to $3\sigma$ limits of $J>24.4$
and $K>22.4$ (Vega). The $K$ band limit is consistent with $z>5$ from the $K-z$ relation for radio
galaxies, suggesting stellar mass limits using simple stellar population models of $M_{\textrm{stars}}<
10^{10.5}$ $M_\odot$. Its high redshift coupled with relatively small radio and Ly$\alpha$ sizes
suggest that TGSS1530 may be a radio galaxy in an early phase of its evolution.
