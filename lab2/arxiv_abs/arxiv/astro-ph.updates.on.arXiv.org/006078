Speckle imaging is a well known method to achieve diffraction-limited (DL) imaging from ground-based
telescopes. The traditional observing method for speckle has been to observe a single, unresolved,
source per telescope pointing over a relatively small field of view (FOV). The need for large DL surveys
of targets with high sky density motivates a desire for simultaneous speckle imaging over large
FOVs, however it is currently impractical to attain this by covering the entire focal plane with
fast readout detectors. An alternative approach is to connect a relatively small number of detector
pixels to multiple interesting targets spanning a large FOV through the use of optical fibers, a
technique employed in spectroscopy for decades. However, for imaging we require the use of coherent
fiber bundles (CFBs). We discuss various design considerations for coherent fiber speckle imaging
with an eye toward a multiplexed system using numerous configurable CFBs, and we test its viability
with a prototype instrument that uses a single CFB to transport speckle images from the telescope
focal plane to a traditionally designed, fast readout speckle camera. Using this device on University
of Virginia's Fan Mountain Observatory 40-inch telescope we have for the first time successfully
demonstrated speckle imaging through a CFB, using both optical and NIR detectors. Results are presented
of DL speckle imaging of well-known close (including subarcsecond) binary stars resolved with
this fiber-fed speckle system and compared to both literature results and traditional speckle
imaging taken with the same camera directly, with no intervening CFB.
