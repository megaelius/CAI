The stars of the middle main sequence have relatively quiescent outer layers, and unusual chemical
abundance patterns may develop in their atmospheres. The presence of chemical peculiarities reveal
the action of such subsurface phenomena as gravitational settling and radiatively driven levitation
of trace elements, and their competition with mixing processes such as turbulent diffusion. We
want to establish whether abundance peculiarities change as stars evolve on the main sequence,
and provide observational constraints to diffusion theory. We have performed spectral analysis
of 15 magnetic Bp stars that are members of open clusters (and thus have well-known ages), with masses
between about 3 and 4 M_sun. For each star, we measured the abundances of He, O, Mg, Si, Ti, Cr, Fe, Pr
and Nd. We have discovered the systematic time evolution of trace elements through the main-sequence
lifetime of magnetic chemically peculiar stars as their atmospheres cool and evolve toward lower
gravity. During the main sequence lifetime, we observe clear and systematic variations in the atmospheric
abundances of He, Ti, Cr, Fe, Pr and Nd. For all these elements, except He, the atmospheric abundances
decrease with age. The abundances of Fe-peak elements converge toward solar values, while the rare-earth
elements converge toward values at least 100 times more abundant than in the Sun. Helium is always
underabundant compared to the Sun, evolving from about 1% up to 10% of the solar He abundance. We have
attempted to interpret the observed abundance variations in the context of radiatively driven
diffusion theory, which appears to provide a framework to understand some, but not all, of the observed
anomalous abundance levels and variations.
