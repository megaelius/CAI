To facilitate multimessenger studies with TeV and PeV astrophysical neutrinos, the IceCube Collaboration
has developed a realtime alert system for the highest confidence and best localized neutrino events.
In this work we investigate the likelihood of association between realtime high-energy neutrino
alerts and explosive optical transients, with a focus on core-collapse supernovae (CC SNe) as candidate
neutrino sources. We report results from triggered optical follow-up observations of two IceCube
alerts, IC170922A and IC171106A, with Blanco/DECam ($gri$ to 24th magnitude in $\sim6$ epochs).
Based on a suite of simulated supernova light curves, we develop and validate selection criteria
for CC SNe exploding in coincidence with neutrino alerts. The DECam observations are sensitive
to CC SNe at redshifts $z \lesssim 0.3$. At redshifts $z \lesssim 0.1$, our selection criteria reduce
background SNe contamination to a level below the predicted signal. For the IC170922A (IC171106A)
follow-up observations, we expect that 12.1% (9.5%) of coincident CC SNe at $z \lesssim 0.3$ are
recovered, and that on average, 0.23 (0.07) unassociated SNe in the 90% containment regions also
pass our selection criteria. We find two total candidate CC SNe that are temporally coincident with
the neutrino alerts, but none in the 90% containment regions, which is statistically consistent
with expected rates of background CC SNe for these observations. Given the signal efficiencies
and background rates derived from this pilot study, we estimate that to determine whether CC SNe
are the dominant contribution to the total TeV-PeV energy IceCube neutrino flux at the $3\sigma$
confidence level, DECam observations similar to those of this work would be needed for $\sim200$
neutrino alerts, though this number falls to $\sim60$ neutrino alerts if redshift information
is available for all candidates.
