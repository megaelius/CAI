In this work we study the effect of disequilibrium processes on mixing ratio profiles of neutral
species and on the simulated spectra of a hot Jupiter exoplanet that orbits stars of different spectral
types. We also address the impact of stellar activity that should be present to a different degree
in all stars with convective envelopes. We used the VULCAN chemical kinetic code to compute number
densities of species. The temperature-pressure profile of the atmosphere was computed with the
HELIOS code. We also utilized the $\tau$-ReX forward model to predict the spectra of planets in primary
and secondary eclipses. In order to account for the stellar activity we made use of the observed solar
XUV spectrum taken from Virtual Planetary Laboratory (VPL) as a proxy for an active sun-like star.
We find large changes in mixing ratios of most chemical species in planets orbiting A-type stars
that radiate strong XUV flux inducing a very effective photodissociation. For some species, these
changes can propagate very deep into the planetary atmosphere to pressures of around 1 bar. To observe
disequilibrium chemistry we favor hot Jupiters with temperatures Teq=1000 K and ultra-hot Jupiters
with Teq=3000$ K that also have temperature inversion in their atmospheres. On the other hand, disequilibrium
calculations predict little changes in spectra of planets with intermediate temperatures. We
also show that stellar activity similar to the one of the modern Sun drives important changes in mixing
ratio profiles of atmospheric species. However, these changes take place at very high atmospheric
altitudes and thus do not affect predicted spectra. We estimate that the effect of disequilibrium
chemistry in planets orbiting nearby bright stars could be robustly detected and studied with future
missions with spectroscopic capabilities in infrared such as, e.g., JWST and ARIEL.
