Current theories and models attempt to explain star formation globally, from core scales to giant
molecular cloud scales. A multi-scale observational characterisation of an entire molecular
complex is necessary to constrain them. We investigate star formation in G202.3+2.5, a ~10x3 pc
sub-region of the Monoceros OB1 cloud with a complex morphology harbouring interconnected filamentary
structures. We aim to connect the evolution of cores and filaments in G202.3+2.5 with the global
evolution of the cloud and to identify the engines of the cloud dynamics. In this first paper, the
star formation activity is evaluated by surveying the distributions of dense cores and protostars,
and their evolutionary state, as characterised using both infrared observations from the Herschel
and WISE telescopes and molecular line observations with the IRAM 30-m telescope. We find ongoing
star formation in the whole cloud, with a local peak in star formation activity around the centre
of G202.3+2.5 where a chain of massive cores (10-50 Msun) forms a massive ridge (>150 Msun). All evolutionary
stages from starless cores to Class II protostars are found in G202.3+2.5, including a possibly
starless, large column density (8x10^{22} cm-2), and massive (52 Msun) core. All the core-scale
observables examined in this paper point to an enhanced star formation activity centred on the junction
between the three main branches of the ramified structure of G202.3+2.5. This suggests that the
increased star-formation activity results from the convergence of these branches. To further
investigate the origin of this enhancement, it is now necessary to extend the analysis to larger
scales, in order to examine the relationship between cores, filaments and their environment. We
address these points through the analysis of the dynamics of G202.3+2.5 in a joint paper.
