We provide homogeneous optical (UBVRI) and near-infrared (JHK) time series photometry for 254
cluster (omega Cen, M4) and field RR Lyrae (RRL) variables. We ended up with more than 551,000 measurements.
For 94 fundamental (RRab) and 51 first overtones (RRc) we provide a complete optical/NIR characterization
(mean magnitudes, luminosity amplitudes, epoch of the anchor point). The NIR light curves of these
variables were adopted to provide new and accurate light-curve templates for both RRc (single period
bin) and RRab (three period bins) variables. The templates for the J and the H band are newly introduced,
together with the use of the pulsation period to discriminate among the different RRab templates.
To overcome subtle uncertainties in the fit of secondary features of the light curves we provide
two independent sets of analytical functions (Fourier series, Periodic Gaussian functions).
The new templates were validated by using 26 omega Cen and Bulge RRLs covering the four period bins.
We found that the difference between the measured mean magnitude along the light curve and the mean
magnitude estimated by using the template on a single randomly extracted phase point is better than
0.01 mag (sigma=0.04 mag). We also validated the template on variables for which at least three phase
points were available, but without information on the phase of the anchor point. The accuracy of
the mean magnitudes is ~0.01 mag (sigma=0.04 mag). The new templates were applied to the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC) globular Reticulum and by using literature data and predicted PLZ relations we found
true distance moduli of 18.47+-0.10+-0.03 mag (J) and 18.49+-0.09+-0.05 mag (K). We also used literature
optical and mid-infrared data and we found a mean true distance modulus of 18.47+-0.02+-0.06 mag,
suggesting that Reticulum is ~1 kpc closer than the LMC.
