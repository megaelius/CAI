The last couple of decades have seen an emergence of transient detection facilities in various avenues
of time domain astronomy which has provided us with a rich dataset of transients. The rates of these
transients have implications in star formation, progenitor models, evolution channels and cosmology
measurements. The crucial component of any rate calculation is the detectability and space-time
volume sensitivity of a survey to a particular transient type as a function of many intrinsic and
extrinsic parameters. Fully sampling that multi-dimensional parameter space is challenging.
Instead, we present a scheme to assess the detectability of transients using supervised machine
learning. The data product is a classifier that determines the detection likelihood of sources
resulting from an image subtraction pipeline associated with time domain survey telescopes, taking
into consideration the intrinsic properties of the transients and the observing conditions. We
apply our method to assess the space-time volume sensitivity of type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia) in the
intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) and obtain the result,$\langle VT\rangle_{\mathrm{Ia}}=2.93\pm
0.21\times 10^{-2}\mathrm{Gpc^{3}yr}$. With rate estimates in the literature, this volume sensitivity
gives a count of $680-1160$ SNe~Ia detectable by iPTF which is consistent with the archival data.
With a view toward wider applicability of this technique we do a preliminary computation for long-duration
type IIp supernovae (SNe~IIp) and find $\langle VT\rangle_{\mathrm{IIp}}=7.80\pm0.76\times10^{-4}\mathrm{Gpc^{3}yr}$.
This classifier can be used for computationally fast space-time volume sensitivity calculation
of any generic transient type using their lightcurve properties. Hence, it can be used as a tool to
facilitate calculation of transient rates in a range of time-domain surveys, given suitable training
sets.
