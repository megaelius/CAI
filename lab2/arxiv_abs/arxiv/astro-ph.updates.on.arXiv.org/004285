We present Bayesian Analysis of Galaxies for Physical Inference and Parameter EStimation, or BAGPIPES,
a new Python tool which can be used to rapidly generate complex model galaxy spectra and to fit these
to arbitrary combinations of spectroscopic and photometric data using the MultiNest algorithm.
We extensively test our ability to recover realistic star-formation histories (SFHs) with BAGPIPES
by fitting mock observations of quiescent galaxies from the MUFASA simulation. We show that a double-power-law
model produces better agreement with realistic SFHs than an exponentially-declining model. We
then perform a detailed analysis of the SFHs of a sample of 9312 quiescent galaxies from UltraVISTA
with stellar masses, $M_* > 10^{10}\ \mathrm{M_\odot}$ and redshifts $0.25 < z_\mathrm{obs} <
3.75$. The majority of our quiescent sample exhibit SFHs which rise gradually then quench relatively
rapidly, over $\sim 1{-}2$ Gyr. This behaviour is consistent with recent cosmological hydrodynamic
simulations, where AGN-driven feedback in the low-accretion (jet) mode is the dominant quenching
mechanism. In addition, we identify two further subsets of objects with distinct SFH shapes. At
$z_\mathrm{obs} \gtrsim 1$ we find a class of objects with SFHs which rise and fall very rapidly,
with quenching timescales of $\lesssim 1$ Gyr. These objects are consistent with (potentially
merger-triggered) quasar-mode AGN feedback. Also, at $z_\mathrm{obs} \lesssim 1$ we find a population
with SFHs which quench more slowly than they rise, over $\gtrsim3$ Gyr, which we speculate to be the
result of a 'natural' quenching process, where galaxy SFHs die down gradually due to the diminishing
overall cosmic gas supply. Purely passive evolution of the quiescent population at $z_\mathrm{obs}
\gtrsim 0.5$ is disfavoured by our results.
