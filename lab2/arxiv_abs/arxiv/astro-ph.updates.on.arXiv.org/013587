We report on simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of the repeating fast radio burst source
FRB 180916.J0158+65 using the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME), Effelsberg,
and Deep Space Network (DSS-14 and DSS-63) radio telescopes and the Chandra X-ray Observatory.
During 33 ks of Chandra observations, we detect no radio bursts in overlapping Effelsberg or Deep
Space Network observations and a single radio burst during CHIME/FRB source transits. We detect
no X-ray events in excess of the background during the Chandra observations. These non-detections
imply a 5-$\sigma$ limit of $<5\times10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ for the 0.5--10 keV fluence of prompt
emission at the time of the radio burst and $1.3\times10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ at any time during the
Chandra observations at the position of FRB 180916.J0158+65. Given the host-galaxy redshift of
FRB 180916.J0158+65 ($z\sim0.034$), these correspond to energy limits of $<1.6\times10^{45}$
erg and $<4\times10^{45}$ erg, respectively. We also place a 5-$\sigma$ limit of $<8\times10^{-15}$
erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ on the 0.5--10\,keV absorbed flux of a persistent source at the location
of FRB 180916.J0158+65. This corresponds to a luminosity limit of $<2\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$.
Using Fermi/GBM data we search for prompt gamma-ray emission at the time of radio bursts from FRB
180916.J0158+65 and find no significant bursts, placing a limit of $4\times10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$
on the 10--100 keV fluence. We also search Fermi/LAT data for periodic modulation of the gamma-ray
brightness at the 16.35-day period of radio-burst activity and detect no significant modulation.
We compare these deep limits to the predictions of various fast radio burst models, but conclude
that similar X-ray constraints on a closer fast radio burst source would be needed to strongly constrain
theory.
