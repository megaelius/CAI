We present hydrodynamic simulations of self-gravitating dense gas in a galactic disk, exploring
scales ranging from 1 kpc down to $\sim 0.1$~pc. Our primary goal is to understand how dense filaments
form in Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs). These structures, often observed as Infrared Dark Clouds
(IRDCs) in the Galactic plane, are thought to be the precursors to massive stars and star clusters,
so their formation may be the rate limiting step controlling global star formation rates in galactic
systems as described by the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. Our study follows on from Van Loo et al.
(2013, Paper I), which carried out simulations to 0.5~pc resolution and examined global aspects
of the formation of dense gas clumps and the resulting star formation rate. Here, using our higher
resolution, we examine the detailed structural, kinematic and dynamical properties of dense filaments
and clumps, including mass surface density ($\Sigma$) probability distribution functions, filament
mass per unit length and its dispersion, lateral $\Sigma$ profiles, filament fragmentation, filament
velocity gradients and infall, and degree of filament and clump virialization. Where possible,
these properties are compared to observations of IRDCs. By many metrics, especially too large mass
fractions of high $\Sigma>1\:{\rm g\:cm^{-2}}$ material, too high mass per unit length dispersion
due to dense clump formation, too high velocity gradients and too high velocity dispersion for a
given mass per unity length, the simulated filaments differ from observed IRDCs. We thus conclude
that IRDCs do not form from global fast collapse of GMCs. Rather, we expect IRDC formation and collapse
is slowed significantly by the influence of dynamically important magnetic fields, which may thus
play a crucial role in regulating galactic star formation rates.
