In several models of galaxy formation feedback occurs in cycles or mainly at high redshift. At times
and in regions where feedback heating is ineffective, hot gas in the galaxy halo is expected to form
a cooling flow, where the gas advects inward on a cooling timescale. Cooling flow solutions can thus
be used as a benchmark for observations and simulations to constrain the timing and extent of feedback
heating. Using analytic calculations and idealized 3D hydrodynamic simulations, we show that
for a given halo mass and cooling function, steady-state cooling flows form a single-parameter
family of solutions, while initially hydrostatic gaseous halos converge on one of these solutions
within a cooling time. The solution is thus fully determined once either the mass inflow rate $\dot{M}$
or the total halo gas mass are known. In the Milky Way (MW) halo, a cooling flow with $\dot{M}$ equal
to the star formation rate predicts a ratio of the cooling time to the free-fall time of ~10, similar
to some feedback-regulated models. This solution also correctly predicts observed OVII and OVIII
absorption columns, and the gas density profile implied by OVII and OVIII emission. These results
suggest ongoing heating by feedback may be negligible in the inner MW halo. Extending similar solutions
out to the cooling radius however underpredicts observed OVI columns around the MW and around other
low-redshift star-forming galaxies. This can be reconciled with the successes of the cooling flow
model with either a mechanism which preferentially heats the OVI-bearing outer halo, or alternatively
if OVI traces cool photoionized gas beyond the accretion shock. We also demonstrate that the entropy
profiles of some of the most relaxed clusters are reasonably well described by a cooling flow solution.
