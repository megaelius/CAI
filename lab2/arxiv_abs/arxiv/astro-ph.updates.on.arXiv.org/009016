The habitability of a planet depends on various factors, such as delivery of water during the formation,
the co-evolution of the interior and the atmosphere, as well as the stellar irradiation which changes
in time. Since an unknown number of rocky exoplanets may operate in a one-plate convective regime,
i.e., without plate tectonics, we aim at understanding under which conditions planets in such a
stagnant-lid regime may support habitable surface conditions. Understanding the interaction
of the planetary interior and outgassing of volatiles with the atmosphere in combination with the
evolution of the host star is crucial to determine the potential habitability. M-dwarf stars in
particular possess a high-luminosity pre-main sequence phase which endangers the habitability
of planets around them via water loss. We therefore explore the potential of secondary outgassing
from the planetary interior to rebuild a water reservoir allowing for habitability at a later stage.
We compute the boundaries of the habitable zone around M, K, G, and F-dwarf stars using a 1D cloud-free
radiative-convective climate model accounting for the outgassing history of CO2 and H2O from an
interior evolution and outgassing model for different interior compositions and stellar luminosity
evolutions. The outer edge of the habitable zone strongly depends on the amount of CO2 outgassed
from the interior, while the inner edge is mainly determined via the stellar irradiation, as soon
as a sufficiently large water reservoir has been outgassed. A build-up of a secondary water reservoir
for planets around M-dwarf stars is possible even after severe water loss during the high luminosity
pre-main sequence phase as long as some water has been retained within the mantle. Earth-like stagnant-lid
planets allow for habitable surface conditions within a continuous habitable zone that is dependent
on interior composition.
