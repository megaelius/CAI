We estimate the "non-gravitational" entropy-injection profiles, $\Delta K$, and the resultant
energy feedback profiles, $\Delta E$, of the intracluster medium for 17 clusters using their Planck
SZ and ROSAT X-Ray observations, spanning a large radial range from $0.2r_{500}$ up to $r_{200}$.
The feedback profiles are estimated by comparing the observed entropy, at fixed gas mass shells,
with theoretical entropy profiles predicted from non-radiative hydrodynamic simulations. We
include non-thermal pressure and gas clumping in our analysis. The inclusion of non-thermal pressure
and clumping results in changing the estimates for $r_{500}$ and $r_{200}$ by 10\%-20\%. When clumpiness
is not considered it leads to an under-estimation of $\Delta K\approx300$ keV cm$^2$ at $r_{500}$
and $\Delta K\approx1100$ keV cm$^2$ at $r_{200}$. On the other hand, neglecting non-thermal pressure
results in an over-estimation of $\Delta K\approx 100$ keV cm$^2$ at $r_{500}$ and under-estimation
of $\Delta K\approx450$ keV cm$^2$ at $r_{200}$. For the estimated feedback energy, we find that
ignoring clumping leads to an under-estimation of energy per particle $\Delta E\approx1$ keV at
$r_{500}$ and $\Delta E\approx1.5$ keV at $r_{200}$. Similarly, neglect of the non-thermal pressure
results in an over-estimation of $\Delta E\approx0.5$ keV at $r_{500}$ and under-estimation of
$\Delta E\approx0.25$ keV at $r_{200}$. We find entropy floor of $\Delta K\approx300$ keV cm$^2$
is ruled out at $\approx3\sigma$ throughout the entire radial range and $\Delta E\approx1$ keV
at more than 3$\sigma$ beyond $r_{500}$, strongly constraining ICM pre-heating scenarios. We
also demonstrate robustness of results w.r.t sample selection, X-Ray analysis procedures, entropy
modeling etc.
