Since January 2017, the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients survey (CRAFT) has been utilising
commissioning antennas of the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) to survey for fast radio bursts
(FRBs) in fly's eye mode. This is the first extensive astronomical survey using phased array feeds
(PAFs), and a total of 20 FRBs have been reported. Here we present a calculation of the sensitivity
and total exposure of this survey, using the pulsars B1641-45 (J1644-4559) and B0833-45 (J0835-4510,
i.e.\ Vela) as calibrators. The design of the survey allows us to benchmark effects due to PAF beamshape,
antenna-dependent system noise, radio-frequency interference, and fluctuations during commissioning
on timescales from one hour to a year. Observation time, solid-angle, and search efficiency are
calculated as a function of FRB fluence threshold. Using this metric, effective survey exposures
and sensitivities are calculated as a function of the source counts distribution. The implied FRB
rate is significantly lower than the $37$\,sky$^{-1}$\,day$^{-1}$ calculated using nominal
exposures and sensitivities for this same sample by \citet{craft_nature}. At the Euclidean power-law
index of $-1.5$, the rate is $10.7_{-1.8}^{+2.7}\,{\rm (sys)} \, \pm \, 3\,{\rm (stat)}$\,sky$^{-1}$\,day$^{-1}$
above a threshold of $57\pm6\,{\rm (sys)}$\,Jy\,ms, while for the best-fit index for this sample
of $-2.1$, it is $16.6_{-1.5}^{+1.9} \,{\rm (sys)}\, \pm 4.7\,{\rm (stat)}$\,sky$^{-1}$\,day$^{-1}$
above a threshold of $41.6\pm1.5\,{\rm (sys)}$\,Jy\,ms. This strongly suggests that these calculations
be performed for other FRB-hunting experiments, allowing meaningful comparisons to be made between
them.
