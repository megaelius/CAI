We have measured the radial profiles of isophotal ellipticity ($\varepsilon$) and disky/boxy
parameter A$_4$ out to radii of about three times the semi-major axes for $\sim4,600$ star-forming
galaxies (SFGs) at intermediate redshifts $0.5<z<1.8$ in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and UDS fields.
Based on the average size versus stellar-mass relation in each redshift bin, we divide our galaxies
into Small SFGs (SSFGs), i.e., smaller than average for its mass, and Large SFGs (LSFGs), i.e., larger
than average. We find that, at low masses ($M_{\ast} < 10^{10}M_{\odot}$), the SSFGs generally
have nearly flat $\varepsilon$ and A$_4$ profiles for both edge-on and face-on views, especially
at redshifts $z>1$. Moreover, the median A$_4$ values at all radii are almost zero. In contrast,
the highly-inclined, low-mass LSFGs in the same mass-redshift bins generally have monotonically
increasing $\varepsilon$ with radius and are dominated by disky values at intermediate radii.
These findings at intermediate redshifts imply that low-mass SSFGs are not disk-like, while low-mass
LSFGs appear to harbour disk-like components flattened by significant rotation. At high masses
($M_{\ast} > 10^{10}M_{\odot}$), highly-inclined SSFGs and LSFGs both exhibit a general, distinct
trend for both $\varepsilon$ and A$_4$ profiles: increasing values with radius at lower radii,
reaching maxima at intermediate radii, and then decreasing values at larger radii. Such a trend
is more prevalent for more massive ($M_{\ast} > 10^{10.5}M_{\odot}$) galaxies or those at lower
redshifts ($z<1.4$). The distinct trend in $\varepsilon$ and A$_4$ can be simply explained if galaxies
possess all three components: central bulges, disks in the intermediate regions, and halo-like
stellar components in the outskirts.
