The fastest molecular component to the protostellar outflows -- extremely high-velocity (EHV)
molecular jets -- are still puzzling since they are seen only rarely. The first aim is to analyze the
interaction between the EHV jet and the slow outflow by comparing their outflow force content. The
second aim is to analyze the chemical composition of the different outflow velocity components
and to reveal the spatial location of molecules. ALMA 3 mm and 1.3 mm observations of five outflow
sources at 130 -- 260 au resolution in the Serpens Main cloud are presented. Observations of CO, SiO,
H$_2$CO and HCN reveal the kinematic and chemical structure of those flows. Three velocity components
are distinguished: the slow and the fast wing, and the EHV jet. Out of five sources, three have the
EHV component. Comparison of outflow forces reveals that only the EHV jet in the youngest source
Ser-emb 8 (N) has enough momentum to power the slow outflow. The SiO abundance is generally enhanced
with velocity, while HCN is present in the slow and the fast wing, but disappears in the EHV jet. For
Ser-emb 8 (N), HCN and SiO show a bow-shock shaped structure surrounding one of the EHV peaks suggesting
sideways ejection creating secondary shocks upon interaction with the surroundings. Also, the
SiO abundance in the EHV gas decreases with distance from this protostar, whereas that in the fast
wing increases. H$_2$CO is mostly associated with low-velocity gas but also appears surprisingly
in one of the bullets in the Ser-emb~8~(N) EHV jet. The high detection rate suggests that the presence
of the EHV jet may be more common than previously expected. The origin and temporal evolution of the
abundances of SiO, HCN and H$_2$CO through high-temperature chemistry are discussed. The data
are consistent with a low C/O ratio in the EHV gas versus high C/O ratio in the fast and slow wings.
