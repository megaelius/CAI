Dynamic characterization of mechanical properties of dust aggregates has been one of the most important
problems to quantitatively discuss the dust growth in protoplanetary disks. We experimentally
investigate the dynamic properties of dust aggregates by low-speed ($\lesssim 3.2$ m s$^{-1}$)
impacts of solid projectiles. Spherical impactors made of glass, steel, or lead are dropped onto
a dust aggregate of packing fraction $\phi=0.35$ under vacuum conditions. The impact results in
cratering or fragmentation of the dust aggregate, depending on the impact energy. The crater shape
can be approximated by a spherical segment and no ejecta are observed. To understand the underlying
physics of impacts into dust aggregates, the motion of the solid projectile is acquired by a high-speed
camera. Using the obtained position data of the impactor, we analyze the drag-force law and dynamic
pressure induced by the impact. We find that there are two characteristic strengths. One is defined
by the ratio between impact energy and crater volume and is $\simeq 120$ kPa. The other strength indicates
the fragmentation threshold of dynamic pressure and is $\simeq 10$ kPa. The former characterizes
the apparent plastic deformation and is consistent with the drag force responsible for impactor
deceleration. The latter corresponds to the dynamic tensile strength to create cracks. Using these
results, a simple model for the compaction and fragmentation threshold of dust aggregates is proposed.
In addition, the comparison of drag-force laws for dust aggregates and loose granular matter reveals
the similarities and differences between the two materials.
