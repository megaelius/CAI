Low sonic Mach number shocks form in the intracluster medium (ICM) during the formation of the large-scale
structure of the universe. Nonthermal cosmic-ray (CR) protons are expected to be accelerated via
diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in those ICM shocks, although observational evidence for the
$\gamma$-ray emission of hadronic origin from galaxy clusters has yet to be established. Considering
the results obtained from recent plasma simulations, we improve the analytic test-particle DSA
model for weak quasi-parallel ($Q_\parallel$) shocks, previously suggested by \citet{kang2010}.
In the model CR spectrum, the transition from the postshock thermal to CR populations occurs at the
injection momentum, $p_{\rm inj}$, above which protons can undergo the full DSA process. As the
shock energy is transferred to CR protons, the postshock gas temperature should decrease accordingly
and the subshock strength weakens due to the dynamical feed of the CR pressure to the shock structure.
This results in the reduction of the injection fraction, although the postshock CR pressure approaches
an asymptotic value when the CR spectrum extends to the relativistic regime. Our new DSA model self-consistently
accounts for such behaviors and adopts better estimations for $p_{\rm inj}$. With our model DSA
spectrum, the CR acceleration efficiency ranges $\eta\sim10^{-3}-0.01$ for supercritical,
$Q_\parallel$-shocks with sonic Mach number $2.25\lesssim M_{\rm s}\lesssim5$ in the ICM. Based
on \citet{ha2018b}, on the other hand, we argue that proton acceleration would be negligible in
subcritical shocks with $M_{\rm s}<2.25$.
