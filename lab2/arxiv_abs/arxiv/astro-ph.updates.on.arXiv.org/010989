A terrestrial planet is molten during formation and may remain so if subject to intense insolation
or tidal forces. Observations continue to favour the detection and characterisation of hot planets,
potentially with large outgassed atmospheres. We aim to determine the radius of hot Earth-like
planets with large outgassed atmospheres and explore differences between molten and solid silicate
planets and their influence on the mass-radius relationship and transmission and emission spectra.
An interior-atmosphere model, combined with static structure calculations, tracks the evolving
radius of a rocky mantle that is outgassing CO$_2$ and H$_2$O. Synthetic emission and transmission
spectra are generated for CO$_2$ and H$_2$O dominated atmospheres. Atmospheres dominated by CO$_2$
suppress the outgassing of H$_2$O to a greater extent than previously realised, as previous studies
have applied an erroneous relationship between volatile mass and partial pressure. We therefore
predict more H$_2$O can be retained by the interior during the later stages of magma ocean crystallisation.
Furthermore, formation of a lid at the surface can tie outgassing of H$_2$O to the efficiency of heat
transport through the lid, rather than the atmosphere's radiative timescale. Contraction of the
mantle as it solidifies gives $\sim5\%$ radius decrease, which can partly be offset by addition
of a relatively light species to the atmosphere. We conclude that a molten silicate mantle can increase
the radius of a terrestrial planet by around $5\%$ compared to its solid counterpart, or equivalently
account for a $13\%$ decrease in bulk density. An outgassing atmosphere can perturb the total radius
according to its speciation. Atmospheres of terrestrial planets around M-stars that are dominated
by CO$_2$ or H$_2$O can be distinguished by observing facilities with extended wavelength coverage
(e.g., JWST).
