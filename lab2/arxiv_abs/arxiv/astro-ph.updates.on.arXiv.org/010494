The origin of the observed diversity of planetary system architectures is one of the main topic of
the exoplanetary research. The detection of a statistically significant sample of planets around
young stars allows us to study the early stages of planet formation and evolution, but only a handful
of them is known so far. In this regard, a considerable contribution is expected from the NASA TESS
satellite, which is now performing a survey of $\sim 85 \%$ of the sky to search for short-period transiting
planets In its first month of operations, TESS found a planet candidate with an orbital period of
8.14 days around a member of the Tuc-Hor young association ($\sim$ 40 Myr), the G6V main component
of the binary system DS\,Tuc. If confirmed, it would be the first transiting planet around a young
star suitable for radial velocity and/or atmospheric characterization. We aim to validate the
planetary nature of this companion and to measure its orbital and physical parameters. We obtain
accurate planet parameters by coupling an independent reprocessing of the TESS light curve with
improved stellar parameters and the dilution caused by the binary companion; we analyse high precision
archival radial velocities to impose an upper limit of about 0.1 M$_{\rm Jup}$ on the planet mass;
we finally rule out the presence of external companions beyond 40 au with adaptive optics images.
We confirm the presence of a young, giant (${\rm R} = 0.50$ R$_{\rm Jup}$) planet having a not negligible
possibility to be inflated (theoretical mass $\lesssim 20$ M$_{\oplus}$) around DS\,Tuc~A. We
discuss the feasibility of mass determination, Rossiter-McLaughlin analysis and atmosphere
characterization, allowed by the brightness of the star.
