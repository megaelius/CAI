Historically, it has often been asserted that most stars form in compact clusters. In this scenario,
present-day gravitationally-unbound OB associations are the result of the expansion of initially
gravitationally-bound star clusters. However, this paradigm is inconsistent with recent results,
both theoretical and observational, that instead favour a hierarchical picture of star formation
in which stars are formed across a continuous distribution of gas densities and most OB associations
never were bound clusters. Instead they are formed in-situ as the low-density side of this distribution,
rather than as the remnants of expanding clusters. We utilise the second $Gaia$ data release to quantify
the degree to which OB associations are undergoing expansion and, therefore, whether OB associations
are the product of expanding clusters, or whether they were born in-situ, as the large-scale, globally-unbound
associations that we see today. We find that the observed kinematic properties of associations
are consistent with highly substructured velocity fields and additionally require some degree
of localised expansion from sub-clusters within the association. While most present-day OB associations
do exhibit low levels of expansion, there is no significant correlation between radial velocity
and radius. Therefore, the large-scale structure of associations is not set by the expansion of
clusters, rather it is a relic of the molecular gas cloud from which the association was formed. This
finding is inconsistent with a monolithic model of association formation and instead favours a
hierarchical model, in which OB associations form in-situ, following the fractal structure of
the gas from which they form.
