We demonstrate that for data recorded with a solar telescope that uses adaptive optics and/or post-processing
to compensate for many low- and high-order aberrations, the RMS granulation contrast is directly
proportional to the Strehl ratio calculated from the residual (small-scale) wavefront error.
We demonstrate that the wings of the high-order compensated PSF for SST are likely to extend to a radius
of not more than about 2 arcsec, consistent with earlier conclusions drawn from straylight compensation
of sunspot images. We report on simultaneous measurements of seeing and solar granulation contrast
averaged over 2 sec time intervals at several wavelengths from 525 nm to 853.6 nm on the red-beam (CRISP
beam) and wavelengths from 395 nm to 484 nm on the blue-beam (CHROMIS beam). These data were recorded
with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) that has been revamped with an 85-electrode adaptive
mirror and a new tip-tilt mirror, both of which were polished to exceptionally high optical quality.
The highest 2-sec average image contrast measured in April 2015 through 0.3-0.9 nm interference
filters at 525 nm, 557 nm, 630 nm and 853.5 nm with compensation only for the diffraction limited point
spread function of SST is 11.8%, 11.8%, 10.2% and 7.2% respectively. Similarly, the highest 2-sec
contrast measured at 395 nm, 400 nm and 484 nm in May 2016 through 0.37-1.3 nm filters is 16%, 16% and
12.5% respectively. The granulation contrast observed with SST compares favorably with that of
other telescopes. Simultaneously with the above wideband red-beam data, we also recorded narrow-band
continuum images with the CRISP imaging spectropolarimeter. We find that contrasts measured with
CRISP are entirely consistent with the corresponding wide-band contrasts, demonstrating that
any additional image degradation by the CRISP etalons and telecentric optical system is marginal
or even insignificant.
