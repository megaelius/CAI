Proximity zone fossils (PZFs) are ionization signatures around recently active galactic nuclei
(AGN) where metal species in the circumgalactic medium remain over-ionized after the AGN has shut-off
due to their long recombination timescales. We explore cosmological zoom hydrodynamic simulations
using the EAGLE model paired with a non-equilibrium ionization and cooling module including time-variable
AGN radiation to model PZFs around star-forming, disk galaxies in the z~0.2 Universe. Previous
simulations typically under-estimated the O VI content of galactic haloes, but we show that plausible
PZF models increase O VI column densities by 2-3x to achieve the levels observed around COS-Halos
star-forming galaxies out to 150 kpc. Models with AGN bolometric luminosities >~10^43.6 erg s^-1,
duty cycle fractions <~10%, and AGN lifetimes <~10^6 yr are the most promising, because their super-massive
black holes grow at the cosmologically expected rate and they mostly appear as inactive AGN, consistent
with COS-Halos. The central requirement is that the typical star-forming galaxy hosted an active
AGN within a timescale comparable to the recombination time of a high metal ion, which for circumgalactic
O VI is 10^7 years. H I, by contrast, returns to equilibrium much more rapidly due to its low neutral
fraction and does not show a significant PZF effect. O VI absorption features originating from PZFs
appear narrow, indicating photo-ionization, and are often well-aligned with lower metal ion species.
PZFs are highly likely to affect the physical interpretation of circumgalactic high ionization
metal lines if, as expected, normal galaxies host flickering AGN.
