Asteroseismology has been impressively boosted during the last decade mainly thanks to space missions
such as Kepler/K2 and CoRoT. This has a large impact, in particular, in exoplanetary sciences since
the accurate characterization of the exoplanets is convoluted in most cases with the characterization
of their hosting star. Until the expected launch of the ESA mission PLATO 2.0, there is almost a decade
where only two important missions will provide short-cadence high-precision photometric time-series:
NASA--TESS and ESA--CHEOPS missions, both having high capabilities for exoplanetary sciences.
In this work, we want to explore the asteroseismic potential of CHEOPS time-series. Following the
works done for estimating the asteroseismic potential of Kepler and TESS, we have analyzed the probability
of detecting solar-like pulsations using CHEOPS light-curves. Since CHEOPS will collect runs
with observational times from hours up to a few days, we have analyzed the accuracy and precision
we can obtain for the estimation of nu_max, the only asteroseismic observable we can recover using
CHEOPS observations. Finally, we have analyzed the impact of knowing nu_max in the characterization
of exoplanet host stars. Using CHEOPS light-curves with the expected observational times we can
determine nu_max for massive G and F-type stars from late Main Sequence on, and for F, G, and K-type
stars from post-Main Sequence on with an uncertainty lower than a 5%. For magnitudes V<12 and observational
times from eight hours up to two days, the HR zone of potential detectability changes. The determination
of nu_max leads to an internal age uncertainty reduction in the characterization of exoplanet host
stars from 52% to 38%; mass uncertainty reduction from 2.1% to 1.8%; radius uncertainty reduction
from 1.8% to 1.6%; density uncertainty reduction from 5.6% to 4.7%, in our best scenarios.
