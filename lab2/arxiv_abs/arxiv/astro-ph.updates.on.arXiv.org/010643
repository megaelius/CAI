To reproduce the orbits and masses of the terrestrial planets (analogs) of the solar system, most
studies scrutinize simulations for success as a batch. However, there is insufficient discussion
in the literature on the likelihood of forming planet analogs simultaneously in the same system
(analog system). To address this issue, we performed 540 N-body simulations of protoplanetary
disks representative of typical models in the literature. We identified a total of 194 analog systems
containing at least three analogs, but only 17 systems simultaneously contained analogs of the
four terrestrial planets. From an analysis of our analog systems, we found that, compared to the
real planets, truncated disks based on typical outcomes of the Grand Tack model produced analogs
of Mercury and Mars that were too dynamically cold and located too close to the Venus and Earth analogs.
Additionally, all the Mercury analogs were too massive, while most of the Mars analogs were more
massive than Mars. Furthermore, the timing of the Moon-forming impact was too early in these systems,
and the amount of additional mass accreted after the event was too great. Therefore, such truncated
disks cannot explain the formation of the terrestrial planets. Our results suggest that forming
the four terrestrial planets requires disks with the following properties: 1) Mass concentrated
in narrow core regions between ~0.7-0.9 and ~1.0-1.2 au; 2) an inner region component starting at
~0.3-0.4 au; 3) a less massive component beginning at ~1.0-1.2 au; 4) embryos rather than planetesimals
carrying most of the disk mass; and 5) Jupiter and Saturn placed on eccentric orbits.
