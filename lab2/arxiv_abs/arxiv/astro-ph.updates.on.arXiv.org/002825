The nuclear starburst in the nearby galaxy M82 provides an excellent laboratory for understanding
the physics of star formation. This galaxy has been extensively observed in the past, revealing
tens of radio-bright compact objects embedded in a diffuse free-free absorbing medium. Our understanding
of the structure and physics of this medium in M82 can be greatly improved by high-resolution images
at low frequencies where the effects of free-free absorption are most prominent. The aims of this
study are, firstly, to demonstrate imaging using international baselines of the Low Frequency
Array (LOFAR), and secondly, to constrain low-frequency spectra of compact and diffuse emission
in the central starburst region of M82 via high-resolution radio imaging at low frequencies. The
international LOFAR telescope was used to observe M82 at 110-126MHz and 146-162MHz. Images were
obtained using standard techniques from very long baseline interferometry. images were obtained
at each frequency range: one only using international baselines, and one only using the longest
Dutch (remote) baselines. The 154MHz image obtained using international baselines is a new imaging
record in terms of combined image resolution (0.3$"$) and sensitivity ($\sigma$=0.15mJy/beam)
at low frequencies ($<327$MHz). We detected 16 objects at 154MHz, six of these also at 118MHz.
Four weaker but resolved features are also found: a linear (50pc) filament and three other resolved
objects, of which two show a clear shell structure. We do not detect any emission from either supernova
2008iz or from the radio transient source 43.78+59.3. The images obtained using remote baselines
show diffuse emission, associated with the outflow in M82, with reduced brightness in the region
of the edge-on star-forming disk.
