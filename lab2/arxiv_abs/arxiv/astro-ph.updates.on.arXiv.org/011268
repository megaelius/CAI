One of the major challenges in observational cosmology is related to the redshift evolution of the
average hydrogen ionization in the Universe. In order to probe the ionization level of the IGM and
the ionization capabilities of bright QSOs at z=4, we have selected a sample of 2508 QSOs from the
SDSS survey (DR14) at 3.6<z<4.6 and -29.0<M1450<-26.0. Starting from UV/optical rest-frame spectra
of the whole QSO sample, we estimate the escape fraction and free path individually for each of them.
We calculate the Lyman Continuum (LyC) escape fraction as the flux ratio blue-ward (~900 A rest-frame)
and red-ward (~930 A rest-frame) of the Lyman limit. We then obtain the probability distribution
function (PDF) of the individual free paths of the QSOs in the sample and study its evolution in luminosity
and redshift, comparing our results with the ones found in literature so far. We find a lower limit
to the mean LyC escape fraction of 0.49, in agreement with the values obtained for both brighter and
fainter sources at the same redshift. We show that the free paths of ionizing photons are characterized
by a skewed distribution function peaked at low values, with an average of ~49-59 proper Mpc at z~4,
after excluding possible associated absorbers. This value is larger than the one obtained at the
same redshift by many authors in the literature using different techniques. Finally, we also find
that the redshift evolution of this parameter results to be possibly milder than previously thought.
Our new determination of the mean free path at z~4 implies that previous estimates of the HI photo-ionization
rate Gamma_HI available in the literature should be corrected by a factor of 1.2-1.7. These results
have important implications if extrapolated at the epoch of reionization.
