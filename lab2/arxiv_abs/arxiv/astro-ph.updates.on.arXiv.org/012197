We aim to investigate the overall properties of the ICRF3 with the help of the Gaia Data release 2 (Gaia
DR2). This could serve as an external check of the quality of the ICRF3. The radio source positions
of the ICRF3 catalog were compared with the Gaia DR2 positions of their optical counterparts at G
< 18.7. Their properties were analyzed in terms of the dependency of the quoted error on the number
of observations, on the declination, and the global difference, the latter revealed by means of
expansions in the vector spherical harmonics. The ICRF3 S/X-band catalog shows a more smooth dependency
on the number of observations than the ICRF1 and ICRF2, while the K and X/Ka-band yield a dependency
discrepancy at the number of observations of about 50. The rotation of all ICRF catalogs show consistent
results, except for the X-component of the X/Ka-band which arises from the positional error in the
non-defining sources. No significant glides were found between the ICRF3 S/X-band component and
Gaia DR2. However, the K- and X/Ka- band frames show a dipolar deformation in Y-component of +50{\mu}as
and several quadrupolar terms of 50{\mu}as in an absolute sense. A significant glide along Z-axis
exceeding 200 {\mu}as in the X/Ka-band was also reported. These systematics in the ICRF catalog
are shown to be less dependent on the limiting magnitude of the Gaia sample when the number of common
sources is sufficient (> 100). The ICRF3 S/X-band catalog shows improved accuracy and systematics
at the level of noise floor. But the zonal errors in the X/Ka-band should be noted, especially in the
context of comparisons of multi-frequency positions for individual sources.
