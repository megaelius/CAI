In recent years evidence has been building that planet formation starts early, in the first $\sim$
0.5 Myr. Studying the dust masses available in young disks enables understanding the origin of planetary
systems since mature disks are lacking the solid material necessary to reproduce the observed exoplanetary
systems, especially the massive ones. We aim to determine if disks in the embedded stage of star formation
contain enough dust to explain the solid content of the most massive exoplanets. We use Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 observations of embedded disks in the Perseus star-forming
region together with Very Large Array (VLA) Ka-band (9 mm) data to provide a robust estimate of dust
disk masses from the flux densities. Using the DIANA opacity model including large grains, with
a dust opacity value of $\kappa_{\rm 9\ mm}$ = 0.28 cm$^{2}$ g$^{-1}$, the median dust masses of the
embedded disks in Perseus are 158 M$_\oplus$ for Class 0 and 52 M$_\oplus$ for Class I from the VLA
fluxes. The lower limits on the median masses from ALMA fluxes are 47 M$_\oplus$ and 12 M$_\oplus$
for Class 0 and Class I, respectively, obtained using the maximum dust opacity value $\kappa_{\rm
1.3mm}$ = 2.3 cm$^{2}$ g$^{-1}$. The dust masses of young Class 0 and I disks are larger by at least
a factor of 10 and 3, respectively, compared with dust masses inferred for Class II disks in Lupus
and other regions. The dust masses of Class 0 and I disks in Perseus derived from the VLA data are high
enough to produce the observed exoplanet systems with efficiencies acceptable by planet formation
models: the solid content in observed giant exoplanets can be explained if planet formation starts
in Class 0 phase with an efficiency of $\sim$ 15%. Higher efficiency of $\sim$ 30% is necessary if
the planet formation is set to start in Class I disks.
