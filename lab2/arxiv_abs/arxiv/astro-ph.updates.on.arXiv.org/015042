Several thousand core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) of different flavors have been discovered
so far. However, identifying their progenitors has remained an outstanding open question in astrophysics.
Studies of SN host galaxies have proven to be powerful in providing constraints on the progenitor
populations. In this paper, we present all CCSNe detected between 2009 and 2017 by the Palomar Transient
Factory. This sample includes 888 SNe of 12 distinct classes out to redshift $z\approx1$. We present
the photometric properties of their host galaxies from the far-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared
and model the host-galaxy spectral energy distributions to derive physical properties. The galaxy
mass functions of Type Ic, Ib, IIb, II, and IIn SNe ranges from $10^{5}$ to $10^{11.5}~M_\odot$,
probing the entire mass range of star-forming galaxies down to the least-massive star-forming
galaxies known. Moreover, the galaxy mass distributions are consistent with models of star-formation-weighted
mass functions. Regular CCSNe are hence direct tracers of star formation. Small but notable differences
exist between some of the SN classes. Type Ib/c SNe prefer galaxies with slightly higher masses (i.e.,
higher metallicities) and star-formation rates than Type IIb and II SNe. These differences are
less pronounced than previously thought. H-poor SLSNe and SNe~Ic-BL are scarce in galaxies above
$10^{10}~M_\odot$. Their progenitors require environments with metallicities of $<0.4$ and
$<1$ solar, respectively. In addition, the hosts of H-poor SLSNe are dominated by a younger stellar
population than all other classes of CCSNe. Our findings corroborate the notion that low-metallicity
\textit{and} young age play an important role in the formation of SLSN progenitors.
