We present the X-ray source catalog for the 479 ks Chandra exposure of the SDSS J1030+0524 field,
that is centered on a region that shows the best evidence to date of an overdensity around a z > 6 quasar,
and also includes a galaxy overdensity around a Compton-thick Fanaroff-Riley type II radio galaxy
at z = 1.7. Using wavdetect for initial source detection and ACIS Extract for source photometry and
significance assessment, we create preliminary catalogs of sources that are detected in the full,
soft, and hard bands, respectively. We produce X-ray simulations that mirror our Chandra observation
to filter our preliminary catalogs and get a completeness level of > 91% and a reliability level of
95% in each band. The catalogs in the three bands are then matched into a final main catalog of 256 unique
sources. Among them, 244, 193, and 208 are detected in the full, soft, and hard bands, respectively.
This makes J1030 field the fifth deepest extragalactic X-ray survey to date. The field is part of
the Multiwavelength Survey by Yale-Chile (MUSYC), and is also covered by optical imaging data from
the Large Binocular Camera (LBC) at the Large Binocular Telescope, near-IR imaging data from the
Canada France Hawaii Telescope WIRCam, and Spitzer IRAC. Thanks to its dense multi-wavelength
coverage, J1030 represents a legacy field for the study of large-scale structures around distant
accreting supermassive black holes. Using a likelihood ratio analysis, we associate multi-band
counterparts for 252 (98.4%) of the 256 Chandra sources, with an estimated reliability of 95%. Finally,
we compute the cumulative number of sources in each X-ray band, finding that they are in general agreement
with the results from the Chandra Deep Fields.
