Context: NASA recently announced an extended mission for TESS. As a result it is expected that the
southern ecliptic hemisphere will be re-observed approximately two years after the initial survey.
Aims: We aim to explore how TESS re-observing the southern ecliptic hemisphere will impact the number
and distribution of mono-transits discovered during the first year of observations. This simulation
will be able to be scaled to any future TESS re-observations. Methods: We carry out an updated simulation
of TESS detections in the southern ecliptic hemisphere. This simulation includes realistic Sector
window-functions based on the first 11 sectors of SPOC 2 min SAP lightcurves. We then extend this
simulation to cover the expected Year 4 of the mission when TESS will re-observed the southern ecliptic
fields. For recovered monotransits we also look at the possibility of predicting the period based
on the coverage in the TESS data. Results: We find an updated prediction of 339 monotransits from
the TESS Year 1 southern ecliptic hemisphere, and that approximately 80% of these systems (266/339)
will transit again in the Year 4 observations. The Year 4 observations will also contribute new monotransits
not seen in Year 1, resulting in a total of 149 monotransits from the combined Year 1 and Year 4 data
sets. We find that 75% (189/266) of recovered Year 1 monotransits will only transit once in the Year
4 data set. For these systems we will be able to constrain possible periods, but period aliasing due
to the large time gap between Year 1 and Year 4 observations means that the true period will remain
unknown with further spectroscopic or photometric follow-up.
