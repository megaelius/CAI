We present a catalogue of 2135 galaxy redshifts from the VLT LBG Redshift Survey (VLRS), a spectroscopic
survey of z ~ 3 galaxies in wide fields centred on background quasi-stellar objects. We have used
deep optical imaging to select galaxies via the Lyman-break technique. Spectroscopy of the Lyman-break
galaxies (LBGs) was then made using the Visible Multi-Object Spectrograph (VIMOS), giving a mean
redshift of z=2.79. We analyse the clustering properties of the VLRS sample and also of the VLRS sample
combined with the smaller area Keck-based survey of Steidel et al. From the semiprojected correlation
function, wp({\sigma}) we find that the results are well fit with a single power-law model, with
clustering scale lengths of r0=3.46+-0.41 and 3.83+-0.24 Mpc/h, respectively. We note that the
corresponding combined {\xi}(r) slope is flatter than for local galaxies at {\gamma} = 1.5-1.6
rather than {\gamma}=1.8. This flat slope is confirmed by the z-space correlation function, {\xi}(s),
and in the range 10<s<100 Mpc/h the VLRS shows ~2.5{\sigma} excess over the {\Lambda} cold
dark matter. This excess may be consistent with recent evidence for non-Gaussianity in clustering
results at z~1. We then analyse the LBG z-space distortions using the 2D correlation function, {\xi}({\sigma},
{\pi}), finding for the combined sample a large-scale infall parameter of $\beta$ = 0.38+-0.19
and a velocity dispersion of 420km/s. Based on our measured {\beta}, we are able to determine the
gravitational growth rate, finding a value of f(z = 3)=0.99+-0.50 (or f{\sigma}8 = 0.26+-0.13),
which is the highest redshift measurement of the growth rate via galaxy clustering and is consistent
with {\Lambda}CDM. Finally, we constrain the mean halo mass for the LBG population, finding that
the VLRS and combined sample suggest mean halo masses of log(MDM/Msun) = 11.57+-0.15 and 11.73+-0.07,
respectively.
