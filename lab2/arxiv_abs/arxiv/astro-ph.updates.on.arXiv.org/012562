Cosmic Dawn ("CoDa") II yields the first statistically-meaningful determination of the relative
contribution to reionization by galaxies of different halo mass, from a fully-coupled radiation-hydrodynamics
simulation of the epoch of reionization large enough ($\sim 100$ Mpc) to model global reionization
while resolving the formation of all galactic halos above $\sim 10^8 \msol$. Cell transmission
inside high-mass haloes is bi-modal -- ionized cells are transparent, while neutral cells absorb
the photons their stars produce - and the halo escape fraction $ \fesc$ reflects the balance of star
formation rate ("SFR") between these modes. The latter is increasingly prevalent at higher halo
mass, driving down $\fesc$ (we provide analytical fits to our results), whereas halo escape luminosity,
proportional to $\fesc \times {\rm SFR}$, increases with mass. Haloes with dark matter masses within
$6\cdot 10^{8} \msol < \mh < 3\cdot 10^{10} \msol$ produce $\sim 80$% of the escaping photons at z=7,
when the Universe is 50% ionized, making them the main drivers of cosmic reionization. Less massive
haloes, though more numerous, have low SFRs and contribute less than 10% of the photon budget then,
despite their high $\fesc$. High mass haloes are too few and too opaque, contributing $<10$% despite
their high SFRs. The dominant mass range is lower (higher) at higher (lower) redshift, as mass function
and reionization advance together (e.g. at z$=8.5$, x$_{\rm HI}=0.9$, $\mh < 5.10^9 \msol$ haloes
contributed $\sim 80$%). Galaxies with UV magnitudes $M_{AB1600}$ between $-12$ and $-19$ dominated
reionization between z$=6$ and 8.
