We investigate the role of mass infall in the formation and evolution of protostars. To avoid ad hoc
initial and boundary conditions, we consider the infall resulting self-consistently from modeling
the formation of stellar clusters in turbulent molecular clouds. We show that protostellar infall
rates in turbulent clouds are always comparable to or larger than observed accretion rates, and
thus cannot be neglected in modeling the luminosity of protostars and the evolution of disks, even
after the embedded phase of protostars. We find large variations of infall rates from protostar
to protostar, and large fluctuations during the evolution of individuals protostars. In most cases,
the accretion rate is initially of order 10$^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, and may either decay
rapidly in the formation of low-mass stars, or remain relatively large when more massive stars are
formed. The simulation reproduces well the observed characteristic values and scatter of protostellar
luminosities and matches the observed protostellar luminosity function. The luminosity problem
is therefore solved once realistic protostellar infall histories are accounted for, with no need
for extreme accretion episodes. These results are based on a simulation of randomly-driven magneto-hydrodynamic
turbulence on a scale of 4 pc, including self-gravity, adaptive-mesh refinement to a resolution
of 50 AU, and accreting sink particles. The simulation yields a low star formation rate, consistent
with the observations, and a mass distribution of sink particles consistent with the observed stellar
initial mass function during the whole duration of the simulation, forming nearly 1,300 sink particles
over 3.2 Myr.
