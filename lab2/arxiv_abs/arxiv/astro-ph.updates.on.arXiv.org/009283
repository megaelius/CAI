The observational study of stars in the sub-millimetre regime has only rather recently begun and
was made possible mainly by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The emission
mechanisms of this radiation from normal MS stars and its physical significance for the outer atmospheric
layers is the topic of intense contemporary study. Our previous ALMA observations of the alpha Centauri
binary system detected the submm emission originating in the chromospheres of these solar-type
stars. Observations at another epoch are aiming at further characterising these atmospheric layers
and their behaviour with time. The comparison of data from two epochs should present the basis for
more advanced theoretical modelling. In Cycle 4, both stars were again detected in the same bands
as in the earlier Cycle 2. These early data suggested a flattening of the SED towards longer wavelengths.
Now, the SEDs exhibit a single spectral slope over the entire frequency range (90 to 675 GHz). The
SEDs from Cycle 4 can be fit by power laws of the form S(f)~f^a with a=1.76+/-0.01 for alpha Cen A and
a=1.71+/-0.02 for alpha Cen B. In addition, we were aiming at clarifying the status of the recently
discovered U source and its relation to the alpha Cen system. Proper motion data of the U source should
establish its relation to the alpha Cen system, and the submm SED of U should provide information
about its physical nature. For the U source, the upper limits on its proper motion are much smaller
than the pm of alpha Cen, which essentially excludes any physical relationship with the binary.
For the the ALMA-SED of U applies a=2.55+/-0.14. If this emission from U is due to dust, its opacity
exponent b=a-2 would be about 0.5, indicative of particle sizes that are larger than those of the
interstellar medium, where b(ISM)~2), but comparable to those found in circumstellar discs.
