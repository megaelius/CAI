Cosmic ray (CR) electrons reveal key insights into the non-thermal physics of the interstellar
medium, galaxies, galaxy clusters, and active galactic nuclei by means of their inverse Compton
{\gamma}-ray emission and synchrotron emission in magnetic fields. While magnetohydrodynamical
(MHD) simulations with CR protons capture their dynamical impact on these systems, only few computational
studies include CR electron physics because of the short cooling time-scales and complex hysteresis
effects, which require a numerically expensive, high-resolution spectral treatment. Since CR
electrons produce important non-thermal observational signatures, such a spectral CR electron
treatment is important to link MHD simulations to observations. We present an efficient post-processing
code for Cosmic Ray Electron Spectra that are evolved in Time (CREST) on Lagrangian tracer particles.
The CR electron spectra are very accurately evolved on comparably large MHD time steps owing to an
innovative hybrid numerical-analytical scheme. CREST is coupled to the cosmological MHD code
AREPO and treats all important aspects of spectral CR electron evolution such as adiabatic expansion
and compression, Coulomb losses, radiative losses in form of inverse Compton, bremsstrahlung
and synchrotron processes, diffusive shock acceleration and reacceleration, and Fermi-II reacceleration.
After showing various code validations of idealized one-zone simulations, we study the coupling
of CREST to MHD simulations. We demonstrate that the CR electron spectra are efficiently and accurately
evolved in shock-tube and Sedov-Taylor blast wave simulations. This opens up the possibility to
produce self-consistent synthetic observables of non-thermal emission processes in various
astrophysical environments.
