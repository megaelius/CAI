Just as in any other profession, astronomers have an obligation to reduce their carbon footprint
to meet the necessary global requirements for limiting the effects of climate change. In this white
paper, we estimate that Australian astronomers' total greenhouse gas emissions from their regular
work activities are >~15 ktCO_2-e/yr (equivalent kilotonnes of carbon dioxide per year). This
can be broken into 4.3 +/- 1.1 ktCO_2-e/yr from flights, ~6.8 ktCO_2-e/yr from supercomputer usage,
~1.8 ktCO_2-e/yr from powering office buildings, and ~2 ktCO_2-e/yr from the operation of the Murchison
Radio Observatory (with other observatories unaccounted for here that would add to this number).
Split across faculty scientists, postdoctoral researchers, and PhD students, this averages to
>~19 tCO_2-e/yr per astronomer. We outline steps astronomers can take to reduce their emissions
from these environmentally unsustainable practices. (1) We should exclusively use supercomputers
and observatories that are powered predominantly by renewable energy sources. Where facilities
that we currently use are unsatisfactory, they should be lobbied to invest in renewables, such as
solar or wind farms. Emphasis must also be placed on code efficiency for projects that consume millions
of CPU core-hours. (2) Air travel should be reduced wherever possible, replaced primarily by video
conferencing. We emphasise that while carbon offsetting should be mandatory for all 'unavoidable'
travel, it does not negate carbon emissions, and hence does not justify flights. Based on an ICRAR-UWA
case study, senior scientists have the greatest responsibility to reduce flying, as they generate
~70% more emissions per person from flying than postdocs, and more than triple that of PhD students,
on average. (3) A sustainability chapter and award should be established by the Astronomical Society
of Australia.
