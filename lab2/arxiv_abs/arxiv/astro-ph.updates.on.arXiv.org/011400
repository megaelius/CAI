Dust plays an important role in shaping a galaxy's spectral energy distribution (SED). It absorbs
ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR) radiation and re-emits this energy in the far-infrared
(FIR). The FIR is essential to understand dust in galaxies. However, deep FIR observations require
a space mission, none of which are still active today. We aim to infer the FIR emission across six Herschel
bands, along with dust luminosity, mass, and effective temperature, based on the available UV to
mid-infrared (MIR) observations. We also want to estimate the uncertainties of these predictions,
compare our method to energy balance SED fitting, and determine possible limitations of the model.
We propose a machine learning framework to predict the FIR fluxes from 14 UV-MIR broadband fluxes.
We used a low redshift sample by combining DustPedia and H-ATLAS, and extracted Bayesian flux posteriors
through SED fitting. We trained shallow neural networks to predict the far-infrared fluxes, uncertainties,
and dust properties. We evaluated them on a test set using a root mean square error (RMSE) in log-space.
Our results (RMSE = 0.19 dex) significantly outperform UV-MIR energy balance SED fitting (RMSE
= 0.38 dex), and are inherently unbiased. We can identify when the predictions are off, for example
when the input has large uncertainties on WISE 22, or when the input does not resemble the training
set. The galaxies for which we have UV-FIR observations can be used as a blueprint for galaxies that
lack FIR data. This results in a 'virtual FIR telescope', which can be applied to large optical-MIR
galaxy samples. This helps bridge the gap until the next FIR mission.
