Massive stars in binaries can give rise to extreme phenomena such as X-ray binaries and gravitational
wave sources after one or both stars end their lives as core-collapse supernovae. Stars in close
orbit around a stellar or compact companion are expected to explode as "stripped-envelope supernovae",
showing no (Type Ib/c) or little (Type IIb) signs of hydrogen in the spectra, because hydrogen-rich
progenitors are too large to fit. The physical processes responsible for the stripping process
and the fate of the companion are still very poorly understood. Aiming to find new clues, we investigate
Cas~A, which is a very young ($\sim$340 \,yr) and near ($\sim$3.4\,kpc) remnant of a core collapse
supernova. Cas~A has been subject to several searches for possible companions, all unsuccessfully.
We present new measurements of the proper motions and photometry of stars in the vicinity based on
deep HST ACS/WFC and WFC3-IR data. We identify stellar sources that are close enough in projection,
but using their proper motions we show that none are compatible with being at the location of center
at the time of explosion, in agreement with earlier findings. Our photometric measurements allow
us to place much deeper (order of magnitude) upper limits on the brightness of possible undetected
companions. We systematically compare them with model predictions for a wide variety of scenarios.
We can confidently rule out the presence of any stellar companion of any reasonable mass and age (main
sequence, pre main sequence or stripped). Although this finding is not in direct conflict with model
predictions, it does rule out what many considered to be the most likely evolutionary scenario for
type IIb supernova. (abstract abbreviated)
