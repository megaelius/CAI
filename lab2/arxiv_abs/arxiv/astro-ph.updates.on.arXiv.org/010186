We explore X-ray evidence for the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the two most actively
star-forming Green Pea galaxies (GPs), SDSS J0749+3337 and SDSS J0822+2241, which have star-formation
rates (SFRs) of $123~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and $78~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. The GPs have
red mid-infrared (MIR) spectral energy distributions and higher 22 $\mu$m luminosities than expected
from a proxy of the SFR (H$\alpha$ luminosity), consistent with hosting AGNs with 2-10 keV luminosities
of $\sim10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We thus obtain and analyze the first hard ($>$ 10 keV) X-ray data observed
with NuSTAR and archival XMM-Newton data below 10 keV. From the NuSTAR $\approx$20 ksec data, however,
we find no significant hard X-ray emission. By contrast, soft X-ray emission with 0.5--8 keV luminosities
of $\approx10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ is significantly detected in both targets, which can be explained
only by star formation (SF). A possible reason for the lack of clear evidence is that a putative AGN
torus absorbs most of the X-ray emission. Applying a smooth-density AGN torus model, we determine
minimum hydrogen column densities along the equatorial plane ($N_{\rm H}^{\rm eq}$) consistent
with the non-detection. The results indicate $N_{\rm H}^{\rm eq} \gtrsim 2\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$
for SDSS J0749+3337 and $N_{\rm H}^{\rm eq} \gtrsim 5\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$ for SDSS J0822+2241.
Therefore, the GPs may host such heavily obscured AGNs. Otherwise, no AGN exists and the MIR emission
is ascribed to SF. Active SF in low-mass galaxies is indeed suggested to reproduce red MIR colors.
This would imply that diagnostics based on MIR photometry data alone may misidentify such galaxies
as AGNs.
