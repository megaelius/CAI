We study a complex GOES M1.1 circular ribbon flare and related pre-flare activity on 26 January 2015
[SOL26-01-2015] in solar active region NOAA 12268. This flare activity was observed by the AIA on
board SDO and the RHESSI. The examination of photospheric magnetograms during the extended period,
prior to the event, suggests the successive development of a so-called 'anemone' type magnetic
configuration. NLFFF extrapolation reveals a fan-spine magnetic configuration with the presence
of a coronal null-point. We found that the pre-flare activity in the active region starts ~15 min
prior to the main flare in the form of localized bright patches at two locations. A comparison of locations
and spatial structures of the pre-flare activity with magnetic configuration of the corresponding
region suggests onset of magnetic reconnection at the null-point along with the low-atmosphere
magnetic reconnection caused by the emergence and the cancellation of the magnetic flux. The main
flare of M1.1 class is characterized by the formation of a well-developed circular ribbon along
with a region of remote brightening. Remarkably, a set of relatively compact parallel ribbons formed
inside the periphery of the circular ribbon which developed lateral to the brightest part of the
circular ribbon. During the peak phase of the flare, a coronal jet is observed at the north-east edge
of the circular ribbon which suggests interchange reconnection between large-scale field lines
and low-lying closed field lines. Our investigation suggests a combination of two distinct processes
in which ongoing pre-flare null-point reconnection gets further intensified as the confined eruption
along with jet activity proceeded from within the circular ribbon region which results to the formation
of inner parallel ribbons and corresponding post-reconnection arcade.
