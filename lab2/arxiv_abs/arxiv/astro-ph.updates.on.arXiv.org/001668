Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler is widely used for cosmological parameter estimation from
CMB and other data. However, due to the intrinsic serial nature of the MCMC sampler, convergence
is often very slow. Here we present a fast and independently written Monte Carlo method for cosmological
parameter estimation named as Slick Cosmological Parameter Estimator (SCoPE), that employs delayed
rejection to increase the acceptance rate of a chain, and pre-fetching that helps an individual
chain to run on parallel CPUs. An inter-chain covariance update is also incorporated to prevent
clustering of the chains allowing faster and better mixing of the chains. We use an adaptive method
for covariance calculation to calculate and update the covariance automatically as the chains
progress. Our analysis shows that the acceptance probability of each step in SCoPE is more than $95\%$
and the convergence of the chains are faster. Using SCoPE, we carry out some cosmological parameter
estimations with different cosmological models using WMAP-9 and Planck results. One of the current
research interests in cosmology is quantifying the nature of dark energy. We analyze the cosmological
parameters from two illustrative commonly used parameterisations of dark energy models. We also
asses primordial helium fraction in the universe can be constrained by the present CMB data from
WMAP-9 and Planck. The results from our MCMC analysis on the one hand helps us to understand the workability
of the SCoPE better, on the other hand it provides a completely independent estimation of cosmological
parameters from WMAP-9 and Planck data.
