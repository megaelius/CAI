X-ray emissions from cometary atmospheres were modeled from first principles using charge-exchange
interaction with solar wind ions as well as coherent scattering of solar X-rays from dust and ice
grains. Scattering cross sections were interpolated over the 1 nm - 1 cm grain radius range using
approximations based on the optically thin or thick nature of grains with different sizes. The theoretical
emission model was compared to Chandra observations of Comets ISON and Ikeya-Zhang due to their
high signal-to-noise ratios and clearly defined spectral features. Comparing the observed intensities
to the model showed that the charge-exchange mechanism accurately reproduced the emission spectra
below 1 keV while dust and ice scattering was negligible. Examining the 1-2 keV range found dust and
ice scattering emissions to agree well with observations while charge-exchange contributions
were insignificant. Spectral features between the scattering model and observations also trended
similarly over the 1-2 keV range. The dust and ice density within the cometary atmosphere $n$ was
varied with respect to grain size $a$ as the function $n(a) \propto a^{-\alpha}$, with Ikeya-Zhang
requiring $\alpha = 2.5$ and ISON requiring $\alpha = 2.2$ to best fit the observed spectral intensities.
These grain size dependences agreed with independent observations and simulations of such systems.
The overall findings demonstrate evidence of significant scattering emissions present above
1 keV in the analyzed cometary emission spectra and that dust/ice density dependence on grain radius
$a$ may vary significantly between comets.
