We investigate the structure and nuclear region of the black hole (BH) hosting galaxy Henize2-10.
Surface brightness (SB) profiles are analyzed using Magellan/Megacam $g$- and $r$-band images.
Excluding the central starburst, we find a best-fit two component S\'ersic profile with $n_{\rm
in} \sim 0.6$, $r_{\text{eff,in}} \sim$ 260~pc, and $n_{\rm out}\sim 1.8$, $r_{\text{eff, out}}\sim$
1 kpc. Integrating out to our outer most data point (100 arc sec $\sim$ 4.3 kpc), we calculate $M_g=-19.2$
and $M_r=-19.8$. The corresponding enclosed stellar mass is $M_{\star}\sim(10\pm3)\times10^9$
M$_\odot$, $\sim3\times$ larger than previous estimates. Apart from the central $\lesssim$500
pc, with blue colors and an irregular morphology, the galaxy appears to be an early-type system.
The outer color is quite red, $(g-r)_0=0.75$, suggesting a dominant old population. We study the
nuclear region of the galaxy using archival Gemini/NIFS $K$-band adaptive optics spectroscopy
and {\it Hubble Space Telescope} imaging. We place an upper limit on the BH mass of $\sim10^7M_{\odot}$
from the NIFS data, consistent with that from the $M_{\rm BH}$-radio-X-ray fundamental plane.
No coronal lines are seen, but a Br$\gamma$ source is located at the position of the BH with a luminosity
consistent with the X-ray emission. The starburst at the center of Henize 2-10 has led to the formation
of several super star clusters, which are within $\sim$100 pc of the BH. We examine the fate of the
nucleus by estimating the dynamical masses and dynamical friction timescales of the clusters.
The most massive clusters ($\sim 10^6 M_\odot$) have $\tau_{\rm dyn} \lesssim 200$ Myr, and thus
Henize 2-10 may represent a rare snapshot of nuclear star cluster formation around a pre-existing
massive BH.
