The cosmic-ray (CR) accelerator at the galactic centre (GC) is not yet established by current observations.
Here we investigate the radiative-inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) of Sagittarius A* (SgrA*)
as a CR accelerator assuming acceleration by turbulent magnetic reconnection, and derive possible
emission fluxes of CRs interacting within the RIAF (the central $\sim10^{13}$cm). The target environment
of the RIAF is modelled with numerical, general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics (GRMHD) together
with leptonic radiative transfer simulations. The acceleration of the CRs is not computed here.
Instead, we inject CRs constrained by the magnetic reconnection power of the accretion flow and
compute the emission/absorption of $\gamma$-rays due to these CRs interacting with the RIAF, through
Monte Carlo simulations employing the {\tt CRPropa 3} code. The resulting very-high-energy (VHE)
fluxes are not expected to reproduce the point source HESS J1745-290 as the emission of this source
is most likely produced at pc scales. The emission profiles derived here intend to trace the VHE signatures
of the RIAF as a CR accelerator and provide predictions for observations of the GC with improved angular
resolution and differential flux sensitivity as those of the forthcoming Cherenkov Telescope
Array (CTA). Within the scenario presented here, we find that for mass accretion rates $\gtrsim
10^{-7}$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$, the RIAF of SgrA* produces VHE fluxes which are consistent with the
H.E.S.S. upper limits for the GC and potentially observable by the future CTA. The associated neutrino
fluxes are negligible compared with the diffuse neutrino emission measured by the IceCube.
