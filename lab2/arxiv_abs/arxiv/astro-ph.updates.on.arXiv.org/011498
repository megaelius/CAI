The past two decades have seen dramatic progress in our knowledge of the population of young stars
of age $< 200\,$Myr that lie within $150\,$pc of the Sun. These nearby, young stars, most of which
are found in loose, comoving groups, provide the opportunity to explore (among many other things)
the dissolution of stellar clusters and their diffusion into the field star population. Here, we
exploit the combination of astrometric and photometric data from {\it Gaia} and photometric data
from GALEX (UV) and 2MASS (near-IR) in an attempt to identify additional nearby, young, late-type
stars. Specifically, we present a sample of 146 GALEX UV-selected late-type (predominantly K-type)
field stars with {\it Gaia}-based distances $< 125\,$pc (based on {\it Gaia} Data Release 1) that
have isochronal ages $< 80\,$Myr even if equal-components binaries. We investigate the spectroscopic
and kinematic properties of this sample. Despite their young isochronal ages, only $\sim 10$ per
cent) of stars among this sample can be confidently associated with established nearby, young moving
groups (MGs). These candidate MG members include 5 stars newly identified in this study. The vast
majority of our sample of 146 nearby young star candidates have anomalous kinematics relative to
the known MGs. These stars may hence represent a previously unrecognised population of young stars
that has recently mixed into the older field star population. We discuss the implications and caveats
of such a hypothesis---including the intriguing fact that, in addition to their non-young-star-like
kinematics, the majority of the UV-selected, isochronally young field stars within $50\,$pc appear
surprisingly X-ray faint.
