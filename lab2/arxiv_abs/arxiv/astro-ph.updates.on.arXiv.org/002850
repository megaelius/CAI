The (Zeeman-)Doppler imaging studies of solar-type stars very often reveal large high-latitude
spots. This also includes F stars that possess relatively shallow convection zones, indicating
that the dynamo operating in these stars differs from the solar dynamo. We aim to determine whether
mean-field dynamo models of late-F type dwarf stars can reproduce the surface features recovered
in Doppler maps. In particular, we wish to test whether the models can reproduce the high-latitude
spots observed on some F dwarfs. The photometric inversions and the surface temperature maps of
AF Lep were obtained using the Occamian-approach inversion technique. Low signal-to-noise spectroscopic
data were improved by applying the least-squares deconvolution method. The locations of strong
magnetic flux in the stellar tachocline as well as the surface fields obtained from mean-field dynamo
solutions were compared with the observed surface temperature maps. The photometric record of
AF Lep reveals both long- and short-term variability. However, the current data set is too short
for cycle-length estimates. From the photometry, we have determined the rotation period of the
star to be 0.9660+-0.0023 days. The surface temperature maps show a dominant, but evolving, high-latitude
(around +65 degrees) spot. Detailed study of the photometry reveals that sometimes the spot coverage
varies only marginally over a long time, and at other times it varies rapidly. Of a suite of dynamo
models, the model with a radiative interior rotating as fast as the convection zone at the equator
delivered the highest compatibility with the obtained Doppler images.
