Post-Noachian Martian paleochannels indicate the existence of liquid water on the surface of Mars
after about 3.5 Gya (Irwin et al., 2015; Palucis et al., 2016). In order to explore the effects of variations
in CO$_{2}$ partial pressure and obliquity on the possibility of surface water, we created a zero-dimensional
surface energy balance model. We combine this model with physically consistent orbital histories
to track conditions over the last 3.5 Gyr of Martian history. We find that melting is allowed for atmospheric
pressures corresponding to exponential loss rates of $dP/dt \propto t^{-3.73}$ or faster, but
this rate is within $0.5 \sigma$ of the rate calculated from initial measurements made by the Mars
Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission, if we assume all the escaping oxygen measured
by MAVEN comes from atmospheric CO$_{2}$ (Lillis et al., 2017; Tu et al., 2015). Melting at this loss
rate matches selected key geologic constraints on the formation of Hesperian river networks, assuming
optimal melt conditions during the warmest part of each Mars year (Irwin et al., 2015; Stopar et al.,
2006; Kite et al., 2017a,b). The atmospheric pressure has a larger effect on the surface energy than
changes in Mars's mean obliquity. These results show that initial measurements of atmosphere loss
by MAVEN are consistent with atmospheric loss being the dominant process that switched Mars from
a melt-permitting to a melt-absent climate (Jakosky et al., 2017), but non-CO$_{2}$ warming will
be required if $<2$ Gya paleochannels are confirmed, or if most of the escaping oxygen measured by
MAVEN comes from H$_{2}$O.
