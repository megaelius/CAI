Thermal, orbital, and rotational dynamics of tidally loaded exoplanets are interconnected by
intricate feedback. The rheological structure of the planet determines its susceptibility to
tidal deformation and, as a consequence, participates in shaping its orbit. The orbital parameters
and the spin state, conversely, control the rate of tidal dissipation and may lead to substantial
changes of the interior. We investigate the coupled thermal-orbital evolution of differentiated
rocky exoplanets governed by the Andrade viscoelastic rheology. The coupled evolution is treated
by a semi-analytical model, 1d parametrized heat transfer and self-consistently calculated tidal
dissipation. First, we conduct several parametric studies, exploring the effect of the rheological
properties, the planet's size, and the orbital eccentricity on the tidal locking and dissipation.
These tests show that the role of tidal locking into high spin-orbit resonances is most prominent
on low eccentric orbits, where it results in substantially higher tidal heating than the synchronous
rotation. Second, we calculate the long-term evolution of three currently known low-mass exoplanets
with nonzero orbital eccentricity and absent or yet unknown eccentricity forcing (namely GJ 625
b, GJ 411 b, and Proxima Centauri b). The tidal model incorporates the formation of a stable magma
ocean and a consistently evolving spin rate. We find that the thermal state is strongly affected
by the evolution of eccentricity and spin state and proceeds as a sequence of thermal equilibria.
Final despinning into synchronous rotation slows down the orbital evolution and helps to maintain
long-term stable orbital eccentricity.
