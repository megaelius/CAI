A new compilation of $120$ angular-size/redshift data for compact radio quasars from very-long-baseline
interferometry (VLBI) surveys motivates us to revisit the interaction between dark energy and
dark matter with these probes reaching high redshifts $z\sim 3.0$. In this paper, we investigate
observational constraints on different phenomenological interacting dark energy (IDE) models
with the intermediate-luminosity radio quasars acting as individual standard rulers, combined
with the newest BAO and CMB observation from Planck results acting as statistical rulers. The results
obtained from the MCMC method and other statistical methods including Figure of Merit and Information
Criteria show that: (1) Compared with the current standard candle data and standard clock data,
the intermediate-luminosity radio quasar standard rulers , probing much higher redshifts, could
provide comparable constraints on different IDE scenarios. (2) The interaction between dark energy
and dark matter seems to be vanishing or slightly smaller than zero. At the 68.3\% confidence level,
the energy is seen transferred from dark matter to dark energy, which implies that those IDE models
can not alleviate the coincidence problem or even more sever. However, the strong degeneracies
between the interaction term and Hubble constant may contribute to alleviate the tension of $H_0$
between the recent Planck and HST measurements. (3) Concerning the ranking of competing dark energy
models, IDE with more free parameters are substantially penalized by the BIC criterion, which agrees
very well with the previous results derived from other cosmological probes.
