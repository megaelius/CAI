Solar activity in the past millennia can only be reconstructed from cosmogenic radionuclide records
in terrestrial archives. However, because of the diversity of the proxy archives, it is difficult
to build a homogeneous reconstruction. Here we provide a new consistent multiproxy reconstruction
of the solar activity over the last 9000 years, using available long-span datasets of 10Be and 14C
in terrestrial archives. A new method, based on a Bayesian approach, was applied for the first time
to solar activity reconstruction. A Monte Carlo search for the most probable value of the modulation
potential was performed to match data from different datasets for a given time. We used six 10Be series
from Greenland and Antarctica, and the global 14C production series. The 10Be series were resampled
to match wiggles related to the grand minima in the 14C reference dataset. The GRIP and the EDML 10Be
series diverge from each other during the second half of the Holocene, while the 14C series lies between
them. A likely reason for this is the insufficiently precise beryllium transport and deposition
model for Greenland. A slow 6-millennia variability with lows at ca. 5500 BC and 1500 AD of solar activity
is found. Two components of solar activity can be statistically distinguished: the main 'normal'
component and a component corresponding to grand minima. A possible existence of a component representing
grand maxima is indicated, but it cannot be separated from the main component in a statistically
significant manner. A new consistent reconstruction of solar activity over the last nine millennia
is presented with the most probable values of decadal sunspot numbers and their realistic uncertainties.
Independent components of solar activity corresponding to the main moderate activity and the grand-minimum
state are identified; they may be related to different operation modes of the dynamo.
