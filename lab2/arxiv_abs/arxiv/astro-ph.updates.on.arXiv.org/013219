The properties of hydrogen at high pressure have wide implications in astrophysics and high-pressure
physics. Its phase change in the liquid is variously described as a metallization, H2-dissociation,
density discontinuity or plasma phase transition. It has been tacitly assumed that these phenomena
coincide at a first-order liquid-liquid transition (LLT). In this work, the relevant pressure-temperature
conditions are thoroughly explored with first-principles molecular dynamics. We show there is
a large dependency on exchange-correlation functional and significant finite size effects. We
use hysteresis in a number of measurable quantities to demonstrate a first-order transition up
to a critical point, above which molecular and atomic liquids are indistinguishable. At higher
temperature beyond the critical point, H2-dissociation becomes a smooth cross-over in the supercritical
region that can be modelled by a pseudo-transition, where the H2-2H transformation is localized
and does not cause a density discontinuity at metallization. Thermodynamic anomalies and counter-intuitive
transport behavior of protons are also discovered even far beyond the critical point, making this
dissociative transition highly relevant to the interior dynamics of Jovian planets. Below the
critical point, simulation also reveals a dynamic H2-2H chemical equilibrium with rapid interconversion,
showing that H2 and H are miscible. The predicted critical temperature lies well below the ionization
temperature. Our calculations unequivocally demonstrate that there are three distinct regimes
in the liquid-liquid transition of warm dense hydrogen.
