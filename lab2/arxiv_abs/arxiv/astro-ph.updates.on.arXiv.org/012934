Recent studies of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) in nearby galaxies found that all field disk galaxies
are HI saturated, in that they carry roughly as much HI as permitted before this gas becomes gravitationally
unstable. By taking this HI saturation for granted, the atomic gas fraction $f_{\rm atm}$ of galactic
disks can be predicted as a function of the stability parameter $q=j\sigma/(GM)$, where $M$ and
$j$ are the baryonic mass and specific angular momentum of the disk and $\sigma$ is the HI velocity
dispersion Obreschkow et al. 2016. The log-ratio $\Delta f_q$ between this predictor and the observed
atomic fraction can be seen as a physically motivated `HI deficiency'. While field disk galaxies
have $\Delta f_q \approx0$, objects subject to environmental removal of HI are expected to have
$\Delta f_q>0$. Within this framework, we revisit the HI deficiencies of satellite galaxies in
the Virgo cluster and in clusters of the EAGLE simulation. We find that observed and simulated cluster
galaxies are HI deficient and that $\Delta f_q$ slightly increases when getting closer to the cluster
centres. The $\Delta f_q$ values are similar to traditional HI deficiency estimators, but $\Delta
f_q$ is more directly comparable between observations and simulations than morphology-based
deficiency estimators. By tracking the simulated HI deficient cluster galaxies back in time, we
confirm that $\Delta f_q\approx0$ until the galaxies first enter a halo with $M_{\rm halo}>10^{13}
{\rm M_{\odot}}$, at which moment they quickly lose HI by environmental effects. Finally, we use
the simulation to investigate the links between $\Delta f_q$ and quenching of star formation.
