To achieve a fuller understanding of galaxy evolution, SED fitting can be used to recover quantities
beyond stellar masses (M$_*$) and star formation rates (SFRs). We use Star Formation Histories
(SFHs) reconstructed via the Dense Basis method of Iyer \& Gawiser (2017) for a sample of $17,873$
galaxies at $0.5<z<6$ in the CANDELS GOODS-S field to study the nature and evolution of the SFR-M$_*$
correlation. The reconstructed SFHs represent trajectories in SFR-M$_*$ space, enabling us to
study galaxies at epochs earlier than observed by propagating them backwards in time along these
trajectories. We study the SFR-M$_*$ correlation at $z=1,2,3,4,5,6$ using both direct fits to
galaxies observed at those epochs and SFR-M$_*$ trajectories of galaxies observed at lower redshifts.
The SFR-M$_*$ correlations obtained using the two approaches are found to be consistent with each
other through a KS test. Validation tests using SFHs from semi-analytic models and cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations confirm the sensitivity of the method to changes in the slope, normalization
and shape of the SFR-M$_*$ correlation. This technique allows us to further probe the low-mass regime
of the correlation at high-z by $\sim 1$ dex and over an effective volume of $\sim 10\times$ larger
than possible with just direct fits. We find that the SFR-M$_*$ correlation is consistent with being
linear down to M$_*\sim 10^7 M_\odot$ at $z>4$. The evolution of the correlation is well described
by $\log SFR= (0.80\pm 0.029 - 0.017\pm 0.010\times t_{univ})\log M_*$ $- (6.487\pm 0.282-0.039\pm
0.008\times t_{univ})$, where $t_{univ}$ is the age of the universe in Gyr.
