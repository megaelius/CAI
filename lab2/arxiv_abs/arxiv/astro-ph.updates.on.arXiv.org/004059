Uncertainty quantification is a critical missing component in radio interferometric imaging
that will only become increasingly important as the big-data era of radio interferometry emerges.
Statistical sampling approaches to perform Bayesian inference, like Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) sampling, can in principle recover the full posterior distribution of the image, from which
uncertainties can then be quantified. However, for massive data sizes, like those anticipated
from the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), it will be difficult if not impossible to apply any MCMC technique
due to its inherent computational cost. We formulate Bayesian inference problems with sparsity-promoting
priors (motivated by compressive sensing), for which we recover maximum a posteriori (MAP) point
estimators of radio interferometric images by convex optimisation. Exploiting recent developments
in the theory of probability concentration, we quantify uncertainties by post-processing the
recovered MAP estimate. Three strategies to quantify uncertainties are developed: (i) highest
posterior density credible regions; (ii) local credible intervals (cf. error bars) for individual
pixels and superpixels; and (iii) hypothesis testing of image structure. These forms of uncertainty
quantification provide rich information for analysing radio interferometric observations in
a statistically robust manner. Our MAP-based methods are approximately $10^5$ times faster computationally
than state-of-the-art MCMC methods and, in addition, support highly distributed and parallelised
algorithmic structures. For the first time, our MAP-based techniques provide a means of quantifying
uncertainties for radio interferometric imaging for realistic data volumes and practical use,
and scale to the emerging big-data era of radio astronomy.
