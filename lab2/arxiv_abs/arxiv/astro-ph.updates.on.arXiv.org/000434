AA Tau has been monitored for more than 20 years since 1987, exhibiting a nearly constant brightness
level of V=12.5 mag. We report here that in 2011 it suddenly faded away, becoming 2 magnitudes fainter
in the V-band, and has remained in this deep state since then. We report new optical and near-IR photometry
and spectroscopy obtained during the fading event. The system appears much redder and fainter than
it was in the bright state. Also, the 8.2d photometric period continuously observed for more than
20 years is not seen during most of the deep state. The analysis of the system's brightness and colors
suggests that the visual extinction on the line of sight has increased by about 3-4 magnitudes in
the deep state. At optical wavelengths, the system appears to be dominated by scattered light, probably
originating from the upper surface layers of a highly inclined circumstellar disk. The profiles
of the Balmer lines have significantly changed as well, with the disappearance of a central absorption
component regularly observed in the bright state. We ascribe this change to the scattering of the
system's spectrum by circumstellar dust. Noticeably, the mass accretion rate in the inner disk
and onto the central star has not changed as the system faded away. We conclude that the deepening
of the AA Tau system is due to a sudden increase of circumstellar dust extinction on the line of sight
without concomitant change in the accretion rate. We suggest that the enhanced obscuration may
be produced by a non-axisymmetric overdense region in the disk, located at a distance of 7.7 AU or
more, that was recently brought on the line of sight by its keplerian motion around the central star.
