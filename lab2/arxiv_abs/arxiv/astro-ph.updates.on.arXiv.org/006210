Using high spatial and temporal data from the \emph{Solar Dynamics Observatory} (\emph{SDO})
and the \emph{Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph} (\emph{IRIS}), several observational
signatures of magnetic reconnection in the course of magnetic flux cancellation are presented,
including two loop-loop interaction processes, multiple plasma blob ejections, and a sheet-like
structure that appeared above the flux cancellation sites with a Y-shaped and an inverted Y-shaped
ends. The \emph{IRIS} 1400 \AA\ observations show that the plasma blobs were ejected from the tip
of the Y-shaped ends of the sheet-like structure. Obvious photospheric magnetic flux cancellation
occurred after the first loop-loop interaction and continued until the end of the observation.
Complemented by the nonlinear force-free field extrapolation, we found that two sets of magnetic
field lines, which reveal an X-shaped configuration, align well with the interacted coronal loops.
Moreover, a magnetic null point is found to be situated at about $0.9$ Mm height right above the flux
cancellation sites and located between the two sets of magnetic field lines. These results suggest
that the flux cancellation might be a result of submergence of magnetic field lines following magnetic
reconnection that occurs in the lower atmosphere of the Sun, and the ejected plasma blobs should
be plasmoids created in the sheet-like structure due to the tearing-mode instability. This observation
reveals detailed magnetic field structure and dynamic process above the flux cancellation sites
and will help us to understand magnetic reconnection in the lower atmosphere of the Sun.
