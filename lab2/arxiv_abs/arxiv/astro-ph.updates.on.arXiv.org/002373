The nuclei of merging galaxies are often deeply buried in dense layers of gas and dust. In these regions,
gas outflows driven by starburst and AGN activity are believed to play a crucial role in the evolution
of these galaxies. However, to fully understand this process it is essential to resolve the morphology
and kinematics of such outflows. Using near-IR integral-field spectroscopy obtained with VLT/SINFONI,
we detect a kpc-scale structure of high-velocity molecular hydrogen (H2) gas associated with the
deeply buried secondary nucleus of the IR-luminous merger NGC3256. We show that this structure
is likely the hot component of a molecular outflow, which is detected also in the cold molecular gas
by Sakamoto et al. This outflow, with a molecular gas mass of M(H2)~2x10^7 Msun, is among the first
to be spatially resolved in both the hot H2 gas with VLT/SINFONI and the cold CO-emitting gas with
ALMA. The hot and cold components share a similar morphology and kinematics, with a hot-to-cold
molecular gas mass ratio of ~6x10^-5. The high (~100 pc) resolution at which we map the geometry and
velocity structure of the hot outflow reveals a biconical morphology with opening angle ~40 deg
and gas spread across a FWZI~1200 km/s. Because this collimated outflow is oriented close to the
plane of the sky, the molecular gas may reach maximum intrinsic outflow velocities of ~1800 km/s,
with an average mass outflow rate of at least ~20 Msun/yr. By modeling the line-ratios of various
near-IR H2 transitions, we show that the H2 gas in the outflow is heated through shocks or X-rays to
a temperature of ~1900K. The energy needed to drive the outflow is likely provided by a hidden Compton-thick
AGN or by the nuclear starburst. We show that the global kinematics of the molecular outflow in NGC3256
mimic those of CO-outflows that have been observed at low spatial resolution in starburst- and active
galaxies.
