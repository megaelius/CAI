We present a model for the formation of supermassive stars (SMSs, > 10^3 Msun) during the formation
of globular clusters (GCs) and address the origin of the abundance anomalies in GCs. We assume that
GCs form in converging gas flows and accumulate low-angular momentum gas after a gas cloud has fragmented
into protostars. Accretion of the inflowing gas onto the protostars leads to an adiabatic contraction
of the stellar cluster, resulting in an increase of the stellar collision rate. An SMS can form in
a runaway collision process if the cluster reaches sufficiently high density before two-body heating
driven by SMS-star binaries becomes important and halts the contraction. This condition is met
in clusters with a large number of stars (N>10^6), experiencing a high gas accretion rate (Mdot >
10^5 Msun/Myr), reminiscent of the conditions of GC formation in high-density, gas-rich environments,
such as -- but not restricted to -- the early Universe. The stellar wind of the SMS collides and mixes
with the inflowing pristine gas such that the accreting protostars get polluted by hot-hydrogen
burning yields of the SMS. Because of the continuous rejuvenation of the SMS, the amount of processed
material that is liberated by its wind can be more than an order of magnitude larger than its maximum
mass. This `conveyor belt' production of hot-hydrogen burning products provides a solution to
the mass budget problem that plagues other GC self-enrichment scenarios. Additionally, the material
is mildly enriched in helium and relatively rich in other hot-hydrogen burning products. Finally,
the scaling between the amount of processed material and cluster mass is super-linear, providing
an explanation for the observed increase of the fraction of processed material with GC mass. We discuss
the open questions of this new enrichment scenario and propose observational tests with current
and future facilities.
