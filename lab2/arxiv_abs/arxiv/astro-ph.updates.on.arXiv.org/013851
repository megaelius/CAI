We present a classification of galaxies in the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) 3$\pi$ survey based on their recent
star formation history and morphology. Specifically, we train and test two Random Forest (RF) classifiers
using photometric features (colors and moments) from the PS1 data release 2. Labels for the morphological
classification are taken from Huertas-Company+2011, while labels for the star formation fraction
(SFF) are from the Blanton+2005 catalog. We find that colors provide more predictive accuracy than
photometric moments. We morphologically classify galaxies as either early- or late-type, and
our RF model achieves a 78\% classification accuracy. Our second model classifies galaxies as having
either a low-to-moderate or high SFF. This model achieves an 89\% classification accuracy. We apply
both RF classifiers to the entire PS1 $3\pi$ dataset, allowing us to assign two scores to each PS1
source: $P_\mathrm{HSFF}$, which quantifies the probability of having a high SFF, and $P_\mathrm{spiral}$,
which quantifies the probability of having a late-type morphology. Finally, as a proof of concept,
we apply our classification framework to supernova (SN) host-galaxies from the Zwicky Transient
Factory and the Lick Observatory Supernova Search samples. We show that by selecting on $P_\mathrm{HSFF}$
or $P_\mathrm{spiral}$ it is possible to significantly enhance or suppress the fraction of core-collapse
SNe (or thermonuclear SNe) in the sample with respect to random guessing. This result demonstrates
how contextual information can aid transient classifications at the time of first detection. In
the current era of spectroscopically-starved time-domain astronomy, prompt automated classification
is paramount.
