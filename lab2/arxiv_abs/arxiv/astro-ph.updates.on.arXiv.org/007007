We present a new optical luminosity-HI mass bivariate luminosity function (BLF) based on HI line
observations from the Nancay Interstellar Baryons Legacy Extragalactic Survey (NIBLES). NIBLES
sources lie within the local universe (900 $\leq cz \leq$ 12,000 \kms) and were chosen from SDSS DR5
such that the optical luminosity function was sampled as uniformly as possible. The HI mass function
(HIMF) derived from our raw-data BLF, which is based on HI detections only, is consistent with the
HIMFs derived from other optically selected surveys in that the low-mass slope is flatter than those
derived from blind HI surveys. However, spanning the entire luminosity range of NIBLES, we identify
a highly consistent distribution of the HI gas mass to luminosity ratio (gas-to-light ratio) with
a predictable progression in the mean MHI/Lr ratio as a function of Lr. This consistency allows us
to construct plausible gas-to-light ratio distributions for very low-luminosity bins which lie
outside the NIBLES sample. We also identify a $\sim$ 10% decrease in detection fraction for galaxies
fainter than log(\Lr) = 9.25, consistent with the expected decrease due to distance and sensitivity
effects. Accounting for these trends, we reconstruct plausible gas-to-light distributions spanning
luminosity bins down to log(\Lr) = 5.25, thus producing a corrected BLF. This corrected BLF is in
good qualitative agreement with optical luminosity-HI mass distributions from the ALFALFA survey
and is able to accurately reproduce blind survey HIMFs, lending credibility that this two dimensional
optical luminosity-HI mass distribution is an accurate representation of the volume density distribution
of galaxies in the local universe. We also note that our agreement with HIMFs from other surveys is
dependent on accounting for all systematic differences such as selection method, Hubble constant
and HI flux scale.
