In the high-mass star-forming region G35.20-0.74N, small scale (about 800 AU) chemical segregation
has been observed in which complex organic molecules containing the CN group are located in a small
location. We aim to determine the physical origin of the large abundance difference (about 4 orders
of magnitude) in complex cyanides within G35.20-0.74 B, and we explore variations in age, gas and
dust temperature, and gas density. We performed gas-grain astrochemical modeling experiments
with exponentially increasing (coupled) gas and dust temperature rising from 10 to 500 K at constant
H_2 densities of 10^7, 10^8, and 10^9 cm^{-3}. We tested the effect of varying the initial ice composition,
cosmic-ray ionization rate (1.3x10^{-17}, 1x10^{-16}, and 6x10^{-16} s^{-1}), warm-up time
(over 50, 200, and 1000 kyr), and initial (10, 15, and 25 K) and final temperatures (300 and 500 K).
Varying the initial ice compositions within the observed and expected ranges does not noticeably
affect the modeled abundances indicating that the chemical make-up of hot cores is determined in
the warm-up stage. Complex cyanides vinyl and ethyl cyanide (CH_2CHCN and C_2H_5CN, respectively)
cannot be produced in abundances (versus H_2) greater than 5x10^{-10} for CH_2CHCN and 2x10^{-10}
for C_2H_5CN with a fast warm-up time (52 kyr), while the lower limit for the observed abundance of
C_2H_5CN toward source B3 is 3.4x10^{-10}. Complex cyanide abundances are reduced at higher initial
temperatures and increased at higher cosmic-ray ionization rates. Reproducing the observed abundances
toward G35.20-0.74 Core B3 requires a fast warm-up at a high cosmic-ray ionization rate (1x10^{-16}
s^{-1}) at a high gas density (>10^9 cm^{-3}). G35.20-0.74 source B3 only needs to be about 2000 years
older than B1/B2 for the observed chemical difference to be present. (This abstract has been shortened)
