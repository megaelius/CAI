We consider the possibility that dark energy and baryons might scatter off each other. The type of
interaction we consider leads to a pure momentum exchange, and does not affect the background evolution
of the expansion history. We parametrize this interaction in an effective way at the level of Boltzmann
equations. We compute the effect of dark energy-baryon scattering on cosmological observables,
focusing on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature anisotropy power spectrum and the
matter power spectrum. Surprisingly, we find that even huge dark energy-baryon cross-sections
$\sigma_{xb} \sim {\cal O}({\rm b})$, which are generically excluded by non-cosmological probes
such as collider searches or precision gravity tests, only leave an insignificant imprint on the
observables considered. In the case of the CMB temperature power spectrum, the only imprint consists
in a sub-percent enhancement or depletion of power (depending whether or not the dark energy equation
of state lies above or below $-1$) at very low multipoles, which is thus swamped by cosmic variance.
These effects are explained in terms of differences in how gravitational potentials decay in the
presence of a dark energy-baryon scattering, which ultimately lead to an increase or decrease in
the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe power. Even smaller related effects are imprinted on the
matter power spectrum. The imprints on the CMB are not expected to be degenerate with the effects
due to altering the dark energy sound speed. We conclude that, while strongly appealing, the prospects
for a direct detection of dark energy through cosmology do not seem feasible when considering realistic
dark energy-baryon cross-sections. As a caveat, our results hold to linear order in perturbation
theory.
