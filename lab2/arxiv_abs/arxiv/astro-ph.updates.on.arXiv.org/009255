The formation of the most massive stars in the Universe remains an unsolved problem. Are they able
to form in relative isolation in a manner similar to the formation of solar-type stars, or do they
necessarily require a clustered environment? In order to shed light on this important question,
we study the origin of two very massive stars (VMS): the O2.5If*/WN6 star RFS7 ($\sim$100 $M_{\odot}$),
and the O3.5If* star RFS8 ($\sim$70 $M_{\odot}$), found within $\approx$ 53 and 58 pc respectively
from the Galactic massive young cluster NGC 3603, using Gaia data. RFS7 is found to exhibit motions
resembling a runaway star from NGC 3603. This is now the most massive runaway star candidate known
in the Milky Way. Although RFS8 also appears to move away from the cluster core, it has proper-motion
values that appear inconsistent with being a runaway from NGC 3603 at the $3\sigma$ level (but with
substantial uncertainties due to distance and age). Furthermore, no evidence for a bow-shock or
a cluster was found surrounding RFS8 from available near-infrared photometry. In summary, whilst
RFS7 is likely a runaway star from NGC 3603, making it the first VMS runaway in the Milky Way, RFS8 is
an extremely young ($\sim$2 Myr) VMS, which might also be a runaway, but this would need to be established
from future spectroscopic and astrometric observations, as well as precise distances. If RFS8
were still not meeting the criteria for being a runaway from NGC 3603 from such future data, this would
have important ramifications for current theories of massive star formation, as well as the way
the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is sampled.
