Granular convective motions reach into the lower solar atmosphere, typically causing photospheric
spectral lines to exhibit a differential line shift. This Doppler shift to shorter wavelength is
commonly known as convective blueshift. We performed systematic observations of the quiet Sun
with the Laser Absolute Reference Spectrograph (LARS) at the German Vacuum Tower Telescope. The
solar disk was scanned along the meridian and the equator, from the disk center toward the limb. The
solar spectrum around 6173{\AA} was calibrated with a laser frequency comb on an absolute wavelength
scale with an accuracy of a few m/s. We applied a bisector analysis on the spectral lines to reveal
the changes of convective blueshift and line asymmetry at different heliocentric positions. Being
a signature for convective motions, the bisector curve of Fe i 6173.3{\AA} describes a C-shape at
disk center. When approaching the solar limb, the bisector transforms into a \-shape. The analysis
of the time- and bisector-averaged line shifts yields three distinct results. Firstly, the center-to-limb
variation of Doppler velocities measured with LARS reveals a significant discrepancy (up to 200m/s)
to the full-disk Dopplergrams of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). Secondly, we obtained
a significant decrease of convective blueshift toward the solar limb. Thirdly, the line-of-sight
effect of solar activity leads to a scatter of up to 100m/s at intermediate heliocentric positions.
The accurate observation of the absolute convective blueshift with LARS allows the identification
of systematic discrepancy with Doppler velocities measured by HMI. The center-to-limb variation
of HMI suffers from an additional blueshift toward the limb that is incompatible with our results.
LARS measurements can be taken as reference for the correction of systematic errors in the synoptic
HMI Dopplergrams.
