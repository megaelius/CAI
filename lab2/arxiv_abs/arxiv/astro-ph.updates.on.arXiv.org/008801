Telescope scheduling is the task of determining the best sequence of observations (pointings and
filter choices) for a survey system. The definition of "best" typically comprises a weighted combination
of performance metrics, such as cadence, uniformity of coverage, and image depth. One popular scheduling
algorithm -- the local greedy optimizer -- rank-orders candidate fields and picks the sequence
of $N$ upcoming observations so as to maximize a composite merit function. One point of this paper
is to stress that a local greedy optimizer does not typically produce a global optimum for a multi-year
survey such as LSST. We show here that a deterministic scheduler that forces LSST to observe fields
close to the meridian, alternating between sky regions N and S of the observatory latitude on alternate
nights, equals or outperforms the LSST baseline scheduler in essentially all quantitative performance
metrics. This is due to a number of factors, including our forcing dual visits to a field to occur in
different filters. We find it easier to use a deterministic algorithm than to adjust weights and
penalties to persuade a greedy optimizer to produce a desired outcome. We have developed a prototype
implementation of this deterministic alternative scheduler, which produces observing sequences
that can be compared directly with the LSST baseline plan. Our implementation is considerably faster
than the OpSim, the simulated greedy optimizer currently used by the LSST project: a full ten year
survey can be simulated in 4 minutes, as opposed to tens of hours for OpSim. We also describe a dithering
strategy that achieves uniform spatial coverage at the sub-field level, that is superior to a fixed-field-center
framework.
