Massive, hot OB-stars show clear evidence of strong macroscopic broadening (in addition to rotation)
in their photospheric spectral lines. This paper examines the occurrence of such "macro-turbulence"
in slowly rotating O-stars with strong, organised surface magnetic fields. Focusing on the CIV
5811A line, we find evidence for significant macro-turbulent broadening in all stars except NGC1624-2,
which also has (by far) the strongest magnetic field. Instead, the very sharp CIV lines in NGC1624-2
are dominated by magnetic Zeeman broadening, from which we estimate a dipolar field of approximately
20 kG. By contrast, magnetic broadening is negligible in the other stars (due to their weaker field
strengths, on order 1 kG), and their CIV profiles are typically very broad and similar to corresponding
lines observed in non-magnetic O-stars. Quantifying this by an isotropic, Gaussian macro-turbulence,
we derive vmac = 2.2 (+- 0.9/2.2) km/s for NGC1624-2, and vmac = 20-65 km/s for the rest of the magnetic
sample. We use these observational results to test the hypothesis that the field can stabilise the
atmosphere and suppress the generation of macro-turbulence down to stellar layers where the magnetic
pressure PB and the gas pressure Pg are comparable. Using a simple grey atmosphere to estimate the
temperature T0 at which PB = Pg, we find that T0 > Teff for all investigated magnetic stars, but
that T0 reaches the ~160000 K layers associated with the iron opacity-bump in hot stars only for NGC1624-2.
This is consistent with the view that the responsible physical mechanism for photospheric O-star
macro-turbulence may be stellar gravity-mode oscillations excited by sub-surface convection
zones, and suggests that a sufficiently strong magnetic field can suppress such iron-bump generated
convection and associated pulsational excitation.
