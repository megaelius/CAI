The Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST) is an 18,000 square meter radio telescope
situated some 40 km from the city of Canberra, Australia. Its operating band (820-850 MHz) is now
partly allocated to mobile phone communications, making radio astronomy challenging. We describe
how the deployment of new digital receivers (RX boxes), Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based
filterbanks and server-class computers equipped with 43 GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) has
transformed MOST into a versatile new instrument (the UTMOST) for studying the dynamic radio sky
on millisecond timescales, ideal for work on pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The filterbanks,
servers and their high-speed, low-latency network form part of a hybrid solution to the observatory's
signal processing requirements. The emphasis on software and commodity off-the-shelf hardware
has enabled rapid deployment through the re-use of proven 'software backends' for its signal processing.
The new receivers have ten times the bandwidth of the original MOST and double the sampling of the
line feed, which doubles the field of view. The UTMOST can simultaneously excise interference,
make maps, coherently dedisperse pulsars, and perform real-time searches of coherent fan beams
for dispersed single pulses. Although system performance is still sub-optimal, a pulsar timing
and FRB search programme has commenced and the first UTMOST maps have been made. The telescope operates
as a robotic facility, deciding how to efficiently target pulsars and how long to stay on source,
via feedback from real-time pulsar folding. The regular timing of over 300 pulsars has resulted
in the discovery of 7 pulsar glitches and 3 FRBs. The UTMOST demonstrates that if sufficient signal
processing can be applied to the voltage streams it is possible to perform innovative radio science
in hostile radio frequency environments.
