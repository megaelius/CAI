We present a fully consistent catalog of local and global properties of host galaxies of 882 Type
Ia supernov\ae\ (SNIa) that were selected based on their light-curve properties, spanning the
redshift range $0.01 < z < 1.\text{}$ This catalog corresponds to a preliminary version of the compilation
sample and includes Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) 5-year data, Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS),
and low-redshift surveys. We measured low- and moderate-redshift host galaxy photometry in SNLS
and SDSS images and used spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting techniques to derive host properties
such as stellar mass and $U-V$ rest-frame colors; the latter are an indicator of the luminosity-weighted
age of the stellar population in a galaxy. We also estimated the local observed fluxes at the supernova
location within a proper distance radius of 3 kpc, and transposed them into local $U-V$ rest-frame
colors. Selecting SNIa based on host photometry quality, we then performed cosmological fits using
local color as a third standardization variable, for which we split the sample at the median value.
We find a local color step as significant as the maximum mass step effect. Correcting for the maximum
mass step correction, we still find a significant local color effect, which shows that additional
information is provided by the close environment of SNIa. Departures from the initial choices were
investigated, and we discuss the possible implications for cosmology. This will be of tremendous
importance for the forthcoming SNIa surveys, and in particular for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
(LSST), for which uncertainties on the dark energy equation of state will be comparable to the effects
reported here.
