Magnetohydrodynamic interactions between plasma flows and magnetic fields is fundamental to
the origin and sustenance of the 11-year sunspot cycle. These processes are intrinsically three-dimensional
(3D) in nature. Our goal is to construct a 3D solar dynamo model that on the one hand captures the buoyant
emergence of tilted bipolar sunspot pairs, and on the other hand produces cyclic large-scale field
reversals mediated via surface flux-transport processes -- that is, the Babcock-Leighton mechanism.
We perform kinematic dynamo simulations where the prescribed velocity field is a combination of
solar-like differential rotation and meridional circulation, along with a parametrized turbulent
diffusivity. We use a novel methodology for modeling magnetic buoyancy through field-strength-dependent
3D helical up-flows that results in the formation of tilted bipolar sunspots. The bipolar spots
produced in our simulations participate in the process of poloidal-field generation through the
Babcock-Leighton mechanism, resulting in self-sustained and periodic large-scale magnetic
field reversal. Our parameter space study varying the amplitude of the meridional flow, the convection
zone diffusivity, and parameters governing the efficiency of the magnetic buoyancy mechanism
reveal their relative roles in determining properties of the sunspot cycle such as amplitude, period,
and dynamical memory relevant to solar cycle prediction. We also derive a new dynamo number for the
Babcock-Leighton solar dynamo mechanism which reasonably captures our model dynamics. This study
elucidates the relative roles of different flux-transport processes in the Sun's convection zone
in determining the properties and physics of the sunspot cycle and could potentially lead to realistic,
data-driven 3D dynamo models for solar-activity predictions and exploration of stellar magnetism
and starspot formation in other stars.
