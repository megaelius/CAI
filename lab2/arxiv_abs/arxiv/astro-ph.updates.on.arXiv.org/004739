We carry out a general relativistic study of radiatively driven, conical fluid jets around non-rotating
black holes and investigate the effects and significance of radiative acceleration, as well as
radiation drag. We apply relativistic equations of motion in curved space-time around a Schwarzschild
black hole for axis-symmetric 1-D jet in steady state, plying through the radiation field of the
accretion disc. Radiative moments are computed using information of curved space-time. Slopes
of physical variables at the sonic points are found using L$^{\prime}$H\^opital's rule and employed
Runge-Kutta's $4^{th}$ order method to solve equations of motion. The analysis is carried out,
using the relativistic equation of state of the jet fluid. The terminal speed of the jet depends on
how much thermal energy is converted into jet momentum and how much radiation momentum is deposited
on to the jet. Many classes of jet solutions with single sonic points, multiple sonic points as well
as, those having radiation driven internal shocks are obtained. Variation of all flow variables
along the jet-axis has been studied. Highly energetic electron-proton jets can be accelerated
by intense radiation to terminal Lorentz factors $\gamma_{\rm \small T} \sim 3$. Moderate terminal
speed $v_{\rm \small T} \sim 0.5$ is obtained for moderately luminous discs. Lepton dominated jets
may achieve $\gamma_{\rm \small T} \sim 10$. Thermal driving of the jet itself and radiation driving
by accretion disc photons produce a wide-ranging jet solutions staring from moderately strong
jets to the relativistic ones. Interplay of intensity and nature of radiation field and the energetics
of the jet result in such a variety in jet solutions. We show that radiation field is able to induce
steady shocks in jets, one of the criteria to explain high energy power law emission observed in spectra
of some of the astrophysical objects.
