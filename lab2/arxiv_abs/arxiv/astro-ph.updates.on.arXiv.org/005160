Uncertainties in atomic models will introduce noticeable additional systematics in calculating
the flux of weak dielectronic recombination (DR) satellite lines, affecting the detection and
flux measurements of other weak spectral lines. One important example is the Ar XVII He-beta DR,
which is expected to be present in emission from the hot intracluster medium of galaxy clusters and
impacts measurements of the flux of the 3.5 keV line that has been suggested as a secondary emission
from a dark matter interaction. To test the atomic models, we used the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory's EBIT-I electron beam ion trap and the X-Ray Spectrometer quantum calorimeter XRS/EBIT,
whose energy resolution is 5 eV, to measure the X-ray emission following resonant DR onto helium-like
and lithium-like Argon. The measurements were completed using EBIT-I's Maxwellian simulator
mode at a simulated electron temperature of Te=1.7 keV, similar to the plasma temperature observed
in clusters of galaxies. We find that the measured summed flux of the Ar XVII He-beta DR line relative
to the Ar XVI He-beta is underestimated by a factor of 2.3 in the atomic models of AtomDB v3.0.8 and
previous versions. Although a substantial difference, it does not affect the results of Bulbul
et al. (2014a) as they included a factor of three variance when determining the flux of the 3.5 keV
line to account for potential uncertainties related to atomic models. As part of this study, a number
of weak lines in the 3.5-3.6 keV band were identified from transitions not included in the original
model. Once included however, the flux from these lines still does not account for the flux in the
3.5 keV line assuming reasonable plasma parameters. Therefore, the possible Ar XVII He-beta DR
origin of the line mentioned in Bulbul et al. (2014a) can be excluded. (Abridged).
