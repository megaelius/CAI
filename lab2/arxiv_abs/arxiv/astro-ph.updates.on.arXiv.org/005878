Globular clusters (GCs) and their dynamic interactions with the Galactic components provide an
important insight into the structure and formation of the early Milky Way. Here, we present a kinematic
study of two outer halo GCs based on a combination of VLT/FORS2, VLT/FLAMES, and Magellan/MIKE low-
and high-resolution spectroscopy of 32 and 27 member stars, respectively. Although both clusters
are located at Galactocentric distances of 15 kpc, they have otherwise very different properties.
M 75 is a luminous and metal-rich system at [Fe/H] = $-1.2$ dex, a value that we confirm from the calcium
triplet region. This GC shows mild evidence for rotation with an amplitude of A$_{\rm rot}\sim$5
km s$^{-1}$. One of the most metal-poor GCs in the Milky Way (at [FeII/H] = $-2.3$ dex), NGC 6426 exhibits
marginal evidence of internal rotation at the 2 km s$^{-1}$ level. Both objects have velocity dispersions
that are consistent with their luminosity. Although limited by small-number statistics, the resulting
limits on their $A_{\rm rot}/\sigma_0$ ratios suggest that M 75 is a slow rotator driven by internal
dynamics rather than being effected by the weak Galactic tides at its large distances. Here, M 75
($A_{\rm rot}/\sigma=0.31$) is fully consistent with the properties of other, younger halo clusters.
At $A_{\rm rot}/\sigma_0=0.8\pm0.4$, NGC 6426 appears to have a remarkably ordered internal motion
for its low metallicity, but the large uncertainty does not allow for an unambiguous categorization
as a fast rotator. An accretion origin of M 75 cannot be excluded, based on the eccentric orbit, which
we derived from the recent data release 2 of Gaia, and considering its younger age.
