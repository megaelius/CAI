We investigate the structure of self-gravitating disks, their fragmentation and the evolution
of the resulting fragments (the clumps). We show that the assumption of a globally constant viscous
parameter $\alpha$ can only describe a globally isothermal disk. On the other hand, under the assumption
that local viscous heating balances local radiation cooling, a quasi-steady self gravitating
disk has very steep radial profiles. Then, we explore the structure of the self-gravitating disk
using three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations. The simulations show that non-local
radiation transfer determines the disk temperature and local balance between radiation cooling
and viscous heating does not hold. Because the radiation process is not local and radiation from
the interstellar medium cannot be ignored, efficient radiation cooling would not be realized in
a massive disk around a low mass star. Thus, we conclude the fragmentation criterion based on the
assumption of local radiation cooling cannot be applied to disk fragmentation process around low
mass star; instead, mass accretion from the envelope is the most probable mechanism for disk fragmentation.
We determine the parameter range in which disk fragmentation occurs. This is consistent with that
obtained from simulations with the barotropic equation of state. This indicates that detailed
treatment of radiation is not important for disk fragmentation driven by mass accretion. We also
investigate the internal evolution of clumps. We show that the evolution of the central temperature
of a clump does not cross the $\tau_J=1$ line around which clumps become optically thick and the line
determines the minimum value of central entropy. Using this value, we find the minimum initial mass
of clumps to be $3 M_{\rm Jupiter}$. This value is consistent with the mass of clumps that formed in
our simulations.
