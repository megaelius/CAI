The most intensively star-forming galaxies are extremely luminous at far-infrared (FIR) wavelengths,
highly obscured at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths, and lie at $z\ge 1-3$. We present a programme
of ${\it Herschel}$ FIR spectroscopic observations with the SPIRE FTS and photometric observations
with PACS, both on board ${\it Herschel}$, towards a sample of 45 gravitationally lensed, dusty
starbursts across $z\sim 1-3.6$. In total, we detected 27 individual lines down to 3-$\sigma$,
including nine $[\rm C{\small II}]$ 158-$\mu$m lines with confirmed spectroscopic redshifts,
five possible $[\rm C{\small II}]$ lines consistent with their far-infrared photometric redshifts,
and in some individual sources a few $[\rm O{\small III}]$ 88-$\mu$m, $[\rm O{\small III}]$ 52-$\mu$m,
$[\rm O{\small I}]$ 145-$\mu$m, $[\rm O{\small I}]$ 63-$\mu$m, $[\rm N{\small II}]$ 122-$\mu$m,
and OH 119-$\mu$m (in absorption) lines. To derive the typical physical properties of the gas in
the sample, we stack all spectra weighted by their intrinsic luminosity and by their 500-$\mu$m
flux densities, with the spectra scaled to a common redshift. In the stacked spectra, we detect emission
lines of $[\rm C{\small II}]$ 158-$\mu$m, $[\rm N{\small II}]$ 122-$\mu$m, $[\rm O{\small III}]$
88-$\mu$m, $[\rm O{\small III}]$ 52-$\mu$m, $[\rm O{\small I}]$ 63-$\mu$m, and the absorption
doublet of OH at 119-$\mu$m, at high fidelity. We find that the average electron densities traced
by the $[\rm N{\small II}]$ and $[\rm O{\small III}]$ lines are higher than the average values in
local star-forming galaxies and ULIRGs, using the same tracers. From the $[\rm N{\small II}]/[\rm
C{\small II}]$ and $[\rm O{\small I}]/[\rm C{\small II}]$ ratios, we find that the $[\rm C{\small
II}]$ emission is likely dominated by the photo-dominated regions (PDR), instead of by ionised
gas or large-scale shocks.
