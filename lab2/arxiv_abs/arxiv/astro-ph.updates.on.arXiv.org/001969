We present a comprehensive analysis of a broad band spectral line survey of the Orion Kleinmann-Low
nebula (Orion KL), one of the most chemically rich regions in the Galaxy, using the HIFI instrument
on board the Herschel Space Observatory. This survey spans a frequency range from 480 to 1907 GHz
at a resolution of 1.1 MHz. These observations thus encompass the largest spectral coverage ever
obtained toward this high-mass star-forming region in the sub-mm with high spectral resolution,
and include frequencies $>$ 1 THz where the Earth's atmosphere prevents observations from the
ground. In all, we detect emission from 39 molecules (79 isotopologues). Combining this dataset
with ground based mm spectroscopy obtained with the IRAM 30 m telescope, we model the molecular emission
from the mm to the far-IR using the XCLASS program which assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium
(LTE). Several molecules are also modeled with the MADEX non-LTE code. Because of the wide frequency
coverage, our models are constrained by transitions over an unprecedented range in excitation
energy. A reduced $\chi^{2}$ analysis indicates that models for most species reproduce the observed
emission well. In particular, most complex organics are well fit by LTE implying gas densities are
high ($>$10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$) and excitation temperatures and column densities are well constrained.
Molecular abundances are computed using H$_{2}$ column densities also derived from the HIFI survey.
The distribution of rotation temperatures, $T_{\rm rot}$, for molecules detected toward the hot
core is significantly wider than the compact ridge, plateau, and extended ridge $T_{\rm rot}$ distributions,
indicating the hot core has the most complex thermal structure.
