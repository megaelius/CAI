We present a procedure to generally constrain the environments of neutrino-producing sites in
photomeson production models of jetted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) where any origin of the dominant
target photon field can be accommodated. For this purpose we reconstruct the minimum target photon
spectrum required to produce the (observed) neutrino spectrum, and derive all corresponding secondary
particles. These initiate electromagnetic cascades with an efficiency that is linked to the neutrino
production rate. The derived photon spectra represent the minimum radiation emerging from the
source that is strictly associated to the photo-hadronically produced neutrinos. Using the 2014-15
neutrino spectrum observed by IceCube from TXS 0506+056, we conduct a comprehensive study of these
cascade spectra and compare them to the simultaneous multi-wavelength emission. For this set of
observations, photopion production from a co-spatially produced (co-moving) photon target can
be ruled out as well as a setup where synchrotron or Compton-synchrotron supported cascades on a
stationary (AGN rest frame) target photon field operate in this source. However, a scenario where
Compton-driven cascades develop in the stationary soft-X-ray photon target which photo-hadronically
produced the observed neutrinos appears feasible with required proton kinetic jet powers near
the Eddington limit. The source is then found to produce neutrinos inefficiently, and emits GeV
photons significantly below the observed Fermi-LAT-flux. Hence, the neutrinos and the bulk of
the gamma rays observed in 2014/2015 from TXS 0506+056 cannot have been initiated by the same process.
