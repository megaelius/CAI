Context: The Crab pulsar and its nebula are the origin of relativistic electrons which can be observed
through their synchrotron and inverse Compton emission. The transition between synchrotron-dominated
and inverse-Compton-dominated emissions takes place at $\approx 10^9$ eV. Aims: The short-term
(weeks to months) flux variability of the synchrotron emission from the most energetic electrons
is investigated with data from ten years of observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT)
in the energy range from 60 MeV to 600 MeV. Methods: The off-pulse light-curve has been reconstructed
from phase-resolved data. The corresponding histogram of flux measurements is used to identify
distributions of flux-states and the statistical significance of a lower-flux component is estimated
with dedicated simulations of mock light-curves. The energy spectra for different flux states
are reconstructed. Results: We confirm the presence of flaring-states which follow a log-normal
flux distribution. Additionally, we discover a low-flux state where the flux drops to less than
16.8 \% of the time-averaged flux and stays there for several weeks. The transition time is observed
to be as short as 2 days. The energy spectrum during the low-flux state resembles the extrapolation
of the inverse-Compton spectrum measured at energies beyond several GeV energy, implying near
quiescence in the high-energy part of the synchrotron emission. Conclusions: The low-flux state
found here and the transition time of at most 10 days indicate that the bulk ($>75$\%) of the synchrotron
emission above $10^8$ eV originates in a compact volume with apparent angular size of $\theta\approx0.4"
t_\mathrm{var}/(5 \mathrm{d})$. We tentatively identify the so-called inner knot feature as
the origin of the bulk of the gamma-ray emission as predicted by Komissarov & Lyutikov (2011).
