This work revisits the electrostatic instability for blazar-induced pair beams propagating through
IGM with the methods of linear analysis and PIC simulations. We study the impact of the realistic
distribution function of pairs resulting from interaction of high-energy gamma-rays with the
extragalactic background light. We present analytical and numerical calculations of the linear
growth rate of the instability for arbitrary orientation of wave vectors. Our results explicitly
demonstrate that the finite angular spread of the beam dramatically affects the growth rate of the
waves, leading to fastest growth for wave vectors quasi-parallel to the beam direction and a growth
rate at oblique directions that is only by a factor of 2-4 smaller compared to the maximum. To study
the non-linear beam relaxation, we performed PIC simulations that take into account a realistic
wide-energy distribution of beam particles. The parameters of the simulated beam-plasma system
provide an adequate physical picture that can be extrapolated to realistic blazar-induced pairs.
In our simulations the beam looses only 1\% percent of its energy, and we analytically estimate that
the beam would lose its total energy over about $100$ simulation times. Analytical scaling is then
used to extrapolate to the parameters of realistic blazar-induced pair beams. We find that they
can dissipate their energy slightly faster by the electrostatic instability than through inverse-Compton
scattering. The uncertainties arising from, e.g., details of the primary gamma-ray spectrum are
too large to make firm statements for individual blazars, and an analysis based on their specific
properties is required.
