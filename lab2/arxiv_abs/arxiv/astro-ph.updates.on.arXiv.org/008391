Young planets are expected to cause perturbations in protostellar disks that may be used to infer
their presence. Clear detection of still-forming planets embedded within gas-rich disks is rare.
HD 169142 is a very young Herbig Ae-Be star surrounded by a pre-transitional disk, composed of at
least three rings. While claims of sub-stellar objects around this star have been made previously,
follow-up studies remain inconclusive. We used SPHERE at ESO VLT to obtain a sequence of high-contrast
images of the immediate surroundings of this star over about three years. This enables a photometric
and astrometric analysis of the structures in the disk. While we were unable to definitively confirm
the previous claims of a massive sub-stellar object at 0.1-0.15 arcsec from the star, we found both
spirals and blobs within the disk. The spiral pattern may be explained as due to the presence of a primary,
a secondary, and a tertiary arm excited by a planet of a few Jupiter masses lying along the primary
arm, likely in the cavities between the rings. The blobs orbit the star consistently with Keplerian
motion, allowing a dynamical determination of the mass of the star. While most of these blobs are
located within the rings, we found that one of them lies in the cavity between the rings, along the
primary arm of the spiral design. This blob might be due to a planet that might also be responsible
for the spiral pattern observed within the rings and for the cavity between the two rings. The planet
itself is not detected at short wavelengths, where we only see a dust cloud illuminated by stellar
light, but the planetary photosphere might be responsible for the emission observed in the K band.
The mass of this putative planet may be constrained using photometric and dynamical arguments;
it should be between 1 and 4 Jupiter masses. The brightest blobs are found at the 1:2 resonance with
this putative planet
