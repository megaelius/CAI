The distinguishing feature of the evolution of close binary stars is the role played by the mass exchange
between the component stars. Whether the mass transfer is dynamically stable is one of the essential
questions in binary evolution. In the limit of extremely rapid mass transfer, the response of a donor
star in an interacting binary becomes asymptotically one of adiabatic expansion. We use the adiabatic
mass loss model to systematically survey the thresholds for dynamical timescale mass transfer
over the entire span of possible donor star evolutionary states. We also simulate mass loss process
with isentropic envelopes, the specific entropy of which is fixed to be that at the base of the convective
envelope, to artificially mimic the effect of such mass loss in superadiabatic surface convection
regions, where the adiabatic approximation fails. We illustrate the general adiabatic response
of 3.2 Msun donor stars at different evolutionary stages. We extend our study to a grid of donor stars
with different masses (from 0.1 to 100 Msun with Z = 0.02) and at different evolutionary stages. We
proceed to present our criteria for dynamically unstable mass transfer in both tabular and graphical
forms. For red giant branch and asymptotic giant branch donors in systems with such mass ratios,
they may have convective envelopes deep enough to evolve into common envelopes on a thermal timescale,
if the donor star overfills its outer Lagrangian radius. Our results show that the red giant branch
and asymptotic giant branch stars tend to be more stable than previously believed, and this may be
helpful to explain the abundance of observed post-AGB binary stars with an orbital period of around
1000 days.
