Comet C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS) has a peculiar volatile composition, with CO being the dominant volatile
as opposed to H$_2$O and one of the largest N$_2$/CO ratios ever observed in a comet. Using observations
obtained with the \textit{Spitzer Space Telescope}, NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility, the
3.5-meter ARC telescope at Apache Point Observatory, the Discovery Channel Telescope at Lowell
Observatory, and the Arizona Radio Observatory 10-m Submillimeter Telescope we quantified the
abundances of 12 different species in the coma of R2 PanSTARRS. We confirm the high abundances of
CO and N$_2$ and heavy depletions of H$_2$O, HCN, CH$_3$OH, and H$_2$CO compared to CO reported by
previous studies. We provide the first measurements (or most sensitive measurements/constraints)
on H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, OCS, C$_2$H$_2$, and NH$_3$, all of which are depleted relative
to CO by at least one to two orders of magnitude compared to values commonly observed in comets. The
observed species also show strong enhancements relative to H$_2$O, and even when compared to other
species like CH$_4$ or CH$_3$OH most species show deviations from typical comets by at least a factor
of two to three. The only mixing ratios found to be close to typical are CH$_3$OH/CO$_2$ and CH$_3$OH/CH$_4$.
While R2 PanSTARRS was located at a heliocentric distance of 2.8 AU at the time of our observations
in January/February 2018, we argue that this alone cannot account for the peculiar observed composition
of this comet and therefore must reflect its intrinsic composition. We discuss possible implications
for this clear outlier in compositional studies of comets obtained to date, and encourage future
dynamical and chemical modeling in order to better understand what the composition of R2 PanSTARRS
tells us about the early Solar System.
