Among the key parameters defining the ISM of galaxies is the fraction of the metals that are locked
up in dust: the metals-to-dust ratio. This ratio bears not only on the ISM and its evolution, but particularly
on the origin of cosmic dust. We combine extinction and abundance data from GRB afterglows, from
QSO absorbers, as well as from galaxy-lensed QSOs, to determine the metals-to-dust ratios for lines-of-sight
through a wide diversity of galaxies from blue, dwarf starbursts to massive ellipticals, across
a vast range in redshift z=0.1-6.3, and nearly three orders of magnitude in column density and metal
abundance. We thus determine the metals-to-dust ratio in a unique way, providing direct determinations
of in situ gas and dust columns without recourse to assumptions with large uncertainties. We find
that the metals-to-dust ratios in these systems are surprisingly close to the value for the local
group (10^{21.3} cm-2 A_V mag-1), with a mean value of 10^{21.2} cm-2 A_V mag-1 and a standard deviation
of 0.3 dex. There is no evidence of deviation from this mean ratio as a function of metallicity, even
down to our lowest metallicity of 0.01 Z/Z_sun. The lack of any obvious dependence of the metals-to-dust
ratio on either column density, galaxy type or age, redshift, or metallicity indicates a close correspondence
between the formation of the metals and the formation of dust. Any delay between the formation of
metals and dust must be shorter than the typical metal-enrichment times of these galaxies. Formation
of the bulk of the dust in low mass stars is therefore ruled out by these data at any cosmic epoch. Furthermore,
dust destruction must not dominate over formation/growth in virtually any galaxy environment.
The correlation between metals and dust is a natural consequence of the formation of the bulk of dust
in SNe [Abridged].
