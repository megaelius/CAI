A clustering algorithm is applied to Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem continuum and methane band
images of Saturns northern hemisphere to objectively classify regional albedo features and aid
in their dynamical interpretation. The procedure is based on a technique applied previously to
visible-infrared images of Earth. It provides a new perspective on giant planet cloud morphology
and its relationship to the dynamics and a meteorological context for the analysis of other types
of simultaneous Saturn observations. The method identifies six clusters that exhibit distinct
morphology, vertical structure, and preferred latitudes of occurrence. These correspond to areas
dominated by deep convective cells; low contrast areas, some including thinner and thicker clouds
possibly associated with baroclinic instability; regions with possible isolated thin cirrus
clouds; darker areas due to thinner low level clouds or clearer skies due to downwelling, or due to
absorbing particles; and fields of relatively shallow cumulus clouds. The spatial associations
among these cloud types suggest that dynamically, there are three distinct types of latitude bands
on Saturn: deep convectively disturbed latitudes in cyclonic shear regions poleward of the eastward
jets; convectively suppressed regions near and surrounding the westward jets; and baroclinically
unstable latitudes near eastward jet cores and in the anti-cyclonic regions equatorward of them.
These are roughly analogous to some of the features of Earths tropics, subtropics, and midlatitudes,
respectively. Temporal variations of feature contrast and cluster occurrence suggest that the
upper tropospheric haze in the northern hemisphere may have thickened by 2014.
