The organic compounds HCN and C2H2, present in protoplanetary disks, may react to form precursor
molecules of the nucleobases, such as the pyrimidine molecule, C4H4N2. Depending on the temperature
in a given region of the disk, molecules are in the gas phase or condensed onto grain surfaces. The
action of X-ray photons and MeV protons, emitted by the young central star, may lead to several physical
and chemical processes in such prestellar environments. In this work we have experimentally investigated
the ionization, dissociation and desorption processes of pyrimidine in the condensed and the gas
phase stimulated by soft X-rays and protons, respectively. Pyrimidine was frozen at temperatures
below 130 K and irradiated with X-rays at energies from 394 to 427 eV. In the gas phase experiment,
a pyrimidine effusive jet at room temperature was bombarded with protons of 2.5 MeV. In both experiments,
the time-of-flight mass-spectrometry technique was employed. Partial photodesorption ion yields
as a function of the X-ray photon energy for ions such as C3H2+, HC3NH+ and C4H+ were determined. The
experimental results were applied to conditions of the protoplanetary disk of TW Hydra star. Assuming
three density profiles of molecular hydrogen, 1 x 10^6, 1 x 10^7 and 1 x 10^8 cm^-3, we determined HC3NH+
ion-production rates of the order of 10^-31 up to 10^-8 ions cm^-3 s^-1. Integrating over 1 x 10^6
yr, HC3NH^+ column density values, ranging from 3.47 x 10^9 to 1.29 x 10^13 cm^-2, were obtained as
a function of the distance from central star. The optical depth is the main variable that affects
ions production. In addition, computational simulations were used to determine the kinetic energies
of ions desorbed from pyrimidine ice distributed between ~ 7 and 15 eV.
