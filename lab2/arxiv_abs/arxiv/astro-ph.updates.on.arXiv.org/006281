Arguably the main challenge of galactic magnetism studies is to explain how the interstellar medium
of galaxies reaches energetic equipartition despite the extremely weak cosmic primordial magnetic
fields that are originally predicted to thread the inter-galactic medium. Previous numerical
studies of isolated galaxies suggest that a fast dynamo amplification might suffice to bridge the
gap spanning many orders of magnitude in strength between the weak early Universe magnetic fields
and the ones observed in high redshift galaxies. To better understand their evolution in the cosmological
context of hierarchical galaxy growth, we probe the amplification process undergone by the cosmic
magnetic field within a spiral galaxy to unprecedented accuracy by means of a suite of constrained
transport magnetohydrodynamical adaptive mesh refinement cosmological zoom simulations with
different stellar feedback prescriptions. A galactic turbulent dynamo is found to be naturally
excited in this cosmological environment, being responsible for most of the amplification of the
magnetic energy. Indeed, we find that the magnetic energy spectra of simulated galaxies display
telltale inverse cascades. Overall, the amplification process can be divided in three main phases,
which are related to different physical mechanisms driving galaxy evolution: an initial collapse
phase, an accretion-driven phase, and a feedback-driven phase. While different feedback models
affect the magnetic field amplification differently, all tested models prove to be subdominant
at early epochs, before the feedback-driven phase is reached. Thus the three-phase evolution paradigm
is found to be quite robust vis-a-vis feedback prescriptions.
