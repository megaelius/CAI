We study the visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectral properties of different ACO populations
and compare them to the independently determined properties of comets. We select our ACOs sample
based on published dynamical criteria and present our own observational results obtained using
the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope (WHT), the 3.56m
Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG), and the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT), all located at the
El Roque de los Muchachos Observatory (La Palma, Spain), and the 3.0m NASA Infrared Telescope Facility
(IRTF), located at the Mauna Kea Observatory, in Hawaii. We include in the analysis the spectra of
ACOs obtained from the literature. We derive the spectral class and the visible and NIR spectral
slopes. We also study the presence of hydrated minerals by studying the 0.7 $\mu$m band and the UV-drop
below 0.5 $\mu$m associated with phyllosilicates. We present new observations of 17 ACOs, 11 of
them observed in the visible, 2 in the NIR and 4 in the visible and NIR. We also discuss the spectra of
12 ACOs obtained from the literature. All but two ACOs have a primitive-like class spectrum (X or
D-type). Almost 100\% of the ACOs in long-period cometary orbits (Damocloids) are D-types. Those
in Jupiter family comet orbits (JFC-ACOs) are $\sim$ 60\% D-types and $\sim$ 40\% X-types. The mean
spectral slope $S'$ of JFC-ACOs is 9.7 $\pm$ 4.6 \%/1000 \AA \ and for the Damocloids this is 12.2 $\pm$
2.0 \%/1000 \AA . No evidence of hydration on the surface of ACOs is found from their visible spectra.
The slope and spectral class distribution of ACOs is similar to that of comets. The spectral classification,
the spectral slope distribution of ACOs, and the lack of spectral features indicative of the presence
of hydrated minerals on their surface, strongly suggest that ACOs are likely dormant or extinct
comets.
