The variability of the spectral solar irradiance (SSI) over the course of the 11-year solar cycle
is one of the manifestations of solar magnetic activity. There is a strong evidence that the SSI variability
has an effect on the Earth's atmosphere. The faster rotation of the Sun in the past lead to a more vigorous
action of solar dynamo and thus potentially to larger amplitude of the SSI variability on the timescale
of the solar activity cycle. This could led to a stronger response of the Earth's atmosphere as well
as other solar system planets' atmospheres to the solar activity cycle. We calculate the amplitude
of the SSI and TSI variability over the course of the solar activity cycle as a function of solar age.
We employ the relationship between the stellar magnetic activity and the age based on observations
of solar twins. Using this relation we reconstruct solar magnetic activity and the corresponding
solar disk area coverages by magnetic features (i.e. spots and faculae) over the last four billion
years. These disk coverages are then used to calculate the amplitude of the solar-cycle SSI variability
as a function of wavelength and solar age. Our calculations show that the young Sun was significantly
more variable than the present Sun. The amplitude of the solar-cycle Total Solar Irradiance (TSI)
variability of the 600 Myr old Sun was about 10 times larger than that of the present Sun. Furthermore,
the variability of the young Sun was spot-dominated (the Sun being brighter at the activity minimum
than in the maximum), i.e. the Sun was overall brighter at activity minima than at maxima. The amplitude
of the TSI variability decreased with solar age until it reached a minimum value at 2.8 Gyr. After
this point, the TSI variability is faculae-dominated (the Sun is brighter at the activity maximum)
and its amplitude increases with age.
