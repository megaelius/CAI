We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and ground-based optical and near-infrared observations
of SN 2005hk and SN 2008A, typical members of the Type Iax class of supernovae (SNe). These objects
are peculiar cousins of normal Type Ia SNe, with SN 2002cx as the prototype. Here we focus on late-time
observations, where these objects deviate most dramatically from normal SNe Ia. Instead of the
dominant nebular emission lines that are observed in normal SNe Ia at late phases (and indeed, in
SNe of all other types), spectra of SNe 2005hk and 2008A show lines of Fe II, Ca II, and Fe I more than
a year past maximum light, along with narrow [Fe II] and [Ca II] emission. We use spectral features
to constrain the temperature and density of the ejecta, and find high densities at late times, with
n_e >~ 10^9 cm^-3. Such high densities should yield enhanced cooling of the ejecta, making these
objects good candidates to observe the expected "infrared catastrophe," a generic feature of SN
Ia models. However, our HST photometry of SN 2008A does not match the predictions of an infrared catastrophe.
Moreover, our HST observations rule out a "pure deflagration" model for these peculiar SNe, showing
no evidence for unburned material at late times. We derive an upper limit of 0.14 solar masses of low-density
oxygen in SN 2008A nearly 600 days after maximum light, at odds with the pure deflagration prediction.
We argue that the observed late-time line velocities (shifts and widths), of order ~500 km/s, imply
the explosion did not fully disrupt the white dwarf. Failed deflagration explosion models, leaving
behind a bound remnant, can match some of the observed properties of SNe Iax, but no published model
is consistent with all of our observations of SNe 2005hk and 2008A.
