The recent analysis of low-redshift supernovae (SN) has increased the apparent tension between
the value of $H_0$ estimated from low and high redshift observations such as the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) radiation. At the same time other observations have provided evidence of the existence
of local radial inhomogeneities extending in different directions up to a redshift of about $0.07$.
About $40\%$ of the Cepheids used for SN calibration are directly affected because are located along
the directions of these inhomogeneities. We derive a new simple formula relating directly the luminosity
distance to the monopole of the density contrast, which does not involve any metric perturbation.
We then use it to develop a new inversion method to reconstruct the monopole of the density field from
the deviations of the redshift uncorrected observed luminosity distance respect to the $\Lambda
CDM$ prediction based on cosmological parameters obtained from large scale observations. The
inversion method confirms the existence of inhomogeneities whose effects were not previously
taken into account because the $2M++$ density field maps used to obtain the peculiar velocity for
redshift correction were for $z\leq 0.06$, which is not a sufficiently large scale to detect the
presence of inhomogeneities extending up to $z=0.07$. The inhomogeneity does not affect the high
redshift luminosity distance because the volume averaged density contrast tends to zero asymptotically,
making the value of $H_0^{CMB}$ obtained from CMB observations insensitive to any local structure.
The inversion method can provide a unique tool to reconstruct the density field at high redshift
where only SN data is available, and in particular to normalize correctly the density field respect
to the average large scale density of the Universe.
