Recently, Squire & Hopkins (2017) showed any coupled dust-gas mixture is subject to a class of linear
'resonant drag instabilities' (RDI). These can drive large dust-to-gas ratio fluctuations even
at arbitrarily small dust-to-gas mass ratios. Here, we identify and study both resonant and new
non-resonant instabilities, in the simple case where the gas satisfies neutral hydrodynamics
and supports acoustic waves ($\omega^{2}=c_{s}^{2}\,k^{2}$). The gas and dust are coupled via
an arbitrary drag law and subject to external accelerations (e.g. gravity, radiation pressure).
If there is any dust drift velocity, the system is unstable. The instabilities exist for {\em all}
dust-to-gas ratios $\mu$ and their growth rates depend only weakly on $\mu$ around resonance, as
$\sim\mu^{1/3}$ or $\sim \mu^{1/2}$ (depending on wavenumber). The behavior changes depending
on whether the drift velocity is larger or smaller than the sound speed $c_{s}$. In the supersonic
regime a 'resonant' instability appears with growth rate increasing without limit with wavenumber,
even for vanishingly small $\mu$ and values of the coupling strength ('stopping time'). In the subsonic
regime non-resonant instabilities always exist, but their growth rates no longer increase indefinitely
towards small wavelengths. The dimensional scalings and qualitative behavior of the instability
do not depend sensitively on the drag law or equation-of-state of the gas. The instabilities directly
drive exponentially growing dust-to-gas-ratio fluctuations, which can be large even when the
modes are otherwise weak. We discuss physical implications for cool-star winds, AGN-driven winds
and torii, and starburst winds: the instabilities alter the character of these outflows and could
drive clumping and/or turbulence in the dust and gas.
