Transmission spectroscopy is a promising tool for the atmospheric characterization of transiting
exoplanets. Because the planetary signal is faint, discrepancies have been reported regarding
individual targets. We investigate the dependence of the estimated transmission spectrum on deviations
of the orbital parameters of the star-planet system that are due to the limb-darkening effects of
the host star. We describe how the uncertainty on the orbital parameters translates into an uncertainty
on the planetary spectral slope. We created synthetic transit light curves in seven different wavelength
bands, from the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, and fit them with transit models parameterized
by fixed deviating values of the impact parameter $b$. Our simulations show a wavelength-dependent
offset that is more pronounced at the blue wavelengths where the limb-darkening effect is stronger.
This offset introduces a slope in the planetary transmission spectrum that becomes steeper with
increasing $b$ values. Variations of $b$ by positive or negative values within its uncertainty
interval introduce positive or negative slopes, thus the formation of an error envelope. The amplitude
from blue optical to near-infrared wavelength for a typical uncertainty on $b$ corresponds to one
atmospheric pressure scale height and more. This impact parameter degeneracy is confirmed for
different host types; K stars present prominently steeper slopes, while M stars indicate features
at the blue wavelengths. We demonstrate that transmission spectra can be hard to interpret, basically
because of the limitations in defining a precise impact parameter value for a transiting exoplanet.
This consequently limits a characterization of its atmosphere.
