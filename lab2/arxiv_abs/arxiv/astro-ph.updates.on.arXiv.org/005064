This paper presents a study of circumstellar debris around Sun-like stars using data from the Herschel
DEBRIS Key Programme. DEBRIS is an unbiased survey comprising the nearest ~90 stars of each spectral
type A-M. Analysis of the 275 F-K stars shows that excess emission from a debris disc was detected
around 47 stars, giving a detection rate of 17.1+2.6-2.3 per cent, with lower rates for later spectral
types. For each target a blackbody spectrum was fitted to the dust emission to determine its fractional
luminosity and temperature. The derived under- lying distribution of fractional luminosity versus
blackbody radius in the population showed that most detected discs are concentrated at f ~ 10^-5
and at temperatures corresponding to blackbody radii 7-40 AU, which scales to ~40 AU for realistic
dust properties (similar to the current Kuiper belt). Two outlying populations are also evident;
five stars have exceptionally bright emission ( f > 5x10^-5), and one has unusually hot dust < 4 AU.
The excess emission distributions at all wavelengths were fitted with a steady-state evolution
model, showing these are compatible with all stars being born with a narrow belt that then undergoes
collisional grinding. However, the model cannot explain the hot dust systems - likely originating
in transient events - and bright emission systems - arising potentially from atypically massive
discs or recent stirring. The emission from the present-day Kuiper belt is predicted to be close
to the median of the population, suggesting that half of stars have either depleted their Kuiper
belts (similar to the Solar System), or had a lower planetesimal formation efficiency.
