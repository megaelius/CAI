High-resolution spectroscopy has revealed large concentrations of CNO and sometimes other intermediate-mass
elements in the shells ejected during nova outbursts, suggesting that the solar composition material
transferred from the secondary mixes with the outermost layers of the underlying white dwarf during
the thermonuclear runaway. Multidimensional simulations have shown that Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities
provide self-enrichment of the accreted envelope with material from the outermost layers of the
white dwarf, at levels that agree with observations. However, the Eulerian and time-explicit nature
of most multidimensional codes used to date and the overwhelming computational load have limited
their applicability, and no multidimensional simulation has been conducted for a full nova cycle.
This paper explores a new methodology that combines 1-D and 3-D simulations. The early stages of
the explosion (i.e., mass-accretion and initiation of the runaway) have been computed with the
1-D hydrodynamic code SHIVA. When convection extends throughout the entire envelope, the structures
for each model were mapped into 3-D Cartesian grids and were subsequently followed with the multidimensional
code FLASH. Two key physical quantities were extracted from the 3-D simulations and subsequently
implemented into SHIVA, which was used to complete the simulation through the late expansion and
ejection stages: the time-dependent amount of mass dredged-up from the outer white dwarf layers,
and the time-dependent convective velocity profile throughout the envelope. More massive envelopes
than those reported from previous models with pre-enrichment have been found. This results in more
violent outbursts, characterized by higher peak temperatures and greater ejected masses, with
metallicity enhancements in agreement with observations.
