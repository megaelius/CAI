Aims. The goal of the paper is to present a detailed study of the propagation of low velocity (5 to 25
km s-1) stationary molecular shocks in environments illuminated by an external ultraviolet (UV)
radiation field. In particular, we intend to show how the structure, dynamics, energetics, and
chemical properties of shocks are modified by UV photons and to estimate how efficiently shocks
can produce line emission. Methods. We implemented several key physico-chemical processes in
the Paris-Durham shock code to improve the treatment of the radiative transfer and its impact on
dust and gas particles. We propose a new integration algorithm to find the steady-state solutions
of magnetohydrodynamics equations in a range of parameters in which the fluid evolves from a supersonic
to a subsonic regime. We explored the resulting code over a wide range of physical conditions, which
encompass diffuse interstellar clouds and hot and dense photon-dominated regions (PDR). Results.
We find that C-type shock conditions cease to exist as soon as G0 > 0.2 (nH/cm-3)^1/2. Such conditions
trigger the emergence of another category of stationary solutions, called C*-type and CJ-type
shocks, in which the shocked gas is momentarily subsonic along its trajectory. These solutions
are shown to be unique for a given set of physical conditions and correspond to dissipative structures
in which the gas is heated up to temperatures comprised between those found in C-type and adiabatic
J-type shocks. High temperatures combined with the ambient UV field favour the production or excitation
of a few molecular species to the detriment of others, hence leading to specific spectroscopic tracers
such as rovibrational lines of H2 and rotational lines of CH+. Unexpectedly, the rotational lines
of CH+ may carry as much as several percent of the shock kinetic energy.
