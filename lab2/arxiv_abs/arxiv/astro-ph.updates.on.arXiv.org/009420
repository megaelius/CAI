Individual distances to planetary nebulae are of the utmost relevance for our understanding of
post-asymptotic giant-branch evolution because they allow a precise determination of stellar
and nebular properties. Also, objects with individual distances serve as calibrators for the so-called
statistical distances based on secondary nebular properties. With independently known distances,
it is possible to check empirically our understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary
nebulae as suggested by existing hydrodynamical simulations. We compared the expansion parallaxes
that have recently been determined for a number of planetary nebulae with the trigonometric parallaxes
provided by the Gaia Data Release 2. Except for two out of 11 nebulae, we found good agreement between
the expansion and the Gaia trigonometric parallaxes without any systematic trend with distance.
Therefore, the Gaia measurements also prove that the correction factors necessary to convert proper
motions of shocks into Doppler velocities cannot be ignored. Rather, the size of these correction
factors and their evolution with time as predicted by 1-D hydrodynamical models of planetary nebulae
is basically validated. These correction factors are generally greater than unity and are different
for the outer shell and the inner bright rim of a planetary nebula. The Gaia measurements also confirm
earlier findings that spectroscopic methods often lead to an overestimation of the distance. They
also show that even modelling of the entire system of star and nebula by means of sophisticated photoionization
modeling may not always provide reliable results. The Gaia measurements confirm the basic correctness
of the present radiation-hydrodynamics models, which predict that both the shell and the rim of
a planetary nebula are two independently expanding entities.
