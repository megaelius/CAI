Diffuse galactic gamma-ray emission is produced by the interaction of cosmic rays (CRs) with the
interstellar environment. The study of gamma-ray emission is therefore a powerful tool to investigate
the origin of CRs and the processes through which they are accelerated. We aim to gain deeper insights
of the nature of gamma-ray emission in the region of Orion, which is one of the best studied sites of
on-going star formation, by analysing data from the AGILE satellite. The diffuse gamma-ray emission
expected from the Orion region is relatively high. Its separation from the galactic plane also ensures
a very low contribution from foreground or background emission, which makes it an ideal site for
studying the processes of particle acceleration in star forming environments. The AGILE data are
modelled through a template that quantifies the gamma-ray diffuse emission expected from atomic
and molecular hydrogen. Other sources of emission are modelled as an isotropic contribution. Gamma-ray
emission exceeding the amount expected by the diffuse emission model is detected with high level
of significance. The main excess is in the high-longitude part of Orion A. A thorough analysis of
this feature suggests a connection between the observed gamma-ray emission and the B0.5 Ia star
k Orionis. The location of the gamma-ray excess is compatible with the site where stellar wind collides
with the ISM. Both scattering on dark gas and cosmic-ray acceleration at the shock between the two
environments are discussed as possible explanations, with the latter hypothesis being supported
by the hardness of the energy spectrum of the emission. If confirmed, this would be the first direct
detection of gamma-ray emission from the interaction between ISM and a single star's stellar wind.
