Supermassive black holes at the centre of galactic nuclei mostly grow in mass through gas accretion
over cosmic time. This process also modifies the angular momentum (or spin) of supermassive black
holes, both in magnitude and in orientation. Despite being often neglected in galaxy formation
simulations, spin plays a crucial role in modulating accretion power, driving jet feedback, and
determining recoil velocity of coalescing black hole binaries. We present a new accretion model
for the moving-mesh code AREPO that incorporates (i) mass accretion through a thin $\alpha$-disc,
and (ii) spin evolution through the Bardeen-Petterson effect. We use a diverse suite of idealised
simulations to explore the physical connection between spin evolution and larger scale environment.
We find that black holes $\lesssim 10^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$ experience quick alignment between the
black hole and the accretion disc, favouring prolonged phases of spin-up, and the spin direction
evolves according to the gas inflow on timescales as short as $\lesssim 100$ Myr, which might explain
the observed jet direction distribution in Seyfert galaxies. Heavier black holes ($\gtrsim 10^{8}$
M$_{\odot}$) are instead more sensitive to the local gas kinematic. Here we find a wider distribution
in spin magnitudes: spin-ups are favoured if gas inflow maintains a preferential direction, and
spin-downs occur for nearly isotropic infall, while the spin direction does not change much over
short timescales $\sim 100$ Myr. We therefore conclude that supermassive black holes with masses
$\gtrsim 5 \times 10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$ may be the ideal testbed to determine the main mode of black
hole fuelling over cosmic time.
