We investigate the dynamics of charged dust close to outer mean-motion resonances with planet Jupiter.
The importance of the interplanetary magnetic field on the orbital evolution of dust is clearly
demonstrated. New dynamical phenomena are found that do not exist in the classical problem of uncharged
dust. We find changes in the orientation of the orbital planes of dust particles, an increased amount
of chaotic orbital motions, sudden 'jumps' in the resonant argument, and a decrease in time of temporary
capture due to the Lorentz force. Variations in the orbital planes of dust grain orbits are found
to be related to the angle between the orbital angular momentum and magnetic axes of the heliospheric
field and the rotation rate of the Sun. These variations are bound using a simplified model derived
from the full dynamical problem using first order averaging theory. It is found that the interplanetary
magnetic field does not affect the capture process, that is still dominated by the other non-gravitational
forces. Our study is based on a dynamical model in the framework of the inclined circular restricted
three-body problem. Additional forces include solar radiation pressure, solar wind drag, the
Poynting-Robertson effect, and the influence of a Parker spiral type interplanetary magnetic
field model. The analytical estimates are derived on the basis of Gauss' form of planetary equations
of motion. Numerical results are obtained by simulations of dust grain orbits together with the
system of variational equations. Chaotic regions in phase space are revealed by means of Fast Lyapunov
Chaos Indicators.
