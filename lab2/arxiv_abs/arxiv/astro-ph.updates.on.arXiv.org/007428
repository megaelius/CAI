We have proposed a generation mechanism of non repeating ( repeating ) fast radio bursts: They arise
by axion star collisions with neutron stars ( accretion disks of galactic black holes ). The axion
star as coherent state of axions with mass $m_a$ generates homogeneous electric field oscillating
with frequency $m_a/2\pi$ under strong magnetic fields. The field makes electrons coherently
oscillate and emit the coherent dipole radiations ( FRBs ). The radiations stop when the oscillations
are disturbed by thermal fluctuations produced by the themalization of the oscillating energies.
Thus, the durations of the FRBs are determined by the time scale of the thermalization. We show that
it is much shorter than $1$ms. Line spectra of the dipole radiations are broadened by the thermal
effects. The thermally broaden spectra have a feature that the bandwidths $\delta\nu$ are proportional
to their center frequencies $\nu_c$; $\delta\nu \propto \nu_c$. Because the accretion disks can
orbit with relativistic velocities, the radiations are Doppler shifted. It leads to the presences
of various center frequencies ( $1.2$GHz$\sim $$7$GHz ) in repeating FRB121102. On the other hand,
non repeating FRBs do not show such variety of the center frequencies. They come from the surfaces
of neutron stars whose motions are non relativistic. The Doppler shift also makes the durations
of the bursts with higher frequencies become shorter. Because the magnetic fields of the neutron
stars are supposed to be stronger than those of the accretion disks, peak flux densities of non repeating
FRBs are larger than those of repeating FRB121102. The strong magnetic fields of the neutron stars
also lead to much wide bandwidths of non repeating FRBs, which are over the extent of the receiver
frequency range. We predict that the recently discovered FRB180725A is a new repeating FRB.
