Galaxy clusters are known to host many active galaxies (AGNs) with radio jets, which could expand
to form radio bubbles with relativistic electrons in the intracluster medium (ICM). It has been
suggested that fossil relativistic electrons contained in remnant bubbles from extinct radio
galaxies can be re-accelerated to radio-emitting energies by merger-driven shocks via diffusive
shock acceleration (DSA), leading to the birth of radio relics detected in clusters. In this study
we assume that such bubble consist primarily of thermal gas entrained from the surrounding medium
and dynamically-insignificant amounts of relativistic electrons. We also consider several realistic
models for magnetic fields in the cluster outskirts, including the ICM field that scales with the
gas density as $B_{\rm ICM}\propto n_{\rm ICM}^{0.5}$. Then we perform time-dependent DSA simulations
of a spherical shock that runs into a lower-density but higher-temperature bubble with the ratio
$n_{\rm b}/n_{\rm ICM} \approx T_{\rm ICM}/T_{\rm b}\approx 0.5$. We find that inside the bubble
the shock speed increases by about 20 \%, but the Mach number decreases by about 15\% in the case under
consideration. In this re-acceleration model, the observed properties of a radio relic such as
radio flux, spectral index, and integrated spectrum would be governed mainly by the presence of
seed relativistic electrons and the magnetic field profile as well as shock dynamics. Thus it is
crucial to understand how fossil electrons are deposited by AGNs in the ICM and how the downstream
magnetic field evolves behind the shock in detailed modeling of radio relics.
