Using the Ly$\alpha$ mass assignment scheme (LyMAS), we make theoretical predictions for the 3-dimensional
3-point correlation function (3PCF) of the Ly$\alpha$ forest at redshift $z=2.3$. We bootstrap
results from the (100 $h^{-1} \mbox{ Mpc}$)$^3$ Horizon hydrodynamic simulation to a (1 $h^{-1}$
Gpc)$^3$ $N$-body simulation, considering both a uniform UV background (UVB) and a fluctuating
UVB sourced by quasars with a comoving $n_q \approx 10^{-5}$ $h^3$ Mpc$^{-3}$ placed either in massive
halos or randomly. On scales of $10-30$ $h^{-1} \mbox{ Mpc}$, the flux 3PCF displays hierarchical
scaling with the square of the 2PCF, but with an unusual value of $Q \equiv \zeta_{123}/(\xi_{12}
\xi_{13} + \xi_{12} \xi_{23} + \xi_{13} \xi_{23}) \approx -4.5$ that reflects the low bias of the
Ly$\alpha$ forest and the anti-correlation between mass density and transmitted flux. For halo-based
quasars and an ionizing photon mean free path of $\lambda = 300$ $h^{-1} \mbox{ Mpc}$ comoving, UVB
fluctuations moderately depress the 2PCF and 3PCF, with cancelling effects on $Q$. For $\lambda
= 100$ $h^{-1} \mbox{ Mpc}$ or 50 $h^{-1} \mbox{ Mpc}$, UVB fluctuations substantially boost the
2PCF and 3PCF on large scales, shifting the hierarchical ratio to $Q \approx -3$. We scale our simulation
results to derive rough estimate of the 3PCF detectability in observational data sets for the redshift
range $z=2.1 - 2.6$. At $r = 10$ $h^{-1} \mbox{ Mpc}$ and 20 $h^{-1} \mbox{ Mpc}$, we predict a signal-to-noise
(SNR) of $\sim$ 9 and $\sim$ 7, respectively, for both BOSS and eBOSS, and $\sim$ 37 and $\sim$ 25 for
DESI. At $r = 40$ $h^{-1} \mbox{ Mpc}$ the predicted SNR is lower by $\sim$ 3$-$5 times. Measuring
the flux 3PCF would be a novel test of the conventional paradigm of the Ly$\alpha$ forest and help
separate the contributions of UVB fluctuations and density fluctuations to Ly$\alpha$ forest
clustering.
