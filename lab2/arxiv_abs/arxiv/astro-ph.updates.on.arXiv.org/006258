Using high-quality optical images from the Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey, we perform multi-component
decompositions of S0 galaxies to derive accurate structural parameters to constrain their physical
origin. Many S0s do not host prominent bulges. S0 galaxies have a broad distribution of bulge-to-total
ratios ($B/T$) and S\'ersic indices ($n$), with average values of $B/T=0.34\pm0.15$ and $n=2.62\pm1.02$,
qualitatively consistent with the notion that S0s define a parallel sequence with and may have evolved
from spiral galaxies. This is further reinforced by the incidence of bars and lenses in S0s, which
when compared with the statistics in spirals, supports the idea that lenses are demised bars. However,
despite their wide range of prominence, the bulges of S0s form a surprisingly uniform sequence on
both the Kormendy and fundamental plane relations. There is no evidence for population dichotomy
or other indications of differentiation into classical and pseudo bulges. Most of the S0s reside
in the field and in groups; cluster environment is not a necessary condition for S0 production. The
properties of S0 bulges show little correlation with environmental indicators, after the dependence
of galaxy stellar mass on environment is taken into account. As the bulges of late-type spirals and
S0s are intrinsically different, and environmental effects that may account for such evolution
appear to be minimal, we conclude that late-type spirals are not plausible progenitors of S0s. The
bulges of S0s likely formed at an early epoch, after which secular processes contributed little
to their subsequent evolution.
