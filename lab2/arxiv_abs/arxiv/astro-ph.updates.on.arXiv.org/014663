The usage of the radius-luminosity (R-L) relation for the determination of black hole masses across
the cosmic history as well as its application for cosmological studies motivates us to analyze its
scatter, which has recently increased significantly both for the optical (H$\beta$) and UV (Mg
II) lines. To this purpose, we determined the scatter along the R-L relation for an up-to-date reverberation-mapped
Mg II sample. Studying linear combinations of the luminosity at 3000 A with independent parameters
such as the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM), Fe II strength (R$_\mathrm{FeII}$), and the fractional
variability ($F\mathrm{_{var}}$) for the whole sample, we get only a small decrease in the scatter
($\sigma{_{\rm rms}}=0.29-0.30$ dex). Linear combinations with the dimensionless accretion
rate ($\dot{\mathcal{M}}$) and the Eddington ratio ($\alpha_\mathrm{Edd}$) lead to significant
reductions of the scatter ($\sigma_{\rm rms}\sim 0.1$ dex), albeit both suffering from the inter-dependency
on the observed time-delay. After the division into two sub-samples considering the median value
of the $\dot{\mathcal{M}}$ in the full sample, we find that the scatter decreases significantly
for the highly accreting sub-sample. In particular, the smallest scatter of $\sigma{_{\rm rms}}=0.17$
dex is associated with the independent parameter R$_\mathrm{FeII}$, followed by the combination
with $F\mathrm{_{var}}$, with $\sigma{_{\rm rms}}=0.19$ dex. Both of these independent observationally-inferred
parameters are in turn correlated with $\dot{\mathcal{M}}$ and $\alpha_\mathrm{Edd}$. These
results suggest that the large scatter along the R-L relation is driven $\textit{mainly}$ by the
accretion rate intensity.
