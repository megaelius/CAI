One of the key questions in Astrophysics concerns the issue of whether there exists an upper-mass
limit to stars, and if so, what physical mechanism sets this limit, which might also determine if
the upper-mass limit is metallicity (Z) dependent. We argue that mass loss by radiation-driven
winds mediated by line opacity is one of the prime candidates setting the upper-mass limit. We present
mass-loss predictions (dM/dt_wind) from Monte Carlo radiative transfer models for relatively
cool (Teff = 15kK) inflated very massive stars (VMS) with large Eddington Gamma factors in the mass
range 100-1000 Msun as a function of metallicity down to 1/100 Z/Zsun. We employ a hydrodynamic version
of our Monte Carlo method, allowing us to predict the rate of mass loss (dM/dt_wind) and the terminal
wind velocity (vinf) simultaneously. Interestingly, we find wind terminal velocities (vinf)
that are low (100-500 km/s) over a wide Z-range, and we propose that the slow winds from VMS are an important
source of self-enrichment in globular clusters. We also find mass-loss rates (dM/dt_wind), exceeding
the typical mass-accretion rate (dM/dt_accr) of 0.001 Msun/yr during massive-star formation.
We express our mass-loss predictions as a function of mass and Z, finding log dM/dt = -9.13 + 2.1 log(M/Msun)
+ 0.74 log(Z/Zsun) (Msun/yr). Even if stellar winds would not directly halt & reverse mass accretion
during star formation, if the most massive stars form by stellar mergers stellar wind mass loss may
dominate over the rate at which stellar growth takes place. We therefore argue that the upper-mass
limit is effectively Z-dependent due to the nature of radiation-driven winds. This has dramatic
consequences for the most luminous supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and other black hole formation
scenarios at different Cosmic epochs.
