Estimates of the source parameters of gravitational-wave (GW) events produced by compact binary
mergers rely on theoretical models for the GW signal. We present the first frequency-domain model
for inspiral, merger and ringdown of the GW signal from precessing binary-black-hole systems that
also includes multipoles beyond the leading-order quadrupole. Our model, {\tt PhenomPv3HM},
is a combination of the higher-multipole non-precessing model {\tt PhenomHM} and the spin-precessing
model {\tt PhenomPv3} that includes two-spin precession via a dynamical rotation of the GW multipoles.
We validate the new model by comparing to a large set of precessing numerical-relativity simulations
and find excellent agreement across the majority of the parameter space they cover. For mass ratios
$<5$ the mismatch improves, on average, from $\sim6\%$ to $\sim 2\%$ compared to {\tt PhenomPv3}
when we include higher multipoles in the model. However, we find mismatches $\sim8\%$ for the mass-ratio
$6$ and highly spinning simulation. As a first application of the new model we have analysed the binary
black hole event GW170729. We find larger values for the primary black hole mass of $58.25^{+11.73}_{-12.53}
\, M_\odot$ (90\% credible interval). The lower limit ($\sim 46 \, M_\odot$) is comparable to the
proposed maximum black hole mass predicted by different stellar evolution models due to the pulsation
pair-instability supernova (PPISN) mechanism. If we assume that the primary \ac{BH} in GW170729
formed through a PPISN then out of the four PPISN models we considered only the model of Woosley (2017)
is consistent with our mass measurements at the 90\% level.
