The reionization of hydrogen is closely linked to the first structures in the universe, so understanding
the timeline of reionization promises to shed light on the nature of these early objects. In particular,
transmission of Lyman alpha (Ly$\alpha$) from galaxies through the intergalactic medium (IGM)
is sensitive to neutral hydrogen in the IGM, so can be used to probe the reionization timeline. In
this work, we implement an improved model of the galaxy UV luminosity to dark matter halo mass relation
to infer the volume-averaged fraction of neutral hydrogen in the IGM from Ly$\alpha$ observations.
Many models assume that UV-bright galaxies are hosted by massive dark matter haloes in overdense
regions of the IGM, so reside in relatively large ionized regions. However, observations and N-body
simulations indicate that scatter in the UV luminosity-halo mass relation is expected. Here, we
model the scatter (though we assume the IGM topology is unaffected) and assess the impact on Ly$\alpha$
visibility during reionization. We show that UV luminosity-halo mass scatter reduces Ly$\alpha$
visibility compared to models without scatter, and that this is most significant for UV-bright
galaxies. We then use our model with scatter to infer the neutral fraction, $\overline{x}_{\mathrm{HI}}$,
at $z \sim 7$ using a sample of Lyman-break galaxies in legacy fields. We infer $\overline{x}_{\mathrm{HI}}
= 0.55_{-0.13}^{+0.11}$ with scatter, compared to $\overline{x}_{\mathrm{HI}} = 0.59_{-0.14}^{+0.12}$
without scatter, a very slight decrease and consistent within the uncertainties. Finally, we place
our results in the context of other constraints on the reionization timeline and discuss implications
for future high-redshift galaxy studies.
