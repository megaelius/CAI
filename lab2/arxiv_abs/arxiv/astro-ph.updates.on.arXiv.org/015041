Spatially resolved continuum observations of planet-forming disks show prominent ring and gap
structures in their dust distribution. However, the picture from gas observations is much less
clear and constraints on the radial gas density structure (i.e. gas gaps) remain rare and uncertain.
We want to investigate the importance of thermo-chemical processes for the interpretation of high-spatial-resolution
gas observations of planet-forming disks and their impact on derived gas properties. We apply the
radiation thermo-chemical disk code ProDiMo (PROtoplanetary DIsk MOdel) to model self-consistently
the dust and gas disk of HD 163296, using the DSHARP gas and dust observations. With this model we investigate
the impact of dust gaps and gas gaps, considering chemistry and heating/cooling processes, on the
observables and the derived gas properties. We find distinct peaks in the radial line intensity
profiles of the CO line data of HD 163296 at the location of the dust gaps. Our model indicates that
those peaks are not only a consequence of a gas temperature increase within the gaps but are mainly
caused by the absorption of line emission from the back side of the disk by the dust rings. For two of
the three prominent dust gaps in HD 163296, we find that thermo-chemical effects are negligible
for deriving density gradients via measurements of the rotation velocity. However, for the gap
with the highest dust depletion, the temperature gradient can be dominant and needs to be considered
to derive accurate gas density profiles. Self-consistent gas and dust thermo-chemical modelling
in combination with high-quality observations of multiple molecules are necessary to accurately
derive gas gap depths and shapes. This is crucial to determine the origin of gaps and rings in planet-forming
disks and to improve the mass estimates of forming planets if they are the cause of the gap.
