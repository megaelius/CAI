We investigate axisymmetric black hole (BH) formation and its gravitational wave and neutrino
signals with self-consistent core-collapse supernova simulations of a non-rotating $40 M_\odot$
progenitor star using the isotropic diffusion source approximation for the transport of electron
flavor neutrinos and anti-neutrinos and a modified gravitational potential for general relativistic
effects. We consider four different neutron star equations of state: LS220, SFHo, BHB$\Lambda\phi$
and DD2, and study the impact of the equation of state on BH formation dynamics and gravitational
wave emission. We find that the BH formation time is sensitive to the equation of state and is delayed
in multiple dimensions due to the finite entropy effects, that enlarge the maximum proto-neutron
star (PNS) mass and PNS convection. Depending on the equation of state, our simulations show the
possibility that shock revival can occur along with the collapse of the PNS to a BH. The gravitational
waveforms contain four major features: 1) a low frequency signal from core-bounce and prompt convection,
2) a strong signal from the PNS g-mode oscillation, 3) a high frequency signal from the PNS inner core
convection, 4) signals from the standing accretion shock instability and convection. The peak
frequency at the onset of BH formation reaches to $\sim 2.3$~kHz. The characteristic amplitude
of a 10~kpc object at peak frequency is detectable but close to the noise threshold of the Advanced
LIGO and KAGRA, suggesting that the next generation gravitational wave detector will need to improve
the sensitivity at kHz domain to better observe stellar mass BH formation from core-collapse supernovae
or failed supernovae.
