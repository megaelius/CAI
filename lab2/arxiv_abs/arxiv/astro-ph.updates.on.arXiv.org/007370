ATLAS (Astrophysics Telescope for Large Area Spectroscopy) Probe is a concept for a NASA probe-class
space mission. It is the follow-up space mission to WFIRST, boosting its scientific return by obtaining
deep IR slit spectroscopy for 70% of all galaxies imaged by a 2000 sq deg WFIRST High Latitude Survey
at z>0.5. ATLAS will measure accurate and precise redshifts for 200M galaxies out to z < 7, and deliver
spectra that enable a wide range of diagnostic studies of the physical properties of galaxies over
most of cosmic history. ATLAS Probe science spans four broad categories: (1) Revolutionizing galaxy
evolution studies by tracing the relation between galaxies and dark matter from galaxy groups to
cosmic voids and filaments, from the epoch of reionization through the peak era of galaxy assembly;
(2) Opening a new window into the dark Universe by weighing the dark matter filaments using 3D weak
lensing with spectroscopic redshifts, and obtaining definitive measurements of dark energy and
modification of General Relativity using galaxy clustering; (3) Probing the Milky Way's dust-enshrouded
regions, reaching the far side of our Galaxy; and (4) Exploring the formation history of the outer
Solar System by characterizing Kuiper Belt Objects. ATLAS Probe is a 1.5m telescope with a field
of view of 0.4 sq deg, and uses Digital Micro-mirror Devices (DMDs) as slit selectors. It has a spectroscopic
resolution of R = 1000 over 1-4 microns, and a spectroscopic multiplex factor >5,000. ATLAS is designed
to fit within the NASA probe-class space mission cost envelope; it has a single instrument, a telescope
aperture that allows for a lighter launch vehicle, and mature technology. ATLAS Probe will lead
to transformative science over the entire range of astrophysics: from galaxy evolution to the dark
Universe, from Solar System objects to the dusty regions of the Milky Way.
