Here we present a radio continuum study based on new and archival data from the Australia Telescope
Compact Array towards N 103B, a young (<=1000 yrs) spectroscopically confirmed type Ia SNR in the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and proposed to have originated from a single degenerate progenitor.
The radio morphology of this SNR is asymmetrical with two bright regions towards the north-west
and south-west of the central location as defined by radio emission. N 103B identified features
include: a radio spectral index of -0.75+-0.01 (consistent with other young type Ia SNRs in the Galaxy);
a bulk SNR expansion rate as in X-rays; morphology and polarised electrical field vector measurements
where we note radial polarisation peak towards the north-west of the remnant at both 5500 and 9000
MHz. The spectrum is concave-up and the most likely reason is the non-linear diffusive shock acceleration
effects or presence of two different populations of ultra-relativistic electrons. We also note
unpolarized clumps near the south-west region which is in agreement with this above scenario. We
derive a typical magnetic field strength for N 103B, of 16.4 microG for an average rotation measurement
of 200 rad m^-2. However, we estimate the equipartition field to be of the order of ~235 microG with
an estimated minimum energy of Emin=6.3*10^48 erg. The close (~0.5 degree) proximity of N 103B to
the LMC mid-plane indicates that an early encounter with dense interstellar medium may have set
an important constrain on SNR evolution. Finally, we compare features of N 103B, to six other young
type Ia SNRs in the LMC and Galaxy, with a range of proposed degeneracy scenarios to highlight potential
differences due to a different models. We suggest that the single degenerate scenario might point
to morphologically asymmetric type Ia supernova explosions.
