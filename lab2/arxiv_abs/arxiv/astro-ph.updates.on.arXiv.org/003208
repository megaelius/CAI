The kinematics and dynamics of young stellar populations enable us to test theories of star formation.
With this aim, we continue our analysis of the SDSS-III/APOGEE IN-SYNC survey, a high resolution
near infrared spectroscopic survey of young clusters. We focus on the Orion A star-forming region,
for which IN-SYNC obtained spectra of $\sim2700$ stars. In Paper IV we used these data to study the
young stellar population. Here we study the kinematic properties through radial velocities ($v_r$).
The young stellar population remains kinematically associated with the molecular gas, following
a $\sim10\:{\rm{km\:s}}^{-1}$ gradient along filament. However, near the center of the region,
the $v_r$ distribution is slightly blueshifted and asymmetric; we suggest that this population,
which is older, is slightly in foreground. We find evidence for kinematic subclustering, detecting
statistically significant groupings of co-located stars with coherent motions. These are mostly
in the lower-density regions of the cloud, while the ONC radial velocities are smoothly distributed,
consistent with it being an older, more dynamically evolved cluster. The velocity dispersion $\sigma_v$
varies along the filament. The ONC appears virialized, or just slightly supervirial, consistent
with an old dynamical age. Here there is also some evidence for on-going expansion, from a $v_r$--extinction
correlation. In the southern filament, $\sigma_v$ is $\sim2$--$3$ times larger than virial in
the L1641N region, where we infer a superposition along the line of sight of stellar sub-populations,
detached from the gas. On the contrary, $\sigma_v$ decreases towards L1641S, where the population
is again in agreement with a virial state.
