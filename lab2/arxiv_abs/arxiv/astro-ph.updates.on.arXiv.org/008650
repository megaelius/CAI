We study the properties of 30 spectroscopically-identified pairs of galaxies observed during
the peak epoch of star formation in the universe. These systems are drawn from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution
Field (MOSDEF) Survey at $1.4 \leq z \leq 3.8$, and are interpreted as early-stage galaxy mergers.
Galaxy pairs in our sample are identified as two objects whose spectra were collected on the same
Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopic slit. Accordingly, all pairs in the sample have projected separations
$R_{{\rm proj}}\leq 60$ kpc. The velocity separation for pairs was required to be $\Delta v \leq
500 \mbox{ km s}^{-1}$, which is a standard threshold for defining interacting galaxy pairs at low
redshift. Stellar mass ratios in our sample range from 1.1 to 550, with 12 ratios closer than or equal
to 3:1, the common definition of a "major merger." Studies of merging pairs in the local universe
indicate anenhancement in star-formation activity and deficit in gas-phase oxygen abundance
relative to isolated galaxies of the same mass. We compare the MOSDEF pairs sample to a control sample
of isolated galaxies at the same redshift, finding no measurable SFR enhancement or metallicity
deficit at fixed stellar mass for the pairs sample. The lack of significant difference between the
average properties of pairs and control samples appears in contrast to results from low-redshift
studies, although the small sample size and lower signal-to-noise of the high-redshift data limit
definitive conclusions on redshift evolution. These results are consistent with some theoretical
works suggesting a reduced differential effect of pre-coalescence mergers on galaxy properties
at high redshift -- specifically that pre-coalescence mergers do not drive strong starbursts.
