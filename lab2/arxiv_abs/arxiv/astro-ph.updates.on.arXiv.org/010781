We investigate the spectra, material properties, and orbital distribution of millimeter- to decimeter-sized
meteoroids. Our study aims to distinguish the characteristics of populations of differently sized
meteoroids and reveal the heterogeneity of identified meteoroid streams. We verify the surprisingly
large ratio of pure iron meteoroids on asteroidal orbits detected among mm-sized bodies. Emission
spectra and multi-station meteor trajectories were collected within the AMOS network observations.
The sample is based on 202 meteors of -1 to -14 magnitude, corresponding to meteoroids of mm to dm sizes.
Meteoroid composition is studied by relative intensity ratios of Na, Mg, and Fe. Heliocentric orbits,
trajectory parameters, and material strengths inferred from empirical $K_B$ and $P_E$ parameters
were determined for 146 meteoroids. An overall increase of Na content compared to the population
of mm-sized meteoroids was detected, reflecting weaker effects of space weathering processes
on larger meteoroids. We report a very low ratio of pure iron meteoroids and the discovery of a new
spectral group of Fe-rich meteors. The majority of meteoroids on asteroidal orbits were found to
be chondritic. Thermal processes causing Na depletion and physical processes resulting in Na-rich
spectra are described and linked to characteristically increased material strengths. Numerous
major and minor shower meteors were identified in our sample, revealing various degrees of heterogeneity
within Halley-type, ecliptical, and sungrazing meteoroid streams. Our results imply a scattered
composition of the fragments of comet 2P/Encke and 109P/Swift-Tuttle. The largest disparities
were detected within the $\alpha$-Capricornids and $\delta$-Aquarids. We also find a spectral
similarity between $\kappa$-Cygnids and Taurids, which could imply a similar composition of the
parent objects of the two streams.
