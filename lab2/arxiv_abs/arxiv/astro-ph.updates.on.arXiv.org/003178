Dust devils are likely the dominant source of dust for the martian atmosphere, but the amount and
frequency of dust-lifting depend on the statistical distribution of dust devil parameters. Dust
devils exhibit pressure perturbations and, if they pass near a barometric sensor, they may register
as a discernible dip in a pressure time-series. Leveraging this fact, several surveys using barometric
sensors on landed spacecraft have revealed dust devil structures and occurrence rates. However
powerful they are, though, such surveys suffer from non-trivial biases that skew the inferred dust
devil properties. For example, such surveys are most sensitive to dust devils with the widest and
deepest pressure profiles, but the recovered profiles will be distorted, broader and shallow than
the actual profiles. In addition, such surveys often do not provide wind speed measurements alongside
the pressure time series, and so the durations of the dust devil signals in the time series cannot
be directly converted to profile widths. Fortunately, simple statistical and geometric considerations
can de-bias these surveys, allowing conversion of the duration of dust devil signals into physical
widths, given only a distribution of likely translation velocities, and the recovery of the underlying
distributions of physical parameters. In this study, we develop a scheme for de-biasing such surveys.
Applying our model to an in-situ survey using data from the Phoenix lander suggests a larger dust
flux and a dust devil occurrence rate about ten times larger than previously inferred. Comparing
our results to dust devil track surveys suggests only about one in five low-pressure cells lifts
sufficient dust to leave a visible track.
