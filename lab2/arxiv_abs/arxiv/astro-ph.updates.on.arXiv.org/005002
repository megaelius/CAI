We present a study of observed Type II supernova (SN~II) colours using optical/near-infrared photometric
data from the \textit{Carnegie Supernovae Project-I}. We analyse four colours ($B-V$, $u-g$,
$g-r$, and $g-Y$) and find that SN~II colour curves can be described by two linear regimes during
the photospheric phase. The first ($s_{\rm 1,colour}$) is steeper and has a median duration of $\sim
40$ days. The second, shallower slope ($s_{\rm 2,colour}$) lasts until the end of the "plateau"
($\sim 80$ days). The two slopes correlate in the sense that steeper initial colour curves also imply
steeper colour curves at later phases. As suggested by recent studies, SNe~II form a continuous
population of objects from the colour point of view as well. We investigate correlations between
the observed colours and a range of photometric and spectroscopic parameters including the absolute
magnitude, the $V$-band light-curve slopes, and metal-line strengths. We find that less luminous
SNe~II appear redder, a trend that we argue is not driven by uncorrected host-galaxy reddening.
While there is significant dispersion, we find evidence that redder SNe~II (mainly at early epochs)
display stronger metal-line equivalent widths. Host-galaxy reddening does not appear to be a dominant
parameter, neither driving observed trends nor dominating the dispersion in observed colours.
Intrinsic SN~II colours are most probably dominated by photospheric temperature differences,
with progenitor metallicity possibly playing a minor role. Such temperature differences could
be related to differences in progenitor radius, together with the presence or absence of circumstellar
material close to the progenitor stars.
