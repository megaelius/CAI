We report the detection of new binary black hole merger events in the publicly available data from
the second observing run of advanced LIGO and advanced Virgo (O2). The mergers were discovered using
the new search pipeline described in Venumadhav et al. [Phys. Rev. D 100, 023011 (2019)], and are
above the detection thresholds as defined in Abbott et al. (LIGO Scientific and Virgo Collaborations)
[Phys. Rev. X 9, 031040 (2019).] Three of the mergers (GW170121, GW170304, GW170727) have inferred
probabilities of being of astrophysical origin $p_{\rm astro} > 0.98$. The remaining three (GW170425,
GW170202, GW170403) are less certain, with $p_{\rm astro}$ ranging from 0.5 to 0.8. The newly found
mergers largely share the statistical properties of previously reported events, with the exception
of GW170403, the least secure event, which has a highly negative effective spin parameter $\chi_{\rm
eff}$ . The most secure new event, GW170121 ($p_{\rm astro} > 0.99$), is also notable due to its inferred
negative value of $\chi_{\rm eff}$, which is inconsistent with being positive at the ~95.8% confidence
level. The new mergers nearly double the sample of gravitational wave events reported from O2, and
present a substantial opportunity to explore the statistics of the binary black hole population
in the Universe. The number of detected events is not surprising since we estimate that the detection
volume of our pipeline may be larger than that of other pipelines by as much as a factor of two (with
significant uncertainties in the estimate). The increase in volume is larger when the constituent
detectors of the network have very different sensitivities, as is likely to be the case in current
and future runs.
