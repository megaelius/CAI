We present orbital elements and mass sums for eighteen visual binary stars of spectral types B to
K (five of which are new orbits) with periods ranging from 20 to more than 500 yr. For two double-line
spectroscopic binaries with no previous orbits, the individual component masses, using combined
astrometric and radial velocity data, have a formal uncertainty of ~0.1 MSun. Adopting published
photometry, and trigonometric parallaxes, plus our own measurements, we place these objects on
an H-R diagram, and discuss their evolutionary status. These objects are part of a survey to characterize
the binary population of stars in the Southern Hemisphere, using the SOAR 4m telescope+HRCAM at
CTIO. Orbital elements are computed using a newly developed Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm
that delivers maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters, as well as posterior probability
density functions that allow us to evaluate the uncertainty of our derived parameters in a robust
way. For spectroscopic binaries, using our approach, it is possible to derive a self-consistent
parallax for the system from the combined astrometric plus radial velocity data ("orbital parallax"),
which compares well with the trigonometric parallaxes. We also present a mathematical formalism
that allows a dimensionality reduction of the feature space from seven to three search parameters
(or from ten to seven dimensions - including parallax - in the case of spectroscopic binaries with
astrometric data), which makes it possible to explore a smaller number of parameters in each case,
improving the computational efficiency of our Markov Chain Monte Carlo code.
