The high-quality OmegaCAM photometry of the 3x3 deg around the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) in r, and
i filters by Beccari et al.(2017) revealed three well-separated pre-main sequences in the color-magnitude
diagram (CMD). The objects belonging to the individual sequences are concentrated towards the
center of the ONC. The authors concluded that there are two competitive scenarios: a population
of unresolved binaries and triples with an exotic mass ratio distribution, or three stellar populations
with different ages. We use Gaia DR2 in combination with the photometric OmegaCAM catalog to test
and confirm the presence of the putative three stellar populations. We also study multiple stellar
systems in the ONC for the first time using Gaia DR2. We confirm that the second and third sequence
members are more centrally concentrated towards the center of the ONC. In addition we find an indication
that the parallax and proper motion distributions are different among the members of the stellar
sequences. The age difference among stellar populations is estimated to be 1-2 Myr. We use Gaia measurements
to identify and remove as many unresolved multiple system candidates as possible. Nevertheless
we are still able to recover two well-separated sequences with evidence for the third one, supporting
the existence of the three stellar populations. We were able to identify a substantial number of
wide binary objects (separation between 1000-3000 au). This challenges previously inferred values
that suggested no wide binary stars exist in the ONC. Our inferred wide-binary fraction is approx
5%. We confirm the three populations correspond to three separated episodes of star formation.
Based on this result, we conclude that star formation is not happening in a single burst in this region.
