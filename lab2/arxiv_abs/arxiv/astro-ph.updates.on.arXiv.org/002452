We analyze the stellar populations of a sample of 62 massive (log Mstar/Msun > 10.7) galaxies
in the redshift range 1 < z < 1.6, with the main goal of investigating the role of recent quenching
in the size growth of quiescent galaxies. We demonstrate that our sample is not biased toward bright,
compact, or young galaxies, and thus is representative of the overall quiescent population. Our
high signal-to-noise ratio Keck LRIS spectra probe the rest-frame Balmer break region which contains
important absorption line diagnostics of recent star formation activity. We show that improved
measures of the stellar population parameters, including the star-formation timescale tau, age
and dust extinction, can be determined by fitting templates jointly to our spectroscopic and broad-band
photometric data. These parameter fits allow us to backtrack the evolving trajectory of individual
galaxies on the UVJ color-color plane. In addition to identifying which quiescent galaxies were
recently quenched, we discover important variations in the star formation history of quiescent
galaxies indicating the likelihood of more than one quenching route. By using sizes measured in
the previous paper of this series, we confirm that the largest galaxies are indeed among the youngest
at a given redshift, an effect consistent with some contribution to the apparent growth from recent
arrivals. However, we calculate that recently-quenched objects can only be responsible for about
half of the increase in the average size of quiescent galaxies over a 1.5 Gyr period corresponding
to the redshift interval 1.25 < z < 2. The remainder of the observed size evolution arises from
a genuine growth of long-standing quiescent galaxies. We discuss the prospects of determining
whether the combination of minor merging and progenitor bias can explain the remarkably fast apparent
growth rate during this short period of cosmic history.
