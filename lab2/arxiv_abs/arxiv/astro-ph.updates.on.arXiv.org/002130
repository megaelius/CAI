Globular clusters are unique tracers of ancient star formation. We determine the formation efficiencies
of globular clusters across cosmic time by modeling the formation and dynamical evolution of the
globular cluster population of a Milky Way type galaxy in hierarchical cosmology, using the merger
tree from the Via Lactea II simulation. All of the models are constrained to reproduce the observed
specific frequency and initial mass function of globular clusters in isolated dwarfs. Globular
cluster orbits are then computed in a time varying gravitational potential after they are either
accreted from a satellite halo or formed in situ, within the Milky Way halo. We find that the Galactocentric
distances and metallicity distribution of globular clusters are very sensitive to the formation
efficiencies of globular clusters as a function of redshift and halo mass. Our most accurate models
reveal two distinct peaks in the globular cluster formation efficiency at z~2 and z~7-12 and prefer
a formation efficiency that is mildly increasing with decreasing halo mass, the opposite of what
expected for feedback-regulated star formation. This model accurately reproduces the positions,
velocities, mass function, metallicity distribution, and age distribution of globular clusters
in the Milky Way and predicts that ~ 40% formed in situ, within the Milky Way halo, while the other ~
60% were accreted from about 20 satellite dwarf galaxies with Vc > 30 km/s, and about 29% or all
globular clusters formed at redshifts z > 7. These results further strengthen the notion that
globular cluster formation was an important mode of star formation in high-redshift galaxies and
likely played a significant role in the reionization of the intergalactic medium
