The Dawn spacecraft observed the presence of dark material, which in turn proved to be associated
with OH and H-rich material, on the surface of Vesta. The source of this dark material has been identified
with the low albedo asteroids, but it is still a matter of debate whether the delivery of the dark material
is associated with a few large impact events, to micrometeorites or to the continuous, secular flux
of impactors on Vesta. The continuous flux scenario predicts that a significant fraction of the
exogenous material accreted by Vesta should be due to non-dark impactors likely analogous to ordinary
chondrites, which instead represent only a minor contaminant in the HED meteorites. We explored
the continuous flux scenario and its implications for the composition of the vestan regolith, taking
advantage of the data from the Dawn mission and the HED meteorites. We used our model to show that the
stochastic events scenario and the micrometeoritic flux scenario are natural consequences of
the continuous flux scenario. We then used the model to estimate the amounts of dark and hydroxylate
materials delivered on Vesta since the LHB and we showed how our results match well with the values
estimated by the Dawn mission. We used our model to assess the amount of Fe and siderophile elements
that the continuous flux of impactors would mix in the vestan regolith: concerning the siderophile
elements, we focused our attention on the role of Ni. The results are in agreement with the data available
on the Fe and Ni content of the HED meteorites and can be used as a reference frame in future studies
of the data from the Dawn mission and of the HED meteorites. Our model cannot yet provide an answer
to the fate of the missing non-carbonaceous contaminants, but we discuss possible reasons for this
discrepancy.
