We present the results of ammonia observations toward the center of NGC 3079. The NH3(J, K) = (1, 1)
and (2, 2) inversion lines were detected in absorption with the Tsukuba 32-m telescope, and the NH3(1,1)
through (6,6) lines with the VLA, although the profile of NH3(3,3) was in emission in contrast to
the other transitions. The background continuum source, whose flux density was ~50 mJy, could not
be resolved with the VLA beam of ~< 0."09 x 0."08. All ammonia absorption lines have two distinct
velocity components: one is at the systemic velocity and the other is blueshifted, and both components
are aligned along the nuclear jets. For the systemic components, the relatively low temperature
gas is extended more than the high temperature gas. The blueshifted NH3(3,3) emission can be regarded
as ammonia masers associated with shocks by strong winds probably from newly formed massive stars
or supernova explosions in dense clouds in the nuclear megamaser disk. Using para-NH3(1,1), (2,2),
(4,4) and (5,5) lines with VLA, we derived the rotational temperature Trot = 120 +- 12 K and 157 +- 19
K for the systemic and blueshifted components, respectively. The total column densities of NH3(0,0)-(6,6),
assuming Tex ~Trot, were (8.85+-0.70) x 10^16 cm^-2 and (4.47+-0.78) x 10^16 cm-2 for the systemic
and blueshifted components, respectively. The fractional abundance of NH3 relative to molecular
hydrogen H2 for the systemic and blueshifted was [NH3]/[H2]=1.3x10^-7 and 6.5 x 10^-8, respectively.
We also found the F = 4-4 and F = 5-5 doublet lines of OH 2{Pi}3/2 J = 9/2 in absorption, which could be
fitted by two velocity components, systemic and redshifted components. The rotational temperature
of OH was estimated to be Trot,OH >~ 175 K, tracing hot gas associated with the interaction of the
fast nuclear outflow with dense molecular material around the nucleus.
