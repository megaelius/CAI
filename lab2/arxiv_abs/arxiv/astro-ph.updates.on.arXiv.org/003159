We study lithium depletion in low-mass and solar-like stars as a function of time, using a new diffusion
coefficient describing extra-mixing taking place at the bottom of a convective envelope. This
new form is motivated by multi-dimensional fully compressible, time implicit hydrodynamic simulations
performed with the MUSIC code. Intermittent convective mixing at the convective boundary in a star
can be modeled using extreme value theory, a statistical analysis frequently used for finance,
meteorology, and environmental science. In this letter, we implement this statistical diffusion
coefficient in a one-dimensional stellar evolution code, using parameters calibrated from multi-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations of a young low-mass star. We propose a new scenario that can explain observations
of the surface abundance of lithium in the Sun and in clusters covering a wide range of ages, from $\sim$
50 Myr to $\sim$ 4 Gyr. Because it relies on our physical model of convective penetration, this scenario
has a limited number of assumptions. It can explain the observed trend between rotation and depletion,
based on a single additional assumption, namely that rotation affects the mixing efficiency at
the convective boundary. We suggest the existence of a threshold in stellar rotation rate above
which rotation strongly prevents the vertical penetration of plumes and below which rotation has
small effects. In addition to providing a possible explanation for the long standing problem of
lithium depletion in pre-main sequence and main sequence stars, the strength of our scenario is
that its basic assumptions can be tested by future hydrodynamic simulations.
