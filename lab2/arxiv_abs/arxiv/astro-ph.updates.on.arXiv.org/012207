The REX (Radio-Emitting X-ray sources) is a catalogue produced by cross-matching X-ray data from
the ROSAT-PSPC archive of pointed observations and radio data from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey, aimed
at the selection of blazars. From the REX catalogue, we select a well defined and statistically complete
sample of high-energy peaked BL Lac (HBL). HBL are expected to be the most numerous class of extragalactic
TeV emitting sources. Specifically, we have considered only the REX sources in the currently planned
CTA extragalactic survey area satisfying specific criteria and with an optical spectroscopic
confirmation. We obtain 46 HBL candidates that we called Te-REX (TeV-emitting REX). We estimate
the very high-energy gamma-ray emission, in the TeV domain, using an empirical approach i.e. using
specific statistical relations between gamma-rays (at GeV energies) and radio/X-rays properties
observed in bright HBL from the literature. We compare the spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
with the sensitivities of current and upcoming Cherenkov telescopes and we predict that 14 Te-REX
could be detectable with 50 hours of observations of CTA and 7 of them also with current Cherenkov
facilities in 50 hours. By extrapolating these numbers on the total extragalactic sky, we predict
that about 800 HBL could be visible in pointed CTA observations and about 400 with current Cherenkov
telescopes in 50 hours. Interestingly, our predictions show that a non-negligible fraction (about
30%) of the HBL that will be detectable by CTA is composed of relatively weak objects whose optical
nuclear emission is swamped by the host-galaxy light and not (yet) detected by Fermi-LAT.
