The Red Planet has fascinated humans for millennia, especially for the last few centuries, and particularly
during the Space Age. The nagging suspicion of extant Martian life is both fed by, and drives the many
space missions to Mars and recent detections of large, seasonal volumes of atmospheric methane
have re-fuelled the discussion. Methane's strongest vibrational frequency (around 3.3 micron)
occurs in the lower half of astronomers' L Band in the near infra red, and is readily detectable in
the Martian atmosphere from ground based spectroscopes at high, dry locations such as Hawaii and
Chile. However, resolution of specific spectral absorption lines that categorically identify
methane are disputed in the literature, as are their origins. With the proposed construction of
extremely large telescopes operating in the optical/NIR, the question became: could these ELTs
supplement, or even replace space-based instruments trained on Martian methane? A 2012 review
of immediate-past, present and future NIR spectrometers on Earth, in the air, in Earth orbit, in
solar orbit, in L2 orbit, in Mars orbit, and on Mars, revealed a wide range of capabilities and limitations.
Spatial, spectral, radiometric and temporal resolutions were all considered and found to be complex,
inter-related and highly instrument-specific. The Giant Magellan Telescope, the Thirty Meter
Telescope and the European Extremely Large Telescope will each have at least one L Band spectrometer
supported by state-of-the-art adaptive optics and be capable of extreme spatial, spectral and
radiometric resolution. Replicating observations over time will provide a critical constraint
to theoretical considerations about the biotic or abiotic origins of any detected methane and it
is recommended that existing datasets be mined, science cases for the ELTs include Martian methane
and collaboration between science teams be enhanced.
