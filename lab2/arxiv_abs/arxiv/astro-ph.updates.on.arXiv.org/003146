We present infrared and submillimeter observations of the Crab-like supernova remnant (SNR) G54.1+0.3
including 350 micron (SHARC-II), 870 micron (LABOCA), 70, 100, 160, 250, 350 and 500 micron (Herschel)
and ancillary mid-infrared observations from Spitzer. The distribution of the shell-like ejecta
and dust around the pulsar wind nebula in G54.1+0.3 is analogous with the Crab Nebula. In the mid-infrared
we detect dust features at 9, 11 and 21 micron and we also reveal a long wavelength continuum dust component.
The 21 micron dust feature is particularly strong in the western shell of G54.1+0.3 and coincides
with [Ar II] ejecta emission and 9 micron dust feature. The 21 micron feature is remarkably similar
to the 21 micron-dust component detected originally in Cas A. The IRAC 8 micron image including Ar
ejecta is distributed in a shell-like morphology which is coincident with dust emission, suggesting
that dust has formed in the ejecta. We fit the IR-submm spectral energy distribution of the SNR using
the continuous distributions of ellipsoidal grain model of pre-solar grain SiO2 that reproduces
the 21 and 9 micron dust features, and discuss grains of SiC and PAH that may be responsible for the
11 micron dust feature. To reproduce the long-wavelength continuum, we explore models consisting
of different grains including Mg2SiO4, MgSiO3, Al2O3, FeS, carbon and Fe3O4. We also tested a model
with a temperature-dependent silicate absorption coefficient. We detect cold dust (27-44 K) in
the remnant and the total dust mass ranges from 0.08-0.9 Msun depending on the grain composition,
which is comparable to predicted masses from theoretical models. Our estimated dust masses are
consistent with the idea that SNe are a significant source of dust in the early Universe.
