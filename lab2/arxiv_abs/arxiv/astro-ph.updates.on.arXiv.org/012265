We collected a sample of ten hitherto unidentified SPB stars with the aim of describing their pulsational
properties and identifying pulsational modes. Photometric time series data from various surveys
were collected and analyzed using diverse frequency search algorithms. We calculated astrophysical
parameters and investigated the location of our sample stars in the \logTeff\ versus \logl\ diagram.
Current pulsational models were calculated and used for the identification of pulsational modes
in our sample stars. An extensive grid of stellar models along with their g-mode eigenfrequencies
was calculated and subsequently cross-matched with the observed pulsational frequencies. The
best-fit models were then used in an attempt to constrain stellar parameters such as mass, age, metallicity,
and convective overshoot. We present detected frequencies, corresponding g-mode identifications,
and the masses and ages of the stellar models producing the best frequency cross-matches. We partially
succeeded in constraining stellar parameters, in particular concerning mass and age. Where applicable,
rotation periods have been derived from the spacing of triplet component frequencies. No evolved
SPB stars are present in our sample. We identify two candidate high-metallicity objects (HD\,86424
and HD\,163285), one young SPB star (HD\,36999), and two candidate young SPB stars (HD\,61712 and
HD\,61076). We demonstrate the feasibility of using ground-based observations to perform basic
asteroseismological analyses of SPB stars. Our results significantly enlarge the sample of known
SPB stars with reliable pulsational mode identifications, which provides important input parameters
for modeling attempts aiming to investigate the internal processes at work in upper main-sequence
stars.
