We present an investigation of potential signatures of the formation of multiple stellar populations
in recently formed extragalactic star clusters. All of the Galactic globular clusters for which
good samples of individual stellar abundances are available show evidence for multiple populations.
This appears to require that multiple episodes of star formation and light element enrichment are
the norm in the history of a globular cluster. We show that there are detectable observational signatures
of multiple formation events in the unresolved spectra of massive, young extragalactic star clusters.
We present the results of a pilot program to search for one of the cleanest signatures that we identify
- the combined presence of emission lines from a very recently formed population and absorption
lines from a somewhat older population. A possible example of such a system is identified in the Antennae
galaxies. This source's spectrum shows evidence of two stellar populations with ages of 8 Myr and
80 Myr. Further investigation shows that these populations are in fact physically separated, but
only by a projected distance of 59 pc. We show that the clusters are consistent with being bound and
discuss the possibility that their coalescence could result in a single globular cluster hosting
multiple stellar populations. While not the prototypical system proposed by most theories of the
formation of multiple populations in clusters, the detection of this system in a small sample is
both encouraging and interesting. Our investigation suggests that expanded surveys of massive
young star clusters should detect more clusters with such signatures.
