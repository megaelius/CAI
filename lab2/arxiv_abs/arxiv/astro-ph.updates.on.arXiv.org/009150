We present stellar_wind.py, a module that provides multiple methods of simulating stellar winds
using smoothed particle hydrodynamics codes (SPH) within the astrophysical multipurpose software
environment (AMUSE) framework. With the simple wind mode, we create SPH wind particles in a spherically
symmetric shell. We inject the wind particles with a velocity equal to their terminal velocity.
The accelerating wind mode is similar, but with this method particles can be injected with a lower
initial velocity than the terminal velocity and they are accelerated away from the star according
to an acceleration function. With the heating wind mode, SPH particles are created with zero initial
velocity with respect to the star, but instead wind particles are given an internal energy based
on the integrated mechanical luminosity of the star. This mode is designed to be used on longer timescales
and larger spatial scales compared to the other two modes and assumes that the star is embedded in
a gas cloud. For fast winds, we find that both the simple and accelerating mode can reproduce the desired
velocity, density and temperature profiles. For slow winds, the simple wind mode is insufficient
due to dominant hydrodynamical effects that change the wind velocities. The accelerating mode,
with additional options to account for these hydrodynamical effects, can still reproduce the desired
wind profiles. We test the heating mode by simulating both a normal wind and a supernova explosion
of a single star in a uniform density medium. The stellar wind simulation results matches the analytical
solution for an expanding wind bubble. The supernova simulation gives qualitatively correct results,
but the simulated bubble expands faster than the analytical solution predicts. We conclude with
an example of a triple star system which includes the colliding winds of all three stars.
