Of the almost 40 star forming galaxies at z>~5 (not counting QSOs) observed in [CII] to date, nearly
half are either very faint in [CII], or not detected at all, and fall well below expectations based
on locally derived relations between star formation rate (SFR) and [CII] luminosity. Combining
cosmological zoom simulations of galaxies with SIGAME (SImulator of GAlaxy Millimeter/submillimeter
Emission) we have modeled the multi-phased interstellar medium (ISM) and its emission in [CII],
[OI] and [OIII], from 30 main sequence galaxies at z~6 with star formation rates ~3-23Msun/yr, stellar
masses ~(0.7-8)x10^9Msun, and metallicities ~(0.1-0.4)xZsun. The simulations are able to reproduce
the aforementioned [CII]-faintness at z>5, match two of the three existing z>~5 detections of [OIII],
and are furthermore roughly consistent with the [OI] and [OIII] luminosity relations with SFR observed
for local starburst galaxies. We find that the [CII] emission is dominated by the diffuse ionized
gas phase and molecular clouds, which on average contribute ~66% and ~27%, respectively. The molecular
gas, which constitutes only ~10% of the total gas mass is thus a more efficient emitter of [CII] than
the ionized gas making up ~85% of the total gas mass. A principal component analysis shows that the
[CII] luminosity correlates with the star formation activity as well as average metallicity. The
low metallicities of our simulations together with their low molecular gas mass fractions can account
for their [CII]-faintness, and we suggest these factors may also be responsible for the [CII]-faint
normal galaxies observed at these early epochs.
