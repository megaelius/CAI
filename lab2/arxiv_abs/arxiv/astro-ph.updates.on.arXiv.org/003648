The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Polarization plays an important role in current cosmological
studies. CMB B-mode polarization is the most effective probe to primordial gravitational waves
(PGWs) and a test of the inflation as well as other theories of the early universe such as bouncing
and cyclic universe. So far, all ground-based CMB polarization experiments are located in the southern
hemisphere. Recently, China has launched the Ali CMB Polarization Telescopes (AliCPTs) in Tibet
Plateau as a first ground-based CMB polarization experiment in the northern hemisphere to detect
the PGWs. AliCPTs include two stages, the first one is to a telescope at the 5250m site (AliCPT-1)
and the second one is to build a more sensitive telescope at a higher altitude of about 6000m (AliCPT-2).
In this paper, we report the atmospherical condition, sky coverage and the current infrastructure
associated with AliCPTs. We analyzed the reanalysis data from MERRA-2 together with radiosonde
data of the Ali weather station and found that the amount of water vapor has a heavy seasonal variation
and October to March is the suitable observation time. We also found 95/150 GHz to be feasible for
AliCPT-1, and higher frequencies to be possible for AliCPT-2. Then we performed an analysis on observable
sky and the target field, and showed that Ali provides us a unique opportunity to observe CMB with
less foreground contamination in the northern hemisphere and is complementary to the existed southern
CMB experiments. Together with the developed infrastructure, we point out that Ali opens a new window
for CMB observation and will be one of the major sites in the world along with Antarctic and Chile.
