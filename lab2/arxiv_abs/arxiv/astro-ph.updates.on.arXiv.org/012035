We examine 172 Ang ultra-high-resolution images of a solar plage region from the Hi-C 2.1 ("Hi-C")
rocket flight of 2018 May 29. Over its five-minute flight, Hi-C resolves a plethora of small-scale
dynamic features that appear near noise level in concurrent Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA) 171 Ang images. For ten selected events, comparisons with AIA images at other
wavelengths and with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) images indicate that these
features are cool (compared to the corona) ejections. Combining Hi-C 172 Ang, AIA 171 Ang, IRIS 1400
Ang, and H$\alpha$, we see that these ten cool ejections are similar to the H$\alpha$ "dynamic fibrils"
and Ca ii "anemone jets" found in earlier studies. The front of some of our cool ejections are likely
heated, showing emission in IRIS 1400 Ang. On average, these cool ejections have approximate widths:
$3''.2 \pm 2''.1$, (projected) maximum heights and velocities: $4''.3 \pm 2''.5$ and $23 \pm 6$
km/s, and lifetimes: $6.5 \pm 2.4$ min. We consider whether these Hi-C features might result from
eruptions of sub-minifilaments (smaller than the minifilaments that erupt to produce coronal
jets). Comparisons with SDO's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetograms do not show
magnetic mixed-polarity neutral lines at these events' bases, as would be expected for true scaled-down
versions of solar filaments/minifilaments. But the features' bases are all close to single-polarity
strong-flux-edge locations, suggesting possible local opposite-polarity flux unresolved by
HMI. Or, it may be that our Hi-C ejections instead operate via the shock-wave mechanism that is suggested
to drive dynamic fibrils and the so-called type I spicules.
