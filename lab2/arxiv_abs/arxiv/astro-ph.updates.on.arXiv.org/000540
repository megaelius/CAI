Despite the fact that pulsars have been observed for almost half a century, many questions have remained
unanswered. We use the analysis of X-ray observations in order to study the polar cap region of radio
pulsars. The size of the hot spots implies that the magnetic field configuration just above the stellar
surface differs significantly from a purely dipole one. We can estimate the surface magnetic field
as of the order of $10^{14}\,{\rm G}$. On the other hand, the temperature of the hot spots is about
a few million Kelvins. Based on these two facts the Partially Screened Gap (PSG) model was proposed
to describe the Inner Acceleration Region (IAR). The PSG model assumes that the temperature of the
actual polar cap is equal to the so-called critical value, i.e. the temperature at which the outflow
of thermal ions from the surface screens the gap completely. We have found that, depending on the
conditions above the polar cap, the generation of high energetic photons in IAR can be caused either
by Curvature Radiation (CR) or by Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS). This results in two different
scenarios of breaking the acceleration gap: the so-called PSG-off mode for CR-dominated gaps and
the PSG-on mode ICS-dominated gaps. The existence of two different mechanisms of gap breakdown
naturally explains the mode-changing and the pulse nulling. Furthermore, the mode changes of the
IAR may explain the anti-correlation of radio and X-ray emission in very recent observations of
PSR B0943+10 (Hermsen et al., 2013). Simultaneous analysis of X-ray and radio properties have allowed
to develop a model which explains the drifting subpulse phenomenon. According to this model the
drift takes place when the charge density in IAR differs from the Goldreich-Julian co-rotational
density. The proposed model allows to verify both the radio drift parameters and X-ray efficiency
of the observed pulsars.
