Galaxy mergers are a major evolutionary transformation whose effects are borne out by a plethora
of observations and numerical simulations. However, most previous simulations have used idealised,
isolated, binary mergers and there has not been significant progress on studying statistical samples
of galaxy mergers in large cosmological simulations. We present a sample of 27,691 post-merger
(PM) galaxies ($0\le z \le 1$) identified from IllustrisTNG: a cosmological, large box, magneto-hydrodynamical
simulation suite. The PM sample spans a wide range of merger and galaxy properties ($M_\star$, $\mu$,
$f_\mathrm{gas}$). We demonstrate that star forming (SF) PMs exhibit enhanced star formation
rates (SFRs) on average by a factor of $\sim 2$, while the passive PMs show no statistical enhancement.
We find that the SFR enhancements: (1) show no dependence on redshift, (2) anti-correlate with the
PM's stellar mass, and (3) correlate with the gas fraction of the PM's progenitors. However, SF PMs
show stronger enhancements which may indicate other processes being at play (e.g., gas phase, feedback
efficiency). Although the SFR enhancement correlates mildly with the merger mass ratio, the more
abundant minor mergers ($0.1 \le \mu < 0.3 $) still contribute $\sim 50\%$ of the total SFR enhancement.
By tracing the PM sample forward in time, we find that galaxy mergers can drive significant SFR enhancements
which decay over $\sim 0.5$ Gyr independent of the merger mass ratio, although the decay timescale
is dependent on the simulation resolution. The strongest merger-driven starburst galaxies evolve
to be passive/quenched on faster timescales than their controls.
