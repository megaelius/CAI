Most massive stars are born in binary or higher-order multiple systems and exchange mass with a companion
during their lives. In particular, the progenitors of a large fraction of compact object mergers,
and Galactic neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs) have been stripped off their envelopes by
a binary companion. Here, we study the evolution of single and stripped binary stars up to core collapse
with the stellar evolution code MESA and their final fates with a parametric supernova (SN) model.
We find that stripped binary stars can have systematically different pre-SN structures compared
to genuine single stars and thus also different SN outcomes. The bases of these differences are already
established by the end of core helium burning and are preserved up to core collapse. We find a non-monotonic
pattern of NS and BH formation as a function of CO core mass that is different in single and stripped
binary stars. In terms of initial masses, single stars of >35 Msun all form BHs, while this transition
is only at 70 Msun in stripped stars. On average, stripped stars give rise to lower NS and BH masses,
higher explosion energies, higher kick velocities and higher nickel yields. Within a simplified
population synthesis model, we show that our results lead to a significant reduction of the rates
of BH-NS and BH-BH mergers with respect to typical assumptions made on NS and BH formation. Therefore,
we predict lower detection rates of such merger events by, e.g., advanced LIGO than is often considered.
We further show how features in the NS-BH mass distribution of single and stripped stars relate to
the chirp-mass distribution of compact object mergers. Further implications of our findings are
discussed with respect to the missing red-supergiant problem, a possible mass gap between NSs and
BHs, X-ray binaries and observationally inferred nickel masses from Type Ib/c and IIP Sne. [abridged]
