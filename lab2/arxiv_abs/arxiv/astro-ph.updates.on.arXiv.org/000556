We aim at characterising dense cores in the clustered environments associated with massive star-forming
regions. For this, we present an uniform analysis of VLA NH3(1,1) and (2,2) observations towards
a sample of 15 massive star-forming regions, where we identify a total of 73 cores, classify them
as protostellar, quiescent starless, or perturbed starless, and derive some physical properties.
The average sizes and ammonia column densities are 0.06 pc and 10^15 cm^-2, respectively, with no
significant differences between the starless and protostellar cores, while the linewidth and
rotational temperature of quiescent starless cores are smaller, 1.0 km/s and 16 K, than those of
protostellar (1.8 km/s, 21 K), and perturbed starless (1.4 km/s, 19 K) cores. Such linewidths and
temperatures for these quiescent starless cores in the surroundings of massive stars are still
significantly larger than the typical values measured in starless cores of low-mass star-forming
regions, implying an important non-thermal component. We confirm at high angular resolutions
the correlations previously found with single-dish telescopes between the linewidth, the temperature
of the cores, and the bolometric luminosity. In addition, we find a correlation between the temperature
of each core and the incident flux from the most massive star in the cluster, suggesting that the large
temperatures measured in the starless cores of our sample could be due to heating from the nearby
massive star. A simple virial equilibrium analysis seems to suggest a scenario of a self-similar,
self-graviting, turbulent, virialised hierarchy of structures from clumps (0.1-10 pc) to cores
(0.05 pc). A closer inspection of the dynamical state taking into account external pressure effects,
reveal that relatively strong magnetic field support may be needed to stabilise the cores, or that
they are unstable and thus on the verge of collapse.
