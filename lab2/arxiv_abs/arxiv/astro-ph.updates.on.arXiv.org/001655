We use the effective field theory of dark energy to explore the space of modified gravity models which
are capable of driving the present cosmic acceleration. We identify five universal functions of
cosmic time that are enough to describe a wide range of theories containing a single scalar degree
of freedom in addition to the metric. The first function (the effective equation of state) uniquely
controls the expansion history of the universe. The remaining four functions appear in the linear
cosmological perturbation equations, but only three of them regulate the growth history of large
scale structures. We propose a specific parameterization of such functions in terms of characteristic
coefficients that serve as coordinates in the space of modified gravity theories and can be effectively
constrained by the next generation of cosmological experiments. We address in full generality
the problem of the soundness of the theory against ghost-like and gradient instabilities and show
how the space of non-pathological models shrinks when a more negative equation of state parameter
is considered. This analysis allows us to locate a large class of stable theories that violate the
null energy condition (i.e. super-acceleration models) and to recover, as particular subsets,
various models considered so far. Finally, under the assumption that the true underlying cosmological
model is the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) scenario, and relying on the figure of merit
of EUCLID-like observations, we demonstrate that the theoretical requirement of stability significantly
narrows the empirical likelihood, increasing the discriminatory power of data. We also find that
the vast majority of these non-pathological theories generating the same expansion history as
the $\Lambda$CDM model predict a different, lower, growth rate of cosmic structures.
