The annihilation of Weakly Interactive Massive Particles (WIMP) in the centre of the sun could give
rise to neutrino fluxes. We study the prospects of searching for these neutrinos at the upcoming
Iron CALorimeter (ICAL) detector to be housed at the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO). We
perform ICAL simulations to obtain the detector efficiencies and resolutions in order to simulate
muon events in ICAL due to neutrinos coming from annihilation of WIMP in the mass range $m_\chi = (3-100)$
GeV. The atmospheric neutrinos pose a major background for these indirect detection studies and
can be reduced using the fact that the signal comes only from the direction of the sun. For a given WIMP
mass, we find the opening angle $\theta_{90}$ such that 90 \% of the signal events are contained within
this angle and use this cone-cut criteria to reduce the atmospheric neutrino background. The reduced
background is then weighted by the solar exposure function at INO to obtain the final background
spectrum for a given WIMP mass. We perform a $\chi^2$ analysis and present expected exclusion regions
in the $\sigma_{SD}-m_\chi$ and $\sigma_{SI}-m_\chi$, where $\sigma_{SD}$ and $\sigma_{SI}$
are the WIMP-nucleon Spin-Dependent (SD) and Spin-Independent (SI) scattering cross-section,
respectively. For a 10 years exposure and $m_\chi=25$ GeV, the expected 90 \% C.L. exclusion limit
is found to be $\sigma_{SD} < 7.82\times 10^{-41}$ cm$^2$ and $\sigma_{SI} < 8.97\times 10^{-43}$
cm$^2$ for the $\tau^{+} \tau^{-}$ annihilation channel and $\sigma_{SD} < 1.23\times 10^{-39}$
cm$^2$ and $\sigma_{SI} < 1.43\times 10^{-41}$ cm$^2$ for the $b~\bar b $ channel, assuming 100
\% branching ratio for each of the WIMP annihilation channel.
