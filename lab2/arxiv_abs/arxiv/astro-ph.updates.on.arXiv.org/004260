We provide mass-loss rate predictions for O stars from Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. We calculate
global (unified, hydrodynamic) model atmospheres of main sequence, giant, and supergiant stars
for chemical composition corresponding to Magellanic Clouds. The models solve radiative transfer
equation in comoving frame, kinetic equilibrium equations (also known as NLTE equations), and
hydrodynamical equations from (quasi-)hydrostatic atmosphere to expanding stellar wind. The
models allow us to predict wind density, velocity, and temperature (consequently also the terminal
wind velocity and the mass-loss rate) just from basic global stellar parameters. As a result of their
lower metallicity, the line radiative driving is weaker leading to lower wind mass-loss rates with
respect to the Galactic stars. We provide a formula that fits the mass-loss rate predicted by our
models as a function of stellar luminosity and metallicity. On average, the mass-loss rate scales
with metallicity as $ \dot M\sim Z^{0.59}$. The predicted mass-loss rates are lower than mass-loss
rates derived from H$\alpha$ diagnostics and can be reconciled with observational results assuming
clumping factor $C_\text{c}=9$. On the other hand, the predicted mass-loss rates either agree
or are slightly higher than the mass-loss rates derived from ultraviolet wind line profiles. The
calculated \ion{P}{v} ionization fractions also agree with values derived from observations
for LMC stars with $T_\text{eff}\leq40\,000\,$K. Taken together, our theoretical predictions
provide reasonable models with consistent mass-loss rate determination, which can be used for
quantitative study of stars from Magellanic Clouds.
