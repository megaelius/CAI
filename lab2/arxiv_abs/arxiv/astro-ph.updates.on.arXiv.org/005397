Hydrogen Balmer lines are commonly used as spectroscopic effective temperature diagnostics of
late-type stars. However, the absolute accuracy of classical methods that are based on one-dimensional
(1D) hydrostatic model atmospheres and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) is still unclear.
To investigate this, we carry out 3D non-LTE calculations for the Balmer lines, performed, for the
first time, over an extensive grid of 3D hydrodynamic STAGGER model atmospheres. For H$\alpha$,
H$\beta$, and H$\gamma$, we find significant 1D non-LTE versus 3D non-LTE differences (3D effects):
the outer wings tend to be stronger in 3D models, particularly for H$\gamma$, while the inner wings
can be weaker in 3D models, particularly for H$\alpha$. For H$\alpha$, we also find significant
3D LTE versus 3D non-LTE differences (non-LTE effects): in warmer stars ($T_{\text{eff}}\approx6500$K)
the inner wings tend to be weaker in non-LTE models, while at lower effective temperatures ($T_{\text{eff}}\approx4500$K)
the inner wings can be stronger in non-LTE models; the non-LTE effects are more severe at lower metallicities.
We test our 3D non-LTE models against observations of well-studied benchmark stars. For the Sun,
we infer concordant effective temperatures from H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and H$\gamma$; however
the value is too low by around 50K which could signal residual modelling shortcomings. For other
benchmark stars, our 3D non-LTE models generally reproduce the effective temperatures to within
$1\sigma$ uncertainties. For H$\alpha$, the absolute 3D effects and non-LTE effects can separately
reach around 100K, in terms of inferred effective temperatures. For metal-poor turn-off stars,
1D LTE models of H$\alpha$ can underestimate effective temperatures by around 150K. Our 3D non-LTE
model spectra are publicly available, and can be used for more reliable spectroscopic effective
temperature determinations.
