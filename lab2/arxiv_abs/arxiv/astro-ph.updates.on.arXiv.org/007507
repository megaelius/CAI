Gravity darkening (GD) and flattening are important consequences of stellar rotation. The precise
characterization of these effects across the HRD is crucial to a deeper understanding of stellar
structure and evolution. We seek to characterize such important effects on Sargas, an evolved,
fast-rotating, intermediate-mass star, located in a region of the HRD where they have never been
directly measured as far as we know. We use our numerical model CHARRON to analyze interferometric
(VLTI/PIONIER) and spectroscopic (VLT/UVES) observations through a MCMC model-fitting procedure.
The visibilities and closure phases from the PIONIER data are particularly sensitive to rotational
flattening and GD. Adopting the Roche approximation, we investigate two GD models: (1) the beta-model
(classical von Zeipel's law), and (2) the omega-model. Using this approach we measure several physical
parameters of Sargas, namely, equatorial radius, mass, equatorial rotation velocity, mean Teff,
inclination and position angle of the rotation axis, and beta. In particular, we show that the measured
beta leads to a surface flux distribution equivalent to the one given by the omega-model. Thanks
to our results, we also show that Sargas is most probably located in a rare and interesting region
of the H-R diagram: within the Hertzsprung gap and over the hot edge of the instability strip. These
results show once more the power of optical/IR long-baseline interferometry, combined with high-resolution
spectroscopy, to directly measure fast-rotation effects and stellar parameters, in particular
GD. As was the case for a few fast rotators previously studied by interferometry, the omega-model
provides a physically more profound description of Sargas' GD, without the need of a beta exponent.
