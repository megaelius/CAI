We demonstrate a path to hitherto unachievable differential photometric precisions from the ground,
both in the optical and near-infrared (NIR), using custom-fabricated beam-shaping diffusers
produced using specialized nanofabrication techniques. Such diffusers mold the focal plane image
of a star into a broad and stable top-hat shape, minimizing photometric errors due to non-uniform
pixel response, atmospheric seeing effects, imperfect guiding, and telescope-induced variable
aberrations seen in defocusing. This PSF reshaping significantly increases the achievable dynamic
range of our observations, increasing our observing efficiency and thus better averages over scintillation.
Diffusers work in both collimated and converging beams. We present diffuser-assisted optical
observations demonstrating $62^{+26}_{-16}$ppm precision in 30 minute bins on a nearby bright
star 16-Cygni A (V=5.95) using the ARC 3.5m telescope---within a factor of $\sim$2 of Kepler's photometric
precision on the same star. We also show a transit of WASP-85-Ab (V=11.2) and TRES-3b (V=12.4), where
the residuals bin down to $180^{+66}_{-41}$ppm in 30 minute bins for WASP-85-Ab---a factor of $\sim$4
of the precision achieved by the K2 mission on this target---and to 101ppm for TRES-3b. In the NIR,
where diffusers may provide even more significant improvements over the current state of the art,
our preliminary tests have demonstrated $137^{+64}_{-36}$ppm precision for a $K_S =10.8$ star
on the 200" Hale Telescope. These photometric precisions match or surpass the expected photometric
precisions of TESS for the same magnitude range. This technology is inexpensive, scalable, easily
adaptable, and can have an important and immediate impact on the observations of transits and secondary
eclipses of exoplanets.
