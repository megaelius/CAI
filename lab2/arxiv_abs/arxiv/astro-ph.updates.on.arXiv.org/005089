High precision proper motion (PM) measurements are available for approximately 20% of all known
dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way (MW). Here we extend the Bayesian framework of Patel et
al. (2017b) to include all MW satellites with measured 6D phase space information and apply it with
the Illustris-Dark simulation to constrain the MW's mass. Using the properties of each MW satellite
individually, we find that the scatter among mass estimates is reduced when the magnitude of specific
orbital angular momentum (j) is adopted rather than their combined instantaneous positions and
velocities. We also find that high j satellites (i.e. Leo II) constrain the upper limits for the MW's
mass and low j satellites rather than the highest speed satellites (i.e. Leo I and LMC), set the lower
mass limits. When j of all classical satellites is used to simultaneously estimate the MW's mass,
we conclude the halo mass is $0.85^{+0.23}_{-0.26}\times 10^{12} \rm \, M_{\odot}$ (including
Sagittarius dSph) and $0.96^{+0.29}_{-0.28} \times 10^{12} \rm \, M_{\odot}$ (excluding Sagittarius
dSph), cautioning that low j satellites on decaying orbits like Sagittarius dSph may bias the distribution.
These estimates markedly reduce the current factor of two spread in the mass range of the MW. We also
find a well-defined relationship between host halo mass and satellite j distribution, which yields
the prediction that upcoming PMs for ultra-faint dwarfs should reveal j within $ 5\times10^3 - 10^4$
kpc km s$^{-1}$. This is a promising method to significantly constrain the cosmologically expected
mass range for the MW and eventually M31 as more satellite PMs become available.
