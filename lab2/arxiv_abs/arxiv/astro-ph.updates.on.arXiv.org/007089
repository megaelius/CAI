There is growing observational and theoretical evidence suggesting that atmospheric escape is
a key driver of planetary evolution. Commonly, planetary evolution models employ simple analytic
formulae (e.g., energy limited escape) that are often inaccurate, and more detailed physical models
of atmospheric loss usually only give snapshots of an atmosphere's structure and are difficult
to use for evolutionary studies. To overcome this problem, we upgrade and employ an already existing
upper atmosphere hydrodynamic code to produce a large grid of about 7000 models covering planets
with masses 1 - 39 Earth mass with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and orbiting late-type stars.
The modeled planets have equilibrium temperatures ranging between 300 and 2000 K. For each considered
stellar mass, we account for three different values of the high-energy stellar flux (i.e., low,
moderate, and high activity). For each computed model, we derive the atmospheric temperature,
number density, bulk velocity, X-ray and EUV (XUV) volume heating rates, and abundance of the considered
species as a function of distance from the planetary center. From these quantities, we estimate
the positions of the maximum dissociation and ionisation, the mass-loss rate, and the effective
radius of the XUV absorption. We show that our results are in good agreement with previously published
studies employing similar codes. We further present an interpolation routine capable to extract
the modelling output parameters for any planet lying within the grid boundaries. We use the grid
to identify the connection between the system parameters and the resulting atmospheric properties.
We finally apply the grid and the interpolation routine to estimate atmospheric evolutionary tracks
for the close-in, high-density planets CoRoT-7 b and HD219134 b,c...
