The magnetic line ratio (MLR) method has been extensively used in the measurement of photospheric
magnetic field strength. It was devised for the neutral iron line pair at 5247.1 A and 5250.2 A (5250
A pair). Other line pairs as well-suited as this pair been have not been reported in the literature.
The aim of the present work is to identify new line pairs useful for the MLR technique and to test their
reliability. We use a three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation representing the
quiet Sun atmosphere to synthesize the Stokes profiles. Then, we apply the MLR technique to the Stokes
V profiles to recover the fields in the MHD cube both, at original resolution and after degrading
with a point spread function. In both these cases, we aim to empirically represent the field strengths
returned by the MLR method in terms of the field strengths in the MHD cube. We have identified two new
line pairs that are very well adapted to be used for MLR measurements. The first pair is in the visible,
Fe I 6820 A - 6842 A (whose intensity profiles have earlier been used to measure stellar magnetic fields),
and the other is in the infrared (IR), Fe I 15534 A - 15542 A. The lines in these pairs reproduce the magnetic
fields in the MHD cube rather well, partially better than the original 5250 A pair. The newly identified
line pairs complement the old pairs. The lines in the new IR pair, due to their higher Zeeman sensitivity,
are ideal for the measurement of weak fields. The new visible pair works best above 300 G. The new IR
pair, due to its large Stokes V signal samples more fields in the MHD cube than the old IR pair at $1.56\,\mu$m,
even in the presence of noise, and hence likely also on the real Sun. Owing to their low formation heights
(100-200 km above tau_5000=1), both the new line pairs are well suited for probing magnetic fields
in the lower photosphere.
