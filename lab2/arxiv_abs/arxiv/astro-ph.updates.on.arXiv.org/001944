The atmospheric composition of low-mass exoplanets is the object of intense observational and
theoretical investigations. GJ3470b is a warm uranus recently detected in transit across a bright
late-type star. The transit of this planet has already been observed in several band passes from
the ground and space, allowing observers to draw an intriguing yet incomplete transmission spectrum
of the planet atmospheric limb. In particular, published data in the visible suggest the existence
of a Rayleigh scattering slope, making GJ3470b a unique case among the known neptunes, while data
obtained beyond 2 um are consistent with a flat infrared spectrum. The unexplored near-infrared
spectral region between 1 and 2 um, is thus key to undertanding the atmospheric nature of GJ3470b.
Here, we report on the first space-borne spectrum of GJ3470, obtained during one transit of the planet
with WFC3 on board HST, operated in stare mode. The spectrum covers the 1.1--1.7-um region with a
resolution of about 300. We retrieve the transmission spectrum of GJ3470b with a chromatic planet-to-star
radius ratio precision of 0.15% (about one scale height) per 40-nm bins. At this precision, the spectrum
appears featureless, in good agreement with ground-based and Spitzer infrared data at longer wavelengths,
pointing to a flat transmission spectrum from 1 to 5 um. We present new simulations of transmission
spectra for GJ3470b, which allow us to show that the HST/WFC3 observations rule out cloudless hydrogen-rich
atmospheres (>10 sigma) as well as hydrogen-rich atmospheres with tholin haze (>5 sigma).
Adding our near-infrared measurements to the full set of previously published data from 0.3 to 5
um, we find that a cloudy, hydrogen-rich atmosphere can explain the full transmission spectrum
if, at the terminator, the clouds are located at low pressures (<1 mbar) or the water mixing ratio
is extremely low (<1 ppm).
