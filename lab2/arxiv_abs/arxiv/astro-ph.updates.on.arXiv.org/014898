We investigate the molecular gas properties of galaxies across the main sequence of star-forming
(SF) galaxies in the local Universe using $^{12}$CO($J=1-0$) (hereafter $^{12}$CO) and $^{13}$CO($J=1-0$)
($^{13}$CO) mapping data of 147 nearby galaxies obtained in the COMING project, a legacy project
of the Nobeyama Radio Observatory. In order to improve signal-to-noise ratios of both lines, we
stack all the pixels where $^{12}$CO emission is detected after aligning the line center expected
from the first-moment map of $^{12}$CO. As a result, $^{13}$CO emission is successfully detected
in 80 galaxies with a signal-to-noise ratio larger than three. The error-weighted mean of integrated-intensity
ratio of $^{12}$CO to $^{13}$CO lines ($R_{1213}$) of the 80 galaxies is $10.9$ with a standard deviation
of $7.0$. We find that (1) $R_{1213}$ positively correlates to specific star-formation rate (sSFR)
with a correlation coefficient of $0.46$, and (2) both flux ratio of IRAS 60~$\mu$m to 100~$\mu$m
($f_{60}/f_{100}$) and inclination-corrected linewidth of $^{12}$CO stacked spectra ($\sigma_{{\rm
^{12}CO},i}$) also correlate with sSFR for galaxies with the $R_{1213}$ measurement. Our results
support the scenario where $R_{1213}$ variation is mainly caused by the changes in molecular-gas
properties such as temperature and turbulence. The consequent variation of CO-to-H$_2$ conversion
factor across the SF main sequence is not large enough to completely extinguish the known correlations
between sSFR and $M_{\rm mol}/M_{\rm star}$ ($\mu_{\rm mol}$) or star-formation efficiency (SFE)
reported in previous studies, while this variation would strengthen (weaken) the sSFR-SFE (sSFR-$\mu_{\rm
mol}$) correlation.
