There is no consensus on the emission mechanism of $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs). A synchrotron model
can produce $\gamma$-ray spectra with the empirical Band function form, from a piece-wise two-power-law
electron energy distribution (2EPLS). This model predicts that for the same $\gamma$-ray spectrum,
optical emission can be very different in $f_{\nu}$ log slope, and in flux relative to $\gamma$-rays,depending
on model parameter values. The model only allows a small set of $f_{\nu}$ log slopes in the optical
-thereby allowing a clear path to verification or falsification. Measurements of prompt GRB emission
in the optical thus far give no useful information about the spectral shape within the band, and therefore
cannot be used to evaluate such predictions. We describe an experiment that responds to GRB alerts
with a fast-slewing telescope, with 3+ simultaneous, high-time resolution cameras. Three channels
measure two slopes in order to evaluate the model. We propose cross-correlation of $\gamma$ and
OIR light curves to verify that GRB are single-component dominated, or to quantify additional contributions.
Previous CCD measurements have limited-time resolution due to read noise. Electron-multiplied
CCDS (EMCCDs) can be used to greatly reduce read noise allowing exposure times of a few hundred ms.
Our Nazarbayev University Transient Telescope at Assy-Turgen Astrophysical Observatory (NUTTelA-TAO)
utilizes a 70 cm telescope that can point in $\le$ 8 s, with 3 optical channels. The NUTTelA-TAO is
expected to measure 3-8 GRB/yr, and verify/refute the 2EPLS model with just a few bright GRBs. A space-based
experiment with an IR channel would make improved measurements of the self-absorption frequency
and physical conditions within the GRB jet. Additional science includes detection of dust evaporation
due to GRBs, a tool to study progenitor environment dust.
