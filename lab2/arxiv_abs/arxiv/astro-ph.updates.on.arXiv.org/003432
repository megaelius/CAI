We present a multi-wavelength data analysis of IRAS 05463+2652 (hereafter I05463+2652) to study
star formation mechanisms. A shell-like structure around I05463+2652 is evident in the Herschel
column density map, which is not associated with any ionized emission. Based on the Herschel sub-millimeter
images, several parsec-scale filaments (including two elongated filaments, "s-fl" and "nw-fl"
having lengths of ~6.4 pc and ~8.8 pc, respectively) are investigated in I05463+2652 site. Herschel
temperature map depicts all these features in a temperature range of ~11-13 K. 39 clumps are identified
and have masses between ~70-945 M$_\odot$. A majority of clumps (having M_clump >= 300 M$_\odot$)
are distributed toward the shell-like structure. 175 young stellar objects (YSOs) are selected
using the photometric 1-5 microns data and a majority of these YSOs are distributed toward the four
areas of high column density >= 5 x 10^{21} cm^{-2}; A_V ~5.3 mag) in the shell-like structure, where
massive clumps and a spatial association with filament(s) are also observed. The knowledge of observed
masses per unit length of elongated filaments and critical mass length reveals that they are supercritical.
The filament "nw-fl" is fragmented into five clumps (having M_clump ~100-545 M$_\odot$) and contains
noticeable YSOs, while the other filament "s-fl" is fragmented into two clumps (having M_clump
~170-215 M$_\odot$) without YSOs. Together, these observational results favor the role of filaments
in star formation process in I05480+2545. This study also reveals the filament "s-fl", containing
two starless clumps, at an early stage of fragmentation.
