The implementation of ACACIA (\textbf{a}nother \textbf{c}atchy \textbf{a}cronym for \textbf{c}lump-based
mergertree \textbf{i}dentification in r\textbf{a}mses), an algorithm to generate dark matter
halo merger trees on the fly, into the AMR code RAMSES is presented. The algorithm is fully parallel
using MPI, works on the fly, and tracks dark matter substructures individually through particle
IDs. Once a clump merges into another, it is still being tracked through the last identified most
tightly bound particle of that clump, allowing to check at later snapshots whether the identified
merging event truly was one, or whether a misidentification by the density field gradient based
clump finding algorithm might have occurred, as well as to track orphan galaxies. The influence
on the merger trees of various definitions of substructure and the maximal number of particles tracked
per clump have been tested. Furthermore, with the known formation history of dark matter structure,
galaxies can be introduced in a simulation containing only dark matter particles in a forward modelling
approach through use of a parametrised stellar-mass-to-halo-mass (SMHM) relation. The obtained
predicted stellar mass functions of central galaxies from $z\sim 0 - 8$ and correlation functions
at $z\sim0$ are compared to observations. Considering that the mock galaxy catalogues were obtained
using simulations without particularly high resolutions ($512^3$ particles), the results show
satisfactory agreement with observational data. We have however demonstrated that our new merger
tree algorithm and the generation of the corresponding mock galaxy catalogue can be performed on
the fly, using the RAMSES built-in clump finder.
