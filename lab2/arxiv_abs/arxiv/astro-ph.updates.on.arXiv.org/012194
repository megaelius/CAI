The low mass star ASASSN-13db experienced an EXor outburst in 2013, which identified it as a Young
Stellar Object (YSO). Then, from 2014 to 2017 it had another outburst, longer and more luminous than
the earlier. We analyze the observations of the second outburst, and compare it to eruptions of Intermediate
Luminosity Optical Transients (ILOTs). We show that the decline of the light curve is almost identical
to that of the V838 Mon, a prototype of a type of ILOT known as Luminous Red Nova (LRN). This similarity
becomes conspicuous when oscillations that are associated with rotation are filtered out from
the light curve of ASASSN-13db. We suggest that the eruption was the result of accretion of a proto-planet
of a few Earth masses. The proto-planet was shredded by tidal forces before it was accreted onto the
YSO, releasing gravitational energy that powered the outburst for $\approx 800$ days, and ended
in a $\approx 55$ days decline phase. When the accretion material started depleting the accretion
rate lowered and the eruption light curve declined for almost two months. Then it exhausted completely,
creating a sharp break in the light curve. Another possibility is that the mass was a result of an instability
in the proto-planetary disk that lead to a large episode of accretion from an inner viscous disk.
We find that the variation of the temperature of the outburst is consistent with the surface temperature
expected from a depleted viscous accretion disk. The 2014-2017 outburst of ASASSN-13db may be the
least energetic ILOT to have been discovered to date, with an energy budget of only $\approx 10^{42}$
erg.
