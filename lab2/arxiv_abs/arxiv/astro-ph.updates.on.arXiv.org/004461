Recent studies proposed that cosmic rays (CR) are a key ingredient in setting the conditions for
star formation, thanks to their ability to alter the thermal and chemical state of dense gas in the
UV-shielded cores of molecular clouds. In this paper, we explore their role as regulators of the
stellar initial mass function (IMF) variations, using the semi-analytic model for GAlaxy Evolution
and Assembly (GAEA). The new model confirms our previous results obtained using the integrated
galaxy-wide IMF (IGIMF) theory: both variable IMF models reproduce the observed increase of $\alpha$-enhancement
as a function of stellar mass and the measured $z=0$ excess of dynamical mass-to-light ratios with
respect to photometric estimates assuming a universal IMF. We focus here on the mismatch between
the photometrically-derived ($M^{\rm app}_{\star}$) and intrinsic ($M_{\star}$) stellar masses,
by analysing in detail the evolution of model galaxies with different values of $M_{\star}/M^{\rm
app}_{\star}$. We find that galaxies with small deviations (i.e. formally consistent with a universal
IMF hypothesis) are characterized by more extended star formation histories and live in less massive
haloes with respect to the bulk of the galaxy population. While the IGIMF theory does not change significantly
the mean evolution of model galaxies with respect to the reference model, a CR-regulated IMF implies
shorter star formation histories and higher peaks of star formation for objects more massive than
$10^{10.5} M_\odot$. However, we also show that it is difficult to unveil this behaviour from observations,
as the key physical quantities are typically derived assuming a universal IMF.
