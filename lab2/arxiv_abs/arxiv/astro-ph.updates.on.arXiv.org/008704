We present the first joint inference of standard sirens and gravitational wave weak lensing by filtering
of the same dataset. We imagine a post-LISA scenario emerging around the late 2030s when LISA will
have accumulated a number of detections at high redshift; LIGO-VIRGO will have finished observing
at low redshift, and Einstein Telescope will have started making new observations out to redshifts
possibly overlapping with LISA. Euclid and other cosmological probes will have provided constraints
at percent level by then, but mostly exhausted their ability to improve any further. We derive forecasts
assuming $\sim1\,\text{deg}^{-2}$ detected sources, in conjunction with a spectroscopic follow-up
(e.g. by Euclid, DESI, or ATHENA). Thanks to the statistical power of standard sirens as a geometry
probe -- lifting key degeneracies in the gravitational wave weak lensing -- and no external priors
assumed, the constraints on dark matter and its clustering, namely $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$,
could be achieved to $2\%$ and $3\%$. The Hubble constant could be constrained to better than $1\%$
in all cases; the dark energy density, $\Omega_\Lambda$, to $2\%$, and curvature, $\Omega_K$,
to $0.02$; the amplitude and spectral tilt of the scalar fluctuations, $\ln(10^{10}A_s)$ and $n_s$,
to $2\%$ and $7\%$. As a completely independent cosmological probe, with less calibration requirements,
the joint inference of standard sirens and gravitational wave weak lensing might help solve the
tensions currently observed between other cosmological probes, such as CMB, galaxy lensing, and
Type Ia SNs, and distinguish between residual systematics and new physics.
