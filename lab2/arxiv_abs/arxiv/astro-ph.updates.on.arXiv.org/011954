With an estimated diameter in the 320 to 350 km range, (704) Interamnia is the fifth largest main belt
asteroid and one of the few bodies that fills the gap in size between the four largest bodies with $D$
> 400 km (Ceres, Vesta, Pallas and Hygiea) and the numerous smaller bodies with $D$ $\lesssim$ 200
km. However, despite its large size, little is known about the shape and spin state of Interamnia
and, therefore, about its bulk composition and past collisional evolution. We aimed to test at what
size and mass the shape of a small body departs from a nearly ellipsoidal equilibrium shape (as observed
in the case of the four largest asteroids) to an irregular shape as routinely observed in the case
of smaller ($D$ $\lesssim$ 200 km) bodies. We observed Interamnia as part of our ESO VLT/SPHERE large
program (ID: 199.C-0074) at thirteen different epochs. In addition, several new optical lightcurves
were recorded. These data, along with stellar occultation data from the literature, were fed to
the All-Data Asteroid Modeling (ADAM) algorithm to reconstruct the 3D-shape model of Interamnia
and to determine its spin state. Interamnia's volume-equivalent diameter of 332 $\pm$ 6 km implies
a bulk density of $\rho$=1.98 $\pm$ 0.68 gcm$^{-3}$ , which suggests that Interamnia - like Ceres
and Hygiea - contains a high fraction of water ice, consistent with the paucity of apparent craters.
Our observations reveal a shape that can be well approximated by an ellipsoid, and that is compatible
with a fluid hydrostatic equilibrium at the 2 $\sigma$ level. The rather regular shape of Interamnia
implies that the size and mass limit, under which the shapes of minor bodies with a high amount of water
ice in the subsurface become irregular, has to be searched among smaller ($D$ $\lesssim$ 300km)
less massive ($m$ $\lesssim$ 3x10$^{19}$ kg) bodies.
