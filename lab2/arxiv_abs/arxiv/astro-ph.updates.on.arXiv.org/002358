Radiative equilibrium temperatures are calculated for the troposphere of a tidally locked Super-Earth
based on a simple greenhouse model, using Solar System data as a guideline. These temperatures provide
in combination with a Newtonian relaxation scheme thermal forcing for a 3D atmosphere model using
the dynamical core of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology global circulation model (MITgcm).
Our model is of the same conceptional simplicity than the model of Held & Suarez (1994) and is
thus computationally fast. Furthermore, because of the coherent, general derivation of radiative
equilibrium temperatures, our model is easily adaptable for different planets and atmospheric
scenarios. As a case study relevant for Super-Earths, we investigate a Gl581g-like planet with
Earth-like atmosphere and irradiation and present results for two representative rotation periods
of $P_{rot}$ = 10 days and $P_{rot}$ = 36.5 days. Our results provide proof of concept and highlight
interesting dynamical features for the rotating regime 3 < $P_{rot}$ < 100 days, which was
shown by Edson et al. (2011) to be an intermediate regime between equatorial superrotation and divergence.
We confirm that the $P_{rot}$ = 10 days case is more dominated by equatorial superrotation dynamics
than the $P_{rot}$ = 36.5 days case, which shows diminishing influence of standing Rossby- Kelvin
waves and increasing influence of divergence at the top of the atmosphere. We argue that this dynamical
regime change relates to the increase in Rossby deformation radius, in agreement with previous
studies. However, we also pay attention to other features that are not or only in partial agreement
with other studies, like, e.g., the number of circulation cells and their strength, the role and
extent of thermal inversion layers, and the details of heat transport
