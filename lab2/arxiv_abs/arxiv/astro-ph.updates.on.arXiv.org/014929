As the number of known exoplanets has climbed into the thousands, efforts by theorists to understand
the diversity of climates that may exist on terrestrial planets in the habitable zone have also accelerated.
These efforts have ranged from analytical, to simple 0-D, 1-D, and 2-D models, to highly-sophisticated
3D global climate models (GCMs) adapted from Earth climate and weather models. The advantage of
the latter is that fewer physical processes are reduced to simple parameterizations and empirical
fits, and may instead be represented by physically-motivated algorithms. However, many such models
are difficult to use, and take a long time to reach a converged state relative to simpler models, thereby
limiting the amount of parameter space that can be explored. We use PlaSim, a 3D climate model of intermediate
complexity, to bridge this gap, allowing us to produce hundreds to thousands of model outputs that
have reached energy balance equilibrium at the surface and top of the atmosphere. We are making our
model outputs available to the community in a permanent Dataverse repository (https://dataverse.scholarsportal.info/dataverse/kmenou).
A subset of our model outputs can be used directly with external spectral postprocessing tools,
and we have used them with petitRADTRANS and SBDART in order to create synthetic observables representative
of fully-3D climates. Another natural use of this repository will be to use more-sophisticated
GCMs to cross-check and verify PlaSim's results, and to explore in more detail those regions of the
exoplanet parameter space identified in our PlaSim results as being of particular interest. We
will continue to add models to this repository in the future, including more than 1000 models in the
short- to medium-term future, expanding the diversity of climates represented therein.
