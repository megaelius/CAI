We have identified a low surface brightness stellar stream from visual inspection of SDSS imaging
for the edge-on, spiral galaxy NGC5387. A blue overdensity was also identified in SDSS coincident
with the stream intersection with the NGC5387 disk. The overdensity was also detected in the GALEX
Deep Imaging Survey and found to contribute 38% of the total FUV integrated flux from NGC5387, which
suggests that the region is actively forming stars. Deeper imaging was acquired with the Vatican
Advanced Technology Telescope (VATT) in the B, V, and R filters that confirmed the presence of both
the stellar stream and the blue overdensity. Analysis of the VATT photometry indicates the stellar
stream is red in color, B-V = 0.7, and has a stellar mass of 6x10^8 M$_{\odot}$, which implies a merger
ratio of 1:50. Assessment of the stream morphology suggests that the merger event has a circular
radius, R~16 kpc, the stream formed in ~400 Myr, and the progenitor had a total mass of ~2x10 M$_{\odot}$.
Spectroscopy from LBT+MODS1 was used to determine that the blue overdensity is at the same redshift
as NGC5387, consists of young stellar populations (~10 Myr), is metal-poor (12 + log(O/H) = 8.03),
and forming stars at an enhanced rate (~1-3 M$_{\odot}$/year) given its total stellar mass (2x10^7
M$_{\odot}$). Several interpretations are posited to explain these observational data, of which
the most likely are (i) that the blue overdensity is a region of enhanced star formation in the outer
disk of NGC5387 induced by the minor accretion event, and (ii) that the blue overdensity is the progenitor
of the stellar stream undergoing a period of enhanced star formation as a result of its interaction
with NGC5387. Confirmation and theoretical exploration of these scenarios are presented in a companion
paper.
