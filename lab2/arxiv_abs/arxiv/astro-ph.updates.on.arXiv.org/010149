$Context$. The assembly history experienced by the Milky Way is currently being unveiled thanks
to the data provided the $Gaia$ mission. It is likely that the globular cluster system of our Galaxy
has followed a similarly intricate formation path. $Aims$. To unravel this formation path, we explore
the link between the globular clusters and the hitherto known merging events that the Milky Way has
experienced. $Methods$. To this end, we have combined the kinematic information provided by $Gaia$
for almost all Galactic clusters, with the largest sample of cluster ages available after carefully
correcting for systematics. To identify clusters with a common origin we analysed their dynamical
properties, particularly in the space of integrals of motion. $Results$. We have found that about
40% of the clusters likely formed in-situ. A similarly large fraction, 35%, can be associated to
the merger events, in particular to $Gaia$-Enceladus (19%), the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (5%),
the progenitor of the Helmi streams (6%) and to the Sequoia galaxy (5%), although some uncertainty
remains due to some degree of overlap in their dynamical characteristics. Of the remaining clusters,
16% are tentatively associated to a group with high-binding energy, while the rest are all on loosely
bound orbits and likely have a more heterogeneous origin. The resulting age-metallicity relations
are remarkably tight and differ in their detailed properties depending on the progenitor, providing
further confidence on the associations made. $Conclusions$. We provide a table listing the associations
found which highlights the progress made in sorting out the assembly history of the Galactic globular
clusters. Improved kinematic data by future $Gaia$ data releases and especially a larger, systematic-free
sample of cluster ages would help to further pin down this history.
