Aims. We present low-frequency radio imaging and spectral properties of a well defined sample of
Seyfert galaxies using GMRT 240/610 MHz dual frequency observations. Radio spectra of Seyfert
galaxies over 240 MHz to 5.0 GHz are investigated using 240 MHz, 610 MHz flux densities derived from
GMRT, and 1.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz flux densities mainly from published VLA data. We test the predictions
of Seyfert unification scheme by comparing the radio properties of Seyfert type 1s and type 2s. Methods.
We choose a sample such that the two Seyfert subtypes have matched distributions in parameters that
are independent to the orientation of AGN, obscuring torus and the host galaxy. Our sample selection
criteria allow us to assume that the two Seyfert subtypes are intrinsically similar within the framework
of the unification scheme. Results. The new observations at 240/610 MHz, together with archival
observations at 1.4 GHz, 5.0 GHz show that type 1s and type 2s have statistically similar radio luminosity
distributions at 240 MHz, 610 MHz, 1.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz. The spectral indices at selected frequency
intervals as well as index measured over 240 MHz to 5.0 GHz for the two Seyfert subtypes have similar
distributions with median spectral index $/sim$ -0.7, consistent with the synchrotron emission
from optically thin plasma. In our snap-shot 240/610 MHz GMRT observations, most of the Seyfert
galaxies show primarily an unresolved central radio component, except a few sources in which faint
kpc-scale extended emission is apparent at 610 MHz. Our results on the statistical comparison of
the multifrequency radio properties of our sample Seyfert galaxies are in agreement with the predictions
of the Seyfert unification scheme.
