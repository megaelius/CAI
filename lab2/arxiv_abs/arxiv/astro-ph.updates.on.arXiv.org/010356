Context. Modern space telescopes are currently providing high-precision light curves for a large
fraction of the sky, such that many new variable stars are being discovered. However, some stars
have periodic variability with periods of order minutes and require high-cadence photometry to
probe the physical mechanisms responsible. A cadence of less than a minute is often required to remove
Nyquist ambiguities and confirm rapid variability which forces observers to obtain high-cadence
ground-based photometry. Aims. We aim to provide a modern software package to reduce ground-based
photometric time series data and deliver optimised (differential) light curves. To produce high-quality
light curves, which maximise the amplitude signal-to-noise ratio of short-period variability
in a Fourier spectrum, we require adaptive elliptical aperture photometry as this represents a
significant advantage compared to aperture photometry using circular apertures of fixed radii.
Methods. The methodology of our code and its advantages are demonstrated using high-cadence ground-based
photometry from the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) of a confirmed rapidly oscillating
Ap (roAp) star. Furthermore, we employ our software package to search for rapid oscillations in
three candidate roAp stars. Results. We demonstrate that our pipeline represents a significant
improvement in the quality of light curves, and we make it available to the community for use with
different instruments and observatories. We search for and demonstrate the lack of high-frequency
roAp pulsations to a limit of $\sim$1 mmag using B data in the three Ap stars HD 158596, HD 166542 and
HD 181810. Conclusions. We demonstrate the significant improvement in the extraction of short-period
variability caused by high-frequency pulsation modes, and discuss the implication of null detections
in three Ap stars.
