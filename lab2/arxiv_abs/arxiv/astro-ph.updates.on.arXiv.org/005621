From the early days in gamma-ray astronomy, locating the origin of GeV emission within the core of
an active galactic nucleus (AGN) persisted as an open question; the problem is to discern between
near- and far-site scenarios with respect to the distance from the super massive central engine.
We investigate this question under the light of a complete sample of low synchrotron peak (LSP) blazars
which is fully characterized along many decades in the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio up
to tens of GeV. We consider the high-energy emission from bright radio blazars and test for synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC) and external Compton (EC) scenarios in the framework of localizing the $\gamma$-ray
emission sites. Given that the inverse Compton (IC) process under the EC regime is driven by the abundance
of external seed photons, these photons could be mainly ultraviolet (UV) to X-rays coming from the
accretion disk region and the broad-line region (BLR), therefore close to the jet launch base; or
infrared (IR) seed photons from the dust torus and molecular cloud spine-sheath, therefore far
from jet launch base. We use enhanced SED information from recent works (including new $\gamma$-ray
detections) to refine the study of Syn to IC peak correlations, which points to a particular $\gamma$-ray
emission site. We show that SSC alone is not enough to account for the observed SEDs. Our analysis
favors an EC scenario under the Thomson scattering regime, with a dominant IR external photon field.
Therefore, the far-site (i.e., far from the jet launch) is probably the most reasonable scenario
to account for the population properties of bright LSP blazars in cases modeled with a pure leptonic
component. We calculate the photon energy density associated with the external field at the jet
comoving frame to be $\rm U'_{ext}=1.69 \times 10^{-2}$ erg/cm$^3$, finding good agreement to
other correlated works.
