Minor mergers are thought to be responsible for the size growth of quiescent field galaxies with
decreasing redshift. We test this hypothesis using the cluster environment as a laboratory. Satellite
galaxies in clusters move at high velocities, making mergers between them rare. The stellar mass-size
relation in ten clusters and in the field is measured and compared at $z~\mathtt{\sim}~1$. Our cluster
sample contains 344 spectroscopically-confirmed cluster members with Gemini/GMOS and 182 confirmed
with HST WFC3 G141 grism spectroscopy. On average, quiescent and star-forming cluster galaxies
are smaller than their field counterparts by ($0.08\pm0.04$) dex and ($0.07\pm0.01$) dex respectively.
These size offsets are consistent with the average sizes of quiescent and star-forming field galaxies
between $1.2\leqslant z\leqslant1.5$, implying the cluster environment has inhibited size growth
between this period and $z~\mathtt{\sim}~1$. The negligible differences measured between the
$z~\mathtt{\sim}~0$ field and cluster quiescent mass-size relations in other works imply that
the average size of quiescent cluster galaxies must rise with decreasing redshift. Using a toy model,
we show that the disappearance of the compact cluster galaxies might be explained if, on average,
$\mathtt{\sim}40\%$ of them merge with their brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and $\mathtt{\sim}60\%$
are tidally destroyed into the intra-cluster light (ICL) between $0\leqslant z\leqslant1$. This
is in agreement with the observed stellar mass growth of BCGs between $0\leqslant z\leqslant1$
and the observed ICL stellar mass fraction at $z~\mathtt{\sim}~0$. Our results support minor mergers
as the cause for the size growth in quiescent field galaxies, with cluster-specific processes responsible
for the similarity between the field and cluster quiescent mass-size relations at low redshift.
