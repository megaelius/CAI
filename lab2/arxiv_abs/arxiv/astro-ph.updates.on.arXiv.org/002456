We analyse multiwavelength observations of a western limb flare (C3.9) occurred in AR NOAA 111465
on 30 April 2012. The high resolution images recorded by SDO/AIA 304, 1600 \AA\ and Hinode/SOT H$\alpha$
show the activation of a mini-filament (rising speed$\sim$40 km s$^{-1}$) associated with kink
instability and the onset of a C-class flare near the southern leg of the filament. The first magnetic
reconnection occurred at one of the footpoints of the filament causing the breaking of its southern
leg. The filament shows unwinding motion of the northern leg and apex in the counterclockwise direction
and failed to erupt. A flux-rope (visible only in hot channels, i.e., AIA 131 and 94 \AA\ channels
and Hinode/SXT) structure was appeared along the neutral line during the second magnetic reconnection
taking place above the kinked filament. Formation of the RHESSI hard X-ray source (12-25 keV) above
the kinked filament and simultaneous appearance of the hot 131 \AA\ loops associated with photospheric
brightenings (AIA 1700 \AA) suggest the particle acceleration along these loops from the top of
the filament. In addition, EUV disturbances/waves observed above the filament in 171 \AA\ also
show a close association with magnetic reconnection. The flux rope rises slowly ($\sim$100 km s$^{-1}$)
producing a rather big twisted structure possibly by reconnection with the surrounding sheared
magnetic fields within $\sim$15-20 minutes, and showed an impulsive acceleration reaching a height
of about 80--100 Mm. AIA 171 and SWAP 174 \AA\ images reveal a cool compression front (or CME frontal
loop) surrounding the hot flux rope structure.
