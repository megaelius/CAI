Using the Herschel Space Observatory's Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared (HIFI), we
have performed mapping observations of the 620.701 GHz 5(32)-4(41) transition of ortho-H2O within
a roughly 1.5 x 1.5 arcmin region encompassing the Kleinmann-Low nebula in Orion, and pointed observations
of that transition toward the Orion South condensation and the W49N region of high-mass star formation.
Using the Effelsberg 100 m radio telescope, we obtained ancillary observations of the 22.23508
GHz 6(16)-5(23) water maser transition; in the case of Orion-KL, the 621 GHz and 22 GHz observations
were carried out within 10 days of each other. The 621 GHz water line emission shows clear evidence
for strong maser amplication in all three sources, exhibiting narrow (roughly 1 km/s FWHM) emission
features that are coincident (kinematically and/or spatially) with observed 22 GHz features.
Moreover, in the case of W49N - for which observations were available at three epochs spanning a two
year period - the spectra exhibited variability. The observed 621 GHz/22 GHz line ratios are consistent
with a maser pumping model in which the population inversions arise from the combined effects of
collisional excitation and spontaneous radiative decay, and the inferred physical conditions
can plausibly arise in gas heated by either dissociative or non-dissociative shocks. The collisional
excitation model also predicts that the 22 GHz population inversion will be quenched at higher densities
than that of the 621 GHz transition, providing a natural explanation for the observational fact
that 22 GHz maser emission appears to be a necessary but insufficient condition for 621 GHz maser
emission.
