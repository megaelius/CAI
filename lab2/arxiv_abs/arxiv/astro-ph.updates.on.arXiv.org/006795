The spectral evolution and spectral lag behavior of 92 bright pulses from 84 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
observed by the Fermi GBM telescope are studied. These pulses can be classified into hard-to-soft
pulses (H2S, 64/92), H2S-dominated-tracking pulses (21/92), and other tracking pulses (7/92).
We focus on the relationship between spectral evolution and spectral lags of H2S and H2S-dominated-tracking
pulses. %in hard-to-soft pulses (H2S, 64/92) and H2S-dominating-tracking (21/92) pulses. The
main trend of spectral evolution (lag behavior) is estimated with $\log E_p\propto k_E\log(t+t_0)$
(${\hat{\tau}} \propto k_{\hat{\tau}}\log E$), where $E_p$ is the peak photon energy in the radiation
spectrum, $t+t_0$ is the observer time relative to the beginning of pulse $-t_0$, and ${\hat{\tau}}$
is the spectral lag of photons with energy $E$ with respect to the energy band $8$-$25$ keV. For H2S
and H2S-dominated-tracking pulses, a weak correlation between $k_{{\hat{\tau}}}/W$ and $k_E$
is found, where $W$ is the pulse width. We also study the spectral lag behavior with peak time $t_{\rm
p_E}$ of pulses for 30 well-shaped pulses and estimate the main trend of the spectral lag behavior
with $\log t_{\rm p_E}\propto k_{t_p}\log E$. It is found that $k_{t_p}$ is correlated with $k_E$.
We perform simulations under a phenomenological model of spectral evolution, and find that these
correlations are reproduced. We then conclude that spectral lags are closely related to spectral
evolution within the pulse. The most natural explanation of these observations is that the emission
is from the electrons in the same fluid unit at an emission site moving away from the central engine,
as expected in the models invoking magnetic dissipation in a moderately-high-$\sigma$ outflow.
