The cosmic evolution of bias of different source populations with underlying dark matter density
field in post reionization era can shed light on large scale structures. Studying the angular and
spatial distribution of different compact sources using deep radio catalogue at low-frequency
is essential to understand the matter distribution of the present Universe. Here, we investigate
the relationship of luminous matter with their host dark matter haloes by measuring the angular
and spatial clustering of sources (two-point statistics), using deep radio observation of ELAIS
N1 (EN1) field with upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at 300-500 MHz. We also analyze
the 612 MHz GMRT archival data of the same field to understand the cosmic evolution of clustering
of different source populations. We classify the sources as star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active
galactic nuclei (AGN) based on their radio luminosity. We find that the spatial clustering length
and bias to the dark matter density field of SFGs are smaller than AGNs at both frequencies. This proves
that AGNs are mainly hosted by massive haloes and hence strongly clustered. However, a small decrease
in the bias for both kind of sources at higher frequency indicates that we are most likely tracing
the faint objects residing in less massive haloes at higher frequencies. Our results are in excellent
agreement with previous findings at radio and multi-frequency surveys. However, comparison with
SKADS simulation suggests that the halo mass for different populations used in the simulation is
systematically lower. This work quantifies the spatial distribution of extragalactic compact
objects in EN1 field and bridges the gap between shallow and deep surveys.
