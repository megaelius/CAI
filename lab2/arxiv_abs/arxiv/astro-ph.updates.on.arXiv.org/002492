A significant body of work on simulating the remote appearance of Earth-like exoplanets has been
done over the last decade. The research is driven by the prospect of characterizing habitable planets
beyond the Solar System in the near future. In this work, I present a method to produce the disk-integrated
signature of planets that are described in their three-dimensional complexity, i.e. with both
horizontal and vertical variations in the optical properties of their envelopes. The approach
is based on pre-conditioned backward Monte Carlo integration of the vector Radiative Transport
Equation and yields the full Stokes vector for outgoing reflected radiation. The method is demonstrated
through selected examples inspired by published work at wavelengths from the visible to the near
infrared and terrestrial prescriptions of both cloud and surface albedo maps. A clear advantage
of this approach is that its computational cost does not appear to be significantly affected by non-uniformities
in the planet optical properties. Earth's simulated appearance is strongly dependent on wavelength;
both brightness and polarisation undergo diurnal variations arising from changes in the planet
cover, but polarisation yields a better insight into variations with phase angle. There is partial
cancellation of the polarised signal from the northern and southern hemispheres so that the outgoing
polarisation vector lies preferentially either in the plane parallel or perpendicular to the planet
scattering plane, also for non-uniform cloud and albedo properties and various levels of absorption
within the atmosphere. The evaluation of circular polarisation is challenging; a number of one-photon
experiments of 1E9 or more is needed to resolve hemispherically-integrated degrees of circular
polarisation of a few times 1E-5. Last, I introduce brightness curves...
