Context. The CoRoT and Kepler missions have paved the way for synergies between exoplanetology
and asteroseismology. The use of seismic data helps providing stringent constraints on the stellar
properties which directly impact the results of planetary studies. Amongst the most interesting
planetary systems discovered by Kepler, Kepler-444 is unique by the quality of its seismic and classical
stellar constraints. Its magnitude, age and the presence of 5 small-sized planets orbiting this
target makes it an exceptional testbed for exoplanetology. Aims. We aim at providing a detailed
characterization of Kepler-444, focusing on the dependency of the results on variations of key
ingredients of the theoretical stellar models. This thorough study will serve as a basis for future
investigations of the planetary evolution of the system orbiting Kepler-444. Methods. We use local
and global minimization techniques to study the internal structure of the exoplanet-host star
Kepler-444. We combine seismic observations from the Kepler mission, Gaia DR2 data and revised
spectroscopic parameters to precisely constrain its internal structure and evolution. Results.
We provide updated robust and precise determinations of the fundamental parameters of Kepler-444
and demonstrate that this low-mass star bore a convective core during a significant portion of its
life on the main-sequence. Using seismic data, we are able to estimate the lifetime of the convective
core to approximately 8 Gyr out of the 11 Gyr of the evolution of Kepler-444. The revised stellar parameters
found by our thorough study are M = 0.754 +- 0.03M_Sun , R = 0.753 +- 0.01R_Sun , Age = 11 +- 1 Gy.
