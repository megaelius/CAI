The flux of very high-energy neutrinos produced in our Galaxy by the interaction of accelerated
cosmic rays with the interstellar medium is not yet determined. The characterization of this flux
will shed light on Galactic accelerator features, gas distribution morphology and Galactic cosmic
ray transport. The central Galactic plane can be the site of an enhanced neutrino production, thus
leading to anisotropies in the extraterrestrial neutrino signal as measured by the IceCube Collaboration.
The ANTARES neutrino telescope, located in the Mediterranean Sea, offers a favourable view on this
part of the sky, thereby allowing for a contribution to the determination of this flux. The expected
diffuse Galactic neutrino emission can be obtained linking a model of generation and propagation
of cosmic rays with the morphology of the gas distribution in the Milky Way. In this paper, the so-called
"Gamma model" introduced recently to explain the high-energy gamma ray diffuse Galactic emission,
is assumed as reference. The neutrino flux predicted by the "Gamma model" depends of the assumed
primary cosmic ray spectrum cut-off. Considering a radially-dependent diffusion coefficient,
this proposed scenario is able to account for the local cosmic ray measurements, as well as for the
Galactic gamma ray observations. Nine years of ANTARES data are used in this work to search for a possible
Galactic contribution according to this scenario. All flavour neutrino interactions are considered.
No excess of events is observed and an upper limit is set on the neutrino flux of $1.1$ ($1.2$) times
the prediction of the "Gamma model" assuming the primary cosmic ray spectrum cut-off at 5 (50) PeV.
This limit excludes the diffuse Galactic neutrino emission as the major cause of the "spectral anomaly"
between the two hemispheres measured by IceCube.
