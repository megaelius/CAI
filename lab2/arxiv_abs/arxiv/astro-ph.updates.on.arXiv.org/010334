We study the Local Group (LG) dwarf galaxy population using cosmological simulations of volumes
selected to resemble the surroundings of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) galaxies. The simulations,
from the APOSTLE project, indicate that the total mass within 3 Mpc of the pair's midpoint ($M_{\rm
3Mpc}$) typically exceeds $\sim 3$ times the sum of the virial masses of the two primaries and that
the dwarf galaxy formation efficiency per unit mass is uniform throughout the volume. This suggests
that MW and M31 satellites should make up fewer than one third of all LG dwarfs within 3 Mpc. This is
consistent with the fraction (28 per cent) of galaxies with stellar mass $M_*>10^7\,{\rm M_{\odot}})$
that are satellites. In addition, the total number of such galaxies (42) suggests, for the APOSTLE
galaxy mass-halo mass relation, a total LG mass of $M_{\rm 3Mpc}\sim 10^{13} \,{\rm M_{\odot}}$.
At lower galaxy masses, however, the satellite fraction is substantially higher (42 per cent for
$M_*>10^5\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$, or 42 out of 99). If this is due to incompleteness in the field sample,
then $\sim 50$ dwarf galaxies at least as massive as the Draco dwarf spheroidal are missing from our
current LG field dwarf inventory. The incompleteness interpretation is supported by the pronounced
flattening of the LG luminosity function below $M_*\sim 10^7\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$, and by the scarcity
of low-surface brightness LG field galaxies: whereas $\sim 40$ per cent of all $M_*>10^5\,{\rm
M_{\odot}}$ MW/M31 satellites have effective surface brightness below $\Sigma_{\rm eff}=26.5$
m$_V$/arcsec$^2$, only 1 out of all field dwarfs does. The simulations indicate that most missing
dwarfs should lie near the virial boundaries of the two LG primaries, and predict a trove of nearby
dwarfs that await discovery by upcoming wide-field imaging surveys.
