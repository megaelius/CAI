We have used asteroseismology to determine fundamental properties for 66 Kepler planet-candidate
host stars, with typical uncertainties of 3% and 7% in radius and mass, respectively. The results
include new asteroseismic solutions for four host stars with confirmed planets (Kepler-4, Kepler-14,
Kepler-23 and Kepler-25) and increase the total number of Kepler host stars with asteroseismic
solutions to 77. A comparison with stellar properties in the planet-candidate catalog by Batalha
et al. shows that radii for subgiants and giants obtained from spectroscopic follow-up are systematically
too low by up to a factor of 1.5, while the properties for unevolved stars are in good agreement. We
furthermore apply asteroseismology to confirm that a large majority of cool main-sequence hosts
are indeed dwarfs and not misclassified giants. Using the revised stellar properties, we recalculate
the radii for 107 planet candidates in our sample, and comment on candidates for which the radii change
from a previously giant-planet/brown-dwarf/stellar regime to a sub-Jupiter size, or vice versa.
A comparison of stellar densities from asteroseismology with densities derived from transit models
in Batalha et al. assuming circular orbits shows significant disagreement for more than half of
the sample due to systematics in the modeled impact parameters, or due to planet candidates which
may be in eccentric orbits. Finally, we investigate tentative correlations between host-star
masses and planet candidate radii, orbital periods, and multiplicity, but caution that these results
may be influenced by the small sample size and detection biases.
