Large scale solar eruptions significantly impact space weather and damages space-based human
infrastructures. It is necessary to predict large scale solar eruptions, which will enable us to
protect our vulnerable infrastructures of modern society. We aim to investigate the difference
between flaring and non-flaring active regions. We use photospheric vector magnetogram data from
Solar Dynamic Observatory's Helioseismic Magnetic Imager to study the time evolution of photospheric
magnetic parameters on the solar surface. We build a database of flaring and non-flaring active
region observed on the solar surface from the years 2010 to 2017. We train the machine learning algorithm
by the time evolution of these active region parameters. Finally, we estimate the performance obtained
from this machine learning algorithm. We find the strength of some magnetic parameters namely total
unsigned magnetic flux, total unsigned magnetic helicity, total unsigned vertical current and
total photospheric magnetic energy density in flaring active regions are much higher compared
to the non-flaring ones. These magnetic parameters in the flaring active region are highly evolving
and complex. We are able to obtain good forecasting capability with a relatively high value of true
skill statistic (TSS). We also find that time evolution of total unsigned magnetic helicity and
total unsigned magnetic flux have very high ability to distinguish flaring and non-flaring active
regions. It is possible to distinguish flaring active region from the non-flaring one with good
accuracy. We confirm that there is no single common parameter which can distinguish all flaring
active regions from the non flaring one. However, time evolution of top few magnetic parameters
namely total unsigned magnetic flux and total unsigned magnetic helicity have very high distinguishing
capability.
