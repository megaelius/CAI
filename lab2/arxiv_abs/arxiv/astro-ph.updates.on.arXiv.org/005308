The physical processes driving the evolution of star formation (SF) in galaxies over cosmic time
still present many open questions. Recent galaxy surveys allow now to study these processes in great
detail at intermediate redshift. In this work, we build a complete sample of star-forming galaxies
and analyze their properties, reaching systems with low stellar masses and low star formation rates
(SFRs) at intermediate-to-low redshift. We use data from the SHARDS multiband survey in the GOODS-North
field. Its depth (up to magnitude $\langle m_{3\sigma}\rangle\sim26.5$) and its spectro-photometric
resolution ($R\sim50$) provides us with an ideal dataset to search for emission line galaxies (ELGs).
We develop a new algorithm to identify low-redshift ($z$<0.36) ELGs by detecting the [OIII]5007
and $H\alpha$ emission lines simultaneously. We fit the spectral energy distribution (SED) of
the selected sample, using a model with two single stellar populations. We find 160 star-forming
galaxies with equivalent widths (EWs) as low as 12 {\AA}, with median values for the sample of $\sim$
35 {\AA} in [OIII]5007 and $\sim$ 56 {\AA} in $H\alpha$, respectively. Results from the SED fitting
show a young stellar population with low median metallicity (36% of the solar value) and extinction
($A_V \sim$ 0.37), with median galaxy stellar mass $\sim$ 10$^{8.5}$ M$_{\odot}$. Gas-phase metallicities
measured from available spectra are also low. ELGs in our sample present bluer colors in the UVJ plane
than the median color-selected star-forming galaxy in SHARDS. We suggest a new (V-J) color criterion
to separate ELGs from non-ELGs in blue galaxy samples. In addition, several galaxies present high
densities of O-type stars. Robust fits to the full SEDs can only be obtained including an old stellar
population, suggesting the young component is built up by a recent burst of SF in an otherwise old
galaxy.
