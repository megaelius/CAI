The streaming instability is a promising mechanism to drive the formation of planetesimals in protoplanetary
disks. To trigger this process, it has been argued that sedimentation of solids onto the mid-plane
needs to be efficient and therefore that a quiescent gaseous environment is required. It is often
suggested that dead-zone or disk-wind structure created by non-ideal magnetohydrodynamical
(MHD) effects meets this requirement. However, simulations have shown that the midplane of a dead
zone is not completely quiescent. In order to examine the concentration of solids in such an environment,
we use the local-shearing-box approximation to simulate a particle-gas system with an Ohmic dead
zone including mutual drag force between the gas and the solids. We systematically compare the evolution
of the system with ideal or non-ideal MHD, with or without back-reaction drag force from particles
on gas, and with varying solid abundances. Similar to previous investigations of dead zone dynamics,
we find that particles of dimensionless stopping time $\tau_s=0.1$ do not sediment appreciably
more than those in ideal magneto-rotational turbulence, resulting in a vertical scale height an
order of magnitude larger than in a laminar disk. Contrary to the expectation that this should curb
the formation of planetesimals, we nevertheless find that strong clumping of solids still occurs
in the dead zone when solid abundances are similar to the critical value for a laminar environment.
This can be explained by the weak radial diffusion of particles near the mid-plane. The results imply
that the sedimentation of particles to the mid-plane is not a necessary criterion for the formation
of planetesimals by the streaming instability.
