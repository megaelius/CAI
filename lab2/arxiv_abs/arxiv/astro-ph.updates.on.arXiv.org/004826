We present results on the structural properties of massive passive galaxies in three clusters at
$1.39<z<1.61$ from the KMOS Cluster Survey. We measure light-weighted and mass-weighted sizes
from optical and near-infrared Hubble Space Telescope imaging and spatially resolved stellar
mass maps. The rest-frame $R$-band sizes of these galaxies are a factor of $\sim2-3$ smaller than
their local counterparts. The slopes of the relation between the stellar mass and the light-weighted
size are consistent with recent studies in clusters and the field. Their mass-weighted sizes are
smaller than the rest frame $R$-band sizes, with an average mass-weighted to light-weighted size
ratio that varies between $\sim0.45$ and $0.8$ among the clusters. We find that the median light-weighted
size of the passive galaxies in the two more evolved clusters is $\sim24\%$ larger than for field
galaxies, independent of the use of circularized effective radii or semi-major axes. These two
clusters also show a smaller size ratio than the less evolved cluster, which we investigate using
color gradients to probe the underlying $M_{*}/L_{H_{160}}$ gradients. The median color gradients
are $\nabla{z-H} \sim-0.4$ mag dex$^{-1}$, twice the local value. Using stellar populations models,
these gradients are best reproduced by a combination of age and metallicity gradients. Our results
favor the minor merger scenario as the dominant process responsible for the observed galaxy properties
and the environmental differences at this redshift. The environmental differences support that
clusters experience accelerated structural evolution compared to the field, likely via an epoch
of enhanced minor merger activity during cluster assembly.
