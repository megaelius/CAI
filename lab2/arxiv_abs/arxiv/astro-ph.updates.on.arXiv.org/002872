The majority of discovered exoplanetary systems harbor a new class of planets, bodies typically
several times more massive than Earth but orbiting their host stars well inside the orbit of Mercury.
The origin of these close-in super-Earths and mini-Neptunes is a major unanswered question in planet
formation. Unlike Earth, whose atmosphere contains $<10^{-6}$ of its total mass, a large fraction
of close-in planets have significant gaseous envelopes, containing 1% to 10% or more of their total
mass. It has been proposed that these close-in planets formed in situ either by delivery of $50-100M_{\oplus}$
of rocky material to inner regions of the protoplanetary disc or in a disc enhanced relative to the
MMSN. In both cases, final assembly of the planets occurs by giant impacts (GIs). Here we test the
viability of these scenarios. We show that atmospheres accreted by isolation masses are small (typically
$10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ the core mass) and that atmospheric mass loss during GIs is significant, resulting
in typical post-GI atmospheres that are $10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ the core mass. In the most optimistic
scenario where there is no core luminosity from GIs and/or planetesimal accretion, we find post-GI
envelope accretion from a depleted gas disc can yield envelope masses several percent the core mass,
but still smaller than observed for many close-in planets. If the gravitational potential energy
resulting from the last mass doubling of the planet is released over the disc dissipation timescale
as core luminosity, then accreted envelope masses are reduced by about an order of magnitude. Finally
we show that even in the absence of Type I migration, radial drift timescales due to gas drag for many
isolation masses are shorter than typical disc lifetimes. Given these challenges, we conclude
that most observed close-in planets with large envelopes likely formed at larger separations from
their host stars.
