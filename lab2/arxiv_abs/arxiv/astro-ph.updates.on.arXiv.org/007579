We present a Bayesian method to constrain the masses and radii of neutron stars (NSs) using the information
encoded in the X-ray pulse profiles of accreting millisecond pulsars. We model the shape of the pulses
using "oblate Schwarzschild" approximation, which takes into account the deformed shape of the
star together with the special and general relativistic corrections to the photon trajectories
and angles. The spectrum of the radiation is obtained from an empirical model of Comptonization
in a hot slab in which a fraction of seed blackbody photons is scattered into a power-law component.
By using an affine-invariant Markov chain Monte Carlo ensemble sampling method, we obtain posterior
probability distributions for the different model parameters, especially for the mass and the
radius. To test the robustness of our method, we first analyzed self-generated synthetic data with
known model parameters. Similar analysis was then applied for the observations of SAX J1808.4-3658
by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). The results show that our method can reproduce the model
parameters of the synthetic data, and that accurate constraints for the radius can be obtained using
the RXTE pulse profile observations if the mass is a priori known. For a mass in the range 1.5-1.8 Msun,
the radius of the NS in SAX J1808.4-3658 is constrained between 9 and 13 km. If the mass is accurately
known, the radius can be determined with an accuracy of 5% (68% credibility). For example, for the
mass of 1.7 Msun the equatorial radius is Req = 11.9+0.5 -0.4 km. Finally, we show that further improvements
can be obtained when the X-ray polarization data from the Imaging X-ray Polarimeter Explorer will
become available.
