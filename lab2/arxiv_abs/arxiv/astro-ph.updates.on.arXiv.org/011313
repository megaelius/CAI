Observations of the molecular gas in galaxies are vital to understanding the evolution and star-forming
histories of galaxies. However, galaxies with molecular gas maps of their whole discs having sufficient
resolution to distinguish galactic structures are severely lacking. Millimeter wavelength studies
at a high angular resolution across multiple lines and transitions are particularly needed, severely
limiting our ability to infer the universal properties of molecular gas in galaxies. Hence, we conducted
a legacy project with the 45 m telescope of the Nobeyama Radio Observatory, called the CO Multi-line
Imaging of Nearby Galaxies (COMING), which simultaneously observed 147 galaxies with high far-infrared
flux in $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O $J=1-0$ lines. The total molecular gas mass was derived
using the standard CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor and found to be positively correlated with the
total stellar mass derived from the WISE $3.4 \mu$m band data. The fraction of the total molecular
gas mass to the total stellar mass in galaxies does not depend on their Hubble types nor the existence
of a galactic bar, although when galaxies in individual morphological types are investigated separately,
the fraction seems to decrease with the total stellar mass in early-type galaxies and vice versa
in late-type galaxies. No differences in the distribution of the total molecular gas mass, stellar
mass, and the total molecular gas to stellar mass ratio was observed between barred and non-barred
galaxies, which is likely the result of our sample selection criteria, in that we prioritized observing
FIR bright (and thus molecular gas-rich) galaxies.
