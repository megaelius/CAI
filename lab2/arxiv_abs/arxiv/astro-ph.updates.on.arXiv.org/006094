The radio as well as the high energy emission mechanism in pulsars is yet not understood properly.
A multi-wavelength study is likely to help in better understanding of such processes. The first
Indian space-based observatory, ASTROSAT, has five instruments aboard, which cover the electromagnetic
spectrum from infra-red (1300 $\AA$) to hard X-ray (380 KeV). Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager (CZTI),
one of the five instruments is a hard X-ray telescope functional over an energy range of 20-380 KeV.
We aim to estimate the timing offset introduced in the data acquisition pipeline of the instrument,
which will help in time alignment of high energy time series with those from two other ground-based
observatories, viz. the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and the Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT).
PSR B0531+21 is a well-studied pulsar with nearly aligned radio and hard X-ray pulse profiles. We
use simultaneous observations of this pulsar with the ASTROSAT, the ORT and the GMRT. The pulsar
was especially observed using the ORT with almost daily cadence to obtain good timing solutions.
We also supplement the ORT data with archival FERMI data for estimation of timing noise. The timing
offset of ASTROSAT instruments was estimated from fits to arrival time data at the ASTROSAT and the
radio observatories. We estimate the offset between the GMRT and the ASTROSAT-CZTI to be -4716 $\pm$
50 $\mu s$. The corresponding offset with the ORT was 29639 $\pm$ 50 $\mu s$. The offsets between the
GMRT and Fermi-LAT 5368 $\pm$ 56 $\mu s$. We also report detection of two new components in the off-pulse
region at 1390 MHz on MJD 57416 and 57772 , which are 320.04$^o$ and 259.02$^o$ away from the main pulse
of the pulsar and a new component in the bridge emission region which is 113.76$^o$ away from the main
pulse. (Abridged)
