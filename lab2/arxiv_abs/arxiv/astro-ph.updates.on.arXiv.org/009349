We present a statistical analysis of the first 300 stars observed by the Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet
Survey (GPIES). This subsample includes six detected planets and three brown dwarfs; from these
detections and our contrast curves we infer the underlying distributions of substellar companions
with respect to their mass, semi-major axis, and host stellar mass. We uncover a strong correlation
between planet occurrence rate and host star mass, with stars M $>$ 1.5 $M_\odot$ more likely to host
planets with masses between 2-13 M$_{\rm Jup}$ and semi-major axes of 3-100 au at 99.92% confidence.
We fit a double power-law model in planet mass (m) and semi-major axis (a) for planet populations
around high-mass stars (M $>$ 1.5M$_\odot$) of the form $\frac{d^2 N}{dm da} \propto m^\alpha a^\beta$,
finding $\alpha$ = -2.4 $\pm$ 0.8 and $\beta$ = -2.0 $\pm$ 0.5, and an integrated occurrence rate
of $9^{+5}_{-4}$% between 5-13 M$_{\rm Jup}$ and 10-100 au. A significantly lower occurrence rate
is obtained for brown dwarfs around all stars, with 0.8$^{+0.8}_{-0.5}$% of stars hosting a brown
dwarf companion between 13-80 M$_{\rm Jup}$ and 10-100 au. Brown dwarfs also appear to be distributed
differently in mass and semi-major axis compared to giant planets; whereas giant planets follow
a bottom-heavy mass distribution and favor smaller semi-major axes, brown dwarfs exhibit just
the opposite behaviors. Comparing to studies of short-period giant planets from the RV method,
our results are consistent with a peak in occurrence of giant planets between ~1-10 au. We discuss
how these trends, including the preference of giant planets for high-mass host stars, point to formation
of giant planets by core/pebble accretion, and formation of brown dwarfs by gravitational instability.
