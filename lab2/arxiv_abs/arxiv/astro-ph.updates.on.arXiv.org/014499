We have matched the ultraviolet (UV) sources in GUVcat_AIS (Bianchi et al.2017) with optical databases
having similar depth and wide sky coverage. GUVcat_AIS has GALEX far-UV (FUV, lambda-eff ~1528\AA
) and near-UV (NUV, lambda-eff ~2310\AA) photometry of approx 83~million sources, covering 24,788
square degrees of the sky, with typical depth of FUV=19.9, NUV=20.8~ABmag. Matches with Gaia and
SDSS databases are presented here. Gaia data release 2 (DR2), covering the entire GUVcat footprint
(Bianchi et al. 2019), detected about one third of the $GUVcat\_AIS$ sources. We found 31,925,294
Gaia~DR2 counterparts to 30,024,791 GUVcat_AIS unique sources, with photometry in $Gaia$~$G$
band, and often also in $Gaia$~$BP$ and $RP$ bands; 26,275,572 matches have a parallax measurement,
21,084,628/18,588,140/16,357,505 with parallax error less than 50%/30%/20%. The match with
SDSS data release 14 (DR14) yields 23,310,532 counterparts to 22,207,563 unique GUVcat_AIS sources,
10,167,460 of which are point-like, over a total overlap area of $\approx$11,100~square~degrees
(Bianchi et al. 2019)}. SDSS adds to the UV photometry five optical magnitudes: $u,g,r,i,z$, and
optical spectra of 860,224 matched sources. We used a match radius of 3arcsec, consistent with previous
works (e.g., Bianchi et al. 2011a), although the positions agree to $\lesssim$1.5arcsec for the
majority of [point-like] matched-sources, in order to identify possible multiple matches whose
UV flux could be unresolved in GALEX imaging. The catalogs can be trimmed to a tighter match radius
using the provided separation. The multi-band photometry is used to identify classes of astrophysical
objects that are prominent in UV, to characterise the content of the $GUVmatch$ catalogs, where
stars in different evolutionary stages, QSOs, and galaxies can be separated.
