To investigate the variability of the star formation rate (SFR) of galaxies, we define a star formation
change parameter, SFR$_{\rm 5Myr}$/SFR$_{\rm 800Myr}$ which is the ratio of the SFR averaged within
the last 5 Myr to the SFR averaged within the last 800 Myr. We show that this parameter can be determined
from a combination of H$\alpha$ emission and H$\delta$ absorption, plus the 4000 A break, with an
uncertainty of $\sim$0.07 dex for star-forming galaxies. We then apply this estimator to MaNGA
galaxies, both globally within Re and within radial annuli. We find that galaxies with higher global
SFR$_{\rm 5Myr}$/SFR$_{\rm 800Myr}$ appear to have higher SFR$_{\rm 5Myr}$/SFR$_{\rm 800Myr}$
at all galactic radii, i.e. that galaxies with a recent temporal enhancement in overall SFR have
enhanced star formation at all galactic radii. The dispersion of the SFR$_{\rm 5Myr}$/SFR$_{\rm
800Myr}$ at a given relative galactic radius and a given stellar mass decreases with the (indirectly
inferred) gas depletion time: locations with short gas depletion time appear to undergo bigger
variations in their star-formation rates on Gyr or less timescales. In Wang et al. (2019) we showed
that the dispersion in star-formation rate surface densities $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ in the galaxy
population appears to be inversely correlated with the inferred gas depletion timescale and interpreted
this in terms of the dynamical response of a gas-regulator system to changes in the gas inflow rate.
In this paper, we can now prove directly with SFR$_{\rm 5Myr}$/SFR$_{\rm 800Myr}$ that these effects
are indeed due to genuine temporal variations in the SFR of individual galaxies on timescales between
$10^7$ and $10^9$ years rather than possibly reflecting intrinsic, non-temporal, differences
between different galaxies.
