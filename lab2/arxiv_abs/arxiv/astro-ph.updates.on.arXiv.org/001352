The strength and direction of migration of embedded low mass planets depends on the disc's structure.
It has been shown that, in discs with viscous heating and radiative transport, the migration can
be directed outwards. In this paper we investigate the influence of a constant dM/dt-flux through
the disc, as well as the influence of the disc's metallicity on the disc's thermodynamics. We focus
on dM/dt discs, which have a net mass flux through them. Utilizing the resulting disc structure,
we determine the regions of outward migration in the disc. We perform numerical hydrosimulations
of dM/dt discs with viscous heating, radiative cooling and stellar irradiation in 2D in the r-z-plane.
We use the explicit/implicit hydrodynamical code FARGOCA that includes a full tensor viscosity
and stellar irradiation, as well as a two temperature solver that includes radiation transport
in the flux-limited diffusion approximation. The migration of embedded planets is studied by using
torque formulae. For a disc of gas surface density and viscosity, we find that the discs thermal structure
depends on the product Sigma_G \nu and the amount of heavy elements, while the migration of planets
additionally to the mentioned quantities, depends on the amount of viscosity itself. As a result
of this, the disc structure can not be approximated by simple power laws. During the lifetime of the
disc, the structure of the disc changes significantly in a non-linear way in the inner parts. In the
late stages of the discs evolution, outward migration is only possible if the metallicity of the
disc is high. For low metallicity, planets would migrate inwards and could potentially be lost.
The presented disc structures and migration maps have important consequences on the formation
of planets, as they can give hints on the different formation mechanisms for different types of planets
as a function of metallicity.
