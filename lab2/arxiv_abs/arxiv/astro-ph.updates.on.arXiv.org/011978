The present work studies the dynamics of axion quark nuggets introduced in \cite{zhitnitsky} and
exploited in the works \cite{zhitnitsky2}-\cite{zhitnitsky13}. The new feature considered
here is the possibility that these nuggets become ferromagnetic. This possibility was pointed
out in \cite{tatsumi}, although ferromagnetism may also take place due some anomaly terms found
in \cite{son}-\cite{son2}. The purpose of the present letter however, is not to give evidence in
favor or against these statements. Instead, it is focused in some direct consequences of this ferromagnetic
behavior, if it exists. The first is that the nugget magnetic field induces an electric field due
to the axion wall, which may induce pair production by Schwinger effect. Depending on the value of
the magnetic field, the pair production can be quite large. A critical value for such magnetic field
at the surface of the nugget is obtained, and it is argued that the value of the magnetic field of \cite{tatsumi}
is at the verge of stability and may induce large pair production. The consequences of this enhanced
pair production may be unclear. It may indicate that the the nugget evaporates, but on the other hand
it may be just an indication that the intrinsic magnetic field disappears and the nuggets evolves
to a non magnetized state such as \cite{zhitnitsky}-\cite{zhitnitsky13}. The interaction of
such magnetic and electric nugget with the troposphere of the earth is also analyzed. However, if
the magnetic field does not decay before the actual universe, then this would lead to high energy
electron flux due to its interaction with the electron gases of the Milky Way. This suggests that
these magnetized quarks may be a considerably part of dark matter, but only if their hypothetical
magnetic and electric fields are evaporated.
