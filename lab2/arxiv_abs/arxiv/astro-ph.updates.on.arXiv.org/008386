We study a population of significantly sub-solar enrichment galaxies at z=1.99, to investigate
how molecular gas, dust and star-formation relate in low-metallicity galaxies at the peak epoch
of star-formation. We target our sample with several deep ALMA and VLA datasets, and find no individual
detections of CO[4-3], CO[1-0] or dust, in stark contrast to the $>$60% detection rate expected
for solar-enrichment galaxies with these MS Halpha SFRs. We find that both low and high density molecular
gas (traced by CO[1-0] and CO[4-3] respectively) are affected by the low enrichment, showing sample
average (stacked) luminosity deficits $>$0.5-0.7 dex below expectations. This is particularly
pertinent for the use of high-J CO emission as a proxy of instantaneous star-formation rate. Our
individual galaxy data and stacked constraints point to a strong inverse dependence $\propto Z^{\gamma}$
of gas-to-dust ratios (G/D) and CO-to-H$_{2}$ conversion factors (aco) on metallicity at z$\sim$2,
with $\gamma_{\rm G/D}<$-2.2 and $\gamma_{\alpha_{\rm CO}}<$-0.8, respectively. We quantify
the importance of comparing G/D and aco vs. metallicity trends from the literature on a common, suitably
normalised metallicity scale. When accounting for systematic offsets between different metallicity
scales, our z$\sim$2 constraints on these scaling relations are consistent with the corresponding
relations for local galaxies. However, among those local relations, we favour those with a steep/double
power-law dependence of G/D on metallicity. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings
for (a) gas mass measurements for sub-M$^{*}$ galaxies, and (b) efforts to identify the characteristic
galaxy mass scale contributing most to the comoving molecular gas density at z=2.
