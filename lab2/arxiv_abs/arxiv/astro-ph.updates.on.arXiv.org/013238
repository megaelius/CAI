We test if Refracted Gravity (RG) can describe the dynamics of disk galaxies without resorting to
dark matter. RG is a classical theory of gravity where the standard Poisson equation is modified
by the gravitational permittivity, $\epsilon$, a universal monotonic function of the local mass
density. We use the rotation curves and the vertical velocity dispersions of 30 galaxies in the DiskMass
Survey (DMS) to determine $\epsilon$. RG describes the kinematic profiles with mass-to-light
ratios in agreement with SPS models, and disk thicknesses in agreement with observations, once
observational biases are considered. Our results rely on setting the three free parameters of RG
for each galaxy. However, we show that the differences of these parameters from galaxy to galaxy
could be ascribed to statistical fluctuations. We adopt an approximate method to find a single set
of parameters that might properly describe the kinematics of the entire sample and suggest the universality
of $\epsilon$. We finally show that the RG models of the individual rotation curves can only partly
describe the radial acceleration relation (RAR). Evidently, the RG models underestimate the observed
accelerations by 0.1-0.3 dex at low Newtonian accelerations. Another problem is the strong correlations,
at largely more than 5$\sigma$, between the residuals of the RAR models and three radially-dependent
properties of galaxies, whereas the DMS data show considerably less significant correlations,
at more than 4$\sigma$, for only two of them. These correlations might originate the non-null intrinsic
scatter of the RG models, at odds with the observed intrinsic scatter of galaxy samples, different
from DMS, which is consistent with 0. Further studies are required to assess if these discrepancies
in the RAR originate from the DMS sample, which might not be ideal for deriving the RAR, or if they are
genuine failures of RG.
