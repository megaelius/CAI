We present three-dimensional atmospheric circulation models of GJ 1214b, a 2.7 Earth-radius,
6.5 Earth-mass super Earth detected by the MEarth survey. Here we explore the planet's circulation
as a function of atmospheric metallicity and atmospheric composition, modeling atmospheres with
a low mean-molecular weight (i.e., H2-dominated) and a high mean-molecular weight (i.e. water-
and CO2-dominated). We find that atmospheres with a low mean-molecular weight have strong day-night
temperature variations at pressures above the infrared photosphere that lead to equatorial superrotation.
For these atmospheres, the enhancement of atmospheric opacities with increasing metallicity
lead to shallower atmospheric heating, larger day-night temperature variations and hence stronger
superrotation. In comparison, atmospheres with a high mean-molecular weight have larger day-night
and equator-to-pole temperature variations than low mean-molecular weight atmospheres, but
differences in opacity structure and energy budget lead to differences in jet structure. The circulation
of a water-dominated atmosphere is dominated by equatorial superrotation, while the circulation
of a CO2-dominated atmosphere is instead dominated by high-latitude jets. By comparing emergent
flux spectra and lightcurves for 50x solar and water-dominated compositions, we show that observations
in emission can break the degeneracy in determining the atmospheric composition of GJ 1214b. The
variation in opacity with wavelength for the water-dominated atmosphere leads to large phase variations
within water bands and small phase variations outside of water bands. The 50x solar atmosphere,
however, yields small variations within water bands and large phase variations at other characteristic
wavelengths. These observations would be much less sensitive to clouds, condensates, and hazes
than transit observations.
