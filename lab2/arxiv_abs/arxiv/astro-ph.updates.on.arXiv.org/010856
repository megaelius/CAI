Disks are essential to the formation of both stars and planets, but how they form in magnetized molecular
cloud cores remains debated. This work focuses on how the disk formation is affected by turbulence
and ambipolar diffusion (AD), both separately and in combination, with an emphasis on the protostellar
mass accretion phase of star formation. We find that a relatively strong, sonic turbulence on the
core scale strongly warps but does not completely disrupt the well-known magnetically-induced
flattened pseudodisk that dominates the inner protostellar accretion flow in the laminar case,
in agreement with previous work. The turbulence enables the formation of a relatively large disk
at early times with or without ambipolar diffusion, but such a disk remains strongly magnetized
and does not persist to the end of our simulation unless a relatively strong ambipolar diffusion
is also present. The AD-enabled disks in laminar simulations tend to fragment gravitationally.
The disk fragmentation is suppressed by initial turbulence. The ambipolar diffusion facilitates
the disk formation and survival by reducing the field strength in the circumstellar region through
magnetic flux redistribution and by making the field lines there less pinched azimuthally, especially
at late times. We conclude that turbulence and ambipolar diffusion complement each other in promoting
disk formation. The disks formed in our simulations inherit a rather strong magnetic field from
its parental core, with a typical plasma-$\beta$ of order a few tens or smaller, which is 2-3 orders
of magnitude lower than the values commonly adopted in MHD simulations of protoplanetary disks.
To resolve this potential tension, longer-term simulations of disk formation and evolution with
increasingly more realistic physics are needed.
