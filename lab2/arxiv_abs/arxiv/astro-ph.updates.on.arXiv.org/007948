How, when and where the first stars formed are fundamental questions regarding the epoch of Cosmic
Dawn. A second order effect in the fluid equations was recently found to make a significant contribution:
an offset velocity between gas and dark matter, the so-called streaming velocity. Previous simulations
of a limited number of low-mass dark matter haloes suggest that this streaming velocity can delay
the formation of the first stars and decrease halo gas fractions and the halo mass function in the
low mass regime. However, a systematic exploration of its effects in a large sample of haloes has
been lacking until now. In this paper, we present results from a set of cosmological simulations
of regions of the Universe with different streaming velocities performed with the moving mesh code
AREPO. Our simulations have very high mass resolution, enabling us to accurately resolve minihaloes
as small as $10^5 \: {\rm M_{\odot}}$. We show that in the absence of streaming, the least massive
halo that contains cold gas has a mass $M_{\rm halo, min} = 5 \times 10^{5} \: {\rm M_{\odot}}$, but
that cooling only becomes efficient in a majority of haloes for halo masses greater than $M_{\rm
halo,50\%} = 1.6 \times 10^6 \: {\rm M_{\odot}}$. In regions with non-zero streaming velocities,
$M_{\rm halo, min}$ and $M_{\rm halo,50\%}$ both increase significantly, by around a factor of
a few for each one sigma increase in the value of the local streaming velocity. As a result, in regions
with streaming velocities $v_\mathrm{stream} \ge 3\,\sigma_\mathrm{rms}$, cooling of gas in
minihaloes is completely suppressed, implying that the first stars in these regions form within
atomic cooling haloes.
