Be stars are rapid rotators surrounded by a gaseous disk envelope whose origin is still under debate.
This envelope is responsible for observed emission lines and large infrared excess. To progress
in the understanding of the physical processes involved in the disk formation, we estimate the disk
parameters for a sample of Be stars and search for correlations between these parameters and stellar
properties. We performed spectro-interferometric observations of 26 Be stars in the region of
the Br$\gamma$ line to study the kinematical properties of their disks through the Doppler effect.
Observations were performed at the Paranal observatory with the VLTI/AMBER interferometer. This
instrument provides high spectral and high spatial resolutions. We modeled 18 Be stars with emission
in the Br$\gamma$ line. The disk kinematic is described by a quasi-Keplerian rotation law, with
the exception of HD28497 that presents a one-arm density-wave structure. Using a combined sample,
we derived a mean value for the velocity ratio V/Vc=0.75, and found that rotation axes are probably
randomly distributed in the sky. Disk sizes in the line component model are in the range of 2-13 stellar
radii and do not correlate with the effective temperature or spectral type. However, we found that
the maximum size of a stable disk correlates with the rotation velocity at the inner part of the disk
and the stellar mass. We found that, on average, the Be stars of our combined sample do not rotate at
their critical velocity. However, the centrifugal force and mass of the star defines an upper limit
size for a stable disk configuration. For a given rotation, high-mass Be stars tend to have more compact
disks than their low-mass counterparts. It would be interesting to follow up the evolution of the
disk size in variable stars to better understand the formation and dissipation processes of their
circumstellar disks.
