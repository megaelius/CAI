This paper presents the characterization of the in-flight beams, the beam window functions and
the associated errors for the Planck Low Frequency Instrument (LFI). Knowledge of the beam profiles
is the key to determining their imprint on the transfer function from the observed to the actual sky
anisotropy power spectrum. The main beam distortions affect the beam window function, complicating
the reconstruction of the anisotropy power spectrum at high multipoles, whereas the sidelobes
affect the low and intermediate multipoles. The in-flight assessment of the LFI main beams relied
on the measurements performed during Jupiter observations. By stacking the data from Jupiter transits,
the main beam profiles are measured down to -20 dB at 30 and 44 GHz, and down to -25 dB at 70 GHz. The main
beam solid angles are determined to better than 0.2% at each LFI frequency band. To ensure a characterization
of the main beam free from the radiometer noise, a dedicated tuning on the Planck pre-launch optical
model is performed. This approach provides an optical model whose beams fully reproduce the measurements
in the main beam region, but also allow us to describe the beams at power levels lower than can be reached
by the Jupiter measurements themselves. The agreement between the simulated beams and the scanning
beams is better than 1% at each LFI frequency band. The simulated beams are used for the computation
of the window functions for the effective beams. The error budget in the window functions was estimated
considering both main beam and sidelobe contributions, as well as taking into account the radiometer
bandshapes. The total uncertainties in the effective beam window functions are: (at ell = 600) 2%
and 1.2% at 30 and 44 GHz, respectively; and at ell = 1000, 0.7% at 70 GHz.
