Gas giants accrete their envelopes from the gas and dust of proto-planetary disks, so it is important
to determine the composition of the inner few AU, where most giant planets are expected to form. We
aim to constrain the elemental carbon and oxygen abundance in the inner disk ($R<$2.3 AU) of TW Hya
and compare with the outer disk ($R>2.3$ AU) where carbon and oxygen appear underabundant by a factor
of $\sim$50. Archival infrared observations of TW Hya are compared with a detailed thermo-chemical
model, DALI. The inner disk gas mass and elemental C and O abundances are varied to fit the infrared
CO, H$_2$ and H$_2$O line fluxes. Best fitting models have an inner disk that has a gas mass of $ 2 \times
10^{-4} M_\odot$ with C/H $\approx 3 \times 10^{-6}$ and O/H $\approx 6 \times 10^{-6}$. The elemental
oxygen and carbon abundances of the inner disk are $\sim 50$ times underabundant compared to the
ISM and are consistent with those found in the outer disk. The uniformly low volatile abundances
imply that the inner disk is not enriched by ices on drifting bodies that evaporate. This indicates
that drifting grains are stopped in a dust trap outside the water ice line. Such a dust trap would also
form a cavity as seen in high resolution sub-millimeter continuum observations. If CO is the major
carbon carrier in the ices, dust needs to be trapped efficiently outside the CO ice line of $\sim$20
AU. This would imply that the shallow sub-millimeter rings in the TW Hya disk outside of 20 AU correspond
to very efficient dust traps. The more likely scenario is that more than 98\% of the CO has been converted
into less volatile species, e.g. CO$_2$ and CH$_3$OH. A giant planet forming in the inner disk would
be accreting gas with low carbon and oxygen abundances as well as very little icy dust, potentially
leading to a planet atmosphere with strongly substellar C/H and O/H ratios.
