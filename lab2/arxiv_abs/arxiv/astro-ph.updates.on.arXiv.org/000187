We provide new constraints on the connection between galaxies in the local universe, identified
by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and dark matter halos and their constituent substructures
in the $\Lambda$CDM model using WMAP7 cosmological parameters. Predictions for the abundance
and clustering properties of dark matter halos, and the relationship between dark matter hosts
and substructures, are based on a high-resolution cosmological simulation, the Bolshoi simulation.
We associate galaxies with halos and subhalos using subhalo abundance matching, performing a comprehensive
analysis which investigates the underlying assumptions of this technique including (a) which
halo property is most closely associated with galaxy stellar masses and luminosities, (b) how much
scatter is in this relationship, and (c) how much subhalos can be stripped before their galaxies
are destroyed. The models are jointly constrained by new measurements of the projected two-point
galaxy clustering and the observed conditional stellar mass function of galaxies in groups. The
data put tight constraints on the satellite fraction of galaxies as a function of galaxy stellar
mass, on the scatter between halo and galaxy properties, and on the underlying conditional stellar
mass function. These data rule out several halo properties commonly used in abundance matching,
largely because the satellite fractions in the models disagree with those data. We show that an abundance
matching model that associates galaxies with the peak circular velocity of their halos is in good
agreement with the data, when scatter of $0.20 \pm 0.03$ dex in stellar mass at a given peak velocity
is included. This will yield important constraints for galaxy formation models, and also provides
encouraging indications that the galaxy--halo connection can be modeled with sufficient fidelity
for future precision studies of the dark Universe.
