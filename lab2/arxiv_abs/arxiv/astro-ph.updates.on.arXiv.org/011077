We present an analysis of three southern open star clusters NGC 6067, NGC 2506 and IC 4651 using wide-field
photometric and Gaia DR2 astrometric data. They are poorly studied clusters. We took advantage
of the synergy between Gaia DR2 high precision astrometric measurements and ground based wide-field
photometry to isolate cluster members and further study these clusters. We identify the cluster
members using proper motions, parallax and colour-magnitude diagrams. Mean proper motion of the
clusters in RA and DEC is estimated as -1.90 \pm 0.01 and -2.57 \pm 0.01 mas/yr for NGC 6067, -2.57 \pm
0.01 and 3.92 \pm 0.01 mas/yr for NGC 2506 and -2.41 \pm 0.01 and -5.05 \pm 0.02 mas/yr for IC 4651. Distances
are estimated as 3.01 \pm 0.87, 3.88 \pm 0.42 and 1.00 \pm 0.08 kpc for the clusters NGC 6067, NGC 2506
and IC 4651 respectively using parallaxes taken from Gaia DR2 catalogue. Galactic orbits are determined
for these clusters using Galactic potential models.We find that these clusters have circular orbits.
Cluster radii are determined as 10 arcmin for NGC 6067, 12 arcmin for NGC 2506 and 11 arcmin for IC 4651.
Ages of the clusters estimated by isochrones fitting are 66 \pm 8 Myr, 2.09 \pm 0.14 Gyr and 1.59 \pm
0.14 Gyr for NGC 6067, NGC 2506 and IC 4651 respectively. Mass function slope for the entire region
of cluster NGC 2506 is found to be comparable with the Salpeter value in the mass range 0.77 - 1.54 Solar
mass. The mass function analysis shows that the slope becomes flat when one goes from halo to core
region in all the three clusters. A comparison of dynamical age with cluster's age indicates that
NGC 2506 and IC 4651 are dynamically relaxed clusters.
