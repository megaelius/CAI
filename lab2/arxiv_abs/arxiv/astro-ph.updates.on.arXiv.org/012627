We compare a sample of five high-resolution, high S/N Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra of bright $6<z \lesssim
6.5$ QSOs aimed at spectrally resolving the last remaining transmission spikes at $z>5$ with those
obtained from mock absorption spectra from the Sherwood and Sherwood-Relics suites of hydrodynamical
simulations of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We use a profile fitting procedure for the inverted
transmitted flux, $1-F$, similar to the widely used Voigt profile fitting of the transmitted flux
$F$ at lower redshifts, to characterise the transmission spikes that probe predominately underdense
regions of the IGM. We are able to reproduce the width and height distributions of the transmission
spikes, both with optically thin simulations of the post-reionization Universe using a homogeneous
UV background and full radiative transfer simulations of a late reionization model. We find that
the width of the fitted components of the simulated transmission spikes is very sensitive to the
instantaneous temperature of the reionized IGM. The internal structures of the spikes are more
prominant in low temeperature models of the IGM. The width distribution of the observed transmission
spikes, which require high spectral resolution ($\leq $ 8 \kmps) to be resolved, is reproduced for
optically thin simulations with a temperature at mean density of $T_0= (11000 \pm 1600,10500\pm
2100,12000 \pm 2200)$ K at $z= (5.4,5.6,5.8)$. This is weakly dependent on the slope of the temperature-density
relation, which is favoured to be moderately steeper than isothermal. In the inhomogeneous, late
reionization, full radiative transfer simulations where islands of neutral hydrogen persist
to $z\sim5.3$, the width distribution of the observed transmission spikes is consistent with the
range of $T_0$ caused by spatial fluctuations in the temperature-density relation.
