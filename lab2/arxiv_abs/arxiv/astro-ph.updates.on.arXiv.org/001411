Low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are a natural workbench to study accretion disk phenomena and optimal
background sources to measure elemental abundances in the Interstellar medium (ISM). In high-resolution
XMM-Newton spectra, the LMXB SAX J1808.4-3658 showed in the past a neon column density significantly
higher than expected given its small distance, presumably due to additional absorption from a neon-rich
circumstellar medium (CSM). It is possible to detect intrinsic absorption from the CSM by evidence
of Keplerian motions or outflows. For this purpose, we use a recent, deep (100 ks long), high-resolution
Chandra/LETGS spectrum of SAX J1808.4-3658 in combination with archival data. We estimated the
column densities of the different absorbers through the study of their absorption lines. We used
both empirical and physical models involving photo- and collisional-ionization in order to determine
the nature of the absorbers. The abundances of the cold interstellar gas match the solar values as
expected given the proximity of the X-ray source. For the first time in this source, we detected neon
and oxygen blueshifted absorption lines that can be well modeled with outflowing photoionized
gas. The wind is neon rich (Ne/O>3) and may originate from processed, ionized gas near the accretion
disk or its corona. The kinematics (v=500-1000 km/s) are indeed similar to those seen in other accretion
disks. We also discovered a system of emission lines with very high Doppler velocities (v~24000
km/s) originating presumably closer to the compact object. Additional observations and UV coverage
are needed to accurately determine the wind abundances and its ionization structure.
