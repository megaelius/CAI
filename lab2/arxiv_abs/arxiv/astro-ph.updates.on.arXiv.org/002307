The spiral structure of the Milky Way is not yet well determined. The keys to understanding this structure
are to increase the number of reliable spiral tracers and to determine their distances as accurately
as possible. HII regions, giant molecular clouds (GMCs), and 6.7-GHz methanol masers are closely
related to high mass star formation, and hence they are excellent spiral tracers. We update the catalogs
of Galactic HII regions, GMCs, and 6.7-GHz methanol masers, and then outline the spiral structure
of the Milky Way. We collected data for more than 2500 known HII regions, 1300 GMCs, and 900 6.7-GHz
methanol masers. If the photometric or trigonometric distance was not yet available, we determined
the kinematic distance using a Galaxy rotation curve with the current IAU standard, $R_0$ = 8.5 kpc
and $\Theta_0$ = 220 km s$^{-1}$, and the most recent updated values of $R_0$ = 8.3 kpc and $\Theta_0$
= 239 km s$^{-1}$, after we modified the velocities of tracers with the adopted solar motions. With
the weight factors based on the excitation parameters of HII regions or the masses of GMCs, we get
the distributions of these spiral tracers. The distribution of tracers shows at least four segments
of arms in the first Galactic quadrant, and three segments in the fourth quadrant. The Perseus Arm
and the Local Arm are also delineated by many bright HII regions. The arm segments traced by massive
star forming regions and GMCs are able to match the HI arms in the outer Galaxy. We found that the models
of three-arm and four-arm logarithmic spirals are able to connect most spiral tracers. A model of
polynomial-logarithmic spirals not only delineates the tracer distribution but also matches
the observed tangential directions.
