Context. The variability of the Wolf-Rayet star EZ CMa has been documented for close to half a century,
and a clear periodicity of $\sim$3.7 days is established. However, all attempts to prove that it
is a binary have failed because the photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric variations are
not coherent over more than a few orbital cycles. Aims. In this letter we show that the lack of coherence
in the variability can be explained with a very rapid apsidal motion in a binary orbit.} Methods.
We measured the times of minima in a recently published exceptionally long photometric light curve
obtained by the Toronto {\emph{BRITE}} satellite. The apsidal motion and the system eccentricity
are determined from the length of the time intervals between these minima, which alternate in their
duration, following a pattern that is clearly associated with apsidal motion. These minima are
superposed on brightness enhancements of the emission from a shock zone, which occur at about the
times of periastron phases. Results. We determine the orbital periodicity, $P_{a}=3.63\, $d,
and the period of the apsidal motion, $U\simeq 100\, $d, which together yield an average sidereal
period of $P_{s}=3.77\,$d. The eccentricity is found to be close to 0.1. The rate of periapsis retreat
changes significantly over the period of observation and is determined to be $-16^\circ\,\mathrm{P}^{-1}_a$
at the beginning of the observing period and $-10^\circ\,\mathrm{P}^{-1}_a$ at the end. Conclusions.
We demonstrate that by introducing a fast apsidal motion, the basic photometric variability is
very well explained. The binary nature of EZ CMa is now established. This might imply that other apparently
single Wolf-Rayet stars that emit hard X-rays, similar to EZ CMa, are also binaries.
