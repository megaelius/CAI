The different spatial distributions of N-bearing and O-bearing species, as is well known towards
Orion~KL, is one of the long-lasting mysteries. We conducted a survey observation and chemical
modeling study to investigate if the different distributions of O- and N-bearing species are widely
recognized in general star-forming regions. First, we report our observational results of complex
organic molecules (COMs) with the 45~m radio telescope at the Nobeyama Radio Observatory towards
eight star-forming regions. Through our spectral survey ranging from 80 to 108~GHz, we detected
CH$_3$OH, HCOOCH$_3$, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, (CH$_3$)$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$CH$_2$CN, CH$_2$CHCN,
and NH$_2$CHO. Their molecular abundances were derived via the rotation diagram and the least squares
methods. We found that N-bearing molecules, tend to show stronger correlations with other N-bearing
molecules rather than O-bearing molecules. While G10.47+0.03 showed high fractional abundances
of N-bearing species, those in NGC6334F were not so rich, being less than 0.01 compared to CH$_3$OH.
Then, the molecular abundances towards these sources were evaluated by chemical modeling with
NAUTILUS three-phase gas-grain chemical code. Through the simulations of time evolutions for
the abundances of COMs, we suggest that observed correlations of fractional abundances between
COMs can be explained by the combination of the different temperature structures inside the hot
cores and the different evolutionary phase. Since our modeling could not fully explain the observed
excitation temperatures, it is important to investigate the efficiency of grain surface reactions
and their activation barriers, and the binding energy of COMs to further promote our understanding.
