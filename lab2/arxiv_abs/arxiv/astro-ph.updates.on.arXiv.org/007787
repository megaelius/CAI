We investigate the interstellar medium properties of the disk and outflowing gas in the central
regions of nine nearby Seyfert galaxies, characterised by prominent outflows. These objects are
part of the MAGNUM (Measuring Active Galactic Nuclei Under MUSE Microscope) survey, that aims at
probing their physical conditions, by exploiting the unprecedented sensitivity of MUSE. We study
the gas properties in the disk and in the outflow with spatially and kinematically resolved maps,
by dividing the strongest emission lines in velocity bins. We associate the core of the lines to the
disk, consistent with the stellar velocity, and the redshifted and blueshifted wings to the outflow.
We find that the outflowing gas is characterised by higher values of density and ionisation parameter
than the disk, which presents a higher dust extinction. Moreover, we distinguish high- and low-ionisation
regions across the portion of spatially resolved narrow line region traced by the outflow. The high
ionisation regions characterised by the lowest [NII]/H{\alpha} and [SII]/H{\alpha} line ratios,
generally trace the inner parts along the axis of the emitting cones, where the [SIII]/[SII] line
ratio is enhanced, while the low ionisation ones follow the cone edges and/or the regions perpendicular
to the axis of the outflows, characterized by a higher [OIII] velocity dispersion. A possible scenario
to explain these features relies on the presence of two distinct populations of line emitting clouds:
one is optically thin to the radiation and characterised by the highest excitation, while the other,
optically thick, is impinged by a harder radiation field, which generates strong low-excitation
lines. The highest values of [NII]/H{\alpha} and [SII]/H{\alpha} line ratios may be due to shocks
and/or a hard filtered radiation field from the AGN.
