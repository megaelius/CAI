We investigate the possible presence of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in dwarf galaxies and other
nearby galaxies to identify candidates for follow-up confirmation and dynamical mass measurements.
We use the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) All-Sky Release Source Catalog and examine
the infrared colours of a sample of dwarf galaxies and other nearby galaxies in order to identify
both unobscured and obscured candidate AGN by applying the infrared colour diagnostic. Stellar
masses of galaxies are obtained using a combination of three independent methods. Black hole masses
are estimated using the bolometric luminosity of the AGN candidates and computed for three cases
of the bolometric-to-Eddington luminosity ratio. We identify 303 candidate AGN, of which 276 were
subsequently found to have been independently identified as AGN via other methods. The remaining
9% require follow-up observations for confirmation. The activity is detected in galaxies with
stellar masses from ~ 10^6 to 10^9 solar masses; assuming the candidates are AGN, the black hole masses
are estimated to be ~ 10^3 - 10^6 solar masses, adopting L_bol = 0.1 L_Edd. The black hole masses probed
are several orders of magnitude smaller than previously reported for centrally located massive
black holes. We examine the stellar mass versus black hole mass relationship in this low galaxy mass
regime. We find that it is consistent with the existing relation extending linearly (in log-log
space) into the lower mass regime. These findings suggest that CMBH are present in low-mass galaxies
and in the Local Universe, and provide new impetus for follow-up dynamical studies of quiescent
black holes in local dwarf galaxies.
