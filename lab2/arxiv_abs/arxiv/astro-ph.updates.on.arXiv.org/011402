We present an analysis of the long-term optical variability for $\sim50,000$ nearby (z<0.055)
galaxies from the NASA-Sloan Atlas, $35,000$ of which are low-mass ($M_{\ast}<10^{10}~M_{\odot}$).
We use difference imaging of Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) R-band observations to construct
light curves with typical baselines of several years. We then search for subtle variations in the
nuclear light output. We determine whether detected variability is AGN-like by assessing the fit
quality to a damped random walk model. We identify 424 variability-selected AGN, including 244
with stellar masses between $10^{7}$ and $10^{10}~M_{\odot}$. 75% of low-mass galaxies with AGN-like
variability have narrow emission lines dominated by star formation. After controlling for nucleus
magnitude, the fraction of variable AGN is constant down to $M_{\ast}=10^{9}~M_{\odot}$, suggesting
no drastic decline in the BH occupation fraction down to this stellar mass regime. Combining our
NASA-Sloan Atlas sample with samples of nearby galaxies with broad H$\alpha$ emission, we find
no dependence of variability properties with black hole mass. However, we caution that the variable
AGN fraction is strongly dependent on baseline. For baselines less than two years, the variable
fraction for the full sample is 0.25%, compared to 1.0% for baselines longer than two years. Finally,
comparing Stripe 82 light curves (Baldassare et al. 2018) to PTF light curves, we find populations
of changing-look AGN: 8 galaxies that are variable in Stripe 82, but quiescent in PTF, and 15 galaxies
where the reverse is true. Our PTF work demonstrates the promise of long-term optical variability
searches in low-mass galaxies for finding AGNs missed by other selection techniques.
