The chemical composition of planets is inherited by the distribution of the various molecular species
in the protoplanetary disk at thetime of their formation. As of today, only a handful of disks has
been imaged in multiple spectral lines with high spatial resolution. As part of a small campaign
devoted to the chemical characterization of disk-outflow sources in Taurus, we report on new ALMA
Band 6 observations with 20 au resolution toward the embedded young star DG Tau B. Images of the continuum
emission reveals a dust disk with rings and, putatively, a leading spiral arm. The disk, as well as
the prominent outflow cavities, are detected in CO, H2CO, CS, and CN while they remain undetected
in SO2, HDO, and CH3OH. From the absorption of the back-side outflow, we inferred that the disk emission
is optically thick in the inner 50 au. This morphology explains why no line emission is detected from
this inner region and poses some limitations toward the calculation of the dust mass and the characterization
of the inner gaseous disk. The H2CO and CS emission from the inner 200 au is mostly from the disk and
their morphology is very similar. The CN emission significantly differs from the other two molecules
as it is observed only beyond 150 au. This ring-like morphology is consistent with previous observations
and the predictions of thermochemical disk models. Finally, we constrained the disk-integrated
column density of all molecules. In particular, we found that the CH3OH/H2CO ratio must be smaller
than 2, making the methanol non-detection still consistent with the only such a ratio available
from the literature (1.27 in TW Hya).
