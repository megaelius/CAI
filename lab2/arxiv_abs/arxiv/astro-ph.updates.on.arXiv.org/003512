Extremely high data rates expected in next-generation radio interferometers necessitate a fast
and robust way to process measurements in a big data context. Dimensionality reduction can alleviate
computational load needed to process these data, in terms of both computing speed and memory usage.
In this article, we present image reconstruction results from highly reduced radio-interferometric
data, following our previously proposed data dimensionality reduction method, $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{sing}}$,
based on studying the distribution of the singular values of the measurement operator. This method
comprises a simple weighted, subsampled discrete Fourier transform of the dirty image. Additionally,
we show that an alternative gridding-based reduction method works well for target data sizes of
the same order as the image size. We reconstruct images from well-calibrated VLA data to showcase
the robustness of our proposed method down to very low data sizes in a 'real data' setting. We show
through comparisons with the conventional reduction method of time- and frequency-averaging,
that our proposed method produces more accurate reconstructions while reducing data size much
further, and is particularly robust when data sizes are aggressively reduced to low fractions of
the image size. $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{sing}}$ can function in a block-wise fashion, and could
be used in the future to process incoming data by blocks in real-time, thus opening up the possibility
of performing 'on-line' imaging as the data are being acquired. MATLAB code for the proposed dimensionality
reduction method is available on GitHub.
