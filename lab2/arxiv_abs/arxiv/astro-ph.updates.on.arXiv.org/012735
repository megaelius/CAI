The nearby ultra-compact multiplanetary system YZ Ceti consists of at least three planets. The
orbital period of each planet is the subject of discussion in the literature due to strong aliasing
in the radial velocity data. The stellar activity of this M dwarf also hampers significantly the
derivation of the planetary parameters. With an additional 229 radial velocity measurements obtained
since the discovery publication, we reanalyze the YZ Ceti system and resolve the alias issues. We
use model comparison in the framework of Bayesian statistics and periodogram simulations based
on a method by Dawson and Fabrycky to resolve the aliases. We discuss additional signals in the RV
data, and derive the planetary parameters by simultaneously modeling the stellar activity with
a Gaussian process regression model. To constrain the planetary parameters further we apply a stability
analysis on our ensemble of Keplerian fits. We resolve the aliases: the three planets orbit the star
with periods of $2.02$ d, $3.06$ d, and $4.66$ d. We also investigate an effect of the stellar rotational
signal on the derivation of the planetary parameters, in particular the eccentricity of the innermost
planet. Using photometry we determine the stellar rotational period to be close to $68$ d. From the
absence of a transit event with TESS, we derive an upper limit of the inclination of $i_\mathrm{max}
= 87.43$ deg. YZ Ceti is a prime example of a system where strong aliasing hindered the determination
of the orbital periods of exoplanets. Additionally, stellar activity influences the derivation
of planetary parameters and modeling them correctly is important for the reliable estimation of
the orbital parameters in this specific compact system. Stability considerations then allow additional
constraints to be placed on the planetary parameters.
