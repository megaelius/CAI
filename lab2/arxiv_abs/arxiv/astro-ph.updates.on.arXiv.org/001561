Recent observations by the Fermi satellite suggest that a photosphere emission component is contributing
to the observed spectrum of many GRBs. One important question is whether the photosphere component
can interpret the typical ``Band'' function of GRBs with a typical low energy photon spectral index
$\alpha \sim -1$. We perform a detailed study of the photosphere emission spectrum by progressively
introducing several physical ingredients previously not fully incorporated, including the probability
distribution of the location of a dynamically evolving photosphere, superposition of emission
from an equal-arrival-time ``volume'' in a continuous wind, the evolution of optical depth of a
wind with finite but evolving outer boundary, as well as the effect of different top-hat wind luminosity
($L_w$) profiles. By assuming a co-moving blackbody spectrum emerging from the photosphere, we
find that for an outflow with a constant or increasing $L_w$, the low-energy spectrum below the peak
energy ($E_{p}$), can be modified to $F_\nu \sim \nu^{1.5}$ ($\alpha \sim +0.5$). A softer ($-1<\alpha<+0.5$)
or flat ($\alpha=-1$) spectrum can be obtained during the $L_w$ decreasing phase or high-latitude-emission-dominated
phase. We also study the evolution of $E_{p}$ as a function of wind and photosphere luminosity in
this photosphere model. An $E_p-L$ tracking pattern can be reproduced if a certain positive dependence
between the dimensionless entropy $\eta$ and $L_w$ is introduced. However, the hard-to-soft evolution
pattern cannot be reproduced unless a contrived condition is invoked. In order to interpret the
Band spectrum, a more complicated photosphere model or a different energy dissipation and radiation
mechanism are needed.
