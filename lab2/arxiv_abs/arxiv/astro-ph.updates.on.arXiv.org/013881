We present sensitive and high angular resolution ($\sim$0.2-0.3$''$) (sub)millimeter (230 and
345 GHz) continuum and CO(2$-$1)/CO(3$-$2) line archive observations of the disk star system in
UX Tauri carried out with ALMA (The Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array). These observations
reveal the gas and dusty disk surrounding the young star UX Tauri A with a large signal-to-noise ratio
($>$400 in the continuum and $>$50 in the line), and for the first time is detected the molecular gas
emission associated with the disk of UX Tauri C (with a size for the disk of $<$56 au). No (sub)millimeter
continuum emission is detected at 5$\sigma$-level (0.2 mJy at 0.85 mm) associated with UX Tauri
C. For the component UX Tauri C, we estimate a dust disk mass of $\leq$ 0.05 M$_\oplus$. Additionally,
we report a strong tidal disk interaction between both disks UX Tauri A/C, separated 360 au in projected
distance. The CO line observations reveal marked spiral arms in the disk of UX Tauri A and an extended
redshifted stream of gas associated with the UX Tauri C disk. No spiral arms are observed in the dust
continuum emission of UX Tauri A. Assuming a Keplerian rotation we estimate the enclosed masses
(disk$+$star) from their radial velocities in 1.4 $\pm$ 0.6 M$_\odot$ for UX Tauri A, and 70 $\pm$
30 / $\sin i$ Jupiter masses for UX Tauri C (the latter coincides with the mass upper limit value for
a brown dwarf). The observational evidence presented here lead us to propose that UX Tauri C is having
a close approach of a possible wide, evolving and eccentric orbit around the disk of UX Tauri A causing
the formation of spiral arms and the stream of molecular gas falling towards UX Tauri C.
