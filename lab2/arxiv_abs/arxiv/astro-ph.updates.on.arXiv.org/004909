Quasars may have played a key role in limiting the stellar mass of massive galaxies. Identifying
those quasars in the process of removing star formation fuel from their hosts is an exciting ongoing
challenge in extragalactic astronomy. In this paper we present X-ray observations of eleven extremely
red quasars (ERQs) with $L_{\rm bol}\sim 10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at $z=1.5-3.2$ with evidence for
high-velocity ($v > 1000$ km s$^{-1}$) [OIII]$\lambda$5007\AA\ outflows. X-rays allow us to directly
probe circumnuclear obscuration and to measure the instantaneous accretion luminosity. We detect
ten out of eleven extremely red quasars available in targeted and archival data. Using a combination
of X-ray spectral fitting and hardness ratios, we find that all of the ERQs show signs of absorption
in the X-rays with inferred column densities of $N_{\rm H}\approx 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, including
four Compton-thick candidates ($N_{\rm H} > 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$). We stack the X-ray emission of
the seven weakly detected sources, measuring an average column density of $N_{\rm H}\sim 8\times
10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. The absorption-corrected (intrinsic) $2-10$ keV X-ray luminosity of the
stack is $2.7\times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, consistent with X-ray luminosities of type 1 quasars
of the same infrared luminosity. Thus, we find that ERQs are a highly obscured, borderline Compton-thick
population, and based on optical and infrared data we suggest that these objects are partially hidden
by their own equatorial outflows. However, unlike some quasars with known outflows, ERQs do not
appear to be intrinsically underluminous in X-rays for their bolometric luminosity. Our observations
indicate that low X-rays are not necessary to enable some types of radiatively driven winds.
