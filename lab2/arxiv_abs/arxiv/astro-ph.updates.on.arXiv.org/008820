We perform ideal MHD high resolution AMR simulations with driven turbulence and self-gravity and
find that long filamentary molecular clouds are formed at the converging locations of large-scale
turbulence flows and the filaments are bounded by gravity. The magnetic field helps shape and reinforce
the long filamentary structures. The main filamentary cloud has a length of ~4.4 pc. Instead of a
monolithic cylindrical structure, the main cloud is shown to be a collection of fiber/web-like
sub-structures similar to filamentary clouds such as L1495. Unless the line-of-sight is close
to the mean field direction, the large-scale magnetic field and striations in the simulation are
found roughly perpendicular to the long axis of the main cloud, similar to 1495. This provides strong
support for a large-scale moderately strong magnetic field surrounding L1495. We find that the
projection effect from observations can lead to incorrect interpretations of the true three-dimensional
physical shape, size, and velocity structure of the clouds. Helical magnetic field structures
found around filamentary clouds that are interpreted from Zeeman observations can be explained
by a simple bending of the magnetic field that pierces through the cloud. We demonstrate that two
dark clouds form a T-shape configuration which are strikingly similar to the Infrared dark cloud
SDC13 leading to the interpretation that SDC13 results from a collision of two long filamentary
clouds. We show that a moderately strong magnetic field (M_A ~ 1) is crucial for maintaining a long
and slender filamentary cloud for a long period of time ~0.5 million years.
