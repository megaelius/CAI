Context: AGILE is a gamma-ray astrophysics mission which has been in orbit since 23 April 2007 and
continues to operate reliably. The gamma-ray detector, AGILE-GRID, has observed Galactic and
extragalactic sources, many of which were collected in the first AGILE Catalog. Aims: We present
the calibration of the AGILE-GRID using in-flight data and Monte Carlo simulations, producing
Instrument Response Functions (IRFs) for the effective area A_eff), Energy Dispersion Probability
(EDP), and Point Spread Function (PSF), each as a function of incident direction in instrument coordinates
and energy. Methods: We performed Monte Carlo simulations at different gamma-ray energies and
incident angles, including background rejection filters and Kalman filter-based gamma-ray reconstruction.
Long integrations of in-flight observations of the Vela, Crab and Geminga sources in broad and narrow
energy bands were used to validate and improve the accuracy of the instrument response functions.
Results: The weighted average PSFs as a function of spectra correspond well to the data for all sources
and energy bands. Conclusions: Changes in the interpolation of the PSF from Monte Carlo data and
in the procedure for construction of the energy-weighted effective areas have improved the correspondence
between predicted and observed fluxes and spectra of celestial calibration sources, reducing
false positives and obviating the need for post-hoc energy-dependent scaling factors. The new
IRFs have been publicly available from the Agile Science Data Centre since November 25, 2011, while
the changes in the analysis software will be distributed in an upcoming release.
