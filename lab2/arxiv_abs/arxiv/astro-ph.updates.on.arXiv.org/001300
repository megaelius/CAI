We report the discovery of three planetary-mass companions (M = 6--20 $M_{Jup}$) in wide orbits
($\rho \sim$ 150--300 AU) around the young stars FW Tau (Taurus-Auriga), ROXs 12 (Ophiuchus), and
ROXs 42B (Ophiuchus). All three wide planetary-mass companions ("PMCs") were reported as candidate
companions in previous binary survey programs, but then were neglected for $>$10 years. We therefore
obtained followup observations which demonstrate that each candidate is comoving with its host
star. Based on the absolute $M_{K'}$ magnitudes, we infer masses (from hot-start evolutionary
models) and projected separations of 10 $\pm$ 4 $M_{Jup}$ and 330 $\pm$ 30 AU for FW Tau b, 16 $\pm$
4 $M_{Jup}$ and 210 $\pm$ 20 AU for ROXs 12 b, and 10 $\pm$ 4 $M_{Jup}$ and 140 $\pm$ 10 AU for ROXs 42B
b. We also present similar observations for ten other candidates which show that they are unassociated
field stars, as well as multicolor JHK'L' near-infrared photometry for our new PMCs and for five
previously-identified substellar or planetary-mass companions. The NIR photometry for our sample
of eight known and new companions generally parallels the properties of free-floating low-mass
brown dwarfs in these star-forming regions. However, 5 of the 7 objects with M $<$ 30 $M_{Jup}$
are redder in K'-L' than the distribution of young free-floating counterparts of similar J-K'.
We speculate that this distinction could indicate a structural difference in circum-planetary
disks, perhaps tied to higher disk mass since at least two of the objects in our sample are known to
be accreting more vigorously than typical free-floating counterparts.
