Astronomical imaging based on photon count data is a highly non-trivial task. In this context we
show how to denoise, deconvolve, and decompose multidimensional photon observations. The primary
objective is to incorporate accurate and well motivated likelihood and prior models in order to
give reliable estimates about morphologically different but superimposed photon flux components
present in the data set. Thereby we denoise and deconvolve single photon counts, while simultaneously
decomposing them into diffuse, point- like and uninteresting background radiation fluxes. The
decomposition is based on a probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian parameter model within the framework
of Information field theory (IFT). In contrast to its predecessor D3PO, its successor D4PO can reconstruct
components which depend on multiple parameters, each defined over its own independent manifold,
for example location and energy. Beyond that, D4PO may reconstruct correlation structures over
each of the component manifolds separately. Thereby the inferred correlations implicitly define
the morphologically different source components, except for the spatial correlations of the point-like
flux. These are by definition spatially uncorrelated. The capabilities of the algorithm are demonstrated
alongside a realistic high energy photon count data set. D4PO successfully denoised, deconvolved,
and decomposed a single photon count image into diffuse, point-like and background flux. Further
the algorithm provided a posteriori uncertainty estimates of the reconstructions and the correlation
structure of the fields with respect to the manifolds they reside on.
