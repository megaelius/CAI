Migration of dense gaseous clumps that form in young protostellar disks via gravitational fragmentation
is investigated to determine the likelihood of giant planet formation. High-resolution numerical
hydrodynamics simulations in the thin-disk limit are employed to compute the formation and long-term
evolution of a gravitationally unstable protostellar disk around a solar-mass star. We show that
gaseous clumps that form in the outer regions of the disk (>100 AU) through disk fragmentation are
often perturbed by other clumps or disk structures, such as spiral arms, and migrate toward the central
star on timescales from a few 10^3 to few 10^4 yr. The migration timescale is slowest when stellar
motion in response to the disk gravity is considered. When approaching the star, the clumps first
gain mass (up to several tens of M_Jup), but then quickly lose most of their diffuse envelopes through
tidal torques. Part of the clump envelope can be accreted on the central star causing an FU-Ori-type
accretion and luminosity outburst. The tidal mass loss helps the clumps to significantly slow down
or even halt their inward migration at a distance of a few tens of AU from the protostar. The resulting
clumps are heavily truncated both in mass and size compared to their wider-orbit counterparts,
keeping only a dense and hot nucleus. During the inward migration, the temperature in the clump interiors
may exceed the molecular hydrogen dissociation limit (2000 K) and the central region of the clump
can collapse into a gas giant protoplanet. We argue that FU-Orionis-type luminosity outbursts
may be the end product of disk fragmentation and clump inward migration, ushering the formation
of giant protoplanets on tens-of-au orbits in systems such as HR~8799.
