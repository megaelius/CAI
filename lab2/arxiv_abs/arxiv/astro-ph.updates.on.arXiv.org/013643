Recent observations of neutron stars with gravitational waves and X-ray timing provide unprecedented
access to the equation of state (EoS) of cold dense matter at densities difficult to realize in terrestrial
experiments. At the same time, predictions for the EoS with reliable uncertainty estimates from
chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) bound our theoretical ignorance. In this work, we analyze
astrophysical data using a nonparametric representation of the neutron star EoS conditioned on
$\chi$EFT to directly constrain the underlying physical properties of the compact objects. We
discuss how the data alone constrain the EoS at high densities when we condition on $\chi$EFT at low
densities. We also demonstrate how to exploit astrophysical data to directly test the predictions
of $\chi$EFT for the EoS up to twice nuclear saturation density, and estimate the density at which
these predictions might break down. We find that the existence of massive pulsars, gravitational
waves from GW170817, and NICER observations of PSR J0030+0451 favor $\chi$EFT predictions for
the EoS up to nuclear saturation density over a more agnostic analysis by a factor of 7 for the quantum
Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations used in this work. While $\chi$EFT predictions using QMC are fully
consistent with gravitational-wave data up to twice nuclear saturation, NICER observations suggest
that the EoS stiffens relative to these predictions at nuclear saturation density. Additionally,
we marginalize over the uncertainty in the density at which $\chi$EFT begins to break down, constraining
the radius of a $1.4\,M_\odot$ neutron star to $R_{1.4} = 11.40^{+1.38}_{-1.04}$ ($12.54^{+0.71}_{-0.63}$)
km and the pressure at twice nuclear saturation density to $p(2n_\mathrm{sat}) = 14.2^{+18.1}_{-8.4}$
($28.7^{+15.3}_{-15.0}$) $\mathrm{MeV}/\mathrm{fm}^3$ with massive pulsar and gravitational-wave
(and NICER) data.
