The Lyman Alpha Reference Sample (LARS) of 14 star-forming galaxies offers a wealth of insight into
the workings of these local analogs to high-redshift star-forming galaxies. The sample has been
well-studied in terms of LyA and other emission line properties, such as HI mass, gas kinematics,
and morphology. We analyze deep surface photometry of the LARS sample in UBIK broadband imaging
obtained at the Nordic Optical Telescope and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, and juxtaposition
their derived properties with a sample of local high-redshift galaxy analogs, namely, with blue
compact galaxies (BCGs). We construct radial surface brightness and color profiles with both elliptical
and isophotal integration, as well as RGB images, deep contours, color maps, a burst fraction estimate,
and a radial mass-to-light ratio profile for each LARS galaxy. Standard morphological parameters
like asymmetry, clumpiness, the Gini and M20 coefficients are [...] analyzed, as well as isophotal
asymmetry profiles for each galaxy. [...] We compare the LARS to the properties of the BCG sample
and highlight the differences. Several diagnostics indicate that the LARS galaxies have highly
disturbed morphologies even at the level of the faintest isophotes [...]. The ground-based photometry
[...] reveals previously unexplored isophotes [...]. The burst fraction estimate suggests a spatially
more extended burst region in LARS than in the BCGs. [...] The galaxies in the LARS sample appear to
be in earlier stages of a merger event compared to the BCGs. Standard morphological diagnostics
like asymmetry, clumpiness, Gini and M20 coefficients cannot separate the two samples, although
an isophotal asymmetry profile successfully captures the average difference in morphology. These
morphological diagnostics do not show any correlation with the equivalent width or the escape fraction
of Lyman Alpha. [abridged]
