In 1981, the Be/X-ray binary (Be/XRB) A0538-66 showed outbursts characterized by high peak luminosities
in the X-ray and optical bands. The optical outbursts were qualitatively explained as X-ray reprocessing
in a gas cloud surrounding the binary system. Since then, further important information about A0538-66
have been obtained, and sophisticated photoionization codes have been developed to calculate
the radiation emerging from a gas nebula illuminated by a central X-ray source. In the light of the
new information and tools available, we studied again the enhanced optical emission displayed
by A0538-66 to understand the mechanisms responsible for these unique events among the class of
Be/XRBs. We performed about 10^5 simulations of a gas envelope photoionized by an X-ray source.
We assumed for the shape of the gas cloud either a sphere or a circumstellar disc observed edge-on.
We studied the effects of varying the main properties of the envelope and the influence of different
input X-ray spectra on the optical/UV emission emerging from the photoionized cloud. We compared
the computed spectra with the IUE spectrum and photometric UBV measurements obtained during the
outburst of 29 April 1981. We also explored the role played by the X-ray heating of the surface of the
donor star irradiated by the X-ray emission of the neutron star (NS). We found that reprocessing
in a spherical cloud with a shallow radial density distribution can reproduce the optical/UV emission.
To our knowledge, this configuration has never been observed either in A0538-66 during other epochs
or in other Be/XRBs. We found, contrary to the case of most other Be/XRBs, that the optical/UV radiation
produced by the X-ray heating of the surface of the donor star irradiated by the NS is non-negligible,
due to the particular orbital parameters of this system that bring the NS very close to its companion.
