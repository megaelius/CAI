The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), launched successfully on 18th of April, 2018,
will observe nearly the full sky and will provide time-series imaging data in ~27-day-long campaigns.
TESS is equipped with 4 cameras; each has a field-of-view of 24x24 degrees. During the first two years
of the primary mission, one of these cameras, Camera #1, is going to observe fields centered at an
ecliptic latitude of 18 degrees. While the ecliptic plane itself is not covered during the primary
mission, the characteristic scale height of the main asteroid belt and Kuiper belt implies that
a significant amount of small solar system bodies will cross the field-of-view of this camera. Based
on the comparison of the expected amount of information of TESS and Kepler/K2, we can compute the
cumulative etendues of the two optical setups. This comparison results in roughly comparable optical
etendues, however the net etendue is significantly larger in the case of TESS since all of the imaging
data provided by the 30-minute cadence frames are downlinked rather than the pre-selected stamps
of Kepler/K2. In addition, many principles of the data acquisition and optical setup are clearly
different, including the level of confusing background sources, full-frame integration and cadence,
the field-of-view centroid with respect to the apparent position of the Sun, as well as the differences
in the duration of the campaigns. As one would expect, TESS will yield time-series photometry and
hence rotational properties for only brighter objects, but in terms of spatial and phase space coverage,
this sample will be more homogeneous and more complete. Here we review the main analogues and differences
between the Kepler/K2 mission and the TESS mission, focusing on scientific implications and possible
yields related to our Solar System.
