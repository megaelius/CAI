Stellar photospheres of post-asymptotic giant branch stars bear witness to the internal chemical
enrichment processes, integrated over their entire stellar evolution. Here we study post-AGB
stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). With their known distances, these rare objects are ideal
tracers of AGB nucleosynthesis and dredge-up phenomena. We used the UVES spectrograph mounted
on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) at the European Southern Observatory (ESO), to obtain high-resolution
spectra with high signal-to-noise (S/N) of a sample of four post-AGB stars. The objects display
a spectral energy distribution (SED) that indicates the presence of circumstellar dust. All objects
are carbon-rich, and strongly enhanced in s-process elements. We deduced abundances of heavy s-process
elements for all stars in the sample, and even found an indication of the presence of Hg in the spectrum
of one object. The metallicity of all stars except J053253.51-695915.1 is considerably lower than
the average value that is observed for the LMC. The derived luminosities show that we witness the
late evolution of low-mass stars with initial masses close to 1 solar mass. An exception is J053253.51-695915.1
and we argue that this object is likely a binary. We confirmed the correlation between the efficiency
of the third-dredge up and the neutron exposure that is detected in Galactic post-AGB stars. The
non-existence of a correlation between metallicity and neutron irradiation is also confirmed
and expanded to smaller metallicities. We confirm the status of 21-micron stars as post-Carbon
stars. Current theoretical AGB models overestimate the observed C/O ratios and fail to reproduce
the variety of s-process abundance patterns that is observed in otherwise very similar objects.
Similar results have recently been found for a post-AGB star in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC).
