We use 1169 Pan-STARRS supernovae (SNe) and 195 low-$z$ ($z < 0.1$) SNe Ia to measure cosmological
parameters. Though most Pan-STARRS SNe lack spectroscopic classifications, in a previous paper
(I) we demonstrated that photometrically classified SNe can be used to infer unbiased cosmological
parameters by using a Bayesian methodology that marginalizes over core-collapse (CC) SN contamination.
Our sample contains nearly twice as many SNe as the largest previous SN Ia compilation. Combining
SNe with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) constraints from Planck, we measure the dark energy
equation of state parameter $w$ to be -0.989$\pm$0.057 (stat$+$sys). If $w$ evolves with redshift
as $w(a) = w_0 + w_a(1-a)$, we find $w_0 = -0.912 \pm 0.149$ and $w_a =$ -0.513$\pm$0.826. These results
are consistent with cosmological parameters from the Joint Lightcurve Analysis and the Pantheon
sample. We try four different photometric classification priors for Pan-STARRS SNe and two alternate
ways of modeling CC SN contamination, finding that no variant gives a $w$ differing by more than 2%
from the baseline measurement. The systematic uncertainty on $w$ due to marginalizing over CC SN
contamination, $\sigma_w^{\textrm{CC}} = 0.012$, is the third-smallest source of systematic
uncertainty in this work. We find limited (1.6$\sigma$) evidence for evolution of the SN color-luminosity
relation with redshift, a possible systematic that could constitute a significant uncertainty
in future high-$z$ analyses. Our data provide one of the best current constraints on $w$, demonstrating
that samples with $\sim$5% CC SN contamination can give competitive cosmological constraints
when the contaminating distribution is marginalized over in a Bayesian framework.
