We present radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of radiatively-driven gas shells launched by
bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) in isolated dark matter haloes. Our goals are (1) to investigate
the ability of AGN radiation pressure on dust to launch galactic outflows and (2) to constrain the
efficiency of infrared (IR) multi-scattering in boosting outflow acceleration. Our simulations
are performed with the radiation-hydrodynamic code RAMSES-RT and include both single- and multi-scattered
radiation pressure from an AGN, radiative cooling and self-gravity. Since outflowing shells always
eventually become transparent to the incident radiation field, outflows that sweep up all intervening
gas are likely to remain gravitationally bound to their halo even at high AGN luminosities. The expansion
of outflowing shells is well described by simple analytic models as long as the shells are mildly
optically thick to IR radiation. In this case, an enhancement in the acceleration of shells through
IR multi-scattering occurs as predicted, i.e. a force dP/dt = tau_IR L/c is exerted on the gas. For
high optical depths tau_IR > 50, however, momentum transfer between outflowing optically thick
gas and IR radiation is rapidly suppressed, even if the radiation is efficiently confined. At high
tau_IR, the characteristic flow time becomes shorter than the required trapping time of IR radiation
such that the momentum flux dP/dt << tau_IR L/c. We argue that while unlikely to unbind massive galactic
gaseous haloes, AGN radiation pressure on dust could play an important role in regulating star formation
and black hole accretion in the nuclei of massive compact galaxies at high redshift.
