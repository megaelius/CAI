We have developed a new automated small-scale magnetic flux rope (SSMFR) detection algorithm based
on the Grad-Shafranov (GS) reconstruction technique. We have applied this detection algorithm
to the Wind spacecraft in-situ measurements during 1996 - 2016, covering two solar cycles, and successfully
detected a total number of 74,241 small-scale magnetic flux rope events with duration from 9 to 361
minutes. This large number of small-scale magnetic flux ropes has not been discovered by any other
previous studies through this unique approach. We perform statistical analysis of the small-scale
magnetic flux rope events based on our newly developed database, and summarize the main findings
as follows. (1) The occurrence of small-scale flux ropes has strong solar cycle dependency with
a rate of a few hundreds per month on average. (2) The small-scale magnetic flux ropes in the ecliptic
plane tend to align along the Parker spiral. (3) In low speed ($<$ 400 km/s) solar wind, the flux ropes
tend to have lower proton temperature and higher proton number density, while in high speed ($\ge$
400 km/s) solar wind, they tend to have higher proton temperature and lower proton number density.
(4) Both the duration and scale size distributions of the small-scale magnetic flux ropes obey a
power law. (5) The waiting time distribution of small-scale magnetic flux ropes can be fitted by
an exponential function (for shorter waiting times) and a power law function (for longer waiting
times). (6) The wall-to-wall time distribution obeys double power laws with the break point at 60
minutes (corresponding to the correlation length). (7) The small-scale magnetic flux ropes tend
to accumulate near the heliospheric current sheet (HCS). The entire database is available at \url{this
