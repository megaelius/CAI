A 70 Msun black hole was discovered in Milky Way disk in a long period (P=78.9d) and almost circular
($e=0.03$) detached binary system (LB-1) with an 8 Msun B star companion. The metallicity of the
B star is near solar (Z=0.02). Current consensus on the formation of black holes from high metallicity
stars limits the black hole mass to be below 20 Msun due to strong mass loss in stellar winds. Using
the Hurley et al. (2000) analytic evolutionary formulae, we show that the formation of a 70 Msun black
hole in high metallicity environment is possible if stellar wind mass loss rates, that are typically
adopted in evolutionary calculations, are reduced by factor of 0.2. Recent observational evidence
and theoretical calculations indicate that Vink et al. (2001) wind mass loss estimates may need
to be reduced by factors as low as 0.5-0.1. We also computed detailed stellar evolution models and
we confirm such a scenario. A non-rotating 85 Msun star model at Z=0.014 with decreased winds ends
up as a 71 Msun star prior core-collapse with a 32 Msun helium core and a 28 Msun CO core. Such star avoids
pair-instability pulsation supernova mass loss that severely limits black hole mass and may form
a 70 Msun black hole in the direct collapse. Stars that can form 70 Msun black holes at high Z expand
to significant size with radius of >600 Rsun (thanks to large H-rich envelope), however, exceeding
the size of LB-1 orbit (semi-major axis a<350 Rsun. Some of our stellar evolution models with reduced
mass loss rates appear to be consistent with the formation of black holes upto 70 Msun at high metallicity,
but unable to explain how a binary star system like LB-1 could have formed without invoking some exotic
scenarios.
