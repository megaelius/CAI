The current concordance model of cosmology is dominated by two mysterious ingredients: dark matter
and dark energy. In this paper, we explore the possibility that, in fact, there exist two dark-energy
components: the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, with equation-of-state parameter $w_\Lambda=-1$,
and a `missing matter' component $X$ with $w_X=-2/3$, which we introduce here to allow the evolution
of the universal scale factor as a function of conformal time to exhibit a symmetry that relates the
big bang to the future conformal singularity, such as in Penrose's conformal cyclic cosmology.
Using recent cosmological observations, we constrain the present-day energy density of missing
matter to be $\Omega_{X,0}=-0.034 \pm 0.075$. This is consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM
model, but constraints on the energy densities of all the components are considerably broadened
by the introduction of missing matter; significant relative probability exists even for $\Omega_{X,0}
\sim 0.1$, and so the presence of a missing matter component cannot be ruled out. As a result, a Bayesian
model selection analysis only slightly disfavours its introduction by 1.1 log-units of evidence.
Foregoing our symmetry requirement on the conformal time evolution of the universe, we extend our
analysis by allowing $w_X$ to be a free parameter. For this more generic `double dark energy' model,
we find $w_X = -1.01 \pm 0.16$ and $\Omega_{X,0} = -0.10 \pm 0.56$, which is again consistent with
the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, although once more the posterior distributions are sufficiently
broad that the existence of a second dark-energy component cannot be ruled out. The model including
the second dark energy component also has an equivalent Bayesian evidence to $\Lambda$CDM, within
the estimation error, and is indistinguishable according to the Jeffreys guideline.
