We study the image formation process with the solar gravitational lens (SGL) in the case of an extended,
resolved source. An imaging telescope, modeled as a convex lens, is positioned within the image
cylinder formed by the light received from the source. In the strong interference region of the SGL,
this light is greatly amplified, forming the Einstein ring around the Sun, representing a distorted
image of the extended source. We study the intensity distribution within the Einstein ring observed
in the focal plane of the convex lens. For any particular telescope position in the image plane, we
model light received from the resolved source as a combination of two signals: light received from
the directly imaged region of the source and light from the rest of the source. We also consider the
case when the telescope points away from the extended source or, equivalently, it observes light
from sources in sky positions that are some distance away from the extended source, but still in its
proximity. At even larger distances from the optical axis, in the weak interference or geometric
optics regions, our approach recovers known models related to microlensing, but now obtained via
the wave-optical treatment. We then derive the power of the signal and related photon fluxes within
the annulus that contains the Einstein ring of the extended source, as seen by the imaging telescope.
We discuss the properties of the deconvolution process, especially its effects on noise in the recovered
image. We compare anticipated signals from realistic exoplanetary targets against estimates
of noise from the solar corona and estimate integration times needed for the recovery of high-quality
images of faint sources. The results demonstrate that the SGL offers a unique, realistic capability
to obtain resolved images of exoplanets in our galactic neighborhood.
