Multi-band phase variations in principle allow us to infer the longitudinal temperature distributions
of planets as a function of height in their atmospheres. For example, 3.6 micron emission originates
from deeper layers of the atmosphere than 4.5 micron due to greater water vapor absorption at the
longer wavelength. Since heat transport efficiency increases with pressure, we expect thermal
phase curves at 3.6 micron to exhibit smaller amplitudes and greater phase offsets than at 4.5 micron;
this trend is not observed. Of the seven hot Jupiters with full-orbit phase curves at 3.6 and 4.5 micron,
all have greater phase amplitude at 3.6 micron than at 4.5 micron, while four of seven exhibit a greater
phase offset at 3.6 micron. We use a 3D radiative-hydrodynamic model to calculate theoretical phase
curves of HD 189733b, assuming thermo-chemical equilibrium. The model exhibits temperature,
pressure, and wavelength dependent opacity, primarily driven by carbon chemistry: CO is energetically
favored on the dayside, while CH4 is favored on the cooler nightside. Infrared opacity therefore
changes by orders of magnitude between day and night, producing dramatic vertical shifts in the
wavelength-specific photospheres, which would complicate eclipse or phase mapping with spectral
data. The model predicts greater relative phase amplitude and greater phase offset at 3.6 micron
than at 4.5 micron, in agreement with the data. Our model qualitatively explains the observed phase
curves, but is in tension with current thermo-chemical kinetics models that predict zonally uniform
atmospheric composition due to transport of CO from the hot regions of the atmosphere.
