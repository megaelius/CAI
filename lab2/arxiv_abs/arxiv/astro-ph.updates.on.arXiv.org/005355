Global 3D simulations of solar giant-cell convection have provided significant insight into the
processes which yield the Sun's observed differential rotation and cyclic dynamo action. However,
as we move to higher resolution simulations a variety of codes have encountered what has been termed
the convection conundrum. As these simulations increase in resolution and hence the level of turbulence
achieved, they tend to produce weak or even anti-solar differential rotation patterns associated
with a weak rotational influence (high Rossby number) due to large convective velocities. One potential
culprit for this convection conundrum is the upper boundary condition applied in most simulations
which is generally impenetrable. Here we present an alternative stochastic plume boundary condition
which imposes small-scale convective plumes designed to mimic near-surface convective downflows,
thus allowing convection to carry the majority of the outward solar energy flux up to and through
our simulated upper boundary. The use of a plume boundary condition leads to significant changes
in the convective driving realized in the simulated domain and thus to the convective energy transport,
the dominant scale of the convective enthalpy flux, and the relative strength of the strongest downflows,
the downflow network, and the convective upflows. These changes are present even far from the upper
boundary layer. Additionally, we demonstrate that in spite of significant changes, giant cell
morphology in the convective patterns is still achieved with self-organization of the imposed
boundary plumes into downflow lanes, cellular patterns, and even rotationally-aligned banana
cells in equatorial regions. This plume boundary presents an alternative pathway for 3D global
convection simulations where driving is non-local and may provide a new approach towards addressing
the convection conundrum.
