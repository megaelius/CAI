We use observed radial profiles of mass surface densities of total, $\Sigma_g$, & molecular,
$\Sigma_{\rm H2}$, gas, rotation velocity & star formation rate (SFR) surface density, $\Sigma_{\rm
sfr}$, of the molecular-rich ($\Sigma_{\rm H2}\ge\Sigma_{\rm HI}/2$) regions of 16 nearby disk
galaxies to test several star formation laws: a Kennicutt-Schmidt law, $\Sigma_{\rm sfr}=A_g\Sigma_{g,2}^{1.5}$;
a Constant Molecular law, $\Sigma_{\rm sfr}=A_{\rm H2}\Sigma_{\rm H2,2}$; the turbulence-regulated
laws of Krumholz & McKee (KM05) and Krumholz et al. (KMT09), a Gas-$\Omega$ law, $\Sigma_{\rm
sfr}=B_\Omega\Sigma_g\Omega$; and a shear-driven GMC Collision law, $\Sigma_{\rm sfr}=B_{\rm
CC}\Sigma_g\Omega(1-0.7\beta)$, where $\beta\equiv d {\rm ln} v_{\rm circ}/d {\rm ln} r$. If
allowed one free normalization parameter for each galaxy, these laws predict the SFR with rms errors
of factors of 1.4 - 1.8. If a single normalization parameter is used by each law for the entire galaxy
sample, then rms errors range from factors of 1.5 - 2.1. Although the Constant Molecular law gives
the smallest errors, the improvement over KMT, Kennicutt-Schmidt & GMC Collision laws is not
especially significant, particularly given the different observational inputs that the laws
utilize and the scope of included physics, which ranges from empirical relations to detailed treatment
of interstellar medium processes. We next search for variation of star formation law parameters
with local & global galactic dynamical properties of disk shear rate (related to $\beta$),
rotation speed & presence of a bar. We demonstrate with high significance that higher shear
rates enhance star formation efficiency per local orbital time. Such a trend is expected if GMC collisions
play an important role in star formation, while an opposite trend would be expected if development
of disk gravitational instabilities is the controlling physics.
