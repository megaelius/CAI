We use deep $HST$ WFC3/IR imaging to study the Initial Mass Function (IMF) of the ultra faint dwarf
galaxy Coma Berenices (Com Ber). Our observations reach the lowest stellar mass ever probed in a
resolved galaxy, with 50\% completeness at $\sim 0.17$ M$_{\odot}$. Unresolved background galaxies
however limit our purity below $\sim 0.23$ M$_{\odot}$. If modeled with a single power law, we find
that the IMF slope is $-1.45^{+0.29}_{-0.3}$ (68\% credible intervals), compared to a Milky Way
value of $-2.3$. For a broken power law, we obtain a low-mass slope of $-1.18_{-0.33}^{+0.49}$,
a high-mass slope of $-1.88_{-0.49}^{+0.43}$ and a break mass of $0.57_{-0.08}^{+0.12}$ M$_{\odot}$,
compared to $-1.3$, $-2.3$ and 0.5 M$_{\odot}$ for a Kroupa IMF. For a log-normal IMF model we obtain
values of $0.33_{-0.16}^{+0.15}$ M$_{\odot}$ for the location parameter and of $0.68_{-0.12}^{+0.17}$
for $\sigma$ (0.22 M$_{\odot}$ and 0.57 for the Chabrier system IMF). All three parametrizations
produce similar agreement with the data. Our results agree with previous analysis of shallower
optical HST data. However analysis of similar optical data of other dwarfs finds IMFs significantly
more bottom-light than in the Milky Way. These results suggest two, non mutually exclusive, possibilities:
that the discrepancy of the dwarf galaxies IMF with respect to the Milky Way is, at least partly, an
artifact of using a single power law model, and that there is real variance in the IMF at low masses
between the currently studied nearby dwarfs, with Com Ber being similar to the Milky Way, but other
dwarfs differing significantly.
