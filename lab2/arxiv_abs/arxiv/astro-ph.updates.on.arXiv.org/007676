Large scale filaments, with lengths that can reach tens of Mpc, are the most prominent features in
the cosmic web. These filaments have only been observed indirectly through the positions of galaxies
in large galaxy surveys or through absorption features in the spectra of high redshift sources.
In this study we propose to go one step further and directly detect intergalactic medium filaments
through their emission in the HI 21cm line. We make use of high resolution cosmological simulations
to estimate the intensity of this emission in low redshift filaments and use it to make predictions
for the direct detectability of specific filaments previously inferred from galaxy surveys, in
particular the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Given the expected signal of these filaments our study
shows that HI emission from large filaments can be observed by current and next generation radio
telescopes. We estimate that gas in filaments of length $l \gtrsim$ 15 $h^{-1}$Mpc with relatively
small inclinations to the line of sight ($\lesssim 10^\circ$) can be observed in $\sim40-100$ hours
with telescopes such as GMRT or EVLA, potentially providing large improvements over our knowledge
of the astrophysical properties of these filaments. Due to their large field of view and sufficiently
long integration times, upcoming HI surveys with the Apertif and ASKAP instruments will be able
to detect large filaments independently of their orientation and curvature. Furthermore, our
estimates indicate that a more powerful future radio telescope like SKA-2 can be used to map most
of these filaments, which will allow them to be used as a strong cosmological probe.
