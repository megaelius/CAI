The World Space Observatory for Ultraviolet (WSO-UV) is an orbital optical telescope with a 1.7
m-diameter primary mirror currently under development. The WSO-UV is aimed to operate in the 115-310
nm UV spectral range. Its two major science instruments are UV spectrographs and a UV imaging field
camera with filter wheels. The WSO-UV project is currently in the implementation phase, with a tentative
launch date in 2023. Recently, two additional instruments devoted to exoplanets have been proposed
for WSO-UV, which are the focus of this paper. UVSPEX, a UV-Spectrograph for Exoplanets, aims to
determine atomic hydrogen and oxygen abundance in the exospheres of terrestrial exoplanets. The
spectral range is 115-130 nm which enables simultaneous measurement of hydrogen and oxygen emission
intensities during an exoplanet transit. Study of exosphere transit photometric curves can help
differentiate among different types of rocky planets. The exospheric temperature of an Earth-like
planet is much higher than that of a Venus-like planet, because of the low mixing ratio of the dominant
coolant (CO2) in the upper atmosphere of the former, which causes a large difference in transit depth
at the oxygen emission line. Thus, whether the terrestrial exoplanet is Earth-like, Venus-like,
or other can be determined. SCEDI, a Stellar Coronagraph for Exoplanet Direct Imaging is aimed to
directly detect the starlight reflected from exoplanets orbiting their parent stars or from the
stellar vicinity including circumstellar discs, dust, and clumps. SCEDI will create an achromatic
(optimized to 420-700 nm wavelength range), high-contrast stellocentric coronagraphic image
of a circumstellar vicinity. The two instruments: UVSPEX and SCEDI, share common power and control
modules. The present communication outlines the science goals of both proposed instruments and
explains some of their engineering features.
