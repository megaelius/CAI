Recent work has suggested that mid-IR wavelengths are optimal for estimating the mass-to-light
ratios of stellar populations and hence the stellar masses of galaxies. We compare stellar masses
deduced from spectral energy distribution (SED) models, fitted to multi-wavelength optical-NIR
photometry, to luminosities derived from {\it WISE} photometry in the $W1$ and $W2$ bands at 3.6
and 4.5$\mu$m for non-star forming galaxies. The SED derived masses for a carefully selected sample
of low redshift ($z \le 0.15$) passive galaxies agree with the prediction from stellar population
synthesis models that $M_*/L_{W1} \simeq 0.6$ for all such galaxies, independent of other stellar
population parameters. The small scatter between masses predicted from the optical SED and from
the {\it WISE} measurements implies that random errors (as opposed to systematic ones such as the
use of different IMFs) are smaller than previous, deliberately conservative, estimates for the
SED fits. This test is subtly different from simultaneously fitting at a wide range of optical and
mid-IR wavelengths, which may just generate a compromise fit: we are directly checking that the
best fit model to the optical data generates an SED whose $M_*/L_{W1}$ is also consistent with separate
mid-IR data. We confirm that for passive low redshift galaxies a fixed $M_*/L_{W1} = 0.65$ can generate
masses at least as accurate as those obtained from more complex methods. Going beyond the mean value,
in agreement with expectations from the models, we see a modest change in $M_*/L_{W1}$ with SED fitted
stellar population age but an insignificant one with metallicity.
