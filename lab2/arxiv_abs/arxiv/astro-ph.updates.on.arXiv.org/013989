The accretion-induced collapse (AIC) scenario was proposed 40 years ago as an evolutionary end
state of oxygen-neon white-dwarfs (ONe WDs), linking them to the formation of neutron star (NS)
systems. However, there has been no direct detection of any AIC event so far, even though there exists
a lot of indirect observational evidence. Meanwhile, the evolutionary pathways resulting in NS
formation through AIC are still not well investigated. In this article, we review recent studies
on the two classic progenitor models of AIC events, i.e., the single-degenerate model (including
the ONe WD+MS/RG/He star channels and the CO WD+He star channel) and the double-degenerate model
(including the double CO/ONe WD channels and the ONe WD+CO WD channel). Recent progress on these
progenitor models is reviewed, including the evolutionary scenarios, the initial parameter space
and the related objects. For the single-degenerate model, the pre-AIC systems could potentially
be identified as cataclysmic variables, symbiotics and supersoft X-ray sources, whereas the post-AIC
systems could be identified as low-/intermediate-mass X-ray binaries and the resulting low-/intermediate-mass
binary pulsars, most notably millisecond pulsars. For the double-degenerate model, the pre-AIC
systems are close double WDs, whereas the post-AIC systems are isolated NSs with peculiar properties.
We also review the predicted rates of AIC events, the mass distribution of NSs, and the gravitational
wave (GW) signals from double WDs that are potential GW sources in the Galaxy in the context of future
space-based GW detectors. Recent theoretical and observational constraints on the detection
of AIC events are summarized. In order to confirm the existence of the AIC process, and resolve this
long-term issue presented by current stellar evolution theories, more numerical simulations
and observational identifications are required.
