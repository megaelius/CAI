We present the completion of a data analysis pipeline that self-consistently separates global
21-cm signals from large systematics using a pattern recognition technique. In the first paper
of this series, we obtain optimal basis vectors from signal and foreground training sets to linearly
fit both components with the minimal number of terms that best extracts the signal given its overlap
with the foreground. In this second paper, we utilize the spectral constraints derived in the first
paper to calculate the full posterior probability distribution of any signal parameter space of
choice. The spectral fit provides the starting point for a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) engine
that samples the signal without traversing the foreground parameter space. At each MCMC step, we
marginalize over the weights of all linear foreground modes and suppress those with unimportant
variations by applying priors gleaned from the training set. This method drastically reduces the
number of MCMC parameters, augmenting the efficiency of exploration, circumvents the need for
selecting a minimal number of foreground modes, and allows the complexity of the foreground model
to be greatly increased to simultaneously describe many observed spectra without requiring extra
MCMC parameters. Using two nonlinear signal models, one based on EDGES observations and the other
on phenomenological frequencies and temperatures of theoretically expected extrema, we demonstrate
the success of this methodology by recovering the input parameters from multiple randomly simulated
signals at low radio frequencies (10-200 MHz), while rigorously accounting for realistically
modeled beam-weighted foregrounds.
