In recent years, observers have found that the fraction of M-stars demonstrating significant magnetic
activity transitions sharply from roughly $10\%$ for main-sequence stars earlier (more massive)
than spectral type M3.5 (0.35 M$_\odot$) to nearly $90\%$ for stars later than M3.5. The latter are
typically rotating quite rapidly, suggesting differing spin-down histories. Tantalizingly,
it is also later than M3.5 at which main-sequence stars become fully convective, and may no longer
contain a tachocline, a layer of rotational shear revealed by helioseismology to separate the radiative
zone (RZ) and convection zone (CZ). We turn here to the more massive M-stars to study the impact such
a layer may have on their internal dynamics. Using the spherical 3D MHD simulation code Rayleigh,
we compare the properties of convective dynamos generated within quickly rotating (1, 2, and 4 $\Omega_\odot$)
M2 (0.4 M$_\odot$) stars, with the computational domain either terminating at the base of the convection
zone or permitting overshoot into the underlying stable region. We find that a tachocline is not
necessary for the organization of strong toroidal wreaths of magnetism in these stars, though its
presence can increase the coupling of mean field amplitudes to the stellar rotation rate. Additionally,
in stars that undergo periodic cycles, we find that the presence of a tachocline tends to make the
cycles both longer and more regular than they would have otherwise been. Finally, we find that the
tachocline helps to enhance the surface poloidal fields and organize them into larger spatial scales,
both of which provide favorable conditions for more rapid angular momentum loss through a magnetized
stellar wind.
