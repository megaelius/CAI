Some high-resolution observations have revealed that the active-region solar corona is filled
with myriads of thin strands even in apparently uniform regions with no resolved loops. This fine
structure can host collective oscillations involving a large portion of the corona due to the coupling
of the motions of the neighbouring strands. We study these vibrations and the possible observational
effects. Here we theoretically investigate the collective oscillations inherent to the fine structure
of the corona. We have called them fundamental vibrations because they cannot exist in a uniform
medium. We use the T-matrix technique to find the normal modes of random arrangements of parallel
strands. We consider an increasing number of tubes to understand the vibrations of a huge number
of tubes of a large portion of the corona. We additionally generate synthetic time-distance Doppler
and line broadening diagrams of the vibrations of a coronal region to compare with observations.
We have found that the fundamental vibrations are in the form of clusters of tubes where not all the
tubes participate in the collective mode. The periods are distributed over a wide band of values.
The width of the band increases with the number of strands but rapidly reaches an approximately constant
value. The frequency band associated with the fine structure of the corona depends on the minimum
separation between strands. We have found that the coupling between the strands is of large extent.
The synthetic Dopplergrams and line-broadening maps show signatures of collective vibrations,
not present in the case of purely random individual kink vibrations. We conclude that the fundamental
vibrations of the corona can contribute to the energy budget of the corona and they may have an observational
signature.
