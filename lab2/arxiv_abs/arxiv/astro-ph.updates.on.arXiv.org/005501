We present and discuss the orbital content of a rather unusual rotating barred galaxy model, in which
the three-dimensional (3D) family, bifurcating from x1 at the 2:1 vertical resonance with the known
"frown-smile" side-on morphology, is unstable. Our goal is to study the differences that occur
in the phase space structure at the vertical 2:1 resonance region in this case, with respect to the
known, well studied, standard case, in which the families with the frown-smile profiles are stable
and support an X-shaped morphology. The potential used in the study originates in a frozen snapshot
of an $N$-body simulation in which a fast bar has evolved. We follow the evolution of the vertical
stability of the central family of periodic orbits as a function of the energy (Jacobi constant)
and we investigate the phase space content by means of spaces of section. The two bifurcating families
at the vertical 2:1 resonance region of the new model change their stability with respect to that
of most studied analytic potentials. The structure in the side-on view that is directly supported
by the trapping of quasi-periodic orbits around 3D stable periodic orbits has now an infinity symbol
(i.e. $\infty$-type) profile. However, the available sticky orbits can reinforce other types
of side-on morphologies as well. In the new model, the dynamical mechanism of trapping quasi-periodic
orbits around the 3D stable periodic orbits that build the peanut, supports the $\infty$-type profile.
The same mechanism in the standard case supports the X shape with the frown-smile orbits. Nevertheless,
in both cases (i.e. in the new and in the standard model) a combination of 3D quasi-periodic orbits
around the stable x1 family with sticky orbits can support a profile reminiscent of the shape of the
orbits of the 3D unstable family existing in each model.
