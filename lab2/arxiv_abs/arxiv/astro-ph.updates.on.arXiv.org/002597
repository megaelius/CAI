Gravitationally lensed (GL) quasars are brighter than their unlensed counterparts and produce
images with distinctive morphological signatures. Past searches and target selection algorithms,
in particular the Sloan Quasar Lens Search (SQLS), have relied on basic morphological criteria,
which were applied to samples of bright, spectroscopically confirmed quasars. The SQLS techniques
are not sufficient for searching into new surveys (e.g. DES, PS1, LSST), because spectroscopic
information is not readily available and the large data volume requires higher purity in target/candidate
selection. We carry out a systematic exploration of machine learning techniques and demonstrate
that a two step strategy can be highly effective. In the first step we use catalog-level information
($griz$+WISE magnitudes, second moments) to preselect targets, using artificial neural networks.
The accepted targets are then inspected with pixel-by-pixel pattern recognition algorithms (Gradient-Boosted
Trees), to form a final set of candidates. The results from this procedure can be used to further refine
the simpler SQLS algorithms, with a twofold (or threefold) gain in purity and the same (or $80\%$)
completeness at target-selection stage, or a purity of $70\%$ and a completeness of $60\%$ after
the candidate-selection step. Simpler photometric searches in $griz$+WISE based on colour cuts
would provide samples with $7\%$ purity or less. Our technique is extremely fast, as a list of candidates
can be obtained from a stage III experiment (e.g. DES catalog/database) in {a few} CPU hours. The
techniques are easily extendable to Stage IV experiments like LSST with the addition of time domain
information.
