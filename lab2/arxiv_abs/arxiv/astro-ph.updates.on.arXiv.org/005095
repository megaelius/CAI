In December 2015 the black hole binary V404 Cyg underwent a secondary outburst after the main June
2015 event. We monitored this re-brightening with the INTEGRAL and Swift satellites, and in this
paper we report the results of the time-resolved spectral analysis of these data. The December outburst
shared similar characteristics with the June one. The well sampled INTEGRAL light curve shows up
to 10 Crab flares, which are separated by relatively weak non-flaring emission phases when compared
to the June outburst. The spectra are well described by absorbed Comptonization models, with hard
photon indices, $\Gamma \lesssim 2$, and significant detections of a high-energy cut-off only
during the bright flares. This is in contrast to the June outburst, where the Comptonization models
gave electron temperatures mostly in the 30--50 keV range, while some spectra were soft ($\Gamma
\sim 2.5$) without signs of any spectral cut-off. Similarly to the June outburst, we see clear sings
of a variable local absorber in the soft energy band covered by Swift/XRT and INTEGRAL/JEM-X, which
causes rapid spectral variations observed during the flares. During one flare, both Swift and INTEGRAL
captured V404 Cyg in a state where the absorber was nearly Compton thick, $N_\textrm{H} \approx
10^{24}\,\textrm{cm}^{-2}$, and the broad band spectrum was similar to obscured AGN spectra,
as seen during the "plateaus" in the June outburst. We conclude that the spectral behaviour of V404
Cyg during the December outburst was analogous with the first few days of the June outburst, both
having hard X-ray flares that were intermittently influenced by obscuration due to nearly Compton-thick
outflows launched from the accretion disc.
