(Abridged) Any viable cosmological model in which galaxies interact predicts the existence of
primordial and tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs). In particular, in the standard model of cosmology ($\Lambda$CDM),
according to the dual dwarf galaxy theorem, there must exist both primordial dark matter-dominated
and dark matter-free TDGs with different radii. We study the frequency, evolution, and properties
of TDGs in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We use the hydrodynamical cosmological Illustris-1 simulation
to identify tidal dwarf galaxy candidates (TDGCs) and study their present-day physical properties.
We also present movies on the formation of a few galaxies lacking dark matter, confirming their tidal
dwarf nature. TDGCs can however also be formed via other mechanisms, such as from ram-pressure-stripped
material or, speculatively, from cold-accreted gas. We find 97 TDGCs with $M_{stellar} >5 \times
10^7 M_\odot$ at redshift $z = 0$, corresponding to a co-moving number density of $2.3 \times 10^{-4}
h^3 cMpc^{-3}$. The most massive TDGC has $M_{total} = 3.1 \times 10^9 M_\odot$, comparable to that
of the Large Magellanic Cloud. TDGCs are phase-space-correlated, reach high metallicities, and
are typically younger than dark matter-rich dwarf galaxies. We report for the first time the verification
of the dual dwarf theorem in a self-consistent $\Lambda$CDM cosmological simulation. Simulated
TDGCs and dark matter-dominated galaxies populate different regions in the radius-mass diagram
in disagreement with observations of early-type galaxies. The dark matter-poor galaxies formed
in Illustris-1 have comparable radii to observed dwarf galaxies and to TDGs formed in other galaxy-encounter
simulations. In Illustris-1, only 0.17% of all selected galaxies with $M_{stellar} = 5 \times 10^7-10^9
M_\odot$ are TDGCs or dark matter-poor dwarf galaxies. The occurrence of NGC 1052-DF2-type objects
is discussed.
