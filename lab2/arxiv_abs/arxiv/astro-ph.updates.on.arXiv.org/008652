The hard X-ray sky at energies above 10 keV, has been extensively explored by the Swift and the NuSTAR
missions in the 14-195 keV and the 3-24 keV bands respectively. The major population of the hard X-ray
detected sources are AGN. We compare the number count distributions derived from the swift 105-month
catalogue with those from the serendipitous NuSTAR source catalogue. In the 14-195 keV band, the
Swift/BAT counts follow a Euclidean slope with alpha=1.51+/-0.10 (90% confidence level). The
NuSTAR counts in the 8-24 keV band present a steeper slope with alpha = 1.71+/- 0.2$, because of an
upturn at fluxes below ~2x10^{-13} erg/cm2/s. The same upturn is observed in the soft (3-8 keV) NuSTAR
number counts, which in overall also present a steep slope with alpha = 1.82+/- 0.15. Only the bright
part of the NuSTAR 3-8 keV counts agrees with the chandra number counts in the 2-10 keV band while the
fainter part (<7x10^{-13} erg/cm2/s ) of the soft NuSTAR counts is in marked disagreement with the
chandra counts. Next, we compare the derived number counts in the different bands using our X-ray
AGN population synthesis models. The comparison between the Chandra and the Swift/BAT number counts
shows a very good agreement for the 'standard' AGN spectrum with a power-law slope Gamma=1.9, a high
energy cut-off at ~130 keV and a 2-10 keV reflection component of 3%. On the other hand, using the above
standard AGN spectral model, only the bright part of the NuSTAR 8-24 keV and 3-8 keV number counts,
agree with the model predictions. Then it is most likely that the disagreement between the X-ray
number counts in the different bands is because of the faint NuSTAR number counts. We discuss various
possibilities for the origin of this disagreement.
