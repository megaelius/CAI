We present CO(J= 1-0; 3-2; 5-4; 10-9) and 1.2-kpc resolution [CII] line observations of the dusty
star-forming galaxy (SFG) HXMM05 -- carried out with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, the Combined
Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy, the Plateau de Bure Interferometer, and the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, measuring an unambiguous redshift of z = 2.9850+/-0.0009.
We find that HXMM05 is a hyper-luminous infrared galaxy (LIR=(4+/-1)x10^13 Lsun) with a total molecular
gas mass of (2.1+/-0.7)x10^11 (alpha_CO/0.8) Msun. The CO(J=1-0) and [CII] emission are extended
over ~9 kpc in diameter, and the CO line FWHM exceeds 1100 km s^-1. The [CII] emission shows a monotonic
velocity gradient consistent with a disk, with a maximum rotation velocity of v_c = 616+/-100 km
s^-1 and a dynamical mass of (7.7+/-3.1)x10^11 Msun. We find a star formation rate (SFR) of 2900^750_-595
Msun yr^-1. HXMM05 is thus among the most intensely star-forming galaxies known at high redshift.
Photo-dissociation region modeling suggests physical conditions similar to nearby SFGs, showing
extended star formation, which is consistent with our finding that the gas and dust emission are
co-spatial. Its molecular gas excitation resembles the local major merger Arp 220. The broad CO
and [CII] lines and a pair of compact dust nuclei suggest the presence of a late-stage major merger
at the center of the extended disk, again reminiscent of Arp 220. The observed gas kinematics and
conditions together with the presence of a companion and the pair of nuclei suggest that HXMM05 is
experiencing multiple mergers as a part of the evolution.
