In their evolution, star-forming galaxies are known to follow scaling relations between some fundamental
physical quantities, such as the mass-metallicity and the main sequence relations. We aim at studying
the evolution of galaxies that, at a given redshift, lie simultaneously on the mass-metallicity
(MZ) and main sequence (MS) relations. To this aim, we use the analytical, 'leaky-box' chemical
evolution model of Spitoni et al. (2017), in which galaxy evolution is described by an infall timescale
$\tau$ and a wind efficiency $\lambda$. We provide a detailed analysis of the temporal evolution
of galactic metallicity, stellar mass, mass-weighted age and gas fraction. The evolution of the
galaxies lying on the MZ and MS at $z\sim0.1$ suggests that the average infall time-scale in two different
bins of stellar masses ($M_{\star}<10^{10} M_{\odot}$ and $M_{\star}>10^{10} M_{\odot}$) decreases
with decreasing redshift. This means that at each redshift, only the youngest galaxies can be assembled
on the shortest timescales and still belong to the MS. In the lowest mass bin, a decrease of the median
$\tau$ is accompanied by an increase of the median $\lambda$ value. This implies that systems which
have formed at more recent times will need to eject a larger amount of mass to keep their metallicity
at low values. Another important result is that galactic downsizing, as traced by the age-mass relation,
is naturally recovered by imposing that local galaxies lie on both the MZ and MS. Finally, we study
the evolution of the hosts of C IV-selected AGN, which at $z\sim 2$ follow a flat MZ, as found by Mignoli
et al. (2019). If we impose that these systems lie on the MS, at lower redshifts we find an 'inverted'
MZ, meaning that some additional processes must be at play in their evolution.
