Direct imaging surveys have discovered wide-orbit planetary-mass companions that challenge
existing models of both star and planet formation, but their demographics remain poorly sampled.
We have developed an automated binary companion point spread function (PSF) fitting pipeline to
take advantage of Spitzer's infrared sensitivity to planetary-mass objects and circum(sub)stellar
disks, measuring photometry across the four IRAC channels of 3.6 $\mu$m, 4.5 $\mu$m, 5.8 $\mu$m,
and 8.0 $\mu$m. We present PSF-fitting photometry of archival Spitzer/IRAC images for 11 young,
low-mass ($M\sim0.044$-0.88 $M_{\odot}$; M7.5-K3.5) members of three nearby star-forming regions
(Chameleon, Taurus, and Upper Scorpius; $d\sim$ 150 pc; $\tau\sim$ 1-10 Myr) that host confirmed
or candidate faint companions at $\rho = 1.68^{\prime\prime}-7.31^{\prime\prime}$. We recover
all system primaries, six confirmed, and two candidate low-mass companions in our sample. We also
measure non-photospheric $[3.6]-[8.0]$ colors for three of the system primaries, four of the confirmed
companions, and one candidate companion, signifying the presence of circumstellar or circum(sub)stellar
disks. We furthermore report the confirmation of a $\rho=4.66^{\prime\prime}$ (540 au) companion
to [SCH06] J0359+2009 which was previously identified as a candidate via imaging over five years
ago, but was not studied further. Based on its brightness ($M_{[3.6]}=8.53$ mag), we infer the companion
mass to be $M=20\pm5$ $M_\mathrm{Jup}$ given the primary's model-derived age of 10 Myr. Our framework
is sensitive to companions with masses less than 10 $M_\mathrm{Jup}$ at separations of $\rho = 300$
au in nearby star-forming regions, opening up a new regime of parameter space that has yet to be studied
in detail, discovering planetary-mass companions in their birth environments and revealing their
circum(sub)stellar disks.
