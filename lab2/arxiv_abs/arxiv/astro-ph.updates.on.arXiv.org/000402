Satellite galaxies in groups and clusters are more likely to have low star formation rates (SFR)
and lie on the red-sequence than central (field) galaxies. Using galaxy group/cluster catalogs
from SDSS DR7, together with a cosmological N-body simulation to track satellite orbits, we examine
the star formation histories and quenching timescales of satellites of M_star > 5 x 10^9 M_sun
at z=0. We first explore satellite infall histories: group preprocessing and ejected orbits are
critical aspects of satellite evolution, and properly accounting for these, satellite infall
typically occurred at z~0.5, or ~5 Gyr ago. To obtain accurate initial conditions for the SFRs of
satellites at their time of first infall, we construct an empirical parametrization for the evolution
of central galaxy SFRs and quiescent fractions. With this, we constrain the importance and efficiency
of satellite quenching as a function of satellite and host halo mass, finding that satellite quenching
is the dominant process for building up all quiescent galaxies at M_star < 10^10 M_sun. We then
constrain satellite star formation histories, finding a 'delayed-then-rapid' quenching scenario:
satellite SFRs evolve unaffected for 2-4 Gyr after infall, after which star formation quenches
rapidly, with an e-folding time of < 0.8 Gyr. These quenching timescales are shorter for more
massive satellites but do not depend on host halo mass: the observed increase in satellite quiescent
fraction with halo mass arises simply because of satellites quenching in a lower mass group prior
to infall (group preprocessing), which is responsible for up to half of quenched satellites in massive
clusters. Because of the long time delay before quenching starts, satellites experience significant
stellar mass growth after infall, nearly identical to central galaxies. This fact provides key
physical insight into the subhalo abundance matching method.
