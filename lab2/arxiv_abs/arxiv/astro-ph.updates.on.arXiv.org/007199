We report the results provided by the XMM-Newton observation of the X-ray binary pulsar SXP59.0
during its most recent outburst in April 2017. The source was detected at $f_{\rm X}$(0.2-12 keV)
= 8$\times 10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, one of its highest flux levels reported to date. The
measured pulse period was $P_{\rm spin}$ = 58.949(1) s, very similar to the periods measured in most
of the previous observations. The pulsed emission was clearly detected over the whole energy range
between 0.2 and 12 keV, but the pulse profile is energy dependent and the pulsed fraction increases
as the energy increases. Although the time-averaged EPIC spectrum is dominated by a power-law component
(with photon index $\Gamma = 0.76 \pm 0.01$), the data show an evident soft excess, which can be described
with the sum of a black-body and a hot thermal plasma component (with temperatures $kT_{\rm BB} =
171^{+11}_{-14}$ eV and $kT_{\rm APEC} = 1.09^{+0.16}_{-0.09}$ keV, respectively). Moreover,
the EPIC and RGS spectra show narrow emission lines due to N, O, Ne, Mg, and Fe. The phase-resolved
spectral analysis of the EPIC data shows that the flux of the black-body component varies with the
pulse phase, while the plasma component is almost constant. We show that the black-body component
can be attributed to the reprocessing of the primary emission by the optically thick material at
the inner edge of the accretion disc, while the hot plasma component is due to a diffuse gas far from
the accretion region and the narrow emission lines of the RGS spectrum are most probably due to photoionized
matter around the accreting source.
