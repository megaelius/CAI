Drift pairs are an unusual type of fine structure sometimes observed in dynamic spectra of solar
radio emission. They appear as two identical short narrowband drifting stripes separated in time;
both positive and negative frequency drifts are observed. Using the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR),
we report unique observations of a cluster of drift pair bursts in the frequency range of 30-70 MHz
made on 12 July 2017. Spectral imaging capabilities of the instrument have allowed us for the first
time to resolve the temporal and frequency evolution of the source locations and sizes at a fixed
frequency and along the drifting pair components. Sources of two components of a drift pair have
been imaged and found to propagate in the same direction along nearly the same trajectories. Motion
of the second component source is delayed in time with respect to that of the first one. The source
trajectories can be complicated and non-radial; positive and negative frequency drifts correspond
to opposite propagation directions. The drift pair bursts with positive and negative frequency
drifts, as well as the associated broadband type-III-like bursts, are produced in the same regions.
The visible source velocities are variable from zero to a few $10^4$ (up to ${\sim 10^5}$) km/s, which
often exceeds the velocities inferred from the drift rate ($\sim 10^4$ km/s). The visible source
sizes are of about $10'-18'$; they are more compact than typical type III sources at the same frequencies.
The existing models of drift pair bursts cannot adequately explain the observed features. We discuss
the key issues that need to be addressed, and in particular the anisotropic scattering of the radio
waves. The broadband bursts observed simultaneously with the drift pairs differ in some aspects
from common type III bursts and may represent a separate type of emission.
