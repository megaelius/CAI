The ratio in number between unobscured (type 1) and obscured (type 2) AGNs is often used to explore
the structure of the torus in the unified scheme for active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Oh et al. (2015)
investigated the type 1 AGN fraction on two-dimensional space in terms of black hole mass ($M_{\rm
BH}$) and bolometric luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}$) and found that the fraction changes depending
on both $M_{\rm BH}$ and $L_{\rm bol}$, forming a ridge-shaped distribution. In this study, based
on the up-to-date type 1 AGN catalog of Oh et al. (2015), we examine how the trend of the type 1 AGN fraction
in the $M_{\rm BH}-L_{\rm bol}$ plane is affected by the different methods used to derive $M_{\rm
BH}$ and $L_{\rm bol}$, and suggest an analytic model to explain the observations. We use galaxies
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 in the redshift range of $0.01 \leq z \leq 0.2$. In
estimating $L_{\rm bol}$, we employ two different methods using [O III] and/or [O I] emission lines,
and find that the $L_{\rm bol}$ values obtained from the two methods agree well. We consider the $M_{\rm
BH}-\sigma_*$ relation, the $M_{\rm BH}-L_{\rm bulge}$ relation and the single-epoch H$\alpha$-based
$M_{\rm BH}$ estimate in calculating $M_{\rm BH}$. We find that the trends of the type 1 AGN fraction
with respect to $M_{\rm BH}$ and $L_{\rm bol}$ are similar for the different derivation methods
for $L_{\rm bol}$ but different when using different methods to derive $M_{\rm BH}$. We present
a model based on the clumpy-torus scheme that reproduces the ridge-shaped distribution of the fraction
parallel to the iso-Eddington ratio lines.
