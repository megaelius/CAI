We present multiwavelength studies of a transient X-ray source, XMMSL1 J131952.3+225958, associated
with the galaxy NGC 5092 at $z=0.023$ detected in the XMM-Newton SLew survey (XMMSL). The source
brightened in the 0.2--2 keV band by a factor of $>20$ in 2005 as compared with previous flux limits
and then faded by a factor of $>200$ as observed with it XMM-Newton in 2013 and with it Swift in 2018.
At the flaring state, the X-ray spectrum can be modeled with a blackbody at a temperature of $\sim$
60 eV and an overall luminosity of $\sim$ $1.5 \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. A UV flare and optical
flare were also detected with the Galaxy Evolution Explorer and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, respectively,
within several months of the X-ray flare, whose nonstellar UV--optical spectrum can be described
with a blackbody at a temperature of $\sim$ $(1-2) \times 10^4$ K and a luminosity of $\sim$ $(2-6)
\times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Interestingly, mid-infrared monitoring observations of NGC 5092
with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer 5--13 yr later show a continuous flux decline. These
dramatic variability properties, from the X-ray through UV and optical to infrared, appear to be
orderly, suggestive of a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE) by a massive black hole, confirming
the postulation by Kanner et al.(2013). This TDE candidate belongs to a rare sample with contemporaneous
bright emission detected in the X-ray, UV, and optical, which are later echoed by dust-reprocessed
light in the mid-infrared. The black hole has a mass of $\sim$ $5 \times 10^{7} \rm M_{\odot}$, residing
in a galaxy that is dominated by a middle-aged stellar population of 2.5 Gyr.
