Measuring Venus' atmospheric circulation at different altitudes is important for understanding
its complex dynamics, in particular the mechanisms driving the super-rotation. Observationally,
Doppler imaging spectroscopy is in principle be the most reliable way to measure wind speeds of planetary
atmospheres because it directly provides the projected speed of atmospheric particles. However,
high-resolution imaging-spectroscopy is challenging, especially in the visible domain, and
most of the knowledge about atmospheric dynamics has been obtained with cloud-tracking technique.
The objective of the present work is to measure the global properties of Venus' atmospheric dynamics
at the altitude of the uppermost clouds, which is probed by reflected solar lines in the visible domain.
Our results are based on high-resolution spectroscopic observations with the long slit spectrometer
of the solar telescope THEMIS. We present the first instantaneous "radial-velocity snapshot"
of any planet of the solar system in the visible domain, i.e., a complete RV map of the planet obtained
by stacking data on less than 10% of its rotation period. From this, we measure the properties of the
zonal and meridional winds, which we unambiguously detect. We identify a wind circulation pattern
that significantly differs from previous knowledge about Venus. The zonal wind displays a "hot
spot" structure, featuring about 200 m/s at sunrise and 70 m/s at noon in the equatorial region. Regarding
meridional winds, we detect an equator-to-pole meridional flow peaking at 45 m/s at mid latitudes,
i.e., which is about twice as large as what was reported so far.
