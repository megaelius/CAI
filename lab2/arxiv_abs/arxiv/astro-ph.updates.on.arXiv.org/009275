In this paper, we aim to characterize a transiting planetary candidate in the southern skies found
in the combined MASCARA and bRing data sets of HD 85628, an A3V star of V = 8.2 mag at a distance 172 pc,
to confirm its planetary nature. The candidate was originally detected in data obtained jointly
with the MASCARA and bRing instruments using a BLS search for transit events. Further photometry
was taken by the 0.7 m CHAT, and radial velocity measurements with FIDEOS on the ESO 1.0 m Telescope.
High resolution spectra during a transit were taken with CHIRON on the SMARTS 1.5 m telescope to target
the Doppler shadow of the candidate. We confirm the existence of a hot Jupiter transiting the bright
A3V star HD 85628, which we co-designate as MASCARA-4b and bRing-1b. It is in a 2.824 day orbit, with
an estimated planet radius of $1.53 ^{0.07}_{0.04}$ $R_{\rm{Jup}}$ and an estimated planet mass
of $3.1 \pm 0.9$ $M_{\rm{Jup}}$, putting it well within the planet mass regime.. The CHAT observations
show a partial transit, reducing the probability that the transit was around a faint background
star. The CHIRON observations show a clear Doppler shadow, implying that the transiting object
is in a retrograde orbit with $|\lambda| = 247.5 \pm 1.6 $\textdegree. The planet orbits at at a distance
of 0.047 $\pm$ 0.004 AU from the star and has a zero-albedo equilibrium temperature of 2100 $\pm$
100 K. In addition, we find that HD 85628 has a previously unreported stellar companion star in the
Gaia DR2 data demonstrating common proper motion and parallax at 4.3 arcsecond separation (projected
separation $\sim$740 AU), and with absolute magnitude consistent with being a K/M dwarf.
