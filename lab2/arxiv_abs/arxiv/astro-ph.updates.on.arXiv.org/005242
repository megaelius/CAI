NGC 5548 has been intensively monitored by the AGN Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping
collaboration. Approximately after half of the light curves, the correlation between the broad
emission lines and the lag-corrected ultraviolet continua becomes weak. This anomalous behavior
is accompanied by an increase of soft X-ray emission. We propose a simple model to understand this
anomalous behavior, i.e., the corona might fall down, thereby increasing the covering fraction
of the inner disk. Therefore, X-ray and extreme ultraviolet emission suffer from spectral variations.
The ultraviolet continua variations are driven by both X-ray and extreme ultraviolet variations.
Consequently, the spectral variability induced by the falling corona would dilute the correlation
between the broad emission lines and the ultraviolet continua. Our model can explain many additional
observational facts, including the dependence of the anomalous behavior on velocity and ionization
energy. We also show that the time lag and correlation between the X-ray and the ultraviolet variations
change as NGC 5548 displays the anomalous behavior. The time lag is dramatically longer than the
expectation from disk reprocessing if the anomalous behavior is properly excluded. During the
anomalous state, the time lag approaches the light-travel timescale of disk reprocessing albeit
with a much weaker correlation. We speculate that the time lag in the normal state is caused by reprocessing
of the broad line region gas. As NGC 5548 enters the abnormal state, the contribution of the broad
line region gas is smaller; the time lag reflects disk reprocessing. We also discuss alternative
scenarios.
