We propose to infer ionising continuum leaking properties of galaxies by looking at their Lyman-alpha
line profiles. We carry out Lyman-alpha radiation transfer calculations in two models of HII regions
which are porous to ionising continuum escape: 1) the so-called "density bounded" media, in which
massive stars produce enough ionising photons to keep the surrounding interstellar medium transparent
to the ionising continuum, i.e almost totally ionised, and 2) "riddled ionisation-bounded" media,
surrounded by neutral interstellar medium, but with holes, i.e. with a covering factor lower than
unity. The Lyman-alpha spectra emergent from these configurations have distinctive features:
1) a "classical" asymmetric redshifted profile in the first case, but with a small shift of the maximum
of the profile compare to the systemic redshift (Vpeak < 150 km/s); 2) a main peak at the systemic
redshift in the second case (Vpeak = 0 km/s), with, as a consequence, a non-zero Lyman-alpha flux
bluewards the systemic redshift. Assuming that in a galaxy leaking ionising photons, the Lyman-alpha
component emerging from the leaking star cluster(s) dominates the total Lyman-alpha spectrum,
the Lyman-alpha shape may be used as a pre-selection tool to detect Lyman continuum (LyC) leaking
galaxies, in objects with well determined systemic redshift, and high spectral resolution Lyman-alpha
spectra (R >= 4000). The examination of a sample of 10 local starbursts with high resolution HST-COS
Lyman-alpha spectra and known in the literature as LyC leakers or leaking candidates, corroborates
our predictions. Observations of Lyman-alpha profiles at high resolution should show definite
signatures betraying the escape of Lyman continuum photons from star-forming galaxies.
