We study the effects of radio jets on galaxies in their vicinity (satellites) and the role of satellites
in triggering radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The study compares the aggregate properties
of satellites of a sample of 7,220 radio AGNs at z < 0.3 (identified by Best & Heckman 2012 from
the SDSS and NVSS+FIRST surveys) to the satellites of a control sample of radio-quiet galaxies,
which are matched in redshift, color, luminosity, and axis ratio, as well as by environment type:
field galaxies, cluster members and brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). Remarkably, we find that
radio AGNs exhibit on average a 50% excess (17{\sigma} significance) in the number of satellites
within 100 kpc even though the cluster membership was controlled for (e.g., radio BCGs have more
satellites than radio-quiet BCGs, etc.). Satellite excess is not confirmed for high-excitation
sources, which are only 2% of radio AGN. Extra satellites may be responsible for raising the probability
for hot gas AGN accretion via tidal effects or may otherwise enhance the intensity or duration of
the radio-emitting phase. Furthermore, we find that the incidence of radio AGNs among potential
hosts (massive ellipticals) is similar for field galaxies and for non-BCG cluster members, suggesting
that AGN fueling depends primarily on conditions in the host halo rather than the parent, cluster
halo. Regarding feedback, we find that radio AGNs, either high or low excitation, have no detectable
effect on star formation in their satellites, as neither induced star formation nor star formation
quenching is present in more than ~1% of radio AGN.
