The Thomas-Fermi approach to galaxy structure determines selfconsistently and nonlinearly the
gravitational potential of the fermionic WDM particles given their quantum distribution function
f(E). Galaxy magnitudes as the halo radius r_h, mass M_h, velocity dispersion and phase space density
are obtained. We derive the general equation of state for galaxies (relation between the pressure
and the density), and provide an analytic expression. This clearly exhibits two regimes: (i) Large
diluted galaxies for M_h > 2.3 10^6 Msun corresponding to temperatures T_0 > 0.017 K, described
by the classical self gravitating WDM Boltzman regime and (ii) Compact dwarf galaxies for 1.6 10^6
Msun > M_h>M_{h,min}=30000 (2keV/m)^{16/5} Msun, T_0<0.011 K described by the quantum
fermionic WDM regime. The T_0=0 degenerate quantum limit predicts the most compact and smallest
galaxy (minimal radius and mass M_{h,min}). All magnitudes in the diluted regime exhibit square
root of M_h scaling laws and are universal functions of r/r_h when normalized to their values at the
origin or at r_h. We find that universality in galaxies (for M_h > 10^6 Msun) reflects the WDM perfect
gas behaviour. These theoretical results contrasted to robust and independent sets of galaxy data
remarkably reproduce the observations. For the small galaxies, 10^6>M_h>M_{h,min} corresponding
to effective temperatures T_0 < 0.017 K, the equation of state is galaxy dependent and the profiles
are no more universal. These non-universal properties in small galaxies account to the quantum
physics of the WDM fermions in the compact regime. Our results are independent of any WDM particle
physics model, they only follow from the gravitational interaction of the WDM particles and their
fermionic quantum nature.
