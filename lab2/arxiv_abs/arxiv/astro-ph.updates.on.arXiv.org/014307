In an effort to probe the origin of surface brightness profile (SBP) breaks widely observed in nearby
disk galaxies, we carry out a comparative study of stellar population profiles of 635 disk galaxies
selected from the MaNGA spectroscopic survey. We classify our galaxies into single exponential
(TI), down-bending (TII) and up-bending (TIII) SBP types, and derive their spin parameters and
radial profiles of age/metallicity-sensitive spectral features. Most TII (TIII) galaxies have
down-bending (up-bending) star formation rate (SFR) radial profiles, implying that abrupt radial
changes of SFR intensities contribute to the formation of both TII and TIII breaks. Nevertheless,
a comparison between our galaxies and simulations suggests that stellar migration plays a significant
role in weakening down-bending $\Sigma_{\star}$ profile breaks. While there is a correlation
between the break strengths of SBPs and age/metallicity-sensitive spectral features for TII galaxies,
no such correlation is found for TIII galaxies, indicating that stellar migration may not play a
major role in shaping TIII breaks, as is evidenced by a good correspondence between break strengths
of $\Sigma_{\star}$ and surface brightness profiles of TIII galaxies. We do not find evidence for
galaxy spin being a relevant parameter for forming different SBP types, nor do we find significant
differences between the asymmetries of galaxies with different SBP types, suggesting that environmental
disturbances or satellite accretion in the recent past do not significantly influence the break
formation. By dividing our sample into early and late morphological types, we find that galaxies
with different SBP types follow nearly the same tight stellar mass-$R_{25}$ relation, which makes
the hypothesis that stellar migration alone can transform SBP types from TII to TI and then to TIII
highly unlikely.
