We present $\sim$0.1" resolution ($\sim$10 pc) ALMA observations of a molecular cloud identified
in the merging Antennae galaxies with the potential to form a globular cluster, nicknamed the ``Firecracker.'
Since star formation has not yet begun at an appreciable level, this cloud provides an example of
what the birth environment of a globular cluster may have looked like before stars form and disrupt
the natal conditions. Using emission from $^{12}$CO(2-1), $^{12}$CO(3-2), $^{13}$CO(2-1),
HCN(4-3), and HCO$^+$(4-3), we are able to resolve the cloud's structure and find that it has a characteristic
radius of 22 pc and a mass of 1--9$\times10^6 M_\odot$. We also constrain the abundance ratios of
$^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO and H$_2$/\twelveCO. Based on the calculated mass, we determine that the
commonly used CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor varies spatially, with average values in the range
$X_{CO}=(0.12-1.1)\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$. We demonstrate that if
the cloud is bound (as is circumstantially suggested by its bright, compact morphology), an external
pressure of $P/k > 10^8$ K cm$^{-3}$ is required. This would be consistent with theoretical expectations
that globular cluster formation requires high pressure environments. The position-velocity
diagram of the cloud and its surrounding material suggests that this pressure may be produced by
the collision of filaments. The radial profile of the column density can be fit with both a Gaussian
and Bonnor-Ebert profile. The relative line strengths of HCN and HCO$^+$ in this region suggest
that these molecular lines can be used as tracers for the evolutionary stage of a cluster.
