We propose a long-term strategy for detecting thermal neutrinos from the remnant of binary-neutron-star
mergers with a future M-ton water-Cherenkov detector such as Hyper-Kamiokande. Monitoring >~2500
mergers within <~200 Mpc, we may be able to detect a single neutrino with a human-time-scale operation
of ~80 Mt years for the merger rate of 1 Mpc^{-3} Myr^{-1}, which is slightly lower than the median
value derived by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration with GW170817. Although the number of neutrino events
is minimal, contamination from other sources of neutrinos can be reduced efficiently to ~0.03 by
analyzing only ~1 s after each merger identified with gravitational-wave detectors if Gadolinium
is dissolved in the water. The contamination may be reduced further to ~0.01 if we allow the increase
of waiting time by a factor of ~1.7. The detection of even a single neutrino can pin down the energy
scale of thermal neutrino emission from binary-neutron-star mergers and could strongly support
or disfavor formation of remnant massive neutron stars. Because the dispersion relation of gravitational
waves are now securely constrained to that of massless particles with a corresponding limit on the
graviton mass of <~10^{-22} eV/c^2 by binary-black-hole mergers, the time delay of a neutrino from
gravitational waves can be used to put an upper limit of <~O(10) meV/c^2 on the absolute neutrino
mass in the lightest eigenstate. Large neutrino detectors will enhance the detectability, and
in particular, 5 Mt Deep-TITAND and 10 Mt MICA planned in the future will allow us to detect thermal
neutrinos every ~16 and 8 years, respectively, increasing the significance.
