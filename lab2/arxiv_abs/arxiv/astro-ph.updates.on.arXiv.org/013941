We investigate the evolution of superclusters and supercluster cocoons (basins of attraction),
and the influence of cosmological parameters to the evolution. We perform numerical simulations
of the evolution of the cosmic web for different cosmological models: the LCDM model with a conventional
value of the dark energy (DE) density, the open model OCDM with no DE, the standard SCDM model with
no DE, and the Hyper-DE HCDM model with an enhanced DE density value. We find ensembles of superclusters
of these models for five evolutionary stages, corresponding to the present epoch z = 0, and to redshifts
z = 1, 3, 10, 30. We use diameters of the largest superclusters and the number of superclusters as percolation
functions to describe properties of the ensemble of superclusters in the cosmic web. We analyse
the size and mass distribution of superclusters in models and in real Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
based samples. In all models numbers and volumes of supercluster cocoons are independent on cosmological
epochs. Supercluster masses increase with time, and geometrical sizes in comoving coordinates
decrease with time, for all models. LCDM, OCDM and HCDM models have almost similar percolation parameters.
This suggests that the essential parameter, which defines the evolution of superclusters, is the
matter density. The DE density influences the growth of the amplitude of density perturbations,
and the growth of masses of superclusters, albeit significantly less strongly. The HCDM model has
the largest speed of the growth of the amplitude of density fluctuations, and the largest growth
of supercluster masses during the evolution. Geometrical diameters and numbers of HCDM superclusters
at high threshold densities are larger than for LCDM and OCDM superclusters. SCDM model has about
two times more superclusters than other models; SCDM superclusters have smaller diameters and
masses.
