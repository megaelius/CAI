Recent simulation studies suggest that the supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth in the early universe
may precede the prolonged intense star formation within its host galaxy, instead of quasars appearing
after the obscured dusty star formation phase. If so, high-redshift quasars with low Eddington
ratios ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$) would be found in actively star-forming hosts with a star formation
rate (SFR) of $>100~M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We present the sub-mm observations of IMS J2204+0112,
a faint quasar with a quasar bolometric luminosity of $L_{\rm bol}=4.2\times10^{12}~L_{\odot}$
and a low $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ of only 0.1 at $z\sim6$, carried out with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA). From its sub-mm fluxes, we measure the rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) luminosity
of $L_{\rm FIR}=(3$--$4)\times10^{12}~L_{\odot}$. Interestingly, the derived host galaxy's
SFR is $\sim500$--$700~M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, an order of magnitude higher than those of the $L_{\rm
bol}$-matched $z\gtrsim6$ quasars with high $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$. Similar FIR excesses are also
found for five $z\gtrsim6$ low-$\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ quasars ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}<0.2$) in the
literature. We show that the overall SFR, $M_{\rm BH}$, and $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ distributions
of these and other sub-mm-detected quasars at $z\gtrsim6$ can be explained with the evolutionary
track of high-redshift quasars in a simulation study where low $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ and high SFR
quasars are expected at the end of the SMBH growth. This suggests that the nuclear activities of the
low $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$, high $L_{\rm FIR}$ quasars are on the brink of being turned off, while their
host galaxies continue to form the bulk of their stars at SFR $>100~M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.
