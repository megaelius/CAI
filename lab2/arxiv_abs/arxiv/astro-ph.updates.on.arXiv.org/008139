We present the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey (MaDCoWS), a search for galaxy clusters
at 0.7<z<1.5 based upon data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission. MaDCoWS
is the first cluster survey capable of discovering massive clusters at these redshifts over the
full extragalactic sky. The search is divided into two regions -- the region of the extragalactic
sky covered by Pan-STARRS (Dec>-30 degrees) and the remainder of the southern extragalactic sky
at Dec<-30 degrees for which shallower optical data from SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey are available.
In this paper we describe the search algorithm, characterize the sample, and present the first MaDCoWS
data release -- catalogs of the 2433 highest amplitude detections in the WISE--Pan-STARRS region
and the 250 highest amplitude detections in the WISE--SuperCOSMOS region. A total of 1723 of the
detections from the WISE--Pan-STARRS sample have also been observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope,
providing photometric redshifts and richnesses, and an additional 64 detections within the WISE--SuperCOSMOS
region also have photometric redshifts and richnesses. Spectroscopic redshifts for 38 MaDCoWS
clusters with IRAC photometry demonstrate that the photometric redshifts have an uncertainty
of $\sigma_z/(1+z)\sim0.036$. Combining the richness measurements with Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
observations of MaDCoWS clusters, we also present a preliminary mass-richness relation that can
be used to infer the approximate mass distribution of the full sample. The estimated median mass
for the WISE--Pan-STARRS catalog is $M_{500}=1.6^{+0.7}_{-0.8}\times10^{14} \mathrm{M}_\odot$,
with the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich data confirming that we detect clusters with masses up to $M_{500}\sim5\times10^{14}
\mathrm{M}_\odot$ $(M_{200}\sim10^{15} \mathrm{M}_\odot)$.
