High-resolution Doppler spectroscopy has been used to detect several chemical species in exoplanetary
atmospheres. Such detections have traditionally relied on cross correlation of observed spectra
against spectral model templates, an approach that is successful for detecting chemical species
but not optimised for constraining abundances. Recent work has explored ways to perform atmospheric
retrievals on high-resolution spectra (HRS) and combine them with retrievals routinely performed
for low-resolution spectra (LRS) by developing a mapping from the cross correlation function to
a likelihood metric. We build upon previous studies and report HyDRA-H, a hybrid retrieval code
for simultaneous analysis of low- and high- resolution thermal emission spectra of exoplanets
in a fully Bayesian approach. We demonstrate HyDRA-H on the hot Jupiter HD 209458b as a case study.
We validate our HRS retrieval capability by confirming previous results and report a simultaneous
hybrid retrieval using both HRS and LRS data. The LRS data span the HST WFC3 (1.1-1.7 $\mu$m) and Spitzer
photometry (IRAC 3.6-8 $\mu$m) bands, while the HRS data were obtained with CRIRES on VLT at 2.3 $\mu$m.
The constraints on the composition and temperature profiles for the hybrid retrieval are more stringent
than retrievals with either LRS or HRS datasets individually. We retrieve abundances of $\log(\mathrm{H_2O)}
= -4.11^{+0.91}_{-0.30}$ and $\log(\mathrm{CO}) = {-2.16}^{+0.99}_{-0.47}$, and $\mathrm{C/O}
= 0.99^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$, consistent with previous works. We constrain the photospheric temperature
to be $1498^{+216}_{-57}$ K, consistent with the equilibrium temperature. Our results demonstrate
the significant advantages of hybrid retrievals by combining strengths of both HRS and LRS observations
which probe complementary aspects of exoplanetary atmospheres.
