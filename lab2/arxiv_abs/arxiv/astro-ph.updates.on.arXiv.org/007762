Recent numerical studies revealed that transverse motions of coronal loops can induce the Kelvin-Helmholtz
Instability (KHI). This process could be important in coronal heating because it leads to dissipation
of energy at small spatial-scale plasma interactions. Meanwhile, small amplitude decayless oscillations
in coronal loops have been discovered recently in observations of SDO/AIA. We model such oscillations
in coronal loops and study wave heating effects, considering a kink and Alfv{\'e}n driver separately
and a mixed driver at the bottom of flux tubes. Both the transverse and Alfv{\'e}n oscillations can
lead to the KHI. Meanwhile, the Alfv{\'e}n oscillations established in loops will experience phase
mixing. Both processes will generate small spatial-scale structures, which can help the dissipation
of wave energy. Indeed, we observe the increase of internal energy and temperature in loop regions.
The heating is more pronounced for the simulation containing the mixed kink and Alfv{\'e}n driver.
This means that the mixed wave modes can lead to a more efficient energy dissipation in the turbulent
state of the plasma and that the KHI eddies act as an agent to dissipate energy in other wave modes.
Furthermore, we also obtained forward modelling results using the FoMo code. We obtained forward
models which are very similar to the observations of decayless oscillations. Due to the limited
resolution of instruments, neither Alfv{\'e}n modes nor the fine structures are observable. Therefore,
this numerical study shows that Alfv{\'e}n modes probably can co-exist with kink modes, leading
to enhanced heating.
