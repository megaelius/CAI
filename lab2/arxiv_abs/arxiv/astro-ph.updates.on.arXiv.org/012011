The gravity field of a giant planet is typically our best window into its interior structure and composition.
Through comparison of a model planet's calculated gravitational potential with the observed potential,
inferences can be made about interior quantities, including possible composition and the existence
of a core. Necessarily, a host of assumptions go into such calculations, making every inference
about a giant planet's structure strongly model dependent. In this work we present a more general
picture by setting Saturn's gravity field, as measured during the \emph{Cassini} Grand Finale,
as a likelihood function driving a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo exploration of the possible interior
density profiles. The result is a posterior distribution of the interior structure that is not tied
to assumed composition, thermal state, or material equations of state. Constraints on interior
structure derived in this Bayesian framework are necessarily less informative, but are also less
biased and more general. These empirical and probabilistic constraints on the density structure
are our main data product which we archive for continued analysis. We find that the outer half of Saturn's
radius is relatively well constrained, and we interpret our findings as suggesting a significant
metal enrichment, in line with atmospheric abundances from remote sensing. As expected, the inner
half of Saturn's radius is less well-constrained by gravity, but we generally find solutions that
include a significant density enhancement, which can be interpreted as a core, although this core
is often lower in density and larger in radial extent than typically found by standard models. This
is consistent with a dilute core and/or composition gradients.
