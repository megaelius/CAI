We study a stochastic variability of SS433 in the $10^{-4} - 5\times 10^{-2}$ Hz frequency range
based on RXTE data, and on simultaneous observations with RXTE and optical telescopes. We find that
the cross-correlation functions and power spectra depend drastically on the precession phase
of the supercritical accretion disc. When the wind funnel of the disc is maximally open to the observer,
a flat part emerges in the power spectrum; a break is observed at the frequency $1.7\times10^{-3}$
Hz, with a power-law index $\beta \approx 1.67$ at higher frequencies. The soft emission forming
mostly in the jets, lags behind the hard and optical emission. When the observer does not see the funnel
and jets (the `edge-on' disc), the power spectrum is described by a single power-law with $\beta
\approx 1.34$ and no correlations between X-ray ranges are detected. We investigated two mechanisms
to explain the observed variability at the open disc phase, 1) reflection of radiation at the funnel
wall (X-rays and optical) and 2) the gas cooling in the jets (X-rays only). The X-ray variability
is determined by the contribution of both mechanisms, however the contribution of the jets is much
higher. We found that the funnel size is $(2-2.5)\times10^{12}$ cm, and the opening angle is $\vartheta_f\sim
50^\circ$. X-ray jets may consist of three fractions with different densities: $8\times10^{13}$,
$3\times10^{13}$ and $5\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$, with most of the jet's mass falling within the
latter fraction. We suppose that revealed flat part in the power spectrum may be related to an abrupt
change in the disc structure and viscous time-scale at the spherization radius, because the accretion
disc becomes thick at this radius, $h/r \sim 1$. The extent of the flat spectrum depends on the variation
of viscosity at the spherization radius.
