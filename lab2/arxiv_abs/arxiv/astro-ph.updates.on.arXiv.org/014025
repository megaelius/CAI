Context: Hot coronal jets are a basic observed feature of the solar atmosphere whose physical origin
is still being actively debated. Aims: We study six recurrent jets occurring in the active region
NOAA 12644 on April 04, 2017. They are observed in all the hot filters of AIA as well as cool surges in
IRIS slit-jaw high spatial and temporal resolution images. Methods: The AIA filters allow us to
study the temperature and the emission measure of the jets using the filter ratio method. We study
the pre-jet phases by analyzing the intensity oscillations at the base of the jets with the wavelet
technique. Results: A fine co-alignment of the AIA and IRIS data shows that the jets are initiated
at the top of a canopy-like, double-chambered structure with cool emission on one side and hot emission
in the other. The hot jets are collimated in the hot temperature filters, have high velocities (around
250 km/s) and accompanied by the cool surges and ejected kernels both moving at about 45 km/s. In the
pre-phase of the jets, at their base we find quasi-periodic intensity oscillations in phase with
small ejections; they have a period between 2 and 6 minutes and are reminiscent of acoustic or MHD
waves. Conclusions: This series of jets and surges provides a good case-study to test the 2D and 3D
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models that result from magnetic flux emergence. The double-chambered
structure found in the observations corresponds to the cold and hot loop regions found in the models
beneath the current sheet that contains the reconnection site. The cool surge with kernels is comparable
with the cool ejection and plasmoids that naturally appear in the models.
