Abridged. Are all filaments bundles of fibers? To address this question, we have investigated the
gas organization within the paradigmatic Integral Shape Filament (ISF). We combined two new ALMA
Cycle 3 mosaics with previous IRAM 30m observations to produce a high-dynamic range N$_2$H$^+$(1-0)
emission map of the ISF tracing its high-density material and velocity structure down to scales
of 0.009 pc. From the analysis of the gas kinematics, we identify a total of 55 dense fibers in the central
region of the ISF. Independently of their location, these fibers are characterized by transonic
internal motions, lengths of ~0.15 pc, and masses per-unit-length close to those expected in hydrostatic
equilibrium. The ISF fibers are spatially organized forming a dense bundle with multiple hub-like
associations likely shaped by the local gravitational potential. Within this complex network,
the ISF fibers show a compact radial emission profile with a median FWHM of 0.035 pc systematically
narrower than the previously proposed universal 0.1 pc filament width. Our ALMA observations reveal
complex bundles of fibers in the ISF, suggesting strong similarities between the internal substructure
of this massive filament and previously studied lower-mass objects. The fibers show identical
dynamic properties in both low- and high-mass regions, and their widespread detection suggests
a preferred organizational mechanism of gas in which the physical fiber dimensions (width and length)
are self-regulated depending on their intrinsic gas density. Combined with previous works, we
identify a systematic increase of the surface density of fibers as a function of the total mass per-unit-length
in filamentary clouds. Based on this empirical correlation, we propose a unified star-formation
scenario where the observed differences between low- and high-mass clouds emerge naturally from
the initial concentration of fibers.
