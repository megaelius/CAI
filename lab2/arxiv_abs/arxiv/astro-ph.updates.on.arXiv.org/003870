The fully nonlinear gravitationally induced trajectories of a nearly complete set of galaxies,
groups, and clusters in the Local Supercluster are constructed in a Numerical Action Method (NAM)
model constrained by data from the CosmicFlows survey and various distance indicators. We add the
gravity field due to inhomogeneities external to the sample sphere by making use of larger scale
peculiar flow measurements. Assignments of total masses were made to find the best overall set of
mutual attractions, as determined by a goodness criterion based on present day radial velocities,
individually for the Virgo Cluster, M31, and the Milky Way (MW), and via a mass-to-light ratio relationship
for other masses. The low median chi-square found indicates the model fits the present day velocity
flow well, but a slightly high mean chi-square may indicate that some masses underwent complex orbits.
The best fit, when setting the value of $H_0$ to the CosmicFlows value of 75 km/s/Mpc and the WMAP value
for $\Omega_m=0.244$ consistent with that $H_0$, occurs with the following parameters: $\Omega_{orphan}
= 0.077\pm0.016$, $M/L_K $= $40 \pm 2$ $L_{10}^{0.15}$ $M_\odot/L_\odot$ ($L_{10}$ is K-band
luminosity in units of $10^{10} L_\odot$), a Virgo mass of $6.3\pm0.8 \times 10^{14} M_\odot$ ($M/L_K
= 113\pm15 M_\odot/L_\odot$), and a mass for the MW plus M31 of $5.15\pm0.35 \times 10^{12} M_\odot$.
The best constant mass-to-light ratio is $M/L_K = 58\pm3 M_\odot/L_\odot$. The Virgocentric turnaround
radius is $7.3\pm0.3$ Mpc. We explain several interesting trends in peculiar motions for various
regions now that we can construct the 3D orbital histories.
