Aims. The process of gravitational fragmentation in the L1482 molecular filament of the California
Molecular Cloud is studied by combining several complementary observations and physical estimates.
We investigate the kinematic and dynamical states of this molecular filament and physical properties
of several dozens of dense molecular clumps embedded therein. Methods. We present and compare molecular
line emission observations of the J=2--1 and J=3--2 transitions of 12CO in this molecular complex,
using the KOSMA 3-meter telescope. These observations are complemented with archival data observations
and analyses of the 13CO J=1--0 emission obtained at the Purple Mountain Observatory 13.7-meter
radio telescope at Delingha Station in QingHai Province of west China, as well as infrared emission
maps from the Herschel Space Telescope online archive, obtained with the SPIRE and PACS cameras.
Comparison of these complementary datasets allow for a comprehensive multi-wavelength analysis
of the L1482 molecular filament. Results. We have identified 23 clumps along the molecular filament
L1482 in the California Molecular Cloud. All these molecular clumps show supersonic non-thermal
gas motions. While surprisingly similar in mass and size to the much more well-known Orion Molecular
Cloud, the formation rate of high-mass stars appears to be suppressed in the California Molecular
Cloud relative to that in the Orion Molecular Cloud based on the mass-radius threshold derived from
the static Bonnor Ebert sphere. Our analysis suggests that these molecular filaments are thermally
supercritical and molecular clumps may form by gravitational fragmentation along the filament.
Instead of being static, these molecular clumps are most likely in processes of dynamic evolution.
