We conduct a stacking analysis using 1.4 GHz NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) detections and Planck all-sky
maps to estimate the differential source counts down to the few 100 $\mu$Jy level at 30, 44, 70 and
100 GHz. Consequently, we are able to measure the integrated extragalactic background light from
discrete sources at these frequencies. By integrating down to a 1.4 GHz flux density of $\approx$2$
\mu$Jy, we measure integrated, extragalactic brightness temperatures from discrete sources
of $105.63\pm10.56 $mK, $21.76\pm3.09 \mu$K, $8.80\pm0.95 \mu$K, $2.59\pm0.27 \mu$K, and $1.15\pm0.10
\mu$k at 1.4, 30, 44, 70, and 100 GHz, respectively. Our measurement at 1.4 GHz is slightly larger
than previous measurements, most likely due to using NVSS data compared to older interferometric
data in the literature, but still remains a factor of $\approx$4.5 below that required to account
for the excess extragalactic sky brightness measured at 1.4 GHz by ARCADE 2. The fit to ARCADE 2 total
extragalactic sky brightness measurements is also a factor of $\approx$8.6, 6.6, 6.2, and 4.9 times
brighter than what we estimate from discrete sources at 30, 44, 70 and 100 GHz, respectively. The
extragalactic sky spectrum (i.e., $T_{\rm b} \propto \nu^{\beta}$) from discrete sources appears
to flatten with increasing frequency, having a spectral index of $\beta=-2.82\pm0.06$ between
1.4 and 30 GHz and $\beta=-2.39\pm0.12$ between 30 and 100 GHz. We believe that the spectral flattening
most likely arises from a combination of Gigahertz-peaked sources and the spectral hardening of
radio-detected sources at higher frequencies, particularly at faint flux densities. However,
the precise origin of a hard component of energetic electrons responsible for the emission remains
unclear.
