We use machine learning to classify galaxies according to their HI content, based on both their optical
photometry and environmental properties. The data used for our analyses are the outputs in the range
$z = 0-1$ from MUFASA cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. In our previous paper, where we predicted
the galaxy HI content using the same input features, HI rich galaxies were only selected for the training.
In order for the predictions on real observation data to be more accurate, the classifiers built
in this study will first establish if a galaxy is HI rich ($\rm{log(M_{HI}/M_{*})} > -2 $) before
estimating its neutral hydrogen content using the regressors developed in the first paper. We resort
to various machine learning algorithms and assess their performance with various metrics such
as accuracy for instance. The performance of the classifiers gets better with increasing redshift
and reaches their peak performance around $z = 1$. Random Forest method, the most robust among the
classifiers when considering only the mock data for both training and test in this study, reaches
an accuracy above $98.6 \%$ at $z = 0$ and above $99.0 \%$ at $z = 1$. We test our algorithms, trained
with simulation data, on classification of the galaxies in RESOLVE, ALFALFA and GASS surveys. Interestingly,
SVM algorithm, the best classifier for the tests, achieves a precision, the relevant metric for
the tests, above $87.60\%$ and a specificity above $71.4\%$ with all the tests, indicating that
the classifier is capable of learning from the simulated data to classify HI rich/HI poor galaxies
from the real observation data. With the advent of large HI 21 cm surveys such as the SKA, this set of
classifiers, together with the regressors developed in the first paper, will be part of a pipeline,
a very useful tool, which is aimed at predicting HI content of galaxies.
