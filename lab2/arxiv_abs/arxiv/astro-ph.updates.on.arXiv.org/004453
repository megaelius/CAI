We make radial measurements of stellar initial mass function (IMF) sensitive absorption features
in the two massive early-type galaxies NGC 1277 and IC 843. Using the Oxford Short Wavelength Integral
Field SpecTrogaph (SWIFT), we obtain resolved measurements of the NaI0.82 and FeH0.99 indices,
among others, finding both galaxies show strong gradients in NaI absorption combined with flat
FeH profiles at $\sim0.4$\AA. We find these measurements may be explained by radial gradients in
the IMF, appropriate abundance gradients in [Na/Fe] and [Fe/H], or a combination of the two, and
our data is unable to break this degeneracy. We also use full spectral fitting to infer global properties
from an integrated spectrum of each object, deriving a unimodal IMF slope consistent with Salpeter
in IC 843 ($x=2.27\pm0.17$) but steeper than Salpeter in NGC 1277 ($x=2.69\pm0.11$), despite their
similar FeH equivalent widths. Independently, we fit the strength of the FeH feature and compare
to the E-MILES and CvD12 stellar population libraries, finding agreement between the models. The
IMF values derived in this way are in close agreement with those from spectral fitting in NGC 1277
($x_{\mathrm{CvD}}=2.59^{+0.25}_{-0.48}$ , $x_{\mathrm{E-MILES}}=2.77\pm0.31$), but are
less consistent in IC 843, with the IMF derived from FeH alone leading to steeper slopes than when
fitting the full spectrum ($x_{\mathrm{CvD}}=2.57^{+0.30}_{-0.41}$, $x_{\mathrm{E-MILES}}=2.72\pm0.25$).
This work highlights the importance of a large wavelength coverage for breaking the degeneracy
between abundance and IMF variations, and may bring into doubt the use of the Wing-Ford band as an
IMF index if used without other spectral information.
