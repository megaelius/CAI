Surface brightness-colour relations (SBCRs) are used to derive the stellar angular diameters
from photometric observations. They have various astrophysical applications, such as the distance
determination of eclipsing binaries or the determination of exoplanet parameters. However, strong
discrepancies between the SBCRs still exist in the literature, in particular for early and late-type
stars. We aim to calibrate new SBCRs as a function of the spectral type and the luminosity class of
the stars. Our goal is also to apply homogeneous criteria to the selection of the reference stars
and in view of compiling an exhaustive and up-to-date list of interferometric late-type targets.
We implemented criteria to select measurements in the JMMC Measured Diameters Catalog (JMDC).
We then applied additional criteria on the photometric measurements used to build the SBCRs, together
with stellar characteristics diagnostics. We built SBCRs for F5/K7-II/III, F5/K7-IV/V, M-II/III
and M-V stars, with respective RMS of $\sigma_{F_{V}} = 0.0022$ mag, $\sigma_{F_{V}} = 0.0044$
mag, $\sigma_{F_{V}} = 0.0046$ mag, and $\sigma_{F_{V}} = 0.0038$ mag. This results in a precision
on the angular diameter of 1.0\%, 2.0\%, 2.1\%, and 1.7\%, respectively. These relations cover
a large $V-K$ colour range of magnitude, from 1 to 7.5. Our work demonstrates that SBCRs are significantly
dependent on the spectral type and the luminosity class of the star. Through a new set of interferometric
measurements, we demonstrate the critical importance of the selection criteria proposed for the
calibration of SBCR. Finally, using the Gaia photometry for our samples, we obtained (G-K) SBCRs
with a precision on the angular diameter between 1.1\% and 2.4\%.
