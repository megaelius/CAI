We carry out a joint analysis of redshift-space distortions and galaxy-galaxy lensing, with the
aim of measuring the growth rate of structure; this is a key quantity for understanding the nature
of gravity on cosmological scales and late-time cosmic acceleration. We make use of the final VIPERS
redshift survey dataset, which maps a portion of the Universe at a redshift of $z \simeq 0.8$, and
the lensing data from the CFHTLenS survey over the same area of the sky. We build a consistent theoretical
model that combines non-linear galaxy biasing and redshift-space distortion models, and confront
it with observations. The two probes are combined in a Bayesian maximum likelihood analysis to determine
the growth rate of structure at two redshifts $z=0.6$ and $z=0.86$. We obtain measurements of $f\sigma_8(0.6)
= 0.48 \pm 0.12$ and $f\sigma_8(0.86) = 0.48 \pm 0.10$. The additional galaxy-galaxylensing constraint
alleviates galaxy bias and $\sigma_8$ degeneracies, providing direct measurements of $[f(0.6),\sigma_8(0.6)]
= [0.93 \pm 0.22, 0.52 \pm 0.06]$ and $f(0.86),\sigma_8(0.86)] = [0.99 \pm 0.19, 0.48 \pm 0.04]$.
These measurements are statistically consistent with a Universe where the gravitational interactions
can be described by General Relativity, although they are not yet accurate enough to rule out some
commonly considered alternatives. Finally, as a complementary test we measure the gravitational
slip parameter, $E_G$ , for the first time at $z>0.6$. We find values of $\smash{\overline{E}_G}(0.6)
= 0.16 \pm 0.09$ and $\smash{\overline{E}_G}(0.86) = 0.09 \pm 0.07$, when $E_G$ is averaged over
scales above $3 h^{-1} \rm{Mpc}$. We find that our $E_G$ measurements exhibit slightly lower values
than expected for standard relativistic gravity in a {\Lambda}CDM background, although the results
are consistent within $1-2\sigma$.
