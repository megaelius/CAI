We build templates of rotation curves as a function of the $I-$band luminosity via the mass modeling
(by the sum of a thin exponential disk and a cored halo profile) of suitably normalized, stacked data
from wide samples of local spiral galaxies. We then exploit such templates to determine fundamental
stellar and halo properties for a sample of about $550$ local disk-dominated galaxies with high-quality
measurements of the optical radius $R_{\rm opt}$ and of the corresponding rotation velocity $V_{\rm
opt}$. Specifically, we determine the stellar $M_\star$ and halo $M_{\rm H}$ masses, the halo size
$R_{\rm H}$ and velocity scale ${V_{\rm H}}$, and the specific angular momenta of the stellar $j_\star$
and dark matter $j_{\rm H}$ components. We derive global scaling relationships involving such
stellar and halo properties both for the individual galaxies in our sample and for their mean within
bins; the latter are found to be in pleasing agreement with previous determinations by independent
methods (e.g., abundance matching techniques, weak lensing observations, and individual rotation
curve modeling). Remarkably, the size of our sample and the robustness of our statistical approach
allow us to attain an unprecedented level of precision over an extended range of mass and velocity
scales, with $1\sigma$ dispersion around the mean relationships of less than $0.1$ dex. We thus
set new standard local relationships that must be reproduced by detailed physical models, that
offer a basis for improving the sub-grid recipes in numerical simulations, that provide a benchmark
to gauge independent observations and check for systematics, and that constitute a basic step toward
the future exploitation of the spiral galaxy population as a cosmological probe.
