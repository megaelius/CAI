Finding and classifying astronomical sources is key in the scientific exploitation of radio surveys.
Source-finding usually involves identifying the parts of an image belonging to an astronomical
source, against some estimated background. This can be problematic in the radio regime, owing to
the presence of correlated noise, which can interfere with the signal from the source. In the current
work we present AutoSource, a novel method based on a deep learning technique, to identify the positions
of radio sources, and compare the results to a Gaussian-fitting method. Since the deep learning
approach allows the generation of more training images, it should perform well in the source-finding
task. We test the source-finding methods on artificial data created for the data challenge of the
Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We investigate sources that are divided into three classes: star-forming
galaxies (SFGs) and two classes of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The artifical data is given at two
different frequencies (560 MHz and 1400 MHz), three total integration times (8 h, 100 h, 1000 h) and
three signal-to-noise ratios (1, 2, and 5). At lower SNRs, AutoSource tends to outperform a Gaussian-fitting
approach in the recovery of SFGs and all sources, although at the lowest SNR of 1, the better performance
is likely due to chance matches. The Gaussian-fitting method performs better in the recovery of
the AGN-type sources at lower SNRs. At a higher SNR, AutoSource performs better on average in the
recovery of AGN sources, whereas the Gaussian-fitting method performs better in the recovery of
SFGs and all sources. AutoSource usually performs better at shorter total integration times, and
detects more true positives and misses fewer sources compared to the Gaussian-fitting method,
however it detects more false positives.
