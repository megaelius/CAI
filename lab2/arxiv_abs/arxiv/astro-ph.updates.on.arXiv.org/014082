After the identification of a candidate $\gamma$-ray transient in the error region of the binary
black hole (BBH) merger GW150914 by the \textit{Fermi} satellite, the question of whether BBH mergers
can be associated to electromagnetic counterparts remains highly debated. Here, we present radio
follow-up observations of GW170608, a BBH merger that occurred during the second observing run
(O2) of the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). Our radio follow
up focused on a specific field contained in the GW170608 sky localization area, where a candidate
high-energy transient was detected by the \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT). We make use
of data collected at 1.4\,GHz with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), as well as with the VLA
Low-band Ionosphere and Transient Experiment (VLITE). Our analysis is sensitive to potential
radio afterglows with luminosity densities $L_{\rm 1.4\,GHz}\gtrsim 6\times10^{28}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$\,Hz$^{-1}$.
In the most optimistic theoretical models, $\approx 20\%$ of BBH events occurring in massive hosts
could be associated with outflows as radio luminous as this. Although we find no evidence for the
presence of a radio counterpart associated with the LAT candidate in the GW170608 error region,
our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of future radio follow-up observations of well localized
BBHs. Comparing our radio upper-limits with theoretical expectations for the radio afterglows
potentially associated with jets launched in BBH mergers, we find that for jets of energy $\approx
10^{49}$\,erg seen on-axis, only jet angles $\theta_{jet}\gtrsim 40^{\circ}$ are compatible
with the observations.
