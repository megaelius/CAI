We present sub-kpc-scale mapping of the 870 $\mu$m ALMA continuum emission in six luminous ($L_{\rm
IR}~\sim~5~\times10^{12}$ L$_{\odot}$) submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) from the ALESS survey
of the Extended Chandra Deep Field South. Our high-fidelity 0.07$''$-resolution imaging ($\sim$500
pc) reveals robust evidence for exponential dust disks which exhibit sub-kpc structure. The large-scale
morphologies of the structures are suggestive of bars, star-forming rings, and spiral arms. The
individual structures have deconvolved sizes of $\lesssim$0.5-1 kpc, and they collectively make
up $\sim$2-20% of the total 870 $\mu$m continuum emission we recover from a given galaxy. The ratio
of the `ring' and `bar' radii (1.7$\pm$0.3) agrees with that measured for such features in local
galaxies. These structures are consistent with the idea of tidal disturbances, with their detailed
properties implying flat inner rotation curves and Toomre-unstable disks ($Q<1$). The inferred
one-dimensional velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm r}\lesssim$ 70-160 km s$^{-1}$) are consistent
with the limits implied if the sizes of the largest structures are comparable to the Jeans length.
We create maps of the star formation rate density on $\sim$500 pc scales and show that the SMGs appear
to be able to sustain high rates of star formation over much larger physical scales than local (ultra-)luminous
infrared galaxies. However, on 500 pc scales, they do not exceed the Eddington limit set by radiation
pressure on dust. If confirmed by kinematics, the potential presence of non-axisymmetric structures
would provide a means for net angular momentum loss and efficient star formation, helping to explain
the very high star formation rates measured in SMGs.
