Some binary systems composed of a white dwarf (WD) and a hot sub-dwarf (sdB) helium star will make
contact within the helium burning lifetime of the sdB star at orbital periods of 20-30 minutes. The
accreted helium on the WD inevitably undergoes a thermonuclear instability, causing a detonation
that is expected to transition into the WD core and lead to a thermonuclear supernova. The short orbital
period at this moment implies donor orbital velocities of 700-900 km/s. Motivated by the recent
discovery of objects moving at these velocities and occupying unusual locations on the HR diagram,
we explore the impact of the thermonuclear supernovae on the donors in this specific double detonation
scenario. We use MESA to model the binary up to the moment of detonation, then 3D Athena++ to model
the hydrodynamic interaction of the supernova ejecta with the donor star, calculating the amount
of mass that is stripped and the entropy deposited in the deep stellar interior by the strong shock
that traverses it. Receiving little additional momentum from the ejecta, we show that these donor
remnants are simply ejected with velocities set by their original orbital speeds: 700-900 km/s.
We model the long-term thermal evolution of remnants by introducing the shock entropy into MESA
models. In response to this entropy change, donor remnants expand and brighten for timescales ranging
from $10^6$-$10^8$ years, giving ample time for these runaway stars to be observed in their inflated
state before they leave the galaxy. Even after surface layers are stripped, some donors retain enough
mass to resume core helium burning and further delay fading for more than $10^8$ years.
