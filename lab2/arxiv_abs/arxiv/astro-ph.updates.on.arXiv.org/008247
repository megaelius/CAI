Whilst there are observational indications that transverse MHD waves carry enough energy to maintain
the thermal structure of the solar corona, it is not clear whether such energy can be efficiently
and effectively converted into heating. Phase-mixing of Alfv\'en waves is considered a candidate
mechanism, as it can develop transverse gradient where magnetic energy can be converted into thermal
energy. However, phase-mixing is a process that crucially depends on the amplitude and period of
the transverse oscillations, and only recently have we obtained a complete measurement of the power
spectrum for transverse oscillations in the corona. We aim to investigate the heating generated
by phase-mixing of transverse oscillations triggered by buffeting of a coronal loop that follows
from the observed coronal power spectrum as well as the impact of these persistent oscillations
on the structure of coronal loops. We consider a 3D MHD model of an active region coronal loop and we
perturb its footpoints with a 2D horizontal driver that represents a random buffeting motion of
the loop footpoints. Our driver is composed of 1000 pulses superimposed to generate the observed
power spectrum. We find that the heating supply from the observed power spectrum in the solar corona
through phase mixing is not sufficient to maintain the million degree active region solar corona.
We also find that the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities could be a common phenomenon
in coronal loops that could affect their apparent life time. This study concludes that is unlikely
that phase-mixing of Alfv\'en waves resulting from an observed power spectrum of transverse coronal
loop oscillations can heat the active region solar corona. However, transverse waves could play
an important role in the development of small scale structures.
