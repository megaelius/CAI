In this work, we critically compare the two main solutions of the convergence problem, i.e. the $y$-parameterizations
of the redshift and the alternatives to Taylor expansions based on Pad\'e series. In particular,
among several possibilities, we consider two widely adopted parameterizations, namely $y_1=1-a$
and $y_2=\arctan(a^{-1}-1)$, being $a$ the scale factor of the Universe. We show the theoretical
conditions that both rational approximations and auxiliary variables should fulfill to make cosmography
more predictive when high-redshift data are involved. We therefore find that the $y_2$-parameterization
performs relatively better than the $y_1$-parameterization over the whole redshift domain. Even
though $y_2$ overcomes the issues of $y_1$, we get that the most viable approximations of the luminosity
distance $d_L(z)$ are given in terms of Pad\'e approximations. In order to check this result by means
of cosmic data, we analyze the Pad\'e approximations up to the fifth order, and compare these series
with the corresponding $y$-variables of the same orders. We investigate two distinct domains involving
Monte Carlo analysis on the Pantheon Superovae Ia data, $H(z)$ and shift parameter measurements.
We conclude that the (2,1) Pad\'e approximation is statistically the optimal approach to explain
low and high-redshift data, together with the fifth-order $y_2$-parameterization. At high redshifts,
the (3,2) Pad\'e approximation cannot be fully excluded, while the (2,2) Pad\'e one is essentially
ruled out. Our results are reinforced by the outcomes of the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria,
which lead to conclude unequivocally that the Pad\'e series are always more stable, smooth and suitable
than any kinds of auxiliary variables at both low and high redshifts.
