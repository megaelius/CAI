The magnetized wind from stars that impact exoplanets should lead to radio emissions. According
to the scaling laws derived in the solar system, the radio emission should depend on the stellar wind,
interplanetary magnetic field, and topology of the exoplanet magnetosphere. The aim of this study
is to calculate the dissipated power and subsequent radio emission from exoplanet magnetospheres
with different topologies perturbed by the interplanetary magnetic field and stellar wind, to
refine the predictions from scaling laws, and to prepare the interpretation of future radio detections.
We use the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code PLUTO in spherical coordinates to analyze the total radio
emission level resulting from the dissipation of the kinetic and magnetic (Poynting flux) energies
inside the exoplanet's magnetospheres. We apply a formalism to infer the detailed contribution
in the exoplanet radio emission on the exoplanet's day side and magnetotail. The model is based on
Mercury-like conditions, although the study results are extrapolated to exoplanets with stronger
magnetic fields, providing the lower bound of the radio emission. The predicted dissipated powers
and resulting radio emissions depends critically on the exoplanet magnetosphere topology and
interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) orientation. The radio emission on the exoplanet's night
and day sides should thus contain information on the exoplanet magnetic field topology. In addition,
if the topology of an exoplanet magnetosphere is known, the radio emission measurements can be used
as a proxy of the instantaneous dynamic pressure of the stellar wind, IMF orientation, and intensity.
