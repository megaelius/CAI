We report mid- to far-infrared imaging and photomety from 7 to 37 microns with SOFIA/FORCAST and
2 micron adaptive optics imaging with LBTI/LMIRCam of a large sample of red supergiants (RSGs) in
four Galactic clusters; RSGC1, RSGC2=Stephenson 2, RSGC3, and NGC 7419. The red supergiants in
these clusters cover their expected range in luminosity and initial mass from approximately 9 to
more than 25 Solar masses. The population includes examples of very late-type RSGs such as MY Cep
which may be near the end of the RSG stage, high mass losing maser sources, yellow hypergiants and
post-RSG candidates. Many of the stars and almost all of the most luminous have spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) with extended infrared excess radiation at the longest wavelengths. To best model their
SEDs we use DUSTY with a variable radial density distribution function to estimate their mass loss
rates. Our mass loss rate -- luminosity relation for 42 RSGs basically follows the classical de Jager
curve, but at luminosities below 10^5 Solar luminosities we find a significant population of red
supergiants with mass loss rate below the de Jager relation. At luminosities above 10^5 Solar luminosities
there is a rapid transition to higher mass loss rates that approximates and overlaps the de Jager
curve. We recommend that instead of using a linear relation or single curve, the empirical mass loss
rate -- luminosity relation is better represented by a broad band. Interestingly, the transition
to much higher mass loss rates at about 10^5 Lsun corresponds approximately to an initial mass of
18 --20 Msun which is close to the upper limit for RSGs becoming Type II SNe.
