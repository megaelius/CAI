We investigate scalar-tensor theories where matter couples to the scalar field via a kinetically
dependent conformal coupling. These models can be seen as the low-energy description of invariant
field theories under a global Abelian symmetry. The scalar field is then identified with the Goldstone
mode of the broken symmetry. It turns out that the properties of these models are very similar to the
ones of ultralocal theories where the scalar-field value is directly determined by the local matter
density. This leads to a complete screening of the fifth force in the Solar System and between compact
objects, through the ultralocal screening mechanism. On the other hand, the fifth force can have
large effects in extended structures with large-scale density gradients, such as galactic halos.
Interestingly, it can either amplify or damp Newtonian gravity, depending on the model parameters.
We also study the background cosmology and the linear cosmological perturbations. The background
cosmology is hardly different from its $\Lambda$-CDM counterpart whilst cosmological perturbations
crucially depend on whether the coupling function is convex or concave. For concave functions,
growth is hindered by the repulsiveness of the fifth force whilst it is enhanced in the convex case.
In both cases, the departures from the $\Lambda$-CDM cosmology increase on smaller scales and peak
for galactic structures. For concave functions, the formation of structure is largely altered
below some characteristic mass, as smaller structures are delayed and would form later through
fragmentation, as in some warm dark matter scenarios. For convex models, small structures form
more easily than in the $\Lambda$-CDM scenario.
