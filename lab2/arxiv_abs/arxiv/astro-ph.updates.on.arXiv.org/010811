The low luminosity of Uranus is a longstanding challenge in planetary science. Simple adiabatic
models are inconsistent with the measured luminosity, which indicates that Uranus is non-adiabatic
due to the existence of thermal boundary layers and/or conductive regions. A gradual composition
distribution acts as a thermal boundary to suppress convection and slow down the internal cooling.
Here we investigate whether composition gradients in Uranus' deep interior can explain its low
luminosity, what composition gradient is required, and whether it is stable for convective-mixing
for a timescale of billion of years. We vary the primordial composition distribution and the planet
initial energy budget, and opt the models that fit Uranus measured properties (radius, luminosity,
and moment of inertia) at present time. We present several alternative non-adiabatic internal
structures that fit Uranus measurements. It is found that convection-mixing is limited in Uranus
interior and a composition gradient is stable and sufficient to explain its current luminosity.
As a result, Uranus' interior could still be very hot, in spite of its low luminosity. The stable composition
gradient also indicates that Uranus' current-state internal structure is not very different from
its primordial one. Moreover, initial energy content of Uranus cannot be greater than 20% of its
formation (accretion) energy. We also find that an interior with ice+rock mixture, rather than
separated ice and rock shells, is consistent with measurements, suggesting that Uranus might not
be "differentiated". Our models can explain Uranus' luminosity and are also consistent with its
metal-rich atmosphere, and the predictions for the location where its magnetic field is generated.
