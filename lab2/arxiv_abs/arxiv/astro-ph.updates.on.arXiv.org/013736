We present $UBVRI$ photometry of 8702 stars in a $0.5 ^\circ\times0.5 ^\circ$ field in the direction
of NGC 7142, taken with the Half Degree Imager (HDI) at the WIYN 0.9-meter telescope, to improve knowledge
of this cluster's basic parameters. Our photometry spans the ranges 10.6 - 20.4 mag in $U$, 10.6 -
22.0 mag in $B$, 10.0 - 21.8 mag in $V$, 9.2 - 20.7 mag in $R$, and 8.5 - 19.9 mag in $I$. Using color-color
diagrams that employ all four color combinations that include $U$, versus $B-V$, we derive a reddening-metallicity
relation for the cluster, with preferred values $E(B-V$) = 0.338 $\pm$ 0.031 mag for the left-edge
fiducial of the main sequence and [Fe/H] = 0.0 $\pm$ 0.1 dex, where the Hyades cluster has been used
as an unreddened reference cluster, the extinction relations of Cardelli have been employed, and
the metallicity dependence of the Yonsei-Yale ($Y^2$) isochrones has been assumed. Comparison
of our data to the $Y^2$ isochrones in multiple color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) yields distance-metallicity
and age-metallicity relations, with preferred values of $m-M\ =\ 12.65\ \pm\ 0.23$ mag and age =
$4.0 ^{-0.7}_{+1.3}$ Gyr. Re-evaluation of the parameters of M67 using Stetson's $UBVI$ photometry
yields [Fe/H] = -0.02 $\pm$ 0.05 dex, $E(B-V$) = 0.04 $\pm$ 0.01 mag, $m-M$ = 9.75 $\pm$ 0.03 mag, and
age = 3.85 $\pm$ 0.17 Gyr; we thus find the metallicity and age of the two clusters to be indistinguishable.
A semi-independent analysis adopting the parameters of M67 and shifting the fiducials of the two
clusters in six CMDs until they match strongly corroborates the values listed above. The differences
between our inferred parallaxes and the Gaia DR2 values are $87\ \pm\ 60$ $\mu$as for NGC 7142 and
48 $\pm$ 15 $\mu$as for M67, consistent with previous studies.
