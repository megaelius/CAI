Recent statistical deconvolution methods have produced extended kinematical maps in a range of
heliocentric distances that are a factor of two to three larger than those analysed in the Gaia Collaboration
based on the same data. In this paper, we use such maps to derive the rotation curve both in the Galactic
plane and in off-plane regions and to analyse the density distribution. By assuming stationary
equilibrium and axisymmetry, we used the Jeans equation to derive the rotation curve. Then we fit
it with density models that include both dark matter and predictions of the MOND (Modified Newtonian
dynamics) theory. Since the Milky Way exhibits deviations from axisymmetry and equilibrium, we
also considered corrections to the Jeans equation. To compute such corrections, we ran N-body experiments
of mock disk galaxies where the departure from equilibrium becomes larger as a function of the distance
from the centre. The rotation curve in the outer disk of the Milky Way that is constructed with the
Jeans equation exhibits very low dependence on $R$ and $z$ and it is well-fitted both by dark matter
halo and MOND models. The application of the Jeans equation for deriving the rotation curve, in the
case of the systems that deviate from equilibrium and axisymmetry, introduces systematic errors
that grow as a function of the amplitude of the average radial velocity. In the case of the Milky Way,
we can observe that the amplitude of the radial velocity reaches $\sim 10\%$ that of the azimuthal
one at $R\approx 20$ kpc. Based on this condition, using the rotation curve obtained from the Jeans
equation to calculate the mass may overestimate its measurement.
