We present early science results from the First Large Absorption Survey in HI (FLASH), a spectroscopically
blind survey for 21-cm absorption lines in cold hydrogen HI gas at cosmological distances using
the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). We have searched for HI absorption towards
1253 radio sources in the GAMA 23 field, covering redshifts between $z = 0.34$ and $0.79$ over a sky
area of approximately 50 square degrees. In a purely blind search we did not obtain any detections
of 21-cm absorbers above our reliability threshold. Assuming a fiducial value for the HI spin temperature
of $T_{\rm spin}$ = 100 K and source covering fraction $c_{\rm f} = 1$, the total comoving absorption
path length sensitive to all Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ Absorbers (DLAs; $N_{\rm HI} \geq 2 \times 10^{20}$
cm$^{-2}$) is $\Delta{X} = 6.6 \pm 0.3$ ($\Delta{z} = 3.7 \pm 0.2$) and super-DLAs ($N_{\rm HI} \geq
2 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$) is $\Delta{X} = 111 \pm 6$ ($\Delta{z} = 63 \pm 3$). We estimate upper
limits on the HI column density frequency distribution function that are consistent with measurements
from prior surveys for redshifted optical DLAs, and nearby 21-cm emission and absorption. By cross
matching our sample of radio sources with optical spectroscopic identifications of galaxies in
the GAMA 23 field, we were able to detect 21-cm absorption at $z = 0.3562$ towards NVSS J224500$-$343030,
with a column density of $N_{\rm HI} = (1.2 \pm 0.1) \times 10^{20} (T_{\rm spin}/100~\mathrm{K})$
cm$^{-2}$. The absorber is associated with GAMA J22450.05$-$343031.7, a massive early-type galaxy
at an impact parameter of 17 kpc with respect to the radio source and which may contain a massive ($M_{\rm
HI} \gtrsim 3 \times 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$) gas disc. Such gas-rich early types are rare, but have
been detected in the nearby Universe.
