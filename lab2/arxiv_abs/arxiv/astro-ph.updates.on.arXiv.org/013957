We performed an intensive accretion disk reverberation mapping campaign on the high accretion
rate active galactic nucleus Mrk 142 in early 2019. Mrk 142 was monitored with the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory for 4 months in X-rays and 6 UV/optical filters. Ground-based photometric monitoring
was obtained from the Las Cumbres Observatory, Liverpool Telescope and Dan Zowada Memorial Observatory
in ugriz filters and the Yunnan Astronomical Observatory in V. Mrk 142 was highly variable throughout,
displaying correlated variability across all wavelengths. We measure significant time lags between
the different wavelength light curves, finding that through the UV and optical the wavelength-dependent
lags, $\tau(\lambda)$, generally follow the relation $\tau(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{4/3}$,
as expected for the $T\propto R^{-3/4}$ profile of a steady-state optically-thick, geometrically-thin
accretion disk, though can also be fit by $\tau(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{2}$, as expected for
a slim disk. The exceptions are the u and U band, where an excess lag is observed, as has been observed
in other AGN and attributed to continuum emission arising in the broad-line region. Furthermore,
we perform a flux-flux analysis to separate the constant and variable components of the spectral
energy distribution, finding that the flux-dependence of the variable component is consistent
with the $f_\nu\propto\nu^{1/3}$ spectrum expected for a geometrically-thin accretion disk.
Moreover, the X-ray to UV lag is significantly offset from an extrapolation of the UV/optical trend,
with the X-rays showing a poorer correlation with the UV than the UV does with the optical. The magnitude
of the UV/optical lags is consistent with a highly super-Eddington accretion rate.
