The standard wide-field imaging technique, the $w$-projection, allows correction for wide-fields
of view for non-coplanar radio interferometric arrays. However, calculating exact corrections
for each measurement has not been possible due to the amount of computation required at high resolution
and with the large number of visibilities from current interferometers. The required accuracy
and computational cost of these corrections is one of the largest unsolved challenges facing next
generation radio interferometers such as the Square Kilometre Array. We show that the same calculation
can be performed with a radially symmetric $w$-projection kernel, where we use one dimensional
adaptive quadrature to calculate the resulting Hankel transform, decreasing the computation
required for kernel generation by several orders of magnitude, whilst preserving the accuracy.
We demonstrate the potential of our radially symmetric $w$-projection kernel via sparse image
reconstruction, using the software package Purify. We develop an MPI distributed $w$-stacking
and $w$-projection hybrid algorithm, where we apply exact $w$-term corrections for 100 million
measurements with $w$-terms between $\pm 300$ wavelengths, for a $17^\circ$ field of view and image
size of 4096 by 4096 pixels. The pre-computation and reconstruction took a total time of 35 minutes.
Such a level of accuracy and scalability is not possible with standard $w$-projection kernel generation
methods. This demonstrates that we can scale to the large number of measurements and large image
sizes expected from next generation interferometers whilst still maintaining both speed and accuracy.
This work is a critical development for resolving one of the biggest unsolved challenges in interferometry.
