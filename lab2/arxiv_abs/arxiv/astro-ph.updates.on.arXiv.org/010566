The theoretical apsidal motion constants are key tools to investigate the stellar interiors in
close eccentric binary systems. In addition, these constants and the moment of inertia are also
important to investigate the tidal evolution of close binary stars as well as of exo-planetary systems.
The aim of the paper is to present new evolutionary models, based on the MESA package, that include
the internal structure constants (k$_2$, k$_3$, and k$_4$), the radius of gyration, and the gravitational
potential energy for configurations computed from the pre-main-sequence (PMS) up to the first
ascent giant branch or beyond. The calculations are available for the three metallicities [Fe/H]=
0.00, -0.50, and -1.00, which take the recent investigations in less metallic environments into
account. This new set of models replaces the old ones, published about 15 years ago, using the code
GRANADA. Core overshooting was taken into account using the mass-f$_{ov}$ relationship, which
was derived semi-empirically for models more massive than 1.2 M$_{\odot}$. The differential equations
governing the apsidal motion constants, moment of inertia, and the gravitational potential energy
were integrated simultaneously through a fifth-order Runge-Kutta method with a tolerance level
of 10$^{-7}$. The resulting models (from 0.8 up to 35.0 M$_{\odot}$) are presented in 54 tables for
the three metallicities, containing the usual characteristics of an evolutionary model (age,
initial masses, log T$_{\rm eff}$, log g, and log L), the constants of internal structure (k$_2$,
k$_3$, and k$_4$), the radius of gyration $\beta,$ and the factor $\alpha$ that is related with the
gravitational potential energy.
