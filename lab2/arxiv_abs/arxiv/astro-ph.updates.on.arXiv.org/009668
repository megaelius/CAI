Aims. We present a sample of 4388 AGNs with available radio core-dominance parameters defined as
the ratio of the core flux densities to extended ones, namely, R = Score/Sext., which includes 630
Fermi-detected AGNs respect to the catalog of 4FGL, the fourth Fermi Large Area Telescope source
catalog, and the rest of them are non-Fermi-detected AGNs. In our sample, 584 blazars are Fermi-detected
and 1310 are not, and also consists of other subclasses such as Seyfert, Fanaroff-Riley I/II and
normal galaxies. We investigate various different properties between Fermi-detected AGNs and
non-Fermi-detected ones by using the core-dominance parameters as the previous study has shown
that R is a good indication of beaming effect. Methods. We then calculate the radio spectral indices
for whole sample and adopt {\gamma}-ray photon indices for Fermi AGNs from 4FGL catalog for discussing
their different performances on different subclasses, and obtain the relation between core-dominance
parameters and radio spectral indices for both Fermi and non-Fermi sources according to the two
components model on radio band, which are consistent with our previous study. Results. We found
that the core-dominance parameters and radio spectral indices are quite different for different
subclasses of AGNs, not only for Fermi sources but also non-Fermi sources, particularly, R for the
former ones is averagely higher than later ones. We also adopt the same relation on core-dominance
parameters and {\gamma}-ray photon indices for Fermi sources by taking the same assumption with
two components model on {\gamma}-ray band, and obtain the fitting results indicating that the {\gamma}-ray
emissions of Fermi blazars are mainly from the core component, which is perhaps associated with
the beaming effect. Therefore, Fermi blazars are beamed.
