The apparent lack of massive O-type stars near the Zero Age Main Sequence (at ages < 2 Myr) has been
a topic widely discussed. Different explanations for this elusive detection have been proposed,
but no firm conclusions have been reached yet. We perform a reassessment of this empirical result
benefiting from the high quality spectroscopic observations of >400 Galactic O-type stars gathered
by the IACOB and OWN surveys. We use temperatures and gravities from a iacob-gbat/fastwind spectroscopic
analysis to locate our sample in the Kiel and spectroscopic HR diagrams. We evaluate the completeness
of our sample of stars, observational biases using information from the Galactic O star catalog
(GOSC), systematics of our methodology, and compare with other recent studies using smaller samples
of Galactic O-type stars. We base our discussion on the spectroscopic HR diagram to avoid the use
of uncertain distances. We perform a detailed study of the young cluster Trumpler-14 as an example
of how Gaia cluster distances can help to construct the associated classical HR diagram. The apparent
lack of massive O-type stars near the ZAMS with masses between 30 and 70 Msol persist despite using
spectroscopic results from a large, non-biased sample of stars. We do not find correlations between
the dearth of stars and observational biases, limitations of our methodology, or the use of spectroscopic
HR diagram instead of the classical one. Investigating the efficiency of mass accretion during
the formation process we conclude that an adjustment of the accretion rate towards lower values
could reconcile the hotter boundary of detected O-type stars and the theoretical birthline. Last,
we discuss that the presence of a small sample of O2-O3.5 stars found closer to the ZAMS could be explained
taking into account non-standard star evolution (e.g. binary interaction, mergers, or homogeneous
evolution).
