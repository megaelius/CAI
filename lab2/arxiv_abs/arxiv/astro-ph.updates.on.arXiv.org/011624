We report the results of an extensive radio-continuum observing campaign of host galaxies of short
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The goal of this survey was to search for optically obscured star formation,
possibly indicative of a population of young short-GRB progenitors. Our sample comprises the hosts
and host-galaxy candidates of 16 short-GRBs from 2005 to 2015, corresponding to roughly 1/3 of the
presently known ensemble of well-localized short bursts. Eight GRB fields were observed with ATCA
(at 5.5 and 9.0 GHz), and eight fields with the VLA (mostly at 5.5 GHz). The observations typically
achieved a 1-sigma_rms of 5 to 8 microJy. In most cases they were performed years after the corresponding
burst. No new short-GRB host with optically obscured star formation was found. Only one host galaxy
was detected, the one of GRB 100206A at z=0.407. However, its starburst nature was already known
from optical/IR data. Its measured radio flux can be interpreted as being due to a star formation
rate (SFR) of about 60 M_sol/yr. This is in good agreement with earlier expectations based on the
observed broad-band spectral energy distribution of this galaxy. The 15 non-detections constrain
the SFRs of the suspected host galaxies and provide upper limits on late-time luminosities of the
associated radio afterglows and predicted kilonova radio flares. The non-detection of radio emission
from GRB explosion sites confirms the intrinsically low luminosity of short-GRB afterglows and
places significant constraints on the parameter space of magnetar-powered radio flares. Luminous
radio flares from fiducial massive magnetars have not been found.
