Recent studies have proposed that most warm Jupiters (WJs, giant planets with semi-major axes in
the range of 0.1-1 AU) probably form in-situ, or arrive in their observed orbits through disk migration.
However, both in-situ formation and disk migration, in their simplest flavors, predict WJs to be
in low-eccentricity orbits, in contradiction with many observed WJs that are moderately eccentric
(e=0.2-0.7). This paper examines the possibility that the WJ eccentricities are raised by secular
interactions with exterior giant planet companions, following in-situ formation or migration
on a circular orbit. Eccentricity growth may arise from an inclined companion (through Lidov-Kozai
cycles), or from an eccentric, nearly coplanar companion (through apsidal precession resonances).
We quantify the necessary conditions (in terms of the eccentricity, semi-major axis and inclination)
for external perturbers of various masses to raise the WJ eccentricity. We also consider the sample
of eccentric WJs with detected outer companions, and for each system, identify the range of mutual
inclinations needed to generate the observed eccentricity. For most systems, we find that relatively
high inclinations (at least $\sim 40^\circ$) are needed so that Lidov-Kozai cycles are induced;
the observed outer companions are typically not sufficiently eccentric to generate the observed
WJ eccentricity in a low-inclination configuration. The results of this paper place constraints
on possibly unseen external companions to eccentric WJs. Observations that probe mutual inclinations
of giant planet systems will help clarify the origin of eccentric WJs and the role of external companions.
