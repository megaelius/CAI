We perform a survey of the X-ray properties of 41 objects from the WISE/SDSS selected Hyper-luminous
(WISSH) quasars sample, composed by 86 broad-line quasars (QSOs) with bolometric luminosity $L_{Bol}\geq
2\times 10^{47}\,erg\, s^{-1}$, at z~2-4. All but 3 QSOs show unabsorbed 2-10 keV luminosities
$L_{2-10}\geq10^{45} \,erg \,s^{-1}$. Thanks to their extreme radiative output across the Mid-IR-to-X-ray
range, WISSH QSOs offer the opportunity to significantly extend and validate the existing relations
involving $L_{2-10}$. We study $L_{2-10}$ as a function of (i) X-ray-to-Optical (X/O) flux ratio,
(ii) mid-IR luminosity ($L_{MIR}$), (iii) $L_{Bol}$ as well as (iv) $\alpha_{OX}$ vs. the 2500$\mathring{A}$
luminosity. We find that WISSH QSOs show very low X/O(<0.1) compared to typical AGN values; $L_{2-10}/L_{MIR}$
ratios significantly smaller than those derived for AGN with lower luminosity; large X-ray bolometric
corrections $k_{\rm Bol,X}\sim$ 100-1000; and steep $-2<\alpha_{OX}<-1.7$. These results lead
to a scenario where the X-ray emission of hyper-luminous quasars is relatively weaker compared
to lower-luminosity AGN. Models predict that such an X-ray weakness can be relevant for the acceleration
of powerful high-ionization emission line-driven winds, commonly detected in the UV spectra of
WISSH QSOs, which can in turn perturb the X-ray corona and weaken its emission. Accordingly, hyper-luminous
QSOs represent the ideal laboratory to study the link between the AGN energy output and wind acceleration.
Additionally, WISSH QSOs show very large BH masses ($\log[M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot}]$>9.5). This
enables a more robust modeling of the $\Gamma-M_{BH}$ relation by increasing the statistics at
high masses. We derive a flatter $\Gamma$ dependence than previously found over the broad range
5 <$\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot})$ < 11.
