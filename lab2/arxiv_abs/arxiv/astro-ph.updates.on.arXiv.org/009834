The LOFAR radio telescope discovered the $707$-Hz binary millisecond pulsar J0952$-$0607 in a
targeted radio pulsation search of an unidentified $\textit{Fermi}$ gamma-ray source. This source
shows a weak energy flux of $F_\gamma = 2.6 \times 10^{-12}\,\text{erg}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\,\text{s}^{-1}$
in the energy range between $100\,\text{MeV} - 100\,\text{GeV}$. Here we report the detection
of pulsed gamma-ray emission from PSR$\,$J0952$-$0607 in a very sensitive gamma-ray pulsation
search. The pulsar's rotational, binary and astrometric properties are measured over seven years
of $\textit{Fermi}$-Large Area Telescope data. For this we take into account the uncertainty on
the shape of the gamma-ray pulse profile. We present an updated radio timing solution now spanning
more than two years and show results from optical modeling of the black-widow-type companion based
on new multi-band photometric data taken with HiPERCAM on the Gran Telescopio Canarias on La Palma
and ULTRACAM on the New Technology Telescope at ESO La Silla. PSR$\,$J0952$-$0607 is now the fastest-spinning
pulsar for which the intrinsic spin-down rate has been reliably constrained ($\dot{P}_\text{int}
< 4.6 \times 10^{-21}\,\text{s}\,\text{s}^{-1}$). The inferred surface magnetic field strength
of $B_\text{surf} \lesssim 8.2 \times 10^{7}\,\text{G}$ is among the ten lowest of all known pulsars.
This discovery is another example of an extremely fast spinning black-widow pulsar hiding within
an unidentified $\textit{Fermi}$ gamma-ray source. In the future such systems might help to pin
down the maximum spin frequency and the minimum surface magnetic field strength of millisecond
pulsars.
