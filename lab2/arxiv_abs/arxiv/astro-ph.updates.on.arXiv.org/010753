On 2019 August 14 the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the Virgo
gravitational wave interferometer announced the detection of a binary merger, S190814bv, with
a low false alarm rate (FAR) of about 1 in $1.6\times 10^{25}$ years, a distance of $267\pm 52$ Mpc,
a 90\% (50\%) localization region of about 23 (5) deg$^2$, and a probability of being a neutron star--black
hole (NS-BH) merger of $>99\%$. The LIGO/Virgo Collaboration (LVC) defines NS-BH such that the
lighter binary member has a mass of $<3$ M$_\odot$ and the more massive one has $>5$ M$_\odot$, and
this classification is in principle consistent with a BH-BH merger depending on the actual upper
mass cut-off for neutron stars. Additionally, the LVC designated a probability that the merger
led to matter outside the final BH remnant of $<1\%$, suggesting that an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart
is unlikely. Here we report our optical follow-up observations of S190814bv using the Magellan
Baade 6.5 m telescope to target all 96 galaxies in the GLADE catalog within the 50\% localization
volume (representing about 70\% of the integrated luminosity within this region). No counterpart
was identified to a median $3\sigma$ limiting magnitude of $i=22.2$ ($M_i\approx -14.9$ mag),
comparable to the brightness of the optical counterpart of the binary neutron star merger GW170817
at the distance of S190814bv; similarly, we can rule out an on-axis jet typical of short GRBs. However,
we cannot rule out other realistic models, such as a kilonova with only $\sim 0.01$ M$_\odot$ of lanthanide-rich
material, or an off-axis jet with a viewing angle of $\theta_{\rm obs}\gtrsim 15^\circ$.
