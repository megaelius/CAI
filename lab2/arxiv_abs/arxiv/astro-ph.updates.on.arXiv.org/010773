As some of the only Lyman continuum (LyC) emitters at z~0, Green Pea (GP) galaxies are possible analogs
of the sources that reionized the universe. We present HST COS spectra of 13 of the most highly ionized
GPs, with [O III]/[O II]=6-35, and investigate correlations between Ly-alpha, galaxy properties,
and low-ionization UV lines. Galaxies with high [O III]/[O II] have higher H-alpha equivalent widths
(EWs), and high intrinsic Ly-alpha production may explain the prevalence of high Ly-alpha EWs among
GPs. While Ly-alpha escape fraction is closely linked to low gas covering fractions, implying a
clumpy gas geometry, narrow Ly-alpha velocity peak separation (delta_v,LyA) correlates with
the ionization state, suggesting a density-bounded geometry. We therefore suggest that delta_v,LyA
may trace the residual transparency of low-column-density pathways. Metallicity is associated
with both [O III]/[O II] and delta_v,LyA. This trend may result from catastrophic cooling around
low-metallicity star clusters, which generates a compact geometry of dense clouds within a low-density
inter-clump medium. We find that the relative strength of low-ionization UV emission to absorption
correlates with Ly-alpha emission strength and is related to Ly-alpha profile shape. However,
as expected for optically thin objects, the GPs with the lowest delta_v,LyA show both weak low-ionization
emission and weak absorption. The strengths of the low-ionization absorption and emission lines
in a stacked spectrum do not correspond to any individual spectrum. Galaxies with high [O III]/[O
II] contain a high fraction of LyC emitter candidates, but [O III]/[O II] alone is an insufficient
diagnostic of LyC escape.
