We present here a systematic search for cyanopolyynes in the shock region L1157-B1 and its associated
protostar L1157-mm in the framework of the Large Program "Astrochemical Surveys At IRAM" (ASAI),
dedicated to chemical surveys of solar-type star forming regions with the IRAM 30m telescope. Observations
of the millimeter windows between 72 and 272 GHz permitted the detection of HC$_3$N and its $^{13}$C
isotopologues, and HC$_5$N (for the first time in a protostellar shock region). In the shock, analysis
of the line profiles shows that the emission arises from the outflow cavities associated with L1157-B1
and L1157-B2. Molecular abundances and excitation conditions were obtained from analysis of the
Spectral Line Energy Distributions under the assumption of Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium
or using a radiative transfer code in the Large Velocity Gradient approximation. Towards L1157mm,
the HC$_3$N emission arises from the cold envelope ($T_{rot}=10$ K) and a higher-excitation region
($T_{rot}$= $31$ K) of smaller extent around the protostar. We did not find any evidence of $^{13}$C
or D fractionation enrichment towards L1157-B1. We obtain a relative abundance ratio HC$_3$N/HC$_5$N
of 3.3 in the shocked gas. We find an increase by a factor of 30 of the HC$_3$N abundance between the
envelope of L1157-mm and the shock region itself. Altogether, these results are consistent with
a scenario in which the bulk of HC$_3$N was produced by means of gas phase reactions in the passage
of the shock. This scenario is supported by the predictions of a parametric shock code coupled with
the chemical model UCL_CHEM.
