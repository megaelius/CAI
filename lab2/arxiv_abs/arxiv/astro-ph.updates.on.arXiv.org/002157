Context. The dynamical evolution of near-parabolic comets strongly depends on the starting values
of the orbital elements derived from the positional observations. In addition, when drawing conclusions
about the origin of these objects, it is crucial to control the uncertainties of orbital elements
at each stage of the dynamical evolution. Aims. I apply a completely homogeneous approach to determine
the cometary orbits and their uncertainties. The resulting catalogue is suitable for the investigation
of the origin and future of near-parabolic comets. Methods. First, osculating orbits were determined
on the basis of positional data. Second, the dynamical calculations were performed backwards and
forwards up to 250 au from the Sun to derive original and future barycentric orbits for each comet.
In the present investigation of dynamical evolution, the numerical calculations for a given object
start from the swarm of virtual comets constructed using the previously determined osculating
(nominal) orbit. In this way, the uncertainties of orbital elements were derived at the end of numerical
calculations. Results. Homogeneous sets of orbital elements for osculating, original and future
orbits are given. The catalogue of 119 cometary orbits constitutes about 70 per cent of all the first
class so-called Oort spike comets discovered during the period of 1801-2010 and about 90 per cent
of those discovered in 1951-2010, for which observations were completed at the end of 2013. Non-gravitational
(NG) orbits are derived for 45 comets, including asymmetric NG~solution for six of them. Additionally,
the new method for cometary orbit-quality assessment is applied for all these objects.
