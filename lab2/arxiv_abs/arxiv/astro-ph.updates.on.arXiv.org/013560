This contribution investigates the properties of a category of orbits around Enceladus. The motivation
is the interest in the in situ exploration of this moon following the detection on behalf of Cassini
of plumes of water and organic compounds close to its south pole. In a previous investigation, a set
of heteroclinic transfers were designed between Halo orbits around the equilibrium points L1 and
L2 of the circular restricted three-body problem with Saturn and Enceladus as primaries. The kinematical
and geometrical characteristics of those trajectories makes them good candidates as science orbits
for the extended observation of the surface of Enceladus: they are highly inclined, they approach
the moon and they are maneuver free. However, the low heights above the surface and the strong perturbing
effect of Saturn impose a more careful look at their dynamics, in particular regarding the influence
of the polar flattening of the primaries. Therefore, those solutions are here reconsidered by employing
a dynamical model that includes the effect of the oblateness of Saturn and Enceladus, individually
and in combination. Substitutes of the Halo orbits around the equilibrium points L1 and L2 and their
stable and unstable hyperbolic invariant manifolds are obtained in the perturbed models, and maneuver-free
heteroclinic transfers are identified in the new framework. A systematic comparison with the corresponding
solutions of the unperturbed problem shows that qualitative and quantitative features are not
significantly altered when the oblateness of the primaries is taken into account, and that J2 of
Saturn plays a larger role than the oblateness of Enceladus. From a mission perspective, the results
confirm the scientific value of the solutions obtained in the classical circular restricted three-body
problem and suggests that this simpler model can be used in a preliminary feasibility analysis.
