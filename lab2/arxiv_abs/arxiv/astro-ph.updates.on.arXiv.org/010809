The mass accretion rate is a crucial parameter for the study of the evolution of accretion discs around
young low-mass stellar and substellar objects (YSOs). We revisit the case of MYLup, an object where
VLT/X-Shooter data suggested a negligible mass accretion rate, and show it to be accreting on a level
similar to other ClassII YSOs in Lupus based on HST observations. In our HST-COS and -STIS spectra,
we find many emission lines, as well as substantial FUV continuum excess emission, which can be ascribed
to active accretion. The total luminosity of the CIV 1549A doublet is 4.1$\times10^{-4}$ Lsun.
Using scalings between accretion luminosity, Lacc, and CIV luminosity from the literature, we
derive Lacc $\sim$2$\times10^{-1}$ Lsun, which is more than an order of magnitude higher than the
upper limit estimated from the X-Shooter observations. We discuss possible reasons for the X-Shooter-HST
discrepancy, the most plausible being that the low contrast between the continuum excess emission
and the photospheric+chromospheric emission at optical wavelengths in MYLup hampered detection
of excess emission. The luminosity of the FUV continuum and CIV lines, strong H$_{2}$ fluorescence,
and a "1600 A Bump" place MYLup in the class of accreting objects with gas-rich discs. So far, MYLup
is the only peculiar case in which a significant difference between the HST and X-Shooter Macc estimates
exists that is not ascribable to variability. The mass accretion rate inferred from the revisited
Lacc estimate is Macc $\sim$ 1( $^{+1.5}_{-0.5}$ )$\times10^{-8}$ Msun/yr. This value is consistent
with the typical value derived for accreting YSOs of similar mass in Lupus and points to less clearing
of the inner disc than indicated by near- and mid-infrared observations. This is confirmed by ALMA
data, which show that the gaps and rings seen in the sub-millimetre are relatively shallow.
