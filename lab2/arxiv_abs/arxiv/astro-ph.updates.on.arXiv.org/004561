Context: Convectively-driven flows play a crucial role in the dynamo processes that are responsible
for producing magnetic activity in stars and planets. It is still not fully understood why many astrophysical
magnetic fields have a significant large-scale component. Aims: Our aim is to investigate the dynamo
properties of compressible convection in a rapidly rotating Cartesian domain, focusing upon a
parameter regime in which the underlying hydrodynamic flow is known to be unstable to a large-scale
vortex instability. Methods: The governing equations of three-dimensional nonlinear magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) are solved numerically. Different numerical schemes are compared and we propose a possible
benchmark case for other similar codes. Results: In keeping with previous related studies, we find
that convection in this parameter regime can drive a large-scale dynamo. The components of the mean
horizontal magnetic field oscillate, leading to a continuous overall rotation of the mean field.
Whilst the large-scale vortex instability dominates the early evolution of the system, it is suppressed
by the magnetic field and makes a negligible contribution to the mean electromotive force that is
responsible for driving the large-scale dynamo. The cycle period of the dynamo is comparable to
the ohmic decay time, with longer cycles for dynamos in convective systems that are closer to onset.
In these particular simulations, large-scale dynamo action is found only when vertical magnetic
field boundary conditions are adopted at the upper and lower boundaries. Strongly modulated large-scale
dynamos are found at higher Rayleigh numbers, with periods of reduced activity ("grand minima"-like
events) occurring during transient phases in which the large-scale vortex temporarily re-establishes
itself, before being suppressed again by the magnetic field.
