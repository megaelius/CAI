Waves have long been thought to contribute to the heating of the solar corona and the generation of
the solar wind. Recent observations have demonstrated evidence of quasi-periodic longitudinal
disturbances and ubiquitous transverse wave propagation in many different coronal environments.
This paper investigates signatures of different types of oscillatory behaviour, both above the
solar limb and on-disk, by comparing findings from the Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (CoMP)
and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) for the
same active region. We study both transverse and longitudinal motion by comparing and contrasting
time-distance images of parallel and perpendicular cuts along/across active region fan loops.
Comparisons between parallel space-time features in CoMP Doppler velocity and transverse oscillations
in AIA images are made, together with space-time analysis of propagating quasi-periodic intensity
features seen near the base of loops in AIA. Signatures of transverse motions are observed along
the same magnetic structure using CoMP Doppler velocity (Vphase=600-750km/s, P=3-6mins) and
in AIA/SDO above the limb (P=3-8mins). Quasi-periodic intensity features (Vphase=100-200km/s,
P=6-11mins) also travel along the base of the same structure. On the disk, signatures of both transverse
and longitudinal intensity features were observed by AIA; both show similar properties to signatures
found along structures anchored in the same active region three days earlier above the limb. Correlated
features are recovered by space-time analysis of neighbouring tracks over perpendicular distances
of <2.6Mm.
