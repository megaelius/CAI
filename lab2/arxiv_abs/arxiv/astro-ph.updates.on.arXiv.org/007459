Magnetic fields play a very important role in the evolution of galaxies through their direct impact
on star formation and stellar feedback-induced turbulence. However, their co-evolution with
these processes has still not been thoroughly investigated, and the possible effect of the initial
conditions is largely unknown. This letter presents the first results from a series of high-resolution
numerical models, aimed at deciphering the effect of the initial conditions and of stellar feedback
on the evolution of the galactic magnetic field in isolated, Milky-Way-like galaxies. The models
start with an ordered, either poloidal or toroidal, magnetic field of varying strength, and are
evolved with and without supernova feedback. They include a dark matter halo, a stellar and a gaseous
disk, as well as the appropriate cooling and heating processes for the interstellar medium. Independently
of the initial conditions, the galaxies develop a turbulent velocity field and a random magnetic
field component in under 15 Myrs. Supernova feedback is extremely efficient in building a random
magnetic field component up to large galactic heights. However, a random magnetic field emerges
even in runs without feedback, which points to an inherent instability of the ordered component.
Supernova feedback greatly affects the velocity field of the galaxy up to large galactic heights,
and helps restructure the magnetic field up to 10 kpc above the disk, independently of the initial
magnetic field morphology. On the other hand, the initial morphology of the magnetic field can accelerate
the development of a random component at large heights. These effects have important implications
for the study of the magnetic field evolution in galaxy simulations.
