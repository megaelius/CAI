We report deep spectroscopy of ten planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) using the
10.4m GTC. Our targets reside in different regions of M31, including halo streams and dwarf satellite
M32, and kinematically deviate from the extended disk. The temperature-sensitive [O III] 4363
auroral line is observed in all targets. For four PNe, the GTC spectra extend beyond 1 micron, enabling
explicit detection of the [S III] 6312 and 9069,9531 lines and thus determination of the [S III] temperature.
Abundance ratios are derived and generally consistent with AGB model predictions. Our PNe probably
all evolved from low-mass (<2 M_sun) stars, as analyzed with the most up-to-date post-AGB evolutionary
models, and their main-sequence ages are mostly ~2-5 Gyr. Compared to the underlying, smooth, metal-poor
halo of M31, our targets are uniformly metal-rich ([O/H]> -0.4), and seem to resemble the younger
population in the stream. We thus speculate that our halo PNe formed in the Giant Stream's progenitor
through extended star formation. Alternatively, they might have formed from the same metal-rich
gas as did the outer-disk PNe, but was displaced into their present locations as a result of galactic
interactions. These interpretations are, although speculative, qualitatively in line with the
current picture, as inferred from previous wide-field photometric surveys, that M31's halo is
the result of complex interactions and merger processes. The behavior of N/O of the combined sample
of the outer-disk and our halo/substructure PNe signifies that hot bottom burning might actually
occur at <3 M_sun, but careful assessment is needed.
