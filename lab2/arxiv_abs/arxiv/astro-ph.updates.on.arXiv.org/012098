The precision of recent experiments such as ${\it Planck}$ have allowed us to constrain standard
and non-standard physics (e.g., due to dark matter annihilation or varying fundamental constants)
during the recombination epoch. However, we can also probe this era of cosmic history using model-independent
variations of the free electron fraction, $X_{\rm e}$, which in turn affects the temperature and
polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background. In this paper, we improve on the
previous efforts to construct and constrain these generalised perturbations in the ionization
history, deriving new optimized eigenmodes based on the full Planck 2015 likelihood data, introducing
the new module 'FEARec++'. We develop a direct likelihood sampling method for attaining the numerical
derivatives of the standard and non-standard parameters, and discuss complications arising from
the stability of the likelihood code. We improve the amplitude constraints of the ${\it Planck}$
2015 principal components constructed here, $\mu_1=-0.09\pm0.12$, $\mu_2=-0.17\pm0.20$ and
$\mu_3=-0.30\pm0.35$, finding no indication for departures from the standard recombination
scenario. The third mode error is reduced by $60\%$. We utilise an efficient eigen-analyser that
keeps the cross-correlations of the first three eigenmodes to $\xi_{\mu,\mu'}<0.1\%$ after marginalisation
for all the considered data combinations. We also propose a new projection method for estimating
constraints on the parameters of non-standard recombination. Using our eigenmodes, this allows
us to recreate the ${\it Planck}$ constraint on the two-photon decay rate, $A_{\rm 2s1s}=7.60\pm0.64$,
giving an estimate to within $\simeq 0.05\sigma$ of the full MCMC result. The improvements on the
analysis using the ${\it Planck}$ data will allow us to implement this new method for analysis with
fundamental constant variations in the future.
