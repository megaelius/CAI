We present new, contemporaneous HST STIS and XMM observations of the O7 III(n)((f)) star xi Per.
We supplement the new data with archival IUE spectra, to analyze the variability of the wind lines
and X-ray flux of xi Pper. The variable wind of this star is known to have a 2.086 day periodicity. We
use a simple, heuristic spot model which fits the low velocity (near surface) IUE wind line variability
very well, to demonstrate that the low velocity absorption in the new STIS spectra of N IV 1718 and
Si IV 1402 vary with the same 2.086 day period. It is remarkable that the period and amplitude of the
STIS data agree with those of the IUE spectra obtained 22 years earlier. We also show that the time
variability of the new XMM fluxes are also consistent with the 2.086 day period. Thus, our new, multi-wavelength
coordinated observations demonstrate that the mechanism which causes the UV wind line variability
is also responsible for a significant fraction of the X-rays in single O stars. The sequence of events
for the multi-wavelength light curve minima is: Si IV 1402, N IV 1718, and X-ray flux, each separated
by a phase of about 0.06 relative to the 2.086 day period. Analysis of the X-ray fluxes shows that they
become softer as they weaken. This is contrary to expectations if the variability is caused by periodic
excess absorption. Further, the high resolution X-ray spectra suggest that the individual emission
lines at maximum are more strongly blue shifted. If we interpret the low velocity wind line light
curves in terms of our model, it implies that there are two bright regions, i.e., regions with less
absorption, separated by 180 deg, on the surface of the star. We note that the presence and persistent
of two spots separated by 180 deg suggests that a weak dipole magnetic field is responsible for the
variability of the UV wind line absorption and X-ray flux in xi Per.
