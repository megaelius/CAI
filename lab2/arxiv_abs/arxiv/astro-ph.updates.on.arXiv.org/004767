Since the discovery of an ice-particle plume erupting from the south polar terrain on Saturn's moon
Enceladus (Porco et al., 2006; Spahn et al., 2006; Spencer et al., 2006), the geophysical mechanisms
driving its activity have been the focus of substantial scientific research. The pattern and deposition
rate of plume material on Enceladus' surface is of interest because it provides valuable information
about the dynamics of the ice particle ejection as well as the surface erosion. Surface deposition
maps derived from numerical plume simulations by Kempf et al. (2010) have been used by various researchers
to interpret data obtained by various Cassini instruments. Here, an updated and detailed set of
deposition maps is provided based on a deep-source plume model (Schmidt et al., 2008), for the eight
ice-particle jets identified in Spitale and Porco (2007), the updated set of jets proposed in Porco
et al. (2014), and a contrasting curtain-style plume proposed in Spitale et al. (2015). Methods
for computing the surface deposition are detailed, and the structure of surface deposition patterns
is shown to be consistent across changes in the production rate and size distribution of the plume.
Images are also provided of the surface deposition structure originating in each of the four Tiger
Stripes. Finally, the differing approaches used in Porco et al. (2014) and Spitale et al. (2015)
have given rise to a jets vs. curtains controversy regarding the emission structure of the Enceladus
plume. Here we simulate each, leading to new insight that, over time, most emissions must be directed
relatively orthogonal to the surface because jets "tilted" significantly away from orthogonal
lead to surface deposition patterns inconsistent with surface images.
