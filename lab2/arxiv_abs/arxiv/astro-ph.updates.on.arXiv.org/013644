There is evidence that most chains of mean motion resonances of type $k$:$k-1$ among exoplanets
become unstable once the dissipative action from the gas is removed from the system, particularly
for large $N$ (the number of planets) and $k$ (indicating how compact the chain is). We present a novel
dynamical mechanism that can explain the origin of these instabilities and thus the dearth of resonant
systems in the exoplanet sample. It relies on the emergence of secondary resonances between a fraction
of the synodic frequency $2 \pi (1/P_1-1/P_2)$ and the libration frequencies in the mean motion
resonance. These secondary resonances excite the amplitudes of libration of the mean motion resonances
thus leading to an instability. We detail the emergence of these secondary resonances by carrying
out an explicit perturbative scheme to second order in the planetary masses and isolating the harmonic
terms that are associated with them. Focusing on the case of three planets in the 3:2 -- 3:2 mean motion
resonance as an example, a simple but general analytical model of one of these resonances is obtained
which describes the initial phase of the activation of one such secondary resonance. The dynamics
of the excited system is also briefly described. This scheme shows how one can obtain analytical
insight into the emergence of these resonances, and into the dynamics that they trigger. Finally,
a generalisation of this dynamical mechanism is obtained for arbitrary $N$ and $k$. This leads to
an explanation of previous numerical experiments on the stability of resonant chains, showing
why the critical planetary mass allowed for stability decreases with increasing $N$ and $k$.
