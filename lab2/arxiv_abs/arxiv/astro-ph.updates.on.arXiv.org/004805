Least-processed carbonaceous chondrites (carbonaceous chondrites that have experienced minimal
aqueous alteration and thermal metamorphism) are characterized by their predominately amorphous
iron-rich silicate interchondrule matrices and chondrule rims. The presence of abundant amorphous
material in a meteorite indicates that the parent body, or at least a region of the parent body, experienced
minimal processing since the time of accretion. The CO chemical group of carbonaceous chondrites
has a significant number of these least-processed samples. We present visible/near-infrared
and mid-infrared spectra of eight least-processed CO meteorites (petrologic type 3.0-3.1). In
the visible/near-infrared, these COs are characterized by a broad weak feature that was first observed
by Cloutis et al. (2012) to be at 1.3-um and attributed to iron-rich amorphous silicate matrix materials.
This feature is observed to be centered at 1.4-um for terrestrially unweathered, least-processed
CO meteorites. At mid-infrared wavelengths, a 21-um feature, consistent with Si-O vibrations
of amorphous materials and glasses, is also present. This spectral signature is absent in both the
near- and mid-infrared spectra of higher metamorphic grade COs because this material has recrystallized
as crystalline olivine. Furthermore, spectra of least-processed primitive meteorites from other
chemical groups (CRs, MET 00426 and QUE 99177, and C2-ungrouped Acfer 094), also exhibit a 21-um
feature. Thus, we conclude that the 1.4- and 21-umm features are characteristic of primitive least-processed
meteorites from all chemical groups of carbonaceous chondrites. Finally, we present an IRTF+SPeX
observation of asteroid (93) Minerva that has spectral similarities in the visible/near-infrared
to the least-processed CO carbonaceous chondrites. Minerva is likely the least-processed CO-like
asteroid observed to date.
