The formation of high-mass stars is tightly linked to that of their parental clouds. We here focus
on the high-density parts of W43, a molecular cloud undergoing an efficient event of formation.
The cloud structure is studied with a column density image derived from Herschel continuum maps
obtained at 70, 160, 250, 350, and 500 micron. We identify two high-column density filamentary clouds,
quoted as the W43-MM1 and W43-MM2 ridges, which both account for 1.5x10^4 Msun gas mass above 10^23
cm-2 and within areas of 5 and 14pc^2, respectively. We used the N_2H^+ 1--0 line to confirm that the
W43-MM1 and W43-MM2 ridges are structures coherent in velocity and gravitationally bound, despite
their large velocity dispersion and ~5 kms line widths. The most intriguing result of the W43 large
program is the bright wide-spread SiO~2--1 emission: 1--11~K kms$ stretching an area of ~28~pc^2.
Concentrated toward the W43-MM1 and W43-MM2 ridges and their immediate surroundings, it leads
to a total luminosity of L_SiO 2-1 ~4 10^4 K kms kpc^2pc^2. We measured a steep relation between the
luminosity and velocity extent of the SiO~2--1 lines and propose to use it to distinguish the low-velocity
shocks observed here from the more classical high-velocity ones associated with outflows of high-mass
young stellar objects. We used state-of-the-art shock models to demonstrate that low-velocity
(<10 kms^-1) shocks with a small amount (10\%) of Si atoms initially in gas phase or in grain mantles
can explain the observed SiO column density in W43. The spatial and velocity overlaps between the
ridges high-density gas (n_H2>10^4-10^5 cm^-3) and the shocked SiO gas suggests that ridges
could be forming via colliding flows driven by gravity and accompanied by low-velocity shocks.
This mechanism may be the initial conditions for the formation of young massive clusters in these
ridges.
