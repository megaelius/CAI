We present here a reanalysis of the Spitzer Space Telescope phase curves of the hot Jupiter WASP43
b, using the wavelet pixel-Independent Component Analysis, a blind signal-source separation
method. The data analyzed were recorded with the InfraRed Array Camera and consisted of two visits
at 3.6 $\mu$m, and one visit at 4.5 $\mu$m, each visit covering one transit and two eclipse events.
To test the robustness of our technique we repeated the analysis on smaller portions of the phase
curves, and by employing different instrument ramp models. Our reanalysis presents significant
updates of the planetary parameters compared to those reported in the original phase curve study
of WASP43 b. In particular, we found (1) higher nightside temperatures, (2) smaller hotspot offsets,
(3) a greater consistency ($\sim$1 $\sigma$) between the two 3.6~$\mu$m visits, and (4) a greater
similarity with the predictions of the atmospheric circulation models. Our parameter results
are consistent within 1 $\sigma$ with those reported by a recent reanalysis of the same data sets.
For each visit we studied the variation of the retrieved transit parameters as a function of various
sets of stellar limb-darkening coefficients, finding significant degeneracy between the limb-darkening
models and the analysis output. Furthermore, we performed the analysis of the single transit and
eclipse events, and we examined the differences between these results with the ones obtained with
the whole phase curve. Finally we provide a formula useful to optimize the trade-off between precision
and duration of observations of transiting exoplanets.
