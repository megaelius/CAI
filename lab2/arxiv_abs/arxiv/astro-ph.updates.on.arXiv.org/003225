Based on systematic analyses of several popular non-relativistic energy density functionals
with mean-field approximation, we estimate the value of the fourth-order symmetry energy $E_{\text{sym,4}}(\rho)$
at nuclear normal density $\rho_0$ and its density dependence, and explore the correlation between
$E_{\text{sym,4}}(\rho_0)$ and other macroscopic quantities of nuclear matter properties.
We use the empirical values of some nuclear macroscopic quantities to construct model parameter
sets by Monte Carlo method for the conventional Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) model, the extended
Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (eSHF) model, the Gogny-Hartree-Fock (GHF) model, and the momentum-dependent
interaction (MDI) model. The value of $E_{\text{sym,4}}(\rho_0)$ is estimated to be $1.02\pm0.49$
MeV for the SHF model, $1.01\pm0.53$ MeV for the eSHF model, $0.70\pm0.60$ MeV for the GHF model,
and $0.74\pm0.63$ MeV for the MDI model. Moreover, our results indicate that the density dependence
of $E_{\text{sym,4}}(\rho)$ is model dependent, especially at higher densities. Furthermore,
we find that the $E_{\text{sym},4}(\rho_0)$ has strong positive (negative) correlation with
isoscalar (isovector) nucleon effective mass $m_{s,0}^*$ ($m_{v,0}^*$) at $\rho_0$. In particular,
for the SHF and eSHF models, the $E_{\text{sym,4}}(\rho)$ is completely determined by the isoscalar
and isovector nucleon effective masses $m_{s}^*(\rho)$ and $m_{v}^*(\rho)$, and the analytical
expression is given. In the mean-field models, the magnitude of $ E_{\text{sym,4}}(\rho_0)$ is
generally less than $2$ MeV, and its density dependence depends on models, especially at higher
densities. $ E_{\text{sym,4}}(\rho_0)$ is strongly correlated with $m_{s,0}^*$ and $m_{v,0}^*$.
