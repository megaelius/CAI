We investigate the detectability of atmospheric spectral features of Earth-like planets in the
habitable zone (HZ) around M dwarfs with the future James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We use a coupled
1D climate-chemistry-model to simulate the influence of a range of observed and modelled M-dwarf
spectra on Earth-like planets. The simulated atmospheres served as input for the calculation of
the transmission spectra of the hypothetical planets, using a line-by-line spectral radiative
transfer model. To investigate the spectroscopic detectability of absorption bands with JWST
we further developed a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) model and applied it to our transmission spectra.
High abundances of CH$_4$ and H$_2$O in the atmosphere of Earth-like planets around mid to late M
dwarfs increase the detectability of the corresponding spectral features compared to early M-dwarf
planets. Increased temperatures in the middle atmosphere of mid- to late-type M-dwarf planets
expand the atmosphere and further increase the detectability of absorption bands. To detect CH$_4$,
H$_2$O, and CO$_2$ in the atmosphere of an Earth-like planet around a mid to late M dwarf observing
only one transit with JWST could be enough up to a distance of 4 pc and less than ten transits up to a distance
of 10 pc. As a consequence of saturation limits of JWST and less pronounced absorption bands, the
detection of spectral features of hypothetical Earth-like planets around most early M dwarfs would
require more than ten transits. We identify 276 existing M dwarfs (including GJ 1132, TRAPPIST-1,
GJ 1214, and LHS 1140) around which atmospheric absorption features of hypothetical Earth-like
planets could be detected by co-adding just a few transits. We show that using transmission spectroscopy,
JWST could provide enough precision to be able to partly characterise the atmosphere of Earth-like
TESS planets around mid to late M dwarfs.
