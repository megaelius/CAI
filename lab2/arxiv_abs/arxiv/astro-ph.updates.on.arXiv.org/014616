This paper presents a numerical application of a self-consistent theory of partial redistribution
in non-LTE conditions, developed in previous papers of the series. The code was described in a previous
paper of this series. However, in that previous paper (number IV of the series), the numerical results
were unrealistic. The present paper presents an approximation, which was able to restore the reliability
of the outgoing polarization profiles. The convergence of the results is also proved. It is demonstrated
that the step increment decreases like 1/N^a, with a > 1, so that the results series behaves like a
Riemann series, which is absolutely convergent. However, agreement between the computed and observed
linear polarization profiles remains qualitative only. The discrepancy is assigned to the plane
parallel atmosphere model, which is insufficient to describe the chromosphere, where these lines
are formed. As all the integrals are numerical in the code, it could probably be adapted to more realistic
and higher dimensioned model atmospheres. However, it is time consuming for lines having an hyperfine
structure as the Na I D lines are. The net linear polarization observed in Na I D1 with the polarimeter
ZIMPOL mounted on the McMath-Pierce telescope at Kitt Peak is not confirmed by the present calculations
and could be an artefact of instrumental polarization. The presence of instrumental polarization
could be confirmed by the higher linear polarization degree observed by this instrument in Na I D2
line center, with respect to the present calculation result, where the magnetic field is not accounted
for, when the Hanle effect acts as a depolarizing effect in the Second Solar Spectrum. The observed
linear polarization excess is found of the same order of magnitude 0.1% in both line centers, which
is also comparable to the instrumental polarization compensation level of this experiment.
