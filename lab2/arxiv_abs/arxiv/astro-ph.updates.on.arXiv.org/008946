Over the past decade, research in resolved stellar populations has made great strides in exploring
the nature of dark matter, in unraveling the star formation, chemical enrichment, and dynamical
histories of the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, and in probing fundamental physics from general
relativity to the structure of stars. Large surveys have been particularly important to the biggest
of these discoveries. In the coming decade, current and planned surveys will push these research
areas still further through a large variety of discovery spaces, giving us unprecedented views
into the low surface brightness Universe, the high surface brightness Universe, the 3D motions
of stars, the time domain, and the chemical abundances of stellar populations. These discovery
spaces will be opened by a diverse range of facilities, including the continuing Gaia mission, imaging
machines like LSST and WFIRST, massively multiplexed spectroscopic platforms like DESI, Subaru-PFS,
and MSE, and telescopes with high sensitivity and spatial resolution like JWST, the ELTs, and LUVOIR.
We do not know which of these facilities will prove most critical for resolved stellar populations
research in the next decade. We can predict, however, that their chance of success will be maximized
by granting use of the data to broad communities, that many scientific discoveries will draw on a
combination of data from them, and that advances in computing will enable increasingly sophisticated
analyses of the large and complex datasets that they will produce. We recommend that Astro2020 1)
acknowledge the critical role that data archives will play for stellar populations and other science
in the next decade, 2) recognize the opportunity that advances in computing will bring for survey
data analysis, and 3) consider investments in Science Platform technology to bring these opportunities
to fruition.
