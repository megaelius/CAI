The presence of matter in the path of relic photons causes distortions in the angular pattern of the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations, modifying their properties in a
slight but measurable way. Recently, the Planck Collaboration released the estimated convergence
map, an integrated measure of the large-scale matter distribution that produced the weak gravitational
lensing (WL) phenomenon observed in Planck CMB data. We perform exhaustive analyses of this convergence
map calculating the variance in small and large regions of the sky, but excluding the area masked
due to galactic contaminations, and compare them with the features expected in the set of simulated
convergence maps, also released by the Planck collaboration. Our goal is to search for sky directions
or regions where the WL imprints anomalous signatures to the variance estimator revealed through
a $\chi^2$ analyses at a statistically significant level. In the local analysis of the Planck convergence
map we identified 8 patches of the sky in disagreement, in more than 2$\sigma$, with what is observed
in the average of the simulations. In contrast, in the large regions analysis we found no statistically
significant discrepancies, but, interestingly, the regions with the highest $\chi^2$ values
are surrounding the ecliptic poles. Thus, our results show a good agreement with the features expected
by the $\Lambda$CDM concordance model, as given by the simulations. Yet, the outliers regions found
here could suggest that the data still contain residual contamination, like noise, due to over-
or under-estimation of systematic effects in the simulation data set.
