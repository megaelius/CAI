We present the remarkable discovery that the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 2366 is an excellent analog
of the Green Pea (GP) galaxies, which are characterized by extremely high ionization parameters.
The similarities are driven predominantly by the giant H II region Markarian 71 (Mrk 71). We compare
the system with GPs in terms of morphology, excitation properties, specific star-formation rate,
kinematics, absorption of low-ionization species, reddening, and chemical abundance, and find
consistencies throughout. Since extreme GPs are associated with both candidate and confirmed
Lyman continuum (LyC) emitters, Mrk 71/NGC 2366 is thus also a good candidate for LyC escape. The
spatially resolved data for this object show a superbubble blowout generated by mechanical feedback
from one of its two super star clusters (SSCs), Knot B, while the extreme ionization properties are
driven by the <1 Myr-old, enshrouded SSC Knot A, which has ~ 10 times higher ionizing luminosity.
Very massive stars (> 100 Msun) may be present in this remarkable object. Ionization-parameter
mapping indicates the blowout region is optically thin in the LyC, and the general properties also
suggest LyC escape in the line of sight. Mrk 71/NGC 2366 does differ from GPs in that it is 1 - 2 orders
of magnitude less luminous. The presence of this faint GP analog and candidate LyC emitter (LCE)
so close to us suggests that LCEs may be numerous and commonplace, and therefore could significantly
contribute to the cosmic ionizing budget. Mrk 71/NGC 2366 offers an unprecedentedly detailed look
at the viscera of a candidate LCE, and could clarify the mechanisms of LyC escape.
