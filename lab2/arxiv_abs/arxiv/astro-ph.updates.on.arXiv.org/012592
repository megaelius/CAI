Galaxies forming in low-mass halos are thought to be primarily responsible for reionizing the Universe
during the first billion years after the Big Bang. Yet, these halos are extremely inefficient at
forming stars in the nearby Universe. In this work, we address this apparent tension, and ask whether
a physically motivated model of galaxy formation that reproduces the observed abundance of faint
galaxies in the nearby Universe is also consistent with available observational constraints on
the reionization history. By interfacing the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model for galaxy formation
with an analytic reionization model, we constructed a computationally efficient pipeline that
connects `ground-level' galaxy formation physics to `top-level' cosmological-scale observables.
Based on photometric properties of the galaxy populations predicted up to $z=15$, we compute the
reionization history of intergalactic hydrogen. We quantify the three degenerate quantities
that influence the total ionizing photon budget, including the abundance of galaxies, the intrinsic
production rate of ionizing photons, and the LyC escape fraction. We explore covariances between
these quantities using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. We find that our locally calibrated model
is consistent with all currently available constraints on the reionization history, under reasonable
assumptions about the LyC escape fraction. We quantify the fraction of ionizing photons contributed
by galaxies of different luminosities and find that the galaxies expected to be detected in JWST
NIRCam wide and deep surveys are responsible for producing $\sim 40$-$80\%$ of ionizing photons
throughout the EoR. All results presented in this work are available at https://www.simonsfoundation.org/semi-analytic-forecasts-for-jwst/.
