Retrograde-propagating waves of vertical vorticity with longitudinal wavenumbers between 3
and 15 have been observed on the Sun with a dispersion relation close to that of classical sectoral
Rossby waves. The observed vorticity eigenfunctions are symmetric in latitude, peak at the equator,
switch sign near $20^\circ$-$30^\circ$, and decrease at higher latitudes. We search for an explanation
that takes into account solar latitudinal differential rotation. In the equatorial $\beta$ plane,
we study the propagation of linear Rossby waves (phase speed $c <0$) in a parabolic zonal shear flow,
$U = - \overline{U}\ \xi^2<0$, where $\overline{U} = 244$ m/s and $\xi$ is the sine of latitude. In
the inviscid case, the eigenvalue spectrum is real and continuous and the velocity stream functions
are singular at the critical latitudes where $U = c$. We add eddy viscosity in the problem to account
for wave attenuation. In the viscous case, the stream functions are solution of a fourth-order modified
Orr-Sommerfeld equation. Eigenvalues are complex and discrete. For reasonable values of the eddy
viscosity corresponding to supergranular scales and above (Reynolds number $100 \le Re \le 700$),
all modes are stable. At fixed longitudinal wavenumber, the least damped mode is a symmetric mode
with a real frequency close to that of the classical Rossby mode, which we call the R mode. For $Re \approx
300$, the attenuation and the real part of the eigenfunction is in qualitative agreement with the
observations (unlike the imaginary part of the eigenfunction, which has a larger amplitude in the
model. Conclusion: Each longitudinal wavenumber is associated with a latitudinally symmetric
R mode trapped at low latitudes by solar differential rotation. In the viscous model, R modes transport
significant angular momentum from the dissipation layers towards the equator.
