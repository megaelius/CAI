We investigate how the way galaxies acquire their gas across cosmic time in cosmological hydrodynamic
simulations is modified by a comprehensive physical model for baryonic feedback processes. To
do so, we compare two simulations -- with and without feedback -- both evolved with the moving mesh
code AREPO. The feedback runs implement the full physics model of the Illustris simulation project,
including star formation driven galactic winds and energetic feedback from supermassive blackholes.
We explore: (a) the accretion rate of material contributing to the net growth of galaxies and originating
directly from the intergalactic medium, finding that feedback strongly suppresses the raw, as
well as the net, inflow of this "smooth mode" gas at all redshifts, regardless of the temperature
history of newly acquired gas. (b) At the virial radius the temperature and radial flux of inflowing
gas is largely unaffected at z=2. However, the spherical covering fraction of inflowing gas at 0.25
rvir decreases substantially, from more than 80% to less than 50%, while the rates of both inflow
and outflow increase, indicative of recycling across this boundary. (c) The fractional contribution
of smooth accretion to the total accretion rate is lower in the simulation with feedback, by roughly
a factor of two across all redshifts. Moreover, the smooth component of gas with a cold temperature
history, is entirely suppressed in the feedback run at z<1. (d) The amount of time taken by gas
to cross from the virial radius to the galaxy -- the "halo transit time" -- increases in the presence
of feedback by a factor of ~2-3, and is notably independent of halo mass. We discuss the possible implications
of this invariance for theoretical models of hot halo gas cooling.
