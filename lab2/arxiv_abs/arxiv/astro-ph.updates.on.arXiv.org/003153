Verlinde derived gravity as an emergent force from the information flow, through two-dimensional
surfaces and recently, by a priori postulating the entanglement of information in 3D space, he derived
the effect of the gravitational potential from dark matter (DM) as the entropy displacement of dark
energy by baryonic matter. In Emergent Gravity (EG) this apparent DM depends only on the baryonic
mass distribution and the present-day value of the Hubble parameter. In this paper we test the EG
proposition, formalized by Verlinde for a spherical and isolated mass distribution, using the
central velocity dispersion, $\sigma$ and the light distribution in a sample of 4260 massive and
local early-type galaxies (ETGs) from the SPIDER sample. Our results remain unaltered if we consider
the sample of 807 roundest field galaxies. We derive the predictions by EG for the stellar mass-to-light
ratio (M/L) and the Initial Mass Function (IMF), and compare them with the same inferences derived
from a) DM-based models, b) MOND and c) stellar population models. We demonstrate that, consistently
with a classical Newtonian framework with a DM halo component, or alternative theories of gravity
as MOND, the central dynamics can be fitted if the IMF is assumed non-universal. The results can be
interpreted with a IMF lighter than a standard Chabrier at low-$\sigma$, and bottom-heavier IMFs
at larger $\sigma$. We find lower, but still acceptable, stellar M/L in EG theory, if compared with
the DM-based NFW model and with MOND. The results from EG are comparable to what is found if the DM haloes
are adiabatically contracted and with expectations from spectral gravity-sensitive features.
If the strain caused by the entropy displacement would be not maximal, as adopted in the current formulation,
then the dynamics of ETGs could be reproduced with larger M/L. (abridged)
