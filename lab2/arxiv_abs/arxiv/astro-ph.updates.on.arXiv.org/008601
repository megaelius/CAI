The present document outlines a roadmap for future developments that will significantly expand
ALMA's capabilities and enable it to produce even more exciting science in the coming decades. The
proposed developments are motivated by the groundbreaking results achieved by ALMA during its
first five years of operation. The roadmap described here is based on input on new scientific directions
and technical feasibility of future developments from the ALMA Science Advisory Committee (ASAC),
the community, and technical documents. The Working Group recommends that the top development
priority, based on scientific merit and technical feasibility, is to broaden the receiver IF bandwidth
by at least a factor two, and to upgrade the associated electronics and correlator. These developments
will advance a wide range of scientific studies by significantly reducing the time required for
blind redshift surveys, chemical spectral scans, and deep continuum surveys. In order of scientific
priority, receiver upgrades are recommended for intermediate (200-425 GHz), low (< 200 GHz), and
high (> 425 GHz) frequencies. The Working Group recommends that the receiver and throughput developments
proceed as soon as fiscally and technically feasible. As a first step, a technical and scientific
group should be formed to formalize the top-level requirements. A team of systems engineers should
then be charged with flowing these requirements down to the subsystems to form a consistent new set
of minimum requirements, which future development projects would have to meet. Given that upgrading
the throughput will impact many ALMA subsystems, the Working Group recommends that a team within
ALMA be charged with coordinating and monitoring these developments. (Abbreviated)
