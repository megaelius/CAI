Total solar eclipse (TSE) coronal large and small scale events were reported in the historical literature
but a definite synoptic coverage was missing for studying a relationship with the more general magnetic
context of the solar-disk. We here analyze temporal changes in the solar corona before, during,
and after the total solar eclipse on 21 August 2017 from a set of ground-based and of space-borne observations.
High-quality ground-based white-light (W-L) observations and a deep image processing allow us
to reveal these changes for the first time with a fraction of a one-minute time resolution. Displacements
of a number of fine coronal features were measured for the first time at these small radial distances,
using a diffraction limited instrument at a single site. The comparison with space-based observations,
including observations from the {\it Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory} (STEREO) mission,
showed that the features belong to a slow coronal mass ejection (CME) propagating through the corona
with the nearly constant speed of 250 km/s. Our TSE images provide the same typical velocity as measured
at a distance of one solar radius from the surface. The event was initiated by coronal dynamics manifested
by a prominence eruption that started just before the eclipse observations and an ascent of a U-shaped
structure visible in the AIA 171 A channel, which we assume as the lower part of a coronal cavity. The
prominence material was observed draining down towards the chromosphere along the prominence
arch. While the prominence disappears in the STEREO-A field-of-view at the height of about 6$^{\prime}$
above the limb, the corresponding flux rope seems to continue towards the outer corona and produces
the slow CME with turbulent motion. The overall mass of the moving features is evaluated based on
absolute photometrical data extracted from our best W-L eclipse image.
