The intrinsic X-ray emission of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) is often found to be absorbed over and above
the column density through our own galaxy. The extra component is usually assumed to be due to absorbing
gas lying within the host galaxy of the GRB itself. There is an apparent correlation between the equivalent
column density of hydrogen, N(H,intrinsic) (assuming it to be at the GRB redshift), and redshift,
z, with the few z>6 GRBs showing the greatest intrinsic column densities. We investigate the
N(H,intrinsic) - z relation using a large sample of Swift GRBs, as well as active galactic nuclei
(AGN) and quasar samples, paying particular attention to the spectral energy distributions of
the two highest redshift GRBs. Various possible sample biases and systematics that might produce
such a correlation are considered, and we conclude that the correlation is very likely to be real.
This may indicate either an evolutionary effect in the host galaxy properties, or a contribution
from gas along the line-of-sight, in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) or intervening absorbing
clouds. Employing a more realistic model for IGM absorption than in previous works, we find that
this may explain much of the observed opacity at z>~3 providing it is not too hot, likely between
10^5 K and 10^6.5 K, and moderately metal enriched, Z~0.2 Z_sun. This material could therefore constitute
the Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium. However, a comparable level of absorption is also expected from
the cumulative effect of intervening cold gas clouds, and given current uncertainties it is not
possible to say which, if either, dominates. At lower redshifts, we conclude that gas in the host
galaxies must be the dominant contributor to the observed X-ray absorption.
