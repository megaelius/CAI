Analysis of high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of early-type magnetic stars
is currently the most advanced method of obtaining detailed information on their surface magnetic
field topologies and horizontal spot distributions. In this study we analyse a new set of high-quality
four Stokes parameter observations of the magnetic Ap star HD119419 - a member of the 14 Myr old Lower
Cen-Cru association - for the purpose of studying the surface field topology and mapping the chemical
abundance spots. We made use of the circular and linear polarisation data collected for HD119419
with the HARPSpol instrument at the ESO 3.6-m telescope. These observations were analysed with
a multi-line magnetic diagnostic technique and modelled in detail with a Magnetic Doppler imaging
code. We present a new set of mean longitudinal magnetic field measurements and derive a revised
stellar rotational period. We also redetermine the basic stellar atmospheric parameters. Our
four Stokes parameter magnetic inversions reveal a moderately complex surface field topology
with a mean field strength of 18 kG and a maximum local strength of 24 kG. A poloidal dipolar component
dominates the magnetic energy spectrum of the surface field in HD119419. However, significant
contributions of the higher-order spherical harmonic components are also present. We show that
the dipole plus quadrupole part of the reconstructed field geometry is incapable of reproducing
the observed amplitudes and shapes of the Stokes Q and U profiles. The chemical abundance distributions
of Fe, Cr, Ti, and Nd, derived self-consistently with the magnetic field geometry, are characterised
by large abundance gradients and a lack of clear correlation with the magnetic field structure.
This full Stokes vector analysis of HD119419 extends the modern hot-star magnetic mapping investigations
to an open cluster Ap star with a well-determined age.
