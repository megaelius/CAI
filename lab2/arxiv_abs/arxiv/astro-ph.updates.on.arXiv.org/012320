Superflares, as strong explosions on stars, have been well studied with the progress of space time-domain
astronomy. In this work, we present the study of superflares on solar-type stars using Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite ({\em{TESS}}) data. 13 sectors of observations during the first year
of the {\em TESS} mission have covered the southern hemisphere of the sky, containing 25,734 solar-type
stars. We verified 1,216 superflares on 400 solar-type stars through automatic search and visual
inspection with 2-minute cadence data. Our result suggests a higher superflare frequency distribution
than the result from {\em Kepler}. The reason may be that the majority of {\em TESS} solar-type stars
in our dataset are rapidly rotating stars. The power-law index $\gamma$ of the superflare frequency
distribution ($dN/dE\propto E^{-\gamma}$) is constrained to be $\gamma = 2.16\pm 0.10$, which
is a little larger than that of solar flares but consistent with the results from {\em Kepler}. Because
only 7 superflares of Sun-like stars are detected, we may not give a robust superflare occurrence
frequency. And four stars are accompanied by unconfirmed hot planet candidates. Therefore, superflares
are possibly caused by stellar magnetic activities instead of planet-star interactions. We also
find an extraordinary star TIC43472154, which exhibits about 200 superflares per year. In addition,
the correlation between energy and duration of superflares ($T_{\text {duration }} \propto E^{\beta}$)
is analyzed. We derive the power-law index to be $\beta=0.42\pm0.01$, which is a little larger than
$\beta=1/3$ from the prediction according to magnetic reconnection theory.
