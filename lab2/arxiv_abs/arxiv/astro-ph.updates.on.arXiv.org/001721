Stellar convection is customarily described by Mixing-Length Theory, which makes use of the mixing-length
scale to express the convective flux, velocity, and temperature gradients of the convective elements
and stellar medium. The mixing-length scale is taken to be proportional to the local pressure scale
height, and the proportionality factor (the mixing-length parameter) must be determined by comparing
the stellar models to some calibrator, usually the Sun. No strong arguments exist to suggest that
the mixing-length parameter is the same in all stars and at all evolutionary phases. Because of this,
all stellar models in literature are hampered by this basic uncertainty. The aim of this study is
to present a new theory of stellar convection that does not require the mixing length parameter.
We present a self-consistent analytical formulation of stellar convection that determines the
properties of stellar convection as a function of the physical behaviour of the convective elements
themselves and the surrounding medium. This new theory is formulated starting from a conventional
solution of the Navier-Stokes/Euler equations, i.e. the Bernoulli equation for a perfect fluid,
but expressed in a non-inertial reference frame co-moving with the convective elements. In our
formalism the motion of stellar convective cells inside convective- unstable layers is fully determined
by a new system of equations for convection in a non-local and time dependent formalism. We obtain
an analytical, non-local, time-dependent solution for the convective energy transport that does
not depend on any free parameter. The predictions of the new theory are compared with those from the
standard mixing-length paradigm for the most accurate calibrator, the Sun, with very satisfactory
results.
