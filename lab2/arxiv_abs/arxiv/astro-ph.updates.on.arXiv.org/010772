The WISSH quasars project aims at studying the nuclear and host galaxy properties of the most luminous
quasars ($L_{bol}>10^{47}$ erg/s, $1.8<z<4.6$). Nuclear winds are manifested as UV broad ($\geq$
2,000 km/s) absorption lines (BAL) in $\sim$ 15\% of quasars. We aim at studying the incidence and
properties of such winds in the WISSH sample, to investigate possible differences with respect
to lower luminosity AGN regimes. We collected optical spectra from the SDSS data release 12, and
identified those showing absorption troughs in the region between \siiv and \civ emission lines.
We find a higher observed fraction of \civ BAL quasars in the WISSH sample (24\%) with respect to previous
catalogues (10-15\%). These WISSH BAL quasars are also characterized by a larger average BI ($\sim$4,000
km/s) and maximum velocity ($\sim$17,000 km/s). Moreover, for two objects we discovered BAL features
bluewards of the \siiv peak, which can be associated to \civ absorption with velocity of 0.15c. Finally,
we updated previous studies on the dependence of maximum outflow velocity upon bolometric luminosity,
showing that BAL winds have intermediate properties compared to molecular/ionized winds and ultra
fast outflows (UFOs). Finally, the radio properties of the WISSH BAL quasars as a whole are in line
with those of samples at lower luminosities from previous studies. Our results suggest that the
higher $L_{\rm bol}$ of the WISSH quasars likely favours the acceleration of BAL outflows and that
their most likely driving mechanism is radiation pressure. Furthermore we estimate that the kinetic
power associated to these winds in hyperluminous quasars is sufficient, for the highest column
density and fastest winds, to provide efficient feedback onto the host galaxy.
