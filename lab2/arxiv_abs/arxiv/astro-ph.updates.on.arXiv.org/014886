We derive cosmological constraints on the matter density, \om, and the amplitude of fluctuations,
\sig, using $\mathtt{GalWCat19}$, a catalog of 1800 galaxy clusters we identified in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey-DR13 spectroscopic data set using our GalWeight technique to determine cluster
membership \citep{Abdullah18,Abdullah19}. By analyzing a subsample of 756 clusters in a redshift
range of $0.045\leq z \leq 0.125$ and virial masses of $M\geq 0.8\times10^{14}$ \hm ~with mean redshift
of $z = 0.085$, we obtain \om ~$=0.310^{+0.023}_{-0.027} \pm 0.041$ (systematic) and \sig ~$=0.810^{+0.031}_{-0.036}\pm
0.035$ (systematic), with a cluster normalization relation of $\sigma_8= 0.43 \Omega_m^{-0.55}$.
There are several unique aspects to our approach: we use the largest spectroscopic data set currently
available, and we assign membership using the GalWeight technique which we have shown to be very
effective at simultaneously maximizing the number of {\it{bona fide}} cluster members while minimizing
the number of contaminating interlopers. Moreover, rather than employing scaling relations,
we calculate cluster masses individually using the virial mass estimator. Since $\mathtt{GalWCat19}$
is a low-redshift cluster catalog we do not need to make any assumptions about evolution either in
cosmological parameters or in the properties of the clusters themselves. Our constraints on \om
~and \sig ~are consistent and very competitive with those obtained from non-cluster abundance
cosmological probes such as Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation
(BAO), and supernovae (SNe). The joint analysis of our cluster data with Planck18+BAO+Pantheon
gives \om ~$=0.315^{+0.013}_{-0.011}$ and \sig ~$=0.810^{+0.011}_{-0.010}$.
