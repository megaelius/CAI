Using observations from Solar Dynamics Observatory, we studied an interesting example of a sigmoid
formation and eruption from small-scale flux canceling regions of active region (AR) 11942. Analysis
of HMI and AIA observations infer that initially the AR is compact and bipolar in nature, evolved
to sheared configuration consisting of inverse J-shaped loops hosting a filament channel over
a couple of days. By tracking the photospheric magnetic features, shearing and converging motions
are observed to play a prime role in the development of S-shaped loops and further flux cancellation
leads to tether-cutting reconnection of J-loops. This phase is co-temporal with the filament rise
motion followed by sigmoid eruption at 21:32 UT on January 6. The flux rope rises in phases of slow
(v$_{avg}$ = 26 km~s$^{-1}$) and fast (a$_{avg}$= 55 ms$^{-2}$) rise motion categorizing the CME
as slow with an associated weak C1.0 class X-ray flare. The flare ribbon separation velocity peaks
at around peak time of the flare at which maximum reconnection rate (2.14 Vcm$^{-1}$) occurs. Further,
the EUV light-curves of 131, 171\AA~have delayed peaks of 130 minutes compared to 94\AA~and is explained
by differential emission measure. Our analysis suggests that the energy release is proceeded in
a much long time duration, manifesting the onset of filament rise and eventual eruption driven by
converging and canceling flux in the photosphere. Unlike strong eruption events, the observed
slow CME and weak flare are indications of slow runway tether-cutting reconnection where most of
the sheared arcade is relaxed during the extended post phase of the eruption.
