The Galaxy Zoo has provided morphological data on many galaxies. Several biases have been identified
in the Galaxy Zoo data. Here we report on a newly discovered selection effect: astronomers interested
in studying spiral galaxies may select a set of spiral galaxies based upon a threshold in spirality
(the fraction of Galaxy Zoo humans who report seeing spiral structure). SpArcFiRe is an automated
tool that decomposes a spiral galaxy into its constituent spiral arms, providing objective, quantitative
data on their structure. SpArcFiRe measures the pitch angle of spiral arms. We have observed that
when selecting a set of spiral galaxies based on a threshold on spirality, the pitch angle of spiral
arms appear increase with redshift. We hypothesize that this is a selection effect: tightly-wound
spiral arms become less visible as images degrade with increasing redshift, leading to fewer such
galaxies being included in the sample at higher redshifts. We corroborate this hypothesis by artificially
degrading images of nearby galaxies, then using a machine learning algorithm trained on Galaxy
Zoo data to provide a spirality for each artificially degraded image. It correctly predicts that
spirality decreases as image quality degrades. Thus, the mean pitch angle of those galaxies remaining
above the spirality threshold is higher than those eliminated by the selection effect. This demonstrates
that users who select samples of galaxies using a threshold of Galaxy Zoo votes must carefully consider
the possibility of selection effects on morphological measures, even if the measure itself is believed
to be objective and unbiased. Finally, we also perform an empirical sensitivity analysis to demonstrate
that SpArcFiRe's output changes in a smooth and predictable fashion to changes in its internal algorithmic
parameters.
