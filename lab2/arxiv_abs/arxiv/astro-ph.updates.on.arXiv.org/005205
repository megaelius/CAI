We propose a new data analysis method for obtaining transmission spectra of exoplanet atmospheres
and brightness variation across the stellar disk from transit observations. The new method is capable
of recovering exoplanet atmosphere absorption spectra and stellar specific intensities without
relying on theoretical models of stars and planets. We fit both stellar specific intensity and planetary
radius simultaneously directly to transit light curves. This allows stellar models to be removed
from the data analysis. Furthermore, we use a data-quality weighted filtering technique to achieve
an optimal trade-off between spectral resolution and reconstruction fidelity homogenising the
signal to noise ratio across the wavelength range. Such approach is more efficient than conventional
data binning onto a low resolution wavelength grid. We demonstrate that our analysis is capable
of re-producing results achieved by using explicit quadratic limb darkening equation, and that
the filtering technique helps eliminating spurious spectral features in regions with strong telluric
absorption. The method is applied to the VLT FORS2 observations of the exoplanets GJ 1214 b and WASP-49
b, and our results are in agreement with previous studies. Comparisons between obtained stellar
specific intensity and numerical models indicates that the method is capable of accurately reconstructing
the specific intensity. The proposed method enables more robust characterization of exoplanetary
atmospheres by separating derivation of planetary transmission and stellar specific intensity
spectra (that is model-independent) from chemical and physical interpretation.
