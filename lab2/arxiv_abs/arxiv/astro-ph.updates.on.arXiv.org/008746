We analyse a unique sample of 517 bright ($L>L^{*}$) LBGs at redshift z$\sim$3 in order to characterise
the distribution of their UV slopes $\beta$ and infer their dust extinction under standard assumptions.
We exploited multi-band observations over 750 arcmin$^2$ of the COSMOS field that were acquired
with three different ground-based facilities: the Large Binocular Camera (LBC) on the Large Binocular
Telescope (LBT), the Suprime-Cam on the SUBARU telescope, and the VIRCAM on the VISTA telescope
(ULTRAVISTA DR2). Our multi-band photometric catalogue is based on a new method that is designed
to maximise the signal-to-noise ratio in the estimate of accurate galaxy colours from images with
different point spread functions (PSF). We adopted an improved selection criterion based on deep
Y-band data to isolate a sample of galaxies at $z\sim 3 $ to minimise selection biases. We measured
the UV slopes ($\beta$) of the objects in our sample and then recovered the intrinsic probability
density function of $\beta$ values (PDF($\beta$)), taking into account the effect of observational
uncertainties through detailed simulations. The galaxies in our sample are characterised by mildly
red UV slopes with $<\beta>\simeq -1.70$ throughout the enitre luminosity range that is probed
by our data ($-24\lesssim M_{1600}\lesssim -21$). The resulting dust-corrected star formation
rate density (SFRD) is $log(SFRD)\simeq-1.6 M_{\odot}/yr/Mpc^{3}$, corresponding to a contribution
of about 25% to the total SFRD at z$\sim$3 under standard assumptions. Ultra-bright LBGs at $z \sim
3$ match the known trends, with UV slopes being redder at decreasing redshifts, and brighter galaxies
being more highly dust extinct and more frequently star-forming than fainter galaxies. [abridged]
