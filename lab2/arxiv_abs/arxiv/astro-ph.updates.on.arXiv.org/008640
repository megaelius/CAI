We perform a simulation using the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment of the Orion
Trapezium star cluster in which the evolution of the stars and the dynamics of planetary systems
are taken into account. The initial conditions are selected from earlier simulations in which the
size and mass distributions of the observed circum-stellar disks in this cluster are satisfactorily
reproduced. Four, five or size planets per star were introduced in orbit around the 500 solar-like
stars with a maximum orbital separation of 400\,au. Our study focuses on the production of free-floating
planets. From a total of 2522 planets in the initial conditions of the simulation, a total of 357 become
unbound. Of these, 281 leave the cluster within the crossing time-scale of the star cluster, the
others remain bound to the cluster as free-floating intra-cluster planets. Five of these free-floating
intra-cluster planets are captured at a later time by another star. The two main mechanisms by which
planets are lost from their host star, ejection upon a strong encounter with another star or internal
planetary scattering, drive the evaporation independently of planet mass of orbital separation
at birth. The effect of small perturbations due to slow changes in the cluster potential are important
for the evolution of planetary systems. In addition, the probability for a star losing a planet is
independent of the planet mass and independent of its initial orbital separation. As a consequence,
the mass-distribution of free-floating planets is indistinguishable from the mass distribution
of planets bound to their host star.
