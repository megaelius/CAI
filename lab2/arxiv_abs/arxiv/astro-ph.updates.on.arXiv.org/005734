Using the observations recorded by Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on-board the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO), the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Extreme-ultraviolet
Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) and X-Ray Telescope (XRT) both on-board Hinode, we present the evidence
of chromospheric evaporation in a coronal loop after the occurrence of two active region transient
brightenings (ARTBs) at the two footpoints. The chromospheric evaporation started nearly simultaneously
in all the three hot channels of AIA such as 131~{\AA}, 94~{\AA} and 335~{\AA}, which was observed
to be temperature dependent, being fastest in the highest temperature channel. The whole loop became
fully brightened following the ARTBs after $\approx25$~s in 131~{\AA}, $\approx 40$~s in 94~{\AA},
and $\approx 6.5$~min in 335~{\AA}. The DEM measurements at the two footpoints (i.e., of two ARTBs)
and the loop-top suggest that the plasma attained a maximum temperature of $\sim$10~MK at all these
locations. The spectroscopic observations from IRIS revealed the presence of redshifted emission
of $\sim$20~km~s$^{-1}$ in cooler lines like \ion{C}{2} and \ion{Si}{4} during the ARTBs that
was co-temporal with the evaporation flow at the footpoint of the loop. During the ARTBs, the line
width of \ion{C}{2} and \ion{Si}{4} increased nearly by a factor of two during the peak emission.
Moreover, enhancement in the line width preceded that in the Doppler shift which again preceded
enhancement in the intensity. The observed results were qualitatively reproduced by 1-D hydrodynamic
simulations where energy was deposited at both the footpoints of a monolithic coronal loop that
mimicked the ARTBs identified in the observations.
