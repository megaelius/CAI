Helioseismology and asteroseismology of red giant stars have shown that the distribution of angular
momentum in stellar interiors, and its evolution with time remains an open issue in stellar physics.
Owing to the unprecedented quality of Kepler photometry, we are able to seismically infer internal
rotation rates in \gamma Doradus stars, which provide the MS counterpart to the red-giants puzzle.
We confront these internal rotation rates to stellar evolution models with rotationally induced
transport of angular momentum, in order to test angular momentum transport mechanisms. We used
a stellar model-independent method developed by Christophe et al. in order to obtain seismically
inferred, buoyancy radii and near-core rotation for 37 \gamma Doradus stars observed by Kepler.
We show that the buoyancy radius can be used as a reliable evolution indicator for field stars on the
MS. We computed rotating evolutionary models including transport of angular momentum in radiative
zones, following Zahn and Maeder, with the CESTAM code. This code calculates the rotational history
of stars from the birth line to the tip of the RGB. The initial angular momentum content has to be set
initially, which is done by fitting rotation periods in young stellar clusters. We show a clear disagreement
between the near-core rotation rates measured in the sample and the rotation rates obtained from
evolutionary models including rotationally induced transport following Zahn (1992). These results
show a disagreement similar to that of the Sun and red giant stars. This suggests the existence of
missing mechanisms responsible for the braking of the core before and along the MS. The efficiency
of the missing mechanisms is investigated. The transport of angular momentum as formalized by Zahn
and Maeder cannot explain the measurements of near-core rotation in main-sequence intermediate-mass
stars we have at hand.
