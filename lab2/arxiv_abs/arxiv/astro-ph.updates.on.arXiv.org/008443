Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are transient sources that emit a single radio pulse with a duration of only
a few milliseconds. Since the discovery of the first FRB in 2007, tens of similar events have been
detected. However, their physical origin remains unclear, and a number of scenarios even larger
than the number of known FRBs has been proposed during these years. The presence of repeating bursts
in FRB 121102 allowed us to perform a precise localization of the source with the Very Large Array
and the European VLBI Network (EVN). Optical observations with Keck, Gemini and HST unveiled the
host to be a low-metallicity star-forming dwarf galaxy located at a redshift of 0.193. The EVN results
showed that the bursts are co-located (within a projected separation of $< 40$ pc) to a compact and
persistent radio source with a size of $< 0.7$ pc inside a star-forming region. This environment
resembles the ones where superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) or long gamma-ray bursts are produced.
Although the nature of this persistent source and the origin of the bursts remain unknown, scenarios
considering a pulsar/magnetar energizing a young SLSN, or a system with a pulsar/magnetar in the
vicinity of a massive black hole are the most plausible ones to date. More recent observations have
shown that the bursts from FRB 121102 are almost 100% linearly polarized at an unexpectedly high
and variable Faraday rotation measure, that has been observed to date only in vicinities of massive
black holes. The bursts are thus likely produced from a neutron star in such environment, although
the system can still be explained by a young neutron star embedded in a highly magnetized nebula.
Upcoming interferometric searches are expected to report tens of these localizations in the coming
years, unveil if this source is representative of the whole population or a particular case, and
dramatically boosting the field of FRBs.
