Screened modified gravity models are viable alternatives to dark energy for driving the accelerated
expansion of the Universe. They can exhibit complex behaviour on galactic and intergalactic scales,
where current constraints on gravity are relatively weak, without violating stringent Solar System
tests. In this work, we explore the viability of using the kinematics of galaxies to constrain screened
modified gravity models. We focus on chameleon f(R) gravity and predict its impact on galaxy rotation
curves and radial acceleration relations. This is achieved by post-processing state-of-the-art
simulations of disc galaxy formation from the Auriga Project, using the MG-Gadget modified gravity
code. We find that for a given galaxy, the surface dividing screened and unscreened regions adopts
an oblate shape, reflecting the disc morphology of the galaxy. At the 'screening radius'---the
radius at which screening is triggered in the disc plane---characteristic 'upturns' are present
in both rotation curves and radial acceleration relations. The location of these features depends
on various factors, such as the galaxy mass, the concentration of the density profile and the value
of the background field amplitude fR0. Self-screening of stars and environmental screening also
play a role. For Milky Way-size galaxies, we find that a model with $|\bar{f}_\mathrm{R0}|=10^{-7}$
results in rotation curves that are indistinguishable from $\Lambda$CDM, while for $|\bar{f}_\mathrm{R0}|
\geq 2 \times 10^{-6}$ the simulated galaxies are entirely unscreened, violating Solar System
constraints. For intermediate values, distinct upturns are present. With careful statistical
analyses of observed rotation curves, constraints on f(R) gravity with a sensitivity down to $|\bar{f}_\mathrm{R0}|\sim10^{-7}$
should be possible.
