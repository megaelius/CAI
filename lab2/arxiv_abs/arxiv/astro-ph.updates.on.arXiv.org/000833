By modelling the axis ratio distribution of SDSS DR8 galaxies we find the intrinsic 3D shapes of spirals
and ellipticals. We use morphological information from the Galaxy Zoo project and assume a non-parametric
distribution intrinsic of shapes, while taking into account dust extinction. We measure the dust
extinction of the full sample of spiral galaxies and find a smaller value than previous estimations,
with an edge-on extinction of $E_0 = 0.284^{+0.015}_{-0.026}$ in the SDSS r band. We also find that
the distribution of minor to major axis ratio has a mean value of $ 0.267 \pm 0.009 $, slightly larger
than previous estimates mainly due to the lower extinction used; the same affects the circularity
of galactic discs, which are found to be less round in shape than in previous studies, with a mean ellipticity
of $0.215 \pm 0.013$. For elliptical galaxies, we find that the minor to major axis ratio, with a mean
value of $0.584 \pm 0.006$, is larger than previous estimations due to the removal of spiral interlopers
present in samples with morphological information from photometric profiles. These interlopers
are removed when selecting ellipticals using Galaxy Zoo data. We find that the intrinsic shapes
of galaxies and their dust extinction vary with absolute magnitude, colour and physical size. We
find that bright elliptical galaxies are more spherical than faint ones, a trend that is also present
with galaxy size, and that there is no dependence of elliptical galaxy shape with colour. For spiral
galaxies we find that the reddest ones have higher dust extinction as expected, due to the fact that
this reddening is mainly due to dust. We also find that the thickness of discs increases with luminosity
and size, and that brighter, smaller and redder galaxies have less round discs.
