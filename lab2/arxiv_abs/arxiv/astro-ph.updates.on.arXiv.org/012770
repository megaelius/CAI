The process of massive star ($M\geq8~M_\odot$) formation is still poorly understood. Observations
of massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) are challenging due to their rarity, short formation timescale,
large distances, and high circumstellar extinction. Here, we present the results of a spectroscopic
analysis of a population of MYSOs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We took advantage of the spectral
resolution and wavelength coverage of X-shooter (300-2500 nm), mounted on the European Southern
Observatory Very Large Telescope, to detect characteristic spectral features in a dozen MYSO candidates
near 30 Doradus, the largest starburst region in the Local Group hosting the most massive stars known.
The X-shooter spectra are strongly contaminated by nebular emission. We used a scaling method to
subtract the nebular contamination from our objects. We detect H$\alpha,\beta$, [O I] 630.0 nm,
Ca II infrared triplet, [Fe II] 1643.5 nm, fluorescent Fe II 1687.8 nm, H$_2$ 2121.8 nm, Br$\gamma$,
and CO bandhead emission in the spectra of multiple candidates. This leads to the spectroscopic
confirmation of 10 candidates as bona fide MYSOs. We compare our observations with photometric
observations from the literature and find all MYSOs to have a strong near-infrared excess. We compute
lower limits to the brightness and luminosity of the MYSO candidates, confirming the near-infrared
excess and the massive nature of the objects. No clear correlation is seen between the Br$\gamma$
luminosity and metallicity. Combining our sample with other LMC samples results in a combined detection
rate of disk features such as fluorescent Fe II and CO bandheads which is consistent with the Galactic
rate (40\%). Most of our MYSOs show outflow features.
