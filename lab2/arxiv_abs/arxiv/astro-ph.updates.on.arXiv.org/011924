We report the serendipitous discovery of an object, UVQS J060819.93-715737.4, with a spectrum
dominated by extremely intense, narrow C II emission lines. The spectrum is similar to those of the
very rare, late-type [WC11] low-mass Wolf-Rayet stars. Despite the recognition of these stars
as a distinct class decades ago, there remains barely a handful of Galactic members, all of which
are also planetary-nebula central stars. Although no obvious surrounding nebulosity is present
in J0608, [O II], [N II], and [S II] emission suggest the presence of an inconspicuous, low-excitation
nebula. There is low-amplitude incoherent photometric variability on timescales of days to years,
as well as numerous prominent P Cygni profiles, implying mass loss. There are indications of a binary
companion. The star is located on the outskirts of the LMC, and the observed radial velocity (~250
km/s) and proper motion strongly suggest membership. If indeed an LMC member, this is the first extragalactic
late [WC] star, and the first with an accurately determined luminosity, as the Galactic examples
are too distant for precise parallax determinations. A high-quality, broad-coverage spectrum
of the prototype of the late [WC] class, CPD -56 8032, is also presented. We discuss different excitation
mechanisms capable of producing the great strength of the C II emission. Numerous autoionizing
levels of C II are definitely populated by processes other than dielectronic recombination. Despite
the spectacular emission spectra, observational selection makes objects such as these difficult
to discover. Members of the [WC11] class may in fact be considerably more common than the handful
of previously known late [WC] stars.
