Spontaneous breaking of Lorentz symmetry at energies on the order of the Planck energy or lower is
predicted by many quantum gravity theories, implying non-trivial dispersion relations for the
photon in vacuum. Consequently, gamma-rays of different energies, emitted simultaneously from
astrophysical sources, could accumulate measurable differences in their time of flight until
they reach the Earth. Such tests have been carried out in the past using fast variations of gamma-ray
flux from pulsars, and more recently from active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts. We present
new constraints studying the gamma-ray emission of the galactic Crab Pulsar, recently observed
up to TeV energies by the MAGIC collaboration. A profile likelihood analysis of pulsar events reconstructed
for energies above 400GeV finds no significant variation in arrival time as their energy increases.
Ninety-five percent~CL limits are obtained on the effective Lorentz invariance violating energy
scale at the level of $E_{\mathrm{QG}_1} > 5.5\cdot 10^{17}$GeV ($4.5\cdot 10^{17}$GeV) for a
linear, and $E_{\mathrm{QG}_2} > 5.9\cdot 10^{10}$GeV ($5.3\cdot 10^{10}$GeV) for a quadratic
scenario, for the subluminal and the superluminal cases, respectively. A substantial part of this
study is dedicated to calibration of the test statistic, with respect to bias and coverage properties.
Moreover, the limits take into account systematic uncertainties, found to worsen the statistical
limits by about 36--42\%. Our constraints would have resulted much more competitive if the intrinsic
pulse shape of the pulsar between 200GeV and 400GeV was understood in sufficient detail and allowed
inclusion of events well below 400GeV.
