The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is the most promising mechanism by which angular momentum
is efficiently transported outwards in astrophysical discs. However, its application to protoplanetary
discs remains problematic. These discs are so poorly ionised that they may not support magnetorotational
turbulence in regions referred to as `dead zones'. It has recently been suggested that the Hall effect,
a non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effect, could revive these dead zones by enhancing the magnetically
active column density by an order of magnitude or more. We investigate this idea by performing local,
three-dimensional, resistive Hall-MHD simulations of the MRI in situations where the Hall effect
dominates over Ohmic dissipation. As expected from linear stability analysis, we find an exponentially
growing instability in regimes otherwise linearly stable in resistive MHD. However, instead of
vigorous and sustained magnetorotational turbulence, we find that the MRI saturates by producing
large-scale, long-lived, axisymmetric structures in the magnetic and velocity fields. We refer
to these structures as zonal fields and zonal flows, respectively. Their emergence causes a steep
reduction in turbulent transport by at least two orders of magnitude from extrapolations based
upon resistive MHD, a result that calls into question contemporary models of layered accretion.
We construct a rigorous mean-field theory to explain this new behaviour and to predict when it should
occur. Implications for protoplanetary disc structure and evolution, as well as for theories of
planet formation, are briefly discussed.
