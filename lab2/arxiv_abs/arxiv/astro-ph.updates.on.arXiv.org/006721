Neutron-star (NS) - white-dwarf (WD) mergers may give rise to observable explosive transients,
but have been little explored. We use 2D coupled hydrodynamical-thermonuclear FLASH-code simulations
to study the evolution of WD debris-disks formed following WD-disruptions by NSs. We use a 19-elements
nuclear-network and a detailed equation-of-state to follow the evolution, complemented by a post-process
analysis using a larger 125-isotopes nuclear-network. We consider a wide range of initial conditions
and study the dependence of the results on the NS/WD masses ($1.4-2{\rm M_{\odot}}$;$\,{\rm 0.375-0.7\,M_{\odot}}$,
respectively), WD-composition (CO/He/hybrid-He-CO) and the accretion-disk structure. We find
that viscous inflow in the disk gives rise to continuous wind-outflow of mostly C/O material mixed
with nuclear-burning products arising from a weak detonation occurring in the inner region of the
disk. We find that such transients are energetically weak ($10^{48}-10^{49}$ergs) compared with
thermonuclear-supernovae (SNe), and are dominated by the (gravitational) accretion-energy.
Although thermonuclear-detonations occur robustly in all of our simulations (besides the He-WD)
they produce only little energy $(1-10\%$ of the kinetic energy) and $^{56}{\rm Ni}$ ejecta (few$\times10^{-4}-10^{-3}{\rm
M_{\odot}})$, with overall low ejecta masses of $\sim0.01-0.1{\rm M_{\odot}}$. Such explosions
may produce rapidly-evolving transients, much shorter and fainter than regular type-Ia SNe. The
composition and demographics of such SNe appear to be inconsistent with those of Ca-rich type Ib
SNe. Though they might be related to the various classes of rapidly evolving SNe observed in recent
years, they are likely to be fainter than the typical ones, and may therefore give rise a different
class of potentially observable transients.
