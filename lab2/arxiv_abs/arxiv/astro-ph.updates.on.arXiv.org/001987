Using G dwarfs from the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE) survey,
we have determined a vertical metallicity gradient over a large volume of the Milky Way's disk, and
examined how this gradient varies for different [a/Fe] subsamples. This sample contains over 40,000
stars with low-resolution spectroscopy over 144 lines of sight. We employ the SEGUE Stellar Parameter
Pipeline (SSPP) to obtain estimates of effective temperature, surface gravity, [Fe/H], and [a/Fe]
for each star and extract multiple volume-complete subsamples of approximately 1000 stars each.
Based on the survey's consistent target-selection algorithm, we adjust each subsample to determine
an unbiased picture of the disk in [Fe/H] and [a/Fe]; consequently, each individual star represents
the properties of many. The SEGUE sample allows us to constrain the vertical metallicity gradient
for a large number of stars over a significant volume of the disk, between ~0.3 and 1.6 kpc from the
Galactic plane, and examine the in situ structure, in contrast to previous analyses which are more
limited in scope. This work does not pre-suppose a disk structure, whether composed of a single complex
population or a distinct thin and thick disk component. The metallicity gradient is -0.243 +0.039
-0.053 dex/kpc for the sample as a whole, which we compare to various literature results. Each [a/Fe]
subsample dominates at a different range of heights above the plane of the Galaxy, which is exhibited
in the gradient found in the sample as a whole. Stars over a limited range in [a/Fe] show little change
in median [Fe/H] with height. If we associate [a/Fe] with age, our consistent vertical metallicity
gradients with [a/Fe] suggest that stars formed in different epochs exhibit comparable vertical
structure, implying similar star-formation processes and evolution.
