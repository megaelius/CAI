Understanding when, how and where star formation ceased (quenching) within galaxies is still a
critical subject in galaxy evolution studies. Taking advantage of the new methodology developed
by Quai et al. (2018) to select recently quenched galaxies, we explored the spatial information
provided by IFU data to get critical insights on this process. In particular, we analyse 10 SDSS-IV
MaNGA galaxies that show regions with low [O III]/H{\alpha} compatible with a recent quenching
of the star formation. We compare the properties of these 10 galaxies with those of a control sample
of 8 MaNGA galaxies with ongoing star formation in the same stellar mass, redshift and gas-phase
metallicity range. The quenching regions found are located between 0.5 and 1.1 effective radii
from the centre. This result is supported by the analysis of the average radial profile of the ionisation
parameter, which reaches a minimum at the same radii, while the one of the star-forming sample shows
an almost flat trend. These quenching regions occupy a total area between 15\% and 45\% of our galaxies.
Moreover, the average radial profile of the star formation rate surface density of our sample is
lower and flatter than that of the control sample, at any radii, suggesting a systematic suppression
of the star formation in the inner part of our galaxies. Finally, the radial profile of gas-phase
metallicity of the two samples have a similar slope and normalisation. Our results cannot be ascribed
to a difference in the intrinsic properties of the analysed galaxies, suggesting a quenching scenario
more complicated than a simple inside-out quenching.
