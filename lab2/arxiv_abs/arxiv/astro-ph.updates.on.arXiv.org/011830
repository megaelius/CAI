We present an in-depth and systematic analysis of a sample of 20 powerful blazars, including 12 BL
Lacs and 8 flat spectrum radio quasars, utilizing Fermi/LAT observations from the period 2008--2018
using various analysis tools such as flux distribution, symmetry analysis, and time series analysis.
Results show that blazars with steeper $\gamma$-ray spectral indexes are found to be more variable;
and the $\gamma$-ray flux distribution closely resemble both normal and lognormal probability
distribution functions. The statistical variability properties of the sources as studied by power
spectral density analysis are consistent with flicker noise ($P(\nu)\propto1/\nu$) -- an indication
of long-memory processes at work. Statistical analysis of the distribution of flux rise and decay
rates in the light curves of the sources, aimed at distinguishing between particle acceleration
and energy dissipation timescales, counter-intuitively suggests that both kinds of rates follow
a similar distribution and the derived mean variability timescales are in the order of a few weeks.
The corresponding emission region size is used to constrain location of $\gamma$-ray production
sites in the sources to be a few parsecs. Additionally, using Lomb-Scargle periodogram aided with
extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we detected year timescale quasi-periodic oscillations in
the sources S5 0716+714, Mrk 421, ON +325, PKS 1424-418 and PKS 2155-304; and the detection significance
was computed taking proper account of the red-noise and other artifacts inherent in the observations.
We explain our results in the light of current blazar models with relativistic shocks propagating
down the jet viewed close to the line of sight.
