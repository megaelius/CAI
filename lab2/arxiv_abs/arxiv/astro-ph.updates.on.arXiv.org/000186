Measurements of [C/Fe], [Ca/H], and [Fe/H] have been derived from Keck I LRISb spectra of 35 giants
in the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The iron abundances are derived by a spectrum synthesis modeling
of the wavelength region from 4850 to 5375 A, while calcium and carbon abundances are obtained by
fitting the Ca II H and K lines and the CH G band respectively. A range in metallicity of -2.9 <= [Fe/H]}
<= -1.6 is found within the giants sampled, with a good correlation between [Fe/H] and [Ca/H].
The great majority of stars in the sample would be classified as having weak absorption in the lambda
3883 CN band, with only a small scatter in band strengths at a given luminosity on the red giant branch.
In this sense the behavior of CN among the Draco giants is consistent with the predominantly weak
CN bands found among red giants in globular clusters of metallicity [Fe/H] < -1.8. Over half of
the giants in the Draco sample have [Fe/H] > -2.25, and among these there is a trend for the [C/Fe]
abundance to decrease with increasing luminosity on the red giant branch. This is a phenomenon that
is also seen among both field and globular cluster giants of the Galactic halo, where it has been interpreted
as a consequence of deep mixing of material between the base of the convective envelope and the outer
limits of the hydrogen-burning shell. However, among the six Draco giants observed that turn out
to have metallicities -2.65 < [Fe/H] < -2.25 there is no such trend seen in the carbon abundance.
This may be due to small sample statistics or primordial inhomogeneities in carbon abundance among
the most metal-poor Draco stars. We identify a potential carbon-rich extremely metal-poor star
in our sample. This candidate will require follow up observations for confirmation.
