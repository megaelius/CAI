Cosmic rays are transported out of the galaxy by diffusion and advection due to streaming along magnetic
field lines and resonant scattering off self-excited MHD waves. Thus momentum is transferred to
the plasma via the frozen-in waves as a mediator assisting the thermal pressure in driving a galactic
wind. The bulk of the Galactic CRs are accelerated by shock waves generated in SNRs, a significant
fraction of which occur in OB associations on a timescale of several $10^7$ years. We examine the
effect of changing boundary conditions at the base of the galactic wind due to sequential SN explosions
on the outflow. Thus pressure waves will steepen into shock waves leading to in situ post-acceleration
of GCRs. We performed simulations of galactic winds in flux tube geometry appropriate for disk galaxies,
describing the CR diffusive-advective transport in a hydrodynamical fashion along with the energy
exchange with self-generated MHD waves. Our time-dependent CR hydrodynamic simulations confirm
the existence of time asymptotic outflow solutions (for constant boundary conditions). It is also
found that high-energy particles escaping from the Galaxy and having a power-law distribution
in energy ($\propto E^{-2.7}$) similar to the Milky Way with an upper energy cut-off at $\sim 10^{15}$
eV are subjected to efficient and rapid post-SNR acceleration in the lower galactic halo up to energies
of $10^{17} - 10^{18}$ eV by multiple shock waves propagating through the halo. The particles can
gain energy within less than $3\,$kpc from the galactic plane corresponding to flow times less than
$5\cdot 10^6\,$years. The mechanism described here offers a natural solution to explain the power-law
distribution of CRs between the "knee" and the "ankle". The mechanism described here offers a natural
and elegant solution to explain the power-law distribution of CRs between the "knee" and the "ankle".
