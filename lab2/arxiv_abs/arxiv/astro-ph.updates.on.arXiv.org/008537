Faraday tomography allows us to map diffuse polarized synchrotron emission from our Galaxy and
use it to interpret the magnetic field in the interstellar medium (ISM). We have applied Faraday
tomography to 60 observations from the LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey (LOTSS) and produced a Faraday
depth cube mosaic covering 568 square degrees at high Galactic latitudes, at 4.3' angular resolution
and 1 rad m$^{-2}$ Faraday depth resolution, with a typical noise level of 50--100 $\mu$Jy per point
spread function (PSF) per rotation measure spread function (RMSF) (40-80 mK RMSF$^{-1}$). While
parts of the images are strongly affected by instrumental polarization, we observe diffuse polarized
emission throughout most of the field, with typical brightness between 1 and 6 K RMSF$^{-1}$, and
Faraday depths between $-7$ and +25 rad m$^{-2}$. We observed many new polarization features, some
up to 15 degrees in length. These include two regions with very uniformly structured, linear gradients
in the Faraday depth; we measured the steepness of these gradients as 2.6 and 13 rad m$^{-2}$ deg$^{-1}$.
We also observed a relationship between one of the gradients and an HI filament in the local ISM. Other
ISM tracers were also checked for correlations with our polarization data and none were found, but
very little signal was seen in most tracers in this region. We conclude that the LOTSS data are very
well suited for Faraday tomography, and that a full-scale survey with all the LOTSS data has the potential
to reveal many new Galactic polarization features and map out diffuse Faraday depth structure across
the entire northern hemisphere.
