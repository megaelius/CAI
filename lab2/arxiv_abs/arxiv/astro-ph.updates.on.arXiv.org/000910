Stars interact with their close-in planets through radiation, gravitation, and magnetic fields.
We investigate the energy input to a planetary atmosphere by reconnection between stellar and planetary
magnetic fields and compare it to the energy input of the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation field
of the star. We quantify the power released by magnetic reconnection at the boundary of the planetary
magnetosphere that is conveyed to the atmosphere by accelerated electrons. We introduce simple
models to evaluate the energy spectrum of the accelerated electrons and the energy dissipated in
the atmospheric layers in the polar regions of the planet upon which they impinge. A simple transonic
isothermal wind flow along field lines is considered to estimate the increase in mass loss rate in
comparison with a planet irradiated only by the EUV flux of its host star. We find that energetic electrons
can reach levels down to column densities of 10^{23}-10^{25} m^{-2}, comparable with or deeper
than EUV photons, and increase the mass loss rate up to a factor of 30-50 in close-in (< 0.10 AU),
massive (> 1.5 Jupiter masses) planets. Mass loss rates up to (0.5-1.0)x10^{9} kg/s are found
for atmospheres heated by electrons accelerated by magnetic reconnection at the boundary of planetary
magnetospheres. On the other hand, average mass loss rates up to (0.3-1.0)x10^{10} kg/s are found
in the case of magnetic loops interconnecting the planet with the star. The star-planet magnetic
interaction provides a remarkable source of energy for planetary atmospheres, generally comparable
with or exceeding that of stellar EUV radiation for close-in planets. Therefore, it must be included
in models of chemical evolution or evaporation of planetary atmospheres as well as in modelling
of light curves of transiting planets at UV wavelengths.
