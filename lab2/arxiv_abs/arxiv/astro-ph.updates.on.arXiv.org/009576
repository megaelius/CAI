There is a great need in several areas of astrophysics and space-physics to carry out high order of
accuracy, divergence-free MHD simulations on spherical meshes. This requires us to pay careful
attention to the interplay between mesh quality and numerical algorithms. Methods have been designed
that fundamentally integrate high order isoparametric mappings with the other high accuracy algorithms
that are needed for divergence-free MHD simulations on geodesic meshes. The goal of this paper is
to document such algorithms that are implemented in the geodesic mesh version of the RIEMANN code.
The fluid variables are reconstructed using a special kind of WENO-AO algorithm that integrates
the mesh geometry into the reconstruction process from the ground-up. A novel divergence-free
reconstruction strategy for the magnetic field that performs efficiently at all orders, even on
isoparametrically mapped meshes, is then presented. The MHD equations are evolved in space and
time using a novel ADER predictor algorithm that is efficiently adapted to the isoparametrically
mapped geometry. The application of one-dimensional and multidimensional Riemann solvers at
suitable locations on the mesh then provides the corrector step. The corrector step for the magnetic
field uses a Yee-type staggering of magnetic fields. This results in a scheme with divergence-free
update for the magnetic field. The use of ADER enables a one-step update which only requires one messaging
operation per complete timestep. This is very beneficial for parallel processing. Several accuracy
tests are presented as are stringent test problems. PetaScale performance is also demonstrated
on the largest available supercomputers.
