Our aim is to investigate the nature and formation of brown dwarfs by adding a new well-characterised
object to the small sample of less than 20 transiting brown dwarfs. One brown dwarf candidate was
found by the KESPRINT consortium when searching for exoplanets in the K2 space mission Campaign
16 field. We combined the K2 photometric data with a series of multi-colour photometric observations,
imaging and radial velocity measurements to rule out false positive scenarios and to determine
the fundamental properties of the system. We report the discovery and characterisation of a transiting
brown dwarf in a 5.17 day eccentric orbit around the slightly evolved F7V star EPIC 212036875. We
find a stellar mass of 1.15+/-0.08 M$_\odot$, a stellar radius of 1.41+/-0.05 R$_\odot$, and an
age of 5.1+/-0.9 Gyr. The mass and radius of the companion brown dwarf are 51+/-2 MJ and 0.83+/-0.03
RJ, respectively, corresponding to a mean density of 108+15-13 g cm-3. EPIC 212036875 b is a rare
object that resides in the brown dwarf desert. In the mass-density diagram for planets, brown dwarfs
and stars, we find that all giant planets and brown dwarfs follow the same trend from ~0.3 MJ to the
turn-over to hydrogen burning stars at ~73 MJ. EPIC 212036875 b falls close to the theoretical model
for mature H/He dominated objects in this diagram as determined by interior structure models, as
well as the empirical fit. We argue that EPIC 212036875 b formed via gravitational disc instabilities
in the outer part of the disc, followed by a quick migration. Orbital tidal circularisation may have
started early in its history for a brief period when the brown dwarf's radius was larger. The lack
of spin-orbit synchronisation points to a weak stellar dissipation parameter which implies a circularisation
timescale of >23 Gyr, or suggests an interaction between the magnetic and tidal forces of the star
and the brown dwarf.
