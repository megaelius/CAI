{CircumStellar Envelopes (CSEs) of stars are complex chemical objects for which theoretical models
encounter difficulties in elaborating a comprehensive overview of the occurring chemical processes.
Along with photodissociation, ion-neutral reactions and dissociative recombination might play
an important role in controlling molecular growth in outer CSEs. The aim of this work is to provide
experimental insights into pathways of photochemistry-driven molecular growth within outer
CSEs to draw a more complete picture of the chemical processes occurring within these molecule-rich
environments. A simplified CSE environment was therefore reproduced in the laboratory through
gas-phase experiments exposing relevant gas mixtures to an Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) photon source.
This photochemical reactor should ultimately allow us to investigate chemical processes and their
resulting products occurring under conditions akin to outer CSEs. We used a recently developed
EUV lamp coupled to the APSIS photochemical cell to irradiate CSE relevant gas mixtures of H$_2$,
CO and N$_2$, at one wavelength, 73.6 nm. The detection and identification of chemical species in
the photochemical reactor was achieved through in-situ mass spectrometry analysis of neutral
and cationic molecules. We find that exposing CO-N$_2$-H$_2$ gas mixtures to EUV photons at 73.6
nm induces photochemical reactions that yield the formation of complex, neutral and ionic species.
Our work shows that N$_2$H$^+$ can be formed through photochemistry along with highly oxygenated
ion molecules like HCO$^+$ in CSE environments. We also observe neutral N-rich organic species
including triazole and aromatic molecules. These results confirm the suitability of our experimental
setting to investigate photochemical reactions and provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms
of molecular growth in the outer CSEs.
