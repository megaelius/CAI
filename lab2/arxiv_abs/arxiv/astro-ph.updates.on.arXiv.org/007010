Gamma-ray emitting narrow-line Seyfert 1 ($\gamma$-NLSy1) galaxies are thought to harbour relatively
low-mass black holes (10$^6$-10$^8$ M$_{\odot}$) accreting close to the Eddington limit. They
show characteristics similar to those of blazars, such as flux and spectral variability in the gamma-ray
energy band and radio properties which point toward the presence of a relativistic jet. These characteristics
make them an intriguing class of sources to be investigated with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA),
the next-generation ground-based gamma-ray observatory. We present our extensive set of simulations
of all currently known $\gamma$-ray emitters identified as NLS1s (20 sources),investigating
their detections and spectral properties, taking into account the effect of both the extra-galactic
background light in the propagation of gamma-rays and intrinsic absorption components.We find
that the prospects for observations of $\gamma$-NLSy1 with CTA are promising. In particular, the
brightest sources of our sample, SBS 0846+513, PMN J0948+0022, and PKS 1502+036 can be detected
during high/flaring states, the former two even in the case in which the emission occurs within the
highly opaque central regions, which prevent $\gamma$ rays above few tens of GeV to escape. In this
case the low-energy threshold of CTA will play a key role. If, on the other hand, high-energy emission
occurs outside the broad line region, we can detect the sources up to several hundreds of GeV-depending
on the intrinsic shape of the emitted spectrum. Therefore, CTA observations will provide valuable
information on the physical conditions and emission properties of their jets.
