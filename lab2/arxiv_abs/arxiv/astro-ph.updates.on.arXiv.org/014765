Spectroscopic phase curves provide unique access to the three-dimensional properties of transiting
exoplanet atmospheres. However, a modeling framework must be developed to deliver accurate inferences
of atmospheric properties for these complex data sets. Here, we develop an approach to retrieve
temperature structures and molecular abundances from phase curve spectra at any orbital phase.
In the context of a representative hot Jupiter with a large day-night temperature contrast, we examine
the biases in typical one-dimensional (1D) retrievals as a function of orbital phase/geometry,
compared to two-dimensional (2D) models that appropriately capture the disk-integrated phase
geometry. We guide our intuition by applying our new framework on a simulated HST+Spitzer phase
curve data set in which the "truth" is known, followed by an application to the spectroscopic phase
curve of the canonical hot Jupiter, WASP-43b. We also demonstrate the retrieval framework on simulated
JWST phase curve observations. We apply our new geometric framework to a joint-fit of all spectroscopic
phases, assuming longitudinal molecular abundance homogeneity, resulting in an a factor of 2 improvement
in abundances precision when compared to individual phase constraints. With a 1D retrieval model
on simulated HST+Spitzer data, we find strongly biased molecular abundances for CH$_4$ and CO$_2$
at most orbital phases. With 2D, the day and night profiles retrieved from WASP-43b remain consistent
throughout the orbit. JWST retrievals show that a 2D model is strongly favored at all orbital phases.
Based on our new 2D retrieval implementation, we provide recommendations on when 1D models are appropriate
and when more complex phase geometries involving multiple TP profiles are required to obtain an
unbiased view of tidally locked planetary atmospheres.
