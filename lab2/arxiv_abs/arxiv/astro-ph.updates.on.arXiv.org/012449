Tidal disruption events (TDEs), events in which a star passes very close to a supermassive black
hole, are generally imagined as leading either to the star's complete disruption or to its passage
directly into the black hole. In the former case it is widely believed that in all cases the bound portion
of the debris quickly "circularizes" due to relativistic apsidal precession, i.e., forms a compact
accretion disk, and emits a flare of standardized lightcurve and spectrum. We show here that TDEs
are more diverse and can be grouped into several distinct categories on the basis of stellar pericenter
distance $r_p$; we calculate the relative frequency of these categories. In particular, because
rapid circularization requires $r_p \lesssim 10r_g$ ($r_g \equiv GM_{\rm BH}/c^2$), it can happen
in only a minority of total disruptions, $\lesssim 1/4$ when the black hole has mass $M_{\rm BH} =
10^6 M_\odot$. For larger pericenter distances, $10 < r_p/r_g < 27$ (for $M_{\rm BH}=10^6M_\odot$),
main sequence stars are completely disrupted, but the bound debris orbits are highly eccentric
and possess semimajor axes $\sim 100\times$ the scale of the expected compact disk. Partial disruptions
with fractional mass-loss $\gtrsim 10\%$ should occur with a rate similar to that of total disruptions;
for fractional mass-loss $\gtrsim 50\%$, the rate is $\approx 1/3$ as large. Partial disruptions---which
must precede total disruptions when the stars' angular momenta evolve in the "empty loss-cone"
regime---change the orbital energy by factors $\gtrsim O(1)$. Remnants of partial disruptions
are in general far from thermal equilibrium. Depending on the orbital energy of the remnant and conditions
within the stellar cluster surrounding the SMBH, it may return after hundreds or thousands of years
and be fully disrupted, or it may rejoin the stellar cluster.
