We study low-density axisymmetric accretion flows onto black holes (BHs) with two-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations, adopting the $\alpha$-viscosity prescription. When the gas angular
momentum is low enough to form a rotationally supported disk within the Bondi radius ($R_{\rm B}$),
we find a global steady accretion solution. The solution consists of a rotational equilibrium distribution
at $r\sim R_{\rm B}$, where the density follows $\rho \propto (1+R_{\rm B}/r)^{3/2}$, surrounding
a geometrically thick and optically thin accretion disk at the centrifugal radius, where thermal
energy generated by viscosity is transported via strong convection. Physical properties of the
inner solution agree with those expected in convection-dominated accretion flows (CDAF; $\rho
\propto r^{-1/2}$). In the inner CDAF solution, the gas inflow rate decreases towards the center
due to convection ($\dot{M}\propto r$), and the net accretion rate (including both inflows and
outflows) is strongly suppressed by several orders of magnitude from the Bondi accretion rate $\dot{M}_{\rm
B}$ The net accretion rate depends on the viscous strength, following $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm B}\propto
(\alpha/0.01)^{0.6}$. This solution holds for low accretion rates of $\dot{M}_{\rm B}/\dot{M}_{\rm
Edd}< 10^{-3}$ having minimal radiation cooling, where $\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington rate.
In a hot plasma at the bottom ($r<10^{-3}~R_{\rm B}$), thermal conduction would dominate the convective
energy flux. Since suppression of the accretion by convection ceases, the final BH feeding rate
is found to be $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm B} \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$. This rate is as low as $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm
Edd} \sim 10^{-7}-10^{-6}$ inferred for SgrA$^*$ and the nuclear BHs in M31 and M87, and can explain
the low luminosities in these sources, without invoking any feedback mechanism.
