(Abridged) The effective extinction law (attenuation behavior) in galaxies in the emitted ultraviolet
is well known only for actively star-forming objects and combines effects of the grain properties,
fine structure in the dust distribution, and relative distributions of stars and dust. We use GALEX,
XMM Optical Monitor, and HST data to explore the UV attenuation in the outer parts of spiral disks
which are backlit by other UV-bright galaxies, starting with candidates provided by Galaxy Zoo
participants. Our analysis incorporates galaxy symmetry, using non-overlapping regions of each
galaxy to derive error estimates on the attenuation measurements. The entire sample has an attenuation
law close to the Calzetti et al. (1994) form; the UV slope for the overall sample is substantially
shallower than found by Wild et al. (2011), a reasonable match to the more distant galaxies in our
sample but not to the weighted combination including NGC 2207. The nearby, bright spiral NGC 2207
alone gives accuracy almost equal to the rest of our sample, and its outer arms have a very low level
of foreground starlight. This "grey" law can be produced from the distribution of dust alone, without
a necessary contribution from differential escape of stars from dense clouds. The extrapolation
needed to compare attenution between backlit galaxies at moderate redshifts, and local systems
from SDSS data, is mild enough to allow use of galaxy overlaps to trace the cosmic history of dust.
For NGC 2207, the covering factor of clouds with small optical attenuation becomes a dominant factor
farther into the ultraviolet, which opens the possibility that widespread diffuse dust dominates
over dust in star-forming regions deep into the ultraviolet. Comparison with published radiative-transfer
models indicates that the role of dust clumping dominates over differences in grain populations,
at this spatial resolution.
