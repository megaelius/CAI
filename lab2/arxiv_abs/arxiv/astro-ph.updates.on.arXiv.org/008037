Context. Increasing our knowledge of the interior structure, composition and density distribution
of exoplanets is crucial to make progress in the understanding of exoplanetary formation, migration
and habitability. However, the directly measurable mass and radius values offer little constraint
on interior structure, because the inverse problem is highly degenerate. Therefore there is a clear
need for a third observable of exoplanet interiors. This third observable can be the $k_2$ fluid
Love number which measures the central mass concentration of an exoplanet. Aims. The aims of this
paper are (i) to develop a basic model to fit the long-term radial velocity and TTV variations caused
by tidal interactions, (ii) to apply the model to the WASP-18Ab system, and (iii) to estimate the
Love number of the planet. Methods. Archival radial velocity, transit and occultation timing data
are collected and fitted via the model introduced here. Results. The best model fit to the archival
radial velocity and timing data of WASP-18Ab was obtained with a Love number of the massive ($\sim
10 M_\mathrm{Jup}$) hot Jupiter WASP-18Ab: $k_{2,Love} = 0.62^{+0.55}_{-0.19}$. This causes
apsidal motion in the system, at a rate of $\sim0.0087\pm0.0033^\circ / \mathrm{days} \approxeq
31.3\pm11.8$ arcseconds/day. When checking possible causes of periastron precession, other
than the relativistic term or the non-spherical shape of the components, we found a companion star
to the WASP-18 system, named WASP-18B which is a probable M6.5V dwarf with $\sim 0.1~M_\odot$ at
3519 AU distance from the transit host star. We also find that small orbital eccentricities may be
real, rather than an apparent effect caused by the non spherical stellar shape.
