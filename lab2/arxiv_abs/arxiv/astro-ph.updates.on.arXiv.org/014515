We present details of the Automated Radio Telescope Imaging Pipeline (ARTIP) and results of a sensitive
blind search for HI and OH absorbers at $z<0.4$ and $z<0.7$, respectively. ARTIP is written in Python
3.6, extensively uses the Common Astronomy Software Application (CASA) tools and tasks, and is
designed to enable the geographically-distributed MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS) team
to collaboratively process large volumes of radio interferometric data. We apply it to the first
MALS dataset obtained using the 64-dish MeerKAT radio telescope and 32K channel mode of the correlator.
With merely 40 minutes on target, we present the most sensitive spectrum of PKS1830-211 ever obtained
and characterize the known HI ($z=0.19$) and OH ($z=0.89$) absorbers. We further demonstrate ARTIP's
capabilities to handle realistic observing scenarios by applying it to a sample of 72 bright radio
sources observed with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) to blindly search for
HI and OH absorbers. We estimate the numbers of HI and OH absorbers per unit redshift to be $n_{21}(z\sim0.18)<$0.14
and $n_{\rm OH}(z\sim0.40)<$0.12, respectively, and constrain the cold gas covering factor of
galaxies at large impact parameters (50 kpc $<\rho<$ 150 kpc) to be less than 0.022. Due to the small
redshift path, $\Delta z\sim$13 for HI with column density$>5.4\times10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$, the
survey has probed only the outskirts of star-forming galaxies at $\rho>30$ kpc. MALS with the expected
$\Delta z\sim10^{3-4}$ will overcome this limitation and provide stringent constraints on the
cold gas fraction of galaxies in diverse environments over $0<z<1.5$.
