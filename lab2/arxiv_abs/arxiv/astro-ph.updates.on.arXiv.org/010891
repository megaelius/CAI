Extended filamentary H$\alpha$ emission nebulae are a striking feature of nearby galaxy clusters
but the formation mechanism of the filaments, and the processes which shape their morphology remain
unclear. We conduct an investigation into the formation, evolution and destruction of dense gas
in the center of a simulated, Perseus-like, cluster under the influence of a spin-driven jet. We
particularly study the role played by condensation of dense gas from the diffuse intracluster medium,
and the impact of direct uplifting of existing dense gas by the jets, in determining the spatial distribution
and kinematics of the dense gas. We present a hydrodynamical simulation of an idealised Perseus-like
cluster using the adaptive mesh refinement code {\sc ramses}. Our simulation includes a supermassive
black hole (SMBH) that self-consistently tracks its spin evolution via its local accretion, and
in turn drives a large-scale jet whose direction is based on the black hole's spin evolution. We show
that the formation and destruction of dense gas is closely linked to the SMBH's feedback cycle, and
that its morphology is highly variable throughout the simulation. While extended filamentary
structures readily condense from the hot intra-cluster medium, they are easily shattered into
an overly clumpy distribution of gas during their interaction with the jet driven outflows. Condensation
occurs predominantly onto infalling gas located 5 - 15 kpc from the center during quiescent phases
of the central AGN, when the local ratio of the cooling time to free fall time falls below 20, i.e. when
$t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff} < 20$. We find evidence for both condensation and uplifting of dense gas,
but caution that purely hydrodynamical simulations struggle to effectively regulate the cluster
cooling cycle and produce overly clumpy distributions of dense gas morphologies, compared to observation.
