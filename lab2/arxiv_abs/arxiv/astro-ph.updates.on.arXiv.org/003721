Models and observations suggest that ice-particle aggregation at and beyond the snowline dominates
the earliest stages of planet-formation, which therefore is subject to many laboratory studies.
However, the pressure-temperature gradients in proto-planetary disks mean that the ices are constantly
processed, undergoing phase changes between different solid phases and the gas phase. Open questions
remain as to whether the properties of the icy particles themselves dictate collision outcomes
and therefore how effectively collision experiments reproduce conditions in pro- toplanetary
environments. Previous experiments often yielded apparently contradictory results on collision
outcomes, only agreeing in a temperature dependence setting in above $\approx$ 210 K. By exploiting
the unique capabilities of the NIMROD neutron scattering instrument, we characterized the bulk
and surface structure of icy particles used in collision experiments, and studied how these structures
alter as a function of temperature at a constant pressure of around 30 mbar. Our icy grains, formed
under liquid nitrogen, undergo changes in the crystalline ice-phase, sublimation, sintering
and surface pre-melting as they are heated from 103 to 247 K. An increase in the thickness of the diffuse
surface layer from $\approx$ 10 to $\approx$ 30 {\AA} ($\approx$ 2.5 to 12 bilayers) proves increased
molecular mobility at temperatures above $\approx$ 210 K. As none of the other changes tie-in with
the temperature trends in collisional outcomes, we conclude that the surface pre-melting phenomenon
plays a key role in collision experiments at these temperatures. Consequently, the pressure-temperature
environment, may have a larger influence on collision outcomes than previously thought.
