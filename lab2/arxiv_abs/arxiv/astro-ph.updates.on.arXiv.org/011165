Star-to-star dispersion of r-process elements has been observed in a significant number of old,
metal-poor globular clusters. We investigate early-time neutron-star mergers as the mechanism
for this enrichment. Through both numerical modeling and analytical arguments, we show that neutron-star
mergers cannot be induced through dynamical interactions early in the history of the cluster, even
when the most liberal assumptions about neutron-star segregation are assumed. Therefore, if neutron-star
mergers are the primary mechanism for r-process dispersion in globular clusters, they likely result
from the evolution of isolated, primordial binaries in the clusters. Through population modeling,
we find that moderate fractions of GCs with enrichment are only possible when a significant number
of double neutron-star progenitors proceed through Case BB mass transfer --- under various assumptions
for the initial properties of globular clusters, a neutron-star merger with the potential for enrichment
will occur in ~15-60% (~30-90%) of globular clusters if this mass transfer proceeds stably (unstably).
The strong anti-correlation between the pre-supernova orbital separation and post-supernova
systemic velocity due to mass loss in the supernova leads to efficient ejection of most enrichment
candidates from their host clusters. Thus, most enrichment events occur shortly after the double
neutron stars are born. This requires star-forming gas that can absorb the r-process ejecta to be
present in the globular cluster 30-50 Myr after the initial burst of star formation. If scenarios
for redistributing gas in globular clusters cannot act on these timescales, the number of neutron-star
merger enrichment candidates drops severely, and it is likely that another mechanism, such as r-process
enrichment from collapsars, is at play.
