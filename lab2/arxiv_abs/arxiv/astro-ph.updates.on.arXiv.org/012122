We present the results of flux density, spectral index, and polarization intra-night monitoring
studies of a sample of eight optically bright blazars, carried out by employing several small to
moderate aperture (0.4\,m to 1.5\,m diameter) telescopes fitted with CCDs and polarimeters located
in Europe, India, and Japan. The duty cycle of flux variability for the targets is found to be $\sim
45$ percent, similar to that reported in earlier studies. The computed two-point spectral indices
are found to be between 0.65 to 1.87 for our sample, comprised of low- and intermediate frequency
peaked blazars, with one exception; they are also found to be statistically variable for about half
the instances where `confirmed' variability is detected in flux density. In the analysis of the
spectral evolution of the targets on hourly timescale, a counter-clockwise loop (soft-lagging)
is noted in the flux-spectral index plane on two occasions, and in one case a clear spectral flattening
with the decreasing flux is observed. In our data set, we also observe a variety of flux-polarization
degree variability patterns, including instances with a relatively straightforward anti-correlation,
correlation, or counter-clockwise looping. These changes are typically reflected in the flux-polarization
angle plane: the anti-correlation between the flux and polarization degree is accompanied by an
anti-correlation between the polarization angle and flux, while the counter-clockwise flux-PD
looping behaviour is accompanied by a clockwise looping in the flux-polarization angle representation.
We discuss our findings in the framework of the internal shock scenario for blazar sources.
