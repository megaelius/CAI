Star-forming galaxies (SFGs) display a continuous distribution of specific star formation rates
(sSFR) which can be approximated by the superposition of two log-normal distributions. The 1st
of these encompasses the main sequence (MS) of SFGs, the 2nd one a rarer population of starbursts
(SB). We show that the sSFR-distribution of SBs can be regarded as the result of a physical process
(plausibly merging) taking the mathematical form of a log-normal boosting kernel and enhancing
star formation activity. We explore the utility of splitting the star-forming population into
MS and SB galaxies - an approach we term "2-Star Formation Mode" (2-SFM) framework - for understanding
their molecular gas properties. Variations of star formation efficiency (SFE) and gas fractions
among SFGs take a simple, redshift-independent form, once these quantities are normalized to the
value of an average MS galaxy. The change in SFE for galaxies undergoing a starburst event scales
supra-linearly with the SFR-increase, as expected for mergers. This implies a continuous distribution
of galaxies in the Schmidt-Kennicutt plane that separates more clearly into loci for SBs and normal
galaxies than observed in SFR vs. M* space. SBs with the largest deviations (>10-fold) from the
MS, like many local ULIRGs, are not average SBs, but even rarer events with progenitors having larger
gas fractions than typical MS galaxies. We statistically infer that the gas fractions of typical
SBs decrease by a factor of 2 to 3 with respect to their direct MS progenitors, as expected to occur
in short-term SFR-boosts during which internal gas reservoirs are drained more quickly than gas
is accreted from the cosmic web. We predict variations of the CO-to-H2 conversion factor in the SFR-M*
plane and provide evidence that the higher sSFR of distant galaxies is a direct consequence of larger
gas fraction in these systems.
