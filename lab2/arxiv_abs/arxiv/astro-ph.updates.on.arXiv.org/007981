The Sun provides the energy required to sustain life on Earth and drive our planet's atmospheric
circulation. However, establishing a solid physical connection between solar and tropospheric
variability has posed a considerable challenge across the spectrum of Earth-system science. The
canon of solar variability, the solar fiducial clock, lies almost exclusively with the 400 years
of human telescopic observations that demonstrates the waxing and waning number of sunspots, over
an 11(ish) year period. Recent research has demonstrated the critical importance of the underlying
22-year magnetic polarity cycle in establishing the shorter sunspot cycle. Integral to the manifestation
of the latter is the spatio-temporal overlapping and migration of oppositely polarized magnetic
bands. The points when these bands emerge at high solar latitudes and cancel at the equator are separated
by almost 20 years. Here we demonstrate the impact of these `termination' points on the Sun's radiative
output and particulate shielding of our atmosphere through the dramatically rapid reconfiguration
of solar magnetism. These events reset the Sun's fiducial clock and present a new portal to explore
the Sun-Earth connection. Using direct observation and proxies of solar activity going back six
decades we can, with high statistical significance, demonstrate an apparent correlation between
the solar cycle terminations and the largest swings of Earths oceanic indices--a previously overlooked
correspondence. Forecasting the Sun's global behavior places the next solar termination in early
2020 and we thus anticipate a strong El Ni\~no in 2019, and a strong La Ni\~na in 2020; should such a
major oceanic swing follow, our challenge becomes: when does correlation become causation and
how does the process work?
