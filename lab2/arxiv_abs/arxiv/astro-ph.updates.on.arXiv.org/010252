The object ESO456-SC38 (Djorgovski 2) is one of the globular clusters that is closest to the Galactic
center. It is on the blue horizontal branch and has a moderate metallicity of [Fe/H]~-1.0. It is thus
similar to the very old inner bulge globular clusters NGC 6522, NGC 6558, and HP 1, and therefore appears
to be part of the primeval formation stages of the Milky Way. The aim of this work is to determine an
accurate distance and metallicity for ESO456-SC38, as well as orbital parameters, in order to check
similarities with other clusters in the inner bulge that have previously been well studied in terms
of spectroscopy and photometry. This is a considerably fainter cluster that is contaminated by
a rich stellar field; it is also quite absorbed by the dusty foreground. We analyzed ESO456-SC38
based on Hubble Space Telescope photometry, with the filters F606W from ACS, F110W and F160W from
WFC3,and photometry in V and I from FORS2 at the VLT. We combined this with identified stars that are
covered by Gaia Data Release 2. The isochrone fitting was carried out with the statistical Markov
chain Monte Carlo method. We derive an accurate distance of dSun = 8.75+-0.12 kpc and a reddening
of E(B-V)=0.81^+0.02_-0.02. The best-fitting BaSTI isochrones correspond to an age of 12.70^{+0.72}_{-0.69}
Gyr and a metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.11^{+0.03}_{-0.03}. ESO 456-SC38 adds to the list of moderately
metal-poor globular clusters located in the inner bulge. It is on the blue horizontal branch and
is very old. The cluster is confined to the bulge and bar region, but it does not support the Galactic
bar structure. The old stellar population represented by clusters like this has to be taken into
account in models of Galactic bulge formation. Studying them also provides indications on the formation
times of the globular clusters themselves.
