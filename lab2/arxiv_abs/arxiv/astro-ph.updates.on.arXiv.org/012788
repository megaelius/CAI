We present the discovery of three sub-Neptune-sized planets transiting the nearby and bright Sun-like
star HD 191939 (TIC 269701147, TOI 1339), a $K_{s}=7.18$ magnitude G8V dwarf at a distance of only
54 parsecs. This multi-planetary system is one of the best candidates for atmospheric characterization
to date, with all its known planets suitable for multi-wavelength transmission spectroscopy.
We validate the planetary nature of the transit signals by combining five months of data from the
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite with follow-up ground-based photometry, archival optical
images, radial velocities, and high angular resolution observations. The three sub-Neptunes
have similar radii ($R_{b} = 3.37^{+0.13}_{-0.13}\,R_{\oplus}$, $R_{c}=3.22_{-0.14}^{+0.15}\,R_{\oplus}$,
and $R_{d}=3.16_{-0.11}^{+0.11}\,R_{\oplus}$) and their orbits are consistent with a stable,
circular, and co-planar architecture near mean motion resonances of 1:3 and 3:4 ($P_{b}=8.88$
days, $P_{c}=28.58$ days, and $P_{d}=38.35$ days). The HD 191939 system is an excellent candidate
for precise mass determinations of the planets with high-resolution spectroscopy due to the host
star's brightness and low chromospheric activity. Moreover, the system's compact and near-resonant
nature can provide an independent way to measure planetary masses via transit timing variations
while also enabling dynamical and evolutionary studies. Finally, as a prime target for transmission
spectroscopy of all three planets' atmospheres, HD 191939 can offer a unique insight into multiple
sub-Neptunes born from a proto-planetary disk that may have resembled that of the early Sun.
