We present optical IFU observations of the Taffy system (UGC 12914/15); so named because of the radio
emission that stretches between the two galaxies. Given that these gas rich galaxies are believed
to have recently collided head-on, the pair exhibits a surprisingly normal total (sub-LIRG) IR
luminosity ($\mathrm{L_{FIR} \sim 4.5 \times 10^{10}}$ L$_\odot$). Previous observations have
demonstrated that a large quantity of molecular and neutral gas have been drawn out of the galaxies
into a massive multi-phase bridge, consistent with numerical models of the near face-on, counter-rotating
collision. We present, for the first time, spatially resolved spectroscopy of the ionized gas in
the system. The results show that the ionized gas is highly disturbed kinematically, with gas spread
in two main filaments between the two galaxies. The line profiles exhibit widespread double components
found in both the bridge and parts of the disks of the galaxies. Deep Balmer absorption (perhaps a
post-starburst relic of the collision) is also seen in the outer ring of UGC 12914, and over part of
the main disk of UGC 12915. We have investigated the spatial distribution of the excitation properties
of the ionized gas using emission-line diagnostic diagrams, and conclude that large quantities
(up to 40$\%$) of the emission from the entire system is consistent with gas heated in $\sim$200 km
s$^{-1}$ shocks. While the shocked gas is mainly associated with regions in the bridge, there is
a significant amount of shocked gas associated with both galaxies. The results confirm other multi-wavelength
indicators that suggest that the effects of shocks and turbulence can continue to be felt in a high-speed
galaxy collision long after the collision has occurred. The persistence of shocks in the Taffy system
may explain the relatively low current star formation rates in the system as a whole.
