The late time accelerated expansion of the Universe demands that even in local galactic-scales
it is desirable to study astrophysical phenomena, particularly relativistic accretion related
phenomena in massive galaxies or in galaxy mergers and the dynamics of the kiloparsecs-scale structure
and beyond, in the local-galaxies in Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SDS) background, rather than in
Schwarzschild or Newtonian paradigm. Owing to the complex and nonlinear character of the underlying
magnetohydrodynamical equations in general relativistic (GR) regime, it is quite useful to have
an Newtonian analogous potential containing all the important GR features that allows to treat
the problem in Newtonian framework for study of accretion and its related processes. From the principle
of conserved Hamiltonian of the test particle motion, here, a three dimensional Newtonian analogous
potential has been obtained in spherical geometry corresponding to SDS/Schwarzschild anti-de
Sitter (SADS) spacetime, that reproduces almost all of the GR features in its entirety with remarkable
accuracy. The derived potential contains an explicit velocity dependent term of the test particle
that renders an approximate relativistic modification of Newtonian like potential. The complete
orbital dynamics around SDS geometry and the epicyclic frequency corresponding to SDS metric have
been extensively studied in the Newtonian framework using the derived potential. Applying the
derived analogous potential it is found that the current accepted value of $\Lambda \sim 10^{-56}
\rm cm^{-2}$ moderately influences both sonic radius as well as Bondi accretion rate, especially
for spherical accretion with smaller values of adiabatic constant and temperature, which might
have interesting consequences on the stability of accretion disk in AGNs/radio galaxies.
