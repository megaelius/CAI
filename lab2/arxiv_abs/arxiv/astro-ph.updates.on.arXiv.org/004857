We present a new method to estimate redshift distributions and galaxy-dark matter bias model parameters
(gdmbm) using correlation functions in a fully data driven manner. Unlike other machine learning,
template methods, or correlation redshift methods, this approach does not require a reference
sample with known redshifts. By measuring the projected cross- and auto- correlations of different
galaxy sub-samples, e.g., chosen by cells in color-magnitude space, we estimate the gdmbm parameters,
and the shape of the redshift distributions of each sub-sample. This method fully marginalises
over a flexible parameterisation of the redshift distribution and gdmbm parameters of sub-samples
of galaxies, and thus provides a general Bayesian framework to incorporate redshift uncertainty
into the cosmological analysis. The constraints are improved by an order of magnitude by including
cross- correlations with the CMB and with galaxy-galaxy lensing. We showcase how this method works
using galaxies drawn from the MICE simulations, and from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Using idealised
simulations in which all gdmbm parameters and redshift distributions are known, this method recovers
important quantities, such as the offset between the mean of the true and estimated redshift distribution
at (7+-7)x10^(-4), and the 68% and 99.5% widths of the distributions at 1.1+-1.8%, 6.1+-3.6%. This
method can be used for distributions of galaxies for which representative spectra are either unavailable,
or if there is no redshift overlap with a reference sample. This method can naturally incorporate
any information for any of the galaxy sub samples, such as either redshifts, and/or gdmbm parameter
values, by either initialising the starting position of the chains during the exploration of the
high dimensional parameter space, or as priors.
