Context: Homogeneous investigations of red giant stars in open clusters contribute to studies
of internal evolutionary mixing processes inside stars, which are reflected in abundances of mixing-sensitive
chemical elements like carbon, nitrogen, and sodium, while alpha- and neutron-capture element
abundances are useful in tracing the Galactic chemical evolution. Aims: The main aim of this study
is a comprehensive chemical analysis of red giant stars in the open cluster IC 4756, including determinations
of 12C/13C and C/N abundance ratios, and comparisons of the results with theoretical models of stellar
and Galactic chemical evolution. Methods: We used a classical differential model atmosphere method
to analyse high-resolution spectra obtained with the FEROS spectrograph on the 2.2m MPG/ESO Telescope.
The carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen abundances, 12C/13C ratios, and neutron-capture element abundances
were determined using synthetic spectra, and the main atmospheric parameters and abundances of
other chemical elements were determined from equivalent widths of spectral lines. Results: We
have determined abundances of 23 chemical elements for 13 evolved stars and 12C/13C ratios for six
stars of IC 4756. The mean metallicity of this cluster, as determined from nine definite member stars,
is very close to solar - [Fe/H] = -0.02 +/- 0.01. Abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and sodium exhibit
alterations caused by extra-mixing: the mean 12C/13C ratio is lowered to 19 +/- 1.4, the C/N ratio
is lowered to 0.79 +/- 0.05, and the mean [Na/Fe] value, corrected for deviations from the local thermodynamical
equilibrium encountered, is enhanced by 0.14 +/- 0.05 dex. We compared our results to those by other
authors with theoretical models.
