The detection of GW170817 and the identification of its host galaxy have allowed for the first standard-siren
measurement of the Hubble constant, with an uncertainty of $\sim$14%. As more detections of binary
neutron stars with redshift measurement are made, the uncertainty will shrink. The dominating
factors will be the number of joint detections and the uncertainty on the luminosity distance of
each event. Neutron star black hole mergers are also promising sources for advanced LIGO and Virgo.
If the black hole spin induces precession of the orbital plane, the degeneracy between luminosity
distance and the orbital inclination is broken, leading to a much better distance measurement.
In addition neutron star black hole sources are observable to larger distances, owing to their higher
mass. Neutron star black holes could also emit electromagnetic radiation: depending on the black
hole spin and on the mass ratio, the neutron star can be tidally disrupted resulting in electromagnetic
emission. We quantify the distance uncertainty for a wide range of black hole mass, spin and orientations
and find that the 1-sigma statistical uncertainty can be up to a factor of $\sim$10 better than for
a non-spinning binary neutron star merger with the same signal-to-noise ratio. The better distance
measurement, the larger gravitational-wave detectable volume, and the potentially bright electromagnetic
emission, imply that spinning black hole neutron star binaries can be the optimal standard siren
sources as long as their astrophysical rate is larger than $\sim 10\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$,
a value allowed by current astrophysical constraints.
