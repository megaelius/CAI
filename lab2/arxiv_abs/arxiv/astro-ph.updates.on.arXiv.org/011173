To extract the information that the Mg II NUV spectra (observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph;
IRIS), carries about the chromosphere during solar flares, and to validate models of energy transport
via model-data comparison, forward modelling is required. The assumption of statistical equilibrium
is typically used to obtain the atomic level populations from snapshots of flare atmospheres, due
to computational necessity. However it is possible that relying on statistical equilibrium could
lead to spurious results. We compare solving the atomic level populations via statistical equilibrium
versus a non-equilibrium time-dependent approach. This was achieved using flare simulations
from RADYN alongside the minority species version, MS_RADYN, from which the time-dependent Mg
II atomic level populations and radiation transfer were computed in complete frequency redistribution.
The impacts on the emergent profiles, lightcurves, line ratios, and formation heights are discussed.
In summary we note that non-equilibrium effects during flares are typically important only in the
initial stages and for a short period following the cessation of the energy injection. An analysis
of the timescales of ionisation equilibrium reveals that for most of the duration of the flare, when
the temperatures and densities are sufficiently enhanced, the relaxation timescales are short
($\tau_{\mathrm{relax}}<0.1$ s), so that the equilibrium solution is an adequate approximation.
These effects vary with the size of the flare, however. In weaker flares effects can be more pronounced.
We recommend that non-equilibrium effects be considered when possible, but that statistical equilibrium
is sufficient at most stages of the flare.
