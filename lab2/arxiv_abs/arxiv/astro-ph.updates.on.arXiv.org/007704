When modeling and interpreting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies, the simple
stellar population (SSP) model, star formation history (SFH) and dust attenuation law (DAL) are
three of the most important components. However, each of them carries significant uncertainties
which have seriously limited our ability to reliably recover the physical properties of galaxies
from the analysis of their SEDs. In this paper, we present a Bayesian framework to deal with these
uncertain components simultaneously. Based on the Bayesian evidence, a quantitative implement
of the principle of Occam's razor, the method allows a more objective and quantitative discrimination
among the different assumptions about these uncertain components. With a Ks-selected sample of
5467 low-redshift (mostly with $z\lesssim 1$) galaxies in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field and classified
into passively evolving galaxies (PEGs) and star-forming galaxies (SFGs) with UVJ diagram, we
present a Bayesian discrimination of a set of 16 SSP models from five research groups (BC03 and CB07,
M05, GALEV, Yunnan-II, BPASS V2.0), five forms of SFH (Burst, Constant, Exp-dec, Exp-inc, Delayed-$\tau$),
and four kinds of DAL (Calzetti law, MW, LMC, SMC). We show that the results obtained with the method
are either obvious or understandable in the context of galaxy physics. We conclude that the Bayesian
model comparison method, especially that for a sample of galaxies, is very useful for discriminating
the different assumptions in the SED modeling of galaxies. The new version of the BayeSED code, which
is used in this work, is publicly available at https://bitbucket.org/hanyk/bayesed/.
