The formation and dynamical history of hot Jupiters is currently debated, with wide stellar binaries
having been suggested as a potential formation pathway. Additionally, contaminating light from
both binary companions and unassociated stars can significantly bias the results of planet characterisation
studies, but can be corrected for if the properties of the contaminating star are known. We search
for binary companions to known transiting exoplanet host stars, in order to determine the multiplicity
properties of hot Jupiter host stars. We also characterise unassociated stars along the line of
sight, allowing photometric and spectroscopic observations of the planetary system to be corrected
for contaminating light. We analyse lucky imaging observations of 97 Southern hemisphere exoplanet
host stars, using the Two Colour Instrument on the Danish 1.54m telescope. For each detected companion
star, we determine flux ratios relative to the planet host star in two passbands, and measure the
relative position of the companion. The probability of each companion being physically associated
was determined using our two-colour photometry. A catalogue of close companion stars is presented,
including flux ratios, position measurements, and estimated companion star temperature. For
companions that are potential binary companions, we review archival and catalogue data for further
evidence. For WASP-77AB and WASP-85AB, we combine our data with historical measurements to determine
the binary orbits, showing them to be moderately eccentric and inclined to the line of sight and planetary
orbital axis. Combining our survey with the similar Friends of Hot Jupiters survey, we conclude
that known hot Jupiter host stars show a deficit of high mass stellar companions compared to the field
star population; however, this may be a result of the biases in detection and target selection by
ground-based surveys.
