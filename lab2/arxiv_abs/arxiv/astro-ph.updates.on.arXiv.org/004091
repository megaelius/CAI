We present the first constraints on stellar mass-to-light ratio gradients in an early-type galaxy
(ETG) using multiple dynamical tracer populations to model the dark and luminous mass structure
simultaneously. We combine the kinematics of the central starlight, two globular cluster populations
and satellite galaxies in a Jeans analysis to obtain new constraints on M87's mass structure, employing
a flexible mass model which allows for radial gradients in the stellar mass-to-light ratio. We find
that, in the context of our model, a radially declining stellar-mass-to-light ratio is strongly
favoured. Modelling the stellar mass-to-light ratio as following a power law, $\Upsilon_{\star}
\sim R^{-\mu}$, we infer a power-law slope $\mu = -0.54 \pm 0.05$; equally, parameterising the stellar-mass-to-light
ratio via a central mismatch parameter relative to a Salpeter IMF, $\alpha$, and scale radius $R_M$,
we find $\alpha > 1.48$ at $95\%$ confidence and $R_M = 0.35 \pm 0.04$ kpc. We use stellar population
modelling of high-resolution 11-band HST photometry to show that such a steep gradient cannot be
achieved by variations in only the metallicity, age, dust extinction and star formation history
if the stellar initial mass function (IMF) remains spatially constant. On the other hand, the stellar
mass-to-light ratio gradient that we find is consistent with an IMF whose inner slope changes such
that it is Salpeter-like in the central $\sim 0.5$ kpc and becomes Chabrier-like within the stellar
effective radius. This adds to recent evidence that the non-universality of the IMF in ETGs may be
confined to their core regions, and points towards a picture in which the stars in these central regions
may have formed in fundamentally different physical conditions.
