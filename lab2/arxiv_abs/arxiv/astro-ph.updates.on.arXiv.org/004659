We present a novel study of dust-vortex evolution in global two-fluid disk simulations to elucidate
if strong evolution of dust-to-gas ratios can occur even in a regime of well-coupled grains with
low Stokes numbers ($St=10^{-3}-{4\times 10^{-2}}$). We design a new implicit scheme in the code
RoSSBi, to overcome the short timesteps occurring for small grain sizes. We also discover that the
linear capture phase occurs self-similarly for all grain sizes, with an intrinsic timescale (characterizing
the vortex lifetime) scaling as $1/St$. After vortex dissipation, the formation of a disk-wide
turbulent dust ring is a generic outcome confirming our previous results obtained for larger grains.
We propose a novel scenario in which, irrespective of grain size, multiple pathways can lead to local
dust-to-gas ratios order unity and above on relatively short timescales, $< 10^5$ yr, in presence
of a vortex, even with $St=10^{-3}$. When $St>10^{-2}$, the vortex is quickly dissipated by two-fluid
instabilities, and large dust density enhancements form in the global disk-wide dust ring. When
$St<10^{-2}$, the vortex is resilient to destabilization and dust concentrations occur locally,
as a result of turbulence developing inside the vortex. In both cases, dust-to-gas ratios in the
range $1-10$, a necessary condition to trigger a subsequent streaming instability, or even a direct
gravitational instability of the dust clumps, appears to be an inevitable outcome. While the quantitative
connection with such other instabilities will have to be studied, we argue that our results strongly
support a new scenario of vortex-driven planetesimal formation.
