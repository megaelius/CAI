Multi-wavelength time-resolved observations of rotationally modulated variability from brown
dwarfs and giant exoplanets are the most effective method for constraining their heterogeneous
atmospheric structures. In a companion paper (Bowler et al. 2020), we reported the discovery of
strong near-infrared variability in HST/WFC3/G141 light curves of the very red L-dwarf companion
VHS J1256-1257b. In this paper, we present a follow-up 36-hr Spitzer/IRAC Channel 2 light curve
together with an in-depth analysis of the HST and the Spitzer data. The combined dataset provides
time-resolved light curves of VHS1256b sampling 1.1 to 4.5 $\mu$m. The Spitzer light curve is best-fit
with a single sine wave with a period of $22.04\pm0.05$ hr and a peak-to-peak amplitude of $5.76\pm0.04$%.
Combining the period with a previously measured projected rotational velocity ($v\sin i$), we
find that VHS1256b is most consistent with equatorial viewing geometry. The HST/G141+Spitzer
spectral energy distribution favors a $T_{\rm eff}$ of 1000~K, low surface gravity model with disequilibrium
chemistry. The spectral variability of VHS1256b is consistent with predictions from partly cloudy
models, suggesting heterogeneous clouds are the dominant source of the observed modulations.
We find evidence at the $3.3\sigma$ level for amplitude variations within the 1.67$\mu$m CH$_{4}$
band, which is the first such detection for a variable L-dwarf. We compare the HST/G141 time-resolved
spectra of three red L-dwarfs with high-amplitude near-infrared rotational modulations and find
that although their time-averaged spectra are similar, their spectroscopic variabilities exhibit
notable differences. This diversity reinforces the advantage of time-resolved spectroscopic
observations for understanding the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and directly-imaged exoplanets.
