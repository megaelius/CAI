The interaction between inflowing gas clouds and galactic outflows at the interface where the galactic
disk transitions into the circumgalactic medium is an important process in galaxy fueling, yet
remains poorly understood. Using a series of tall-box hydrodynamic ENZO simulations, we have studied
the interaction between smooth gas inflow and supernovae-driven outflow at the disk-halo interface
with pc-scale resolution. A realistic wind of outflowing material is generated by supernovae explosions
in the disk, while inflowing gas is injected at the top boundary of the simulation box with an injection
velocity ranging from $10-100 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$. We find that cooling and hydrodynamic instabilities
drive the injected gas to fragment into cold ($\sim 10^{3}$ K) cloud clumps with typical densities
of $\sim 1 \rm \ cm^{-3}$. These clumps initially accelerate before interacting and partially mixing
with the outflow and decelerating to velocities in the 50-100 $\rm km \ s^{-1}$ range. When the gas
clumps hit the disk, $10\%-50 \%$ of the injected material is able to accrete (depending on the injection
velocity). Clumps originating from gas injected with a higher initial velocity approach the disk
with greater ram pressure, allowing them to penetrate through the disk in low density regions. We
use (equilibrium) CLOUDY photoionization models to generate absorption and emission signatures
of gas accretion, finding that our mock HI and H$\alpha$ observables are prominent and generally
consistent with measurements in the Milky Way. We do not predict enhanced emission/absorption
for higher ionization states such as OVI.
