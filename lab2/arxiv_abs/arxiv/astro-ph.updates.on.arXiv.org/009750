We present VLT-SINFONI near infra-red spectra of 26 new heavily reddened quasar candidates selected
from the UKIDSS-LAS, VISTA VHS and VIKING imaging surveys. This new sample extends our reddened
quasar search to both brighter and fainter luminosities. 25 of the 26 candidates are confirmed to
be broad line quasars with redshifts $0.7<z<2.6$ and dust extinctions $0.5<E(B-V)<3.0$. Combining
with previously identified samples, we study the H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and [OIII] emission line
properties in 22 heavily reddened quasars with $L_{bol}\approx 10^{47}$ erg/s and $z>2$. We present
the first comparison of the [OIII] line properties in high luminosity obscured quasars to a large
sample of 111 unobscured quasars in the same luminosity and redshift range. Broad wings extending
to velocities of 2500 km/s are seen in the [OIII] emission line profiles of our reddened quasars,
suggesting that strong outflows are affecting the ionised gas kinematics. However, we find no significant
difference between the kinematics of the [OIII] emission in reddened and unobscured quasars when
the two samples are matched in luminosity and redshift. Our results are consistent with a model where
quasar-driven outflows persist for some time after the obscuring dust has been cleared from along
the line of sight. Assuming the amount of ionised gas in obscured and unobscured quasars is similar,
we use the equivalent width distribution of the [OIII] emission to constrain the location of the
obscuring dust in our reddened quasars. We find that the dust is most likely to be located on galactic
scales, outside the [OIII] emitting region.
