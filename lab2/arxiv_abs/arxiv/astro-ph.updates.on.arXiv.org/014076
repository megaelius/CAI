Photometric and astrometric monitoring of directly imaged exoplanets will deliver unique insights
into their rotational periods, the distribution of cloud structures, weather, and orbital parameters.
As the host star is occulted by the coronagraph, a speckle grid (SG) is introduced to serve as astrometric
and photometric reference. Speckle grids are implemented as diffractive pupil-plane optics that
generate artificial speckles at known location and brightness. Their performance is limited by
the underlying speckle halo caused by evolving uncorrected wavefront errors. The speckle halo
will interfere with the coherent SGs, affecting their photometric and astrometric precision.
Our aim is to show that by imposing opposite amplitude or phase modulation on the opposite polarization
states, a SG can be instantaneously incoherent with the underlying halo, greatly increasing the
precision. We refer to these as vector speckle grids (VSGs). We derive analytically the mechanism
by which the incoherency arises and explore the performance gain in idealised simulations under
various atmospheric conditions. We show that the VSG is completely incoherent for unpolarized
light and that the fundamental limiting factor is the cross-talk between the speckles in the grid.
In simulation, we find that for short-exposure images the VSG reaches a $\sim$0.3-0.8\% photometric
error and $\sim$$3-10\cdot10^{-3}$ $\lambda/D$ astrometric error, which is a performance increase
of a factor $\sim$20 and $\sim$5, respectively. Furthermore, we outline how VSGs could be implemented
using liquid-crystal technology to impose the geometric phase on the circular polarization states.
The VSG is a promising new method for generating a photometric and astrometric reference SG that
has a greatly increased astrometric and photometric precision.
