Context. Recently, new sub-classes of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) were discovered, including SNe
Iax. The suggested progenitors of SNe Iax are relatively massive, possibly hybrid C+O+Ne white
dwarfs, which can cause white dwarf winds at low metallicities. There is another class that can potentially
occur at low or zero metallicities; sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions in single and/or double
degenerate systems of standard C+O white dwarfs. These explosions have different nucleosynthesis
yields compared to the normal, Chandrasekhar mass explosions. Aims. We test these SN Ia channels
using their characteristic chemical signatures. Methods. The two sub-classes of SNe Ia are expected
to be rarer than normal SNe Ia and do not affect the chemical evolution in the solar neighbourhood;
however, because of the shorter delay time and/or weaker metallicity dependence, they could influence
the evolution of metalpoor systems. Therefore, we have included both in our stochastic chemical
evolution model for the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Ursa Minor. Results. The model predicts a butterfly-shape
spread in [Mn/Fe] in the interstellar medium at low metallicity and - at the same time - a decrease
of [alpha/Fe] ratios at lower [Fe/H] than in the solar neighbourhood, both of which are consistent
with the observed abundances in stars of Ursa Minor. Conclusions. The surprising agreement between
our models and available observations provides a strong indication of the origins of these new sub-classes
of SNe Ia. This outcome requires confirmation by future abundance measurements of manganese in
stars of other satellite galaxies of ourMilkyWay. It will be vital for this project to measure not
the most extreme metal-poor tail, as more commonly happens, but the opposite; the metal-rich end
of dwarf spheroidals.
