Angular fluctuations of the Near InfraRed Background (NIRB) intensity are observed up to scales
$\simlt 1^{\ensuremath{^{\circ}}}$. Their interpretation is challenging as even after removing
the contribution from detected sources, the residual signal is $>10$ times higher than expected
from distant galaxies below the detection limit and first stars. We propose here a novel interpretation
in which early, intermediate mass, accreting direct collapse black holes (DCBH), which are too
faint to be detected individually in current surveys, could explain the observed fluctuations.
We find that a population of highly obscured ($N_{\rm H}\simgt 10^{25} \rm cm^{-2}$) DCBHs formed
in metal-free halos with virial temperature $10^4$ K at $z\simgt 12$, can explain the observed level
$\approx 10^{-3}$ (nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1})^2$ of the 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m fluctuations on scales $>100''$.
The signal on smaller scales is instead produced by undetected galaxies at low and intermediate
redshifts. Albeit Compton-thick, at scales $\theta> 100''$ DCBHs produce a CXB (0.5-2 keV)-NIRB
($4.5 \rm \mu m$) cross-correlation signal of $\simeq 10^{-11}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ nW m$^{-2}$
sr$^{-1}$ slightly dependent on the specific value of the absorbing gas column ($N_{\rm H} \approx
10^{25} \rm cm^{-2}$) adopted and in agreement with the recent measurements by \cite{2012arXiv1210.5302C}.
At smaller scales the cross-correlation is dominated by the emission of high-mass X-ray binaries
(HMXB) hosted by the same low-$z$, undetected galaxies accounting for small scale NIRB fluctuations.
These results outline the great potential of the NIRB as a tool to investigate the nature of the first
galaxies and black holes.
