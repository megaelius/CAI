Young massive stars in the halo are supposed to be runaway stars from the Galactic disk. Possible
ejection scenarios are binary supernova ejections (BSE) or dynamical ejections from star clusters
(DE). Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are extreme runaway stars that are potentially unbound to the
Galaxy. Powerful acceleration mechanisms like the tidal disruption of a binary by a supermassive
black hole are required. Hence, HVSs are believed to originate in the Galactic center (GC). Gaia
DR2 offers the opportunity to study HVSs in an unprecedented manner. We revisit the most interesting
HVSs, i.e., 15 stars for which proper motions with the Hubble Space Telescope were obtained in the
pre-Gaia era, to unravel their origin. By carrying out kinematic analyses in three different Galactic
mass models, kinematic properties are obtained that help to constrain the spatial origins of the
HVSs. While HVSs previously considered unbound remain unbound in two Galactic potentials, most
stars become bound in the most massive Galactic model. For nine stars (including five unbound candidates),
the GC can be ruled out as spatial origin at $2\sigma$ confidence. Using optical and infrared photometry
to determine its spectrophotometric distance, we confirm that HVS3 originates in the Large Magellanic
Cloud. Our results suggest that a large fraction of the HVSs are actually disk runaway stars launched
close to or beyond Galactic escape velocities. Population synthesis models predict that only a
small fraction of the HVSs stems from BSE. Furthermore, a maximum ejection velocity of 540\,km/s
is predicted for BSE and a similar limit has been found for DE. The ejection velocities of five of our
non-GC HVSs are close to or above this limit, calling for the existence of another dynamical ejection
mechanism (e.g., massive perturbers such as intermediate mass black holes) besides the classical
scenarios mentioned above.
