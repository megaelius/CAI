One mechanism for the external destruction of protoplanetary discs in young dense clusters is tidal
disruption during the flyby of another cluster member. The degree of mass loss in such an encounter
depends, among other parameters, on the distribution of the material within the disc. Previous
work showed that this is especially so in encounters that truncate large parts of the outer disc.
The expectation is that the number of completely destroyed discs in a cluster depends also on the
mass distribution within the discs. Here we test this hypothesis by determining the influence of
encounters on the disc fraction and average disc mass in clusters of various stellar densities for
different mass distributions in the discs. This is done by performing Nbody6 simulation of a variety
of cluster environments, where we track the encounter dynamics and determine the mass loss due to
these encounters for different disc-mass distributions. We find that although the disc mass distribution
has a significant impact on the disc losses for specific star-disc encounters, the overall disc
frequency generally remains rather unaffected. The reason is that in single encounters the dependence
on the mass distribution is strongest if both stars have very different masses. Such encounters
are rather infrequent in sparse clusters. In dense clusters such encounters are more common, however,
here the disc frequency is largely determined by encounters between low-mass stars such that the
overall disc frequency does not change significantly. For tidal disruption the disc destruction
in clusters is fairly independent of the actual distribution of the material in the disc. The all
determining factor remains the cluster density.
