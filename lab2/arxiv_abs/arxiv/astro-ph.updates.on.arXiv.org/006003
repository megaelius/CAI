Stars are commonly formed in binary systems, which provide a natural laboratory for studying planet
formation in extreme conditions. In our first paper (Paper I) of a series Xie et al. (2011), we have
shown that the intermediate stage - from planetesimals to planetary embryos/cores - of planet formation
can proceed even in highly inclined binaries. Following Paper I, here we numerically study the late
stage of terrestrial planet formation, i.e., from embryos to full planets, in binary systems of
various orbital configurations. We identify an orbital alignment or anti-alignment effect; namely,
although an inclined binary generally misaligns the planetary orbits with respect to the spin axis
of the primary host star (i.e., causing large obliquity), it could align or anti-align the planetary
orbits with respect to the binary orbit. Such an orbital (anti-)alignment effect is caused by the
combination of orbital differential precession and self-damping, and it is mostly significant
in cases of intermediate binary separations, i.e., a_B~40-200 AU for terrestrial planet formation
around 1 AU from the primary stars. In such intermediate separation binaries, somewhat contrary
to intuition, the binary companion can aid planet growth by having increased the rate of collisions,
forming significantly more massive but fewer planets. In the other two ends, the companion is ether
too close thus plays a violently disruptive role or too wide to have significant effect on planet
formation. Future observations, which can discover more planet-bearing binary star systems and
constrain their masses and 3-D orbital motions will test our numerical findings.
