Improvements in ground-based, advanced gravitational wave (GW) detectors may allow in the near
future to observe the GW signal of a nearby core-collapse supernova. For the most common type of progenitors,
likely with slowly rotating cores, the dominant GW emission mechanisms are the post-bounce oscillations
of the proto-neutron star (PNS) before the explosion. We present a new procedure to compute the eigenmodes
of the system formed by the PNS and the stalled accretion shock in general relativity including spacetime
perturbations. The new method improves on previous results by accounting for perturbations of
both the lapse function and the conformal factor. We apply our analysis to two numerical core-collapse
simulations and show that our improved method is able to obtain eigenfrequencies that accurately
match the features observed in the GW signal and to predict the qualitative behaviour of quasi-radial
oscillations. Our analysis is possible thanks to a newly developed algorithm to classify the computed
eigenmodes in different classes (f-, p-, and g-modes), improving previous results which suffered
from misclassification issues. We find that most of the GW energy is stored in the lowest order eigenmodes,
in particular in the $^2g_1$ mode and in the $^2f$ mode. Our results also suggest that a low-frequency
component of the GW signal attributed in previous works to the characteristic frequency of the Standing
Accretion Shock Instability should be identified as the fundamental quadrupolar f-mode. We also
develop a formalism to estimate the contribution of quasi-radial ($l=0$) modes to the quadrupolar
component of the GW emission in the case of a deformed background, with application to rapidly rotating
cores. This work provides further support for asteroseismology of core-collapse supernovae and
the inference of PNS properties based on GW observations.
