Observations show a prevalence of high redshift galaxies with large stellar masses and predominantly
passive stellar populations. A variety of processes have been suggested that could reduce the star
formation in such galaxies to observed levels, including quasar mode feedback, virial shock heating,
or galactic winds driven by stellar feedback. However, the main quenching mechanisms have yet to
be identified. Here we study the origin of star formation quenching using Argo, a cosmological,
hydrodynamical zoom-in simulation that follows the evolution of a massive galaxy at $z\geq{}2$.
This simulation adopts the same sub-grid recipes of the Eris simulations, which have been shown
to form realistic disk galaxies, and, in one version, adopts also a mass and spatial resolution identical
to Eris. The resulting galaxy has properties consistent with those of observed, massive (M_* ~ 1e11
M_sun) galaxies at z~2 and with abundance matching predictions. Our models do not include AGN feedback
indicating that supermassive black holes likely play a subordinate role in determining masses
and sizes of massive galaxies at high z. The specific star formation rate (sSFR) of the simulated
galaxy matches the observed M_* - sSFR relation at early times. This period of smooth stellar mass
growth comes to a sudden halt at z=3.5 when the sSFR drops by almost an order of magnitude within a few
hundred Myr. The suppression is initiated by a leveling off and a subsequent reduction of the cool
gas accretion rate onto the galaxy, and not by feedback processes. This "cosmological starvation"
occurs as the parent dark matter halo switches from a fast collapsing mode to a slow accretion mode.
Additional mechanisms, such as perhaps radio mode feedback from an AGN, are needed to quench any
residual star formation of the galaxy and to maintain a low sSFR until the present time.
