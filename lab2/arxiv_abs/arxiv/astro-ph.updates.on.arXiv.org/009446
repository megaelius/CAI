The intermediate polar FO Aquarii experienced its first-reported low-accretion states in 2016,
2017, and 2018. We establish that these low states occurred shortly after the system's white dwarf
(WD) began spinning down, after having spent a quarter-century spinning up. FO Aquarii is the only
intermediate polar whose period derivative has undergone a sign change, and it has now done so twice.
By combining our spin-pulse timings with previous data, we determine that the WD's spin period has
varied quasi-sinusoidally since the system's discovery, and an extrapolation predicts that the
white dwarf was spinning down during newly discovered low states in photographic plates from 1964,
1965, and 1974. Thus, FO Aquarii's low states appear to occur exclusively during epochs of spindown.
Additionally, our time-series photometry of the 2016-18 low states reveals that the mode of accretion
is extremely sensitive to the accretion rate; when the system is fainter than V~14.0, the accretion
onto the WD is largely stream-fed, but when it is brighter, it is almost exclusively disk-fed. The
system's grazing eclipse remained detectable throughout all observations, confirming the uninterrupted
presence of a disk-like structure, regardless of the accretion state. Our observations are consistent
with theoretical predictions that during the low states, the accretion disk dissipates into a ring
of diamagnetic blobs. Finally, a new XMM-Newton observation from 2017 indicates that the system's
anomalously soft X-ray spectrum and diminished X-ray luminosity in the wake of the 2016 low state
appear to be long-lasting changes compared to pre-2016 observations.
