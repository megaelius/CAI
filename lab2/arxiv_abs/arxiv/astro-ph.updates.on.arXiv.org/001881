We present the first J-band spectrum of Mrk 231, which reveals a large \ion{He}{1}*$\lambda 10830$
broad absorption line with a profile similar to that of the well-known \ion{Na}{1} broad absorption
line. Combining this spectrum with optical and UV spectra from the literature, we show that the unusual
reddening noted by \citet{veilleux13} is explained by a reddening curve like those previously
used to explain low values of total-to-selective extinction in SNe Ia. The nuclear starburst may
be the origin and location of the dust. Spatially-resolved emission in the broad absorption line
trough suggests nearly full coverage of the continuum emission region. The broad absorption lines
reveal higher velocities in the \ion{He}{1}* lines (produced in the quasar-photoionized \ion{H}{2}
region) compared with the \ion{Na}{1} and \ion{Ca}{2} lines (produced in the corresponding partially-ionized
zone). {\it Cloudy} simulations show that a density increase is required between the \ion{H}{2}
and partially-ionized zones to produce ionic column densities consistent with the optical and
IR absorption line measurements and limits, and that the absorber lies $\sim 100\rm \, pc$ from the
central engine. These results suggest that the \ion{He}{1}* lines are produced in an ordinary quasar
BAL wind that impacts upon, compresses, and accelerates the nuclear starburst's dusty effluent
(feedback in action), and the \ion{Ca}{2} and \ion{Na}{1} lines are produced in this dusty accelerated
gas. This unusual circumstance explains the rarity of \ion{Na}{1} absorption lines; without the
compression along our line of sight, Mrk~231 would appear as an ordinary FeLoBAL.
