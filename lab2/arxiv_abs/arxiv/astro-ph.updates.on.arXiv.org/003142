The duration-luminosity phase space of optical transients is used, mostly heuristically, to compare
various classes of transient events, to explore the origin of new transients, and to influence optical
survey observing strategies. For example, several observational searches have been guided by
intriguing voids and gaps in this phase space. However we should ask: Do we expect to find transients
in these voids given our understanding of the various heating sources operating in astrophysical
transients? In this work, we explore a broad range of theoretical models and empirical relations
to generate optical light curves and to populate the duration-luminosity phase space (DLPS). We
explore transients powered by adiabatic expansion, radioactive decay, magnetar spin-down, and
circumstellar interaction. For each heating source, we provide a concise summary of the basic physical
processes, a physically motivated choice of model parameter ranges, an overall summary of the resulting
light curves and their the occupied range in the DLPS, and how the various model input parameters
affect the light curves. We specifically explore the key voids discussed in the literature: the
intermediate luminosity gap between classical novae and supernovae, and short-duration transients
(<10 days). We find that few physical models lead to transients that occupy these voids. Moreover,
we find that only relativistic expansion can produce fast and luminous transients, while for all
other heating sources, events with durations <10 days are dim (> -15 mag). Finally, we explore the
detection potential of optical surveys (e.g., LSST) in the DLPS and quantify the notion that short-duration
and dim transients are exponentially more difficult to discover in untargeted surveys.
