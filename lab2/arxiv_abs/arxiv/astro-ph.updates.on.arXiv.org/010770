X-ray binaries are cauldrons of fundamental physical processes which appear along practically
the whole electromagnetic spectrum. The sub-class of X-ray transient sources show multifrequency
behaviour which deserve particular attention in order to understand the causing physics. These
binary systems consist of a compact star and an optical star, therefore there is a mutual influence
between these two stars that drive the low energy (LE) (i.e. radio, IR, optical) and high energy (HE)
(i.e. UV, X-ray, $\gamma$-ray) processes. The LE processes are produced mostly on the optical star
and the HE processes mostly on the compact star, typically a neutron star. Thus it appears evident
that through the study of LE processes it is possible to understand also the HE processes and vice
versa. In this paper we will discuss this problem starting from the experimental evidence of a delay
between LE and HE processes detected for the first time in the X-ray/Be system A0535+26/HDE245770
(e.g. Giovannelli \& Sabau-Graziati, 2011; Giovannelli, Bisnovatyi-Kogan \& Klepnev, 2013 (here
after GBK13); Giovannelli et al., 2015b). This delay is common in cataclysmic variables (CVs) and
other binary systems with either a neutron star or a black hole. Since a delay between LE processes
and HE processes has been experimentally observed in several active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we
will discuss also the tidal disruption of stars by massive BHs, following the original idea of Rees
(1998): stars in galactic nuclei can be captured or tidally disrupted by a central black hole. Some
debris would be ejected at high speed, the remainder would be swallowed by the hole, causing a bright
flare lasting at most a few years.
