We present a robust measurement and analysis of the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function
at z=4-8. We use deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging over the CANDELS/GOODS fields, the Hubble Ultra
Deep Field and the Year 1 Hubble Frontier Field deep parallel observations. These surveys provides
an effective volume of 0.6-1.2 x 10^6 Mpc^3 over this epoch, allowing us to perform a robust search
for bright (M_UV < -21) and faint (M_UV=-18) galaxies. We select galaxies using a well-tested
photometric redshift technique with careful screening of contaminants, finding a sample of 7446
galaxies at 3.5<z<8.5, with >1000 galaxies at z~6-8. We measure the luminosity function
using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to measure robust uncertainties. At the faint end our results
agree with previous studies, yet we find a higher abundance of UV-bright galaxies at z>6, with
M* ~ -21 at z>5, different than that inferred based on previous trends at lower redshift. At z=8,
a single power-law provides an equally good fit to the UV luminosity function, while at z=6 and 7,
an exponential cutoff at the bright-end is moderately preferred. We compare to semi-analytical
models, and find that the lack of evolution in M* is consistent with models where the impact of dust
attenuation on the bright-end of the luminosity function decreases at higher redshift. We measure
the evolution of the cosmic star-formation rate density, correcting for dust attenuation, and
find that it declines as (1+z)^(-4.3 +/- 0.5) at z>4, consistent with observations at z>9.
Our observations are consistent with a reionization history that starts at z>10, completes
at z>6, and reaches a midpoint (x_HII = 0.5) at 6.7<z<9.4. Finally, our observations predict
that the abundance of bright z=9 galaxies is likely higher than previous constraints, though consistent
with recent estimates of bright z~10 galaxies. [abridged]
