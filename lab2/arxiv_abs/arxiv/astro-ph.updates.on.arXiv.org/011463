Hot Jupiters receive intense incident stellar light on their daysides, which drives vigorous atmospheric
circulation that attempts to erase their large dayside-to-nightside flux contrasts. Propagating
waves and instabilities in hot Jupiter atmospheres can cause emergent properties of the atmosphere
to be time-variable. In this work, we study such weather in hot Jupiter atmospheres using idealized
cloud-free general circulation models with double-grey radiative transfer. We find that hot Jupiter
atmospheres can be time-variable at the $\sim 0.1-1\%$ level in globally averaged temperature
and at the $\sim 1-10\%$ level in globally averaged wind speeds. As a result, we find that observable
quantities are also time variable: the secondary eclipse depth can be variable at the $\lesssim
2\%$ level, the phase curve amplitude can change by $\lesssim 1\%$, the phase curve offset can shift
by $\lesssim 5^{\circ}$, and terminator-averaged wind speeds can vary by $\lesssim 2~ \mathrm{km}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.
Additionally, we calculate how the eastern and western limb-averaged wind speeds vary with incident
stellar flux and the strength of an imposed drag that parameterizes Lorentz forces in partially
ionized atmospheres. We find that the eastern limb is blueshifted in models over a wide range of equilibrium
temperature and drag strength, while the western limb is only redshifted if equilibrium temperatures
are $\lesssim1500~\mathrm{K}$ and drag is weak. In general, our results show that the amplitude
of time-variability increases with increasing incident stellar flux and decreasing atmospheric
drag strength. We show that this variability may be observationally detectable in the infrared
through secondary eclipse observations with JWST, phase curve observations with future space
telescopes (e.g., ARIEL), and/or Doppler wind speed measurements with high-resolution spectrographs.
