The Mitchell Spectrograph (a.k.a. VIRUS-P) on the 2.7m Harlan J. Smith telescope at McDonald Observatory
is currently the largest field of view (FOV) integral field unit (IFU) spectrograph in the world
(1.7'x1.7'). It was designed as a prototype for the highly replicable VIRUS spectrograph which
consists of a mosaic of IFUs spread over a 16' diameter FOV feeding 150 spectrographs similar to the
Mitchell. VIRUS will be deployed on the 9.2 meter Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) and will be used to
conduct the HET Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX). Since seeing first light in 2007 the Mitchell Spectrograph
has been widely used, among other things, to study nearby galaxies in the local universe where their
internal structure and the spatial distribution of different physical parameters can be studied
in great detail. These observations have provided important insight into many aspects of the physics
behind the formation and evolution of galaxies and have boosted the scientific impact of the 2.7
meter telescope enormously. Here I review the contributions of the Mitchell Spectrograph to the
study of nearby galaxies, from the investigation of the spatial distribution of dark matter and
the properties of supermassive black holes, to the studies of the process of star formation and the
chemical composition of stars and gas in the ISM, which provide important information regarding
the formation and evolution of these systems. I highlight the fact that wide field integral field
spectrographs on small and medium size telescopes can be powerful cost effective tools to study
the astrophysics of galaxies. Finally I briefly discuss the potential of HETDEX for conducting
studies on nearby galaxies. The survey parameters make it complimentary and competitive to ongoing
and future surveys like SAMI and MANGA.
