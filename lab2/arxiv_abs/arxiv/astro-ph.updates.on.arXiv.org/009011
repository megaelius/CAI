We present a catalog of the redshift estimates and probability distributions for 1366 individual
Long-duration Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs) detected by the Burst And Transient Source Experiment
(BATSE). This result is based on a careful classification and modeling of the population distribution
of BATSE LGRBs in the 5-dimensional space of redshift as well as intrinsic prompt gamma-ray emission
properties: peak luminosity, total isotropic emission, the spectral peak energy, and the intrinsic
duration, while taking into account the detection mechanism of BATSE and sample incompleteness.
The underlying assumption in our modeling approach is that LGRBs trace the Cosmic Star Formation
Rate and that the joint 4-dimensional distribution of the aforementioned prompt gamma-ray emission
properties follows a multivariate log-normal distribution. Our modeling approach enables us
to constrain the redshifts of BATSE LGRBs to average uncertainty ranges of $0.7$ and $1.7$ at $50\%$
and $90\%$ confidence levels, respectively. Our predictions are almost entirely at odds with the
previous estimates of BATSE redshifts based on the phenomenological high-energy correlations,
in particular with the estimates derived from the lag-luminosity and the variability-luminosity
relations. There is, however, a weak but significant correlation of strength $\sim0.26$ between
our predicted redshift estimates and those derived from the hardness-brightness relations. The
discrepancies between the estimates can be explained by the strong influence of sample incompleteness
in shaping the phenomenologically proposed high-energy correlations in the literature. The presented
catalog here can be useful for demographic studies of LGRBs and studies of individual BATSE events.
