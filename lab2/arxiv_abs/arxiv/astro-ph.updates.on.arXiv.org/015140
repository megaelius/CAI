Blazars are relativistic magnetized plasma outflows from supermassive black holes that point
very close to our line of sight. Their emission is nonthermal dominated and highly variable across
the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Relativistic magnetic reconnection has been proposed as
the driver of particle acceleration during blazar flares. While recent particle-in-cell simulations
have self-consistently studied the evolution of magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration
therein, the resulting radiation signatures have not been systematically explored. In particular,
the polarization signatures, which directly reflect the characteristic strongly dynamical magnetic
field evolution during reconnection, have not been carefully investigated. In this paper, we present
a systematic study of radiation and polarization signatures arising from magnetic reconnection
in blazars, based on combined PIC and polarized radiation transfer simulations with various physical
parameters. We identify a harder-when-brighter trend in the spectral evolution. Moreover, higher-frequency
bands tend to flare earlier than lower-frequency bands in the synchrotron spectral component.
Most importantly, polarization signatures appear more variable with higher frequencies. We find
that the temporal polarization variations strongly depends on the guide field strength. Specifically,
reconnection with significant guide field component leads to very high polarization degree that
contradict to typical blazar observations, while large polarization angle rotations are unique
signatures of magnetic reconnection between nearly anti-parallel magnetic field lines. These
rotations are at least $90^o$ and can extend to $>180^o$, and they may rotate in both directions.
These results imply that blazars that have shown large polarization angle rotations intrinsically
have more nearly anti-parallel magnetic field morphology.
