Tools for the spectroscopic determination of fundamental stellar parameters should not only comprise
customized solutions for one particular survey or instrument, but, in order to enable cross-survey
comparability, they should also be capable of dealing with spectra from a variety of spectrographs,
resolutions, and wavelength coverages. To meet these ambitious specifications, we developed
ATHOS (A Tool for HOmogenizing Stellar parameters), a fundamentally new analysis tool that adopts
computationally inexpensive analytical relations tying flux ratios (FRs) of designated wavelength
regions in optical spectra to the stellar parameters effective temperature ($T_\mathrm{eff}$),
iron abundance ([Fe/H]), and surface gravity ($\log{g}$). Our $T_\mathrm{eff}$ estimator is
based on FRs from nine pairs of wavelength ranges around the Balmer lines H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$,
while for [Fe/H] and $\log{g}$ we provide 31 and 11 FRs between 4800 {\AA} and 6500 \AA. The analytical
relations employing these FRs were trained on 124 real spectra of a benchmark sample that covers
a large parameter space of $T_{\rm eff}\approx$ 4000 to 6500 K, [Fe/H] $\approx$ -4.5 to 0.3 dex,
and $\log{g}\approx$ 1 to 5 dex, which also reflects ATHOS' range of applicability. The method's
accuracies are merely bounded by finite uncertainties in the training sample parameters, while
its internal precisions can be better by up to 70%. We tested ATHOS on six independent large surveys,
amongst which are the Gaia-ESO and the SDSS/SEGUE surveys. The exceptionally low execution time
(<30 ms/spectrum) together with a comparison to the literature parameters showed that ATHOS can
successfully achieve its main objectives, i.e. fast stellar parameterization with cross-survey
validity, high accuracy, and high precision. These are key to homogenize the output from future
surveys, such as 4MOST or WEAVE. [abridged]
