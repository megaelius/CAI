Accurate prediction of solar activity calls for precise calibration of solar cycle models. Consequently
we aim to find optimal parameters for models which describe the physical processes on the solar surface,
which in turn act as proxies for what occurs in the interior and provide source terms for coronal models.
We use a genetic algorithm to optimize surface flux transport models using National Solar Observatory
(NSO) magnetogram data for Solar Cycle 23. This is applied to both a 1D model that inserts new magnetic
flux in the form of idealized bipolar magnetic regions, and also to a 2D model that assimilates specific
shapes of real active regions. The genetic algorithm searches for parameter sets (meridional flow
speed and profile, supergranular diffusivity, initial magnetic field, and radial decay time)
that produce the best fit between observed and simulated butterfly diagrams, weighted by a latitude-dependent
error structure which reflects uncertainty in observations. Due to the easily adaptable nature
of the 2D model, the optimization process is repeated for Cycles 21, 22, and 24 in order to analyse
cycle-to-cycle variation of the optimal solution. We find that the ranges and optimal solutions
for the various regimes are in reasonable agreement with results from the literature, both theoretical
and observational. The optimal meridional flow profiles for each regime are almost entirely within
observational bounds determined by magnetic feature tracking, with the 2D model being able to accommodate
the mean observed profile more successfully. Differences between models appear to be important
in deciding values for the diffusive and decay terms. In like fashion, differences in the behaviours
of different solar cycles lead to contrasts in parameters defining the meridional flow and initial
field strength.
