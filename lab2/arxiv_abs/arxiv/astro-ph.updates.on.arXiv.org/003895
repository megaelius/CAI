We report detailed investigation of nulling and drifting behavior of two pulsars PSRs J1741-0840
and J1840-0840 observed from the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope at 625 MHz. PSR J1741-840 was found
to show nulling fraction (NF) of around 30(5)% while PSR J1840-0840 was shown to have NF of around
50(6)%. We measured drifting behavior from different profile components in PSR J1840-0840 for
the first time with the leading component showing drifting with 13.5(0.7) periods while the weak
trailing component showed drifting of around 18(1) periods. Large nulling do hamper accuracy of
these quantities derived using standard Fourier techniques. A more accurate comparison was drawn
from driftband slopes, measured after sub-pulse modeling. These measurements revealed interesting
sporadic and irregular drifting behavior in both pulsars. We conclude that the previously reported
different drifting periodicities in the trailing component of PSR J1741-0840 is likely due to the
spread in these driftband slopes. We also find that both components of PSR J1840-0840 show similar
driftband slopes within the uncertainties. Unique nulling-drifting interaction is identified
in PSR J1840-0840 where, in most occasions, the pulsar tends to start nulling after what appears
to be an end of a driftband. Similarly, when the pulsar switches back to an emission phase, in most
occasions it starts at the beginning of a new driftband in both components. Such behaviors have not
been detected in any other pulsars to our knowledge. We also found that PSR J1741-0840 seems to have
no memory of its previous burst phase while PSR J1840-0840 clearly exhibits memory of its previous
state even after longer nulls for both components. We discuss possible explanations for these intriguing
nulling-drifting interactions seen in both pulsars based on various pulsar nulling models.
