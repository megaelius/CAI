The detectability of exoplanets and the determination of their projected mass in radial velocity
are affected by stellar magnetic activity and photospheric dynamics. The effect of granulation,
and even more so of supergranulation, has been shown to be significant in the solar case. Our study
is aimed at quantifying the impact of these flows for other stars and estimating how such contributions
affect their performance. We analysed a broad array of extended synthetic time series that model
these processes for main sequence stars with spectral types from F6 to K4, focusing on Earth-mass
planets orbiting within the habitable zone around those stars. We estimated the expected detection
rates and detection limits, and performed blind tests. We find that both granulation and supergranulation
on these stars significantly affect planet mass characterisation in radial velocity when performing
a follow-up of a transit detection, with uncertainties sometimes below 20% for a 1 MEarth, but much
larger for supergranulation. For granulation and low levels of supergranulation, the detection
rates are good for K and late G stars (if the number of points is large), but poor for more massive stars.
The highest level of supergranulation leads to a very poor performance, even for K stars; this is
both due to low detection rates and to high levels of false positives, even for a very dense temporal
sampling over ten years. False positive levels estimated from standard false alarm probabilities
sometimes significantly overestimate or underestimate the true level, depending on the number
of points. We conclude that granulation and supergranulation significantly affect the performance
of exoplanet detectability. Future works will focus on improving the following aspects: decreasing
the number of false positives, increasing detection rates, and improving the false alarm probability
estimations from observations.
