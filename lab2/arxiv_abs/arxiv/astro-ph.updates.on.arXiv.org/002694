Future weak lensing surveys potentially hold the highest statistical power for constraining cosmological
parameters compared to other cosmological probes. The statistical power of a weak lensing survey
is determined by the sky coverage, the inverse of the noise in shear measurements, and the galaxy
number density. The combination of the latter two factors is often expressed in terms of $n_{\rm
eff}$ -- the "effective number density of galaxies used for weak lensing measurements". In this
work, we estimate $n_{\rm eff}$ for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) project, the most
powerful ground-based lensing survey planned for the next two decades. We investigate how the following
factors affect the resulting $n_{\rm eff}$ of the survey with detailed simulations: (1) survey
time, (2) shear measurement algorithm, (3) algorithm for combining multiple exposures, (4) inclusion
of data from multiple filter bands, (5) redshift distribution of the galaxies, and (6) masking and
blending. For the first time, we quantify in a general weak lensing analysis pipeline the sensitivity
of $n_{\rm eff}$ to the above factors. We find that with current weak lensing algorithms, expected
distributions of observing parameters, and all lensing data ($r$- and $i$-band, covering 18,000
degree$^{2}$ of sky) for LSST, $n_{\rm eff} \approx37$ arcmin$^{-2}$ before considering blending
and masking, $n_{\rm eff} \approx31$ arcmin$^{-2}$ when rejecting seriously blended galaxies
and $n_{\rm eff} \approx26$ arcmin$^{-2}$ when considering an additional 15% loss of galaxies
due to masking. With future improvements in weak lensing algorithms, these values could be expected
to increase by up to 20%. Throughout the paper, we also stress the ways in which $n_{\rm eff}$ depends
on our ability to understand and control systematic effects in the measurements.
