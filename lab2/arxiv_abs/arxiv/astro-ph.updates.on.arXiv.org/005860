State-of-the art photometric measurements of extragalactic Cepheids account for the mean additional
light due to chance superposition of Cepheids on crowded backgrounds through the use of artificial
star measurements. However, light from stars physically associated with Cepheids may bias relative
distance measurements if the changing spatial resolution along the distance ladder significantly
alters the amount of associated blending. We have identified two regimes where this phenomenon
may occur: Cepheids in wide binaries and open clusters. We estimate stellar association bias using
the photometric passbands and reddening-free Wesenheit magnitudes used to set up the distance
scale. For wide binaries, we rely on Geneva stellar evolution models in conjunction with detailed
statistics on intermediate-mass binary stars. For the impact of cluster stars, we have compiled
information on the clustered Cepheid fraction and measured the typical cluster contribution in
M31 via deep HST imaging provided by the PHAT project. We find that the dominant effect on the distance
scale comes from Cepheids in clusters, despite cluster Cepheids being a relatively rare phenomenon.
Wide binaries have a negligible effect of 0.004% on $H_0$ for long-period Cepheids observed in the
near-infrared or when considering Wesenheit magnitudes. We estimate that blending due to cluster
populations has previously resulted in a 0.23% overestimate of $H_0$. Correcting for this bias,
we obtain $H_0 = 73.07 \pm 1.76 km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$, which remains in $3.3\sigma$ tension with the
Planck value. We conclude that stellar association bias does not constitute a limit for measuring
$H_0$ with an accuracy of 1%.
