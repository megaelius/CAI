The Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect produces a secondary temperature anisotropy of CMB. The
main contribution comes from z<2, where dark energy leads to a decay of potentials. As the same
photons are gravitationally lensed by these decaying potentials, there exists a high degree of
correlation between the ISW effect and CMB lensing, leading to a non-zero three-point correlation
(bispectrum) of the observed temperature anisotropy. This ISW-lensing bispectrum, whose shape
resembles that of the so-called "local-form" primordial bispectrum parametrized by fNL, is known
to be the largest contamination of fNL. In order to avoid a spurious detection of primordial non-Gaussianity,
we need to remove the ISW-lensing bias. In this work, we investigate three debiasing methods: (I)
subtraction of an expected, ensemble average of the ISW-lensing bispectrum; (II) subtraction
of a measured ISW-lensing bispectrum; and (III) direct subtraction of an estimated ISW signal from
an observed temperature map. One may use an estimation of the ISW map from external non-CMB data or
that from the CMB data themselves. As the methods II and III are based on fewer assumptions about the
nature of dark energy, they are preferred over the method I. While the methods I and II yield unbiased
estimates of fNL with comparable error bars, the method III yields a biased result when the underlying
primordial fNL is non-zero and the ISW map is estimated from a lensing potential reconstructed from
the observed temperature map. One of the sources of the bias is a lensing reconstruction noise bias
which is independent of fNL and can be calculated precisely, but other fNL-dependent terms are difficult
to compute reliably. We thus conclude that the method II is the best, model-independent way to remove
the ISW-lensing bias of fNL, enabling us to test the physics of inflation with smaller systematic
errors.
