We present synthetic dust polarisation maps of 3D magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of molecular
clouds embedded in their galactic environment performed within the SILCC-Zoom project. The radiative
transfer is carried out with POLARIS for wavelengths from 70 $\mu$m to 3 mm at a resolution of 0.12
pc, and includes self-consistently calculated alignment efficiencies for radiative torque alignment.
We explore the reason of the observed depolarisation in the center of molecular clouds: We find that
dust grains remain well aligned even at high densities ($n$ $>$ 10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$) and visual extinctions
($A_\text{V}$ $>$ 1). The depolarisation is rather caused by strong variations of the magnetic
field direction along the LOS due to turbulent motions. The observed magnetic field structure thus
resembles best the mass-weighted, line-of-sight averaged field structure. Furthermore, it differs
by only a few 1$^\circ$ for different wavelengths and is little affected by the spatial resolution
of the synthetic observations. Noise effects can be reduced by convolving the image. Doing so, for
$\lambda$ $\gtrsim$ 160 $\mu$m the observed magnetic field traces reliably the underlying field
in regions with intensities $I$ $\gtrsim$ 3 times the noise level and column densities above 1 M$_\text{sun}$
pc$^{-2}$. Here, typical deviations are $\lesssim$ 10$^\circ$. The observed structure is less
reliable in regions with low polarisation degrees and possibly in regions with large column density
gradients. Finally, we show that the simplified and widely used method by Wardle & Konigl (1990)
without self-consistent dust alignment efficiencies can provide a good representation of the
observable field structure with deviations below 5$^\circ$.
