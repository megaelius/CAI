We present an observational study of the interaction effect on the dynamics and morphology of the
minor merger AM1219-430. This work is based on r' and g' images and long-slit spectra obtained with
the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph at the Gemini South Telescope. We detected a tidal tail in
the main galaxy (AM1219A) and a bridge of material connecting the galaxies. In luminosity, AM1219A
is about 3.8 times brighter than the secondary (AM1219B). The surface brightness profile of AM1219A
was decomposed into bulge and disc components. The profile shows a light excess of ~ 53 % due to the
contribution of star-forming regions, which is typical of starburst galaxies. On the other hand,
the surface brightness profile of AM1219B shows a lens structure in addition to the bulge and disc.
The scale lengths and central magnitudes of the disc structure of both galaxies agree with the average
values derived for galaxies with no sign of ongoing interaction or disturbed morphology. The S\'ersic
index (n<2), the effective and scale radii of the bulge of both galaxies are typical of pseudo-bulges.
The rotation curve of AM1219A derived from the emission line of ionized gas is quite asymmetric,
suggesting a gas perturbed by interaction. We explore all possible values of stellar and dark matter
masses. The overall best-fitting solution for the mass distribution of AM1219A was found with M/L
for bulge and disc of M/L_b=2.8_-0.4^+0.4 and M/L_d=2.4_-0.2^+0.3, respectively, and a Navarro,
Frenk and White profile of M_200=2.0_-0.4^+0.5 x10^12 M_sun and c=16.0_-1.1^+1.2. The estimated
dynamical mass is 1.6x10^11 M_sun, within a radius of ~ 10.6 kpc.
