We present the Multiscale non-Gaussian Segmentation (MnGSeg) analysis technique. This wavelet
based method combines the analysis of the probability distribution function (PDF) of map fluctuations
as a function of spatial scales and the power spectrum analysis of a map. This technique allows us
to extract the non-Gaussianities identified in the multiscaled PDFs usually associated with turbulence
intermittency and to spatially reconstruct the Gaussian and the non-Gaussian component of the
map. This new technique can be applied on any data set. Here, it is applied on a Herschel column density
map of the Polaris flare cloud. The first component has by construction a self-similar fractal geometry
as the one produced by fractional Brownian motion simulations. The second component is called the
coherent component, by opposition to fractal, and includes a network of filamentary structures
which demonstrates a spatial hierarchical scaling, i.e. filaments inside filaments. The power
spectrum analysis of both components proves that the Fourier power spectrum of the initial map is
dominated by the power of the coherent filamentary structures across almost all spatial scales.
The coherent structures contribute progressively, more and more from large to smaller scales,
without producing any break in the inertial range. We suggest that this behaviour is induced, at
least partly, by inertial-range intermittency, a well known phenomenon for turbulent flows. We
also demonstrate that the MnGSeg technique is a very sensitive signal analysis technique, which
allows the extraction of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) signal present in the Polaris flare
submillimeter observations and the detection of a characteristic scale for 0.1 < l < 0.3 pc whose
origin could partly be the transition of regimes dominated by incompressible turbulence versus
compressible modes and other physical processes, such as gravity.
