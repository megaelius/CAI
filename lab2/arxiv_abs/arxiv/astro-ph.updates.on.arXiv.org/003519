Forward modeling of the full galaxy SED is a powerful technique, providing self-consistent constraints
on stellar ages, star formation rates, dust properties, and metallicities. However, the accuracy
of these results is contingent on the accuracy of the model. One significant source of uncertainty
is the contribution of obscured AGN to the SED, as they are relatively common and can produce substantial
mid-IR (MIR) emission. Here we include emission from dusty AGN torii in the Prospector SED-fitting
framework, and fit the UV-IR broadband photometry of 129 nearby galaxies. We find that 10% of the
fitted galaxies host an AGN contributing at least 10% of the total observed MIR luminosity. We demonstrate
the necessity of this AGN component in the following ways. First, we compare observed spectral features
to spectral features predicted from our model fit to the photometry. We find that the AGN component
greatly improves predictions for observed H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ luminosities, as well as MIR
$Akari$ and $Spitzer$/IRS spectra. Second, we show that inclusion of the AGN component changes
stellar ages and SFRs by up to a factor of 10, and dust attenuations by up to a factor of 2.5. Finally,
we show that the strength of the AGN component in our model correlates with independent AGN indicators,
including X-ray fluxes, MIR color gradients, emission line ratios, and other published AGN diagnostics.
This evidence strongly implies that these galaxies truly host AGN, and that the full SED modeling
approach is able to detect AGN down to contrasts of of L$_{\mathrm{MIR,AGN}}$/L$_{\mathrm{MIR,tot}}
\sim 0.1$. Notably, only 46% of the SED-detected AGN would be detected with a simple MIR color selection.
Based on these results, we conclude that SED models which do not include AGN when fitting MIR data
are vulnerable to substantial bias in their derived stellar populations parameters.
