The characterization of our Galaxy's longest filamentary gas features has been the subject of several
studies in recent years, producing not only a sizeable sample of large-scale filaments, but also
confusion as to whether all these features (e.g. "Bones", "Giant Molecular Filaments") are the
same. They are not. We undertake the first standardized analysis of the physical properties ($\rm{H_2}\;$column
densities, dust temperatures, morphologies, radial column density profiles) and kinematics
of large-scale filaments in the literature. We expand and improve upon prior analyses by using the
same data sets, techniques, and spiral arm models to disentangle the filaments' inherent properties
from selection criteria and methodology. Our results suggest that the myriad filament finding
techniques are uncovering different physical structures, with length ($11-269\,\rm\,pc$),
width ($1-40\,\rm\,pc$), mass ($\rm3\times10^3\; M_\odot-1.1\times10^{6}\;M_\odot$), aspect
ratio (3:1-117:1), and high column density fraction ($0.2-100\%$) varying by over an order of magnitude
across the sample of 45 filaments. We develop a radial profile fitting code, $\texttt{RadFil}$,
which is publicly available. We also perform a $\textit{position-position-velocity}$ ($\textit{p-p-v}$)
analysis on a subsample and find that while $60-70\%$ lie spatially in the plane of the Galaxy, only
$30-45\%$ concurrently exhibit spatial $\textit{and}$ kinematic proximity to spiral arms. In
a parameter space defined by aspect ratio, dust temperature, and column density, we broadly distinguish
three filament categories, which could indicate different formation mechanisms or histories.
Highly elongated "Bone-like" filaments show the most potential for tracing gross spiral structure
(e.g. arms, spurs), while other categories could be large concentrations of molecular gas (GMCs,
core complexes).
