We present ISM and CGM metallicities for 25 absorption systems associated with isolated star-forming
galaxies (<z>=0.28) with 9.4<log(M*/Msun)<10.9 and with absorption detected within 200kpc.
Galaxy ISM metallicities were measured using Ha/[NII] emission lines from Keck/ESI spectra. CGM
single-phase low-ionization metallicities were modeled using MCMC and Cloudy analysis of absorption
from HST/COS and Keck/HIRES or VLT/UVES quasar spectra. We find that the star-forming galaxy ISM
metallicities follow the observed stellar mass metallicity relation (scatter 0.19dex). CGM metallicity
shows no dependence with stellar mass and exhibits a scatter of ~2dex. All CGM metallicities are
lower than the galaxy ISM metallicities and are offset by log(dZ)=-1.17+/-0.11. There is no obvious
metallicity gradient as a function of impact parameter or virial radius (<2.3 sigma). There is no
relationship between the relative CGM-galaxy metallicity and azimuthal angle. We find the mean
metallicity differences along the major and minor axes are -1.13+/-0.18 and -1.23+/-0.11, respectively.
Regardless of whether we examine our sample by low/high inclination or low/high impact parameter,
or low/high N(HI), we do not find any significant relationship with relative CGM-galaxy metallicity
and azimuthal angle. We find that 10/15 low column density systems (logN(HI)<17.2) reside along
the galaxy major axis while high column density systems (logN(HI)>17.2) reside along the minor
axis. This suggest N(HI) could be a useful indicator of accretion/outflows. We conclude that CGM
is not well mixed, given the range of galaxy-CGM metallicities, and that metallicity at low redshift
might not be a good tracer of CGM processes. Furthermore we should replace integrated line-of-sight,
single phase, metallicities with multi-phase, cloud-cloud metallicities, which could be more
indicative of the physical processes within the CGM.
