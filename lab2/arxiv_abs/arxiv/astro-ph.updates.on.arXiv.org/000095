Of the over 800 exoplanets detected to date, over half are on non-circular orbits, with eccentricities
as high as 0.93. Such orbits lead to time-variable stellar heating, which has implications for the
planet's atmospheric dynamical regime. However, little is known about this dynamical regime,
and how it may influence observations. Therefore, we present a systematic study of hot Jupiters
on highly eccentric orbits using the SPARC/MITgcm, a model which couples a three-dimensional general
circulation model with a plane-parallel, two-stream, non-grey radiative transfer model. In our
study, we vary the eccentricity and orbit-average stellar flux over a wide range. We demonstrate
that the eccentric hot Jupiter regime is qualitatively similar to that of planets on circular orbits;
the planets possess a superrotating equatorial jet and exhibit large day-night temperature variations.
We show that these day-night heating variations induce momentum fluxes equatorward to maintain
the superrotating jet throughout its orbit. As the eccentricity and/or stellar flux is increased,
the superrotating jet strengthens and narrows, due to a smaller Rossby deformation radius. For
a select number of model integrations, we generate full-orbit lightcurves and find that the timing
of transit and secondary eclipse viewed from Earth with respect to periapse and apoapse can greatly
affect what we see in infrared (IR) lightcurves; the peak in IR flux can lead or lag secondary eclipse
depending on the geometry. For those planets that have large day-night temperature variations
and rapid rotation rates, we find that the lightcurves exhibit "ringing" as the planet's hottest
region rotates in and out of view from Earth. These results can be used to explain future observations
of eccentric transiting exoplanets.
