Due to instrumental limitations, the nature of which vary from case to case, spectroscopic galaxy
redshift surveys usually do not collect redshifts for all galaxies in the population of potential
targets. Especially problematic is the entanglement between this incompleteness and the true
cosmological signal, arising from the fact that the proportion of successful observations is typically
lower in regions with higher density of galaxies. The result is a fictitious suppression of the galaxy
clustering that, if not properly corrected, can impact severely on cosmological-parameter inference.
Recent developments in the field have shown that an unbiased estimate of the 2-point correlation
function in the presence of missing observations can be obtained by weighting each pair by its inverse
probability of being targeted. In this work we expand on the concept of probability weights by developing
a more mature statistical formalism, which provides us with a deeper understanding of their fundamental
properties. We take advantage of this novel perspective to handle the problem of estimating the
inverse probability, specifically, we discuss how to efficiently determine the weights from a
finite set of realisations of the targeting and how to model exactly the resulting sampling effects.
This allows us to derive an inverse-probability-based estimator for the power spectrum, which
is the main result of this work, but also to improve robustness and computational efficiency of the
already existing configuration-space estimator. Finally, we propose a strategy to further extend
the concept of inverse probability, providing examples of how traditional missing-observation
countermeasures can be included in this more general picture. The effectiveness of the different
models and weighting schemes discussed in this work is demonstrated using realisations of an idealised
simple survey strategy.
