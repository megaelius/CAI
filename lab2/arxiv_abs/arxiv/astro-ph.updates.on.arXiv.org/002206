STPpol, POLARBEAR and BICEP2 have recently measured the cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode
polarization in various sky regions of several tens of square degrees and obtained BB power spectra
in the multipole range 20-3000, detecting the components due to gravitational lensing and to inflationary
gravitational waves. We analyze jointly the results of these three experiments and propose modifications
of their analysis of the spectra to include in the model, in addition to the gravitational lensing
and the inflationary gravitational waves components, also the effects induced by the cosmic polarization
rotation (CPR), if it exists within current upper limits. Although in principle our analysis would
lead also to new constraints on CPR, in practice these can only be given on its fluctuations <{\delta}{\alpha}^2>,
since constraints on its mean angle are inhibited by the de-rotation which is applied by current
CMB polarization experiments, in order to cope with the insufficient calibration of the polarization
angle. The combined data fits from all three experiments (with 29% CPR-SPTpol correlation, depending
on theoretical model) gives constraint <{\delta}{\alpha}^2>^1/2 < 27.3 mrad (1.56{\deg})
with r = 0.194 \pm 0.033. These results show that the present data are consistent with no CPR detection
and the constraint on CPR fluctuation is about 1.5{\deg}. This method of constraining the cosmic
polarization rotation is new, is complementary to previous tests, which use the radio and optical/UV
polarization of radio galaxies and the CMB E-mode polarization, and adds a new constraint for the
sky areas observed by SPTpol, POLARBEAR and BICEP2.
