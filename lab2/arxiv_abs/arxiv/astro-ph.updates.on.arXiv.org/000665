To determine the local dark matter density (LDMD) of the solar system is a classical problem in astronomy.
Recently, a novel method of determining the LDMD from stellar distribution and vertical velocity
dispersion profiles perpendicular to the Galactic plane was devised. This method has the advantage
of abolishing conventional approximations and using only a few assumptions. Our aims are to carefully
scrutinize this method and to examine influences by uncertainties of astrometric observations.
We discuss how the determinations of the LDMD vary with observational precisions on parallax, proper
motion, and line-of-sight velocity measurements. To examine the influences by the observational
imprecision, we created mock observation data for stars that are dynamical tracers based on an analytical
galaxy model and applied parametrized observational errors to the mock data. We evaluated the accuracy
of determining the LDMD by applying the method to the mock data. In addition, we estimated a sample
size and observational precision required to determine the LDMD with accuracy. We find that the
method is capable of determining the LDMD with accuracy if the sample size and observational precisions
are satisfactory. The random errors of parallaxes and proper motions can cause systematic overestimation
of the LDMD. We estimate the required precisions of the parallax measurements to be approximately
0.1-0.3 milliarcseconds at 1 kpc away from the Sun; the proper motion precisions do not seem to be
as important as the parallaxes. From these results, we expect that using the Hipparcos catalog would
overestimate the LDMD because of the imprecise parallax measurements if this method is applied;
however, we emphasize the capability of the method. We expect that Gaia will provide data precise
enough to determine the LDMD.
