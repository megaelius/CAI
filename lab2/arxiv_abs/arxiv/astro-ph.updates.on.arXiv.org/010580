We report new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 3 (86-100 GHz; $\sim$80 mas angular
resolution) and Band 4 (146-160 GHz; $\sim$50 mas angular resolution) observations of the dust
continuum emission towards the archetypal and ongoing accretion burst young stellar object FU
Ori, which simultaneously covered its companion, FU Ori S. In addition, we present near-infrared
(2-2.45 $\mu$m) observations of FU Ori taken with the General Relativity Analysis via VLT InTerferometrY
(GRAVITY; $\sim$1 mas angular resolution) instrument on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer
(VLTI). We find that the emission in both FU Ori and FU Ori S at (sub)millimeter and near infrared bands
is dominated by structures inward of $\sim$10 au radii. We detected closure phases close to zero
from FU Ori with VLTI/GRAVITY, which indicate the source is approximately centrally symmetric
and therefore is likely viewed nearly face-on. Our simple model to fit the GRAVITY data shows that
the inner 0.4 au radii of the FU Ori disk has a triangular spectral shape at 2-2.45 $\mu$m, which is
consistent with the H$_{2}$O and CO absorption features in a $\dot{M}\sim$10$^{-4}$ $M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$,
viscously heated accretion disk. At larger ($\sim$0.4-10 au) radii, our analysis shows that viscous
heating may also explain the observed (sub)millimeter and centimeter spectral energy distribution
when we assume a constant, $\sim$10$^{-4}$ $M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ mass inflow rate in this region.
This explains how the inner 0.4 au disk is replenished with mass at a modest rate, such that it neither
depletes nor accumulates significant masses over its short dynamic timescale. Finally, we tentatively
detect evidence of vertical dust settling in the inner 10 au of the FU Ori disk, but confirmation requires
more complete spectral sampling in the centimeter bands.
