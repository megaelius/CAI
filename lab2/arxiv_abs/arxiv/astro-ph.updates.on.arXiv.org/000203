[Abridged] We study the spectral properties of intermediate mass galaxies as a function of colour
and morphology. We use Galaxy Zoo to define three morphological classes of galaxies, namely early-types
(ellipticals), late-type (disk-dominated) face-on spirals and early-type (bulge-dominated)
face-on spirals. We classify these galaxies as blue or red according to their SDSS g-r colour and
use the spectral fitting code VESPA to calculate time-resolved star-formation histories, metallicity
and total starlight dust extinction from their SDSS fibre spectra. We find that red late-type spirals
show less star-formation in the last 500 Myr than blue late-type spirals by up to a factor of three,
but share similar star-formation histories at earlier times. This decline in recent star-formation
explains their redder colour: their chemical and dust content are the same. We postulate that red
late-type spirals are recent descendants of blue late-type spirals, with their star-formation
curtailed in the last 500 Myrs. The red late-type spirals are however still forming stars approximately
17 times faster than red ellipticals over the same period. Red early-type spirals lie between red
late-type spirals and red ellipticals in terms of recent-to-intermediate star-formation and
dust content. Therefore, it is plausible that these galaxies represent an evolutionary link between
these two populations. They are more likely to evolve directly into red ellipticals than red late-type
spirals. Blue ellipticals show similar star-formation histories as blue spirals (regardless
of type), except they have formed less stars in the last 100 Myrs. However, blue ellipticals have
different dust content, which peaks at lower extinction values than all spiral galaxies.
