Flat-spectrum radio-quasars (FSRQs) are rarely detected at very-high-energies (VHE; E>100 GeV)
due to their low-frequency-peaked SEDs. At present, only 6 FSRQs are known to emit VHE photons, representing
only 7% of the VHE extragalactic catalog. Following the detection of MeV-GeV gamma-ray flaring
activity from the FSRQ PKS 0736+017 (z=0.189) with Fermi, the H.E.S.S. array of Cherenkov telescopes
triggered ToO observations on February 18, 2015, with the goal of studying the gamma-ray emission
in the VHE band. H.E.S.S. ToO observations were carried out during the nights of February 18, 19,
21, and 24, 2015. Together with Fermi-LAT, the multi-wavelength coverage of the flare includes
Swift observations in soft-X-rays and optical/UV, and optical monitoring (photometry and spectro-polarimetry)
by the Steward Observatory, the ATOM, the KAIT and the ASAS-SN telescope. VHE emission from PKS 0736+017
was detected with H.E.S.S. during the night of February 19, 2015, only. Fermi data indicate the presence
of a gamma-ray flare, peaking at the time of the H.E.S.S. detection, with a flux doubling time-scale
of around six hours. The gamma-ray flare was accompanied by at least a 1 mag brightening of the non-thermal
optical continuum. No simultaneous observations at longer wavelengths are available for the night
of the H.E.S.S. detection. The gamma-ray observations with H.E.S.S. and Fermi are used to put constraints
on the location of the gamma-ray emitting region during the flare: it is constrained to be just outside
the radius of the broad-line-region with a bulk Lorentz factor $\simeq 20$, or at the level of the
radius of the dusty torus with Gamma > 60. PKS 0736+017 is the seventh FSRQ known to emit VHE photons
and, at z=0.189, is the nearest so far. The location of the gamma-ray emitting region during the flare
can be tightly constrained thanks to opacity, variability, and collimation arguments.
