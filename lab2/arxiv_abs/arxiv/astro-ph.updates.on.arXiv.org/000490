We present the results of a search for potential transit signals in the first three years of photometry
data acquired by the Kepler Mission. The targets of the search include 112,321 targets which were
observed over the full interval and an additional 79,992 targets which were observed for a subset
of the full interval. From this set of targets we find a total of 11,087 targets which contain at least
one signal which meets the Kepler detection criteria: those criteria are periodicity of the signal,
an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio, and three tests which reject false positives. Each target
containing at least one detected signal is then searched repeatedly for additional signals, which
represent multi-planet systems of transiting planets. When targets with multiple detections
are considered, a total of 18,406 potential transiting planet signals are found in the Kepler Mission
dataset. The detected signals are dominated by events with relatively low signal-to-noise ratios
and by events with relatively short periods. The distribution of estimated transit depths appears
to peak in the range between 20 and 30 parts per million, with a few detections down to fewer than 10
parts per million. The detections exhibit signal-to-noise ratios from 7.1 sigma, which is the lower
cut-off for detections, to over 10,000 sigma, and periods ranging from 0.5 days, which is the shortest
period searched, to 525 days, which is the upper limit of achievable periods given the length of the
data set and the requirement that all detections include at least 3 transits. The detected signals
are compared to a set of known transit events in the Kepler field of view, many of which were identified
by alternative methods; the comparison shows that the current search recovery rate for targets
with known transit events is 98.3%.
