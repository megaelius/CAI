Near-IR polarimetric images of protoplanetary disks enable us to characterize substructures
that might be due to the interaction with (forming) planets. The available census is strongly biased
toward massive disks around old stars, however. The DARTTS program aims at alleviating this bias
by imaging a large number of T Tauri stars with diverse properties. In this work, we present new SPHERE
images of 21 circumstellar disks, which is the largest sample released to date. The targets of this
work are significantly younger than those published thus far with polarimetric near-IR (NIR) imaging.
Scattered light is unambiguously resolved in 11 targets, and some polarized unresolved signal
is detected in 3 additional sources. Some disk substructures are detected. However, the paucity
of spirals and shadows from this sample reinforces the trend according to which these NIR features
are associated with Herbig stars, either because they are older or more massive. Furthermore, disk
rings that are apparent in ALMA observations of some targets do not appear to have corresponding
detections with SPHERE. Inner cavities larger than 15 au are also absent from our images, even though
they are expected from the spectral energy distribution. On the other hand, 3 objects show extended
filaments at larger scale that are indicative of strong interaction with the surrounding medium.
All but one of the undetected disks are best explained by their limited size (less than 20 au), and
the high occurrence of stellar companions in these sources suggests an important role in limiting
the disk size. One undetected disk is massive and very large at millimeter wavelengths, implying
that it is self-shadowed in the NIR. This work paves the way toward a more complete and less biased
sample of scattered-light observations, which is required to interpret how disk features evolve
throughout the disk lifetime.
