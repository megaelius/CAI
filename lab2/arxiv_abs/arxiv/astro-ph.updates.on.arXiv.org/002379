We report on the characterization of the Kepler-101 planetary system, thanks to a combined DE-MCMC
analysis of Kepler data and forty radial velocities obtained with the HARPS-N spectrograph. This
system was previously validated by Rowe et al. (2014) and is composed of a hot super-Neptune, Kepler-101b,
and an Earth-sized planet, Kepler-101c. These two planets orbit the slightly evolved and metal-rich
G-type star in 3.49 and 6.03 days, respectively. With mass $M_{\rm p}=51.1_{-4.7}^{+5.1}~M_{\oplus}$,
radius $R_{\rm p}=5.77_{-0.79}^{+0.85}~R_{\oplus}$, and density $\rho_{\rm p}=1.45_{-0.48}^{+0.83}
\rm g\;cm^{-3}$, Kepler-101b is the first fully-characterized super-Neptune, and its density
suggests that heavy elements make up a significant fraction of its interior; more than $60\%$ of
its total mass. Kepler-101c has a radius of $1.25_{-0.17}^{+0.19}~R_{\oplus}$, which implies
the absence of any H/He envelope, but its mass could not be determined due to the relative faintness
of the parent star for highly precise radial-velocity measurements ($K_{\rm p}=13.8$) and the
limited number of radial velocities. The $1~\sigma$ upper limit, $M_{\rm p} < 3.8~M_{\oplus}$,
excludes a pure iron composition with a $68.3\%$ probability. The architecture of the Kepler-101
planetary system - containing a close-in giant planet and an outer Earth-sized planet with a period
ratio slightly larger than the 3:2 resonance - is certainly of interest for planet formation and
evolution scenarios. This system does not follow the trend, seen by Ciardi et al. (2013), that in
the majority of Kepler systems of planet pairs with at least one Neptune-size or larger planet, the
larger planet has the longer period.
