We performed a multi-wavelength study toward the filamentary cloud G47.06+0.26 to investigate
the gas kinematics and star formation. We present the 12CO (J=1-0), 13CO (J=1-0) and C18O (J=1-0)
observations of G47.06+0.26 obtained with the Purple Mountain Observation (PMO) 13.7 m radio telescope
to investigate the detailed kinematics of the filament. The 12CO (J=1-0) and 13CO (J=1-0) emission
of G47.06+0.26 appear to show a filamentary structure. The filament extends about 45 arcmin (58.1
pc) along the east-west direction. The mean width is about 6.8 pc, as traced by the 13CO (J=1-0) emission.
G47.06+0.26 has a linear mass density of about 361.5 Msun/pc. The external pressure (due to neighboring
bubbles and H II regions) may help preventing the filament from dispersing under the effects of turbulence.
From the velocity-field map, we discern a velocity gradient perpendicular to G47.06+0.26. From
the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) catalog, we found nine BGPS sources in G47.06+0.26, that
appear to these sources have sufficient mass to form massive stars. We obtained that the clump formation
efficiency (CFE) is about 18% in the filament. Four infrared bubbles were found to be located in,
and adjacent to, G47.06+0.26. Particularly, infrared bubble N98 shows a cometary structure. CO
molecular gas adjacent to N98 also shows a very intense emission. H II regions associated with infrared
bubbles can inject the energy to surrounding gas. We calculated the kinetic energy, ionization
energy, and thermal energy of two H II regions in G47.06+0.26. From the GLIMPSE I catalog, we selected
some Class I sources with an age of about 100000 yr, which are clustered along the filament. The feedback
from the H II regions may cause the formation of a new generation of stars in filament G47.06+0.26.
