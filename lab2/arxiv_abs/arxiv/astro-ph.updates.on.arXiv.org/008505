Local samples of quiescent galaxies with dynamically measured black hole masses (Mbh) may suffer
from an angular resolution-related selection effect, which could bias the observed scaling relations
between Mbh and host galaxy properties away from the intrinsic relations. In particular, previous
work has shown that the observed Mbh-Mstar (stellar mass) relation is more strongly biased than
the Mbh-sigma (velocity dispersion) relation. Local samples of active galactic nuclei (AGN) do
not suffer from this selection effect, as in these samples Mbh is estimated from megamasers and/or
reverberation mapping-based techniques. With the exception of megamasers, Mbh-estimates in
these AGN samples are proportional to a virial coefficient fvir. Direct modelling of the broad line
region suggests that fvir~3.5. However, this results in a Mbh-Mstar relation for AGN which lies
below and is steeper than the one observed for quiescent black hole samples. A similar though milder
trend is seen for the Mbh-sigma relation. Matching the high-mass end of the Mbh-Mstar and Mbh-sigma
relations observed in quiescent samples requires fvir~15 and fvir~7, respectively. On the other
hand, fvir~3.5 yields Mbh-sigma and Mbh-Mstar relations for AGN which are remarkably consistent
with the expected `intrinsic' correlations for quiescent samples (i.e., once account has been
made of the angular resolution-related selection effect), providing additional evidence that
the sample of local quiescent black holes is biased. We also show that, as is the case for quiescent
black holes, the Mbh-Mstar scaling relation of AGN is driven by velocity dispersion, thus providing
additional key constraints to black hole-galaxy co-evolution models.
