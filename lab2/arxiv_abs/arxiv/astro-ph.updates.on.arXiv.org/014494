Galaxy clusters can play a key role in modern cosmology provided their evolution is properly understood.
However, observed clusters give us only a single timeframe of their dynamical state. Therefore,
finding present observable data of clusters that are well correlated to their assembly history
constitutes an inestimable tool for cosmology. Former studies correlating environmental descriptors
of clusters to their formation history are dominated by halo mass - environment relations. This
paper presents a mass-free correlation between the present neighbor distribution of cluster-size
halos and the latter mass assembly history. From the Big Multidark simulation, we extract two large
samples of random halos with masses ranging from Virgo to Coma cluster sizes. Additionally, to find
the main environmental culprit for the formation history of the Virgo cluster, we compare the Virgo-size
halos to 200 Virgo-like halos extracted from simulations that resemble the local Universe. The
number of neighbors at different cluster-centric distances permits discriminating between clusters
with different mass accretion histories. Similarly to Virgo-like halos, clusters with numerous
neighbors within a distance of about 2 times their virial radius experience a transition at z~1 between
an active period of mass accretion, relative to the mean, and a quiet history. On the contrary, clusters
with few neighbors share an opposite trend: from passive to active assembly histories. Additionally,
clusters with massive companions within about 4 times their virial radius tend to have recent active
merging histories. Therefore, the radial distribution of cluster neighbors provides invaluable
insights into the past history of these objects.
