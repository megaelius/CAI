We present the first suite of cosmological N-body simulations that simultaneously include the
effects of two different and theoretically independent extensions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM
cosmological scenario - namely an $f(R)$ theory of Modified Gravity (MG) and a cosmological background
of massive neutrinos - with the aim to investigate their possible observational degeneracies.
We focus on three basic statistics of the large-scale matter distribution, more specifically the
nonlinear matter power spectrum, the halo mass function, and the halo bias, for which we determine
the deviation with respect to the fiducial $\Lambda$CDM cosmology in the context of both separate
and combined simulations of $f(R)$ MG and massive neutrinos scenarios. Our results show that while
these two extended models separately determine very prominent and potentially detectable features
in all the three statistics, when we allow them to be simultaneously at work these features are strongly
suppressed, resulting in much weaker deviations from the standard model's predictions. In particular,
when an $f(R)$ gravity model with $f_{R0}=-1\times 10^{-4}$ is combined with a total neutrino mass
of $\Sigma _{i}m_{\nu _{i}}=0.4$ eV, the resulting matter power spectrum, halo mass function,
and bias at z=0 are found to be consistent with the standard model's predictions at the 10%, 20%, and
5% accuracy levels, respectively. Therefore, our results imply an intrinsic theoretical limit
to the effective discriminating power of present and future observational data sets with respect
to these widely considered extensions of the standard cosmological scenario in the absence of independent
measurements of the neutrino masses from laboratory experiments, even though the high-redshift
evolution might still allow to partially break the degeneracy [Abridged].
