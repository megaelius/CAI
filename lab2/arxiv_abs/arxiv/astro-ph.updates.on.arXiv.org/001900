We present emission-line flux distributions and ratios for the inner 200pc of the narrow-line region
of the Seyfert2 galaxy NGC1068, using observations obtained with the Gemini Near-infrared Integral
Field Spectrograph (NIFS) in the J, H and K bands at a spatial resolution of 10pc and spectral resolution
of 5300. The molecular gas emission - traced by the K-band H_2 emission lines - outlines an off-centered
circumnuclear ring with a radius of 100pc showing thermal excitation. The ionized gas emission
lines show flux distributions mostly outlining the previously known [OIII]5007 ionization bicone.
But while the flux distributions in the HI and HeII emission lines are very similar to that observed
in [OIII], the flux distribution in the [FeII] emission lines is more extended and broader than a
cone close to the nucleus, showing a "double bowl" or `hourglass" structure". This difference is
attributed to the fact that the [FeII] emission, besides coming from the fully ionized region, comes
also from the more extended partially ionized regions, in gas excited mainly by X-rays from the active
galactic nucleus. A contribution to the [FeII] emission from shocks along the bicone axis to NE and
SW of the nucleus is also supported by the enhancement of the [FeII](1.2570)/[PII](1.1885) and
[FeII](1.2570)/Pabeta emission-line ratios at these locations and is attributed to the interaction
of the radio jet with the NLR. The mass of ionized gas in the inner 200pc of NGC1068 is MHII~2.2E4 M_Sun,
while the mass of the H2 emitting gas is only M_{H2}~29M_Sun. Taking into account the dominant contribution
of the cold molecular gas, we obtain an estimate of the total molecular gas mass of Mcold~2E7 M_Sun.
