In March 2018, Mukherjee (2018) reported the detection by VERITAS of very-high-energy emission
(VHE; > 100 GeV) from 3C 264. This is the sixth, and second most distant, radio galaxy ever detected
in the TeV regime. In this article we present a radio and X-ray analysis of the jet in 3C 264. We determine
the main physical parameters of the parsec-scale flow and explore the implications of the inferred
kinematic structure for radiative models of this gamma-ray emitting jet. The radio data set is comprised
of VLBI observations at 15 GHz from the MOJAVE program, and cover a time period of ~2 years. Through
a segmented wavelet decomposition method we estimate the apparent displacement of individual
plasma features; we then perform a pixel-based analysis of the stacked image to determine the jet
shape. The X-ray data set includes all available observations from the Chandra, XMM, and Swift satellites,
and is used, together with archival data in the other bands, to build the SED. Proper motion is mostly
detected along the edges of the flow, which appears strongly limb-brightened. The apparent speeds
increase as a function of distance from the core up to a maximum of ~$11.5$ c. This constrains the jet
viewing angle to assume relatively small values ($\theta\lesssim10^{\circ}$). In the acceleration
region, extending up to a de-projected distance of ~$4.8\times10^4$ Schwarzschild radii (~$11$
pc), the jet is collimating ($r\propto z^{0.40\pm 0.04}$), as predicted for a magnetically-driven
plasma flow. By assuming that the core region is indeed magnetically dominated ($U_B/U_e>1$),
the SED and the jet power can be well reproduced in the framework of leptonic models, provided that
the high-energy component is associated to a second emitting region. The possibility that this
region is located at the end of the acceleration zone, either in the jet layer or in the spine, is explored
in the modeling.
