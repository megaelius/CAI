Aims. In this work, we present an extended study of the dust environment of a sample of short period
comets and their dynamical history. With this aim, we characterized the dust tails when the comets
are active, and we made a statistical study to determine their dynamical evolution. The targets
selected were 22P/Kopff, 30P/Reinmuth 1, 78P/Gehrels 2, 115P/Maury, 118P/Shoemaker-Levy 4,
123P/West-Hartley, 157P/Tritton, 185/Petriew, and P/2011 W2 (Rinner). Methods. We use two different
observational data: a set of images taken at the Observatorio de Sierra Nevada and the Afrho curves
provided by the amateur astronomical association Cometas-Obs. To model these observations, we
use our Monte Carlo dust tail code. From this analysis, we derive the dust parameters, which best
describe the dust environment: dust loss rates, ejection velocities, and size distribution of
particles. On the other hand, we use a numerical integrator to study the dynamical history of the
comets, which allows us to determine with a 90% of confidence level the time spent by these objects
in the region of Jupiter Family Comets. Results. From the Monte Carlo dust tail code, we derived three
categories attending to the amount of dust emitted: Weakly active (115P, 157P, and Rinner), moderately
active (30P, 123P, and 185P), and highly active (22P, 78P, and 118P). The dynamical studies showed
that the comets of this sample are young in the Jupiter Family region, where the youngest ones are
22P (100 yr), 78P (500 yr), and 118P (600 yr). The study points to a certain correlation between comet
activity and time spent in the Jupiter Family region, although this trend is not always fulfilled.
The largest particle sizes are not tightly constrained, so that the total dust mass derived should
be regarded as lower limits.}
