Recent analysis of scientific data from Cassini and earth-based observations gave evidence for
a global ocean under a surrounding solid ice shell on Saturn's moon Enceladus. Images of Enceladus'
South Pole showed several fissures in the ice shell with plumes constantly exhausting frozen water
particles, building up the E-Ring, one of the outer rings of Saturn. In this southern region of Enceladus,
the ice shell is considered to be as thin as 2 km, about an order of magnitude thinner than on the rest
of the moon. Under the ice shell, there is a global ocean consisting of liquid water. Scientists are
discussing different approaches the possibilities of taking samples of water, i.e. by melting
through the ice using a melting probe. FH Aachen UAS developed a prototype of maneuverable melting
probe which can navigate through the ice that has already been tested successfully in a terrestrial
environment. This means no atmosphere and or ambient pressure, low ice temperatures of around 100
to 150 K (near the South Pole) and a very low gravity of 0.114 m/s$^2$ or 1100 {\mu}g. Two of these influencing
measures are about to be investigated at FH Aachen UAS in 2017, low ice temperature and low ambient
pressure below the triple point of water. Low gravity cannot be easily simulated inside a large experiment
chamber, though. Numerical simulations of the melting process at RWTH Aachen however are showing
a gravity dependence of melting behavior. Considering this aspect, VIPER provides a link between
large-scale experimental simulations at FH Aachen UAS and numerical simulations at RWTH Aachen.
To analyze the melting process, about 90 seconds of experiment time in reduced gravity and low ambient
pressure is provided by the REXUS rocket.
