We have undertaken the largest survey for outflows within the Galactic Plane using simultaneously
observed 13CO and C18O data. 325 out of a total of 919 ATLASGAL clumps have data suitable to identify
outflows, and 225 (69+-3%) of them show high velocity outflows. The clumps with detected outflows
show significantly higher clump masses (M_{clump}), bolometric luminosities (L_{bol}), luminosity-to-mass
ratios (L_{bol}/M_{clump}) and peak H_2 column densities (N_{H_2}) compared to those without
outflows. Outflow activity has been detected within the youngest quiescent clump (i.e.,70um weak)
in this sample and we find that the outflow detection rate increases with M_{clump},L_{bol},L_{bol}/M_{clump}
and N_{H_2},approaching 90% in some cases(uchii regions=93+-3%;masers=86+-4%;hchii regions=100%).
This high detection rate suggests that outflows are ubiquitous phenomena of massive star formation.
The mean outflow mass entrainment rate implies a mean accretion rate of ~10^{-4}M_\odot\,yr^{-1},
in full agreement with the accretion rate predicted by theoretical models of massive star formation.
Outflow properties are tightly correlated with M_{clump},L_{bol} and L_{bol}/M_{clump},and
show the strongest relation with the bolometric clump luminosity. This suggests that outflows
might be driven by the most massive and luminous source within the clump. The correlations are similar
for both low-mass and high-mass outflows over 7 orders of magnitude, indicating that they may share
a similar outflow mechanism. Outflow energy is comparable to the turbulent energy within the clump,
however, we find no evidence that outflows increase the level of clump turbulence as the clumps evolve.
This implies that the origin of turbulence within clumps is fixed before the onset of star formation.
