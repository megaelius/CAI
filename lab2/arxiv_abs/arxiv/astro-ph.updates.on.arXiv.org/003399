Ab initio grids of time dependent chemical models, varying in gas density, temperature, cosmic
ray ionization rate, and radiation field, are used as input to RADEX calculations. Tables of abundances,
column densities, theoretical line intensities, and line ratios for some of the most used dense
gas tracers are provided. The degree of correlation as well as degeneracy inherent in molecular
ratios is discussed. Comparisons of the theoretical intensities with example observations are
also provided. We find that, within the parameters space explored, chemical abundances can be constrained
by a well defined set of gas density-gas temperature-cosmic ray ionization rate for the species
we investigate here. However, line intensities, as well as, more importantly, line ratios, from
different chemical models can be very similar leading to a clear degeneracy. We also find that the
gas subjected to a galactic cosmic ray ionization rate will not necessarily have reached steady
state by 1 Myr. The species most affected by time dependency effects are HCN and CS, both high density
tracers. We use our method to fit an example set of data from two galaxies. We find that (i) molecular
line ratios can be easily matched even with erroneous individual line intensities; (ii) no set of
species can be matched by a one-component ISM; (iii) a species may be a good tracer of an energetic
process but only under specific density and temperature conditions. We show that by taking into
consideration the chemistry behind each species and the individual line intensities, many degeneracies
that arise by just using molecular line ratios can be avoided. Finally we show that using a species
or a ratio as a tracer of an individual energetic process (e.g. cosmic rays, UV) ought to be done with
caution.
