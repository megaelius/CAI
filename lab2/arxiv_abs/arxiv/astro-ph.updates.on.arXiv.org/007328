Context. Stars can maintain their observable magnetic activity from the PMS to the tip of the red
giant branch. However, the number of known active giants is much lower than active stars on the main
sequence since on the giant branch the stars spend only about 10% of their main sequence lifetime.
Due to their rapid evolution it is difficult to estimate the stellar parameters of giant stars. A
possibility for obtaining more reliable stellar parameters of an active giant arises when it is
a member of an eclipsing binary system. Aims. We have discovered EPIC 211759736, an active spotted
giant star in an eclipsing binary system during the Kepler K2 Campaign 5. The eclipsing nature allows
us to much better constrain the stellar parameters than in most cases of active giant stars. Method.
We have combined the K2 data with archival HATNet and DASCH photometry, new spectroscopic radial
velocity measurements, and a set of follow-up ground-based BVRI photometric observations, to
find the binary system parameters as well as robust spot models for the giant at two different epochs.
Results. We determined the physical parameters of both stellar components and provide a description
of the rotational and long-term activity of the primary component. The temperatures and luminosities
of both components were examined in the context of the HR diagram. We find that both the primary and
the secondary components deviate from the evolutionary tracks corresponding to their masses in
the sense that the stars appear in the diagram at lower masses than their true masses. Conclusions.
We further evaluate the proposition that active giants have masses that are found to be generally
higher by traditional methods than are indicated by stellar evolution tracks in the HR diagram.
A possible reason for this discrepancy could be a strong magnetic field, since we see greater differences
in more active stars.
