We present the first results of a high-resolution Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) imaging survey
of luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs) in the Great Observatories All-Sky
LIRG Survey (GOALS). From the full sample of 68 galaxies, we have selected 25 LIRGs that show resolved
extended emission at sufficient sensitivity to image individual regions of star-formation activity
beyond the nucleus.~With wideband radio continuum observations, which sample the frequency range
from $3-33$ GHz, we have made extinction-free measurements of the luminosities and spectral indicies
for a total of 48 individual star-forming regions identified as having de-projected galactocentric
radii ($r_{G}$) that lie outside the 13.2$\mu$m core of the galaxy.~The median $3-33$ GHz spectral
index and 33 GHz thermal fraction measured for these "extranuclear" regions is $-0.51 \pm 0.13$
and $65 \pm 11\%$ respectively.~These values are consistent with measurements made on matched
spatial scales in normal star-forming galaxies, and suggests that these regions are more heavily-dominated
by thermal free-free emission relative to the centers of local ULIRGs.~Further, we find that the
median star-formation rate derived for these regions is $\sim 1 M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, and when
we place them on the sub-galactic star-forming main sequence of galaxies (SFMS), we find they are
offset from their host galaxies' globally-averaged specific star-formation rates (sSFRs).~We
conclude that while nuclear starburst activity drives LIRGs above the SFMS, extranuclear star-formation
still proceeds in a more extreme fashion relative to what is seen in local spiral galaxies.
