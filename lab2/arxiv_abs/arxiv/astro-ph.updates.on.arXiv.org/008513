Recent imaging observations with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograp (IRIS) have revealed
prevalent intermittent jets with apparent speeds of 80--250 km~s$^{-1}$ from the network lanes
in the solar transition region (TR). On the other hand, spectroscopic observations of the TR lines
have revealed the frequent presence of highly non-Gaussian line profiles with enhanced emission
at the line wings, often referred as explosive events (EEs). Using simultaneous imaging and spectroscopic
observations from IRIS, we investigate the relationship between EEs and network jets. We first
identify EEs from the Si~{\sc{iv}}~1393.755 {\AA} line profiles in our observations, then examine
related features in the 1330 {\AA} slit-jaw images. Our analysis suggests that EEs with double peaks
or enhancements in both wings appear to be located at either the footpoints of network jets, or transient
compact brightenings. These EEs are most likely produced by magnetic reconnection. We also find
that EEs with enhancements only at the blue wing are mainly located on network jets, away from the
footpoints. These EEs clearly result from the superposition of the high-speed network jets on the
TR background. In addition, EEs showing enhancement only at the red wing of the line are often located
around the jet footpoints, possibly caused by the superposition of reconnection downflows on the
background emission. Moreover, we find some network jets that are not associated with any detectable
EEs. Our analysis suggests that some EEs are related to the birth or propagation of network jets,
and that others are not connected to network jets.
