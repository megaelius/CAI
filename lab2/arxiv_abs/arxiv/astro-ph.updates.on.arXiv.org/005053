Comet C/2017 K2 PANSTARRS drew attention to its activity already at a time of its discovery in May
2017 when it was about 16 au from the Sun. In order to answer the question whether C/2017 K2 is a dynamically
old or new comet it is necessary to obtain its precise osculating orbit, its original orbit, and propagate
its motion backwards in time to the previous perihelion. We study a dynamical evolution of C/2017
K2 to the previous perihelion (backward calculations for about 3-4 Myr) as well as to the future (forward
calculations for about 0.033 Myr) using the swarm of virtual comets (VCs) constructed from a nominal
osculating orbit of this comet which we determined here using all positional measurements available
at the moment. Outside the planetary system both Galactic and stellar perturbations were taken
into account. We derived that C/2017 K2 is a dynamically old Oort spike comet ($1/a_{\rm prev}=(48.7\pm
7.9)\times 10^{-6}$ au$^{-1}$) with the previous perihelion distance below 10 au for 97 per cent
of VCs (nominal $q_{\rm prev}=3.77$ au). According to the present data this comet will be perturbed
into a more tightly bound orbit after passing the planetary zone ($1/a_{\rm next}=(1140.2\pm 8.0)\times
10^{-6}$ au$^{-1}$, $q_{\rm next}=1.79334\pm 0.00006$ au). C/2017 K2 has already visited our
planetary zone during its previous perihelion passage. Thus, it is almost certainly a dynamically
old Oort spike comet. The future orbital solution of this comet is formally very precise, however,
it is much less definitive since the presented analysis is based on pre-perihelion data taken at
very large heliocentric distances (23.7-14.6 au from the Sun), and this comet can experience a significant
non-gravitational perturbations during the upcoming perihelion passage in 2022.
