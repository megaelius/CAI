Using mock spectra based on Vazdekis/MILES library fitted within the wavelength region 3600-7350\AA,
we analyze the bias and scatter on the resulting physical parameters induced by the choice of fitting
algorithms and observational uncertainties, but avoid effects of those model uncertainties.
We consider two full-spectrum fitting codes: pPXF and STARLIGHT, in fitting for stellar population
age, metallicity, mass-to-light ratio, and dust extinction. With pPXF we find that both the bias
in the population parameters and the scatter in the recovered logarithmic values follows the expected
trend. The bias increases for younger ages and systematically makes recovered ages older, $M_*/L_r$
larger and metallicities lower than the true values. For reference, at S/N=30, and for the worst
case ($t=10^8$yr), the bias is 0.06 dex in $M_*/L_r$, 0.03 dex in both age and [M/H]. There is no significant
dependence on either E(B-V) or the shape of the error spectrum. Moreover, the results are consistent
for both our 1-SSP and 2-SSP tests. With the STARLIGHT algorithm, we find trends similar to pPXF,
when the input E(B-V)<0.2 mag. However, with larger input E(B-V), the biases of the output parameter
do not converge to zero even at the highest S/N and are strongly affected by the shape of the error spectra.
This effect is particularly dramatic for youngest age, for which all population parameters can
be strongly different from the input values, with significantly underestimated dust extinction
and [M/H], and larger ages and $M_*/L_r$. Results degrade when moving from our 1-SSP to the 2-SSP
tests. The STARLIGHT convergence to the true values can be improved by increasing Markov Chains
and annealing loops to the "slow mode". For the same input spectrum, pPXF is about two order of magnitudes
faster than STARLIGHT's "default mode" and about three order of magnitude faster than STARLIGHT's
"slow mode".
