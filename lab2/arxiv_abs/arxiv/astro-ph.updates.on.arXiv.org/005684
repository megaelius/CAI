We report on a search for ultraluminous Lyman alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs) at z=6.6 using the NB921
filter on Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru telescope. We searched a 30 degree squared area around
the North Ecliptic Pole, which we observed in broadband g', r', i', z', and y' and narrowband NB816
and NB921, for sources with NB921 < 23.5 and z' - NB921 > 1.3. This corresponds to a selection of log
L(Ly-alpha) > 43.5 erg/s. We followed up seven candidate LAEs (out of thirteen) with the Keck DEIMOS
spectrograph and confirmed five z=6.6 LAEs, one z=6.6 AGN with a broad Ly-alpha line and a strong
red continuum, and one low-redshift ([OIII]5007) galaxy. The five ultraluminous LAEs have wider
line profiles than lower luminosity LAEs, and one source, NEPLA4, has a complex line profile similar
to that of COLA1. In combination with previous results, we show that the line profiles of the z=6.6
ultraluminous LAEs are systematically different than those of lower luminosity LAEs at this redshift.
This result suggests that ultraluminous LAEs generate highly ionized regions of the intergalactic
medium in their vicinity that allow the full Lyman alpha profile of the galaxy---including any blue
wings---to be visible. If this interpretation is correct, then ultraluminous LAEs offer a unique
opportunity to determine the properties of the ionized zones around them, which will help in understanding
the ionization of the z ~ 7 intergalactic medium. A simple calculation gives a very rough estimate
of 0.015 for the escape fraction of ionizing photons, but more sophisticated calculations are needed
to fully characterize the uncertainties.
