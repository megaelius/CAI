We present the large statistics of the galaxy effective radius in the rest-frame far-infrared (FIR)
wavelength Re(FIR) obtained from 1627 deep ALMA 1-mm band maps that become public by 2017 July. Our
ALMA sample consists of 1034 sources at z=0-6 that typically have the star-formation rate of ~100-1000
M$_{\odot}$/yr and the stellar mass of ~10$^{10}$-10$^{11.5}$ M$_{\odot}$. We homogeneously
derive Re(FIR) and FIR luminosity L_FIR of our ALMA sources via the same uv-visibility method with
the exponential disk fitting, carefully evaluating the selection and measurement incompletenesses
by realistic Monte-Carlo simulations. We find that there is a positive correlation between Re(FIR)
and L_FIR at the >99% significance level. The best-fit power-law function, Re(FIR) $\propto$ L_FIR$^{\alpha}$,
provides $\alpha=0.28+/-0.07$, and shows that the average Re(FIR) at a fixed L_FIR decreases toward
high redshifts. The best-fit $\alpha$ and the redshift evolution of Re(FIR) are similar to those
of the galaxy effective radius in the rest-frame UV (optical) wavelength Re(UV) (Re(Opt.)) revealed
by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) studies. We identify that our ALMA sources have significant trends
of Re(FIR) <~ Re(UV) and Re(Opt.), suggesting that dusty starbursts take place in a compact region.
Moreover, Re(FIR) of our ALMA sources is comparable to Re(Opt.) of quiescent galaxies at z~1-3 as
a function of stellar mass, supporting the evolutionary connection between these two galaxy populations.
We also investigate rest-frame UV and optical morphologies of our ALMA sources with deep HST images,
and find that ~30-40% of our ALMA sources are classified as major mergers. This indicates that dusty
starbursts are triggered not only by the major mergers but also the other mechanism(s).
