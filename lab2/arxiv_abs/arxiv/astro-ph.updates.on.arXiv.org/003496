We obtained ALMA spectroscopy and imaging to investigate the origin of the unexpected sub-mm emission
toward the most distant quiescent galaxy known to date, ZF-COSMOS-20115 at z=3.717. We show here
that this sub-mm emission is produced by another massive, compact and extremely obscured galaxy,
located only 3.4 kpc away from the quiescent galaxy. We dub the quiescent and dusty galaxies Jekyll
and Hyde, respectively. No dust emission is detected at the location of the quiescent galaxy, implying
SFR < 13 Msun/yr, which is the most stringent upper limit ever obtained for a quiescent galaxy at these
redshifts. The two sources are confirmed to lie at the same redshift thanks to the detection of [CII]158
in Hyde, which provides one the few robust redshifts for an "H-dropout" galaxy. The line has a rotating-disk
velocity profile blueshifted compared to Jekyll by 549+/-60 km/s, demonstrating that it is produced
by another galaxy. Careful de-blending of the Spitzer imaging confirms the existence of Hyde, and
its non-detection with Hubble requires extreme attenuation by dust. Modeling the photometry of
both galaxies shows that Jekyll has fully quenched >200 Myr prior to observation and still presents
a challenge for models, while Hyde only harbors moderate star-formation (SFR<120 Msun/yr) and
is located at least a factor of two below the z~4 main sequence. Hyde could also have stopped forming
stars <200 Myr before being observed, which would be consistent with its compactness comparable
to that of z~4 quiescent galaxies and its low [CII]/FIR ratio. Finally, we show that Hyde hosts a dense
reservoir of gas comparable to that of extreme starbursts, suggesting that its SFR was reduced without
expelling the gas outside of the galaxy. We argue that Jekyll and Hyde can be seen as two stages of quenching,
and provide a unique laboratory to study this poorly understood phenomenon. [abridged]
