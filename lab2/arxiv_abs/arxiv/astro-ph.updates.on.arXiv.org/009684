We investigate the prevalence, properties, and kinematics of extraplanar diffuse ionized gas
(eDIG) in a sample of 25 edge-on galaxies selected from the CALIFA survey. We measure ionized gas
scale heights from ${\rm H\alpha}$ and find that 90% have measurable scale heights with a median
of $0.8^{+0.7}_{-0.4}$ kpc. From the ${\rm H\alpha}$ kinematics, we find that 60% of galaxies show
a decrease in the rotation velocity as a function of height above the midplane. This lag is characteristic
of eDIG, and we measure a median lag of 21 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ which is comparable to lags measured
in the literature. We also investigate variations in the lag with radius. $\rm H{\small I}$ lags
have been reported to systematically decrease with galactocentric radius. We find both increasing
and decreasing ionized gas lags with radius, as well as a large number of galaxies consistent with
no radial lag variation, and investigate these results in the context of internal and external origins
for the lagging ionized gas. We confirm that the ${\rm [S{\small II}]}$/${\rm H\alpha}$ and ${\rm
[N{\small II}]}$/${\rm H\alpha}$ line ratios increase with height above the midplane as is characteristic
of eDIG. The ionization of the eDIG is dominated by star-forming complexes (leaky ${\rm H{\small
II}}$ regions). We conclude that the lagging ionized gas is turbulent ejected gas likely resulting
from star formation activity in the disk as opposed to gas in the stellar thick disk or bulge. This
is further evidence for the eDIG being a product of stellar feedback and for the pervasiveness of
this WIM-like phase in many local star-forming galaxies.
