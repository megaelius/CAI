Using the NANTEN2 Observatory, we carried out a molecular line study of high-mass star forming regions
with reflection nebulae, NGC 2068 and NGC 2071, in Orion in the 13CO(J=2-1) transition. The 13CO
distribution shows that there are two velocity components at 9.0 and 10.5 km/s . The blue-shifted
component is in the northeast associated with NGC 2071, whereas the red-shifted component is in
the southwest associated with NGC 2068. The total intensity distribution of the two clouds shows
a gap of ~1 pc, suggesting that they are detached at present. A detailed spatial comparison indicates
that the two show complementary distributions. The blue-shifted component lies toward an intensity
depression to the northwest of the red-shifted component, where we find that a displacement of 0.8
pc makes the two clouds fit well with each other. Furthermore, a new simulation of non-frontal collisions
shows that observations from 60 degrees off the collisional axis agreed well with the velocity structure
in this region. On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that the two components collided with
each other at a projected relative velocity 3.0 km/s estimated to be 0.3 Myr for an assumed axis of
the relative motion 60 degrees off the line of sight. We assume that the two most massive early B-type
stars in the cloud, illuminating stars of the two reflection nebulae, were formed by collisional
triggering at the interfaces between the two clouds. Given the other young high-mass star forming
regions, namely, M42, M43, and NGC 2024 (Fukui et al. 2018b; Ohama et al. 2017a), it seems possible
that collisional triggering has been independently working to form O-type and early B-type stars
in Orion in the last Myr over a projected distance of ~80 pc.
