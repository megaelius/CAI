Radio interferometric imaging aims to estimate an unknown sky intensity image from degraded observations,
acquired through an antenna array. In the theoretical case of a perfectly calibrated array, it has
been shown that solving the corresponding imaging problem by iterative algorithms based on convex
optimization and compressive sensing theory can be competitive with classical algorithms such
as CLEAN. However, in practice, antenna-based gains are unknown and have to be calibrated. Future
radio telescopes, such as the SKA, aim at improving imaging resolution and sensitivity by orders
of magnitude. At this precision level, the direction-dependency of the gains must be accounted
for, and radio interferometric imaging can be understood as a blind deconvolution problem. In this
context, the underlying minimization problem is non-convex, and adapted techniques have to be
designed. In this work, leveraging recent developments in non-convex optimization, we propose
the first joint calibration and imaging method in radio interferometry, with proven convergence
guarantees. Our approach, based on a block-coordinate forward-backward algorithm, jointly accounts
for visibilities and suitable priors on both the image and the direction-dependent effects (DDEs).
As demonstrated in recent works, sparsity remains the prior of choice for the image, while DDEs are
modelled as smooth functions of the sky, i.e. spatially band-limited. Finally, we show through
simulations the efficiency of our method, for the reconstruction of both images of point sources
and complex extended sources. MATLAB code is available on GitHub.
