To understand the role that planet formation history has on the observable atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen
ratio (C/O) we have produced a population of astrochemically evolving protoplanetary disks. Based
on the parameters used in a pre-computed population of growing planets their combination allows
us to trace the molecular abundances of the gas that is being collected into planetary atmospheres.
We include atmospheric pollution of incoming (icy) planetesimals as well as the effect of refractory
carbon erosion noted to exist in our own solar system. We find that the carbon and oxygen content of
Neptune-mass planets are determined primarily through solid accretion and result in more oxygen-rich
(by roughly two orders of magnitude) atmospheres than Hot-Jupiters, whose C/O are primarily determined
by gas accretion. Generally we find a `main-sequence' between the fraction of planetary mass accreted
through solid accretion and the resulting atmospheric C/O - with planets of higher solid accretion
fraction having lower C/O. Hot-Jupiters whose atmospheres have been chemically characterized
agree well with our population of planets, and our results suggest that Hot Jupiter formation typically
begins near the water ice line. Lower mass hot-Neptunes are observed to be much more carbon-rich
(with 0.33 $\lesssim$ C/O $\lesssim$ 1) than is found in our models (C/O $\sim 10^{-2}$), and suggest
that some form of chemical processing may affect their observed C/O over the few Gyrs between formation
and observation. Our population reproduces the general mass-metallicity trend of the solar system
and qualitatively reproduces the C/O-metallicity anti-correlation that has been inferred for
the population of characterized exoplanetary atmospheres.
