Effective stellar feedback is used in models of galaxy formation to regulate star formation and
drive realistic galaxy evolution. Models typically include energy injection from supernovae
as the dominant form of stellar feedback, often in some form of sub-grid recipe. However, it has been
recently suggested that pre-SN feedback, from either stellar winds or stellar radiation, is necessary
in high-resolution simulations of galaxy evolution to properly regulate star formation and properties
of the interstellar medium (ISM). Following stellar winds and ionizing radiation is computationally
challenging, so many prescriptions model this feedback approximately, accounting for the local
destruction of dense gas clouds around newly formed stars in lieu of a full radiative transfer calculation.
In this work we use high resolution simulations (1.8~pc) of an isolated dwarf galaxy with detailed
stellar feedback tracked on a star-by-star basis. By following stellar ionizing radiation with
an adaptive ray-tracing radiative transfer method, we test its importance in regulating star formation
and driving outflows in this galaxy. We find that including ionizing radiation reduces the star
formation rate by over a factor of 5, and is necessary in creating the ISM conditions needed for supernovae
to drive significant outflows. In addition, we find that a localized approximation for radiation
feedback is sufficient to regulate the star formation rate on short timescales, but is unable to
drive the same outflows as in our fiducial model. Short and long range radiation effects are both
important in driving the evolution of our modeled galaxy.
