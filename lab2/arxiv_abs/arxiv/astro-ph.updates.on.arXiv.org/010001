In this paper we undertake a study of the 21 square degree SMOG field, a Spitzer cryogenic mission
Legacy program to map a region of the outer Milky Way towards the Perseus and Outer spiral arms with
the IRAC and MIPS instruments. We identify 4648 YSOs across the field. Using the DBSCAN method we
identify 68 clusters or aggregations of YSOs in the region, having 8 or more members. We identify
1197 class Is, 2632 class IIs, 819 class IIIs, of which 45 are candidate transition disk objects,
utilizing the MIPS 24 photometry. The ratio of YSOs identified as members of clusters was 2872/4648,
or 62%. The ratios of class I to class II YSOs in the clusters are broadly consistent with those found
in the inner galactic and nearby Gould's Belt young star formation regions. The clustering properties
indicate that the protostars may be more tightly bound to their natal sites than the class IIs, and
the class IIIs are generally widely distributed. We further perform an analysis of the WISE data
of the SMOG field to determine how the lower resolution and sensitivity of WISE affects the identification
of YSOs as compared to Spitzer: we identify 931 YSOs using combined WISE and 2MASS photometry, 931/4648
or 20% of the total number identified with Spitzer. Performing the same clustering analysis finds
31 clusters which reliably trace the larger associations identified with the Spitzer data. Twelve
of the clusters identified have previously measured distances from the WISE HII survey. SEDFitter
modeling of these YSOs is reported, leading to an estimation of the IMF in the aggregate of these clusters
which approximates that found in the inner galaxy, implying that the processes behind stellar mass
distribution during star formation are not widely affected by the lower density and metallicity
of the outer galaxy.
