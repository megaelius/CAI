Aiming to characterise the properties of the molecular gas in the ultraluminous infrared galaxy
Mrk273 and its outflow, we used the NOEMA interferometer to image the dense gas molecular tracers
HCN, HCO+, HNC, HOC+ and HC3N at 86GHz and 256GHz with angular resolutions of 4.9x4.5 arcsec (3.7x3.4
kpc) and 0.61x0.55 arcsec (460x420 pc). We also modelled the flux of several H2O lines observed with
Herschel using a radiative transfer code that includes excitation by collisions as well as by far-infrared
photons. The disk of the Mrk273 north nucleus has two components with decoupled kinematics. The
gas in the outer parts (1.5 kpc) rotates with a south-east to north-west direction, while in the inner
disk (300 pc) follows a north-east to south-west rotation. The central 300 pc, which hosts a compact
starburst region, is filled with dense and warm gas, contains a dynamical mass of (4-5)x10^9M_sun,
a luminosity of L'_HCN=(3-4)x10^8 K km/s pc^2, and a dust temperature of 55 K. At the very centre,
a compact core with R~50 pc has a luminosity of L_IR=4x10^11L_sun (30% of the total infrared luminosity),
and a dust temperature of 95 K. The core is expanding at low velocities ~50-100 km/s, probably affected
by the outflowing gas. We detect the blue-shifted component of the outflow, while the red-shifted
counterpart remains undetected in our data. Its cold and dense phase reaches fast velocities up
to ~1000 km/s, while the warm outflowing gas has more moderate maximum velocities of ~600 km/s. The
outflow is detected as far as 460 pc from the centre in the northern direction, and has a mass of dense
gas <8x10^8M_sun. The difference between the position angles of the inner disk (~70 degree) and
the outflow (~10 degree) indicates that the outflow is likely powered by the AGN, and not by the starburst.
Regarding the chemistry, we measure an extremely low HCO+/HOC+ ratio of 10+-5 in the inner disk of
Mrk273.
