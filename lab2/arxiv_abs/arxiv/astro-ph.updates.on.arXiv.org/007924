The determination of stellar effective temperature ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}$) in F, G, and K stars using
H$\alpha$ profile fitting is a quite remarkable and powerful tool, because it practically does
not depend on other atmospheric parameters and reddening. Nevertheless, this technique is not
frequently used because of the complex procedure to recover the profile of broad lines in echelle
spectra. As a consequence, tests performed on different models have sometimes provided ambiguous
results. We have developed a normalization method for recovering undistorted H$\alpha$ profiles
and we have first applied it to spectra acquired with the single order instrument at do Pico dos Dias
Observatory to avoid the problem of blaze correction. The continuum location is optimized using
an iterative procedure, where the identification of minute telluric features is performed. A set
of spectra was acquired with the MUSICOS echelle spectrograph ($R = 40~000$) to independently validate
the normalization method. The accuracy of the method and of the 1D + LTE model is determined using
coud\'{e}/HARPS/MUSICOS spectra of the Sun and a sample of 10 Gaia Benchmark Stars with effective
temperature determined from interferometric measurements. We find that the most used solar atlases
cannot be used as templates for H$\alpha$ temperature diagnostics without renormalization. The
comparison with the Sun shows that $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ derived with H$\alpha$ profiles from 1D
+ LTE models underestimate the solar effective temperature by 28 K. Interferometry and Infrared
Flux Method show a dependency on metallicity according to the relation $T_{\mathrm{eff}} = T_{\mathrm{eff}}^{H\alpha}$
$-159$[Fe/H] + 28 K within the metallicity range $-0.7$ to $+0.45$ dex. We find 3D models largely
improve the agreement with the interferometric and Infrared Flux Method measurements.
