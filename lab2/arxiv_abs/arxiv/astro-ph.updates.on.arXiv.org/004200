We introduce the MOdelling Star cluster population Assembly In Cosmological Simulations within
EAGLE (E-MOSAICS) project. E-MOSAICS incorporates models describing the formation, evolution
and disruption of star clusters into the EAGLE galaxy formation simulations, enabling the examination
of the co-evolution of star clusters and their host galaxies in a fully cosmological context. A fraction
of the star formation rate of dense gas is assumed to yield a cluster population; this fraction, and
the population's initial properties, are governed by the physical properties of the natal gas.
The subsequent evolution and disruption of the entire cluster population is followed accounting
for two-body relaxation, stellar evolution, and gravitational shocks induced by the local tidal
field. This introductory paper presents a detailed description of the model and initial results
from a suite of 10 simulations of $\sim L^\star$ galaxies with disc-like morphologies at $z=0$.
The simulations broadly reproduce key observed characteristics of young star clusters and globular
clusters (GCs), without invoking separate formation mechanisms for each population. The simulated
GCs are the surviving population of massive clusters formed at early epochs ($z\gtrsim1-2$), when
the characteristic pressures and surface densities of star-forming gas were significantly higher
than observed in local galaxies. We examine the influence of the star formation and assembly histories
of galaxies on their cluster populations, finding that (at similar present-day mass) earlier-forming
galaxies foster a more massive and disruption-resilient cluster population, while galaxies with
late mergers are capable of forming massive clusters even at late cosmic epochs. (Abridged)
