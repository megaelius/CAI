The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument is a major component of NASA's Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO) spacecraft. Since beginning normal science operations on 1 May 2010, HMI has
operated with remarkable continuity, e.g. during the more than five years of the SDO prime mission
that ended 30 September 2015, HMI collected 98.4% of all possible 45-second velocity maps; minimizing
gaps in these full-disk Dopplergrams is crucial for helioseismology. HMI velocity, intensity,
and magnetic-field measurements are used in numerous investigations, so understanding the quality
of the data is important. We describe the calibration measurements used to track HMI performance
and detail trends in important instrument parameters during the mission. Regular calibration
sequences provide information used to improve and update the HMI data calibration. The set-point
temperature of the instrument front window and optical bench is adjusted regularly to maintain
instrument focus, and changes in the temperature-control scheme have been made to improve stability
in the observable quantities. The exposure time has been changed to compensate for a 15% decrease
in instrument throughput. Measurements of the performance of the shutter and tuning mechanisms
show that they are aging as expected and continue to perform according to specification. Parameters
of the tunable-optical-filter elements are regularly adjusted to account for drifts in the central
wavelength. Frequent measurements of changing CCD-camera characteristics, such as gain and flat
field, are used to calibrate the observations. Infrequent expected events, such as eclipses, transits,
and spacecraft off-points, interrupt regular instrument operations and provide the opportunity
to perform additional calibration. Onboard instrument anomalies are rare and seem to occur quite
uniformly in time. The instrument continues to perform very well.
