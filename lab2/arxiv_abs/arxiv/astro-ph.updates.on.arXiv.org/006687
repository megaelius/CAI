Atmospheric characterization of directly imaged planets has thus far been limited to ground-based
observations of young, self-luminous, Jovian planets. Near-term space- and ground- based facilities
like \emph{WFIRST} and ELTs will be able to directly image mature Jovian planets in reflected light,
a critical step in support of future facilities that aim to directly image terrestrial planets in
reflected light (e.g. HabEx, LUVOIR). These future facilities are considering the use of photometry
to classify planets. Here, we investigate the intricacies of using colors to classify gas-giant
planets by analyzing a grid of 9,120 theoretical reflected light spectra spread across different
metallicities, pressure-temperature profiles, cloud properties, and phase angles. We determine
how correlated these planet parameters are with the colors in the \emph{WFIRST} photometric bins
and other photometric bins proposed in the literature. Then we outline under what conditions giant
planet populations can be classified using several supervised multivariate classification algorithms.
We find that giant planets imaged in reflected light can be classified by metallicity with an accuracy
of $>$90\% if they are \emph{a prior} known to not have significant cloud coverage in the visible
part of the atmosphere, and at least 3 filter observations are available. If the presence of clouds
is not known \emph{a priori}, directly imaged planets can be more accurately classified by their
cloud properties, as oppposed to metallicity or temperature. Furthermore, we are able to distinguish
between cloudy and cloud-free populations with $>$90\% accuracy with 3 filter observations. Our
statistical pipeline is available on GitHub and can be extended to optimize science yield of future
mission concepts.
