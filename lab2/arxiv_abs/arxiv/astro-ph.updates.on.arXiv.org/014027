An accurate theoretical template of the redshift-space galaxy power spectrum, if applicable out
to nonlinear scales, enables us to extract more stringent and robust constraints on cosmological
parameters from the measured galaxy clustering. In this work we develop a simulation-based template,
so-called emulator, for the redshift-space power spectrum of dark matter halos. Using the redshift-space
halo power spectra measured from the Dark Quest $N$-body simulation suite that covers 101 flat-geometry
$w$CDM cosmologies around the Planck $\Lambda$CDM model, we feed these data into a feed-forward
neural network to build the fast and accurate emulation of the power spectrum from the linear to nonlinear
scales up to $k \simeq 0.6 \, h \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Our emulator achieves about 1 and 5% fractional
accuracies in predicting the monopole and quadrupole moments of the power spectrum, respectively,
for halos of $\sim 10^{13}h^{-1}M_\odot$ that correspond to host halos of the SDSS LOWZ- and CMASS-like
galaxies, where the achieved accuracies are sufficient compared to the statistical errors of SDSS
volume. The validation and performance of the emulator are given by the comparison of the emulator
predictions with the power spectra directly measured from the simulations for validation sets
that are not used in the training. We demonstrate that the emulator outputs can be used to make model
predictions for the redshift-space power spectrum of galaxies by employing user-fed models for
the halo-galaxy connection, such as the halo occupation distribution. The emulator allows us to
easily incorporate the Finger-of-God effect due to the virial motions of galaxies and the Alcock--Paczy\'{n}ski
distortions. Our code can compute the redshift-space galaxy power spectrum in a CPU subseconds,
and is ready to perform the emulator-based cosmological analysis for the exiting and upcoming galaxy
redshift surveys.
