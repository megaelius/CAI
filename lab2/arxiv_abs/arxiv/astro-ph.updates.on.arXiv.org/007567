Despite extensive efforts, only two quasars have been found at $z>7$ to date due to a combination
of low spatial density and high contamination from more ubiquitous Galactic cool dwarfs in quasar
selection. This limits our current knowledge of the super-massive black hole (SMBH) growth mechanism
and reionization history. In this letter, we report the discovery of a luminous quasar at $z=7.021$,
DELS J003836.10$-$152723.6 (hereafter J0038$-$1527), selected using photometric data from
DESI Legacy imaging Survey (DELS), Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) imaging Survey, as well as Wide-field Infrared
Survey Explore ($WISE$) mid-infrared all-sky survey. With an absolute magnitude of $M_{1450}$=$-$27.1
and bolometric luminosity of $L_{\rm Bol}$=5.6$\times$10$^{13}$ $L_\odot$, J0038$-$1527 is
the most luminous quasar known at $z>7$. Deep optical to near infrared spectroscopic observations
suggest that J0038-1527 hosts a 1.3 billion solar mass BH accreting at the Eddington limit, with
an Eddington ratio of 1.25$\pm$0.19. The CIV broad emission line of J0038$-$1527 is blue-shifted
by more than 3000 km s$^{-1}$ to the systemic redshift. More detailed investigations of the high
quality spectra reveal three extremely high velocity CIV broad absorption lines (BALs) with velocity
from 0.08 to 0.14 times the speed of light and total balnicity index of more than 5000 km s$^{-1}$,
suggesting the presence of relativistic outflows. J0038$-$1527 is the first quasar found at the
epoch of reionization (EoR) with such strong outflows and provides a unique laboratory to investigate
AGN feedback on the formation and growth of the most massive galaxies in the early universe.
