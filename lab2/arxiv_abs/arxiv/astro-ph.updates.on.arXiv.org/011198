In this white paper (WP), we highlight several examples of small and moderate aperture telescopes
that are being used for education and/or research. We further discuss potential costs for establishing
new, small observatories, as well as joining existing international consortia. The WP includes
a brief overview of select observing sites, with a discussion on how small telescopes at exceptional
observing locations can be competitive, under certain circumstances, with larger and more expensive
facilities located at poorer sites. In addition to research, these facilities enable many different
types of educational experiences for wide range of people, from high school students to undergraduates
to graduate students to postdocs. Canada should remain committed to partnering with large, international
observatories such as CFHT, Gemini, and TMT, but it should also negotiate international agreements
and commit funding to expand the use of small and moderate research observatories at domestic and
international sites through coordination with the NRC, the Tri-Council, and the Canadian Foundation
for Innovation. Both capital and operational costs (with site rental costs allowed) need to be included
in support possibilities. CASCA should establish and maintain a small to moderate telescope expression
of interest database that would help to facilitate Canadian institutions in organizing consortia,
particularly for smaller institutions. The astronomical community should work with the NRC to
make existing facilities more accessible to the astronomical community for research. This could
involve, for example, automating the Plaskett and/or providing travel funds for supporting classical
observing modes. Finally, a small to moderate aperture facility in the Arctic would be a world-class
observatory and should be advanced over the next decade.
