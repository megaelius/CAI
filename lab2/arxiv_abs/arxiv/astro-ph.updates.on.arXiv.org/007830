Studies of deuterated isotopologues of complex organic molecules can provide important constraints
on their origin in regions of star formation. In particular, the abundances of deuterated species
are very sensitive to the physical conditions in the environment where they form. Due to the low temperatures
in regions of star formation, these isotopologues are enhanced to significant levels, making detections
of multiply-deuterated species possible. However, for complex organic species, only the multiply-deuterated
variants of methanol and methyl cyanide have been reported so far. The aim of this paper is to initiate
the characterisation of multiply-deuterated variants of complex organic species with the first
detection of doubly-deuterated methyl formate, CHD2OCHO. We use ALMA observations from the Protostellar
Interferometric Line Survey (PILS) of the protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422, in the spectral
range of 329.1 GHz to 362.9 GHz. We report the first detection of doubly-deuterated methyl formate
CHD2OCHO in the ISM. The D/H ratio of CHD2OCHO is found to be 2-3 times higher than the D/H ratio of CH2DOCHO
for both sources, similar to the results for formaldehyde from the same dataset. The observations
are compared to a gas-grain chemical network coupled to a dynamical physical model, tracing the
evolution of a molecular cloud until the end of the Class 0 protostellar stage. The overall D/H ratio
enhancements found in the observations are of the same order of magnitude as the predictions from
the model for the early stages of Class 0 protostars. However, the higher D/H ratio of CHD2OCHO compared
to the D/H ratio of CH2DOCHO is still not predicted by the model. This suggests that a mechanism is
enhancing the D/H ratio of singly- and doubly-deuterated methyl formate that is not in the model,
e.g. mechanisms for H-D substitutions.
