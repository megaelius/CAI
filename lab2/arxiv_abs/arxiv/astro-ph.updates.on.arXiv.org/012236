We describe the PDFI_SS software library, which is designed to find the electric field at the Sun's
photosphere from a sequence of vector magnetogram and Doppler velocity measurements, and estimates
of horizontal velocities obtained from local correlation tracking using the recently upgraded
FLCT code. The library, a collection of Fortran subroutines, uses the "PDFI" technique described
by Kazachenko et al. (2014), but modified for use in spherical, Plate-Carr\'ee geometry on a staggered
grid. The domain over which solutions are found is a subset of the global spherical surface, defined
by user-specified limits of colatitude and longitude. Our staggered-grid approach, based on that
of Yee (1966), is more conservative and self-consistent compared to the centered, Cartesian grid
used by Kazachenko et al. (2014). The library can be used to compute an end-to-end solution for electric
fields from data taken by the HMI instrument aboard NASA's SDO Mission. This capability has been
incorporated into the HMI pipeline processing system operating at SDO's JSOC. The library is written
in a general and modular way so that the calculations can be customized to modify or delete electric
field contributions, or used with other data sets. Other applications include "nudging" numerical
models of the solar atmosphere to facilitate assimilative simulations. The library includes an
ability to compute "global" (whole-Sun) electric field solutions. The library also includes an
ability to compute Potential Magnetic Field solutions in spherical coordinates. This distribution
includes a number of test programs which allow the user to test the software.
