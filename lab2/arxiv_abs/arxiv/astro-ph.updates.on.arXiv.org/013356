Galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs) remain among the most challenging yet informative
quantities to reproduce in simulations due to the large and complex mixture of physical processes
that shape the radiation output of a galaxy. With the increasing number of surveys utilising broadband
colours as part of their target selection criteria, the production of realistic SEDs in simulations
is necessary for assisting in survey design and interpretation of observations. The recent success
in reproducing the observed luminosity functions (LF) from far-UV to far-IR, using the state-of-the-art
semi-analytic model Shark and the SED generator ProSpect, represents a critical step towards better
galaxy colour predictions. We show that with Shark and ProSpect we can closely reproduce the optical
colour distributions observed in the panchromatic GAMA survey. The treatment of feedback, star
formation, central-satellite interactions and radiation re-processing by dust are critical
for this achievement. The first three processes are responsible for the colour bimodality, while
dust attenuation defines the mean and scatter of the blue and red populations. While a naive comparison
between observation and simulations displays the known issue of over-quenching of satellite galaxies,
the introduction of empirically-motivated observational errors and classification from the
same group finder used in GAMA greatly reduces this tension. The introduction of random re-assignment
of $\sim15\%$ of centrals/satellites as satellites/centrals on the simulation classification
closely resembles the outcome of the group finder, providing a computationally less intensive
method to compare simulations with observations.
