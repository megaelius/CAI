Combining the resolving power of long-baseline interferometry with the high-dynamic range capability
of nulling still remains the only technique that can directly sense the presence of structures in
the innermost regions of extrasolar planetary systems. Ultimately, the performance of any nuller
architecture is constrained by the partial resolution of the on-axis star whose light it attempts
to cancel out, and the design of nullers focuses on increasing the order of the extinction to reduce
the sensitivity to this effect. However from the ground, the effective performance of nulling is
dominated by residual time-varying instrumental phase errors that keep the instrument off the
null. This is similar to what happens with high-contrast imaging, and is what we aim to ameliorate.
We introduce a modified nuller architecture that enables the extraction of information that is
robust against piston excursions. Our method generalizes the concept of kernel, now applied to
the outputs of the modified nuller so as to make them robust to second order pupil phase error. We present
the general method to determine these kernel-outputs and highlight the benefits of this novel approach.
We present the properties of VIKiNG: the VLTI Infrared Kernel NullinG, an instrument concept within
the Hi-5 framework for the 4-UT VLTI infrastructure that takes advantage of the proposed architecture,
to produce three self-calibrating nulled outputs. Stabilized by a fringe-tracker that would bring
piston-excursions down to 50 nm, this instrument would be able to directly detect more than a dozen
extrasolar planets so-far detected by radial velocity only, as well as many hot transiting planets
and a significant number of very young exoplanets.
