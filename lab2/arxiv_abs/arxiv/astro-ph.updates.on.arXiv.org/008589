The nearby metal-poor giant HD122563 is an important astrophysical laboratory for which to test
stellar atmospheric and interior physics. It is also a benchmark star for which to calibrate methods
to apply to large scale surveys. Recently it has been remeasured using various methodologies given
the new high precision instruments at our disposal. However, inconsistencies in the observations
and models have been found. In order to better characterise this star we have been measuring its radial
velocities since 2016 using the Hertzsprung telescope (SONG network node). In this work we report
the first detections of sun-like oscillations in this star, and to our knowledge, a detection in
the most metal-poor giant to date. We apply the classical seismic scaling relation to derive a new
surface gravity of $\log g_{\nu} = 1.39 \pm 0.01$ dex. Constraints on the mass imposed by its PopII
giant classification then yield a radius of $30.8 \pm 1.0$ R$_{\odot}$. By coupling this with recent
interferometric measurements we infer a distance to the star of 306 $\pm$ 9 pc. Data from the Gaia
mission corroborates the distance hypothesis ($d_{\rm GDR2}$ = 290 $\pm$ 5 pc), and thus the updated
fundamental parameters. We confirm the validity of the seismic scaling relation without corrections
for surface gravity in metal-poor and evolved star regimes. The small discrepancy of 0.04 dex reduces
to 0.02 dex by applying corrections to the scaling relations. The new constraints on the HR diagram
($L_{\odot} = 381 \pm 26$) reduce the disagreement between the stellar parameters and evolution
models, however, a discrepancy still exists. Fine-tuned stellar evolution calculations show
that this can be reconciled by changing the mixing-length parameter by an amount (--0.35) that is
in agreement with predictions from recent 3D simulations and empirical results.
