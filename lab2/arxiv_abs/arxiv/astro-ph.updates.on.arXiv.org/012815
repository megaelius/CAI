Present time-domain astronomy efforts will unveil a variety of rare transients. We focus here on
pulsational pair-instability evolution, which can result in signatures observable with electromagnetic
and gravitational waves. We simulate grids of bare helium stars to characterize the resulting black
hole (BH) masses and ejecta composition, velocity, and thermal state. The stars do not react "elastically"
to the thermonuclear explosion: there is not a one-to-one correspondence between pair-instability
driven ignition and mass ejections, causing ambiguity in what is an observable pulse. In agreement
with previous studies, we find that for carbon-oxygen core masses 28Msun< M_CO<30.5Msun the explosions
are not strong enough to affect the surface. With increasing mass, they first cause large radial
expansion (30.5Msun<M_CO<31.4Msun), and finally, also mass ejection episodes (M_CO>31.4Msun).
The lowest mass to be fully disrupted in a pair-instability supernova is M_CO=57Msun. Models with
M_CO>121Msun reach the photodisintegration regime, resulting in BHs with M_BH>125Msun. If the
pulsating models produce BHs via (weak) explosions, the previously-ejected material might be
hit by the blast wave. We characterize the H-free circumstellar material from the pulsational pair-instability
of helium cores assuming simply that the ejecta maintain a constant velocity after ejection. Our
models produce He-rich ejecta with mass 10^{-3}Msun<M_CSM<40Msun. These ejecta are typically
launched at a few thousand \kms and reach distances of ~10^{12}-10^{15} cm before core-collapse.
The delays between mass ejection events and the final collapse span a wide and mass-dependent range
(from sub-hour to 10^4 years), and the shells ejected can also collide with each other. The range
of properties we find suggests a possible connection with (some) type Ibn supernovae.
