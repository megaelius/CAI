Unimodular gravity is an appealing approach to address the cosmological constant problem. In this
scenario, the vacuum energy density of quantum fields does not gravitate and the cosmological constant
appears merely as an integration constant. Recently, it has been shown that energy diffusion that
may arise in quantum gravity and in theories with spontaneous collapse is compatible with this framework
by virtue of its restricted diffeomorphism invariance. New studies suggest that this phenomenon
could lead to higher-order equations in the context of homogeneous and isotropic Universe, affecting
the well-posedness of their Cauchy initial-value problem. In this work, we show that this issue
can be circumvented by assuming an equation of state that relates the energy density to the function
that characterizes the diffusion. As an application, we solve the field equations analytically
for an isotropic and homogeneous Universes in a barotropic model and in the mass-proportional continuous
spontaneous localization (CSL) scenario, assuming that only dark matter develops energy diffusion.
Different solutions possessing phase transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion are
found. We use cosmological data of type Ia Supernovae and observational Hubble data to constrain
the free parameters of both models. It is found that very small but nontrivial energy nonconservation
is compatible with the barotropic model. However, for the CSL model, we find that the best-fit values
are not compatible with previous laboratory experiments. We comment on this fact and propose future
directions to explore energy diffusion in cosmology.
