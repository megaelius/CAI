Interior characterization traditionally relies on individual planetary properties, ignoring
correlations between different planets of the same system. For multi-planetary systems, planetary
data are generally correlated. This is because, the differential masses and radii are better constrained
than absolute planetary masses and radii. We explore such correlations and data specific to the
multiplanetary-system of TRAPPIST-1 and study their value for our understanding of planet interiors.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the rocky interior of planets in a multi-planetary system can
be preferentially probed by studying the most dense planet representing a rocky interior analogue.
Our methodology includes a Bayesian inference analysis that uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme.
Our interior estimates account for the anticipated variability in the compositions and layer thicknesses
of core, mantle, water oceans and ice layers, and a gas envelope. Our results show that (1) interior
estimates significantly depend on available abundance proxies and (2) that the importance of inter-dependent
planetary data for interior characterization is comparable to changes in data precision by 30 %.
For the interiors of TRAPPIST-1 planets, we find that possible water mass fractions generally range
from 0-25 %. The lack of a clear trend of water budgets with orbital period or planet mass challenges
possible formation scenarios. While our estimates change relatively little with data precision,
they critically depend on data accuracy. If planetary masses varied within ~24 %, interiors would
be consistent with uniform (~7 %) or an increasing water mass fractions with orbital period (~2-12
%).
