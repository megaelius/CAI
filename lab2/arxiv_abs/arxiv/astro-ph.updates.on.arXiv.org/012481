We used the APEX telescope to observe the 372 GHz o-H$_2$D$^+(J_{K_a,\,K_c}=1_{1,\,0}-1_{1,\,1})$
line towards three prestellar cores and three protostellar cores in Orion B9. We also employed our
previous APEX observations of C$^{17}$O, C$^{18}$O, N$_2$H$^+$, and N$_2$D$^+$ line emission,
and 870 $\mu$m dust continuum emission towards the target sources. The o-H$_2$D$^+$ line was detected
in all three prestellar cores, but in only one of the protostellar cores. The corresponding o-H$_2$D$^+$
abundances were derived to be $\sim(12-30)\times10^{-11}$ and $6\times10^{-11}$. Two additional
spectral lines, DCO$^+(5-4)$ and N$_2$H$^+(4-3)$, were detected in the observed frequency bands
with high detection rates of $100\%$ and $83\%$, respectively. The Orion B9 cores were found to be
consistent with the relationship between the o-H$_2$D$^+$ abundance and gas temperature obeyed
by other low-mass dense cores. The o-H$_2$D$^+$ abundance was found to decrease as the core evolves.
The o-H$_2$D$^+$ abundances in the Orion B9 cores are in line with those found in other low-mass cores
and larger than derived for high-mass star-forming regions. The higher o-H$_2$D$^+$ abundance
in prestellar cores compared to that in cores hosting protostars is to be expected from chemical
reactions where higher concentrations of gas-phase CO and elevated gas temperature accelerate
the destruction of H$_2$D$^+$. The validity of using the [o-H$_2$D$^+$]/[N$_2$D$^+$] ratio as
an evolutionary indicator, which has been proposed for massive clumps, remains to be determined
when applied to these target cores. Overall, as located in a dynamic environment of Orion B, the Orion
B9 filament provides an interesting target system to investigate the deuterium-based chemistry,
and further observations of species like para-H$_2$D$^+$ and D$_2$H$^+$ would be of particular
interest.
