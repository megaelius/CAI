We study the effects of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) on the abundance analysis of
barium, magnesium, and manganese from integrated light spectroscopy, as typically applied to
the analysis of extra-galactic star clusters and galaxies. In this paper, our reference object
is a synthetic simple stellar population (SSP) representing a mono-metallic alpha-enhanced globular
cluster with the metallicity [Fe/H]=-2.0 and the age of 11 Gyr. We used the MULTI2.3 program to compute
LTE and NLTE equivalent widths of spectral lines of Mg I, Mn I, and Ba II ions, which are commonly used
in abundance analyses of extra-galactic stellar populations. We used ATLAS12 model atmospheres
for stellar parameters sampled from a model isochrone to represent individual stars in the model
SSP. The NLTE and LTE equivalent widths calculated for the individual stars were combined to calculate
the SSP NLTE corrections. We find that the NLTE abundance corrections for the integrated light spectra
of the the metal-poor globular cluster are significant in many cases, and often exceed 0.1 dex. In
particular, LTE abundances of Mn are consistently under-estimated by 0.3 dex for all optical lines
of Mn I studied in this work. On the other hand, Ba II, and Mg I lines show a strong differential effect:
the NLTE abundance corrections for the individual stars and integrated light spectra are close
to zero for the low-excitation lines, but they amount to -0.15 dex for the strong high-excitation
lines. Our results emphasise the need to take NLTE effects into account in the analysis of spectra
of individual stars and integrated light spectra of stellar populations.
