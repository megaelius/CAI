Ultra hot Jupiters orbit very close to their host star and consequently receive strong irradiation
that makes their atmospheric chemistry different from the common gas giants. Here, we study the
atmosphere of one of these particular hot planets, MASCARA-2b/KELT-20b, using four transit observations
with high resolution spectroscopy facilities. Three of these observations were performed with
HARPS-N and one with CARMENES. We simultaneously observed one of the transits with MuSCAT2 to monitor
possible spots in the stellar surface. At high resolution, the transmission residuals show the
effects of Rossiter-McLaughlin and center-to-limb variations from the stellar lines profiles,
which we correct to finally extract the transmission spectra of the planet. We clearly observe absorption
of CaII, FeII, NaI, H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ in the atmosphere of MASCARA-2b, and indications of H$\gamma$
and MgI at low SNR. The results obtained with CARMENES and HARPS-N are consistent, measuring an H$\alpha$
absorption depth of $0.68\pm0.05\%$ and $0.59\pm0.07\%$, and NaI absorption of $0.11\pm0.04\%$
and $0.09\pm0.05\%$ ($0.75\r{A}$ passband), in both instruments respectively. For H$\beta$
only HARPS-N covers this wavelength range, measuring $0.28\pm0.06\%$ of absorption. The CaII
is only covered with CARMENES, measuring an average absorption of $0.32\pm0.05\%$. Three additional
FeII lines are observed in the transmission spectrum by HARPS-N, with mean absorption depth of $0.08\pm0.04\%$.
The results presented here are consistent with theoretical models of ultra hot Jupiters atmospheres,
suggesting the emergence of an ionised gas on the day-side of such planets. Ca and Fe, with other elements,
are expected to be singly ionised at these temperatures and be more numerous than its neutral state.
The CaII triplet lines are detected here for the first time in transmission in an exoplanet atmosphere.
