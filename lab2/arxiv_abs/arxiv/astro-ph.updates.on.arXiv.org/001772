We present the result of a study on the expansion properties and internal kinematics of round/elliptical
planetary nebulae of the Milky Way disk, the halo, and of the globular cluster M15. The purpose of
this study is to considerably enlarge the small sample of nebulae with precisely determined expansion
properties. To this aim, we selected a representative sample of objects with different evolutionary
stages and metallicities and conducted high-resolution echelle spectroscopy. In most cases,
we succeeded in detecting the weak signals from the outer nebular shell which are attached to the
main line emission from the bright nebular rim. Next to the measurement of the motion of the rim gas
by decomposition of the main line components into Gaussians, we were able to measure separately,
for most objects for the first time, the gas velocity immediately behind the leading shock of the
shell, i.e. the post-shock velocity. We more than doubled the number of objects for which the velocities
of both rim and shell are known and confirm that the overall expansion of planetary nebulae is accelerating
with time. There are, however, differences between the expansion behaviour of the shell and the
rim. This observed distinct velocity evolution of both rim and shell is explained by radiation-hydrodynamics
simulations, at least qualitatively. Because of the time-dependent boundary conditions, a planetary
nebula will never evolve into a simple self-similar expansion. Also the metal-poor objects behave
as theory predicts: The post-shock velocities are higher and the rim flow velocities are equal or
even lower compared to disk objects at similar evolutionary stage. We detected, for the first time,
in some objects an asymmetric expansion behaviour: The relative expansions between rim and shell
appear to be different for the receding and approaching parts of the nebular envelope.
