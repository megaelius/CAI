The available set of spin and shape modelled asteroids is strongly biased against slowly rotating
targets and those with low lightcurve amplitudes. As a consequence of these selection effects,
the current picture of asteroid spin axis distribution, rotation rates, or radiometric properties,
might be affected too. To counteract these selection effects, we are running a photometric campaign
of a large sample of main belt asteroids omitted in most previous studies. We determined synodic
rotation periods and verified previous determinations. When a dataset for a given target was sufficiently
large and varied, we performed spin and shape modelling with two different methods. We used the convex
inversion method and the non-convex SAGE algorithm, applied on the same datasets of dense lightcurves.
Unlike convex inversion, the SAGE method allows for the existence of valleys and indentations on
the shapes based only on lightcurves. We obtained detailed spin and shape models for the first five
targets of our sample: (159) Aemilia, (227) Philosophia, (329) Svea, (478) Tergeste, and (487)
Venetia. When compared to stellar occultation chords, our models obtained an absolute size scale
and major topographic features of the shape models were also confirmed. When applied to thermophysical
modelling, they provided a very good fit to the infrared data and allowed their size, albedo, and
thermal inertia to be determined. Convex and non-convex shape models provide comparable fits to
lightcurves. However, some non-convex models fit notably better to stellar occultation chords
and to infrared data in sophisticated thermophysical modelling (TPM). In some cases TPM showed
strong preference for one of the spin and shape solutions. Also, we confirmed that slowly rotating
asteroids tend to have higher-than-average values of thermal inertia.
