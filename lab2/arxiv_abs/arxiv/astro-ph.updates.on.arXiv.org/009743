The presence of short-lived ($\sim$\,Myr) radioactive isotopes in meteoritic inclusions at the
time of their formation represents a unique opportunity to study the circumstances that led to the
formation of the Solar System. To interpret these observations we need to calculate the evolution
of radioactive-to-stable isotopic ratios in the Galaxy. We present an extension of the open-source
galactic chemical evolution codes NuPyCEE and JINAPyCEE that enables to track the decay of radioactive
isotopes in the interstellar medium. We show how the evolution of isotopic ratio depends on the star
formation history and efficiency, star-to-gas mass ratio, and galactic outflows. Given the uncertainties
in the observations used to calibrate our model, our predictions for isotopic ratios at the time
of formation of the Sun are uncertain by a factor of 3.6. At that time, to recover the actual radioactive-to-stable
isotopic ratios predicted by our model, one can multiply the steady-state solution (see Equation~1)
by $2.3^{+3.4}_{-0.7}$. However, in the cases where the radioactive isotope has a half-life longer
than $\sim$\,200\,Myr, or the target radioactive or stable isotopes have mass- and/or metallicity-depended
production rates, or they originate from different sources with different delay-time distributions,
or the reference isotope is radioactive, our codes should be used for more accurate solutions. Our
preliminary calculations confirm the dichotomy between radioactive nuclei in the early Solar
System with $r$- and $s$-process origin, and that $^{55}$Mn and $^{60}$Fe can be explained by galactic
chemical evolution, while $^{26}$Al cannot.
