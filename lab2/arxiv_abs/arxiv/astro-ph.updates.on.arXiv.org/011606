We present an analysis of the mass distribution inferred from strong lensing by SPT-CL J0356-5337,
a cluster of galaxies at redshift z = 1.0359 revealed in the follow-up of the SPT-SZ clusters. The
cluster has an Einstein radius of Erad=14 for a source at z = 3 and a mass within 500 kpc of M_500kpc =
4.0+-0.8x10^14Msol. Our spectroscopic identification of three multiply-imaged systems (z =
2.363, z = 2.364, and z = 3.048), combined with HST F606W-band imaging allows us to build a strong lensing
model for this cluster with an rms of <0.3'' between the predicted and measured positions of the multiple
images. Our modeling reveals a two-component mass distribution in the cluster. One mass component
is dominated by the brightest cluster galaxy and the other component, separated by ~170 kpc, contains
a group of eight red elliptical galaxies confined in a ~9'' (~70 kpc) diameter circle. We estimate
the mass ratio between the two components to be between 1:1.25 and 1:1.58. In addition, spectroscopic
data reveal that these two near-equal mass cores have only a small velocity difference of 300 km/s
between the two components. This small radial velocity difference suggests that most of the relative
velocity takes place in the plane of the sky, and implies that SPT-CL J0356-5337 is a major merger
with a small impact parameter seen face-on. We also assess the relative contributions of galaxy-scale
halos to the overall mass of the core of the cluster and find that within 800 kpc from the brightest
cluster galaxy about 27% of the total mass can be attributed to visible and dark matter associated
with galaxies, whereas only 73% of the total mass in the core comes from cluster-scale dark matter
halos.
