It is well-known that r-mode oscillations of rotating neutron stars may be unstable with respect
to the gravitational wave emission. It is highly unlikely to observe a neutron star with the parameters
within the instability window, a domain where this instability is not suppressed. But if one adopts
the `minimal' (nucleonic) composition of the stellar interior, a lot of observed stars appear to
be within the r-mode instability window. One of the possible solutions to this problem is to account
for hyperons in the neutron star core. The presence of hyperons allows for a set of powerful (lepton-free)
non-equilibrium weak processes, which increase the bulk viscosity, and thus suppress the r-mode
instability. Existing calculations of the instability windows for hyperon NSs generally use reaction
rates calculated for the $\Sigma^-\Lambda$ hyperonic composition via the contact $W$ boson exchange
interaction. In contrast, here we employ hyperonic equations of state where the $\Lambda$ and $\Xi^-$
are the first hyperons to appear (the $\Sigma^-$'s, if they are present, appear at much larger densities),
and consider the meson exchange channel, which is more effective for the lepton-free weak processes.
We calculate the bulk viscosity for the non-paired $npe\mu\Lambda\Xi^-$ matter using the meson
exchange weak interaction. A number of viscosity-generating non-equilibrium processes is considered
(some of them for the first time in the neutron-star context). The calculated reaction rates and
bulk viscosity are approximated by simple analytic formulas, easy-to-use in applications. Applying
our results to calculation of the instability window, we argue that accounting for hyperons may
be a viable solution to the r-mode problem.
