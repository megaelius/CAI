Axion Like Particle (ALP) is a hypothetical particle of quantum field which works to conserve CP
symmetry in the strong interaction, and also one of candidates of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) in the
Universe. ALP can be converted into photons via its interaction with magnetic field, the so-called
inverse Primakoff effect. If an ALP is the main component of dark matter, or dark matter would decay
into ALPs, almost isotropic distribution is expected, and photons from ALPs contribute to diffuse
background radiation in corresponding waveband. In this work, we propose a novel method to uncover
ALP induced photons by space observatory using the Earth's magnetic field to induce the inverse
Primakoff process. In X-ray band, a CCD camera system, XIS, which is onboard {\it Suzaku} satellite
is suitable for this purpose because of its low intrinsic background. The four deep fields are selected
from the archival data, and evaluated the diffuse background spectra as a function of the integrated
magnetic field in the direction of target fields that amounts to an order of $10^2$ T m, larger than
that in a terrestrial experiment. If the ALPs are produced from dark matter at a cosmological distance,
a continuum spectrum as $dN/dE$ $\propto$ $E^{+0.5}$ is expected. We can set the upper limit at 99\%
{\it CL} for a continuum emission from the ALPs converted by the Earth magnetosphere to be $1.6\times
10^{-9}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ normalized at $10^4$ T$^2$ m$^2$ with a detailed study
of the intrinsic background reproduction and systematic errors. It corresponds to the 6--15\%
of the observed cosmic X-ray background(CXB) surface brightness in 2--6 keV, and is not contradictory
to the current understanding of the CXB , that 75--80\% of the CXB are resolved into the sum of point
sources. This search is complementary to other ALP search experiments.
