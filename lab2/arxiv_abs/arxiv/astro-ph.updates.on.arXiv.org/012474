The hierarchical three-body problem has many applications in relativistic astrophysics, and
can potentially explain all of the binary black hole mergers detected by LIGO/Virgo. However, the
majority of studies have only included relativistic corrections to the two-body equations of motion,
and have ignored the relativistic effects that arise in the presence of a third body. We revisit this
problem and develop a fully consistent derivation of the secular three-body problem to first post-Newtonian
order. We start with the Einstein-Infeld-Hoffman equations for a three-body system and expand
the accelerations as a power series in the ratio of the semi-major axes of the inner ($a_1$) and outer
($a_2$) binary. We then perform a post-Keplerian, two-parameter expansion of the single orbit-averaged
Lagrange planetary equations in $\delta = v^2/c^2$ and $\epsilon = a_1/a_2$ using the method of
multiple scales. It is well established that eccentricity growth through the Lidov-Kozai (LK)
mechanism can be suppressed or amplified by two-body 1pN (2BpN) precession. In this study, we derive
and investigate three-body 1pN (3BpN) effects. We find that these effects can lead to eccentricity
growth in triples, occurring over hundreds of LK cycles. The octupole terms can enhance these effects
and lead to even greater eccentricities. In such cases, inclusion of these effects can substantially
alter the evolution of three-body systems as compared to an analysis in which they are neglected.
Careful analysis of post-Newtonian three-body effects will be important to understand the formation
and properties of coalescing binaries that form via three-body dynamical processes.
