When comet nuclei approach the Sun, the increasing energy flux through the surface layers leads
to sublimation of the underlying ices and subsequent outgassing that promotes the observed emission
of gas and dust. The ejection of dust requires that the forces binding the dust particles to the comet
nucleus must be overcome by the forces caused by the sublimation process. This relates to the question
of how large the tensile strength of the overlying dust layer is. Homogeneous layers of micrometer-sized
dust particles reach tensile strengths of typically $10^3$ to $10^4$ Pa. This exceeds by far the
maximum sublimation pressure of water ice in comets. It is therefore unclear how cometary dust activity
is driven. To solve this paradox, we used the model by Skorov and Blum (Icarus 221, 1-11, 2012), who
assumed that cometesimals formed by gravitational instability of a cloud of dust and ice aggregates
and calculated for the corresponding structure of comet nuclei tensile strength of the dust-aggregate
layers on the order of 1 Pa. Here we present evidence that the emitted cometary dust particles are
indeed aggregates with the right properties to fit the model by Skorov and Blum. Then we experimentally
measure the tensile strengths of layers of laboratory dust aggregates and confirm the values derived
by the model. To explain the comet activity driven by the evaporation of water ice, we derive a minimum
size for the dust aggregates of $\sim 1$ mm, in agreement with meteoroid observations and dust-agglomeration
models in the solar nebula. Finally we conclude that cometesimals must have formed by gravitational
instability, because all alternative formation models lead to higher tensile strengths of the
surface layers.
