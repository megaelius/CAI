Galactic encounters are usually marked by a substantial increase of synchrotron emission of the
interacting galaxies compared to the typical emission from similar isolated galaxies. This is
believed to be associated with an increase of the star formation rate and the associated turbulent
magnetic fields. The regular magnetic field is usually believed to decrease. We consider a simple,
however rather realistic, mean-field galactic dynamo model where the effects of small-scale generation
are represented by random injections of magnetic field from star forming regions. We represent
an encounter by the introduction of large-scale streaming velocities and by an increase in small-scale
magnetic field injections. The latter describes the effect of an increase of the star formation
rate caused by the encounter. We demonstrate that large-scale streaming, with associated deviations
in the rotation curve, can result in an enhancement of the anisotropic turbulent (ordered) magnetic
field strength, mainly along the azimuthal direction, leading to a significant temporary increase
of the total magnetic energy during the encounter; the representation of an increase in star formation
rate has an additional strong effect. In contrast to expectations, the large-scale (regular) magnetic
field structure is not significantly destroyed by the encounter. It may be somewhat weakened for
a relatively short period, and its direction after the encounter may be reversed. The encounter
causes enhanced total and polarized emission without increase of the regular magnetic field strength.
The increase of synchrotron emission caused by the large-scale streaming can be comparable to the
effect of the increase of the star formation rate, depending on the choice of parameters.The effects
of the encounter on the total magnetic field energy last only slightly longer than the duration of
the encounter (ca. 1 Gyr).
