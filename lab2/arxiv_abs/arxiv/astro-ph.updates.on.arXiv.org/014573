Observations suggest an abundance of water and paucity of methane in the majority of observed exoplanetary
atmospheres. We isolate the effect of atmospheric processes to investigate possible causes. Previously,
we studied the effect of effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, carbon-to-oxygen
ratio, and stellar type assuming cloud-free thermochemical equilibrium and disequilibrium chemistry.
However, under these assumptions, methane remains a persisting spectral feature in the transmission
spectra of exoplanets over a certain parameter space, the Methane Valley. In this work we investigate
the role of clouds on this domain and we find that clouds change the spectral appearance of methane
in two direct ways: 1) by heating-up the photosphere of colder planets, and 2) by obscuring molecular
features. The presence of clouds also affects methane features indirectly: 1) cloud heating results
in more evaporation of condensates and hence releases additional oxygen, causing water dominated
spectra of colder carbon-poor exoplanets, and 2) HCN/CO production results in a suppression of
depleted methane features by these molecules. The presence of HCN/CO and a lack of methane could
be an indication of cloud formation on hot exoplanets. Cloud heating can also deplete ammonia. Therefore,
a simultaneous depletion of methane and ammonia is not unique to photochemical processes. We propose
that the best targets for methane detection are likely to be massive but smaller planets with a temperature
around 1450 K orbiting colder stars. We also construct Spitzer synthetic color-maps and find that
clouds can explain some of the high contrast observations by IRAC's channel 1 and 2.
