We present an analysis using the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey on the nature of "MIR-excess"
galaxies, which have star formation rates (SFR) inferred from mid-infrared (MIR) data that is substantially
elevated relative to that estimated from dust-corrected UV data. We use a sample of $\sim$200 galaxies
and AGN at $1.40<z<2.61$ with 24 $\mu$m detections (rest-frame 8$\mu$m) from MIPS/\textit{Spitzer}.
We find that the identification of MIR-excess galaxies strongly depends on the methodologies used
to estimate IR luminosity ($\rm L_{IR}$) and to correct the UV light for dust attenuation. We find
that extrapolations of the SFR from the observed 24 $\mu$m flux, using luminosity-dependent templates
based on local galaxies, substantially overestimate $\rm L_{IR}$ in $z\sim2$ galaxies. By including
\textit{Herschel} observations and using a stellar mass-dependent, luminosity-independent
$\rm L_{IR}$, we obtain more reliable estimates of the SFR and a lower fraction of MIR-excess galaxies.
Once stellar mass selection biases are taken into account, we identify $\sim24\%$ of our galaxies
as MIR-excess. However, $\rm SFR_{H\alpha}$ is not elevated in MIR-excess galaxies compared to
MIR-normal galaxies, indicating that the intrinsic fraction of MIR-excess may be lower. Using
X-ray, IR, and optically-selected AGN in MOSDEF, we do not find a higher prevalence for AGN in MIR-excess
galaxies relative to MIR-normal galaxies. A stacking analysis of X-ray undetected galaxies does
not reveal a harder spectrum in MIR-excess galaxies relative to MIR-normal galaxies. Our analysis
indicates that AGN activity does not contribute substantially to the MIR excess and instead implies
that it is likely due to the enhanced PAH emission.
