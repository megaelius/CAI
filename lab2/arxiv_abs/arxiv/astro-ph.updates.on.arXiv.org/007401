We have used narrow-band [OIII]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 and H$\alpha$+[NII]$\lambda\lambda6548,84$
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of 9 luminous (L[OIII]$>10^{42}$erg s$^{-1}$) type 2 QSOs
with redshifts $0.1<z<0.5$ in order to constrain the geometry of their Extended Narrow-Line Regions
(ENLR), as recent ground-based studies suggest these regions become more spherical at high luminosities
due to destruction of the torus. We find instead elongated ENLRs reaching 4 to 19 kpc from the nucleus
and bipolar ionization cones in [OIII]/(H$\alpha$+[NII]) excitation maps indicating that the
torus survives these luminosities, allowing the escape of $\approx$10 times higher ionizing photon
rates along the ionization axis than perpendicularly to it. The exceptional HST angular resolution
was key to our success in arriving at these conclusions. Combining our measurements with previous
ones based on similar HST data, we have revisited the relation between the ENLR radius R$_{maj}$
(in pc) and L[OIII] (in erg s$^{-1}$) over the range $39<$log(L[OIII])$<43.5$: log(R$_{maj})
= (0.51\pm0.03)$ log(L[OIII])$-18.12\pm0.98$. The radius of the ENLR keeps increasing with L[OIII]
in our data, implying that the ENLR can extend to distances beyond the limit of the galaxy if gas is
present there $-$ e.g. from AGN outflows or interactions, seen in 6 objects of our sample. We attribute
the flattening previously seen in this relation to the fact that the ENLR is matter-bounded, meaning
that ionizing photons usually escape to the intergalactic medium in luminous AGN. Estimated ionized
gas masses of the ENLRs range from 0.3 to $2\times10^8$ M$_{\odot}$, and estimated powers for associated
outflows range from $<0.1\%$ to a few percent of the QSO luminosity.
