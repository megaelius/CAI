We study particle clustering in a temperature stratified turbulence with small finite correlation
time. It is shown that the temperature stratified turbulence strongly increases the degree of compressibility
of particle velocity field. This results in the strong decrease of the threshold for the excitation
of the tangling clustering instability even for small particles. The tangling clustering instability
in the temperature stratified turbulence is essentially different from the inertial clustering
instability that occurs in non-stratified isotropic and homogeneous turbulence. While the inertial
clustering instability is caused by the centrifugal effect of the turbulent eddies, the mechanism
of the tangling clustering instability is related to the temperature fluctuations generated by
the tangling of the mean temperature gradient by the velocity fluctuations. Temperature fluctuations
produce pressure fluctuations and cause particle clustering in regions with increased pressure
fluctuations. It is shown that the growth rate of the tangling clustering instability is much larger
than that of the inertial clustering instability. It is found that depending on the parameters of
the turbulence and the mean temperature gradient there is a preferential particle size at which
the particle clustering due to the tangling clustering instability is more effective. The particle
number density inside the cluster after the saturation of this instability can be in several orders
of magnitude larger than the mean particle number density. It is also demonstrated that the evaporation
of droplets drastically change the tangling clustering instability, e.g., it increases the instability
threshold in the droplet radius. The tangling clustering instability is of a great importance,
e.g., in atmospheric turbulence with temperature inversions.
