The 1.0 metre f/4 fast-slew Zadko Telescope was installed in June 2008 approximately seventy kilometres
north of Perth at Yeal, in the Shire of Gingin, Western Australia. Since the Zadko Telescope has been
in operation it has proven its worth by detecting numerous Gamma Ray Burst afterglows, two of these
being the most distant `optical transients' imaged by an Australian telescope. Other projects
include a contract with the European Space Agency (ESA) to image potentially hazardous near Earth
asteroids (2019), monitoring space weather on nearby stars (2019), and photometry of a transit
of Saturn's moon Titan (2018). Another active Zadko Telescope project is tracking Geo-stationary
satellites and attempting to use photometry to classify various space debris (defunct satellites).
The Zadko Telescope's importance as a potential tool for education, training, and public outreach
cannot be underestimated, as the global awareness of the importance of astronomy (and space science)
as a context for teaching science continues to increase. An example of this was the national media
coverage of its contribution to the discovery of colliding neutron stars in 2017, capturing the
imagination of the public. In this proceeding, I will focus on the practical aspects of managing
a robotic Observatory, focusing on the sustainability of the Observatory and the technical management
involved in hosting different commercial projects. I will review the evolution of the Observatory,
from its early, single instrument, state to its current multi-telescope and multi-instrument
capabilities. I will finish by outlining the future of the Observatory and the site.
