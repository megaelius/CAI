Since the birth of X-ray Astronomy, spectacular advances have been seen in the imaging, spectroscopic
and timing studies of the hot and violent X-ray Universe, and further leaps forward are expected
in the future. On the other hand, polarimetry is very much lagging behind: after the measurements
of the Crab Nebula and Scorpius X-1, obtained by OSO-8 in the 70s, no more observations have been performed
in the classical X-ray band, even if some interesting results have been obtained in hard X-rays and
in soft gamma-rays. The NASA/ASI mission IXPE, scheduled for the launch in 2021, is going to provide
for the first time imaging X-ray polarimetry in the 2-8 keV band thanks to its photoelectric polarimeter,
coupled with ~25'' angular resolution X-ray mirrors. Its orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity
with respect to the OSO-8 Bragg polarimeter implies scientifically meaningful polarimetric measurements
for at least the brightest specimens of most classes of X-ray sources. In 2027, the Chinese-led mission
eXTP should also be launched. In addition to timing and spectroscopic instruments, eXTP will have
on board photoelectric polarimeters very similar to those of IXPE, but with a total effective area
2-3 times larger. Building on IXPE results, eXTP will increase the number of sources for which significant
polarimetric measurements could be obtained. However, further progresses, such as exploring
a broader energy range, considering a larger effective area, improving the angular resolution,
and performing wide-field polarization measurements, are needed to reach a mature phase for X-ray
polarimetry. In the first part of this White Paper we will discuss a few scientific cases in which
a next generation X-ray Polarimetry mission can provide significant advances. In the second part,
a possible concept for a medium-class Next Generation X-ray Polarimetry (NGXP) mission will be
sketched.
