Observations show that transverse magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and flows are often simultaneously
present in magnetic loops of the solar corona. The waves are resonantly damped in the Alfv\'en continuum
because of plasma and/or magnetic field nonuniformity across the loop. The resonant damping is
relevant in the context of coronal heating, since it provides a mechanism to cascade energy down
to the dissipative scales. It has been theoretically shown that the presence of flow affects the
waves propagation and damping, but most of the studies rely on the unjustified assumption that the
transverse nonuniformity is confined to a boundary layer much thinner than the radius of the loop.
Here we present a semi-analytic technique to explore the effect of flow on resonant MHD waves in coronal
flux tubes with thick nonuniform boundaries. We extend a published method, which was originally
developed for a static plasma, in order to incorporate the effect of flow. We allowed the flow velocity
to continuously vary within the nonuniform boundary from the internal velocity to the external
velocity. The analytic part of the method is based on expressing the wave perturbations in the thick
nonuniform boundary of the loop as a Frobenius series that contains a singular term accounting for
the Alfv\'en resonance, while the numerical part of the method consists of solving iteratively
the transcendental dispersion relation together with the equation for the Alfv\'en resonance
position. As an application of this method, we investigated the impact of flow on the phase velocity
and resonant damping length of MHD kink waves. We consistently recover results in the thin boundary
approximation obtained in previous studies. We have extended those results to the case of thick
boundaries. We also explored the error associated with the use of the thin boundary approximation
beyond its regime of applicability.
