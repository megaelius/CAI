Early-type galaxies -- slow and fast rotating ellipticals (E-SRs and E-FRs) and S0s/lenticulars
-- define a Fundamental Plane (FP) in the space of half-light radius $R_e$, enclosed surface brightness
$I_e$ and velocity dispersion $\sigma_e$. Since $I_e$ and $\sigma_e$ are distance-independent
measurements, the thickness of the FP is often expressed in terms of the accuracy with which $I_e$
and $\sigma_e$ can be used to estimate sizes $R_e$. We show that: 1) The thickness of the FP depends
strongly on morphology. If the sample only includes E-SRs, then the observed scatter in $R_e$ is
$\sim 16\%$, of which only $\sim 9\%$ is intrinsic. Removing galaxies with $M_*<10^{11}M_\odot$
further reduces the observed scatter to $\sim 13\%$ ($\sim 4\%$ intrinsic). The observed scatter
increases to the $\sim 25\%$ usually quoted in the literature if E-FRs and S0s are added. If the FP
is defined using the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the observables, then the E-SRs again
define an exceptionally thin FP, with intrinsic scatter of only $5\%$ orthogonal to the plane. 2)
The structure within the FP is most easily understood as arising from the fact that $I_e$ and $\sigma_e$
are nearly independent, whereas the $R_e-I_e$ and $R_e-\sigma_e$ correlations are nearly equal
and opposite. 3) If the coefficients of the FP differ from those associated with the virial theorem
the plane is said to be `tilted'. If we multiply $I_e$ by the global stellar mass-to-light ratio $M_*/L$
and we account for non-homology across the population by using S\'ersic photometry, then the resulting
stellar mass FP is less tilted. Accounting self-consistently for $M_*/L$ gradients will change
the tilt. The tilt we currently see suggests that the efficiency of turning baryons into stars increases
and/or the dark matter fraction decreases as stellar surface brightness increases.
