Galactic cosmic rays are a ubiquitous source of ionisation of the interstellar gas, competing with
UV and X-ray photons as well as natural radioactivity in determining the fractional abundance of
electrons, ions and charged dust grains in molecular clouds and circumstellar discs. We model the
propagation of different components of Galactic cosmic rays versus the column density of the gas.
Our study is focussed on the propagation at high densities, above a few g cm$^{-2}$, especially relevant
for the inner regions of collapsing clouds and circumstellar discs. The propagation of primary
and secondary CR particles (protons and heavier nuclei, electrons, positrons, and photons) is
computed in the continuous slowing down approximation, diffusion approximation, or catastrophic
approximation, by adopting a matching procedure for the different transport regimes. A choice
of the proper regime depends on the nature of the dominant loss process, modelled as continuous or
catastrophic. The CR ionisation rate is determined by CR protons and their secondary electrons
below $\approx 130$ g cm$^{-2}$ and by electron/positron pairs created by photon decay above $\approx600$
g cm$^{-2}$. We show that a proper description of the particle transport is essential to compute
the ionisation rate in the latter case, since the electron/positron differential fluxes depend
sensitively on the fluxes of both protons and photons. Our results show that the CR ionisation rate
in high-density environments, like, e.g., the inner parts of collapsing molecular clouds or the
mid-plane of circumstellar discs, is larger than previously assumed. It does not decline exponentially
with increasing column density, but follows a more complex behaviour due to the interplay of different
processes governing the generation and propagation of secondary particles.
