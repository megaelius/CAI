We present constraints on the timescale of star formation variability and the correlation between
star formation and host halo accretion histories of star-forming (SF) central galaxies from the
scatter of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR). SF galaxies are found to have a tight relationship
between their star formation rates and stellar masses on the so-called "star-forming sequence"
(SFS), which characterizes their SF histories and $M_*$ growths. Meanwhile, observed SHMR constraints
connect $M_*$ growth to halo accretion history. Combining these observed trends with a cosmological
$N$-body simulation, we present flexible models that track the SF, $M_*$, and halo accretion histories
of SF central galaxies at $z<1$ while reproducing the observed stellar mass function and SFS in SDSS
DR7. We find that the scatter in SHMR at $M_h=10^{12}M_\odot$, $\sigma_{M_*|M_h=10^{12}M_\odot}$,
is sensitive to the timescale of star formation variability, $t_{\rm duty}$, and the correlation
coefficient, $r$, between SF and halo accretion histories: shorter $t_{\rm duty}$ and higher $r$
both result in tighter $\sigma_{M_*|M_h=10^{12}M_\odot}$. To reproduce a constant 0.2 dex scatter
over $z=1-0$, our models require $t_{\rm duty}\leq1.5$ Gyr for $r=0.99$ or $r>0.6$ for $t_{\rm
duty}=0.1$ Gyr. For $r\sim0.6$, as found in the literature, $t_{\rm duty}<0.2$ Gyr is necessary.
Meanwhile, to reproduce the tightening of $\sigma_{M_*|M_h=10^{12}M_\odot}=0.35$ to 0.2 dex
from $z=1-0$ in hydrodynamical simulations, our models require $t_{\rm duty}=0.1$ Gyr for $r>0.5$.
Although, the lack of consensus on $\sigma_{M_*|M_h=10^{12}M_\odot}$ at $M_h=10^{12}M_\odot$
and at $z=1$ from observations and galaxy formation models remains the main bottleneck in precisely
constraining $r$ and $t_{\rm duty}$, we demonstrate that SHMR can be used to constrain the SF and
host halo accretion histories of SF central galaxies.
