We used 0.85 - 5.1 micron 2006 observations by Cassini's Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer
(VIMS) to constrain the unusual vertical structure and compositions of cloud layers in Saturn's
south polar region, the site of a powerful vortex circulation, shadow-casting cloud bands, and
spectral evidence of ammonia ice clouds without the lightning usually associated with such features.
We modeled spectral observations with a 4-layer model that includes (1) a stratospheric haze, (2)
a top tropospheric layer of non-absorbing (possibly diphosphine) particles near 300 mbar, with
a fraction of an optical depth (much less than found elsewhere on Saturn), (3) a moderately thicker
layer (1 - 2 optical depths) of ammonia ice particles near 900 mbar, and (4) extending from 5 bars up
to 2-4 bars, an assumed optically thick layer where NH4SH and H20 are likely condensables. What makes
the 3-micron absorption of ammonia ice unexpectedly apparent in these polar clouds, is not penetrating
convection, but instead the relatively low optical depth of the top tropospheric cloud layer, perhaps
because of polar downwelling and/or lower photochemical production rates. We did not find any evidence
for optically thick eyewalls that were previously thought to be responsible for the observed shadows.
Instead, we found evidence for small step-wise decreases in optical depth of the stratospheric
haze near 87.9 deg S and in the putative diphosphine layer near 88.9 deg S, which are the likely causes
of shadows and bright features we call antishadows. We found changes as a function of latitude in
the phosphine vertical profile and in the arsine mixing ratio that support the existence of downwelling
within 2 deg of the pole.
