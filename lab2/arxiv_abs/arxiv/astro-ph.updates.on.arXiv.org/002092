We conduct a joint X-ray and weak-lensing study of four relaxed galaxy clusters (Hydra A, A478, A1689
and A1835) observed by both Suzaku and Subaru out to virial radii, with an aim to understand recently-discovered
unexpected feature of the ICM in cluster outskirts. We show that the average hydrostatic-to-lensing
total mass ratio for the four clusters decreases from \sim 70% to \sim 40% as the overdensity contrast
decreases from 500 to the virial value.The average gas mass fraction from lensing total mass estimates
increases with cluster radius and agrees with the cosmic mean baryon fraction within the virial
radius, whereas the X-ray-based gas fraction considerably exceeds the cosmic values due to underestimation
of the hydrostatic mass. We also develop a new advanced method for determining normalized cluster
radial profiles for multiple X-ray observables by simultaneously taking into account both their
radial dependence and multivariate scaling relations with weak-lensing masses. Although the
four clusters span a range of halo mass, concentration, X-ray luminosity and redshift, we find that
the gas entropy, pressure, temperature and density profiles are all remarkably self-similar when
scaled with the lensing M_200 mass and r_200 radius.The entropy monotonically increases out to
\sim 0.5r_200 following the accretion shock heating model K(r)\propto r^1.1, and flattens at \simgt
0.5r_200.The universality of the scaled entropy profiles indicates that the thermalization mechanism
over the entire cluster region (>0.1r_200) is controlled by gravitation in a common to all clusters,
although the heating efficiency in the outskirts needs to be modified from the standard law.The
bivariate scaling functions of the gas density and temperature reveal that the flattening of the
outskirts entropy profile is caused by the steepening of the temperature, rather than the flattening
of the gas density.
