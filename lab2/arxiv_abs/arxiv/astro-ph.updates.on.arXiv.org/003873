We investigate the correlation between the frequencies of the twin kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations
(kHz QPOs) and the neutron star (NS) spins in low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), based on the data sets
of 12 sources with simultaneously detected twin kHz QPOs and NS spins, and find that the histogram
of the ratio between the frequency difference of twin kHz QPOs ({\Delta}{\nu} = {\nu}2 - {\nu}1)
and NS spin {\nu}s shows a non-uniform distribution with a gap at {\Delta}{\nu}/{\nu}s ~ 0.65. We
try to classify the 12 sources into two categories according to this gap: (I) The slow rotators with
<{\nu}s> ~ 311 Hz, XTE J1807.4-294, 4U 1915-05, IGR J17191-2821, 4U 1702-43, 4U 1728-34 and 4U 0614+09
follow a relation {\Delta}{\nu}/{\nu}s > 0.65; (II) The fast rotators with <{\nu}s> ~ 546 Hz, SAX
J1808.4-3658, KS 1731-260, Aql X-1, 4U 1636-53, SAX J1750.8-2900 and 4U 1608-52 satisfy the relation
{\Delta}{\nu}/{\nu}s < 0.65. However, the linear fittings of {\Delta}{\nu} versus {\nu}s relations
of group (I) and (II) are unsatisfactory to ensure any certain correlations. We suggest that this
phenomenon may arise from the fact that most measured kHz QPOs and spins satisfy the conditions of
1.1 {\nu}s < {\nu}2 < 1300Hz and {\Delta}{\nu} decreasing with {\nu}2. Apparently, the diversified
distribution of {\Delta}{\nu}/{\nu}s refutes the simple beat-frequency model, and the statistical
correlations between the twin kHz QPOs and NS spins may arise from the magnetosphere-disk boundary
environments, e.g., co-rotation radius and NS radius, that modulate the occurrences of X-ray signals.
Furthermore, we also find that the distribution of the ratio of {\nu}2 to {\nu}1 clusters around
the value of <{\nu}2/{\nu}1> ~ 3 : 2, which shows no obvious correlation with NS spins.
