We present a detailed investigation of the Rastall gravity extension of the standard---six-parameter
base---$\Lambda$CDM model. We review the model for two simultaneous modifications of different
nature in the Friedmann equation due to the Rastall gravity: the new contributions of the material
(actual) sources (considered as effective source) and the altered evolution of the material sources.
We discuss the role/behavior of these modifications with regard to some low redshift tensions,
including the $H_0$ tension, prevailing within the standard $\Lambda$CDM. We constrain the model
at the level of linear perturbations, and give the first constraints through a robust and accurate
analysis using the latest full Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, with and without
including baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data. We find that the Rastall parameter $\epsilon$
(null for general relativity) is consistent with zero at 68% CL (with a tendency towards negative
values, $-0.0014 < \epsilon < 0.0002$ (CMB+BAO) at 68% CL), which in turn implies no significant
statistical evidence for deviation from general relativity, and also a precision of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$
for the term $-\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R$ of the Einstein field equations of general relativity
(guaranteeing the local energy-momentum conservation law). We explore the consequences led by
the Rastall gravity on the cosmological parameters in the light of the observational analyses.
It turns out that the two simultaneous modifications of different nature in the Friedmann equation
act against each other, and consequently do not help to relax the so called low redshift tensions.
Our results may offer a guide for the research community that studies the Rastall gravity in various
aspects of gravitation and cosmology.
