We simulate a coronal mass ejection (CME) using a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
code that includes coronal heating, thermal conduction, and radiative cooling in the energy equation.
The magnetic flux distribution at 1 R$_s$ is produced by a localized subsurface dipole superimposed
on a global dipole field, mimicking the presence of an active region within the global corona. Transverse
electric fields are applied near the polarity inversion line to introduce a transverse magnetic
field, followed by the imposition of a converging flow to form and destabilize a flux rope, producing
an eruption. We examine the quantities responsible for plasma heating and cooling during the eruption,
including thermal conduction, radiation, adiabatic effects, coronal heating, and ohmic heating.
We find that ohmic heating is an important contributor to hot temperatures in the current sheet region
early in the eruption, but in the late phase adiabatic compression plays an important role in heating
the plasma there. Thermal conduction also plays an important role in the transport of thermal energy
away from the current sheet region throughout the reconnection process, producing a ``thermal
halo'' and widening the region of high temperatures. We simulate emission from solar telescopes
for this eruption and find that there is evidence for emission from heated plasma above the flare
loops late in the eruption, when the adiabatic heating is the dominant heating term. These results
provide an explanation for hot supra-arcade plasma sheets that are often observed in X-rays and
extreme ultraviolet wavelengths during the decay phase of large flares.
