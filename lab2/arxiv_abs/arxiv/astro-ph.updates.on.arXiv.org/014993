Any search for present or past life beyond Earth should consider the initial processes and related
environmental controls that might have led to its start. As on Earth, such an understanding lies
well beyond how simple organic molecules become the more complex biomolecules of life, because
it must also include the key environmental factors that permitted, modulated, and most critically
facilitated the prebiotic pathways to life's emergence. Moreover, we ask how habitability, defined
in part by the presence of liquid water, was sustained so that life could persist and evolve to the
point of shaping its own environment. Researchers have successfully explored many chapters of
Earth's coevolving environments and biosphere spanning the last few billion years through lenses
of sophisticated analytical and computational techniques, and the findings have profoundly impacted
the search for life beyond Earth. Yet life's very beginnings during the first hundreds of millions
of years of our planet's history remain largely unknown--despite decades of research. This report
centers on one key point: that the earliest steps on the path to life's emergence on Earth were tied
intimately to the evolving chemical and physical conditions of our earliest environments. Yet,
a rigorous, interdisciplinary understanding of that relationship has not been explored adequately
and once better understood will inform our search for life beyond Earth. In this way, studies of the
emergence of life must become a truly interdisciplinary effort, requiring a mix that expands the
traditional platform of prebiotic chemistry to include geochemists, atmospheric chemists, geologists
and geophysicists, astronomers, mission scientists and engineers, and astrobiologists.
