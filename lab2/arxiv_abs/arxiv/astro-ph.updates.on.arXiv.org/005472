Broad absorption lines (BALs) in the spectra of quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) originate from outflowing
winds along our line of sight; winds are thought to originate from the inner regions of the QSO accretion
disk, close to the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Winds likely play a role in galaxy evolution
and aid the accretion mechanism onto the SMBH. BAL equivalent widths can change on typical timescales
from months to years; such variability is generally attributed to changes in the covering factor
and/or in the ionization level of the gas. We investigate BAL variability, focusing on BAL disappearance.
We analyze multi-epoch spectra of more than 1500 QSOs -the largest sample ever used for such a study-
observed by different programs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-I/II/III (SDSS), and search for
disappearing C IV BALs. The spectra rest-frame time baseline ranges from 0.28 to 4.9 yr; the source
redshifts range from 1.68 to 4.27. We detect 73 disappearing BALs in the spectra of 67 sources. This
corresponds to 3.9% of disappearing BALs, and 5.1% of our BAL QSOs exhibit at least one disappearing
BAL. We estimate the average lifetime of a BAL along our line of sight (~ 80-100 yr), which appears
consistent with the accretion disk orbital time at distances where winds are thought to originate.
We inspect properties of the disappearing BALs and compare them to the properties of our main sample.
We also investigate the existence of a correlation in the variability of multiple troughs in the
same spectrum, and find it persistent at large velocity offsets between BAL pairs, suggesting that
a mechanism extending on a global scale is necessary to explain the phenomenon. We select a more reliable
sample of disappearing BALs following Filiz Ak et al. (2012), where a subset of our sample was analyzed,
and compare the findings from the two works, obtaining generally consistent results.
