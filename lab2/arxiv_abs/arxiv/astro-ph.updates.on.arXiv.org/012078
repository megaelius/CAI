We present deep rest-frame UV spectroscopic observations using the Gran Telescopio Canarias of
six gravitationally lensed Lya emitters (LAEs) at $2.36<z<2.82$ selected from the BELLS GALLERY
survey. By taking the magnifications into account, we show that LAEs can be as luminous as L(Lya)
= 30x10$^{42}$ erg s-1 and M(UV) = -23 (AB) without invoking an AGN component, in contrast with previous
findings. We measure Lya rest-frame equivalent widths, EW(Lya), ranging from 16\AA to 50\AA and
Lya escape fractions, fesc(Lya), from 10% to 40%. Large EW(Lya) and fesc(Lya) are found predominantly
in LAEs showing weak low-ionization ISM absorption (EW < 1\AA) and narrow Lya profiles (< 300 km s-1
FWHM) with their peak close (< 80 km s-1) to their systemic redshifts, suggestive of less scatter
from low HI column densities that favours the escape of Lya photons. We infer stellar metallicities
of Z/Zsun ~ 0.2 in almost all LAEs by comparing the P-Cygni profiles of the wind lines NV1240\AA and
CIV1549\AA with those from stellar synthesis models. We also find a trend between M(UV) and the velocity
offset of ISM absorption lines, such as the most luminous LAEs experience stronger outflows. The
most luminous LAEs show star formation rates up to 180 Msun yr-1, yet they appear relatively blue
($\beta$(UV) ~ -1.8 to -2.0) showing evidence of little dust attenuation (E(B-V) = 0.10-0.14).
These luminous LAEs may be particular cases of young starburst galaxies that have had no time to form
large amounts of dust. If so, they are ideal laboratories to study the early phase of massive star
formation, stellar and dust mass growth, and chemical enrichment histories of starburst galaxies
at high-z.
