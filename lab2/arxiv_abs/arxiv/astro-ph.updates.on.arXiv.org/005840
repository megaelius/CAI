Context. The presence of dust in the neutral interstellar medium (ISM) dramatically changes the
metal abundances that we measure. Understanding the metal content in the neutral ISM, and a direct
comparison between different environments, has been hampered to date because of the degeneracy
to the observed ISM abundances caused by the effects of metallicity, the presence of dust, and nucleosynthesis.
Aims. We study the metal and dust content in the neutral ISM consistently in different environments,
and assess the universality of recently discovered sequences of relative abundances. We also intend
to assess the validity of [Zn/Fe] as a tracer of dust in the ISM. This has recently been cast into doubt
based on observations of stellar abundances, and needs to be addressed before we can safely use it
to study the ISM. Methods. In this letter we present a simple comparison of relative abundances observed
in the neutral ISM in the Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds, and damped Lyman-{\alpha} Absorbers (DLAs).
The main novelty in this comparison is the inclusion of the Magellanic Clouds. Results. The same
sequences of relative abundances are valid for the Galaxy, Magellanic Clouds, and DLAs. These sequences
are driven by the presence of dust in the ISM and seem 'universal'. Conclusions. The metal and dust
properties in the neutral ISM appear to follow a similar behaviour in different environments. This
suggests that a dominant fraction of the dust budget is built up from grain growth in the ISM depending
of the physical conditions and regardless of the star formation history of the system. In addition,
the DLA gas behaves like the neutral ISM, at least from a chemical point of view. Finally, despite
the deviations in [Zn/Fe] observed in stellar abundances, [Zn/Fe] is a robust dust tracer in the
ISM of different environments, from the Galaxy to DLAs.
