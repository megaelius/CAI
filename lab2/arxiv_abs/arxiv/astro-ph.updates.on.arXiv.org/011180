The observed signatures of winds from X-ray binaries are broadly consistent with thermal winds,
driven by X-ray irradiation of the outer accretion disc. Thermal winds produce mass outflow rates
that can exceed the accretion rate in the disc. We study the impact of this mass loss on the stability
and lightcurves of X-ray binaries subject to the thermal-viscous instability, which drives their
outbursts. Strong mass loss could shut off outbursts early, as proposed for the 2015 outburst of
V404 Cyg. We use an analytical model for thermal (Compton) wind mass loss. Scattering in the strong
wind expected of long Porb systems enhances the irradiation heating of the outer disc, keeping it
stable against the thermal-viscous instability. This accounts very well for the existence of persistently
bright systems with large discs such as Cyg X-2, 1E 1740.7-2942, or GRS 1758-258. Wind mass loss shortens
the outburst, as expected, but insufficiently to explain the rapid decay timescale of black hole
X-ray binary outbursts. However, varying irradiation due to scattering in the wind produces lightcurves
with plateaus in long Porb systems like GRO J1655-40. Mass loss is not a major driver for the outburst
dynamics up to luminosities 0.1-0.2 L_Edd. Higher luminosities may produce stronger mass loss
but their study is complicated since the wind becomes opaque. Magnetic winds seem more promising
to explain the fast decay timescales generically seen in black hole X-ray binaries. Thermal winds
can play an important role in the outburst dynamics through the varying irradiation heating. This
may be evidenced by relating changes in wind properties, X-ray spectra or luminosity, with changes
in the optical emission that traces the outer disc. Simulations should enable more accurate estimates
of the dependence of the irradiation onto the disc as a function of irradiation spectrum, radius
and disc wind properties.
