We present a comprehensive multi-wavelength analysis of the merging galaxy cluster MACS~J0417.5-1154
at a redshift of $z=0.44$, using available images red obtained with \chandra\ in X-ray, {\it Subaru},
{\it Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) in optical, {\it Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope} (GMRT) in
radio and {\it Bolocam} at 2.1~mm wavelength. This is an example of a complex merging galaxy cluster
also hosting a steep-spectrum Mpc scale radio halo. The mass distribution obtained by weak lensing
reconstruction shows that MACS~J0417.5-1154 belongs to the dissociative class of mergers, where
one of its substructures has had its gas content detached after the pericentric passage. We find
the main cluster mass $M_{200}~=~11.5^{+3.0}_{-3.5} \times 10^{14}\ M_\odot$ and the smaller
second (sub)cluster mass to be $M_{200}~=~1.96^{+1.60}_{-0.95} \times 10^{14}\ M_\odot$, leading
to a large total mass of $M_{200}~=~13.8^{+2.6}_{-2.8} \times 10^{14}\ M_\odot$. The overall
structure, surface brightness profile, temperature and metal abundance of the intra-cluster
medium (ICM) all point towards the presence of a cold front and merger induced gas-sloshing motion
near the core. We detect a surface brightness edge to the south$-$east direction at a projected distance
of $\sim$45 arcsec ($\sim$255\,kpc) from the centre of this cluster. The X-ray spectral analysis
across the inner and outer edge allows us to confirm the detected edge as a cold front. The GMRT 235\,MHz
observation shows a comet$-$like extended sychrotron radio halo emission trailing behind the
cold front. The peak of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich decrement is found displaced from the centre of X-ray
emission, which is interpreted as consequence of the merger dynamics.
