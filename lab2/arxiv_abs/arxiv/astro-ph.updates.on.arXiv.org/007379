The strikingly anisotropic large-scale distribution of matter made of an extended network of voids
delimited by sheets, themselves segmented by filaments, within which matter flows towards compact
nodes where they intersect, imprints its geometry on the dynamics of cosmic flows, ultimately shaping
the distribution of galaxies and the redshift evolution of their properties. The (filament-type)
saddle points of this cosmic web provide a local frame in which to quantify the induced physical and
morphological evolution of galaxies on large scales. The properties of virtual galaxies within
the Horizon-AGN simulation are stacked in such a frame. The iso-contours of the galactic number
density, mass, specific star formation rate (sSFR), kinematics and age are clearly aligned with
the filament axis with steep gradients perpendicular to the filaments. A comparison to a simulation
without feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) illustrates its impact on quenching star formation
of centrals away from the saddles. The redshift evolution of the properties of galaxies and their
age distribution are consistent with the geometry of the bulk flow within that frame. They compare
well with expectations from constrained Gaussian random fields and the scaling with the mass of
non-linearity, modulo the redshift dependent impact of feedback processes. Physical properties
such as sSFR and kinematics seem not to depend only on mean halo mass and density: the residuals trace
the geometry of the saddle, which could point to other environment-sensitive physical processes,
such as spin advection, and AGN feedback at high mass.
