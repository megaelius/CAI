The Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope (HUT) was a 0.9 m telescope and moderate-resolution (~3 A) far-ultraviolet
(820-1850 A) spectrograph that flew twice on the space shuttle, in 1990 December (Astro-1, STS-35)
and 1995 March (Astro-2, STS-67). The resulting spectra were originally archived in a non-standard
format that lacked important descriptive metadata. To increase their utility, we have modified
the original data-reduction software to produce a new and more user-friendly data product, a time-tagged
photon list similar in format to the Intermediate Data Files (IDFs) produced by the {\it Far Ultraviolet
Spectroscopic Explorer} calibration pipeline. We have transferred all relevant pointing and
instrument-status information from locally-archived science and engineering databases into
new FITS header keywords for each data set. Using this new pipeline, we have reprocessed the entire
HUT archive from both missions, producing a new set of calibrated spectral products in a modern FITS
format that is fully compliant with Virtual Observatory requirements. For each exposure, we have
generated quick-look plots of the fully-calibrated spectrum and associated pointing history
information. Finally, we have retrieved from our archives HUT TV guider images, which provide information
on aperture positioning relative to guide stars, and converted them into FITS-format image files.
All of these new data products are available in the new HUT section of the Mikulski Archive for Space
Telescopes (MAST), along with historical and reference documents from both missions. In this paper,
we document the improved data-processing steps applied to the data and show examples of the new data
products.
