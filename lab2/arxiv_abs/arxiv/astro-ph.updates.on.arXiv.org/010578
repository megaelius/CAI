We study the Intra-Halo Stellar Component (IHSC) of Milky Way-mass systems up to galaxy clusters
in the Horizon-AGN cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. We identify the IHSC using an improved
phase-space galaxy finder algorithm which provides an adaptive, physically motivated and shape-independent
definition of this stellar component, that can be applied to halos of arbitrary masses. We explore
the IHSC mass fraction-total halo's stellar mass, $f_{M*,IHSC}-M*$, relation and the physical
drivers of its scatter. We find that on average the $f_{M*,IHSC}$ increases with $M_{*,tot}$, with
the scatter decreasing strongly with mass from 2 dex at $M_{*,tot}\sim10^{11}M_\odot$ to 0.3 dex
at group masses. At high masses, $M_{*,tot}>10^{11.5}M_\odot$, $f_{M*,IHSC}$ increases with
the number of substructures, and with the mass ratio between the central galaxy and largest satellite,
at fixed $M_{*,tot}$. From mid-size groups and systems below $M_{*,tot}<10^{12}M_\odot$, we
find that the central galaxy's stellar rotation-to-dispersion velocity ratio, V/{\sigma}, displays
the strongest (anti)-correlation with $f_{M*,IHSC}$ at fixed $M_{*,tot}$ of all the galaxy and
halo properties explored, transitioning from $f_{M*,IHSC}$<0.1% for high V/{\sigma}, to $f_{M*,IHSC}\sim5$%
for low V/{\sigma} galaxies. By studying the $f_{M*,IHSC}$ temporal evolution, we find that, in
the former, mergers not always take place, but if they did, they happened early (z>1), while the high
$f_{M*,IHSC}$ population displays a much more active merger history. In the case of massive groups
and galaxy clusters, $M_{*,tot}>10^{12}M_\odot$, a fraction $f_{M*,IHSC}\sim$10-20% is reached
at $z\sim1$ and then they evolve across lines of constant $f_{M*,IHSC}$ modulo some small perturbations.
Because of the limited simulation's volume, the latter is only tentative and requires a larger sample
of simulated galaxy clusters to confirm.
