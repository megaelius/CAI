Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are high luminosity sources powered by accretion of matter onto SMBHs
located at the centres of galaxies. The SMBH is surrounded by a broad emission line region (BLR) and
a dusty torus. It is difficult to study the extent of the dusty torus as the central region of AGN is
not resolvable using any conventional imaging techniques available today. Though, current IR
interferometric techniques could in principle resolve the torus in nearby AGN, it is very expensive
and limited to few bright and nearby AGN. A more feasible alternative to the interferometric technique
to find the extent of the dusty torus in AGN is the technique of reverberation mapping (RM). REMAP
(REverberation Mapping of AGN Program) is a long term photometric monitoring program being carried
out using the 2 m HCT operated by the IIA, Bangalore, aimed at measuring the torus size in many AGN using
the technique of RM. It involves accumulation of suitably long and well sampled light curves in the
optical and near-infrared bands to measure the time delays between the light curves in different
wavebands. These delays are used to determine the radius of the inner edge of the dust torus. REMAP
was initiated in the year 2016 and since then about one hour of observing time once every five days
(weather permitting) has been allocated at the HCT. Our initial sample carefully selected for this
program consists of a total of 8 sources observable using the HCT. REMAP has resulted in the determination
of the extent of the inner edge of the dusty torus in one AGN namely H0507+164. Data accumulation for
the second source is completed and observations on the third source are going on. We will outline
the motivation of this observational program, the observational strategy that is followed, the
analysis procedures adopted for this work and the results obtained from this program till now.
