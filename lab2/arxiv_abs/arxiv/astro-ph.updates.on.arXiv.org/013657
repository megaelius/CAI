The quiescent emission of the anomalous X-ray pulsar (AXP) 4U 0142+61 extends over a broad range
of energy, from radio up to hard X-rays. In particular, this object is unique among soft gamma-ray
repeaters (SGRs) and AXPs in presenting simultaneously mid-infrared emission and pulsed optical
emission. In spite of the many propositions to explain this wide range of emission, it still lacks
one that reproduces all the observations. Filling this gap, we present a model to reproduce the quiescent
spectral energy distribution of 4U 0142+61 from mid-infrared up to hard X-rays using plausible
physical components and parameters. We propose that the persistent emission comes from a magnetic
accreting white dwarf (WD) surrounded by a debris disk. This model assumes that: (i) the hard X-rays
are due to the bremsstrahlung emission from the post-shock region of the accretion column; (ii)
the soft X-rays are originated by hot spots on the WD surface; and (iii) the optical and infrared emissions
are caused by an optically thick dusty disk, the WD photosphere, and the tail of the postshock region
emission. In this scenario, the fitted model parameters indicate that 4U 0142+61 harbors a fast-rotator
magnetic near-Chandrasekhar WD, which is very hot and hence young. Such a WD can be the recent outcome
of a merger of two less massive WDs. In this case, 4U 0142+61 can evolve to an SN Ia and hence can give
hints of the origin of these important astrophysical events. Additionally, we also present a new
estimate of 4U 0142+61 distance, 3.78 (errors: +0.12 / -0.18 kpc), based on the measured Hydrogen
column density and new interstellar extinction 3D maps.
