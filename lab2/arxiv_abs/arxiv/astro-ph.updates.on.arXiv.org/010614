Recent interferometric observations have shown bright HCN emission from the nu2=1 vibrational
state arising in buried nuclear regions of galaxies, indicating an efficient pumping of the nu2=1
state through absorption of 14 $\mu$m continuum photons. We have modeled the continuum and HCN vibrational
line emission in these regions, characterized by high column densities of dust and high luminosities,
with a spherically symmetric approach, simulating both a central heating source (AGN) and a compact
nuclear starburst (SB). We find that when the H2 columns become very high, N_{H2}>~10^{25} cm-2,
trapping of continuum photons within the nuclear region dramatically enhances the dust temperature
(Tdust) in the inner regions, even though the predicted spectral energy distribution as seen from
outside becomes relatively cold. The models thus predict bright continuum at millimeter wavelengths
for luminosity surface brightness (averaged over the model source) of ~10^{8} Lsun pc^{-2}. This
{\it greenhouse} effect significantly enhances the mean mid-infrared intensity within the dusty
volume, populating the nu2=1 state to the extent that the HCN vibrational lines become optically
thick. AGN models yield higher Tdust in the inner regions and higher peak (sub)millimeter continuum
brightness than SB models, but similar HCN vibrational J=3-2 and 4-3 emission owing to both optical
depth effects and a moderate impact of high \tdust\ on these low-J lines. The observed HCN vibrational
emission in several galaxies can be accounted for with a HCN abundance of ~10^{-6} (relative to H2)
and luminosity surface brightness in the range (0.5-2)x10^{8}$ Lsun pc^{-2}, predicting a far-infrared
photosphere with Tdust}~80-150 K --in agreement with the values inferred from far-infrared molecular
absorption.
