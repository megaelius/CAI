While loop quantum cosmology (LQC) predicts a robust quantum bounce of the background evolution
of a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) spacetime prior to the standard slow-roll inflation, whereby
the big bang singularity is resolved, there are several different quantization procedures to cosmological
perturbations, for instance, {\em the deformed algebra, dressed metric, and hybrid quantizations}.
This paper devotes to study the quantum bounce effects of primordial perturbations in the hybrid
approach. The main discrepancy of this approach is the effective positive mass at the quantum bounce
for the evolution of the background that is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton field
at the bounce, while this mass is always nonpositive in the dressed metric approach. It is this positivity
of the effective mass that violates the adiabatic evolution of primordial perturbations at the
initial moments of the quantum bounce. With the assumption that the evolution of the background
is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton at the bounce, we find that the effective potentials
for both scalar and tensor perturbations can be well approximately described by a P\"{o}schl-Teller
(PT) potential, which allows us to find analytical solutions of perturbations, and from these analytical
expressions we are able to study the non-adiabatic evolution of primordial perturbations in details.
In particular, we derive their quantum bounce effects and investigate their observational constraints.
In addition, the impacts of quantum bounce effects on the non-Gaussinity and their implication
on the explanations of observed power asymmetry in CMB have also been explored.
