Interstellar neutral atoms provide a remote diagnostic of plasma in the outer heliosheath and the
very local interstellar medium via charge exchange collisions that convert ions into atoms and
vice versa. So far, most studies of interstellar atoms assumed that daughter hydrogen atoms directly
inherit the kinetic properties of parent protons. This assumption neglects angular scattering
of the interacting particles. However, for low relative velocities, as expected for charge exchanges
in the outer heliosheath, this scattering is significant. In this study, we present how the parameters
of daughter populations depend on the relative velocity and temperatures of parent populations.
For this purpose, we numerically compute collision terms with and without this scattering. We find
that the secondary population of interstellar hydrogen atoms, for the parent populations with
the relative bulk velocity of 20 km s$^{-1}$ and equal temperatures of 7500 K, has ~2 km s$^{-1}$ higher
bulk velocity if the scattering is taken into account. Additionally, temperatures are higher by
~2400 K and ~1200 K in parallel and perpendicular direction to the relative motion of parent populations,
respectively. Moreover, a significant departure of secondary atoms from the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution is expected for high relative velocities of parent populations. This process affects
the distribution and density of interstellar atoms in the heliosphere and production of pickup
ions. Thus, we show that angular scattering in charge exchange collisions is important to include
in analyses of interstellar neutral atoms and pickup ions observed at 1 au and in the outer heliosphere.
