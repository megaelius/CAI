Our present-day atmosphere is often used as an analog for potentially habitable exoplanets, but
Earth's atmosphere has changed dramatically throughout its 4.5 billion year history. For example,
molecular oxygen is abundant in the atmosphere today but was absent on the early Earth. Meanwhile,
the physical and chemical evolution of Earth's atmosphere has also resulted in major swings in surface
temperature, at times resulting in extreme glaciation or warm greenhouse climates. Despite this
dynamic and occasionally dramatic history, the Earth has been persistently habitable--and, in
fact, inhabited--for roughly 4 billion years. Understanding Earth's momentous changes and its
enduring habitability is essential as a guide to the diversity of habitable planetary environments
that may exist beyond our solar system and for ultimately recognizing spectroscopic fingerprints
of life elsewhere in the Universe. Here, we review long-term trends in the composition of Earth's
atmosphere as it relates to both planetary habitability and inhabitation. We focus on gases that
may serve as habitability markers (CO2, N2) or biosignatures (CH4, O2), especially as related to
the redox evolution of the atmosphere and the coupled evolution of Earth's climate system. We emphasize
that in the search for Earth-like planets we must be mindful that the example provided by the modern
atmosphere merely represents a single snapshot of Earth's long-term evolution. In exploring the
many former states of our own planet, we emphasize Earth's atmospheric evolution during the Archean,
Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic eons, but we conclude with a brief discussion of potential atmospheric
trajectories into the distant future, many millions to billions of years from now. All of these 'Alternative
Earth' scenarios provide insight to the potential diversity of Earth-like, habitable, and inhabited
worlds.
