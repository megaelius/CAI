Type-III S0 galaxies present tight scaling relations between their surface brightness photometric
and structural parameters. Several evolutionary models have been proposed for the formation of
Type-III S0 galaxies but the observations of are usually limited to the local Universe. We study
the evolution of the photometric and structural scaling relations found between the parameters
of the surface brightness profiles in the rest-frame R-band of Type-III S0 galaxies with z and the
possible differences between the rest-frame (B-R) colours of the inner and outer disc profiles.
We make use of a sample of 14 Type-III E/S0--S0 galaxies at 0.2<z<0.6 to study if the correlations
found in local Type-III S0 galaxies were present ~6 Gyr ago. We analyse the distribution of the surface
brightness characteristic parameters as a function of the stellar mass and if there is a significant
change with z. We also derive their rest-frame (B-R) colour profiles and we compare these results
with the predictions from a grid of SSP models. We find that the inner and outer scale-lengths of Type-III
S0 galaxies at 0.4<z<0.6 follow compatible trends and scaling relations with those observed in
local S0 galaxies. We do not detect any significant differences between the location of Rbreak between
z~0.6 and z=0 for a fixed stellar mass of the object, whereas the surface brightness at the break radius
is ~1.5 mag arcsec-2 dimmer in the local Universe than at z~0.6 for a fixed stellar mass. In contrast
to Type-II profiles, the Type-III surface brightness profiles of S0 galaxies present compatible
Rbreak values and scaling relations during the last 6 Gyr. This result and the similarity of the colours
of the inner and outer discs point to a highly scalable and stable formation process, probably more
related to gravitational and dynamical processes than to the evolution of stellar populations
(abridged).
