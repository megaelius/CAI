Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) represent the most prominent population of Galactic very-high-energy
gamma-ray sources and are thought to be an efficient source of leptonic cosmic rays. Vela X is a nearby
middle-aged PWN, which shows bright X-ray and TeV gamma-ray emission toward an elongated structure
called the cocoon. Since TeV emission is likely inverse-Compton emission of electrons while X-ray
emission is synchrotron radiation of the same electrons, we aim to derive the properties of the relativistic
particles and of magnetic fields with minimal modelling. We use data from the Suzaku XIS to derive
the spectra from three compact regions in Vela X covering distances from 0.3 pc to 4 pc from the pulsar
along the cocoon. We obtain gamma-ray spectra of the same regions from H.E.S.S. observations and
fit a radiative model to the multi-wavelength spectra. The TeV electron spectra and magnetic field
strengths are consistent within the uncertainties for the three regions, with energy densities
of the order $10^{-12}\rm\,erg\,cm^{-3}$. The data indicate the presence of a cutoff in the electron
spectrum at energies of $\sim$100 TeV and a magnetic field strength of $\sim$$6\,\rm\mu G$. Constraints
on the presence of turbulent magnetic fields are weak. The pressure of TeV electrons and magnetic
fields in the cocoon is dynamically negligible, requiring the presence of another dominant pressure
component. Sub-TeV electrons cannot account completely for the missing pressure, that may be provided
either by relativistic ions or from mixing of the ejecta with the pulsar wind. The electron spectra
are consistent with expectations from transport scenarios dominated either by advection via the
reverse shock or by diffusion. Constraints on turbulent magnetic fields and the shape of the electron
cutoff can be improved by spectral measurements in the energy range $\gtrsim 10\rm\,keV$. (abridged)
