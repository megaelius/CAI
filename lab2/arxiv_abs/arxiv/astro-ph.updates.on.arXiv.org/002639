Nucleon self-energies and interaction potentials in supernova (SN) matter are investigated,
that are known to have an important effect on nucleosynthesis conditions in SN ejecta. Corresponding
weak charged-current interaction rates are derived that are consistent with SN equations of state
(EOS) which are already being used in astrophysical simulations. The nucleon self-energies are
made available online as electronic tables. The discussion is mostly restricted to relativistic
mean-field models. In the first part of the article, the generic properties of this class of models
at finite temperature and asymmetry are studied. It is found that the quadratic expansion of the
EOS in terms of asymmetry also works well at finite temperature and that the interaction part of the
symmetry energy is almost temperature independent. At low densities, the account of realistic
nucleon masses requires the introduction of a linear term in the expansion. Finally, it is shown
that the neutron-to-proton potential difference is given approximately by the asymmetry of the
system and the interaction part of the zero-temperature symmetry energy. The results of different
interactions are then compared with constraints from nuclear experiments and thereby the possible
range of the potential difference is limited. In the second part, for a certain class of SN EOS models,
the formation of nuclei is considered. Only moderate modifications are found for the weak interaction
rates of neutrinos with unbound nucleons because in the present approach the binding energies of
bound states do not contribute to the single-particle energies of unbound nucleons.
