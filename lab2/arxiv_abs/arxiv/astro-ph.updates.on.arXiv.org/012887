Context: In sunspots, the geometric height of continuum optical depth unity is depressed compared
to the quiet Sun. This so-called Wilson depression is caused by the Lorentz force of the strong magnetic
field inside the spots. However, it is not understood in detail yet, how the Wilson depression is
related to the strength and geometry of the magnetic field or to other properties of the sunspot.
Aims: We aim to study the dependence of the Wilson depression on the properties of the magnetic field
of the sunspots and how exactly the magnetic field contributes to balancing the Wilson depression
with respect to the gas pressure of the surroundings of the spots. Methods: Our study is based on 24
spectropolarimetric scans of 12 individual sunspots performed with Hinode. We derived the Wilson
depression for each spot using both, a recently developed method that is based on minimizing the
divergence of the magnetic field, and an approach developed earlier that enforces an equilibrium
between the gas pressure and the magnetic pressure inside the spot and the gas pressure in the quiet
Sun, thus neglecting the influence of the curvature force. We then performed a statistical analysis
by comparing the Wilson depression resulting from the two techniques with each other and by relating
them to various parameters of the sunspots, such as their size or the strength of the magnetic field.
Results: We find that the Wilson depression becomes larger for spots with a stronger magnetic field,
but not as much as one would expect from the increased magnetic pressure. This suggests that the curvature
integral provides an important contribution to the Wilson depression, particularly for spots
with a weak magnetic field. Our results indicate that the geometry of the magnetic field in the penumbra
is different between spots with different strengths of the average umbral magnetic field.
