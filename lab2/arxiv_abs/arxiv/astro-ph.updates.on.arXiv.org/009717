We use the Equation of State (EoS) approach to study the evolution of the dark sector in Horndeski
models, the most general scalar-tensor theories with second order equations of motion. By including
the effects of the dark sector into our code EoS\_class, we demonstrate the numerical stability
of the formalism and excellent agreement with results from other publicly available codes for a
range of parameters describing the evolution of the function characterising the perturbations
for Horndeski models, $\alpha_{\rm x}$, with ${\rm x}=\{{\rm K}, {\rm B}, {\rm M}, {\rm T}\}$. After
demonstrating that on sub-horizon scales ($k\gtrsim 10^{-3}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z=0$) velocity
perturbations in both the matter and the dark sector are typically subdominant with respect to density
perturbations in the equation of state for perturbations, we find an attractor solution for the
dark sector gauge-invariant density perturbation $\Delta_{\rm ds}$. Using this result, we provide
simplified expressions for the equation-of-state functions: the dark sector entropy perturbations
$w_{\rm ds}\Gamma_{\rm ds}$ and anisotropic stress $w_{\rm ds}\Pi_{\rm ds}$. From this we derive
a growth factor-like equation for both matter and dark sector and are able to capture the relevant
physics for several observables with great accuracy. We finally present new analytical expressions
for the well-known modified gravity phenomenological functions $\mu$, $\eta$ and $\Sigma$ for
a generic Horndeski model as functions of $\alpha_{\rm x}$. We show that on small scales they reproduce
expressions presented in previous works, but on large scales, we find differences with respect
to other works.
