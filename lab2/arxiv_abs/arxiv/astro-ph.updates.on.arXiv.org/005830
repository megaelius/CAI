As the closest Type Ia supernova in decades, SN 2014J provides a unique opportunity for detailed
investigation into observational signatures of the progenitor system and explosion mechanism
in addition to burning product distribution. We present a late-time near-infrared spectral series
from Gemini-N at $307-466$ days after the explosion. Following the $H$-band evolution probes the
distribution of radioactive iron group elements, the extent of mixing, and presence of magnetic
fields in the expanding ejecta. Comparing the isolated $1.6440$ $\mu$m [Fe II] emission line with
synthetic models shows consistency with a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf of $\rho_c=0.7\times10^9$
g cm${}^{-3}$ undergoing a delayed detonation. The ratio of the flux in the neighboring $1.54$ $\mu$m
emission feature to the flux in the $1.6440$ $\mu$m feature shows evidence of some limited mixing
of stable and radioactive iron group elements in the central regions. Additionally, the evolution
of the $1.6440$ $\mu$m line shows an intriguing asymmetry. When measuring line-width of this feature,
the data show an increase in line width not seen in the evolution of the synthetic spectra, corresponding
to $\approx1{,}000$ km s${}^{-1}$, which could be caused by a localized transition to detonation
producing asymmetric ionization in the ejecta. Using the difference in width between the different
epochs, an asymmetric component in the central regions, corresponding to approximately the inner
$2\times10^{-4}$ of white dwarf mass suggests an off-center ignition of the initial explosion
and hence of the kinematic center from the chemical center. Several additional models investigated,
including a He detonation and a merger, have difficulty reproducing the features seen these spectra.
