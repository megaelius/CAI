The hosts of long duration gamma-ray bursts are predominantly starburst galaxies at subsolar metallicity.
At redshifts z<1, this implies that most of them are low-mass dwarf galaxies similar to the populations
of blue compact dwarfs and dwarf irregulars. What triggers the massive star-formation needed for
producing a GRB progenitor is still largely unknown, as are the resolved gas properties and kinematics
of these galaxies and their formation history. Here we present a sample of six spatially resolved
GRB hosts at z<0.3 observed with 3D spectroscopy at high spectral resolution (R=8,000-13,000)
using FLAMES/VLT. We analyze the resolved gas kinematics in the full and the abundances in a subsample.
Only two galaxies show a regular disk-like rotation field, two are dispersion dominated and the
others have several narrow emission components associated with different parts of the galaxy,
which might indicate recent mergers. All galaxies show evidence for broad components underlying
the main narrow emission with FWHM of 150-300 km/s. This broad component is more metal rich than the
narrow components, blueshifted and follows a different velocity structure. We find a weak correlation
between the star-formation rate and the FHWM of the broad component, its flux relative to the narrow
component and the maximum outflow velocity of the gas, but we not find any correlation with the star-formation
density, metallicity or stellar mass. We associate this broad component with a metal rich outflow
from star-forming regions in the host. The GRB is not found at the brightest or most extreme region
of the host but is always associated with a star-forming region showing a clear wind component. Our
study shows the great potential of 3D spectroscopy to study the star-formation processes in galaxies
hosting extreme transients, the need for high S/N and the dangers using un- or only partially resolved
data.
