We reconstruct in this paper the deceleration and jerk parameters as functions of the cosmological
redshift from data on cosmic chronometers (CCH), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), and the
Pantheon+MCT compilation of supernovae of Type Ia (SnIa). The reconstruction is carried out with
the Weighted Function Regression method, previously introduced by G\'omez-Valent & Amendola
(2018). It improves the usual cosmographic approach by automatically implementing Occam's razor
criterion. This makes our procedure to be more free of model and parametrization dependencies than
many other analyses in the literature. The reconstructed functions are fully compatible with the
predictions for the concordance model. In addition, we also discuss the confidence level at which
we can claim that the Universe (assumed to be flat, homogeneous and isotropic) is currently accelerating.
According to Jeffreys' scale and jargon, we find moderate evidence in favor of such speed-up using
the data on SnIa+CCH, and very strong one when we also use data on BAOs. The measured current value
of the deceleration parameter in the latter case reads $q_0\sim -0.60\pm 0.10$, and for the deceleration-acceleration
transition redshift we find $z_t\sim 0.8\pm 0.10$. The former is $\sim 6\sigma$ away from $0$. This
is in stark contrast, for instance, with the $\sim 17\sigma$ that are found in the context of the flat
$\Lambda$CDM even without including the BAOs data. This indicates that cosmography and Occam's
razor criterion play a crucial role in this discussion, and that estimating the evidence for positive
acceleration only in the framework of a particular cosmological model or parametrization is clearly
insufficient.
