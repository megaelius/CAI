We investigate the vorticity-preserving properties of the compressible, second-order residual-based
scheme, "RBV2". The scheme has been extensively tested on hydrodynamical problems, and has been
shown to exhibit remarkably accurate results on the propagation of inviscid compressible vortices,
airfoil-vortex interactions on a curvilinear mesh, vortex mergers in an astrophysical accretion
disk, and the establishment of a two-dimensional inverse cascade in high-resolution turbulent
simulations. Here, we demonstrate that RBV2 sustains the analytic solution for a one-dimensional
shear flow. We assess the fidelity by which the algorithm maintains a skewed shear flow, and present
convergence tests to quantify the magnitude of the expected numerical dispersion. We propose an
adjustment to the dissipation in the algorithm that retains the vorticity-preserving qualities,
and accurately incorporates external body forces, and demonstrate that it indefinitely maintains
a steady-state hydrostatic equilibrium between a generic acceleration and a density gradient.
We present a novel numerical assessment of vorticity preservation for discrete-wavenumber vortical
modes up to the Nyquist wavenumber. We apply this assessment to RBV2 in order to quantify the extent
to which the scheme preserves vorticity for the full Euler equations. We find that RBV2 perfectly
preserves vorticity for modes with symmetric wavenumbers, i.e., $k_x=k_y$, and that the error
increases with asymmetry. We simulate the dynamical interaction of vortices in a protoplanetary
disk to demonstrate the utility of the updated scheme for rendering astrophysical flows replete
with vortices and turbulence. We conclude that RBV2 is a competitive treatment for evolving vorticity-dominated
astrophysical flows with minimal dissipation.
