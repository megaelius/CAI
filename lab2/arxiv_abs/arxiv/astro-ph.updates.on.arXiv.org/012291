We present a joint analysis of rest-UV and rest-optical spectra obtained using Keck/LRIS and Keck/MOSFIRE
for a sample of 62 star-forming galaxies at $z\sim2.3$. We divide our sample into 2 bins based on their
location in the [OIII]/Hb vs. [NII]/Ha BPT diagram, and perform the first differential study of
the rest-UV properties of massive ionizing stars as a function of rest-optical emission-line ratios.
Fitting BPASS stellar population synthesis models, including nebular continuum emission, to
our rest-UV spectra, we find that high-redshift galaxies offset towards higher [OIII]/Hb and [NII]/Ha
have younger ages (log(Age/yr)=$7.20^{+0.57}_{-0.20}$) and lower stellar metallicities ($Z_*=0.0010^{+0.0011}_{-0.0003}$)
resulting in a harder ionizing spectrum, compared to the galaxies in our sample that lie on the local
BPT star-forming sequence (log(Age/yr)=$8.57^{+0.88}_{-0.84}$, $Z_*=0.0019\pm0.0006$).
Additionally, we find that the offset galaxies have an ionization parameter of log(U)=$-3.04^{+0.06}_{-0.11}$
and nebular metallicity of 12+log(O/H)=$8.40^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$, and the non-offset galaxies
have log(U)=$-3.11\pm0.08$ and 12+log(O/H)=$8.30^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$. The stellar and nebular
metallicities derived for our sample imply that the galaxies offset from the local BPT relation
are more alpha-enhanced ($7.28^{+2.52}_{-2.82}$ O/Fe$_\odot$) compared to those consistent
with the local sequence ($3.04^{+0.95}_{-0.54}$ O/Fe$_\odot$). However, even galaxies that
are entirely consistent with the local nebular excitation sequence appear to be alpha-enhanced
-- in contrast with typical local systems. Such differences must be considered when estimating
gas-phase O/H at high redshift based on strong emission-line ratios. Specifically, a similarity
in the location of high-redshift and local galaxies in the BPT diagram may not be indicative of a similarity
in their physical properties.
