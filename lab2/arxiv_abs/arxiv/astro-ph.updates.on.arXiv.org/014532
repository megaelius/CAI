This paper identifies constraints on the growth of a small planetary core (0.3 M$_{\oplus}$) that
accretes millimeter-sized pebbles from a gaseous disk. We construct time-dependent spherical
envelope models that capture physical processes not included in existing global hydrodynamic
simulations, including particle size evolution, dust transport, and realistic gas equations
of state. We assume a low enough disk density that pebbles are marginally coupled to the gas and are
trapped efficiently near the core Bondi radius. Pebbles then drift rapidly enough to experience
erosion by sandblasting, mutual collisions, and sublimation of water ice. We find that pebble fragmentation
is more efficient than dust re-sticking. Therefore the large pebble accretion rate $\dot{M}_p$
needed to build a core of mass > M$_{\oplus}$ leads to a high envelope metallicity and grain opacity.
Above $\dot{M}_p$ $\sim 10^{-7}$ M$_{\oplus}$/yr, and without other luminosity sources, convective
motions expand near the Bondi radius. The warm, dusty, and turbulent envelope buffers the inward
drift of pebble debris: given a turbulent concentration factor $f_{turb} \geq$ 1 near the lower
convective boundary, the core growth rate is limited to $1 \times 10^{-7} f_{turb}$ M$_{\oplus}$/yr
and the e-folding time 3$f_{turb}^{-1}$ Myr. The remainder of the solid debris is expelled as highly
processed silicates. Pebble ice never reaches the core, and the envelope contains comparable amounts
of H2/He and metals. We interpret our results using simpler steady models and semi-analytical estimates.
Future global simulations incorporating the processes modelled here are needed to understand
the influence of rotation and vertical disk structure.
