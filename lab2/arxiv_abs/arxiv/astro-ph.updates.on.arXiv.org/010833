We analyse the accuracy of radio interferometric gridding of visibilities with the aim to quantify
the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) 21-cm power spectrum bias caused by gridding, ultimately to determine
the suitability of different imaging algorithms and gridding settings for 21-cm power spectrum
analysis. We simulate realistic LOFAR data, and construct power spectra with convolutional gridding
and w-stacking, w-projection, image domain gridding and without w-correction. These are compared
against directly Fourier transformed data. The influence of oversampling, kernel size, w-quantization,
kernel windowing function and image padding are quantified. The gridding excess power is measured
with a foreground subtraction strategy, for which foregrounds have been subtracted using Gaussian
progress regression, as well as with a foreground avoidance strategy. Constructing a power spectrum
that has a bias significantly lower compared to the expected EoR signals is possible with the tested
methods, but requires a kernel oversampling factor > 4000 and, when using w-correction, > 500 w-quantization
levels. These values are higher than typical values used for imaging, but are computationally feasible.
The kernel size and padding factor parameters are less crucial. Among the tested methods, image
domain gridding shows the highest accuracy with the lowest imaging time. LOFAR 21-cm power spectrum
results are not affected by gridding. Image domain gridding is overall the most suitable algorithm
for 21-cm EoR experiments, including for future SKA EoR analyses. Nevertheless, convolutional
gridding with tuned parameters results in sufficient accuracy. This holds also for w-stacking
for wide-field imaging. The w-projection algorithm is less suitable because of the kernel oversampling
requirements, and a faceting approach is unsuitable due to the resulting spatial discontinuities.
