In the study of planetary habitability and terrestrial atmospheric evolution, the divergence
of surface conditions for Venus and Earth remains an area of active research. Among the intrinsic
and external influences on the Venusian climate history are orbital changes due to giant planet
migration that have both variable incident flux and tidal heating consequences. Here, we present
the results of a study that explores the effect of Jupiter's location on the orbital parameters of
Venus and subsequent potential water loss scenarios. Our dynamical simulations show that various
scenarios of Jovian migration could have resulted in orbital eccentricities for Venus as high as
0.31. We quantify the implications of the increased eccentricity, including tidal energy, surface
energy flux, and the variable insolation flux expected from the faint young Sun. The tidal circularization
timescale calculations demonstrate that a relatively high tidal dissipation factor is required
to reduce the eccentricity of Venus to the present value, which implies a high initial water inventory.
We further estimate the consequences of high orbital eccentricity on water loss, and estimate that
the water loss rate may have increased by at least $\sim$5\% compared with the circular orbit case
as a result of orbital forcing. We argue that these eccentricity variations for the young Venus may
have accelerated the atmospheric evolution of Venus towards the inevitable collapse of the atmosphere
into a runaway greenhouse state. The presence of giant planets in exoplanetary systems may likewise
increase the expected rate of Venus analogs in those systems.
