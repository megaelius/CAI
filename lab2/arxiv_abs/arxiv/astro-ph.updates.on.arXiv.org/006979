We present high-resolution of spectroscopy of four stars in two candidate ultra-faint dwarf galaxies
(UFDs) Grus I (Gru I) and Triangulum II (Tri II). Neither object currently has a clearly determined
velocity dispersion, placing them in an ambiguous region of parameter space between dwarf galaxies
and globular clusters. No significant metallicity difference is found for the two Gru I stars, but
both stars are deficient in neutron-capture elements. We verify previous results that Tri II displays
significant spreads in metallicity and [$\alpha$/Fe]. Neutron-capture elements are not detected
in our Tri II data, but we place upper limits at the lower envelope of Galactic halo stars, consistent
with previous very low detections. Stars with similarly low neutron-capture element abundances
are common in UFDs, but rare in other environments. This signature of low neutron-capture element
abundances traces chemical enrichment in the least massive star-forming dark matter halos, and
further shows that the dominant sources of neutron-capture elements in metal-poor stars are rare.
In contrast, all known globular clusters have similar ratios of neutron-capture elements to those
of halo stars, suggesting that globular clusters form as part of relatively massive galaxies rather
than in their own dark matter halos. The low neutron-capture element abundances may be the strongest
evidence that Gru I and Tri II are (or once were) galaxies rather than globular clusters, and we expect
future observations of these systems to robustly find non-zero velocity dispersions or signs of
tidal disruption. However, the nucleosynthetic origin of this low neutron-capture element floor
remains unknown.
