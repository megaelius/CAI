The LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) is a sensitive, high-resolution 120-168 MHz survey of the
Northern sky. The LoTSS First Data Release (DR1) presents 424 square degrees of radio continuum
observations over the HETDEX Spring Field (10h45m00s $<$ right ascension $<$ 15h30m00s and 45$^\circ$00$'$00$'$
$<$ declination $<$ 57$^\circ$00$'$00$''$) with a median sensitivity of 71$\mu$Jy/beam and a
resolution of 6$''$. In this paper we present photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) for 94.4% of optical
sources over this region that are detected in the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response
System (Pan-STARRS) 3$\pi$ steradian survey. Combining the Pan-STARRS optical data with mid-infrared
photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, we estimate photo-$z$s using a novel
hybrid photometric redshift methodology optimised to produce the best possible performance for
the diverse sample of radio continuum selected sources. For the radio-continuum detected population,
we find an overall scatter in the photo-$z$ of 3.9% and an outlier fraction ($\left | z_{\rm{phot}}
- z_{\rm{spec}} \right | / (1+z_{\rm{spec}}) > 0.15$) of 7.9%. We also find that, at a given redshift,
there is no strong trend in photo-$z$ quality as a function of radio luminosity. However there are
strong trends as a function of redshift for a given radio luminosity, a result of selection effects
in the spectroscopic sample and/or intrinsic evolution within the radio source population. Additionally,
for the sample of sources in the LoTSS First Data Release with optical counterparts, we present rest-frame
optical and mid-infrared magnitudes based on template fits to the consensus photometric (or spectroscopic
when available) redshift.
