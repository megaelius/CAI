We describe scalar-bimetric theories where the dynamics of the Universe are governed by two separate
metrics, each with an Einstein-Hilbert term. In this setting, the baryonic and dark matter components
of the Universe couple to metrics which are constructed as functions of these two gravitational
metrics. The scalar field, contrary to dark energy models, does not have a potential whose role is
to mimic a late-time cosmological constant. The late-time acceleration of the expansion of the
Universe can be easily obtained at the background level in these models by appropriately choosing
the coupling functions appearing in the decomposition of the vierbeins for the baryonic and dark
matter metrics. We explicitly show how the concordance model can be retrieved with negligible scalar
kinetic energy. This requires the scalar coupling functions to show variations of order unity during
the accelerated expansion era. This leads in turn to deviations of order unity for the effective
Newton constants and a fifth force that is of the same order as Newtonian gravity, with peculiar features.
The baryonic and dark matter self-gravities are amplified although the gravitational force between
baryons and dark matter is reduced and even becomes repulsive at low redshift. This slows down the
growth of baryonic density perturbations on cosmological scales, while dark matter perturbations
are enhanced. In our local environment, the upper bound on the time evolution of Newton's constant
requires an efficient screening mechanism that both damps the fifth force on small scales and decouples
the local value of Newton constant from its cosmological value. This cannot be achieved by a quasi-static
chameleon mechanism, and requires going beyond the quasi-static regime and probably using derivative
screenings, such as Kmouflage or Vainshtein screening, on small scales.
