We present a linear stability analysis of the fast-pairwise neutrino flavor conversion based on
a result of our latest axisymmetric core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulation with full Boltzmann
neutrino transport. In the CCSN simulation, coherent asymmetric neutrino emissions of electron-type
neutrinos ($\nu_{\rm e}$) and their anti-particles ($\bar{\nu}_{\rm e}$), in which the asymmetry
of $\nu_{\rm e}$ and $\bar{\nu}_{\rm e}$ is anti-correlated with each other, occur at almost the
same time as the onset of aspherical shock expansion. We find that the asymmetric neutrino emissions
play a crucial role on occurrences of fast flavor conversions. The linear analysis shows that unstable
modes appear in both pre- and post-shock flows; for the latter they appear only in the hemisphere
of higher $\bar{\nu}_{\rm e}$ emissions (the same hemisphere with stronger shock expansion).
We analyze in depth the characteristics of electron-lepton-number (ELN) crossing by closely inspecting
the angular distributions of neutrinos in momentum space. The ELN crossing happens in various ways,
and the property depends on the radius: in the vicinity of neutron star, $\bar{\nu}_{\rm e}$ ($\nu_{\rm
e}$) dominates over $\nu_{\rm e}$ ($\bar{\nu}_{\rm e}$) in the forward (backward) direction:
at the larger radius the ELN crossing occurs in the opposite way. We also find that the non-radial
ELN crossing occurs at the boundary between no ELN crossing and the radial one, which is an effect
of genuine multi-D transport. Our findings indicate that the collective neutrino oscillation
may occur more commonly in CCSNe and suggest that the CCSN community needs to accommodate these oscillations
self-consistently in the modelling of CCSNe.
