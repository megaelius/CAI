In a framework where galaxies form hierarchically, extended stellar haloes are predicted to be
an ubiquitous feature around Milky Way-like galaxies and to consist mainly of the shredded stellar
component of smaller galactic systems. The type of accreted stellar systems are expected to vary
according to the specific accretion and merging history of a given galaxy, and so is the fraction
of stars formed in-situ versus accreted. Analysis of the chemical properties of Milky Way halo stars
out to large Galactocentric radii can provide important insights into the properties of the environment
in which the stars that contributed to the build-up of different regions of the Milky Way stellar
halo formed. In this work we focus on the outer regions of the Milky Way stellar halo, by determining
chemical abundances of halo stars with large present-day Galactocentric distances, $>$15 kpc.
The data-set we acquired consists of high resolution HET/HRS, Magellan/MIKE and VLT/UVES spectra
for 28 red giant branch stars covering a wide metallicity range, $-3.1 \lesssim$[Fe/H]$\lesssim
-0.6$. We show that the ratio of $\alpha$-elements over Fe as a function of [Fe/H] for our sample of
outer halo stars is not dissimilar from the pattern shown by MW halo stars from solar neighborhood
samples. On the other hand, significant differences appear at [Fe/H]$\gtrsim -1.5$ when considering
chemical abundance ratios such as [Ba/Fe], [Na/Fe], [Ni/Fe], [Eu/Fe], [Ba/Y]. Qualitatively,
this type of chemical abundance trends are observed in massive dwarf galaxies, such as Sagittarius
and the Large Magellanic Cloud. This appears to suggest a larger contribution in the outer halo of
stars formed in an environment with high initial star formation rate and already polluted by asymptotic
giant branch stars with respect to inner halo samples.
