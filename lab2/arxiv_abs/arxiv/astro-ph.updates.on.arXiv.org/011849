Context. The study of young solar type stars is fundamental for a better understanding of the magnetic
activity of the Sun. As a planet in transit crosses in front of its host star, a darkspot on the stellar
surface may be occulted, causing a detectable variation in the light curve. Kepler-63 is a young
solar-like star withan age of only 210 Myr that exhibit photometric variations compatible with
spot signatures. Since its orbiting planet is in an almostpolar orbit, different latitudes of the
star can be probed by the method of spot transit mapping. Methods. A total of 150 transits of Kepler-63b
were observed in the short cadence light curve, corresponding to a total duration of about 4 years.
Each transit light curve was fit by a model that simulates planetary transits and allows the inclusion
of starspots on the surface of the host star. This enables the physical characterisation of the spots
size, intensity, and location. We determine the spot position in a reference frame that rotates
with the star, and thus obtain the latitudinal distribution of the spots. Results. A total of 297
spots were fit and their sizes, intensities, and positions determined. The latitude distribution
of spots exhibits a bimodality with a lack of spots around 34{\deg}. The high latitude spots dominate
the magnetic cycle of Kepler-63. For a mean stellar rotation period of 5.400d, 59 spots were found
at approximately the same longitude and latitude on a later transit. Conclusions. Due to the geometry
of the Kepler-63 system, we were able to build a starspot "butterfly diagram". It was also possible
to infer Kepler-63 differential rotation from the presence of spots at different latitudes. This
star was found to rotate almost rigidly with a period of 5.400d and relative shear close to 0.01% for
latitudes less than 34{\deg}, whereas the high latitudes do not follow a well behaved pattern.
