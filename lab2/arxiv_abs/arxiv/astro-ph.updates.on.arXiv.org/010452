The evolutionary paths taken by very massive stars, $M \gtrsim 60 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$, remain
substantially uncertain: they begin their lives as main sequence O stars, but, depending on their
masses, rotation rates, and metallicities, can then pass through a wide range of evolutionary states,
yielding an equally broad set of possible surface compositions and spectral classifications.
Here we present a new grid of calculations for the evolution of such stars, covering a broad range
in mass (M/M$_\odot = 60 - 150$), rotation rate (v/v$_{\rm crit} = 0 - 0.6$), metallicity ($[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}]
= -4 - 0$), and $\alpha$-element enhancement ($[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}] = 0 - 0.4$). We show that rotating
stars undergo rotationally-induced dredge-up of nucleosynthetic products, mostly He and N, to
their surfaces while still on the main sequence. Non-rotating metal-rich stars also reveal the
products of nucleosynthesis on their surfaces because even modest amounts of mass loss expose their
"fossil" convective cores: regions that are no longer convective, but which were part of the convective
core at an early stage in the star's evolution. Thus surface enhancement of He and N is expected for
rotating stars at all metallicities, and for non-rotating stars if they are relatively metal-rich.
We calculate a stellar atmosphere for a representative model from our grid, properly accounting
for He- and N-enhancement, and show that the resulting spectrum provides a good match to observed
WNL stars, strongly suggesting that the physical mechanisms we have identified are the ultimate
cause of the WNL phase of massive stellar evolution. We conclude that this phase has important implications
for the ionizing spectra of early galaxies.
