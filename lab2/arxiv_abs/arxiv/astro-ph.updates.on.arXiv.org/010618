Spiral galaxies are common in the local Universe, but their formation, evolution, and interplay
with bars remain poorly understood. We use a sample of 391 nearby galaxies from the S$^4$G survey
to characterise the winding angle and amplitude of spiral arms as a function of disc properties,
such as bar strength, in all kinds of spirals (grand-design, multi-armed, and flocculent). We derive
global pitch angles in 3.6 $\mu$m de-projected images from i) average measurements of individual
logarithmic spiral segments, and ii) for a subsample of 32 galaxies, from 2-D Fourier analyses.
The strength of spirals is quantified from the tangential-to-radial force ratio and from the normalised
$m=2$ Fourier density amplitudes. In galaxies with more than one measured logarithmic segment,
the spiral pitch angle varies on average by $\sim 10^{\circ}$ between segments, but by up to $\gtrsim
15-20^{\circ}$. The distribution of the global pitch angle versus Hubble type ($T$) is very similar
for barred and non-barred galaxies when $1 \lesssim T \lesssim 5$. Most spiral galaxies ($>90\%$)
are barred for $T>5$. The pitch angle is not correlated with bar strength, and only weakly with spiral
strength. The amplitude of spirals is correlated with bar strength (and less tightly, with bar length)
for all types of spirals. The mean pitch angle is hardly correlated with the mass of the supermassive
black hole (estimated from central stellar velocity dispersion), with central stellar mass concentration,
or with shear, questioning previous results in the literature using smaller samples. We do not find
observational evidence that spiral arms are driven by stellar bars or by invariant manifolds. Most
likely, disks that are prone to the development of strong bars are also reactive to the formation
of prominent spirals, explaining the observed coupling between bar and spiral amplitudes (Abridged).
