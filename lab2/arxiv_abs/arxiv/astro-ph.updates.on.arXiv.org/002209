We report on a long-term monitoring of a newly discovered X-ray nova, MAXI J1910-057 (= Swift J1910.2-0546),
by MAXI and Swift. The new X-ray transient was first detected on 2012 May 31 by MAXI Gas Slit Camera
(GSC) and Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) almost simultaneously. We analyzed X-ray and UV data
for 270 days since the outburst onset taken by repeated MAXI scans and Swift pointing observations.
The obtained X-ray light curve for the inital 90 days is roughly represented by a fast-rise and exponential-decay
profile. However, it re-brightened on the ~110 days after the onset and finally went down below both
GSC and BAT detec- tion limits on the 240 day. All the X-ray energy spectra are fitted well with a model
consisting of a multi-color-disk blackbody and its Comptonized hard tail. During the soft-state
periods, the inner-disk radius of the best-fit model were almost constant. If the radius represents
the innermost stable circular orbit of a non-spinning black hole and the soft-to-hard transitions
occur at 1-4% of the Eddington luminosity, the mass of the compact object is estimated to be > 2.9Mo
and the distance to be > 1.70 kpc. The inner-disk radius became larger in the hard / hard-intermediate
state. This suggests that the accretion disk would be truncated. We detected an excess of the UV flux
over the disk blackbody component extrapolated from the X-ray data, which can be modelled as reprocessed
emission irradiated by the inner disk. We also found that the UV light curve mostly traced the X-ray
curve, but a short dipping event was observed in both the UV and the X-ray bands with a 3.5-day X-ray
time lag. This can be interpreted as the radial inflow of accreting matter from the outer UV region
to the inner X-ray region.
