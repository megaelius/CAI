We present a study of X-ray source populations in M87, the cD galaxy of the Virgo cluster, using 12
archival {\it Chandra} observations with a total exposure of $\sim$680 ks spanning about a decade.
A total of 346 point-like sources are detected down to a limiting 0.5--8 keV luminosity of $4\times10^{37}{\rm~erg~s^{-1}}$
and out to a galactocentric radius of $\sim$40 kpc. We cross-correlate the X-ray sources with published
catalogs of globular clusters (GCs), derived from the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey and the Next Generation
Virgo Cluster Survey. This results in 122 matches, making it one of the largest samples of GC-hosting
X-ray sources in an external galaxy. These sources, most likely low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs),
correspond to $\sim$5\% of all known GCs within the {\it Chandra} field-of-view. Conversely, $\sim$50\%
of the detected X-ray sources are found in a GC. Moreover, red (metal-rich) GCs are $\sim$2.2 times
more likely to host an X-ray source than blue (metal-poor) GCs. We also examine 76 currently known
ultra-compact dwarf galaxies around M87, but find no significant X-ray counterparts. After statistically
accounting for the cosmic X-ray background, we identify $\sim$110 field-LMXBs. The GC-LMXBs and
field-LMXBs differ in their luminosity function and radial distribution, which indicates that
the latter cannot be primarily originated from GCs. Using another set of deep {\it Chandra} observations
toward $\sim$100 kpc northwest of the M87 center, we statistically constrain the abundance of field-LMXBs
in the stellar halo, which is consistent with that found in the central region. We also identify 40
variable X-ray sources, among which one source is likely a black hole binary residing in a GC.
