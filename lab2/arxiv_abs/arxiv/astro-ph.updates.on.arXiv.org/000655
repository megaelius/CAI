We present new optical coronagraphic data of the bright star Fomalhaut obtained with the HST in 2010/2012
using STIS. Fomalhaut b is recovered at both epochs to high significance. The observations include
the discoveries of tenuous nebulosity beyond the main dust belt detected to at least 209 AU projected
radius and a ~50 AU wide azimuthal gap in the belt northward of Fom b. The morphology of Fomalhaut b
appears elliptical in the STIS detections. We show that residual noise in the processed data can
plausibly result in point sources appearing extended. A MCMC analysis demonstrates that the orbit
of Fom b is highly eccentric, with e=0.8+/-0.1, a=177+/-68 AU, and q = 32+/-24 AU. Fom b is apsidally
aligned with the belt and 90% of allowed orbits have mutual inclination 36 deg or less. Fomalhaut
b's orbit is belt-crossing in projection, but only 12% of possible orbits have nodes within a 25 AU
wide belt annulus (133-158 AU). The high e invokes a dynamical history where Fom b may have experienced
a significant dynamical interaction with a hypothetical planet Fomalhaut c, and the current orbital
configuration may be relatively short-lived. The new value for the periastron distance diminishes
the Hill radius of Fom b and any weakly bound satellite system surrounding a planet would be sheared
and dynamically heated at periapse. We argue that Fom b's minimum mass is that of a dwarf planet in
order for a circumplanetary satellite system to remain bound to a sufficient radius from the planet
to be consistent with the dust scattered light hypothesis. Fom b may be optically bright because
the recent passage through periapse and/or the ascending node has increased the erosion rates of
planetary satellites. In the coplanar case, Fomalhaut b will collide with the main belt around 2032,
and the subsequent emergent phenomena may help determine its physical nature.
