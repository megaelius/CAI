We present the first results of a project called SAGAN, dedicated solely to the studies of relatively
rare megaparsec-scale radio galaxies in the Universe, called the Giant Radio Galaxies (GRGs).
We have identified 162 new GRGs primarily from the NVSS with sizes ranging from ~0.71 Mpc to ~2.82
Mpc in the redshift range of ~0.03 - 0.95. As part of the project SAGAN, we have created a database of
all known GRGs-`GRG-catalogue' from literature (including our new sample) of 820 sources. For
the first time, we present the multi-wavelength properties of the largest sample of GRGs, providing
new insights about their nature. Our results firmly establish that the distributions of radio spectral
index and the black hole mass of GRGs do not differ from the corresponding distributions of normal
sized radio galaxies (RGs). However, GRGs have lower Eddington ratio than RGs. Using the mid-infrared
data, we have classified GRGs in terms of their accretion mode: either high-power radiatively-efficient,
high-excitation state or a radiatively-inefficient low-excitation state. This enables us to
compare key physical properties of their AGN like the black hole mass, spin, Eddington ratio, jet
kinetic power, total radio power, magnetic field and size. We find that GRGs in high excitation state
statistically have larger sizes, radio power, jet kinetic power and Eddington ratio than those
in low excitation state. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between black hole's accretion
efficiency and jet kinetic power, thus suggesting a disk-jet coupling. Our environmental study
reveals that ~10% of all GRGs may reside at the centres of galaxy clusters, in a denser galactic environment
while majority seem to reside in sparse environment. The probability of finding the brightest cluster
galaxy (BCG) as GRG is quite low and even lower for high mass clusters. Abridged.
