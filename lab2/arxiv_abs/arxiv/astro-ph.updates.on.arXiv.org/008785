Context. In previous work, we studied a prominence which appeared like a tornado in a movie made from
193 {\AA} filtergrams obtained with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) imager aboard the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The observations in H$\alpha$ obtained simultaneously during two
consecutive sequences of one hour with the Multi-channel Subtractive Double Pass Spectrograph
(MSDP) operating at the solar tower in Meudon showed that the cool plasma inside the tornado was not
rotating around its vertical axis. Furthermore, the evolution of the Dopplershift pattern suggested
the existence of oscillations of periods close to the time-span of each sequence. Aims. The aim of
the present work is to assemble the two sequences of H$\alpha$ observations as a full data set lasting
two hours to confirm the existence of oscillations, and determine their nature. Methods. After
having coaligned the Doppler maps of the two sequences, we use a Scargle periodogram analysis and
cosine fitting to compute the periods and the phase of the oscillations in the full data set. Results.
Our analysis confirms the existence of oscillations with periods between 40 and 80 minutes. In the
Dopplershift maps, we identify large areas with strong spectral power. In two of them, the oscillations
of individual pixels are in phase. However, in the top area of the prominence, the phase is varying
slowly, suggesting wave propagation. Conclusions. We conclude that the prominence does not oscillate
as a whole structure but exhibits different areas with their own oscillation periods and characteristics:
standing or propagating waves. We discuss the nature of the standing oscillations and the propagating
waves. These can be interpreted in terms of gravito-acoustic modes and magnetosonic waves, respectively.
