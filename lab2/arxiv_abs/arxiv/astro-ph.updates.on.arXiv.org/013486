The innermost astronomical unit in protoplanetary disks is a key region for stellar and planet formation,
as exoplanet searches have shown a large occurrence of close-in planets that are located within
the first au around their host star. We aim to reveal the morphology of the disk inner rim using near-infrared
interferometric observations with milli-arcsecond resolution provided by infrared interferometry.
We provide reconstructed images of 15 objects selected from the Herbig AeBe survey carried out with
PIONIER at the VLTI, using SPARCO. We find that 40% of the systems are centrosymmetric at the angular
resolution of the observations. For the rest of the objects, we find evidence for asymmetric emission
due to moderate-to-strong inclination of a disk-like structure for 30% of the objects and noncentrosymmetric
morphology due to a nonaxisymmetric and possibly variable environment (30%). Among the systems
with a disk-like structure, 20% show a resolved dust-free cavity. The image reconstruction process
is a powerful tool to reveal complex disk inner rim morphologies. At the angular resolution reached
by near-infrared interferometric observations, most of the images are compatible with a centrally
peaked emission (no cavity). For the most resolved targets, image reconstruction reveals morphologies
that cannot be reproduced by generic parametric models. Moreover, the nonaxisymmetric disks show
that the spatial resolution probed by optical interferometers makes the observations of the near-infrared
emission sensitive to temporal evolution with a time-scale down to a few weeks. The evidence of nonaxisymmetric
emission that cannot be explained by simple inclination and radiative transfer effects requires
alternative explanations, such as a warping of the inner disks. Interferometric observations
can, therefore, be used to follow the evolution of the asymmetry of those disks at a sub-au scale.
