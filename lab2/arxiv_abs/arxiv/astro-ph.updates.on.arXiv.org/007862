Paleo-Detectors are ancient minerals which can record and retain tracks induced by nuclear recoils
over billion year timescales. They may represent the most sensitive method for the direct detection
of Dark Matter (DM) to date. Here, we improve upon the cut-and-count approach previously employed
for paleo-detectors by performing a full spectral analysis of the DM- and background-induced track
length distributions. This spectral analysis allows us to project improved exclusion limits and
detection thresholds for DM. Further, we investigate the impact of background shape uncertainties
using realistic background models. We find that in the most optimistic case of a %-level understanding
of the background shape, we can achieve sensitivity to DM-nucleon scattering cross sections up
to a factor of 100 smaller than current XENON1T bounds for DM masses above $100\,$GeV. For DM lighter
than $ 10\,$GeV, paleo-detectors can probe DM-nucleon cross sections many orders of magnitude
below current experimental limits. Allowing for larger uncertainties in the shape of the backgrounds,
we find that the impact on the sensitivity is considerable. However, assuming 10% bin-to-bin shape
uncertainties, the sensitivity of paleo-detectors still improves over XENON1T limits by a factor
of $\sim 8$ for DM heavier than $ 100\,$GeV. For lighter DM candidates, even with 50% bin-to-bin background
shape uncertainties, paleo-detectors could achieve sensitivities an order of magnitude better
than proposed conventional low-threshold experiments. Finally we show that, in the case of a DM
discovery, regions in which the mass can be constrained extend to significantly higher DM masses
than for proposed conventional experiments. For DM-nucleon cross sections just below current
XENON1T limits, paleo-detectors could constrain the DM mass even if the new particle is as heavy
as $ 1 \mathrm{\,TeV}$.
