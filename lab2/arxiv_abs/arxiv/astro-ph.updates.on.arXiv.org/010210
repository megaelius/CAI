With the aim to find links between the properties of supernova (SN) Ia progenitors and elliptical
host stellar populations, we present an analysis of the galactocentric distributions of the "normal"
and peculiar "91bg-like" subclasses of SNe Ia, and study the global parameters (absolute magnitude,
colour, size, stellar mass, metallicity and age) of their host galaxies. We use a well-defined sample
of morphologically non-disturbed 109 SNe Ia host ellipticals from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
The galactocentric distributions of normal and 91bg-like SNe are consistent with each other, and
with the radial light distribution of host stellar populations, when excluding bias against central
SNe. Among the global parameters, only the distributions of u-r colours and ages are inconsistent
significantly between the ellipticals of different SN Ia subclasses: the hosts of normal SNe are
on average bluer and younger than those of 91bg-like SNe. In the colour-mass diagram, the tail of
colour distribution of normal SN hosts stretches into the Green Valley - transitional state of galaxy
evolution, while the same tail of 91bg-like SN hosts barely reaches that region. Therefore, the
bluer and younger ellipticals might have more residual star formation that gives rise to younger
"prompt" progenitors, resulting in normal SNe Ia with shorter delay times. These ellipticals can
also produce "delayed" 91bg-like events with lower rate, because of long delay times of these SNe.
The redder and older ellipticals that already exhausted their gas for star formation may produce
significantly less normal SNe Ia with shorter delay times, outnumbered by 91bg-like SNe with long
delay times. Our results favor SN Ia progenitor models such as He-ignited violent mergers as a unified
model for normal and 91bg-like SNe that have the potential to explain their observed properties.
