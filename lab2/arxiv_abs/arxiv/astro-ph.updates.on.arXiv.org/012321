The spatial clustering of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is considered to be one of the important
diagnostics for the understanding of the underlying processes behind their activities complementary
to their abundance. We analyse the AGN clustering from a recent semi-analytic model performed on
a large cosmological $N$-body simulation covering a cubic gigaparsec comoving volume. The recipe
for the model has previously been shown to reproduce the observed luminosity function of AGN quite
well over a wide redshift range ($z\lesssim 6$), with a newly introduced timescale to account for
the loss of the angular momentum on small scales in the accretion process on to the supermassive black
holes. The large simulation box allows us accurate determination of the auto-correlation function
of the AGNs. The model prediction indicates that this timescale plays a significant role in allowing
massive halos to host relatively faint population of AGNs, leading to a higher bias factor for those
AGNs. The model predictions are in agreement with observations of X-ray selected AGNs in the luminosity
range $10^{41.5}~\mathrm{erg} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1} \leq L_{2-10\mathrm{keV}} \leq 10^{44.5}~\mathrm{erg}
\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, with the typical host halo mass of $10^{12.5-13.5} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ at $z
\lesssim 1$. Moreover, we find that not only the effective halo mass corresponding to the overall
bias factor, but the extended shape of the predicted AGN correlation function shows remarkable
agreement with those from observations. Further observational efforts in the near future towards
the low luminosity end at redshift $\sim 1$ would give us stronger constraints on the triggering
mechanisms of AGN activities through the clustering properties.
