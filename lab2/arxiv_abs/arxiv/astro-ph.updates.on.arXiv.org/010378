SPB star HD 50230, in fact a hybrid B-type pulsator, has been observed by CoRoT least 137 days. A nearly
equidistant period spacing pattern are found among 8 modes which are extracted from the oscillation
spectrum with more than 500 frequencies. However, it is thought to be most likely accidental by Szewczuk
et al. (2014). In the present work, we analyze the 8 modes in depth with the $\chi^2$-matching method.
Based on the best fitting model (model MA), we find that they can be well explained as a sequences of
consecutive dipolar $(l,~m)=(1,~0)$. The period discrepancies between observations and the
best fitting model are within 100 s except for the outlier which is up to 300 s. Based on the calculated
CMMs, we find that, for pure g-mode oscillations, the buoyancy radius $\Lambda_{0}$ can be precisely
measured with the $\chi^2$-matching method between observations and calculations. It represents
the "Propagation time" of the g-mode from stellar surface to center. It is of $\Lambda_{0}=245.78\pm0.59~\mu$Hz
with a precision of 0.24\%. In addition, we also find that HD 50230 is a metal-rich ($Z_{\rm init}=0.034-0.043$)
star with a mass of $M=6.15-6.27~{\rm M_{\odot}}$. It is still located on hydrogen-burning phase
with central hydrogen $X_{\rm C}=0.298-0.316$ (or $X_{\rm C}=0.306^{+0.010}_{-0.008}$), therefore
has a convective core with a radius of $R_{\rm cc}=0.525-0.536~{\rm R_{\odot}}$ (or $R_{\rm cc}=0.531^{+0.005}_{-0.006}~{\rm
R_{\odot}}$). In order to well interpret the structure of observed period spacing pattern, the
convective core overshooting ($f_{\rm ov}=0.0175-0.0200$) and the extra diffusion mixing ($\log
D_{\rm mix}=3.7-3.9$) should be taken into account in theoretical models.
