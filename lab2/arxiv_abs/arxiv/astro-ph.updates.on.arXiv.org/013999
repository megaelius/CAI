Using a set of cosmological hydro-dynamical simulations, we constrained the properties of primordial
magnetic fields by studying their impact on the formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies. We performed
a large set of simulations (8 dark matter only and 72 chemo-hydrodynamical) including primordial
magnetic fields through the extra density fluctuations they induce at small length scales ($k \geq
10\,h\,\rm{Mpc^{-1}}$) in the matter power spectrum. We explored a large variety of primordial
magnetic fields with strength $B_\lambda$ ranging from $0.05$ to $0.50\,\textrm{nG}$ and magnetic
energy spectrum slopes $n_B$ from $-2.9$ to $-2.1$. Strong magnetic fields characterized by a high
amplitude ($B_\lambda=0.50,\,0.20\,\textrm{nG}$ with $n_B=-2.9$) or by a steep initial power
spectrum slope ($n_B=-2.1,-2.4$, with $B_\lambda=0.05\,\textrm{nG}$) induce perturbations
in the mass scales from $10^7$ to $10^9\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$. In this context emerging galaxies see
their star formation rate strongly boosted. They become more luminous and metal rich than their
counterparts without primordial magnetic fields. Such strong fields are ruled out by their inability
to reproduce the observed scaling relations of dwarf galaxies. They predict dwarf galaxies to be
at the origin of an unrealistically early reionization of the Universe and also overproduce luminous
satellites in the Local Group. Weaker magnetic fields impacting the primordial density field at
corresponding masses $\lesssim 10^6\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$, produce a large number of mini dark halos
orbiting the dwarfs, however out of reach for current lensing observations. This study allows for
the first time to constrain the properties of primordial magnetic fields based on realistic cosmological
simulations of dwarf galaxies.
