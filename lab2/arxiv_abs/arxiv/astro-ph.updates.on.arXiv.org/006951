Multiple stellar populations have been observed in almost all globular clusters, but the origin
of this phenomenon is still debated. Here we investigate the role cool supergiants may have played.
To do this, we combine two investigative methods: state-of-the-art massive stellar evolution
and calculations of the hydrodynamic structure of the cluster gas. We find that the presence of cool,
massive (9-500 M$_{\odot}$) metal-poor supergiants in the young cluster leads to a star formation
episode before the first core-collapse supernovae explode. The stellar winds of massive stars
is accumulated in the cluster center, forming the second generation of stars. Their composition
is predicted to show variations in O and Na abundances, consistently with observations. The abundance
of helium is, similarly to other scenarios involving massive stars, higher than what is referred
from observations. As the second generation is formed centrally located, dynamical removal of
stars from the outskirts of the cluster may help to account for the mass budget problem. Taking into
account a top-heavy initial mass function, we are able to predict a number ratio of the second generation
of stars as high as 20-80%. The effect of metallicity is shown to be important, as the most luminous
supergiants are only predicted at low-metallicity, thus limiting$-$but not excluding$-$the
extent with which a polluted second generation may form at high-metallicity. The massive stars
in the first generation are expected to become black holes, thus supporting globular clusters'
suggested role in hosting progenitors of gravitational wave emission. We find that the mass of the
second stellar generation depends on the initial mass of the cluster, which may result in observing
a correlation between the mass of the globular cluster and the extent of the multiple population
phenomenon.
