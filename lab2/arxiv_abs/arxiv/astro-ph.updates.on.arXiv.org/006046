We report an observational study of the giant molecular cloud (GMC) associated with the Galactic
infrared ring-like structure N35 and two nearby HII regions G024.392+00.072 (HII region A) and
G024.510-00.060 (HII region B), using the new CO J=1-0 data obtained as a part of the FOREST Unbiased
Galactic Plane Imaging survey with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope (FUGIN) project at a spatial resolution
of 21". Our CO data revealed that the GMC, with a total molecular mass of 2.1x10^6Mo, has two velocity
components over ~10-15km/s. The majority of molecular gas in the GMC is included in the lower-velocity
component (LVC) at ~110-114km/s, while the higher-velocity components (HVCs) at ~118-126km/s
consist of three smaller molecular clouds which are located near the three HII regions. The LVC and
HVCs show spatially complementary distributions along the line-of-sight, despite large velocity
separations of ~5-15km/s, and are connected in velocity by the CO emission with intermediate intensities.
By comparing the observations with simulations, we discuss a scenario where collisions of the three
HVCs with LVC at velocities of ~10-15km/s can provide an interpretation of these two observational
signatures. The intermediate velocity features between the LVC and HVCs can be understood as broad
bridge features, which indicate the turbulent motion of the gas at the collision interfaces, while
the spatially complementary distributions represent the cavities created in the LVC by the HVCs
through the collisions. Our model indicates that the three HII regions were formed after the onset
of the collisions, and it is therefore suggested that the high-mass star formation in the GMC was
triggered by the collisions.
