Plastic scintillators are widely used as particle detectors in many fields, mainly, medicine,
particle physics and astrophysics. Traditionally, they are coupled to a photo-multplier (PMT)
but now silicon photo-multipliers (SiPM) are evolving as a promising robust alternative, specially
in space born experiments since plastic scintillators may be a light option for low Earth orbit missions.
Therefore it is timely to make a new analysis of the optimal design for experiments based on plastic
scintillators in realistic conditions in such a configuration. We analyze here their response
to an isotropic flux of electron and proton primaries in the energy range from 1 MeV to 1 GeV, a typical
scenario for cosmic ray or space weather experiments, through detailed GEANT4 simulations. First,
we focus on the effect of increasing the ratio between the plastic volume and the area of the photo-detector
itself and, second, on the benefits of using a reflective coating around the plastic, the most common
technique to increase light collection efficiency. In order to achieve a general approach, it is
necessary to consider several detector setups. Therefore, we have performed a full set of simulations
using the highly tested GEANT4 simulation tool: several parameters have been analyzed such as the
energy lost in the coating, the deposited energy in the scintillator, the optical absorption, the
fraction of scintillation photons that are not detected, the light collection at the photo-detector,
the pulse shape and its time parameters and finally, other design parameters as the surface roughness,
the coating reflectivity and the case of a scintillator with two decay components. This work could
serve as a guide on the design of future experiments based on the use of plastic scintillators.
