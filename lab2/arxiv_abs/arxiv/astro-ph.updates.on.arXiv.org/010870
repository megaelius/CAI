For a binary composed of a spinning black hole (BH) (with mass $\gtrsim 7M_\odot$) and a strongly
magnetized neutron star (NS) (with surface magnetic field strength $B_{\rm S,NS}\gtrsim10^{12}$\,G
and mass $\sim 1.4M_\odot$), the NS as a whole will possibly eventually plunge into the BH. During
the inspiral phase, the spinning BH could be charged to the Wald charge quantity $Q_{\rm W}$ until
merger in an electro-vacuum approximation. During the merger, if the spinning charged BH creates
its own magnetosphere due to an electric field strong enough for pair cascades to spark, the charged
BH would transit from electro-vacuum to force-free cases and could discharge in a time $\gtrsim1~{\rm
ms}$. As the force-free magnetosphere is full of a highly conducting plasma, the magnetic flux over
the NS's caps would be retained outside the BH's event horizon under the frozen-in condition. Based
on this scenario, we here investigate three possible energy-dissipation mechanisms that could
produce electromagnetic (EM) counterparts in a time interval of the BH's discharge post a BH-NS
merger-induced gravitational wave event: (1) magnetic reconnection at the BH's poles would occur,
leading to a millisecond bright EM signal, (2) a magnetic shock in the zone of closed magnetic field
lines due to the detachment and reconnection of the entire BH magnetic field would probably produce
a bright radio emission, e.g., a fast radio burst, and (3) the Blandford-Znajek mechanism would
extract the BH's rotational energy, giving rise to a millisecond-duration luminous high-energy
burst. We also calculate the luminosities due to these mechanisms as a function of BH's spin for different
values of $B_{\rm S,NS}$.
