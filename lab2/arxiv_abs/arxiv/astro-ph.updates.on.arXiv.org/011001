The Large Volume Detector (LVD), hosted in the INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, is triggered
by atmospheric muons at a rate of $\sim 0.1$~Hz. The data collected over almost a quarter of century
are used to study the muon intensity underground. The 50-million muon series, the longest ever exploited
by an underground instrument, allows for the accurate long-term monitoring of the muon intensity
underground. This is relevant as a study of the background in the Gran Sasso Laboratory, which hosts
a variety of long-duration, low-background detectors. We describe the procedure to select muon-like
events as well as the method used to compute the exposure. We report the value of the average muon flux
measured from 1994 to 2017: $\mathrm{I_{\mu}^0 = 3.35 \pm 0.0005^{stat}\pm 0.03^{sys} \cdot 10^{-4}
~m^{-2} s^{-1}}$. We show that the intensity is modulated around this average value due to temperature
variations in the stratosphere. We quantify such a correlation by using temperature data from the
European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts: we find an effective temperature coefficient
$\mathrm{\alpha_{T}} = 0.94\pm0.01^{stat} \pm0.01^{sys}$, in agreement with other measurements
at the same depth. %This is the most precise measurement underground at a minimal depth of 3000 m w.e..
We scrutinise the spectral content of the time series of the muon intensity by means of the Lomb-Scargle
analysis. This yields the evidence of a 1-year periodicity, as well as the indication of others,
both shorter and longer, suggesting that the series is not a pure sinusoidal wave. Consequently,
and for the first time, we characterise the observed modulation in terms of amplitude and position
of maximum and minimum on a year-by-year basis.
