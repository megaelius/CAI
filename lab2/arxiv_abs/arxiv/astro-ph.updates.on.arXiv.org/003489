We investigate a physical, composite alignment model for both spiral and elliptical galaxies and
its impact on cosmological parameter estimation from weak lensing for a tomographic survey. Ellipticity
correlation functions and angular ellipticity spectra for spiral and elliptical galaxies are
derived on the basis of tidal interactions with the cosmic large-scale structure and compared to
the tomographic weak lensing signal. We find that elliptical galaxies cause a contribution to the
weak-lensing dominated ellipticity correlation on intermediate angular scales between $\ell\simeq40$
and $\ell\simeq400$ before that of spiral galaxies dominates on higher multipoles. The predominant
term on intermediate scales is the negative cross-correlation between intrinsic alignments and
weak gravitational lensing (GI-alignment). We simulate parameter inference from weak gravitational
lensing with intrinsic alignments unaccounted; the bias induced by ignoring intrinsic alignments
in a survey like Euclid is shown to be several times larger than the statistical error and can lead
to faulty conclusions when comparing to other observations. The biases generally point into different
directions in parameter space, such that in some cases one can observe a partial cancellation effect.
Furthermore, it is shown that the biases increase with the number of tomographic bins used for the
parameter estimation process. We quantify this parameter estimation bias in units of the statistical
error and compute the loss of Bayesian evidence for a model due to the presence of systematic errors
as well as the Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify the distance between the true model and the
wrongly inferred one.
