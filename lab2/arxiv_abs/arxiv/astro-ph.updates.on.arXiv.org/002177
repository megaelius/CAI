We investigate the impact of an ionising X-ray background on metal-free Population III stars within
a minihalo at $z\simeq25$ starting from cosmological initial conditions. Using the smoothed particle
hydrodynamics code GADGET-2, we attain sufficient numerical resolution to follow the gas collapsing
into the centre of the minihalo up to densities of $n=10^{12}\,cm^{-3}$, at which point we form sink
particles. This allows us to study how the presence of a cosmic X-ray background (CXB) affects the
formation of H$_2$ and HD in the gas before it becomes fully molecular. Using a suite of simulations
for a range of possible CXB models, we follow each simulation for 5000 yr after the formation of the
first sink particle. The CXB provides two competing effects, with X-rays both heating the gas and
enhancing its ability to cool by increasing the free electron fraction, allowing more H$_2$ to form.
We find that X-ray heating dominates below $n\sim1\,cm^{-3}$, while the additional cooling catalysed
by X-ray ionisation becomes more important above $n\sim10^2\,cm^{-3}$. Heating the gas impedes
its collapse, decreasing the total amount of gas available for star formation. However if the CXB
is strong enough, the gas that does collapse cools sufficiently to activate HD cooling, leading
to further cooling and fragmentation. If at the same time the CXB is also not so strong as to choke off
the supply of gas collapsing into the halo, this additional cooling allows more of the available
gas to collapse to high densities, counteracting the effects of X-ray heating at low densities and
increasing both the total mass and number of sink particles dramatically. This leads to a `Goldilocks'
range of CXB strengths for which fragmentation increases significantly, from 2-3 sink particles
to 10; continuing to increase the CXB chokes off the gas supply and suppresses both sink formation
and fragmentation.
