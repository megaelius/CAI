To investigate the excitation of kink oscillations in coronal loops and filaments, a C3.4 circular-ribbon
flare (CRF) associated with a blowout jet in active region 12434 on 2015 October 16 is analyzed. The
flare excited small-amplitude kink oscillation of a remote coronal loop. The oscillation lasted
for $\ge$4 cycles without significant damping. The amplitude and period are 0.3$\pm$0.1 Mm and
207$\pm$12 s. Interestingly, the flare also excited transverse oscillation of a remote filament.
The oscillation lasted for $\sim$3.5 cycles with decaying amplitudes. The initial amplitude is
1.7$-$2.2 Mm. The period and damping time are 437$-$475 s and 1142$-$1600 s. The starting times of
simultaneous oscillations of coronal loop and filament were concurrent with the hard X-ray peak
time. Though small in size and short in lifetime, the flare set off a chain reaction. It generated
a bright secondary flare ribbon (SFR) in the chromosphere, remote brightening (RB) that was cospatial
with the filament, and intermittent, jet-like flow propagating in the northeast direction. The
loop oscillation is most probably excited by the flare-induced blast wave at a speed of $\ge$1300
km s$^{-1}$. The excitation of the filament oscillation is more complicated. The blast wave triggers
secondary magnetic reconnection far from the main flare, which not only heats the local plasma to
higher temperatures (SFR and RB), but produces jet-like flow (i.e., reconnection outflow) as well.
The filament is disturbed by the secondary magnetic reconnection and experiences transverse oscillation.
The findings give new insight into the excitation of transverse oscillations of coronal loops and
filaments.
