Current data analyses combine diverse cosmological probes to break degeneracy between cosmological
parameters using, for instance, the data from Type IA supernova data or from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations
(BAO). Regarding the use of the BAO data, this can lead to biased inferences of the cosmological parameters
in study because the comoving BAO sound horizon at drag epoch, $r_{\rm drag}$, used to quantify the
BAO measurements $H(z)$ and $D_{A}(z)$, is inferred from a combination of cosmic microwave background
(CMB) data and a theoretical model, as WMAP and Planck collaborations did. One can avoid possibly
biased analyses combining CMB data in conjunction with a set of 15 measurements of the transversal
BAO scale, considered cosmological model-independent to explore, via Monte Carlo Markov chains,
the parametric space of some cosmological models. We investigate how much Planck CMB data in combination
with transversal BAO measurements can constraints the minimum $\Lambda$CDM model, and extensions
including additional parameters as $r_{\rm drag}$, neutrinos mass scale $M_{\nu}$, and the possibility
for a dynamical dark energy model. Assuming the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we find $H_0 = 69.23 \pm
0.50$ km s${}^{-1}$ Mpc${}^{-1}$, $M_{\nu} < 0.11$ eV and $r_{\rm drag} = 147.59 \pm 0.26$ Mpc from
Planck + transversal BAO data. When assuming a dynamical dark energy cosmology, we find that the
inclusion of the BAO data can indeed break the degeneracy of the dark energy free parameters, improving
the constraints on the full parameter space significantly. We note that the model is compatible
with local measurements of $H_0$ and there is no tension on $H_0$ estimates. Also, we discuss the
results from a joint analysis with the latest local $H_0$ measurement. Finally, we perform a model-independent
analysis for the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ from our compilation of the transversal BAO data.
