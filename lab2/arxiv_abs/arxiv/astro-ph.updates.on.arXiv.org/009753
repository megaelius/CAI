In previous papers of this series, we developed a new algorithm for modeling the formation of star
clusters in galaxy formation simulations. Here we investigate how dissolution of bound star clusters
affects the shape of the cluster mass function and the metallicity distribution of surviving clusters.
Cluster evolution includes the loss of stars that become unbound due to tidal disruption as well
as mass-loss due to stellar evolution. We calculate the tidal tensor along cluster trajectories
and use it to estimate the instantaneous mass-loss rate. The typical tidal tensor exhibits large
variations on a time-scale of $\sim100$~Myr, with maximum eigenvalue of $10^7$~Gyr$^{-2}$, and
median value of $10^4$~Gyr$^{-2}$ for the first Gyr after cluster formation. As a result of dynamical
disruption, at the final available output of our simulations at redshift $z\approx1.5$, the cluster
mass function has an approximately log-normal shape peaked at $\sim10^{4.3}M_\odot$. Extrapolation
of the disruption to $z=0$ results in too many low-mass clusters compared to the observed Galactic
globular clusters (GCs). Over 70\% of GC candidates are completely disrupted before the present;
only 10\% of the total GC candidate mass remains in surviving clusters. The total mass of surviving
clusters at $z=0$ varies from run to run in the range $(2-6)\times10^7M_\odot$, consistent with
the observed mass of GC systems in Milky Way-sized galaxies. The metallicity distributions of all
massive star clusters and of the surviving GCs have similar shapes but different normalization
because of cluster disruption. The model produces a larger fraction of very metal-poor clusters
than observed. A robust prediction of the model is the age-metallicity relation, in which metal-rich
clusters are systematically younger than metal-poor clusters by up to 3~Gyr.
