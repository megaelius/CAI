Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are likely the thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen (CO) white-dwarf
(WD) stars, but their progenitor systems remain elusive. Recent studies have suggested that a propagating
detonation within a thin helium shell surrounding a sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO core can subsequently
trigger a detonation within the core (the double-detonation model, DDM). The outcome of this explosion
is similar to a central ignition of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO WD (SCD). While SCD is consistent
with some observational properties of SNe Ia, several computational challenges prohibit a robust
comparison to the observations. We focus on the observed $t_0-M_\text{Ni56}$ relation, where
$t_0$ (the $\gamma$-rays' escape time from the ejecta) is positively correlated with $M_\text{Ni56}$
(the synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass). We apply our recently developed numerical scheme to calculate
SCD and show that the calculated $t_0-M_\text{Ni56}$ relation, which does not require radiation
transfer calculations, converges to an accuracy of a few percent. We find a clear tension between
our calculations and the observed $t_0-M_\text{Ni56}$ relation. SCD predicts an anti-correlation
between $t_0$ and $M_\text{Ni56}$, with $t_0\approx30\,\textrm{day}$ for luminous ($M_\text{Ni56}\gtrsim0.5\,M_{\odot}$)
SNe Ia, while the observed $t_0$ is in the range of $35-45\,\textrm{day}$. We show that this tension
is larger than the uncertainty of the results, and that it exists in all previous studies of the problem.
Our results hint that more complicated models are required, but we argue that DDM is unlikely to resolve
the tension with the observations.
