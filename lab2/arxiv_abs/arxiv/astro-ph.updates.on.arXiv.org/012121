The C statistics, also known as the Cash statistic, is often used in astronomy for the analysis of
low-count Poisson data. One of the challenges of the C statistic is that its probability distribution,
under the null hypothesis that the data follow a parent model, is not known exactly. Such distribution
is needed for model testing, namely to determine the acceptability of models and then to determine
confidence intervals of model parameters. This is in contrast with the accurate knowledge, for
Gaussian data, of the $\chi^2$ statistic for any number of free parameters in the parent model. This
paper presents an effort towards improving our understanding of the C statistic by studying (a)
the distribution of for a fully specified model, (b) the distribution of $C_{min}$ resulting from
a maximum-likelihood fit to a simple one-parameter constant model, i.e., a model that represents
the sample mean of $N$ Poisson measurements, and (c) the distribution of the associated $\Delta
C$ statistic that is used for parameter estimation. The results confirm the expectation that, in
the high-count limit, both statistics have the same mean and variance as a $\chi^2$ statistic with
same number of degrees of freedom. It is also found that, in the low-count regime, the expectation
of the C statistic can be substantially lower than for a $\chi^2$ distribution. These result have
implications for hypothesis testing in the low-count Poisson regime that are also discussed in
the paper. The paper makes use of recent X-ray observations of the astronomical source PG 1116+215
to illustrate the application of the C statistic to Poisson data. These measurements are also used
to identify biases in the use of the $\chi^2$ statistic for Poisson data, especially in the low-count
regime.
