The orbital and attitude dynamics of uncontrolled Earth orbiting objects are perturbed by a variety
of sources. In research, emphasis has been put on operational space vehicles. Operational satellites
typically have a relatively compact shape, and hence, a low area-to-mass ratio (AMR), and are in
most cases actively or passively attitude stabilized. This enables one to treat the orbit and attitude
propagation as decoupled problems, and in many cases the attitude dynamics can be neglected completely.
The situation is different for space debris objects, which are in an uncontrolled attitude state.
Furthermore, the assumption that a steady-state attitude motion can be averaged over data reduction
intervals may no longer be valid. Additionally, a subset of the debris objects have significantly
high area-to-mass ratio values, resulting in highly perturbed orbits, e.g. by solar radiation
pressure, even if a stable AMR value is assumed. This assumption implies a steady-state attitude
such that the average cross-sectional area exposed to the sun is close to constant. Time-varying
solar radiation pressure accelerations due to attitude variations will result in un-modeled errors
in the state propagation. This work investigates the evolution of the coupled attitude and orbit
motion of HAMR objects. Standardized pieces of multilayer insulation are simulated in near geosynchronous
orbits. It is assumed that the objects are rigid bodies and are in uncontrolled attitude states.
The integrated effects of the Earth gravitational field and solar radiation pressure on the attitude
motion are investigated. The light curves that represent the observed brightness variations over
time in a specific viewing direction are extracted. A sensor model is utilized to generate light
curves with visibility constraints and magnitude uncertainties as observed by a standard ground
based telescope.
