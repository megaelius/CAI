Associated absorption lines (AALs) in quasar spectra are valuable probes of the gas kinematics
and physical conditions in quasar environments. The host galaxies are by definition in an active
evolution stage that might involve large-scale blowouts and/or cold-mode accretion (infall)
from the intergalactic medium (IGM). We discuss rest-frame UV spectra of four redshift 2-3 quasars
selected to have low-ionisation AALs of SiII or CII that place unique density and distance constraints
on the absorbers. Our analysis of the AALs yields the following results. One of the quasars, Q0119$-$046,
has a rich complex of 11 AAL systems that appear to be infalling at measured speeds from $\sim$0 to
$\sim$1150 km s$^{-1}$ at distance $\sim$5.7 kpc from the quasar. The range of ions detected, up
to NeVIII, indicates a wide range of densities from $\sim$4 to $\sim$2500 cm$^{-3}$. Partial covering
the quasar emission source requires cloud sizes $<$1 pc and possibly $<$0.01 pc. The short dissipation
times of these small clouds suggests that they are created in situ at their observed location, perhaps
as dense condensations in cold-mode accreting gas from IGM. The AALs in the other three quasars have
outflow speeds from $\sim$1900 to $\sim$3000 km s$^{-1}$. Some of them also appear to have a range
of densities based on the range of ions detected, including MgI $\lambda$2853 in Q0105+061. However,
the absence of excited-state AALs yields only upper limits on their gas densities ($\lesssim150$
cm$^{-3}$) and large minimum distances ($\gtrsim$40 kpc) from the quasars. These AALs might represent
highly extended quasar-driven outflows, although their actual physical relationships to the
quasars cannot be established.
