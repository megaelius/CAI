Cosmological measurements of structure are placing increasingly strong constraints on the sum
of the neutrino masses, $\Sigma m_\nu$, through Bayesian inference. Because these constraints
depend on the choice for the prior probability $\pi(\Sigma m_\nu)$, we argue that this prior should
be motivated by fundamental physical principles rather than the ad hoc choices that are common in
the literature. The first step in this direction is to specify the prior directly at the level of the
neutrino mass matrix $M_\nu$, since this is the parameter appearing in the Lagrangian of the particle
physics theory. Thus by specifying a probability distribution over $M_\nu$, and by including the
known squared mass splittings, we predict a theoretical probability distribution over $\Sigma
m_\nu$ that we interpret as a Bayesian prior probability $\pi(\Sigma m_\nu)$. We find that $\pi(\Sigma
m_\nu)$ peaks close to the smallest $\Sigma m_\nu$ allowed by the measured mass splittings, roughly
$0.06 \, {\rm eV}$ ($0.1 \, {\rm eV}$) for normal (inverted) ordering, due to the phenomenon of eigenvalue
repulsion in random matrices. We consider three models for neutrino mass generation: Dirac, Majorana,
and Majorana via the seesaw mechanism; differences in the predicted priors $\pi(\Sigma m_\nu)$
allow for the possibility of having indications about the physical origin of neutrino masses once
sufficient experimental sensitivity is achieved. We present fitting functions for $\pi(\Sigma
m_\nu)$, which provide a simple means for applying these priors to cosmological constraints on
the neutrino masses or marginalizing over their impact on other cosmological parameters.
