We present a new analysis of very deep Chandra observations of the galaxy cluster Abell 1795. Utilizing
nearly 750 ks of net ACIS imaging, we are able to resolve the thermodynamic structure of the Intracluster
Medium (ICM) on length scales of ~ 1 kpc near the cool core. We find several previously unresolved
structures, including a high pressure feature to the north of the BCG that appears to arise from the
bulk motion of Abell 1795's cool core. To the south of the cool core, we find low temperature (~ 3 keV),
diffuse ICM gas extending for distances of ~ 50 kpc spatially coincident with previously identified
filaments of H-alpha emission. Gas at similar temperatures is also detected in adjacent regions
without any H-alpha emission. The X-ray gas coincident with the H-alpha filament has been measured
to be cooling spectroscopically at a rate of ~ 1 Solar Masses/ yr, consistent with measurements of
the star formation rate in this region as inferred from UV observations, suggesting that the star
formation in this filament as inferred by its H$\alpha$ and UV emission can trace its origin to the
rapid cooling of dense, X-ray emitting gas. The H-alpha filament is not a unique site of cooler ICM,
however, as ICM at similar temperatures and even higher metallicities not cospatial with H$\alpha$
emission is observed just to the west of the H-alpha filament, suggesting that it may have been uplifted
by Abell 1795's central active galaxy. Further simulations of cool core sloshing and AGN feedback
operating in concert with one another will be necessary to understand how such a dynamic cool core
region may have originated and why the H-alpha emission is so localized with respect to the cool X-ray
gas despite the evidence for a catastrophic cooling flow.
