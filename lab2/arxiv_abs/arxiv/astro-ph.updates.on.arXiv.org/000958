From chemical abundance analysis of stars in the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr), we
conclude that the alpha-element deficiencies cannot be due to the Type Ia supernova (SNIa) time-delay
scenario of Tinsley (1979). Instead, the evidence points to low [alpha/Fe] ratios resulting from
an initial mass function (IMF) deficient in the highest mass stars. The critical evidence is the
0.4 dex deficiency of [O/Fe], [Mg/Fe] and other hydrostatic elements, contrasting with the normal
trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]r with [Fe/H]. Supporting evidence comes from the hydrostatic element
(O, Mg, Na, Al, Cu) [X/Fe] ratios, which are inconsistent with iron added to the Milky Way (MW) disk
trends. Also, the ratio of hydrostatic to explosive (Si, Ca, Ti) element abundances suggests a relatively
top-light IMF. Abundance similarities with the LMC, Fornax and IC 1613, suggest that their alpha-element
deficiencies also resulted from IMFs lacking the most massive SNII. For such a top-light IMF, the
normal trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]r with [Fe/H], as seen in Sgr, indicates that massive Type II supernovae
(>30Msun) cannot be major sources of r-process elements. High [La/Y] ratios, consistent with
leaky-box chemical evolution, are confirmed but ~0.3 dex larger than theoretical AGB predictions.
This may be due to the 13C pocket mass, or a difference between MW and Sgr AGB stars. Sgr has the lowest
[Rb/Zr] ratios known, consistent with low-mass (~2Msun) AGB stars near [Fe/H]=-0.6, likely resulting
from leaky-box chemical evolution. The [Cu/O] trend in Sgr and the MW suggest that Cu yields increase
with both metallicity and stellar mass, as expected from Cu production by the weak s-process in massive
stars. Finally, we present an updated hfs line list, an abundance analysis of Arcturus, and further
develop our error analysis formalism.
