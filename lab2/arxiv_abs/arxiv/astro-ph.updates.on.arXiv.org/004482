Recent observations found that electrons are accelerated to $\sim$10 GeV and emit synchrotron
hard X-rays in two magnetic white dwarfs (WDs), also known as cataclysmic variables (CVs). In nova
outbursts of WDs, multi-GeV gamma-rays were detected inferring that protons are accelerated to
100 GeV or higher. In recent optical surveys, the WD density is found to be higher near the Sun than
in the Galactic disk by a factor $\sim$2.5. The cosmic rays (CR) produced by local CVs and novae will
accumulate in the local bubble for $10^6$ - $10^7$ yrs. On these findings, we search for CRs from historic
CVs and novae in the observed CR spectra. We model the CR spectra at the heliopause as sums of Galactic
and local components based on observational data as much as possible. The initial Galactic CR electron
and proton spectra are deduced from the gamma-ray emissivity, the local electron spectrum from
the hard X-ray spectra at the CVs, and the local proton spectrum inferred by gamma-ray spectrum at
novae. These spectral shapes are then expressed in a simple set of polynomial functions of CR energy
and regressively fitted until the high-energy ($>$100 GeV) CR spectra near Earth and the Voyager-1
spectra at the heliopause are reproduced. We then extend the modeling to nuclear CR spectra and find
that one spectral shape fits all local nuclear CRs and the apparent hardening of the nuclear CR spectra
is caused by the roll-down of local nuclear spectra around 100 - 200 GeV. All local CR spectra populate
in a limited energy band below 100 - 200 GeV and enhance gamma-ray emissivity below $\sim$10 GeV.
Such an enhancement is observed in the inner Galaxy, suggesting the CR fluxes from CVs and novae are
substantially higher there.
