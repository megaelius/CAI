The origin and survival of the Smith high-velocity HI cloud has so far defied explanation. This object
has several remarkable properties: (i) its prograde orbit is ~100 km/s faster than the underlying
Galactic rotation; (ii) its total gas mass ($\gtrsim 4 \times 10^6 ~{\rm M}_{\odot}$) exceeds the
mass of all other high-velocity clouds (HVC) outside of the Magellanic Stream; (iii) its head-tail
morphology extends to the Galactic HI disc, indicating some sort of interaction. The Smith Cloud's
kinetic energy rules out models based on ejection from the disc. We construct a dynamically self-consistent,
multi-phase model of the Galaxy with a view to exploring whether the Smith Cloud can be understood
in terms of an infalling, compact HVC that has transited the Galactic disc. We show that while a dark-matter
(DM) free HVC of sufficient mass and density can reach the disc, it does not survive the transit. The
most important ingredient to survival during a transit is a confining DM subhalo around the cloud;
radiative gas cooling and high spatial resolution ($\lesssim$ 10 pc) are also essential. In our
model, the cloud develops a head-tail morphology within ~10 Myr before and after its first disc crossing;
after the event, the tail is left behind and accretes onto the disc within ~400 Myr. In our interpretation,
the Smith Cloud corresponds to a gas 'streamer' that detaches, falls back and fades after the DM subhalo,
distorted by the disc passage, has moved on. We conclude that subhalos with ${\rm M}_{\rm DM} \lesssim
10^9 ~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ have accreted $\sim10^9 ~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ of gas into the Galaxy over cosmic
time - a small fraction of the total baryon budget.
