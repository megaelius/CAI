NGC 2359 is an HII region located in the outer Galaxy that contains the isolated Wolf-Rayet (WR) star
HD 56925. We present new CO observations of NGC 2359 with the Nobeyama 45 m radio telescope and the
Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment using the $^{12}$CO($J$ = 1-0, 3-2) emission lines
and compare them with archived HI and radio-continuum data from the Very Large Array. Our purpose
is to investigate whether the formation of the WR star in NGC 2359 was triggered by a cloud-cloud collision.
We find two molecular clouds at $\sim$37 and $\sim$54 km s$^{-1}$, and two HI clouds at $\sim$54 and
$\sim$63 km s$^{-1}$. All are likely to be associated with NGC 2359 as suggested by good morphological
correspondence not only with an optical dark lane through the nebula but also with the radio-shell
boundary. We also find that the molecular cloud at $\sim$54 km s$^{-1}$ has a high kinematic temperature
of at least $\sim$40 K, thus indicating that the gas temperature has been increased because of heating
by the WR star. We propose that both NGC 2359 and the isolated WR star were created by a collision between
the two molecular clouds. The supersonic velocity separation of the two clouds cannot be explained
by stellar feedback from the WR star. The complementary spatial distributions and bridging features
of CO and HI also are in good agreement with the expected observational signatures of high-mass star
formations triggered by cloud-cloud collisions. We argue that NGC 2359 may be in the final phase
of a cloud-cloud collision and that the collision timescale is $\sim$1.5 Myr or longer. We also note
that there is no significant difference between the physical properties of colliding clouds that
trigger the formation of isolated O-type and WR stars.
