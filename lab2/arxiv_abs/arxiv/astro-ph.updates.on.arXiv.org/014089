This is the first paper in a series devoted to review the main properties of galaxies designated S0
in the Hubble classification system. Our aim is to gather abundant and, above all, robust information
on the most relevant physical parameters of this poorly-understood morphological type and their
possible dependence on the environment that could later be used to assess their possible formation
channel(s). The adopted approach combines the characterisation of the fundamental features of
the optical spectra of $68{,}043$ S0 with heliocentric $z\lesssim 0.1$ with the exploration of
a comprehensive set of their global attributes. A principal component analysis is used to reduce
the huge number of dimensions of the spectral data to a low-dimensional space facilitating a bias-free
machine-learning-based classification of the galaxies. This procedure has revealed that objects
bearing the S0 designation consist, despite their similar morphology, of two separate sub-populations
with statistically inconsistent physical properties. Compared to the absorption-dominated
S0, those with significant nebular emission are, on average, somewhat less massive, more luminous
with less concentrated light profiles, have a younger, bluer and metal-poorer stellar component,
and avoid high-galaxy-density regions. Noteworthy is the fact that the majority of members of this
latter class, which accounts for at least a quarter of the local S0 population, show star formation
rates and spectral characteristics entirely similar to those seen in late spirals. Our findings
suggest that star-forming S0 might be less rare than hitherto believed and raise the interesting
possibility of identifying them with plausible progenitors of their quiescent counterparts.
