We present the results of a new search for bright star-forming galaxies at z ~ 7 within the UltraVISTA
DR2 and UKIDSS UDS DR10 data, which together provide 1.65 sq deg of near-infrared imaging with overlapping
optical and Spitzer data. Using a full photo-z analysis to identify high-z galaxies and reject contaminants,
we have selected a sample of 34 luminous (-22.7 < M_UV < -21.2) galaxies with 6.5 < z <
7.5. Crucially, the deeper imaging provided by UltraVISTA DR2 confirms all of the robust objects
previously uncovered by Bowler et al. (2012), validating our selection technique. Our sample includes
the most massive galaxies known at z ~ 7, with M_* ~ 10^{10} M_sun, and the majority are resolved, consistent
with larger sizes (r_{1/2} ~ 1 - 1.5 kpc) than displayed by less massive galaxies. From our final sample,
we determine the form of the bright end of the rest-frame UV galaxy luminosity function (LF) at z ~
7, providing strong evidence that the bright end of the z = 7 LF does not decline as steeply as predicted
by the Schechter function fitted to fainter data. We consider carefully, and exclude the possibility
that this is due to either gravitational lensing, or significant contamination of our galaxy sample
by AGN. Rather, our results favour a double power-law form for the galaxy LF at high z, or, more interestingly,
a LF which simply follows the form of the dark-matter halo mass function at bright magnitudes. This
suggests that the physical mechanism which inhibits star-formation activity in massive galaxies
(i.e. AGN feedback or some other form of `mass quenching') has yet to impact on the observable galaxy
LF at z ~ 7, a conclusion supported by the estimated masses of our brightest galaxies which have only
just reached a mass comparable to the critical `quenching mass' of M_* = 10 ^{10.2} M_sun derived
from studies of the mass function of star-forming galaxies at lower z.
