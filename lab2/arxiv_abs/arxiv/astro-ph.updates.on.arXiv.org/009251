Using {\sl Gaia} Data Release 2 photometry, we report the detection of extended main-sequence turnoff
(eMSTO) regions in the color--magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of the $\sim 14$ Myr-old double clusters
$h$ and $\chi$ Persei (NGC 869 and NGC 884). We find that stars with masses below $\sim$1.3 $M_{\odot}$
in both $h$ and $\chi$ Persei populate narrow main sequences (MSs), while more massive stars define
the eMSTO, closely mimicking observations of young Galactic and Magellanic Cloud clusters (with
ages older than $\sim$30 Myr). Previous studies based on clusters older than $\sim$30 Myr find that
rapidly rotating MS stars are redder than slow rotators of similar luminosity, suggesting that
stellar rotation may be the main driver of the eMSTO. By combining photometry and projected rotational
velocities from the literature of stars in $h$ and $\chi$ Persei, we find no obvious relation between
the rotational velocities and colors of non-emission-line eMSTO stars, in contrast with what is
observed in older clusters. Similarly to what is observed in Magellanic Cloud clusters, most of
the extremely rapidly rotating stars, identified by their strong H$\alpha$ emission lines, are
located in the red part of the eMSTOs. This indicates that stellar rotation plays a role in the color
and magnitude distribution of MSTO stars. By comparing the observations with simulated CMDs, we
find that a simple population composed of coeval stars that span a wide range of rotation rates is
unable to reproduce the color spread of the clusters' MSs. We suggest that variable stars, binary
interactions, and stellar rotation affect the eMSTO morphology of these very young clusters.
