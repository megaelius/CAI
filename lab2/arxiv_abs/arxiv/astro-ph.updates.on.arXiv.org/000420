This study aims to determine the impact of stellar binary companions on the lifetime and evolution
of circumstellar disks in the Chamaeleon I (Cha I) star-forming region by measuring the frequency
and strength of accretion and circumstellar dust signatures around the individual components
of T Tauri binary stars. We used high-angular resolution adaptive optics JHKL'-band photometry
and 1.5-2.5mu spectroscopy of 19 visual binary and 7 triple stars in Cha I - including one newly discovered
tertiary component - with separations between ~25 and ~1000au. The data allowed us to infer stellar
component masses and ages and, from the detection of near-infrared excess emission and the strength
of Brackett-gamma emission, the presence of ongoing accretion and hot circumstellar dust of the
individual stellar component of each binary. Of all the stellar components in close binaries with
separations of 25-100au, 10(+15-5)% show signs of accretion. This is less than half of the accretor
fraction found in wider binaries, which itself appears significantly reduced (~44%) compared
with previous measurements of single stars in Cha I. Hot dust was found around 50(+30-15)% of the
target components, a value that is indistinguishable from that of Cha I single stars. Only the closest
binaries (<25au) were inferred to have a significantly reduced fraction (<~25%) of components
that harbor hot dust. Accretors were exclusively found in binary systems with unequal component
masses M_secondary/M_primary < 0.8, implying that the detected accelerated disk dispersal
is a function of mass-ratio. This agrees with the finding that only one accreting secondary star
was found, which is also the weakest accretor in the sample. The results imply that disk dispersal
is more accelerated the stronger the dynamical disk truncation, i.e., the smaller the inferred
radius of the disk. (abridged)
