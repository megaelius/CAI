We construct a theoretical framework to study Population III (Pop III) star formation in the post-reionization
epoch ($z\lesssim 6$) by combining cosmological simulation data with semi-analytical models.
We find that due to radiative feedback (i.e. Lyman-Werner and ionizing radiation) massive haloes
($M_{\rm halo}\gtrsim 10^{9}\ \rm M_{\odot}$) are the major ($\gtrsim 90$\%) hosts for potential
Pop III star formation at $z\lesssim 6$, where dense pockets of metal-poor gas may survive to form
Pop III stars, under inefficient mixing of metals released by supernovae. Metal mixing is the key
process that determines not only when Pop III star formation ends, but also the total mass, $M_{\rm
PopIII}$, of \textit{active} Pop III stars per host halo, which is a crucial parameter for direct
detection and identification of Pop III hosts. Both aspects are still uncertain due to our limited
knowledge of metal mixing during structure formation. Current predictions range from early termination
at the end of reionization ($z\sim 5$) to continuous Pop III star formation extended to $z=0$ at a
non-negligible rate $\sim 10^{-7}\ \rm M_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}\ Mpc^{-3}$, with $M_{\rm PopIII}\sim
10^{3}-10^{6}\ \rm M_{\odot}$. This leads to a broad range of redshift limits for direct detection
of Pop III hosts, $z_{\rm PopIII}\sim 0.5-12.5$, with detection rates $\lesssim 0.1-20\ \rm arcmin^{-2}$,
for current and future space telescopes (e.g. HST, WFIRST and JWST). Our model also predicts that
the majority ($\gtrsim 90$\%) of the cosmic volume is occupied by metal-free gas. Measuring the
volume filling fractions of this metal-free phase can constrain metal mixing parameters and Pop
III star formation.
