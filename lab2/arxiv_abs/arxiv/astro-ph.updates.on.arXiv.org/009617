We report the discovery of a radio transient in the spiral galaxy M81. The transient was detected
in early 2015 as part of a two-year survey of M81 made up of 12 epochs using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
Array. While undetected on 2014 September 12, the source was first detected on 2015 January 2, from
which point it remained visible at an approximately constant luminosity of $L_{R} = 1.5 \pm 0.1 \times
10^{24}$erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ at the observing frequency of 6 GHz for at least 2 months. Assuming
this is a synchrotron event with a rise-time between 2.6 and 112 days, the peak luminosity (at equipartition)
corresponds to a minimum energy of $10^{44} \lesssim E_{min} \lesssim 10^{46}$erg and jet power
of $P_{min} \sim 10^{39}$erg s$^{-1}$, which are higher than most known X-ray binaries. Given its
longevity, lack of short-term radio variability, and the absence of any multi-wavelength counterpart
(X-ray luminosity $L_{X} \lesssim 10^{36}$erg s$^{-1}$), it does not behave like known Galactic
or extragalactic X-ray binaries. The M81 transient radio properties more closely resemble the
unidentified radio transient 43.78+59.3 discovered in M82, which has been suggested to be a radio
nebula associated with an accreting source similar to SS 433. One possibility is that both the new
M81 transient and the M82 transient may be the birth of a short-lived radio bubble associated with
a discrete accretion event similar to those observed from the ULX Holmberg II X-1. However, it is
not possible to rule out other identifications including long-term supernova shockwave interactions
with the surrounding medium from a faint supernova or a background active galaxy.
