We report on the timing observations of the millisecond pulsar PSR J2055+3829 originally discovered
as part of the SPAN512 survey conducted with the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Telescope. The pulsar has a rotational
period of 2.089 ms, and is in a tight 3.1 hr orbit around a very low mass ($0.023 \leq m_c \lesssim 0.053$
M$_\odot$, 90\% c.l.) companion. Our 1.4 GHz observations reveal the presence of eclipses of the
pulsar's radio signal caused by the outflow of material from the companion, for a few minutes around
superior conjunction of the pulsar. The very low companion mass, the observation of radio eclipses,
and the detection of time variations of the orbital period establish PSR J2055+3829 as a `black widow'
(BW) pulsar. Inspection of the radio signal from the pulsar during ingress and egress phases shows
that the eclipses in PSR J2055+3829 are asymmetric and variable, as is commonly observed in other
similar systems. More generally, the orbital properties of the new pulsar are found to be very similar
to those of other known eclipsing BW pulsars. No gamma-ray source is detected at the location of the
pulsar in recent \textit{Fermi}-LAT source catalogs. We used the timing ephemeris to search ten
years of \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT) data for gamma-ray pulsations, but were unable
to detect any, possibly because of the pulsar's large distance. We finally compared the mass functions
of eclipsing and non-eclipsing BW pulsars and confirmed previous findings that eclipsing BWs have
higher mass functions than their non-eclipsing counterparts. Larger inclinations could explain
the higher mass functions of eclipsing BWs. On the other hand, the mass function distributions of
Galactic disk and globular cluster BWs appear to be consistent, suggesting, despite the very different
environments, the existence of common mechanisms taking place in the last stages of evolution of
BWs.
