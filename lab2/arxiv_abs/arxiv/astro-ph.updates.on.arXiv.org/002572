The positron fraction in cosmic rays was found to be a steadily increasing in function of energy,
above $\sim$ 10 GeV. This behaviour is in tension with standard astrophysical mechanisms, in which
positrons are secondary particles, produced in the interactions of primary cosmic rays during
the propagation in the interstellar medium. The observed anomaly in the positron fraction triggered
a lot of excitement, as it could be interpreted as an indirect signature of the presence of dark matter
species in the Galaxy. Alternatively, it could be produced by nearby astrophysical sources, such
as pulsars. Both hypotheses are probed in this work in light of the latest AMS-02 positron fraction
measurements. The transport of the primary and secondary positrons in the Galaxy is described using
a semi-analytic two-zone model. MicrOMEGAs is used to model the positron flux generated by dark
matter species. The description of the positron fraction from astrophysical sources is based on
the pulsar observations included in the ATNF catalogue. We find that the mass of the favoured dark
matter candidates is always larger than 500 GeV. The only dark matter species that fulfils the numerous
gamma ray and cosmic microwave background bounds is a particle annihilating into four leptons through
a light scalar or vector mediator, with a mixture of tau (75%) and electron (25%) channels, and a mass
between 0.5 and 1 TeV. The positron anomaly can also be explained by a single astrophysical source
and a list of five pulsars from the ATNF catalogue is given. Those results are obtained with the cosmic
ray transport parameters which best fit the B/C ratio. Uncertainties in the propagation parameters
turn out to be very significant. In the WIMP annihilation cross section to mass plane for instance,
they overshadow the error contours derived from the positron data.
