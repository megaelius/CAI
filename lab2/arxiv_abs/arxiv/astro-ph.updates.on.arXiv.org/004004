We present the results of a photometric study of 85 objects from the updated sample of galaxies residing
in the nearby Lynx--Cancer void. We perform our photometry on u, g, r, and i-band images of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. We determine model-independent galaxy parameters such as the integrated magnitudes
and colors, effective radii and the corresponding surface brightness values, optical radii and
Holmberg radii. We analyze the radial surface brightness profiles to determine the central brightness
values and scale lengths of the model discs. We analyze the colors of the outer parts of the galaxies
and compare them with model evolutionary tracks computed using the PEGASE2 software package. This
allowed us to estimate the time T_SF elapsed since the onset of star formation, which turned out to
be on the order of the cosmological time T_0 for the overwhelming majority of the galaxies studied.
However, for 13 galaxies of the sample the time T_SF does not exceed T_0/2 ~ 7 Gyr, and for 7 of them T_SF
< 3.5 Gyr. The latter are mostly unevolved objects dominated by low-luminosity galaxies with M_B
> -13.2. We use the integrated magnitudes and colors to estimate the stellar masses of the galaxies.
We estimate the parameter M(HI)/L_B and the gas mass fractions for void galaxies with known HI-line
fluxes. A small subgroup (about 10%) of the gas-richest void galaxies with M(HI)/L_B > 2.5 has gas
mass fractions that reach 94-99%. The outer regions of many of these galaxies show atypically blue
colors. To test various statistical differences between void galaxies and galaxies from the samples
selected using more general criteria, we compare some of the parameters of void galaxies with similar
data for the sample of 195 galaxies from the Equatorial Survey (ES) based on a part of the HIPASS blind
HI survey. abridged
