Obtaining accurate distributions of galaxy redshifts is a critical aspect of weak lensing cosmology
experiments. One of the methods used to estimate and validate redshift distributions is apply weights
to a spectroscopic sample so that their weighted photometry distribution matches the target sample.
In this work we estimate the \textit{selection bias} in redshift that is introduced in this procedure.
We do so by simulating the process of assembling a spectroscopic sample (including observer-assigned
confidence flags) and highlight the impacts of spectroscopic target selection and redshift failures.
We use the first year (Y1) weak lensing analysis in DES as an example data set but the implications
generalise to all similar weak lensing surveys. We find that using colour cuts that are not available
to the weak lensing galaxies can introduce biases of $\Delta~z\sim0.015$ in the weighted mean redshift
of different redshift intervals. To assess the impact of incompleteness in spectroscopic samples,
we select only objects with high observer-defined confidence flags and compare the weighted mean
redshift with the true mean. We find that the mean redshift of the DES Y1 weak lensing sample is typically
biased at the $\Delta~z=0.005-0.05$ level after the weighting is applied. The bias we uncover can
have either sign, depending on the samples and redshift interval considered. For the highest redshift
bin, the bias is larger than the uncertainties in the other DES Y1 redshift calibration methods,
justifying the decision of not using this method for the redshift estimations. We discuss several
methods to mitigate this bias.
