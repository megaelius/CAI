Using N-body simulations, we study the properties of a bar induced in a dwarf galaxy as a result of
tidal interaction with the Milky Way. The dwarf is initially composed of a disk embedded in a dark
matter halo and we follow its evolution on a typical orbit for 10 Gyr. It undergoes an evolution typical
of tidally stirred dwarf galaxies: it loses mass, the stellar component transforms from a disk to
a spheroid and the rotation of the stars is partially replaced by random motions. A tidally induced
bar forms at the first pericentre passage and survives until the end of the evolution. Fourier decomposition
of the distribution of stars reveals that only even modes are significant and preserve a hierarchy
so that the bar mode is always the strongest. They show a characteristic profile with a maximum, similar
to simulated bars forming in isolated galaxies and observed bars in real galaxies. We adopt the maximum
of the bar mode as a measure of the bar strength and we estimate the bar length by comparing the density
profiles along the bar and perpendicular to it. Both the bar strength and the bar length decrease
with time, mainly at pericentres, as a result of tidal torques acting at those times and not to secular
evolution. The pattern speed of the bar varies significantly on a time scale of 1 Gyr and seems to be
fully controlled by the orientation of the tidal torque from the Milky Way. The bar is never tidally
locked but we discover a hint of a 5/2 orbital resonance between the third and fourth pericentre passage.
The speed of the bar expressed in terms of the ratio of the bar length to the corotation radius decreases
in the long run so that the bar changes from initially rather fast to slow in the later stages. The boxy/peanut
shape is clearly visible in the edge-on view between the second and third pericentre and its occurrence
is preceded by a short period of buckling instability.
