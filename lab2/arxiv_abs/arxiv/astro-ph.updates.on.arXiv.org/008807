The brightness of the emission from coronal loops in the solar atmosphere is strongly dependent
on the temperature and density of the confined plasma. After a release of energy, these loops undergo
a heating and upflow phase, followed by a cooling and downflow cycle. Throughout, there are significant
variations in the properties of the coronal plasma. In particular, the increased coronal temperature
leads to an excess downward heat flux that the transition region is unable to radiate. This generates
an enthalpy flux from the transition region to the corona, increasing the coronal density. The enthalpy
exchange is highly sensitive to the transition region resolution in numerical simulations. With
a numerically under-resolved transition region, major errors occur in simulating the coronal
density evolution and, thus, the predicted loop emission. This Letter presents a new method that
addresses the difficulty of obtaining the correct interaction between the corona and corona/chromosphere
interface. In the transition region, an adaptive thermal conduction approach is used that broadens
any unresolved parts of the atmosphere. We show that this approach, referred to as TRAC, successfully
removes the influence of numerical resolution on the coronal density response to heating while
maintaining high levels of agreement with fully resolved models. When employed with coarse spatial
resolutions, typically achieved in multi-dimensional MHD codes, the peak density errors are less
than 3% and the computation time is three orders of magnitude faster than fully resolved field-aligned
models. The advantages of using TRAC in field-aligned hydrodynamic and multi-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic
simulations are discussed.
