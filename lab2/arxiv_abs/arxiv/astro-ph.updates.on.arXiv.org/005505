We present a sample of 34 weak metal line absorbers at $z< 0.3$ complied via the simultaneous detections
($3\sigma$) of the SiII$\lambda1260$ and CII$\lambda1334$ absorption lines, with $W_{r}$(SiII)$<0.2$
\AA\ and $W_{r}$(CII)$<0.3$ \AA, in archival HST/COS spectra. Our sample increases the number
of known low-$z$ "weak absorbers" by a factor of $>5$. The column densities of HI and low-ionization
metal lines obtained from Voigt profile fitting are used to build simple photoionization models
using CLOUDY. The inferred densities and total hydrogen column densities are in the ranges of $-3.3
< \log n_{\rm H}/{\rm cm^{-3}} < -2.4$ and $16.0 < \log N_{\rm H}/{\rm cm^{-2}}<20.3$, respectively.
The line of sight thicknesses of the absorbers have a wide range of $\sim$1 pc$-$50 kpc with a median
value of $\sim$500 pc. The high-ionization OVI absorption, detected in 12/18 cases, always stems
from a different gas-phase. Most importantly, 85% (50%) of these absorbers show a metallicity of
$\rm [Si/H] > -1.0$ (0.0). The fraction of systems showing high metallicity (i.e., $\rm [Si/H]>-1.0$)
in our sample is significantly higher than the HI-selected sample (Wotta et al. 2016) and the galaxy-selected
sample (Prochaska et al. 2017) of absorbers probing the circum-galactic medium (CGM) at similar
redshift. A search for galaxies has revealed a significant galaxy-overdensity around these weak
absorbers compared to random places with a median impact parameter of 166 kpc to the nearest galaxy.
Moreover, we find the presence of multiple galaxies in $\sim80$% of the cases, suggesting group
environments. The observed $d\mathcal{N}/dz$ of $0.8\pm0.2$ indicates that such metal-enriched,
compact, dense structures are ubiquitous in the halos of low-$z$ galaxies that are in groups. We
suggest that these are transient structures that are related to outflows and/or stripping of metal-rich
gas from galaxies.
