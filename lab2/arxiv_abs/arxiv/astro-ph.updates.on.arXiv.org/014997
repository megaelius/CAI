In this dissertation, we estimate the population of different classes of BNS systems that are visible
to gravitational-wave observatories. Given that no ultra-compact BNS systems have been discovered
in pulsar radio surveys, we place a 95\% confidence upper limit of $\sim$850 and $\sim$1100 ultra-compact
neutron star--white dwarf and double neutron star (DNS) systems that are beaming towards the Earth,
respectively. We show that among all of the current radio pulsar surveys, the ones at the Arecibo
radio telescope have the best chance of detecting an ultra-compact BNS system. We also show that
adopting a survey integration time of $t_{\rm int} \sim 1$~min will maximize the signal-to-noise
ratio, and thus, the probability of detecting an ultra-compact BNS system. Similarly, we use the
sample of nine observed DNS systems to derive a Galactic DNS merger rate of $\mathcal{R}_{\rm MW}
= 37^{+24}_{-11}$~Myr$^{-1}$, where the errors represent 90\% confidence intervals. Extrapolating
this rate to the observable volume for LIGO, we derive a merger detection rate of $\mathcal{R} = 1.9^{+1.2}_{-0.6}
\times \left(D_{\rm r}/100 \ \rm Mpc \right)^3 \rm yr^{-1}$, where $D_{\rm r}$ is the range distance
for LIGO. This rate is consistent with that derived using the DNS mergers observed by LIGO. Finally,
we measure the sense of rotation of the older millisecond pulsar, pulsar A, in the DNS J0737--3039
system and find that it rotates prograde with respect to its orbit. This is the first direct measurement
of the sense of rotation of a pulsar and a direct confirmation of the rotating lighthouse model for
pulsars. This result confirms that the spin angular momentum vector is closely aligned with the
orbital angular momentum, suggesting that kick of the supernova producing the second born pulsar
J0737--3039B was small.
