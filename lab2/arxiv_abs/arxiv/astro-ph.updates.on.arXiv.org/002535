In this paper, we test the age matching hypothesis that the star formation rate (SFR) of a galaxy of
fixed stellar mass is determined by its dark matter halo formation history, and as such, that more
quiescent galaxies reside in older halos. This simple model has been remarkably successful at predicting
color-based galaxy statistics at low redshift as measured in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
To further test this method with observations, we present new SDSS measurements of the galaxy two-point
correlation function and galaxy-galaxy lensing as a function of stellar mass and SFR, separated
into quenched and star-forming galaxy samples. We find that our age matching model is in excellent
agreement with these new measurements. We also employ a galaxy group finder and show that our model
is able to predict: (1) the relative SFRs of central and satellite galaxies, (2) the SFR-dependence
of the radial distribution of satellite galaxy populations within galaxy groups, rich groups,
and clusters and their surrounding larger scale environments, and (3) the interesting feature
that the satellite quenched fraction as a function of projected radial distance from the central
galaxy exhibits an ~ r^-.15 slope, independent of environment. The accurate prediction for the
spatial distribution of satellites is intriguing given the fact that we do not explicitly model
satellite-specific processes after infall, and that in our model the virial radius does not mark
a special transition region in the evolution of a satellite, contrary to most galaxy evolution models.
The success of the model suggests that present-day galaxy SFR is strongly correlated with halo mass
assembly history.
