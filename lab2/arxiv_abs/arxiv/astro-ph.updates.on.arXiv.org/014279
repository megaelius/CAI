In stratified atmospheres, acoustic waves can only propagate if their frequency is above the cutoff
value. Different theories provide different cutoff values. We developed an alternative method
to derive the cutoff frequency in several standard solar models, including various quiet-Sun and
umbral atmospheres. We performed numerical simulations of wave propagation in the solar atmosphere.
The cutoff frequency is determined from the inspection of phase difference spectra computed between
the velocity signal at two atmospheric heights. The process is performed by choosing pairs of heights
across all the layers between the photosphere and the chromosphere, to derive the vertical stratification
of the cutoff in the solar models. The cutoff frequency predicted by the theoretical calculations
departs significantly from our measurements. In quiet-Sun atmospheres, the cutoff shows a strong
dependence on the magnetic field for adiabatic wave propagation. When radiative losses are taken
into account, the cutoff frequency is greatly reduced and the variation of the cutoff with the strength
of the magnetic field is lower. The effect of the radiative losses in the cutoff is necessary to understand
recent quiet-Sun and sunspot observations. In the presence of inclined magnetic fields, our numerical
calculations confirm the reduction of the cutoff frequency due to the reduced gravity experienced
by waves propagating along field lines. An additional reduction is also found in regions with significant
changes in the temperature, due to the lower temperature gradient along the path of field-guided
waves. Our results show that the cutoff values are not correctly captured by theoretical estimates.
In addition, most of the widely-used analytical cutoff formulae neglect the impact of magnetic
fields and radiative losses, whose role is critical to determine the evanescent or propagating
nature of the waves.
