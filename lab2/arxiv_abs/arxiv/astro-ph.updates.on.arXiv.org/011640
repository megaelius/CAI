We present COSMIC BIRTH: COSMological Initial Conditions from Bayesian Inference Reconstructions
with THeoretical models: an algorithm to reconstruct the primordial and evolved cosmic density
fields from galaxy surveys on the light-cone. The displacement and peculiar velocity fields are
obtained from forward modelling at different redshift snapshots given some initial cosmic density
field within a Gibbs-sampling scheme. This allows us to map galaxies, observed in a light-cone,
to a single high redshift and hereby provide tracers and the corresponding survey completeness
in Lagrangian space including phase-space mapping. These Lagrangian tracers in turn permit us
to efficiently obtain the primordial density field, making the COSMIC BIRTH code general to any
structure formation model. Our tests are restricted for the time being to Augmented Lagrangian
Perturbation theory. We show how to robustly compute the non-linear Lagrangian bias from clustering
measurements in a numerical way, enabling us to get unbiased dark matter field reconstructions
at initial cosmic times. We also show that we can greatly recover the information of the dark matter
field from the galaxy distribution based on a detailed simulation. Novel key ingredients to this
approach are a higher order Hamiltonian sampling technique and a non-diagonal Hamiltonian mass-matrix.
This technique could be used to study the Eulerian galaxy bias from galaxy surveys and could become
an ideal baryon acoustic reconstruction technique. In summary, this method represents a general
reconstruction technique, including in a self-consistent way a survey mask, non-linear and non-local
bias and redshift space distortions, with an efficiency about 20 times superior to previous comparable
methods.
