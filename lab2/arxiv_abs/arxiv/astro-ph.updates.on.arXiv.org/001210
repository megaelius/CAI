The problem of reproducing dark energy effects is reviewed here with particular interest devoted
to cosmography. We summarize some of the most relevant cosmological models, based on the assumption
that the corresponding barotropic equations of state evolve as the universe expands, giving rise
to the accelerated expansion. We describe in detail the $\Lambda$CDM ($\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter)
and $\omega$CDM models, considering also some specific examples, e.g., Chevallier-Polarsky-Linder,
the Chaplygin gas and the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati cosmological model. Finally, we consider the
cosmological consequences of $f(\mathcal{R})$ and $f(\mathcal{T})$ gravities and their impact
on the framework of cosmography. Keeping these considerations in mind, we point out the \emph{model-independent}
procedure related to cosmography, showing how to match the series of cosmological observables
to the free parameters of each model. We critically discuss the role played by cosmography, as a \emph{selection
criterion} to check whether a particular model passes or does not present cosmological constraints.
In so doing, we find out cosmological bounds by fitting the luminosity distance expansion of the
redshift, z, adopting the recent Union 2.1 dataset of supernovae, combined with the baryonic acoustic
oscillation and the cosmic microwave background measurements. We perform cosmographic analyses,
imposing different priors on the Hubble rate present value. In addition, we compare our results
with recent PLANCK limits, showing that the $\Lambda$CDM and $\omega$CDM models seem to be the favorite
with respect to other dark energy models. However, we show that cosmographic constraints on $f(\mathcal{R})$
and $f(\mathcal{T})$ cannot discriminate between extensions of General Relativity and dark energy
models, leading to a disadvantageous degeneracy problem.
