While the formation of stellar clumps in distant galaxies is usually attributed to gravitational
violent disk instabilities, we show here that major mergers also represent a competitive mechanism
to form bright clumps. Using ~0.1'' resolution ACS F814W images in the entire COSMOS field, we measure
the fraction of clumpy emission in 109 main sequence (MS) and 79 Herschel-detected starbursts (off-MS)
galaxies at 0.5 < z < 0.9, representative of normal versus merger induced star-forming activity,
respectively. We additionally identify merger samples from visual inspection and from Gini-M20
morphological parameters. Regardless of the merger criteria adopted, the clumpiness distribution
of merging systems is different from that of normal isolated disks at > 99.5 % confidence level, with
the former reaching higher clumpiness values, up to 20 % of the total galaxy emission. We confirm
the merger induced clumpiness enhancement with novel hydrodynamical simulations of colliding
galaxies with gas fractions typical of z ~ 0.7. Multi-wavelength images of three starbursts in the
CANDELS field support the young nature of clumps, which are likely merger products rather than older
pre-existing structures. Finally, for a subset of 19 starbursts with existing near-IR rest frame
spectroscopy, we find that the clumpiness is mildly anti-correlated with the merger phase, decreasing
towards final coalescence. Our result can explain recent ALMA detections of clumps in hyperluminous
high-z starbursts, while normal objects are smooth. This work raises a question on the role of mergers
on the origin of clumps in high redshift galaxies in general.
