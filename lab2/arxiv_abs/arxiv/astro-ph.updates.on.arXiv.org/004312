The central ambition of the modern time delay cosmography consists in determining the Hubble constant
$H_0$ with a competitive precision. However, the tension with $H_0$ obtained from the Planck satellite
for a spatially-flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology suggests that systematic errors may have been underestimated.
The most critical one probably comes from the degeneracy existing between lens models that was first
formalized by the well-known mass-sheet transformation (MST). In this paper, we assess to what
extent the source position transformation (SPT), a more general invariance transformation which
contains the MST as a special case, may affect the time delays predicted by a model. To this aim we use
pySPT, a new open-source python package fully dedicated to the SPT that we present in a companion
paper. For axisymmetric lenses, we find that the time delay ratios between a model and its SPT-modified
counterpart simply scale like the corresponding source position ratios, $\Delta \hat{t}/ \Delta
t \approx \hat{\beta}/\beta$, regardless of the mass profile and the isotropic SPT. Similar behavior
(almost) holds for non-axisymmetric lenses in the double image regime and for opposite image pairs
in the quadruple image regime. In the latter regime, we also confirm that the time delay ratios are
not conserved. In addition to the MST effects, the SPT-modified time delays deviate in general no
more than a few percent for particular image pairs, suggesting that its impact on time-delay cosmography
seems not be as crucial as initially suspected. We also reflected upon the relevance of the SPT validity
criterion and present arguments suggesting that it should be reconsidered. Even though a new validity
criterion would affect the time delays in a different way, we expect from numerical simulations
that our conclusions will remain unchanged.
