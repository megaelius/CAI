Exploiting a sample of galaxies drawn from the XXL-N multiwavelength survey, we present an analysis
of the stellar population properties of galaxies at 0.1<z<0.5, by studying galaxy fractions and
the star formation rate (SFR)-stellar mass(M) relation. Furthermore, we exploit and compare two
parametrisations of environment. When adopting a definition of "global" environment, we consider
separately cluster virial/outer members and field galaxies. When considering the "local" environment,
we take into account the projected number density of galaxies in a fixed aperture of 1Mpc in the sky.
We find that regardless of the environmental definition adopted, the fraction of blue/star-forming
galaxies is the highest in the field/least dense regions and the lowest in the virial regions of clusters/highest
densities. Furthermore, the fraction of star-forming galaxies is higher than the fraction of blue
galaxies, regardless of the environment. This result is particularly evident in the virial cluster
regions, most likely reflecting the different star formation histories of galaxies in different
environments. Also the overall SFR-M relation does not seem to depend on the parametrisation adopted.
Nonetheless, the two definitions of environment lead to different results as far as the fraction
of galaxies in transition between the star-forming main sequence and the quenched regime is concerned.
In fact, using the local environment the fraction of galaxies below the main sequence is similar
at low and high densities, whereas in clusters (and especially within the virial radii) a population
with reduced SFR with respect to the field is observed. Our results show that the two parametrisations
adopted to describe the environment have different physical meanings, i.e.are intrinsically
related to different physical processes acting on galaxy populations and are able to probe different
physical scales.
