Coalescing black hole (BH) binaries forming in the dense core of globular clusters (GCs) are expected
to be one the brightest sources of gravitational wave (GW) radiation for the next generation of ground-based
laser interferometers. Favorable conditions for merger are initiated by the Kozai resonance in
which the gravitational interaction with a third distant object, typically another BH, induces
quasi-periodic variations of the inner BH binary eccentricity. In this paper we perform high precision
N-body simulations of the long term evolution of hierarchical BH triples and investigate the conditions
that lead to the merging of the BH binary and the way it might become an observable source of GW radiation.
We find that the secular orbit average treatment, adopted in previous works, does not reliably describe
the dynamics of these systems if the binary is orbited by the outer BH on a highly inclined orbit at
a moderate distance. During the high eccentricity phase of a Kozai cycle the torque due to the outer
BH can drive the binary to extremely large eccentricities in a fraction of the binary's orbital period.
This occurs before relativistic terms become important to the evolution and allows the binary GW
signal to reach large GW frequencies (>~10 Hz) at high eccentricities. We show that ~50 % of coalescing
BH binaries driven by the Kozai mechanism in GCs will have eccentricities larger than 0.1, with 10
% of them being extremely eccentric, (1-e)<~10^-5, when they first chirp in the frequency band
of ground based laser interferometers. This implies that a large fraction of such GW sources could
be missed if conventional quasi-circular templates are used for analysis of GW detectors data.
The efficient detection of all coalescing BH binaries in GCs will therefore require template banks
of eccentric inspiral waveforms for matched-filtering and dedicated search strategies.
