We present the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observation of the Sub-millimeter
galaxy (SMG) ID 141 at z=4.24 in the [N II] 205 $\mu$m line (hereafter [N II]) and the underlying continuum
at (rest-frame) 197.6 $\mu$m. Benefiting from lensing magnification by a galaxy pair at z=0.595,
ID 141 is one of the brightest z$>4$ SMGs. At the angular resolutions of $\sim1.2''$ to $1.5''$ ($1''
\sim6.9$ kpc), our observation clearly separates, and moderately resolves the two lensed images
in both continuum and line emission at $\rm S/N>5$ . Our continuum-based lensing model implies an
averaged amplification factor of $\sim5.8$ and reveals that the de-lensed continuum image has
the S\'ersic index $\simeq 0.95$ and the S\'ersic radius of $\sim0.18'' (\sim 1.24$ kpc). Furthermore,
the reconstructed [N II] velocity field in the source plane is dominated by a rotation component
with a maximum velocity of $\sim 300$ km/s at large radii, indicating a dark matter halo mass of $\sim
10^{12}M_{\odot}$. This, together with the reconstructed velocity dispersion field being smooth
and modest in value ($<100$ km/s) over much of the outer parts of the galaxy, favours the interpretation
of ID 141 being a disk galaxy dynamically supported by rotation. The observed [N II]/CO (7-6) and
[N II]/[C II] 158 $\mu$m line luminosity ratios, which are consistent with the corresponding line
ratio vs. far-infrared color correlation from local luminous infrared galaxies, imply a de-lensed
star formation rate of ($1.8\pm 0.6)\times10^3M_\odot$/yr and provide an independent estimate
on the size of the star-forming region $0.7^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$ kpc in radius.
