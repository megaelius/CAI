To establish the connection between galaxies and UV-detected absorption systems in the local universe,
a deep ($g\leq20$) and wide ($\sim20^{\prime}$ radius) galaxy redshift survey is presented around
47 sight lines to UV-bright AGN observed by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS). Specific COS
science team papers have used this survey to connect absorbers to galaxies, groups of galaxies,
and large-scale structures, including voids. Here we present the technical details of the survey
and the basic measurements required for its use, including redshifts for individual galaxies and
uncertainties determined collectively by spectral class (emission-line, absorption-line,
and composite spectra) and completeness for each sight line as a function of impact parameter and
magnitude. For most of these sight lines the design criteria of $>90$% completeness over a $>1$ Mpc
region down to $\lesssim0.1\,L^*$ luminosities at $z\leq0.1$ allows a plausible association
between low-$z$ absorbers and individual galaxies. Ly$\alpha$ covering fractions are computed
to approximate the star-forming and passive galaxy populations using the spectral classes above.
In agreement with previous results, the covering fraction of star-forming galaxies with $L\geq0.3\,L^*$
is consistent with unity inside one virial radius and declines slowly to $>50$% at 4 virial radii.
On the other hand, passive galaxies have lower covering fractions ($\sim60$%) and a shallower decline
with impact parameter, suggesting that their gaseous halos are patchy but have a larger scale-length
than star-forming galaxies. All spectra obtained by this project are made available electronically
for individual measurement and use.
