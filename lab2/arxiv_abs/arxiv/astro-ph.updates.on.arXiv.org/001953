The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of planet candidates. Currently, some of them have
already been discarded; more than 200 have been confirmed by follow-up observations, and several
hundreds have been validated. However, most of them are still awaiting for confirmation. Thus,
priorities (in terms of the probability of the candidate being a real planet) must be established
for subsequent observations. The motivation of this work is to provide a set of isolated (good) host
candidates to be further tested by other techniques. We identify close companions of the candidates
that could have contaminated the light curve of the planet host. We used the AstraLux North instrument
located at the 2.2 m telescope in the Calar Alto Observatory to obtain diffraction-limited images
of 174 Kepler objects of interest. The lucky-imaging technique used in this work is compared to other
AO and speckle imaging observations of Kepler planet host candidates. We define a new parameter,
the blended source confidence level (BSC), to assess the probability of an object to have blended
non-detected eclipsing binaries capable of producing the detected transit. We find that 67.2%
of the observed Kepler hosts are isolated within our detectability limits, and 32.8% have at least
one visual companion at angular separations below 6 arcsec. We find close companions (below 3 arcsec)
for the 17.2% of the sample. The planet properties of this sample of non-isolated hosts are revised.
We report one possible S-type binary (KOI-3158). We also report three possible false positives
(KOIs 1230.01, 3649.01, and 3886.01) due to the presence of close companions. The BSC parameter
is calculated for all the isolated targets and compared to both the value prior to any high-resolution
image and, when possible, to observations from previous high-spatial resolution surveys in the
Kepler sample.
