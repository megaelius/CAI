We measured gas-phase metallicity, ionisation parameter and dust extinction for 1795 representative
local star-forming galaxies using integral field spectroscopy from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey.
We self-consistently derive these quantities by comparing observed line fluxes with photoionisation
models using a Bayesian framework. We also present the first comprehensive study of the [SIII]$\lambda\lambda$9069,9532
nebular lines, which have long been predicted to be ideal tracers of the ionisation parameter. Unfortunately,
we find that current photoionisation models substantially over-predict [SIII] lines intensity,
while broadly reproducing other observed optical line ratios. We discuss how to nonetheless make
use of the information provided by [SIII] lines by setting a prior on the ionisation parameter. Following
this approach, we derive spatially-resolved maps and radial profiles of metallicity and ionisation
parameter. The metallicity radial profiles are comparable with previous works, with metallicity
declining toward the outer parts and a flattening in the central regions, in agreement with infall
models of galaxy formation, that predict that spiral discs build up through accretion of material,
which leads to an inside-out growth. On the other hand, ionisation parameter radial profiles are
flat for low-mass galaxies, while their slope becomes positive as galaxy mass increases. However,
the ionisation parameter maps we obtain are clumpy, especially for low-mass galaxies. Ionisation
parameter is tightly correlated with the H$\alpha$ equivalent width [EW(H$\alpha$)], following
a nearly universal relation, which we attribute to the change of the spectral shape of ionising sources
due to ageing of HII regions. We derive a positive correlation between ionisation parameter and
metallicity at fixed EW(H$\alpha$), in disagreement with previous theoretical works expecting
an anti-correlation.
