Recent studies have found a significant evolution and scatter in the IRX-$\beta$ relation at z >
4, suggesting different dust properties of these galaxies. The total far-infrared (FIR) luminosity
is key for this analysis but poorly constrained in normal (main-sequence) star-forming z > 5 galaxies
where often only one single FIR point is available. To better inform estimates of the FIR luminosity,
we construct a sample of local galaxies and three low-redshift analogs of z > 5 systems. The trends
in this sample suggest that normal high-redshift galaxies have a warmer infrared (IR) SED compared
to average z < 4 galaxies that are used as prior in these studies. The blue-shifted peak and mid-IR
excess emission could be explained by a combination of a larger fraction of the metal-poor inter-stellar
medium (ISM) being optically thin to ultra-violet (UV) light and a stronger UV radiation field due
to high star formation densities. Assuming a maximally warm IR SED suggests 0.6 dex increased total
FIR luminosities, which removes some tension between dust attenuation models and observations
of the IRX-$\beta$ relation at z > 5. Despite this, some galaxies still fall below the minimum IRX-$\beta$
relation derived with standard dust cloud models. We propose that radiation pressure in these highly
star-forming galaxies causes a spatial offset between dust clouds and young star-forming regions
within the lifetime of O/B stars. These offsets change the radiation balance and create viewing-angle
effects that can change UV colors at fixed IRX. We provide a modified model that can explain the location
of these galaxies on the IRX-$\beta$ diagram.
