We provide a valid magnetohydrostatic equilibrium from the collapse of a 2D X-point in the presence
of a finite plasma pressure, in which the current density is not simply concentrated in an infinitesimally
thin, one-dimensional current sheet, as found in force-free solutions. In particular, we wish
to determine if a finite pressure current sheet will still involve a singular current, and if so,
what is the nature of the singularity. We use a full MHD code, with the resistivity set to zero, so that
reconnection is not allowed, to run a series of experiments in which an X-point is perturbed and then
is allowed to relax towards an equilibrium, via real, viscous damping forces. Changes to the magnitude
of the perturbation and the initial plasma pressure are investigated systematically. The final
state found in our experiments is a "quasi-static" equilibrium where the viscous relaxation has
completely ended, but the peak current density at the null increases very slowly following an asymptotic
regime towards an infinite time singularity. Using a high grid resolution allows us to resolve the
current structures in this state both in width and length. In comparison with the well known pressureless
studies, the system does not evolve towards a thin current sheet, but concentrates the current at
the null and the separatrices. The growth rate of the singularity is found to be tD, with 0 < D <
1. This rate depends directly on the initial plasma pressure, and decreases as the pressure is increased.
At the end of our study, we present an analytical description of the system in a quasi-static non-singular
equilibrium at a given time, in which a finite thick current layer has formed at the null.
