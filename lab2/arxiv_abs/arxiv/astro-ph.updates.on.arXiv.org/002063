The direct detection of gravitational waves with upcoming second-generation gravitational wave
detectors such as Advanced LIGO and Virgo will allow us to probe the genuinely strong-field dynamics
of general relativity (GR) for the first time. We present a data analysis pipeline called TIGER (Test
Infrastructure for GEneral Relativity), which is designed to utilize detections of compact binary
coalescences to test GR in this regime. TIGER is a model-independent test of GR itself, in that it
is not necessary to compare with any specific alternative theory. It performs Bayesian inference
on two hypotheses: the GR hypothesis $\mathcal{H}_{\rm GR}$, and $\mathcal{H}_{\rm modGR}$,
which states that one or more of the post-Newtonian coefficients in the waveform are not as predicted
by GR. By the use of multiple sub-hypotheses of $\mathcal{H}_{\rm modGR}$, in each of which a different
number of parameterized deformations of the GR phase are allowed, an arbitrarily large number of
'testing parameters' can be used without having to worry about a model being insufficiently parsimonious
if the true number of extra parameters is in fact small. TIGER is well-suited to the regime where most
sources have low signal-to-noise ratios, again through the use of these sub-hypotheses. Information
from multiple sources can trivially be combined, leading to a stronger test. We focus on binary neutron
star coalescences, for which sufficiently accurate waveform models are available that can be generated
fast enough on a computer to be fit for use in Bayesian inference. We show that the pipeline is robust
against a number of fundamental, astrophysical, and instrumental effects, such as differences
between waveform approximants, a limited number of post-Newtonian phase contributions being
known, the effects of neutron star spins and tidal deformability on the orbital motion, and instrumental
calibration errors.
