The Rezzolla-Zhidenko (RZ) framework provides an efficient approach to characterize spherically
symmetric black-hole spacetimes in arbitrary metric theories of gravity using a small number of
variables [L. Rezzolla and A. Zhidenko, Phys. Rev. D. 90, 084009 (2014)]. These variables can be
obtained in principle from near-horizon measurements of various astrophysical processes, thus
potentially enabling efficient tests of both black-hole properties and the theory of general relativity
in the strong-field regime. Here, we extend this framework to allow for the parametrization of arbitrary
asymptotically-flat, spherically symmetric metrics and introduce the notion of a 11-dimensional
(11D) parametrization space $\Pi$, on which each solution can be visualised as a curve or surface.
An $\mathscr{L}^2$ norm on this space is used to measure the deviation of a particular compact object
solution from the Schwarzschild black-hole solution. We calculate various observables, related
to particle and photon orbits, within this framework and demonstrate that the relative errors we
obtain are low (about $10^{-6}$). In particular, we obtain the innermost stable circular orbit
(ISCO) frequency, the unstable photon-orbit impact parameter (shadow radius), the entire orbital
angular speed profile for circular Kepler observers and the entire lensing deflection angle curve
for various types of compact objects, including non-singular and singular black holes, boson stars
and naked singularities, from various theories of gravity. Finally, we provide in a tabular form
the first 11 coefficients of the fourth-order RZ parameterization needed to describe a variety
of commonly used black-hole spacetimes. When comparing with the first-order RZ parameterization
of astrophysical observables such as the ISCO frequency, the coefficients provided here increase
the accuracy of two orders of magnitude or more.
