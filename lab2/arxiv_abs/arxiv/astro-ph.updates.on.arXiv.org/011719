Identifying the structure of our Galaxy has always been fraught with difficulties, and while modern
surveys continue to make progress building a map of the Milky Way, there is still much to understand.
The arm and bar features are important drivers in shaping the interstellar medium, but their exact
nature and influence still require attention. We present results of smoothed particle hydrodynamic
simulations of gas in the Milky Way including star formation, stellar feedback, and ISM cooling,
when exposed to different arm and bar features, with the aim of better understanding how well newly
formed stars trace out the underlying structure of the Galaxy. The bar is given a faster pattern speed
than the arms, resulting in a complex, time-dependent morphology and star formation. Inter-arm
branches and spurs are easily influenced by the bar, especially in the two-armed spiral models where
there is a wide region of resonance overlap in the disc. As the bar over-takes the spiral arms it induces
small boosts in star formation and enhances spiral features, which occur at regularly spaced beat-like
intervals. The locations of star formation events are similar to those seen in observational data,
and do not show a perfect 1:1 correspondence with the underlying spiral potential, though arm tangencies
are generally well traced by young stars. Stellar velocity fields from the newly formed stars are
compared to data from Gaia DR2, showing that the spiral and bar features can reproduce many of the
non-axisymmetric features seen in the data. A simple analytical model is used to show many of these
feature are a natural response of gas to rigidly rotating spiral and bar potentials.
