Inversion of interstellar gas or dust columns measured along the path to stars distributed in distance
and direction allows reconstructing the distribution of interstellar matter (ISM) in 3D. A low
resolution IS dust map based on the reddening of 23,000 stars illustrates the potential of future
maps. It reveals the location of the main IS clouds within $\sim$1kpc and, owing to biases towards
weakly reddened targets, regions devoid of IS matter. It traces the Local Bubble and neighboring
cavities, including a giant, $\geq$1000 pc long cavity located beyond the so-called $\beta$CMa
tunnel, bordered by the main constituents of the Gould belt (GB), the rotating and expanding ring
of clouds and young stars, inclined by $\sim$ 20$^{\circ}$ to the galactic plane. From comparison
with diffuse X-ray background and absorption data it appears that the giant cavity is filled with
warm, ionized and dust-poor gas in addition to million K gas. This set of structures must reflect
the main events that occurred in the past. It has been suggested that the Cretaceus-Tertiary mass
extinction may be due to a gamma-ray burst (GRB) in the massive globular cluster (GC) 47 Tuc during
its close encounter with the Sun $\sim$70 Myrs ago. Given the mass, speed and size of 47 Tuc, wherever
it crossed the Galactic plane it must have produced at the crossing site significant dynamical effects
on the disk stars and IS clouds, and triggered star formation. Interestingly, first-order estimates
suggest that the GB dynamics and age could match the consequences of the cluster crossing. Additionally,
the giant ionized, dust-free cavity could be related to an intense flux of hard radiation, and dust-gas
decoupling after the burst could explain the high variability and pattern of the D/H ratio in the
nearby gaseous ISM. Future Gaia data should confirm or dismiss this hypothesis.
