We present a study of simultaneous determination of mean distance and reddening to the Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC) using the two photometric band RR Lyrae data. Currently vailable largest number of highly
accurate and precise light curve data of the fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars (RRab) with better areal
coverage released by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE)-IV project observed
in the two photometric bands $(V,I)$ were utilized simultaneously in order to determine true distance
and reddening independently for each of the individual RRab stars. Different emipirical and theoretical
calibrations leading to the determination of absolute magnitude of RRab stars in the two bands,
$V$ and $I$ along with their mean magnitudes were utilized to calculate the apparent distance moduli
of each of these RRab stars in these two bands. Decomposing the apparent distance moduli into true
distance modulus and reddening in each of these two bands, individual RRab distance and reddening
were estimated solving the two apparent distance moduli equations. Modeling the observed distributions
of the true distance moduli and reddenings of the SMC RRab stars as Gaussian, the true mean distance
modulus and mean reddening value to the SMC were found to be $\mu_{0}=18.930\pm0.165$ mag and $E(B-V)=0.056\pm0.019$
mag, respectively. This corresponds to a distance of $D = 61.237\pm4.544$~kpc to the SMC. The three
dimensional distribution of the SMC RRab stars was approximated as ellipsoid. Then using the principal
axes transformation method \citep{deb14} we find the axes ratios of the SMC: $1.000\pm0.001$,$1.100\pm
0.001$, $2.600\pm0.015$ with $i=2^{\circ}.300\pm0^{\circ}.140$ and $\theta_{\text{lon}}=38^{\circ}.500\pm0.300$.
These results are in agreement with other recent independent previous studies using different
tracers and methodologies.
