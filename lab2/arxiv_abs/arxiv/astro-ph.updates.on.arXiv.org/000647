We present the first absolute proper motion measurement of Leo I, based on two epochs of HST ACS/WFC
images separated by ~5 years. The average shift of Leo I stars with respect to ~100 background galaxies
implies a proper motion of (mu_W, mu_N) = (0.1140 +/- 0.0295, -0.1256 +/- 0.0293) mas/yr. The implied
Galactocentric velocity vector, corrected for the reflex motion of the Sun, has radial and tangential
components V_rad = 167.9 +/- 2.8 km/s and V_tan = 101.0 +/- 34.4 km/s, respectively. We study the detailed
orbital history of Leo I by solving its equations of motion backward in time for a range of plausible
mass models for the Milky Way and its surrounding galaxies. Leo I entered the Milky Way virial radius
2.33 +/- 0.21 Gyr ago, most likely on its first infall. It had a pericentric approach 1.05 +/- 0.09
Gyr ago at a Galactocentric distance of 91 +/- 36 kpc. We associate these time scales with characteristic
time scales in Leo I's star formation history, which shows an enhanced star formation activity ~2
Gyr ago and quenching ~1 Gyr ago. There is no indication from our calculations that other galaxies
have significantly influenced Leo I's orbit, although there is a small probability that it may have
interacted with either Ursa Minor or Leo II within the last ~1 Gyr. For most plausible Milky Way masses,
the observed velocity implies that Leo I is bound to the Milky Way. However, it may not be appropriate
to include it in models of the Milky Way satellite population that assume dynamical equilibrium,
given its recent infall. Solution of the complete (non-radial) timing equations for the Leo I orbit
implies a Milky Way mass M_MW,vir = 3.15 (-1.36, +1.58) x 10^12 Msun, with the large uncertainty dominated
by cosmic scatter. In a companion paper, we compare the new observations to the properties of Leo
I subhalo analogs extracted from cosmological simulations.
