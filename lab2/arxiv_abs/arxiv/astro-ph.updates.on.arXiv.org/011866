Near-term studies of Venus-like atmospheres with JWST promise to advance our knowledge of terrestrial
planet evolution. However, the remote study of Venus in the Solar System and the ongoing efforts
to characterize gaseous exoplanets both suggest that high altitude aerosols could limit observational
studies of lower atmospheres, and potentially make it challenging to recognize exoplanets as "Venus-like".
To support practical approaches for exo-Venus characterization with JWST, we use Venus-like atmospheric
models with self-consistent cloud formation of the seven TRAPPIST-1 exoplanets to investigate
the atmospheric depth that can be probed using both transmission and emission spectroscopy. We
find that JWST/MIRI LRS secondary eclipse emission spectroscopy in the 6 $\mu$m opacity window
could probe at least an order of magnitude deeper pressures than transmission spectroscopy, potentially
allowing access to the sub-cloud atmosphere for the two hot innermost TRAPPIST-1 planets. In addition,
we identify two confounding effects of sulfuric acid aerosols that may carry strong implications
for the characterization of terrestrial exoplanets with transmission spectroscopy: (1) there
exists an ambiguity between cloud-top and solid surface in producing the observed spectral continuum;
and (2) the cloud-forming region drops in altitude with semi-major axis, causing an increase in
the observable cloud-top pressure with decreasing stellar insolation. Taken together, these
effects could produce a trend of thicker atmospheres observed at lower stellar insolation---a
convincing false positive for atmospheric escape and an empirical "cosmic shoreline". However,
developing observational and theoretical techniques to identify Venus-like exoplanets and discriminate
them from stellar windswept worlds will enable advances in the emerging field of terrestrial comparative
planetology.
