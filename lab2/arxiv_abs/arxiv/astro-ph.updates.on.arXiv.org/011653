We present a catalog of 5437 morphologically classified sources in the direction of the Perseus
galaxy cluster core, among them 496 early-type low-mass galaxy candidates. The catalog is primarily
based on V-band imaging data acquired with the William Herschel Telescope, which we used to conduct
automated source detection and to derive photometry. We additionally reduced archival Subaru
multiband imaging data in order to measure aperture colors and to perform a morphological classification,
benefiting from 0.5 arcsec seeing conditions in the r-band data. Based on morphological and color
properties, we extracted a sample of early-type low-mass galaxy candidates with absolute V-band
magnitudes in the range of -10 to -20 mag. In the color-magnitude diagram the galaxies are located
where the red sequence for early-type cluster galaxies is expected, and they lie on the literature
relation between absolute magnitude and S\'{e}rsic index. We classified the early-type dwarf
candidates into nucleated and nonnucleated galaxies. For the faint candidates, we found a trend
of increasing nucleation fraction toward brighter luminosity or higher surface brightness, similar
to what is observed in other nearby galaxy clusters. We morphologically classified the remaining
sources as likely background elliptical galaxies, late-type galaxies, edge-on disk galaxies,
and likely merging systems and discussed the expected contamination fraction through non-early-type
cluster galaxies in the magnitude-size surface brightness parameter space. Our catalog reaches
its 50 per cent completeness limit at an absolute V-band luminosity of -12 mag and a V-band surface
brightness of 26 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. This makes it to the largest and deepest catalog with coherent
coverage compared to previous imaging studies of the Perseus cluster.
