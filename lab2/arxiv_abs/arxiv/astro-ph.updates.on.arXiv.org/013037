The size and structure of the dusty circumnuclear torus in active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be investigated
by analyzing the temporal response of the torus's infrared (IR) dust emission to variations in the
AGN ultraviolet/optical luminosity. This method, reverberation mapping, is applicable over
a wide redshift range, but the IR response is sensitive to several poorly constrained variables
relating to the dust distribution and its illumination, complicating the interpretation of measured
reverberation lags. We have used an enhanced version of our torus reverberation mapping code (TORMAC)
to conduct a comprehensive exploration of the torus response functions at selected wavelengths,
for the standard interstellar medium grain composition. The shapes of the response functions vary
widely over the parameter range covered by our models, with the largest variations occurring at
shorter wavelengths ($\leq 4.5\,\mu$m). The reverberation lag, quantified as the response-weighted
delay (RWD), is most affected by the radial depth of the torus, the steepness of the radial cloud distribution,
the degree of anisotropy of the AGN radiation field, and the volume filling factor. Nevertheless,
we find that the RWD provides a reasonably robust estimate, to within a factor of $\sim 3$, of the luminosity-weighted
torus radius, confirming the basic assumption underlying reverberation mapping. However, overall,
the models predict radii at $2.2\,\mu$m that are a typically factor of $\sim 2$ larger than those
derived from K-band reverberation mapping. This is likely an indication that the innermost region
of the torus is populated by clouds dominated by large graphite grains.
