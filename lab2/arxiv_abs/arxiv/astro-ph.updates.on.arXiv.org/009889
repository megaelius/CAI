We present an IRAM 30m line survey of the dense core L483 in the 3 mm band. We detected 71 molecules (140
including different isotopologs), most of which are present in the cold and quiescent ambient cloud.
Of particular interest among the detected molecules are the cis isomer of HCOOH, the complex organic
molecules HCOOCH3, CH3OCH3, and C2H5OH, a wide variety of carbon chains, nitrogen oxides like N2O,
and saturated molecules like CH3SH. In general, fractional molecular abundances in L483 are systematically
lower than in TMC-1 (especially for carbon chains), tend to be higher than in L1544 and B1-b, and are
similar to those in L1527. Apart from the overabundance of carbon chains in TMC-1, we find that L483
does not have a marked chemical differentiation with respect to starless/prestellar cores like
TMC-1 and L1544, although it does chemically differentiate from Class 0 hot corino sources like
IRAS 16293-2422. This fact suggests that the chemical composition of the ambient cloud of some Class
0 sources could be largely inherited from the dark cloud starless/prestellar phase. We also derived
isotopic ratios for a variety of molecules, some of which show isotopic anomalies like an extreme
depletion in 13C for one of the two isotopologs of c-C3H2, a drastic enrichment in 18O for SO and HNCO
(SO being also largely enriched in 17O), and different abundances for the two 13C substituted species
of C2H and the two 15N substituted species of N2H+. We report the first detection in space of some minor
isotopologs like c-C3D. The exhaustive chemical characterization of L483 presented here, together
with similar studies of other prestellar and protostellar sources, should allow us to identify
the main factors that regulate the chemical composition of cores along the process of formation
of low-mass protostars.
