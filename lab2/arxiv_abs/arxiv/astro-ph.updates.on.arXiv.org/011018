In most surface-bound exospheres Na has been observed at altitudes above what is possible by thermal
release. Photon stimulated desorption of adsorbed Na on solid surfaces has been commonly used to
explain observations at high altitudes. We investigate three model velocity distribution functions
(VDF) that have been previously used in several studies to describe the desorption of atoms from
a solid surface either by electron or by photon bombardment, namely: the Maxwell-Boltzmann (M-B)
distribution, the empirical distribution proposed by [Wurz et al., 2010] for PSD, and the Weibull
distribution. We use all available measurements reported by [Yakshinskiy and Madey, 2000, 2004]
to test these distributions and determine which one fits best (statistically) and we discuss their
physical validity. Our results show that the measured VDF of released Na atoms are too narrow compared
to Maxwell-Boltzmann fits with supra-temperatures as suggested by [3]. We found that a good fit
with M-B is only achieved with a speed offset of the whole distribution to higher speeds and a lower
temperature, with the offset and the fit temperature not showing any correlation with the surface
temperature. From the three distributions we studied, we find that the Weibull distribution provides
the best fits using the temperature of the surface, though an offset towards higher speeds is required.
This work confirms that Electron-Stimulated Desorption (ESD) and Photon-Stimulated Desorption
(PSD) should produce non-thermal velocity (or energy) distributions of the atoms released via
these processes, which is expected from surface physics. We recommend to use the Weibull distribution
with the shape parameter kappa=1.7, the speed offset v0=575 m/s, and the surface temperature to
model PSD distributions at planetary bodies.
