We present a community study exploring the low frequency (5 - 800 MHz) options and opportunities
for the ngVLA project and its infrastructure. We describe a Next Generation LOw Band Observatory
(ngLOBO) that will provide access to the low frequency sky in a commensal fashion, operating independently
from the ngVLA, but leveraging common infrastructure. This approach provides continuous coverage
through an aperture array (called ngLOBO-Low) below 150 MHz and by accessing the primary focus of
the ngVLA antennas (called ngLOBO-High) above 150 MHz. ngLOBO preconditions include a) non-interference
and b) low relative cost (<5%) with respect to ngVLA. ngLOBO has three primary scientific missions:
(1) Radio Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (Radio-LSST): one naturally wide beam, commensal with
ngVLA, will conduct a continuous synoptic survey of large swaths of the sky for both slow and fast
transients; (2) This same commensal beam will provide complementary low frequency images of all
ngVLA targets and their environment {\it when such data enhances their value}. (3) Independent
beams from the ngLOBO-Low aperture array will conduct research in astrophysics, Earth science
and space weather applications, engaging new communities and attracting independent resources.
If ngVLA operates down to 2 GHz or lower, ngLOBO data will enhance ngVLA calibration and dynamic scheduling.
Finally, non-variable field sources outside the ngVLA field of view can be harvested for serendipitous
science, e.g. population studies for thermal and non-thermal continuum sources. The ngVLA will
be a superb, high frequency instrument; ngLOBO will allow it to participate in the worldwide renaissance
in low frequency science as well.
