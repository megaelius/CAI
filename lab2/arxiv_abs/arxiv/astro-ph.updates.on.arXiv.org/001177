Feedback heating from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has been commonly invoked to suppress cooling
flows predicted in hot gas in elliptical galaxies, galaxy groups and clusters. Previous studies
have focused on if and how AGN feedback heats the gas, but little paid attention to its triggering
mechanism. Using spherically symmetric simulations, we investigate how large-scale cooling
flows are accreted by central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in eight well-observed systems
and find an interesting dichotomy. In massive clusters, the gas develops a central cooling catastrophe
within about the cooling time (typically ~ 100 - 300 Myr), resulting in a cold-mode accretion onto
SMBHs. However, in our four simulated systems on group and galaxy scales at a low metallicity Z=0.3Z_{sun},
the gas quickly settles into a long-term state which has a cuspy central temperature profile extending
to several tens to about 100 pc. At the more realistic solar metallicity, two groups (with R_{e} ~
4 kpc) still host the long-term hot-mode accretion. Both accretion modes naturally appear in our
idealized calculations where only cooling, gas inflow, and compressional heating are considered.
The long-term hot-mode accretion is maintained by the quickly-established closeness between
the timescales of these processes, preferably in systems with low gas densities, low gas metallicities,
and importantly, compact central galaxies, which result in strong gravitational acceleration
and compressional heating at the intermediate radii. Our calculations predict that central cuspy
temperature profiles appear more often in smaller systems than galaxy clusters, which instead
often host significant cold gas and star formation.
