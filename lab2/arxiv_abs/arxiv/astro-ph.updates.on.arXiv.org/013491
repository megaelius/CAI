Neutrino-driven convection plays a crucial role in the development of core-collapse supernova
(CCSN) explosions. However, the complex mechanism that triggers the shock revival and the subsequent
explosion has remained inscrutable for many decades. Multidimensional simulations suggest that
the growth of fluid instabilities and the development of turbulent convection will determine the
morphology of the explosion. We have performed 3D simulations using spherical-polar coordinates
covering a reduced angular extent (90 degree computational domain), and with angular resolutions
of 2 degrees, 1 degree, 1/2 degree, and 1/4 degree, to study the development of turbulence in core-collapse
supernova explosions on a time scale of order 100 ms. We have employed the multi-physics Chimera
code that includes detailed nuclear physics and spectral neutrino transport. Coarse resolution
models do not develop an inertial range, presumably due to the bottleneck effect, such that the energy
is prevented from cascading down to small scales and tends to accumulate at large scales. High-resolution
models instead, start to recover the k^{-5/3} scaling of Kolmogorov's theory. Stochasticity and
few simulation samples limit our ability to predict the development of explosions. Over the simulated
time period, our models show no clear trend in improving (or diminishing) conditions for explosion
as the angular resolution is increased. However, we find that turbulence provides an effective
pressure behind the shock (approx. 40 - 50 % of the thermal pressure), which can contribute to the
shock revival and be conducive for the development of the explosion. Finally, we show that the turbulent
energy power spectrum of reduced angular extent and full 4 pi models are consistent, thus indicating
that a 90 degree computational domain is an adequate configuration to study the character of turbulence
in CCSNe.
