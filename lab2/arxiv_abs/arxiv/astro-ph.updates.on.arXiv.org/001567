We investigate the connection between dust and gas in the nearby edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 891. High
resolution Herschel PACS and SPIRE 70, 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 $\mu$m images are combined with
JCMT SCUBA 850 $\mu$m observations to trace the far-infrared/submillimetre spectral energy distribution
(SED). Maps of the HI 21 cm line and CO(J=3-2) emission trace the atomic and molecular hydrogen gas,
respectively. We fit one-component modified blackbody models to the integrated SED, finding a
global dust mass of 8.5$\times$10$^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$ and an average temperature of 23$\pm$2 K.
We also fit the pixel-by-pixel SEDs to produce maps of the dust mass and temperature. The dust mass
distribution correlates with the total stellar population as traced by the 3.6 $\mu$m emission.
The derived dust temperature, which ranges from approximately 17 to 24 K, is found to correlate with
the 24 $\mu$m emission. Allowing the dust emissivity index to vary, we find an average value of $\beta$
= 1.9$\pm$0.3. We confirm an inverse relation between the dust emissivity spectral index and dust
temperature, but do not observe any variation of this relationship with vertical height from the
mid-plane of the disk. A comparison of the dust properties with the gaseous components of the ISM
reveals strong spatial correlations between the surface mass densities of dust and the molecular
hydrogen and total gas surface densities. Observed asymmetries in the dust temperature, and the
H$_{2}$-to-dust and total gas-to-dust ratios hint that an enhancement in the star formation rate
may be the result of larger quantities of molecular gas available to fuel star formation in the NE
compared to the SW. Whilst the asymmetry likely arises from dust obscuration due to the geometry
of the line-of-sight projection of the spiral arms, we cannot exclude an enhancement in the star
formation rate in the NE side of the disk.
