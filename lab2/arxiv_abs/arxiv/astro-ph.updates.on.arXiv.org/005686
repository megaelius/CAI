Thanks to the Rosetta mission, our understanding of comets has greatly improved. A very good opportunity
to apply this knowledge appeared in early 2017 with the appearance of the Jupiter family comet 41P/TGK.
We performed an observational campaign with the TRAPPIST telescopes that covered almost the entire
period of time when the comet was active. In this work we present a comprehensive study of the evolution
of the dust environment of 41P based on observational data from January to July, 2017. Also, we performed
numerical simulations to constrain its origin and dynamical nature. To model the observational
data set we used a Monte Carlo dust tail model, which allowed us to derive the dust parameters that
best describe its dust environment as a function of heliocentric distance. In order to study its
dynamical evolution, we completed several experiments to evaluate the degree of stability of its
orbit, its life time in its current region close to Earth, and its future behaviour. From the dust
analysis, we found that comet 41P has a complex emission pattern that shifted from full isotropic
to anisotropic ejection sometime during February 24-March 14 in 2017, and then from anisotropic
to full isotropic again between June 7-28. During the anisotropic period, the emission was controlled
by two strongly active areas, where one was located in the southern and one in the northern hemisphere
of the nucleus. The total dust mass loss is estimated to be $\sim7.5\times10^{8}$ kg. From the dynamical
simulations we estimate that $\sim$3600 yr is the period of time during which 41P will remain in a
similar orbit. Taking into account the estimated mass loss per orbit, after 3600 yr, the nucleus
may lose about 30$\%$ of its mass. However, based on its observed dust-to-water mass ratio and its
propensity to outbursts, the lifetime of this comet could be much shorter.
