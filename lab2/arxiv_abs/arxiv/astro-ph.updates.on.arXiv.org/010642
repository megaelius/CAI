Ly$\alpha$ emission is widely used to detect and confirm high-redshift galaxies and characterize
the evolution of the intergalactic medium. However, many galaxies do not display Ly$\alpha$ emission
in typical spectroscopic observations, and intrinsic Ly$\alpha$-emitters represent a potentially
biased set of high-redshift galaxies. In this work, we analyze a set of 703 galaxies at $2\lesssim
z\lesssim3$ with both Ly$\alpha$ spectroscopy and measurements of other rest-frame ultraviolet
and optical properties in order to develop an empirical model for Ly$\alpha$ emission from galaxies
and understand how the probability of Ly$\alpha$ emission depends on other observables. We consider
several empirical proxies for the efficiency of Ly$\alpha$ photon production as well as the subsequent
escape of these photons through their local interstellar medium. We find that the equivalent width
of metal-line absorption and the O3 ratio of rest-frame optical nebular lines are advantageous
empirical proxies for Ly$\alpha$ escape and production, respectively. We develop a new quantity,
$X_\mathrm{LIS}^\mathrm{O3}$, that combines these two properties into a single predictor of
net Ly$\alpha$ emission, which we find describes $\sim$90% of the observed variance in Ly$\alpha$
equivalent width when accounting for our observational uncertainties. We also construct conditional
probability distributions demonstrating that galaxy selection based on measurements of galaxy
properties yield samples of galaxies with widely varying probabilities of net Ly$\alpha$ emission.
The application of the empirical models and probability distributions described here may be used
to infer the selection biases of current galaxy surveys and evaluate the significance of high-redshift
Ly$\alpha$ (non-)detections in studies of reionization and the intergalactic medium.
