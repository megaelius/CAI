A growing subset of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) show evidence for unexpected interaction with a dense
circumstellar medium (SNe Ia-CSM). The precise nature of the progenitor, however, remains debated
owing to spectral ambiguities arising from a strong contribution from the CSM interaction. Late-time
spectra offer potential insight if the post-shock cold, dense shell becomes sufficiently thin
and/or the ejecta begin to cross the reverse shock. To date, few high-quality spectra of this kind
exist. Here we report on the late-time optical and infrared spectra of the SNe~Ia-CSM 2012ca and
2013dn. These SNe Ia-CSM spectra exhibit low [Fe III]/[Fe II] ratios and strong [Ca II] at late epochs.
Such characteristics are reminiscent of the super-Chandrasekhar-mass (SC) candidate SN 2009dc,
for which these features suggested a low-ionisation state due to high densities, although the broad
Fe features admittedly show similarities to the blue "quasi-continuum" observed in some core-collapse
SNe Ibn and IIn. Neither SN 2012ca nor any of the other SNe Ia-CSM show evidence for broad oxygen, carbon,
or magnesium in their spectra. Similar to the interacting Type IIn SN 2005ip, a number of high-ionisation
lines are identified in SN 2012ca, including [S III], [Ar III], [Ar X], [Fe VIII], [Fe X], and possibly
[Fe XI]. The total bolometric energy output does not exceed 10^51 erg, but does require a large kinetic-to-radiative
conversion efficiency. All of these observations taken together suggest that SNe Ia-CSM are more
consistent with a thermonuclear explosion than a core-collapse event, although detailed radiative
transfer models are certainly necessary to confirm these results.
