Theoretical calculations and some indirect observations show that massive exoplanets on tight
orbits must decay due to tidal dissipation within their host stars. This orbital evolution could
be observationally accessible through precise transit timing over a course of decades. The rate
of planetary in-spiralling may not only help us to understand some aspects of evolution of planetary
systems, but also can be used as a probe of the stellar internal structure. In this paper we present
results of transit timing campaigns organised for a carefully selected sample of hot Jupiter-like
planets which were found to be the best candidates for detecting planet-star tidal interactions
on the Northern hemisphere. Among them, there is the WASP-12 system which is the best candidate for
possessing an in-falling giant exoplanet. Our new observations support the scenario of orbital
decay of WASP-12 b and allow us to refine its rate. The derived tidal quality parameter of the host
star Q'_{*} = (1.82 +/- 0.32) x 10^5 is in agreement with theoretical predictions for subgiant stars.
For the remaining systems - HAT-P-23, KELT-1, KELT-16, WASP-33, and WASP-103 - our transit timing
data reveal no deviations from the constant-period models, hence constraints on the individual
rates of orbital decay were placed. The tidal quality parameters of host stars in at least 4 systems
- HAT-P-23, KELT-1, WASP-33, and WASP-103 - were found to be greater than the value reported for WASP-12.
This is in line with the finding that those hosts are main sequence stars, for which efficiency of
tidal dissipation is predicted to be relatively weak.
