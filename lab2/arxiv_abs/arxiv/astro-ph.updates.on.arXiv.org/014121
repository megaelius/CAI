We study specific star formation rate (sSFR) and gas profiles of star forming and green valley galaxies
in the Simba cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. Star-forming galaxy half-light radii ($R_{\rm
half}$) at $z=0$ and their evolution ($\propto(1+z)^{-0.78}$) agree with observations. Passive
galaxy $R_{\rm half}$ agree with observations at high redshift, but by $z=0$ are too large, owing
to numerical heating. We compare Simba $z=0$ sSFR radial profiles for star forming and green valley
galaxies to observations. Simba shows strong central depressions in star formation rate (SFR),
sSFR, and gas fraction in green valley galaxies and massive star-forming systems, qualitatively
as observed, owing to black hole X-ray feedback, which pushes central gas outwards. Turning off
X-ray feedback leads to centrally peaked sSFR profiles as in other simulations. In conflict with
observations, Simba yields green valley galaxies with strongly dropping sSFR profiles beyond
$\gtrsim R_{\rm half}$, regardless of AGN feedback. The central depression owes to lowering molecular
gas content; the drop in the outskirts owes to reduced star formation efficiency. Simba's satellites
have higher central sSFR and lower outskirts sSFR than centrals, in qualitative agreement with
observations. At $z=2$ Simba does not show central depressions in massive star-forming galaxies,
suggesting Simba's X-ray feedback should be more active at high-$z$. High resolution tests indicate
central sSFR suppression is not sensitive to numerical resolution. Reproducing the central sSFR
depression in $z=0$ green valley galaxies represents a unique success of Simba. The remaining discrepancies
highlight the importance of SFR and gas profiles in constraining quenching mechanisms.
