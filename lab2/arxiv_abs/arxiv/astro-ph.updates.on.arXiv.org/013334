Outside the Milky Way, the most luminous H2O masers at 22 GHz, called 'megamasers' because of their
extreme luminosity with respect to the Galactic and extragalactic H2O masers associated with star
formation, are mainly detected in active galactic nuclei. In the case of the H2O maser detected in
the nuclear region of the galaxy TXS2226-184 for the first time the term 'gigamaser' was used. However,
the origin of this very luminous H2O maser emission has never been investigated into details. We
study the nature of the H2O gigamaser in TXS2226-184 by measuring for the first time its absolute
position at mas resolution, by comparing the morphology and characteristics of the maser emission
at the VLBI scales after about 20 years, and by trying to detect its polarized emission. We observed
the maser emission towards TXS2226-184 three times: the very first one with the VLBA (epoch 2017.45)
and the next two times with the EVN (epochs 2017.83 and 2018.44). The first two epochs were observed
in phase-reference mode, while the last epoch was observed in full-polarization mode but not in
phase-reference mode to increase the on-source integration time. We also retrieved and analyzed
the VLBA archival data at 22 GHz of TXS2226-184 observed in 1998.40. We detected 6 H2O maser features
in epoch 2017.45 (VLBA), one in epoch 2017.83 (EVN), and two in epoch 2018.44 (EVN). All of them but
one are red-shifted with respect to the systemic velocity of TXS2226-184, we detected only one blue-shifted
maser feature and it is the weakest one. For the first time, we were able to measure the absolute position
of the H2O maser features with errors below 1 mas. No linear and circular polarization was detected.
We were able to associate the H2O maser features in TXS2226-184 with the most luminous radio continuum
clump reported in the literature.
