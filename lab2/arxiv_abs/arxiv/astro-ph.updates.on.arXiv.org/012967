Sub-stellar objects exhibit photometric variability which is believed to be caused by a number
of processes such as magnetically-driven spots or inhomogeneous cloud coverage. Recent sub-stellar
models have shown that turbulent flows and waves, including internal gravity waves, may play an
important role in cloud evolution. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of internal
gravity waves on dust cloud nucleation and dust growth, and whether observations of the resulting
cloud structures could be used to recover atmospheric density information. For a simplified atmosphere
in two dimensions, we numerically solve the governing fluid equations to simulate the effect on
dust nucleation and mantle growth as a result of the passage of an internal gravity wave. Furthermore,
we derive an expression that relates the properties of the wave-induced cloud structures to observable
parameters in order to deduce the atmospheric density. Numerical simulations show that the density,
pressure and temperature variations caused by gravity waves lead to an increase of dust nucleation
by up to a factor 20, and dust mantle growth rate by up to a factor 1.6, compared to their equilibrium
values. Through an exploration of the wider sub-stellar parameter space, we show that in absolute
terms, the increase in dust nucleation due to internal gravity waves is stronger in cooler (T dwarfs)
and $\text{TiO}_2$-rich sub-stellar atmospheres. The relative increase however is greater in
warm (L dwarf) and $\text{TiO}_2$-poor atmospheres due to conditions less suited for efficient
nucleation at equilibrium. These variations lead to banded areas in which dust formation is much
more pronounced, and lead to banded cloud structures similar to those observed on Earth. Using the
proposed method, potential observations of banded clouds could be used to estimate the atmospheric
density of sub-stellar objects.
