The Dark Energy Survey is a stage III dark energy experiment, performing an optical imaging survey
to measure cosmological equation of state parameters using four independent methods. The scope
and complexity of the survey introduced complex strategic and tactical scheduling problems that
needed to be addressed. We begin with an overview of the process used to develop DES strategy and tactics,
from the inception of the project, to task forces that studied and developed strategy changes over
the course of the survey, to the nightly pre-observing meeting in which immediate tactical issues
were addressed. We then summarize the strategic choices made for each sub-survey, including metrics,
scheduling considerations, choice of time domain fields and their sequences of exposures, and
wide survey footprint and pointing layout choices. We go on to describe the detailed process that
determined which specific exposures were taken at which specific times. We give a chronology of
the strategic and tactical peculiarities of each year of observing, including the proposal and
execution of a sixth year. We give an overview of obstac, the implementation of the DES scheduler
used to simulate and evaluate strategic and tactical options, and automate exposure scheduling;
and describe developments in obstac for use after DES. Appendices describe further details of data
quality evaluation, tau, and t_eff; airmass calculation; and modeling of the seeing and sky brightness.
The significant corpus of DES data indicates that the simple scaling relations for seeing as a function
of wavelength and airmass derived from the Kolmogorov turbulence model work adequately for exposure
planning purposes: deviations from these relations are modest in comparison with short time-scale
seeing variations.
