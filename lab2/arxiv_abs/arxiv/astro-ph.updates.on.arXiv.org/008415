We use Gaia DR2 magnitudes, colours and parallaxes for stars with G<12 to explore a 15-dimensional
space that includes simultaneously the initial mass function (IMF) and a non-parametric star formation
history (SFH) for the Galactic disc. This inference is performed by combining the Besancon Galaxy
Model fast approximate simulations (BGM FASt) and an approximate Bayesian computation algorithm.
We find in Gaia DR2 data an imprint of a star formation burst 2-3 Gyr ago, in the Galactic thin disc domain,
and a present star formation rate (SFR) of about 1 Msun. Our results show a decreasing trend of the
SFR from 9-10 Gyr to 6-7 Gyr ago. This is consistent with the cosmological star formation quenching
observed at redshifts z<1.8. This decreasing trend is followed by a SFR enhancement starting at
about 5 Gyr ago and continuing until about 1 Gyr ago which is detected with high statistical significance
by discarding the null hypothesis of an exponential SFH with a p-value=0.002. We estimate, from
our best fit model, that about the 50% of the mass used to generate stars, along the thin disc life,
was expended in the period from 5 to 1 Gyr ago. The timescale and the amount of stellar mass generated
during the SFR enhancement event lead us to hypothesise that its origin, currently under investigation,
is not intrinsic to the disc. Thus, an external perturbation is needed for its explanation. Additionally
we find, for the thin disc, a slope of the IMF of $\alpha_3 \approx 2$ for masses M>1.53 Msun and $\alpha_2
\approx 1.3$ for the mass range between 0,5 and 1,53 Msun. This is the first time that we consider a
non-parametric SFH for the thin disc in the Besancon Galaxy Model. This new step, together with the
capabilities of the Gaia DR2 parallaxes to break degeneracies between different stellar populations,
allow us to better constrain the SFH and the IMF.
