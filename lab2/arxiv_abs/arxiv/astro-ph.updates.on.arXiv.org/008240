Thermal history models, that have been used to understand the geological history of Earth, are now
being coupled to climate models to map conditions that allow planets to maintain surface water over
geologic time - a criteria considered crucial for life. However, the lack of intrinsic uncertainty
assessment has blurred guidelines for how thermal history models can be used toward this end. A model,
as a representation of something real, is not expected to be complete. Unmodeled effects are assumed
to be small enough that the model maintains utility for the issue(s) it was designed to address. The
degree to which this holds depends on how unmodeled factors affect the certainty of model predictions.
We quantify this intrinsic uncertainty for several parameterized thermal history models (a widely
used subclass of planetary models). Single perturbation analysis is used to determine the reactance
time of different models. This provides a metric for how long it takes low amplitude, unmodeled effects
to decay or grow. Reactance time is shown to scale inversely with the strength of the dominant feedback
(negative or positive) within a model. A perturbed physics analysis is then used to determine uncertainty
shadows for model outputs. This provides probability distributions for model predictions and
tests the structural stability of a model. That is, do model predictions remain qualitatively similar,
and within assumed model limits, in the face of intrinsic uncertainty. Once intrinsic uncertainty
is accounted for, model outputs/predictions and comparisons to observational data should be treated
in a probabilistic way.
