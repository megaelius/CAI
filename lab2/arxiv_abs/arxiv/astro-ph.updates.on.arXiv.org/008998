We present a visible-light full orbital phase curve of the transiting planet WASP-18b measured
by the TESS Mission. The phase curve includes the transit, secondary eclipse, and sinusoidal modulations
across the orbital phase shaped by the planet's atmospheric characteristics and the star-planet
gravitational interaction. We measure the beaming (Doppler boosting) and tidal ellipsoidal distortion
phase modulations and show that the amplitudes of both agree with theoretical expectations. We
find that the light from the planet's day-side hemisphere occulted during secondary eclipse, with
a relative brightness of $341_{-18}^{+17}$ ppm, is dominated by thermal emission, leading to an
upper limit on the geometric albedo in the TESS band of 0.048 (2$\sigma$). We also detect the phase
modulation due to the planet's atmosphere longitudinal brightness distribution. We find that
its maximum is well-aligned with the sub-stellar point, to within 2.9 deg (2$\sigma$). We do not
detect light from the planet's night-side hemisphere, with an upper limit of 43 ppm (2$\sigma$),
which is 13 % of the day-side brightness. The low albedo, lack of atmospheric phase shift, and inefficient
heat distribution from the day to night hemispheres that we deduce from our analysis are consistent
with theoretical expectations and similar findings for other strongly irradiated gas giant planets.
This work demonstrates the potential of TESS data for studying full orbital phase curves of transiting
systems. Finally, we complement our study by looking for transit timing variations (TTVs) in the
TESS data and combined with previously published transit times, although we do not find a statistically
significant TTV signal.
