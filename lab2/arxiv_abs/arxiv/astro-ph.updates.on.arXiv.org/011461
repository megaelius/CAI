The ctools open-source software package was developed for the scientific analysis of astronomical
data from Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), such as H.E.S.S., VERITAS, MAGIC, and the future
Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). To date, the software has been mainly tested using simulated CTA
data; however, upon the public release of a small set of H.E.S.S. observations of the Crab nebula,
MSH 15-52, RX J1713.7-3946, and PKS 2155-304 validation using real data is now possible. We analysed
the data of the H.E.S.S. public data release using ctools version 1.6 and compared our results to
those published by the H.E.S.S. Collaboration for the respective sources. We developed a parametric
background model that satisfactorily describes the expected background rate as a function of reconstructed
energy and direction for each observation. We used that model, and tested all analysis methods that
are supported by ctools, including novel unbinned and joint or stacked binned analyses of the measured
event energies and reconstructed directions, and classical On-Off analysis methods that are comparable
to those used by the H.E.S.S. Collaboration. For all analysis methods, we found a good agreement
between the ctools results and the H.E.S.S. Collaboration publications considering that they
are not always directly comparable due to differences in the datatsets and event processing software.
We also performed a joint analysis of H.E.S.S. and Fermi-LAT data of the Crab nebula, illustrating
the multi-wavelength capacity of ctools. The joint Crab nebula spectrum is compatible with published
literature values within the systematic uncertainties. We conclude that the ctools software is
mature for the analysis of data from existing IACTs, as well as from the upcoming CTA.
