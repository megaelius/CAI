We have carried out continuum and line polarisation observations of two Proto-planetary nebulae
(PPNe), CRL 618 and OH 231.8+4.2, using the Submillimeter Array (SMA) in its compact configuration.
The frequency range of observations, 330-345 GHz, includes the CO(J=3-2) line emission. CRL 618
and OH 231.8+4.2 show quadrupolar and bipolar optical lobes, respectively, surrounded by a dusty
envelope reminiscent of their AGB phase. We report a detection of dust continuum polarised emission
in both PPNe above 4 sigma but no molecular line polarisation detection above a 3 sigma limit. OH 231.8+4.2
is slightly more polarised on average than CRL 618 with a mean fractional polarisation of 4.3 and
0.3 per cent, respectively. This agrees with the previous finding that silicate dust shows higher
polarisation than carbonaceous dust. In both objects, an anti-correlation between the fractional
polarisation and the intensity is observed. Neither PPNe show a well defined toroidal equatorial
field, rather the field is generally well aligned and organised along the polar direction. This
is clearly seen in CRL 618 while in the case of OH 231.8+4.2, the geometry indicates an X-shaped structure
coinciding overall with a dipole/polar configuration. However in the later case, the presence
of a fragmented and weak toroidal field should not be discarded. Finally, in both PPNe, we observed
that the well organised magnetic field is parallel with the major axis of the 12CO outflow. This alignment
could indicate the presence of a magnetic outflow launching mechanism. Based on our new high resolution
data we propose two scenarios to explain the evolution of the magnetic field in evolved stars.
