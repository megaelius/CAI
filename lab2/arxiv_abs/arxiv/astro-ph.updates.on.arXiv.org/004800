The existence (and abundance) of primordial black holes (PBHs) is governed by the power spectrum
of primordial perturbations generated during inflation. So far no PBHs have been observed, and
instead, increasingly stringent bounds on their existence at different scales have been obtained.
Up until recently, this has been exploited in attempts to constrain parts of the inflationary power
spectrum that are unconstrained by cosmological observations. We first point out that the simple
translation of the PBH non-observation bounds into constraints on the primordial power spectrum
is inaccurate as it fails to include realistic aspects of PBH formation and evolution. We then demonstrate,
by studying two examples of uncertainties from the effects of critical and non-spherical collapse,
that even though they may seem small, they have important implications for the usefulness of the
constraints. In particular, we point out that the uncertainty induced by non-spherical collapse
may be much larger than the difference between particular bounds from PBH non-observations and
the general maximum cap stemming from the condition $\Omega \leq 1$ on the dark-matter density in
the form of PBHs. We therefore make the cautious suggestion of applying only the overall maximum
dark-matter constraint to models of early Universe, as this requirement seems to currently provide
a more reliable constraint, which better reflects our current lack of detailed knowledge of PBH
formation. These, and other effects, such as merging, clustering and accretion, may also loosen
constraints from non-observations of other primordial compact objects such as ultra-compact
minihalos of dark matter.
