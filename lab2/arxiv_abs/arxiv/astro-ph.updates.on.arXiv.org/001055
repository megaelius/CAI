We characterize the bulge, disk, and halo subcomponents in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) over the radial
range 4 < R_proj < 225 kpc. The cospatial nature of these subcomponents renders them difficult
to disentangle using surface brightness (SB) information alone, especially interior to ~20 kpc.
Our new decomposition technique combines information from the luminosity function (LF) of over
1.5 million bright (20 < m_814W < 22) stars from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury
(PHAT) survey, radial velocities of over 5000 red giant branch stars in the same magnitude range
from the Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo (SPLASH) survey,
and integrated I-band SB profiles from various sources. We use an affine-invariant Markov chain
Monte Carlo algorithm to fit an appropriate toy model to these three data sets. The bulge, disk, and
halo SB profiles are modeled as a Sersic, exponential, and cored power-law, respectively, and the
LFs are modeled as broken power-laws. We present probability distributions for each of 32 parameters
describing the SB profiles and LFs of the three subcomponents. We find that the number of stars with
a disk-like LF is ~5% larger than the the number with disk-like (dynamically cold) kinematics, suggesting
that some stars born in the disk have been dynamically heated to the point that they are kinematically
indistinguishable from halo members. This is the first kinematical evidence for a "kicked-up disk"
halo population in M31. The fraction of kicked-up disk stars is consistent with that found in simulations.
We also find evidence for a radially varying disk LF, consistent with a negative metallicity gradient
in the stellar disk.
