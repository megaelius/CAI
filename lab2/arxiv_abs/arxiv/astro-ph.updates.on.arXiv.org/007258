High-energy emission of extragalactic objects is known to take place in relativistic jets, but
the nature, the location, and the emission processes of the emitting particles are still unknown.
One of the models proposed to explain the formation of relativistic ejections and their associated
non-thermal emission is the two-flow model, where the jets are supposed to be composed of two different
flows, a mildly relativistic baryonic jet surrounding a fast, relativistically moving electron-positron
plasma. Here we present the simulation of the emission of such a structure taking into account the
main sources of photons that are present in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We reproduce the broadband
spectra of radio-loud AGNs with a detailed model of emission taking into account synchrotron and
inverse-Compton emission by a relativistically moving beam of electron-positron, heated by a
surrounding turbulent baryonic jet. We compute the density and energy distribution of a relativistic
pair plasma all along a jet, taking into account the synchrotron and inverse-Compton process on
the various photon sources present in the core of the AGN, as well as the pair creation and annihilation
processes. We use semi-analytical approximations to quickly compute the inverse-Compton process
on a thermal photon distribution with any anisotropic angular distribution. The anisotropy of
the photon field is also responsible for the bulk acceleration of the pair plasma through the "Compton
rocket" effect, thus imposing the plasma velocity along the jet. As an example, the simulated emerging
spectrum is compared to the broadband emission of 3C273. In the case of 3C273, we obtain an excellent
fit of the average broadband energy distribution by assuming physical parameters compatible with
known estimates.
