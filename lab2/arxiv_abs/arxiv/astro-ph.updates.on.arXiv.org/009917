A fundamental property determining the transient behaviour of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe)
is the amount of radioactive $^{56}$Ni synthesised in the explosion. Using established methods,
this is a relatively easy parameter to extract from observations. Here I provide a meta analysis
of all published $^{56}$Ni masses for CCSNe. Collating a total of 258 literature $^{56}$Ni masses
I compare distributions of the main CCSN types: SNeII; SNeIIb; SNeIb; SNeIc; and SNeIcBL. Using
these published values, I calculate a median $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.032${\rm\ M}_\odot$ for SNeII
(N=115), 0.102${\rm\ M}_\odot$ (N=27) for SNeIIb, SNeIb = 0.163${\rm\ M}_\odot$ (N=33), SNeIc
= 0.155${\rm\ M}_\odot$ (N=48), and SNeIcBL = 0.369${\rm\ M}_\odot$ (N=32). On average, stripped-enevelope
SNe (SE-SNe: IIb; Ib; Ic; and Ic-BL) have much higher values than SNeII. These observed distributions
are compared to those predicted from neutrino-driven explosion models. While the SNII distribution
follows model predictions, the SE-SNe have a significant fraction of events with $^{56}$Ni masses
much higher than predicted. If the majority of published $^{56}$Ni masses are to be believed, these
results imply significant differences in the progenitor structures and/or explosion properties
between SNeII and SE-SNe. However, such distinct progenitor and explosion properties are not currently
favoured in the literature. Alternatively, the popular methods used to estimate $^{56}$Ni masses
for SE-SNe may not be accurate. Possible issues with these methods are discussed, as are the implications
of true $^{56}$Ni mass differences on progenitor properties of different CCSNe.
