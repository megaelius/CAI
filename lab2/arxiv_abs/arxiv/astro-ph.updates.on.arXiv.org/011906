The AGB star $\pi^{1}$ Gruis has a known companion (at a separation of ~400 AU) which cannot explain
the strong deviations from the spherical symmetry of the CSE. Recently, hydrodynamic simulations
of mass transfer in closer binary systems have successfully reproduced the spiral-shaped CSEs
found around a handful of sources. There is growing evidence for an even closer, undetected companion
complicating the case of $\pi^{1}$ Gruis further. The improved spatial resolution allows for the
investigation of the complex circumstellar morphology and the search for imprints on the CSE of
the third component. We have observed the 12CO J=3-2 line emission from $\pi^{1}$ Gruis using both
the compact and extended array of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The interferometric
data has furthermore been combined with data from the ALMA total power (TP) array. The imaged brightness
distribution has been used to constrain a non-local, non-LTE 3D radiative transfer model of the
CSE. The high-angular resolution ALMA data have revealed the first example of a source on the AGB
where both a faster bipolar outflow and a spiral pattern along the orbital plane can be seen in the
gas envelope. The spiral can be traced in the low- to intermediate velocity, from 13 to 25 km s$^{-1}$,
equatorial torus. The largest spiral-arm separation is $\approx$5".5 and consistent with a companion
with an orbital period of $\approx$330 yrs and a separation of less than 70 AU. The kinematics of the
bipolar outflow is consistent with it being created during a mass-loss eruption where the mass-loss
rate from the system increased by at least a factor of 5 during 10-15 yrs. The spiral pattern is the
result of an undetected companion. The bipolar outflow is the result of a rather recent mass-loss
eruption event.
