The VST Optical Imaging of the CDFS and ES1 Fields (VOICE) Survey is proposed to obtain deep optical
$ugri$ imaging of the CDFS and ES1 fields using the VLT Survey Telescope (VST). At present, the observations
for the CDFS field have been completed, and comprise in total about 4.9 deg$^2$ down to $r_\mathrm{AB}$$\sim$26
mag. In the companion paper by Fu et al. (2018), we present the weak lensing shear measurements for
$r$-band images with seeing $\le$ 0.9 arcsec. In this paper, we perform image simulations to calibrate
possible biases of the measured shear signals. Statistically, the properties of the simulated
point spread function (PSF) and galaxies show good agreements with those of observations. The multiplicative
bias is calibrated to reach an accuracy of $\sim$3.0%. We study the bias sensitivities to the undetected
faint galaxies and to the neighboring galaxies. We find that undetected galaxies contribute to
the multiplicative bias at the level of $\sim$0.3%. Further analysis shows that galaxies with lower
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are impacted more significantly because the undetected galaxies
skew the background noise distribution. For the neighboring galaxies, we find that although most
have been rejected in the shape measurement procedure, about one third of them still remain in the
final shear sample. They show a larger ellipticity dispersion and contribute to $\sim$0.2% of the
multiplicative bias. Such a bias can be removed by further eliminating these neighboring galaxies.
But the effective number density of the galaxies can be reduced considerably. Therefore efficient
methods should be developed for future weak lensing deep surveys.
