We suggest a common physical origin connecting the fast, highly ionized winds (UFOs) seen in nearby
AGN, and the slower and less ionized winds of BAL QSOs. The primary difference is the mass loss rate
in the wind, which is ultimately determined by the rate at which mass is fed towards the central supermassive
black hole (SMBH) on large scales. This is below the Eddington accretion rate in most UFOs, and slightly
super-Eddington in extreme UFOs such as PG1211+143, but ranges up to $\sim 10-50$ times this in BAL
QSOs. For UFOs this implies black hole accretion rates and wind mass loss rates which are at most comparable
to Eddington, giving fast, highly-ionized winds. In contrast BAL QSO black holes have mildly super-Eddington
accretion rates, and drive winds whose mass loss rates are significantly super-Eddington, and
so are slower and less ionized. This picture correctly predicts the velocities and ionization states
of the observed winds, including the recently-discovered one in SDSS J1106+1939. We suggest that
luminous AGN may evolve through a sequence from BAL QSO through LoBAL to UFO-producing Seyfert or
quasar as their Eddington factors drop during the decay of a bright accretion event. LoBALs correspond
to a short-lived stage in which the AGN radiation pressure largely evacuates the ionization cone,
but before the large-scale accretion rate has dropped to the Eddington value. We show that sub-Eddington
wind rates would produce an $M - \sigma$ relation lying above that observed. We conclude that significant
SMBH mass growth must occur in super-Eddington phases, either as BAL QSOs, extreme UFOs, or obscured
from direct observation.
