The K-type binary star HD 102077 was proposed as a candidate member of the TW Hydrae Association (TWA)
which is a young (5-15 Myr) moving group in close proximity (~50 pc) to the solar system. The aim of
this work is to verify this hypothesis by different means. We first combine diffraction-limited
observations from the ESO NTT 3.5m telescope in SDSS-i' and -z' passbands and ESO 3.6m telescope
in H-band with literature data to obtain a new, amended orbit fit, estimate the spectral types of
both components, and reanalyse the Hipparcos parallax and proper motion taking the orbital motion
into account. Moreover, we use two high-resolution spectra of HD 102077 obtained with the fibre-fed
optical echelle spectrograph FEROS at the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope to determine the radial velocity
and the lithium equivalent width of the system. The trajectory of HD 102077 is well constrained and
we derive a total system mass of $2.6 \pm 0.8\,$ M$_{\odot}$ and a semi-major axis of $14.9 \pm 1.6\,$AU.
From the i'-z' colours we infer an integrated spectral type of K2V, and individual spectral types
of K0 +/- 1 and K5 +/- 1. The radial velocity corrected for the orbital motion of the system is $17.6
\pm 2\,$km/s. Even though the parallax determination from the Hipparcos data is not influenced
by the orbital motion, the proper motion changes to $\mu_\alpha*\cos(\delta) = -137.84 \pm 1.26\,$
mas/yr and $\mu_\delta = -33.53 \pm 1.45 \,$mas/yr. With the resultant space motion, the probability
of HD 102077 being a member of TWA is less than 1%. Furthermore, the lithium equivalent width of $200
\pm 4\,$m\AA $\,$ is consistent with an age between 30 Myr and 120 Myr and thus older than the predicted
age of TWA. In conclusion, HD 102077's age, galactic space motion, and position do not fit TWA or any
other young moving group.
