Debris disks are the intrinsic by-products of the star and planet formation processes. Most likely
due to instrumental limitations and their natural faintness, little is known about debris disks
around low-mass stars, especially when it comes to spatially resolved observations. We present
new VLT/SPHERE IRDIS Dual-Polarization Imaging (DPI) observations in which we detect the dust
ring around the M2 spectral type star TWA\,7. Combined with additional Angular Differential Imaging
observations we aim at a fine characterization of the debris disk and setting constraints on the
presence of low-mass planets. We model the SPHERE DPI observations and constrain the location of
the small dust grains, as well as the spectral energy distribution of the debris disk, using the results
inferred from the observations, and perform simple N-body simulations. We find that the dust density
distribution peaks at 25 au, with a very shallow outer power-law slope, and that the disk has an inclination
of 13 degrees with a position angle of 90 degrees East of North. We also report low signal-to-noise
detections of an outer belt at a distance of ~52 au from the star, of a spiral arm in the Southern side
of the star, and of a possible dusty clump at 3.9 au. These findings seem to persist over timescales
of at least a year. Using the intensity images, we do not detect any planets in the close vicinity of
the star, but the sensitivity reaches Jovian planet mass upper limits. We find that the SED is best
reproduced with an inner disk at 7 au and another belt at 25 au. We report the detections of several
unexpected features in the disk around TWA\,7. A yet undetected 100 M$_\oplus$ planet with a semi-major
axis at 20-30 au could possibly explain the outer belt as well as the spiral arm. We conclude that stellar
winds are unlikely to be responsible for the spiral arm.
