High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy has advanced our understanding of the hot Universe by revealing
physical properties like kinematics, temperature, and abundances of the astrophysical plasmas.
Despite the technical and scientific achievements, the lack of scientific products at a level higher
than count spectra is hampering full scientific exploitation of high-quality data. This paper
introduces the Catalogue of Ionized Emission Lines Observed by the Reflection Grating Spectrometer
(CIELO-RGS) onboard the XMM-Newton space observatory. The CIELO-RGS catalogue aims to facilitate
the exploitation of emission features in the public RGS spectra archive, in particular, to perform
the correlation between X-ray spectral diagnostics parameters with measurements at other wavelengths.
This paper focuses on the methodology of catalogue generation, describing the automated line detection
algorithm. A moderate sample (~2400 observations) of high-quality RGS spectra available at XMM-Newton
Science Archive is used as our starting point. A list of potential emission lines is selected based
on a multi-scale peak detection algorithm in a uniform and automated way without prior assumption
on the underlying astrophysical model. The candidate line list is validated via spectral fitting
with simple continuum and line profile models. We also compare the catalogue content with published
literature results on a small number of exemplary sources. We generate a catalogue of emission lines
~12000 detected in ~1600 observations toward stars, X-ray binaries, supernovae remnants, active
galactic nuclei, and groups and clusters of galaxies. For each line, we report the observed wavelength,
broadening, energy and photon flux, and equivalent width, etc.
