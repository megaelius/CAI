The atmospheres of the four giant planets of our Solar System share a common and well-observed characteristic:
they each display patterns of planetary banding, with regions of different temperatures, composition,
aerosol properties and dynamics separated by strong meridional and vertical gradients in the zonal
(i.e., east-west) winds. On Jupiter, the reflective white bands of low temperatures, elevated
aerosol opacities, and enhancements of quasi-conserved chemical tracers are referred to as 'zones.'
Conversely, the darker bands of warmer temperatures, depleted aerosols, and reductions of chemical
tracers are known as `belts.' On Saturn, we define cyclonic belts and anticyclonic zones via their
temperature and wind characteristics, although their relation to Saturn's albedo is not as clear
as on Jupiter. On distant Uranus and Neptune, the exact relationships between the banded albedo
contrasts and the environmental properties is a topic of active study. This review is an attempt
to reconcile the observed properties of belts and zones with (i) the meridional overturning inferred
from the convergence of eddy angular momentum into the eastward zonal jets at the cloud level on Jupiter
and Saturn and the prevalence of moist convective activity in belts; and (ii) the opposing meridional
motions inferred from the upper tropospheric temperature structure, which implies decay and dissipation
of the zonal jets with altitude above the clouds. These two scenarios suggest meridional circulations
in opposing directions, the former suggesting upwelling in belts, the latter suggesting upwelling
in zones. This presents an unresolved paradox for our current understanding of the banded structure
of giant planet atmospheres, that could be addressed via a multi-tiered vertical structure of 'stacked
circulation cells.' [Abridged]
