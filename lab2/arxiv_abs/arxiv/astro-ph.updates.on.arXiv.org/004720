Formamide (NH2CHO) and methylamine (CH3NH2) are known to be the most abundant amine-containing
molecules in many astrophysical environments. The presence of these molecules in the gas phase
may result from thermal desorption of interstellar ices. The aim of this work is to determine the
values of the desorption energies of formamide and methylamine from analogues of interstellar
dust grain surfaces and to understand their interaction with water ice. TPD experiments of formamide
and methylamine ices were performed in the submonolayer and monolayer regimes on graphite (HOPG)
and non-porous amorphous solid water ice surfaces at 40-240 K. The desorption energy distributions
of these two molecules were calculated from TPD measurements using a set of independent Polanyi-Wigner
equations. The maximum of the desorption of formamide from both graphite and ASW ice surfaces occurs
at 176 K after the desorption of H2O molecules, whereas the desorption profile of methylamine depends
strongly on the substrate. Solid methylamine starts to desorb below 100 K from the graphite surface.
Its desorption from the water ice surface occurs after 120 K and stops during the water ice sublimation
around 150 K. It continues to desorb from the graphite surface at temperatures higher than 160 K.
More than 95 % of NH2CHO diffuses through the water ice surface towards the graphitic substrate and
is released into the gas phase with a desorption energy distribution (7460-9380 K), which is measured
with the best-fit pre-exponential factor A=10^18 s-1. However, the desorption energy distribution
of methylamine from the np-ASW ice surface (3850-8420 K) is measured with the best-fit pre-exponential
factor A=10^12 s-1. A fraction of solid methylamine monolayer of roughly 0.15 diffuses through
the water ice surface towards the HOPG substrate. This small amount desorbs later with higher binding
energies (5050-8420 K).
