Clouds are ubiquitous in extrasolar planet atmospheres and are critical to our understanding of
planetary climate and chemistry. They also represent one of the greater challenges to overcome
when trying to interpret transit transmission spectra of exoplanet atmospheres as their presence
can inhibit precise constraints on atmospheric composition and thermal properties. In this work
we take a phenomenological approach towards understanding 1) our ability to constrain bulk cloud
properties, and 2) the impact of clouds on constraining various atmospheric properties as obtained
through transmission spectroscopy with the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)}. We do
this by exploring retrievals of atmospheric and cloud properties for a generic "hot-Jupiter" as
a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), \textit{JWST} observing modes and four different cloud
parameterizations. We find that most key atmospheric and cloud inferences can be well constrained
in the wavelength range ($\lambda = $ 0.6 - 11 $\mu$m), with NIRCam ($\lambda =$ 2.5 - 5 $\mu$m) being
critical in inferring atmospheric properties and NIRISS + MIRI ($\lambda =$ 0.6 - 2.5, 5 - 11 $\mu$m)
being necessary for good constraints on cloud parameters. However, constraining the cloud abundance
and therefore the total cloud mass requires an observable cloud base in the transit geometry. While
higher SNR observations can place tighter constraints on major parameters such as temperature,
metallicity and cloud sedimentation, they are unable to eliminate strong degeneracies among cloud
parameters. Our investigation of a generic "warm-Neptune" with photochemical haze parameterization
also shows promising results in constraining atmospheric and haze properties in the cooler temperature
regime.
