In this work we study the efficiency of galactic feedback in the early Universe by stacking the [C
II] 158um emission in a large sample of normal star-forming galaxies at 4 < z < 6, drawn from the ALMA
Large Program to INvestigate [C II] at Early times (ALPINE) survey. Searching for typical signatures
of outflows in the high-velocity tails of the stacked [C II] profile, we observe (i) deviations from
a single-component Gaussian model in the combined residuals and (ii) broad emission in the stacked
[C II] spectrum, at velocities of |v|<~ 500 km/s. Interestingly, the significance of these features
increases when stacking the sub-group of galaxies with star formation rates (SFRs) higher than
the median (SFRmed = 25 Msun/yr), confirming their star formation-driven nature. The estimated
typical mass outflow rates are comparable with the SFRs, yielding mass-loading factors of the order
of unity (similarly to local normal star-forming galaxies), thus suggesting that star formation-driven
feedback does not play a dominant role in quenching galaxies at z > 4. From the stacking analysis of
the datacubes, we find that the combined [C II] core emission (|v|< 200 km/s) of the higher SFR galaxies
extends on physical sizes of ~30 kpc (diameter scale), well beyond the analogous [C II] core emission
of lower SFR galaxies and the stacked FIR-continuum. The detection of such extended metal-enriched
gas, likely tracing circumgalactic gas enriched by past outflows, corroborates previous similar
studies, confirming that baryon cycle and gas exchanges with the circumgalactic medium are at work
in normal star-forming galaxies already at early epochs.
