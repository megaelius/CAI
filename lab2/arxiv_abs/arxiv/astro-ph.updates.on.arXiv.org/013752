Low surface brightness galactic stellar halos provide a challenging but promising path towards
unraveling the past assembly histories of individual galaxies. Here, we present detailed comparisons
between the stellar halos of Milky Way-mass disk galaxies observed as part of the Dragonfly Nearby
Galaxies Survey (DNGS) and stellar mass-matched galaxies in the TNG100 run of the IllustrisTNG
project. We produce stellar mass maps as well as mock $g$ and $r$-band images for randomly oriented
simulated galaxies, convolving the latter with the Dragonfly PSF and taking care to match the background
noise, surface brightness limits and spatial resolution of DNGS. We measure azimuthally averaged
stellar mass density and surface brightness profiles, and find that the DNGS galaxies generally
have less stellar mass (or light) at large radii (>20 kpc) compared to their mass-matched TNG100
counterparts, and that simulated galaxies with similar surface density profiles tend to have low
accreted mass fractions for their stellar mass. We explore potential solutions to this apparent
"missing outskirts problem" by implementing several ad-hoc adjustments within TNG100 at the stellar
particle level. Although we are unable to identify any single adjustment that fully reconciles
the differences between the observed and simulated galaxy outskirts, we find that artificially
delaying the disruption of satellite galaxies and reducing the spatial extent of in-situ stellar
populations result in improved matches between the outer profile shapes and stellar halo masses,
respectively. Further insight can be achieved with higher resolution simulations that are able
to better resolve satellite accretion, and with larger samples of observed galaxies.
