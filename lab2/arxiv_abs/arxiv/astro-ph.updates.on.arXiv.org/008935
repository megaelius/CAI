While recently discovered exotic new planet-types have both challenged our imaginations and broadened
our knowledge of planetary system workings, perhaps the most compelling objective of exoplanet
science is to detect and characterize habitable and possibly inhabited worlds orbiting in other
star systems. For the foreseeable future, characterizations of extrasolar planets will be made
via remote sensing of planetary spectroscopic and temporal signals, along with careful fitting
of this data to advanced models of planets and their atmospheres. Terrestrial planets are small
and significantly more challenging to observe compared to their larger gaseous brethren; however
observatories coming on-line in the coming decade will begin to allow their characterization.
Still, it is not enough to invest only in observational endeavors. Comprehensive modeling of planetary
atmospheres is required in order to fully understand what it is that our grand telescopes see in the
night-sky. In our quest to characterize habitable, and possibly inhabited worlds, 3D general circulation
models (GCMs) should be used to evaluate potential climate states and their associated temporal
and spatial dependent observable signals. 3D models allow for coupled, self-consistent, multi-dimensional
simulations, which can realistically simulate the climates of terrestrial extrasolar planets.
A complete theoretical understanding of terrestrial exoplanetary atmospheres, gained through
comprehensive 3D modeling, is critical for interpreting spectra of exoplanets taken from current
and planned instruments, and is critical for designing future missions that aim to measure spectra
of potentially habitable exoplanets as one of their key science goals. We recommend continued institutional
support for 3D GCM modeling teams that focus on planetary and exoplanetary applications.
