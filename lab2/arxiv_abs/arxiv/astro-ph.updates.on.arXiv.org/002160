We consider photometric reverberation mapping, where the nuclear continuum variations are monitored
via a broad-band filter and the echo of emission line clouds of the broad line region (BLR) is measured
with a suitable narrow-band (NB) filter. We investigate how an incomplete emission-line coverage
by the NB filter influences the BLR size determination. This includes two basic cases: 1) a symmetric
cut of the blue and red part of the line wings, and 2) the filter positioned asymmetrically to the line
centre so that essentially a complete half of the emission line is contained in the NB filter. Under
the assumption that the BLR size is dominated by circular Keplerian orbits, we find that symmetric
cutting of line wings may lead to overestimating the BLR size by less than 5%. The case of asymmetric
half-line coverage, similar as for our data of the Seyfert 1 galaxy 3C120, yields the BLR size with
a bias of less than 1%. Our results suggest that any BLR size bias due to narrow-band line cut in photometric
reverberation mapping is small and in most cases negligible. We used well sampled photometric reverberation
mapping light curves with sharp variation features in both the continuum and the Hbeta light curves
to determine the geometry type of the Hbeta BLR for 3C120. Modelling of the light curve, under the
assumption that the BLR is essentially virialised, argues against a spherical geometry and favours
a nearly face-on disk-like geometry with inclination i = 10 +/- 4 deg and extension from 22 to 28 light
days. The low inclination may lead to a larger black hole mass than the derived when using the average
geometry scaling factor f=5.5. We discuss deviations of Seyfert 1 galaxies from the M_BH - sigma
relation.
