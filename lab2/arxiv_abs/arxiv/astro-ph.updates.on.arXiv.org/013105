We propose a one-parameter extension to $\Lambda$CDM, expected to strongly affect cosmological
tensions. An effective dark radiation component in the early universe redshifts away as hot dark
matter, then quintessence, tracking the dominant equation-of-state parameter and leaving a falsifiable
torsion field in the current epoch. This picture results from a new Poincar\'e gauge theory (PGT),
one of the most promising among the latest batch of 58 PGTs found to be both power-counting renormalisable
and free from ghosts and tachyons. We systematically categorise the cosmologies of 33 of these PGTs,
as special cases of the most general parity-preserving, Ostrogradsky-stable PGT with a purely
Yang-Mills action. The theory we consider contains two propagating massless gravitons, which
may be $J^P=2^+$ (long-range gravitation and gravitational waves). A conspiracy among the coupling
constants eliminates the spatial curvature $k\in\{\pm 1,0\}$ from the field equations. We show
that this `$k$-screening' is not restricted to conformal gravity theories. The flat Friedmann
equations are then emergent, with potentially tension-resolving freedom at the early scale-invariant
epoch that reliably gives way to an attractor-like state of modern $\Lambda$CDM evolution. We compare
with related theories and promising special cases, such as $k$-screened theories with negative-definite
effective $k$, and more traditional theories with effective $\Lambda$ and a $J^P=0^-$ massive
graviton (dark matter candidate). As a bonus, we analyse similarly constrained actions in the new
extended Weyl gauge theory (eWGT). We show that in cosmology, PGT and eWGT span exactly the same classical
phenomenology up to a linear map between their coupling constants, hinting at a deeper relationship
between the two.
