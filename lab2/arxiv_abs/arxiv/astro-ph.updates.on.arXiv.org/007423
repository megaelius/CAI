The Space Technology 7 Disturbance Reduction System (ST7-DRS) is a NASA technology demonstration
payload that operated from January 2016 through July of 2017 on the European Space Agency's LISA
Pathfinder spacecraft. The joint goal of the NASA and ESA missions was to validate key technologies
for a future space-based gravitational wave observatory targeting the source-rich milliHertz
band. The two primary components of ST7-DRS are a micropropulsion system based on colloidal micro-Newton
thrusters (CMNTs) and a control system that simultaneously controls the attitude and position
of the spacecraft and the two free-flying test masses (TMs). This paper presents our main experimental
results and summarizes the overall the performance of the CMNTs and control laws. We find that the
CMNT performance to be consistent with pre-flight predictions, with a measured system thrust noise
on the order of $100\,\textrm{nN}/\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ in the $1\,\textrm{mHz}\leq f \leq 30\,\textrm{mHz}$
band. The control system maintained the TM-spacecraft separation with an RMS error of less than
2$\,$nm and a noise spectral density of less than $3\,\textrm{nm}/\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ in the
same band. Thruster calibration measurements yield thrust values consistent with the performance
model and ground-based thrust-stand measurements, to within a few percent. We also report a differential
acceleration noise between the two test masses with a spectral density of roughly $3\,\textrm{fm}/\textrm{s}^2/\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$
in the $1\,\textrm{mHz}\leq f \leq 30\,\textrm{mHz}$ band, slightly less than twice as large as
the best performance reported with the baseline LISA Pathfinder configuration and below the current
requirements for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission.
