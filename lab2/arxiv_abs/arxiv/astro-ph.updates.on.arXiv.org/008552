The aim of this study is to demonstrate how the logarithmic millimeter continuum gradient observed
using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) may be used to estimate optical
thickness in the solar atmosphere. We discuss how using multi-wavelength millimeter measurements
can refine plasma analysis through knowledge of the absorption mechanisms. Here we use sub-band
observations from the publicly available science verification (SV) data, whilst our methodology
will also be applicable to regular ALMA data. The spectral resolving capacity of ALMA SV data is tested
using the enhancement coincident with an X-ray Bright Point (XBP) and from a plasmoid ejection event
near active region NOAA12470 observed in Band 3 (84-116 GHz) on 17/12/2015. We compute the interferometric
brightness temperature light-curve for both features at each of the four constituent sub-bands
to find the logarithmic millimetre spectrum. We compared the observed logarithmic spectral gradient
with the derived relationship with optical thickness for an isothermal plasma to estimate the structure's
optical thicknesses. We conclude, within 90% confidence, that the stationary enhancement has
an optical thickness between $0.02 \leq \tau \leq 2.78$, and that the moving enhancement has $0.11
\leq \tau \leq 2.78$, thus both lie near to the transition between optically thin and thick plasma
at 100 GHz. From these estimates, isothermal plasmas with typical Band 3 background brightness
temperatures would be expected to have electron temperatures of $\sim 7370 - 15300$ K for the stationary
enhancement and between $\sim 7440 - 9560$ K for the moving enhancement, thus demonstrating the
benefit of sub-band ALMA spectral analysis.
