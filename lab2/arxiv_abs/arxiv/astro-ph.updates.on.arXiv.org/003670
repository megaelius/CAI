Planetesimal formation stage represents a major gap in our understanding of the planet formation
process. The late-stage planet accretion models typically make arbitrary assumptions about planetesimals
and pebbles distribution while the dust evolution models predict that planetesimal formation
is only possible at some orbital distances. We want to test the importance of water snow line for triggering
formation of the first planetesimals during the gas-rich phase of protoplanetary disk, when cores
of giant planets have to form. We connect prescriptions for gas disk evolution, dust growth and fragmentation,
water ice evaporation and recondensation, as well as transport of both solids and water vapor, and
planetesimal formation via streaming instability into a single, one-dimensional model for protoplanetary
disk evolution. We find that processes taking place around the snow line facilitate planetesimal
formation in two ways. First, due to the change of sticking properties between wet and dry aggregates,
there is a "traffic jam" inside of the snow line that slows down the fall of solids onto the star. Second,
ice evaporation and outward diffusion of water followed by its recondensation increases the abundance
of icy pebbles that trigger planetesimal formation via streaming instability just outside of the
snow line. Planetesimal formation is hindered by growth barriers and radial drift and thus requires
particular conditions to take place. Snow line is a favorable location where planetesimal formation
is possible for a wide range of conditions, but still not in every protoplanetary disk model. This
process is particularly promoted in large, cool disks with low intrinsic turbulence and increased
initial dust-to-gas ratio.
