The semi-empirical initial-final mass relation (IFMR) connects spectroscopically analyzed
white dwarfs in star clusters to the initial masses of the stars that formed them. Most current stellar
evolution models, however, predict that stars will evolve to white dwarfs $\sim$0.1 M$_\odot$
less massive than that found in the IFMR. We first look at how varying theoretical mass-loss rates,
third dredge-up efficiencies, and convective-core overshoot may help explain the differences
between models and observations. These parameters play an important role at the lowest masses (M$_{\rm
initial}$ $<$ 3 M$_\odot$). At higher masses, only convective-core overshoot meaningfully affects
white dwarf mass, but alone it likely cannot explain the observed white dwarf masses nor why the IFMR
scatter is larger than observational errors predict. These higher masses, however, are also where
rotational mixing in main sequence stars begins to create more massive cores, and hence more massive
white dwarfs. This rotational mixing also extends a star's lifetime, making faster rotating progenitors
appear like less massive stars in their semi-empirical age analysis. Applying the observed range
of young B-dwarf rotations to the MIST or SYCLIST rotational models demonstrates a marked improvement
in reproducing both the observed IFMR data and its scatter. The incorporation of both rotation and
efficient convective-core overshoot significantly improves the match with observations. This
work shows that the IFMR provides a valuable observational constraint on how rotation and convective-core
overshoot affect the core evolution of a star.
