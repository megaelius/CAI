The existence of mixed modes in stars is a marker of stellar evolution. Their detection serves for
a better determination of stellar age. The goal of this paper is to identify the dipole modes in an
automatic manner without human intervention. I use the power spectra obtained by the Kepler mission
for the application of the method. I compute asymptotic dipole mode frequencies as a function of
coupling factor and dipole period spacing, and other parameters. For each star, I collapse the power
in an echelle diagramme aligned onto the monopole and dipole mixed modes. The power at the null frequency
is used as a figure of merit. Using a genetic algorithm, I then optimise the figure of merit by adjusting
the location of the dipole frequencies in the power spectrum}. Using published frequencies, I compare
the asymptotic dipole mode frequencies with published frequencies. I also used published frequencies
for deriving coupling factor and dipole period spacing using a non-linear least squares fit. I use
Monte-Carlo simulations of the non-linear least square fit for deriving error bars for each parameters.
From the 44 subgiants studied, the automatic identification allows to retrieve within 3 $\mu$Hz
at least 80\% of the modes for 32 stars, and within 6 $\mu$Hz at least 90% of the modes for 37 stars. The
optimised and fitted gravity-mode period spacing and coupling factor agree with previous measurements.
Random errors for the mixed-mode parameters deduced from Monte-Carlo simulation are about 30-50
times smaller than previously determined errors, which are in fact systematic errors. The period
spacing and coupling factors of mixed modes in subgiants are confirmed. The current automated procedure
will need to be improved using a more accurate asymptotic model and/or proper statistical tests.
