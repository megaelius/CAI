We revisit the interpretation of blue-excess molecular lines from dense collapsing cores, considering
recent numerical results that suggest prestellar core collapse occurs from the outside-in, and
not inside-out. We thus create synthetic molecular-line observations of simulated collapsing,
spherically-symmetric, density fluctuations of low initial amplitude, embedded in a uniform,
globally gravitationally unstable background, without a turbulent component. The collapsing
core develops a flattened, Bonnor-Ebert-like density profile, but with an outside-in radial velocity
profile, where the peak infall speeds are at large radii, in lower density gas, with cloud-to-core
accretion, and no hydrostatic outer envelope. Using optically thick HCO$^+$ J=1-0 and 3-2 rotational
lines, we consider several "typical" beamwidths and use a simple line-fitting model to infer infall
speeds from the synthetic profiles similarly to what is done in standard line modeling. We find that
the inferred infall speeds are ~ 25-30% of the actual peak infall speed as the largest speeds are downweighted
by the low density gas in which they occur, due to the outside-in nature of the actual radial collapse
profile. Also, with the N$_2$H$^+$ $J_{F_1F}=1_{01}-0_{12}$ hyperfine line, we investigate
the change in the asymmetry parameter, $\delta v\equiv(V_{thick}-V_{thin})/\Delta v_{thin}$,
during the collapse, finding good agreement with observed values. Finally, the HCO$^+$ J=3-2 lines
exhibit extreme $T_b$/$T_r$-ratios like those for evolved cores, for larger beams late in the collapse.
Our results suggest that standard dynamical infall reproduces several observed features, but
that low-mass core infall speeds are generally undervalued, often interpreted as being subsonic
although the actual speeds are supersonic, due to incorrectly assuming an inside-out infall radial
velocity profile with a static outer envelope.
