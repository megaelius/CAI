Asteroid mining offers the possibility to revolutionize supply of resources vital for human civilization.
Preliminary analysis suggests that Near-Earth Asteroids (NEA) contain enough volatile and high
value minerals to make the mining process economically feasible. Considering possible applications,
specifically the mining of water in space has become a major focus for near-term options. Most proposed
projects for asteroid mining involve spacecraft based on traditional designs resulting in large,
monolithic and expensive systems. An alternative approach is presented in this paper, basing the
asteroid mining process on multiple small spacecraft. To the best knowledge of the authors, only
limited analysis of the asteroid mining capability of small spacecraft has been conducted. This
paper explores the possibility to perform asteroid mining operations with spacecraft that have
a mass under 500 kg and deliver 100 kg of water per trip. The mining process considers water extraction
through microwave heating with an efficiency of 2 Wh/g.The proposed, small spacecraft can reach
NEAs within a range of $\sim 0.03$ AU relative to earth's orbit, offering a delta V of 437 m/s per one-way
trip. A high-level systems engineering and economic analysis provides a closed spacecraft design
as a baseline and puts the cost of the proposed spacecraft at $ 113.6 million/unit. The results indicate
that more than one hundred spacecraft and their successful operation for over five years are required
to achieve a financial break-even point. Pros and cons of using small spacecraft swarms are highlighted
and the uncertainties associated with cost and profit of space related business ventures are analyzed.
