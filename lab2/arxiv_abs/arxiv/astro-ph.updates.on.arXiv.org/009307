We present observations of the C-band $1_{10}-1_{11}$ (4.8 GHz) and Ku-band $2_{11}-2_{12}$ (14.5
GHz) K-doublet lines of H$_2$CO and the C-band $1_{10}-1_{11}$ (4.6 GHz) line of H$_2$$^{13}$CO
toward a large sample of Galactic molecular clouds, through the Shanghai Tianma 65-m radio telescope
(TMRT). Our sample with 112 sources includes strong H$_2$CO sources from the TMRT molecular line
survey at C-band and other known H$_2$CO sources. All three lines are detected toward 38 objects
(43 radial velocity components) yielding a detection rate of 34\%. Complementary observations
of their continuum emission at both C- and Ku-bands were performed. Combining spectral line parameters
and continuum data, we calculate the column densities, the optical depths and the isotope ratio
H$_2$$^{12}$CO/H$_2$$^{13}$CO for each source. To evaluate photon trapping caused by sometimes
significant opacities in the main isotopologue's rotational mm-wave lines connecting our measured
K-doublets, and to obtain $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C abundance ratios, we used the RADEX non-LTE model
accounting for radiative transfer effects. This implied the use of the new collision rates from
\citet{Wiesenfeld2013}. Also implementing distance values from trigonometric parallax measurements
for our sources, we obtain a linear fit of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = (5.08$\pm$1.10)D$_{GC}$ + (11.86$\pm$6.60),
with a correlation coefficient of 0.58. D$_{GC}$ refers to Galactocentric distances. Our $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C
ratios agree very well with the ones deduced from CN and C$^{18}$O but are lower than those previously
reported on the basis of H$_2$CO, tending to suggest that the bulk of the H$_2$CO in our sources was
formed on dust grain mantles and not in the gas phase.
