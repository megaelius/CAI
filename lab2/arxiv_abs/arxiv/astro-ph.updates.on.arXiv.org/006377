Extended results on the cosmic-ray electron + positron spectrum from 11 GeV to 4.8 TeV are presented
based on observations with the Calorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET) on the International Space
Station utilizing the data up to November 2017. The analysis uses the full detector acceptance at
high energies, approximately doubling the statistics compared to the previous result. CALET is
an all-calorimetric instrument with a total thickness of 30 $X_0$ at normal incidence and fine imaging
capability, designed to achieve large proton rejection and excellent energy resolution well into
the TeV energy region. The observed energy spectrum in the region below 1 TeV shows good agreement
with Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) data. In the energy region below $\sim$300 GeV, CALET's
spectral index is found to be consistent with the AMS-02, Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT)
and Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE), while from 300 to 600 GeV the spectrum is significantly
softer than the spectra from the latter two experiments. The absolute flux of CALET is consistent
with other experiments at around a few tens of GeV. However, it is lower than those of DAMPE and Fermi-LAT
with the difference increasing up to several hundred GeV. The observed energy spectrum above $\sim$1
TeV suggests a flux suppression consistent within the errors with the results of DAMPE, while CALET
does not observe any significant evidence for a narrow spectral feature in the energy region around
1.4 TeV. Our measured all-electron flux, including statistical errors and a detailed breakdown
of the systematic errors, is tabulated in the Supplemental Material in order to allow more refined
spectral analyses based on our data.
