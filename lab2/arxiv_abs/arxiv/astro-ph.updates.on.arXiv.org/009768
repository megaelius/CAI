The morphology of spectral line polarization is the most valuable observable to investigate the
magnetic and dynamic solar atmosphere. However, in order to develop solar diagnosis, it is fundamental
to understand the different kinds of anomalous solar signals that have been routinely found in linear
and circular polarization (LP,CP). The goal of this paper has been to explain and characterize the
morphology of solar CP signals by understanding the combined effect of magnetic fields, velocity
gradients, and atomic orientation in general NLTE regime. To that aim, an analytical two-layer
model of the polarized radiative transfer equation is developed and used to solve the NLTE problem
with atomic polarization in a semi-parametric way. The formation of polarization is thus insightfully
described with certain precision without neither resorting in MHD models nor sacrifying key physical
ingredients. The potential of the model for reproducing solar anomalous CP is shown with detailed
calculations. The essential physical behavior of dichroism and atomic orientation is described,
introducing the concepts of dichroic inversion, neutral and reinforcing medium, critic intensity
spectrum, and critic source function. It is shown that the zero-crossings of the CP spectrum are
useful to classify its morphology and understand its formation. This led to identify and explain
the morphology of the seven most characteristics CP signals that a single (depth-resolved) scattering
layer can produce. Futhermore, it is found that a minimal number of two magnetic layers along the
LOS is required to fully explain anomalous solar CP signals, and that the morphology and polarity
of Stokes V depends on magnetic, radiative and atomic polarities. Some implications of these results
are presented through a preliminar modeling of anomalous CP signals in the Na I D and Fe I 1564.8 nm
lines.
