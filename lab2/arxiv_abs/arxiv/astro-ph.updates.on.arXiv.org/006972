During accretion, the young rocky planets are so hot that they become endowed with a magma ocean.
From that moment, the mantle convective thermal flux control the cooling of the planet and an atmosphere
is created by outgassing. This atmosphere will then play a key role during this cooling phase. Studying
this cooling phase in details is a necessary step to explain the great diversity of the observed telluric
planets and especially to assess the presence of surface liquid water. We used here a radiative-convective
1D atmospheric model (H2O, CO2) to study the impact of the Bond albedo on the evolution of magma ocean
planets. We derived from this model the thermal emission spectrum and the spectral reflectance
of these planets, from which we calculated their Bond albedos. Compared to Marcq et al. (2017), the
model now includes a new module to compute the Rayleigh scattering, and state of the art CO2 and H2O
gaseous opacities data in the visible and infrared spectral ranges. We show that the Bond albedo
of these planets depends on their surface temperature and results from a competition between Rayleigh
scattering from the gases and Mie scattering from the clouds. The colder the surface temperature
is, the thicker the clouds are, and the higher the Bond albedo is. We also evidence that the relative
abundances of CO2 and H2O in the atmosphere strongly impact the Bond albedo. The Bond albedo is higher
for atmospheres dominated by the CO2, better Rayleigh scatterer than H2O. Finally, we provide the
community with an empirical formula for the Bond albedo that could be useful for future studies of
magma ocean planets.
