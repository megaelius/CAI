Ultra-hot Jupiters have recently attracted interest from observers and theoreticians alike,
as they provide observationally accessible test cases. We apply a hierarchical modelling approach
as a virtual laboratory to study cloud formation and gas-phase chemistry. We utilise 97 vertical
1D profiles of a 3D GCM for HAT-P-7b to evaluate our kinetic cloud formation model consistently with
the local equilibrium gas-phase composition. The day/night temperature difference on HAT-P-7b
(~ 2500K) causes clouds to form on the nightside (dominated by H2/He) while the dayside (dominated
by H/He) retains cloud-free equatorial regions. The cloud particles vary in composition and size
throughout the vertical extension of the cloud, but also globally. TiO2[s]/Al2O3[s]/CaTiO3[s]-particles
of cm-sized radii occur in the higher dayside-latitudes, resulting in a dayside dominated by gas-phase
opacity. The opacity on the nightside, however, is dominated by 0.01 ... 0.1 mum particles made of
a material mix dominated by silicates. The gas pressure at which the atmosphere becomes optically
thick is ~1d-4 bar in cloudy regions, and ~0.1 bar in cloud-free regions. HAT-P-7b features strong
morning/evening terminator asymmetries, providing an example of patchy clouds and azimuthally-inhomogeneous
chemistry. The large temperature differences result in an increasing geometrical extension from
the night- to the dayside. The chemcial equilibrium H2O abundance at the terminator changes by <
1 dex with altitude and < 0.3 dex (a factor of 2) across the terminator for a given pressure, indicating
that H2O abundances derived from transmission spectra can be representative of the well-mixed
metallicity at P > 10 bar. We suggest the atmospheric C/O as an important tool to trace the presence
and location of clouds in exoplanet atmospheres. Phase curve variability of HAT-P-7b is unlikely
to be caused by dayside clouds.
