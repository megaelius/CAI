Context. The large quantity of high-quality asteroseismic data that obtained from space-based
photometric missions and the accuracy of the resulting frequencies motivate a careful consideration
of the accuracy of computed oscillation frequencies of stellar models, when applied as diagnostics
of the model properties. Aims. Based on models of red-giant stars that have been independently calculated
using different stellar evolution codes, we investigate the extent to which the differences in
the model calculation affect the model oscillation frequencies. Methods. For each of the models,
which cover four different masses and different evolution stages on the red-giant branch, we computed
full sets of low-degree oscillation frequencies using a single pulsation code and, from these frequencies,
typical asteroseismic diagnostics. In addition, we carried out preliminary analyses to relate
differences in the oscillation properties to the corresponding model differences. Results. In
general, the differences in asteroseismic properties between the different models greatly exceed
the observational precision of these properties, in particular for the nonradial modes whose mixed
acoustic and gravity-wave character makes them sensitive to the structure of the deep stellar interior.
In some cases, identifying these differences led to improvements in the final models presented
here and in Paper I; here we illustrate particular examples of this. Conclusions. Further improvements
in stellar modelling are required in order fully to utilise the observational accuracy to probe
intrinsic limitations in the modelling. However, our analysis of the frequency differences and
their relation to stellar internal properties provides a striking illustration of the potential
of the mixed modes of red-giant stars for the diagnostics of stellar interiors.
