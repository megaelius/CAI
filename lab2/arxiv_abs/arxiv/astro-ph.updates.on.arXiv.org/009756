Weak flaring events are frequent and ubiquitous in the solar corona. They derive their energy from
the local magnetic field and form a major source of local heating. These heating signatures make
them discernible in the EUV and X-ray bands. However, their radio emission arise from various plasma
instabilities that lead to coherent emission, making even a weak flare very bright in radio band.
Owing to the non-thermal emission mechanisms involved, the radio observations probe the physical
attributes unexplored by the high energy observations. However, the studies of radio emission
from these events require imaging with sub-second and sub-MHz resolutions owing to their high spectro-temporal
variability. Additionally, these events being quite frequent and ubiquitous, high fidelity and
dynamic range imaging is required to monitor individual events continuously. It is only now that
such observations are becoming possible. We present a spatially resolved study of a weak flaring
site using imaging observations at metrewave, EUV and X-ray bands, along with magnetogram observations.
We establish that X-ray, EUV and radio emissions share a common driver. We report the discovery of
$30\ s$ quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the radio light curve, which is accompanied by an
enhancement in the observed baseline radio flux density during the flare. The QPO timescale match
the local Alfv\'{e}n timescales across the typical braiding scales in the system. Our observations
suggest a scenario where magnetic strain systematically builds up over this timescale and then
dissipates via a cascade of weak reconnection events.
