We performed observations of the Sco-Cen F star HD 117214 aiming at a search for planetary companions
and the characterization of the debris disk structure. HD 117214 was observed with the SPHERE subsystems
IRDIS, IFS and ZIMPOL at optical and near-IR wavelengths using angular and polarimetric differential
imaging techniques. This provided the first images of scattered light from the debris disk with
a spatial resolution reaching 25 mas and an inner working angle $< 0.1''$. With the observations
with IRDIS and IFS we derive detection limits for substellar companions. The geometrical parameters
of the detected disk are constrained by fitting 3D models for the scattering of an optically thin
dust disk. Investigating the possible origin of the disk gap, we introduced putative planets therein
and modeled the planet-disk and planet-planet dynamical interactions. The obtained planetary
architectures are compared with the detection limit curves. The debris disk has an axisymmetric
ring structure with a radius of $0.42(\pm 0.01)''$ or $\sim45$ au and an inclination of $71(\pm 2.5)^\circ$
and exhibits a $0.4''$ ($\sim40$ au) wide inner cavity. From the polarimetric data, we derive a polarized
flux contrast for the disk of $(F_{\rm pol})_{\rm disk}/F_{\rm \ast}> (3.1 \pm 1.2)\cdot 10^{-4}$
in the RI band. The fractional scattered polarized flux of the disk is eight times smaller than the
fractional infrared flux excess. This ratio is similar to the one obtained for the debris disk HIP
79977 indicating that dust radiation properties are not very different between these two disks.
Inside the disk cavity we achieve the high sensitivity limits on planetary companions with a mass
down to $\sim 4 M_{\rm J}$ at projected radial separations between $0.2''$ and $0.4''$. We can exclude
the stellar companions at a radial separation larger than 75 mas from the star.
