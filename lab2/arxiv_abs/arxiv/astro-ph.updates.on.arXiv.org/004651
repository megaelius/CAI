We formulate a model of the conditional colour-magnitude distribution (CCMD) to describe the distribution
of galaxy luminosity and colour as a function of halo mass. It consists of two populations of different
colour distributions, dubbed pseudo-blue and pseudo-red, respectively, with each further separated
into central and satellite galaxies. We define a global parameterization of these four colour-magnitude
distributions and their dependence on halo mass, and we infer parameter values by simultaneously
fitting the space densities and auto-correlation functions of 79 galaxy samples from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey defined by fine bins in the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD). The model deprojects
the overall galaxy CMD, revealing its tomograph along the halo mass direction. The bimodality of
the colour distribution is driven by central galaxies at most luminosities, though at low luminosities
it is driven by the difference between blue centrals and red satellites. For central galaxies, the
two pseudo-colour components are distinct and orthogonal to each other in the CCMD: at fixed halo
mass, pseudo-blue galaxies have a narrow luminosity range and broad colour range, while pseudo-red
galaxies have a narrow colour range and broad luminosity range. For pseudo-blue centrals, luminosity
correlates tightly with halo mass, while for pseudo-red galaxies colour correlates more tightly
(redder galaxies in more massive haloes). The satellite fraction is higher for redder and for fainter
galaxies, with colour a stronger indicator than luminosity. We discuss the implications of the
results and further applications of the CCMD model.
