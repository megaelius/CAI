We report on the lowest-frequency detection to date of three bursts from FRB 180916.J0158+65, observed
at 328 MHz with the Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT). The SRT observed the periodic repeater FRB 180916.J0158+65
for five days from Feb. 20, 2020 to Feb. 24, 2020 during a time interval of active radio bursting, and
detected the three bursts during the first hour of observation; no more bursts were detected during
the remaining ~ 30 hours. Simultaneous SRT observations at 1548 MHz did not detect any bursts. Bursts
fluences are in the range 37 to 13 Jy ms. No relevant scattering is observed for these bursts. We also
present the results of the multi-wavelength campaign that we performed on FRB 180916.J0158+65,
during the ~ 5 days of the active window. Observations on different time spans were performed simultaneously
with the SRT observations with the Northern Cross at 408 MHz, with XMM-Newton, NICER, INTEGRAL,
AGILE and with the TNG and two optical telescopes in Asiago, which are equipped with fast photometers.
XMM-Newton obtained data simultaneously with the three bursts detected by the SRT and determined
a luminosity upper limit in the 0.3-10 keV energy range of $\sim10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for the burst
emission. AGILE obtained data simultaneously with the first burst and determined a fluence upper
limit in the MeV range for millisecond timescales of $ 10^{-8} \rm \, erg \, cm^{-2}$. Our results
sensibly constrain the broad-band emission from FRB 180916.J0158+65, and provide the best limits
so far for the electromagnetic response to the radio bursting of this remarkable source of fast radio
bursts.
