We use mock interferometric HI measurements and a conventional tilted-ring modelling procedure
to estimate circular velocity curves of dwarf galaxy discs from the APOSTLE suite of {\Lambda}CDM
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The modelling yields a large diversity of rotation
curves for an individual galaxy at fixed inclination, depending on the line-of-sight orientation.
The diversity is driven by non-circular motions in the gas; in particular, by strong bisymmetric
fluctuations in the azimuthal velocities that the tilted-ring model is ill-suited to account for
and that are difficult to detect in model residuals. Large misestimates of the circular velocity
arise when the kinematic major axis coincides with the extrema of the fluctuation pattern, in some
cases mimicking the presence of kiloparsec-scale density 'cores', when none are actually present.
The thickness of APOSTLE discs compounds this effect: more slowly-rotating extra-planar gas systematically
reduces the average line-of-sight speeds. The recovered rotation curves thus tend to underestimate
the true circular velocity of APOSTLE galaxies in the inner regions. Non-circular motions provide
an appealing explanation for the large apparent cores observed in galaxies such as DDO 47 and DDO
87, where the model residuals suggest that such motions might have affected estimates of the inner
circular velocities. Although residuals from tilted ring models in the simulations appear larger
than in observed galaxies, our results suggest that non-circular motions should be carefully taken
into account when considering the evidence for dark matter cores in individual galaxies.
