Context: Our understanding of the s-process nucleosynthesis in asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars is incomplete. AGB models predict, for example, large overabundances of lead (Pb) compared
to other s-process elements in metal-poor low-mass AGB stars. This is indeed observed in some extrinsically
enhanced metal-poor stars, but not in all. An extensive study of intrinsically s-process enriched
objects is essential for improving our knowledge of the AGB third dredge-up and associated s-process
nucleosynthesis. Aims: We compare the spectral abundance analysis of the SMC post-AGB star J004441.04-732136.4
with state-of-the-art AGB model predictions with a main focus on Pb. The low S/N in the Pb line region
made the result of our previous study inconclusive. We acquired additional data covering the region
of the strongest Pb line. Methods: By carefully complementing re-reduced previous data, with newly
acquired UVES optical spectra, we improve the S/N of the spectrum around the strongest Pb line. Therefore,
an upper limit for the Pb abundance is estimated from a merged weighted mean spectrum using synthetic
spectral modeling. We then compare the abundance results from the combined spectra to predictions
of tailored AGB evolutionary models from two independent evolution codes. In addition, we determine
upper limits for Pb abundances for three previously studied LMC post-AGB objects. Results: Although
theoretical predictions for J004441.04-732136.4 match the s-process distribution up to tungsten
(W), the predicted very high Pb abundance is clearly not detected. The three additional LMC post-AGB
stars show a similar lack of a very high Pb abundance. Conclusion: From our study, we conclude that
none of these low-mass, low-metallicity post-AGB stars of the LMC and SMC are strong Pb producers.
This conflicts with current theoretical predictions.
