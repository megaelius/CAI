The properties of galaxies are known to be affected by their environment, but although galaxies
in clusters and groups have been quite thoroughly investigated, little is known presently on galaxies
belonging to filaments of the cosmic web, and on the properties of the filaments themselves. We investigate
here the properties of the rich cluster MACSJ0717.5+3745 and its extended filament, by analyzing
the distribution and fractions of intra-cluster light (ICL) in the core of this cluster and by trying
to detect intra-filament light (IFL) in the filament. We analyze the galaxy luminosity function
(GLF) of the cluster core and of the filament. We also study the orientations of galaxies in the filament
to better constrain the filament properties. This work is based on Hubble Space Telescope archive
data, both from the Hubble Frontier Fields in the F435W, F606W, F814W, and F105W bands, and from a
mosaic of images in the F606W and F814W bands. The spatial distribution of the ICL is determined with
our new wavelet-based software, DAWIS. The GLFs are extracted in the F606W and F814W bands, with
a statistical subtraction of the background, and fit with Schechter functions. The galaxy orientations
in the filaments are estimated with SExtractor after correction for the Point Spread Function.
We detect a large amount of ICL in the cluster core, but no IFL in the cosmic filament. The fraction
of ICL in the core peaks in the F606W filter before decreasing with wavelength. Though quite noisy,
the GLFs in the filament are notably different from those of field galaxies, with a flatter faint
end slope and an excess of bright galaxies. We do not detect a significant alignment of the galaxies
in the filament region that was analyzed.
