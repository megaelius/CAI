Hot spots, or plasmoids, forming due to magnetic reconnection in current sheets, are conjectured
to power frequent X-ray and near-infrared flares from Sgr A*, the black hole in the center of our Galaxy.
It is unclear how, where, and when current sheets form in black-hole accretion disks. We perform
axisymmetric general-relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics simulations to model reconnection
and plasmoid formation in a range of accretion flows. Current sheets and plasmoids are ubiquitous
features which form regardless of the initial magnetic field in the disk, the magnetization in the
quasi-steady-state phase of accretion, and the spin of the black hole. Within 10 Schwarzschild
radii from the event horizon, we observe plasmoids forming, after which they can merge, grow to macroscopic
scales of the order of a few Schwarzschild radii, and are ultimately advected along the jet's sheath
or into the disk. Large plasmoids are energized to relativistic temperatures via reconnection
and contribute to the jet's limb-brightening. We find that only hot spots forming in magnetically
arrested disks can potentially explain the energetics of Sgr A* flares. The flare period is determined
by the reconnection rate, which we find to be between 0.01c and 0.03c in all cases, consistent with
studies of reconnection in isolated Harris-type current sheets. We quantify magnetic dissipation
and non-ideal electric fields which can efficiently inject non-thermal particles. We show that
explicit resistivity allows for converged numerical solutions, such that the electromagnetic
energy evolution and dissipation become independent of the grid scale for the extreme resolutions
considered here.
