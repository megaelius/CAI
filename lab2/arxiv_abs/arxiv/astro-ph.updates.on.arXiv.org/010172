The abundance of highly siderophile elements (HSEs) inferred for Mars' mantle from martian meteorites
implies a Late Veneer (LV) mass addition of ~0.8 wt% with broadly chondritic composition. Late accretion
to Mars by a differentiated Ceres-sized (~1000 km diameter) object can account for part of the requisite
LV mass, and geochronological constraints suggests that this must have occurred no later than ca.
4480 Ma. Here, we analyze the outcome of the hypothetical LV giant impact to Mars with smoothed particle
hydrodynamics simulations together with analytical theory. Results show that, in general about
50% of the impactor's metallic core shatters into ~10m fragments that subsequently fragment into
sub-mm metallic hail at re-accretion. This returns a promising delivery of HSEs into martian mantle
compared to either a head-on and hit-and-run collision; in both cases,<10% of impactor's core materials
are fragmented and finally embedded in the martian mantle. Isotopic evidence from martian meteorites,
and interpretations from atmospheric mapping data show that a global surface water reservoir could
be present during the early Noachian (before ca. 4100 Ma). The millimeter-sized metal hail could
thus react with a martian hydrosphere to generate ~3 bars of H2, which is adequate to act as a greenhouse
and keep early Mars warm. Yet, we also find that this atmosphere is transient. It typically survives
shorter than 3 Myr based on the expected extreme ultraviolet (EUV) flux of the early Sun; if the Sun
was a slow rotator an accordingly weaker EUV flux could extend this lifetime to >10 Myr. A dense pre-Noachian
CO2 atmosphere should lower the escape efficiency of hydrogen by IR emission. A more detailed hydrodynamic
atmospheric model of this early hydrogen atmosphere is warranted to examine its effect on pre-Noachian
Mars.
