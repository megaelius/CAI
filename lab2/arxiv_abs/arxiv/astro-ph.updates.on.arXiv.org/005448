Upcoming photometric lensing surveys will considerably tighten constraints on the neutrino mass
and the dark energy equation of state. Nevertheless it remains an open question of how to optimally
extract the information and how well the matter power spectrum must be known to obtain unbiased cosmological
parameter estimates. By performing a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we quantify the sensitivity
of 3D cosmic shear and tomography with different binning strategies to different regions of the
lensing kernel and matter power spectrum, and hence the background geometry and growth of structure
in the Universe. We find that a large number of equally spaced tomographic bins in redshift can extract
nearly all the cosmological information without the additional computational expense of 3D cosmic
shear. Meanwhile a large fraction of the information comes from small poorly understood scales
in the matter power spectrum, that can lead to biases on measurements of cosmological parameters.
In light of this, we define and compute a cosmology-independent measure of the bias due to imperfect
knowledge of the power spectrum. For a Euclid-like survey, we find that the power spectrum must be
known to an accuracy of less than 1% on scales with k = 7 h /Mpc This requirement is not absolute since
the bias depends on the magnitude of modelling errors, where they occur in k-z space, and the correlation
between them, all of which are specific to any particular model. We therefore compute the bias in
several of the most likely modelling scenarios and introduce a general formalism and public code,
RequiSim, to compute the expected bias from any non-linear model.
