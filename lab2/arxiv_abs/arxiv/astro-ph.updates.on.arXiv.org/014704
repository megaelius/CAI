The radius distribution of small, close-in exoplanets has recently been shown to be bimodal. The
photoevaporation model predicted this bimodality. In the photoevaporation scenario, some planets
are completely stripped of their primordial H/He atmospheres, whereas others retain them. Comparisons
between the photoevaporation model and observed planetary populations have the power to unveil
details of the planet population inaccessible by standard observations, such as the core mass distribution
and core composition. In this work, we present a hierarchical inference analysis on the distribution
of close-in exoplanets using forward-models of photoevaporation evolution. We use this model
to constrain the planetary distributions for core composition, core mass and initial atmospheric
mass fraction. We find that the core-mass distribution is peaked, with a mean-mass of $\sim 6$ M$_\oplus$.
The bulk core-composition is consistent with a rock/iron mixture that is ice-poor and "Earth-like";
the spread in core-composition is found to be narrow ($\lesssim 16\%$ variation in iron-mass fraction
at the 2$\sigma$ level) and consistent zero. This result favours core formation in a water/ice poor
environment. We find the majority of planets accreted a H/He envelope with a typical mass fraction
of $\sim 4\%$; only a small fraction did not accrete large amounts of H/He and were "born-rocky".
We find four-times as many super-Earths were formed through photoevaporation, as formed without
a large H/He atmosphere. Finally, we find core-accretion theory over-predicts the amount of H/He
cores would have accreted by a factor of $\sim 5$, pointing to additional mass-loss mechanisms (e.g.
"boil-off") or modifications to core-accretion theory.
