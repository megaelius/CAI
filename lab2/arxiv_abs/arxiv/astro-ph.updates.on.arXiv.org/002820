HAT-P-20b is a giant exoplanet that orbits a metal-rich star. The planet itself has a high total density,
suggesting that it may also have a high metallicity in its atmosphere. We analyze two eclipses of
the planet in each of the 3.6- and 4.5 micron bands of Warm Spitzer. These data exhibit intra-pixel
detector sensitivity fluctuations that were resistant to traditional decorrelation methods.
We have developed a simple, powerful, and radically different method to correct the intra-pixel
effect for Warm Spitzer data, which we call pixel-level decorrelation (PLD). PLD corrects the intra-pixel
effect very effectively, but without explicitly using - or even measuring - the fluctuations in
the apparent position of the stellar image. We illustrate and validate PLD using synthetic and real
data, and comparing the results to previous analyses. PLD can significantly reduce or eliminate
red noise in Spitzer secondary eclipse photometry, even for eclipses that have proven to be intractable
using other methods. Our successful PLD analysis of four HAT-P-20b eclipses shows a best-fit blackbody
temperature of 1134 +/-29K, indicating inefficient longitudinal transfer of heat, but lacking
evidence for strong molecular absorption. We find sufficient evidence for variability in the 4.5
micron band that the eclipses should be monitored at that wavelength by Spitzer, and this planet
should be a high priority for JWST spectroscopy. All four eclipses occur about 35 minutes after orbital
phase 0.5, indicating a slightly eccentric orbit. A joint fit of the eclipse and transit times with
extant RV data yields e(cos{omega}) = 0.01352 (+0.00054, -0.00057), and establishes the small
eccentricity of the orbit to high statistical confidence. Given the existence of a bound stellar
companion, HAT-P-20b is another excellent candidate for orbital evolution via Kozai migration
or other three-body mechanism.
