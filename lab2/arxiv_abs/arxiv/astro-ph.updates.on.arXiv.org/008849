We modeled the transit signatures in the Lya line of a putative Earth-sized planet orbiting in the
HZ of the M dwarf GJ436. We estimated the transit depth in the Lya line for an exo-Earth with three types
of atmospheres: a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, a nitrogen-dominated atmosphere, and a nitrogen-dominated
atmosphere with an amount of hydrogen equal to that of the Earth. We calculated the in-transit absorption
they would produce in the Lya line. We applied it to the out-of-transit Lya observations of GJ 436
obtained by the HST and compared the calculated in-transit absorption with observational uncertainties
to determine if it would be detectable. To validate the model, we also used our method to simulate
the deep absorption signature observed during the transit of GJ 436b and showed that our model is
capable of reproducing the observations. We used a DSMC code to model the planetary exospheres.
The code includes several species and traces neutral particles and ions. At the lower boundary of
the DSMC model we assumed an atmosphere density, temperature, and velocity obtained with a hydrodynamic
model for the lower atmosphere. We showed that for a small rocky Earth-like planet orbiting in the
HZ of GJ436 only the hydrogen-dominated atmosphere is marginally detectable with the STIS/HST.
Neither a pure nitrogen atmosphere nor a nitrogen-dominated atmosphere with an Earth-like hydrogen
concentration in the upper atmosphere are detectable. We also showed that the Lya observations
of GJ436b can be reproduced reasonably well assuming a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, both in
the blue and red wings of the Lya line, which indicates that warm Neptune-like planets are a suitable
target for Lya observations. Terrestrial planets can be observed in the Lya line if they orbit very
nearby stars, or if several observational visits are available.
