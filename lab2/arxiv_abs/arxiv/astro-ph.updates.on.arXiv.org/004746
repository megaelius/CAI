Dissipative dark matter, where dark matter particle properties closely resemble familiar baryonic
matter, is considered. Mirror dark matter, which arises from an isomorphic hidden sector, is a specific
and theoretically constrained scenario. Other possibilities include models with more generic
hidden sectors that contain massless dark photons (unbroken $U(1)$ gauge interactions). Such
dark matter not only features dissipative cooling processes, but is also assumed to have nontrivial
heating sourced by ordinary supernovae (facilitated by the kinetic mixing interaction). The dynamics
of dissipative dark matter halos around rotationally supported galaxies, influenced by heating
as well as cooling processes, can be modelled by fluid equations. For a sufficiently isolated galaxy
with stable star formation rate, the dissipative dark matter halos are expected to evolve to a steady
state configuration which is in hydrostatic equilibrium and where heating and cooling rates locally
balance. Here, we take into account the major cooling and heating processes, and numerically solve
for the steady state solution under the assumptions of spherical symmetry, negligible dark magnetic
fields, and that supernova sourced energy is transported to the halo via dark radiation. For the
parameters considered, and assumptions made, we were unable to find a physically realistic solution
for the constrained case of mirror dark matter halos. Halo cooling generally exceeds heating at
realistic halo mass densities. This problem can be rectified in more generic dissipative dark matter
models, and we discuss a specific example in some detail.
