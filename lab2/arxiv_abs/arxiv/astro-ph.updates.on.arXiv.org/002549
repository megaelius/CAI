We performed a systematic X-ray study of eight nearby gamma-ray bright radio galaxies with Suzaku
for understanding the origin of their X-ray emissions. The Suzaku spectra for five of those have
been presented previously, while the remaining three (M87, PKS0625-354, and 3C78) are presented
here for the first time. Based on the Fe-K line strength, X-ray variability, and X-ray power-law
photon indices, and using additional information on the [O III] line emission, we argue for a jet
origin of the observed X-ray emission in these three sources. We also analyzed five years of Fermi
Large Area Telescope (LAT) GeV gamma-ray data on PKS0625-354 and 3C78 to understand these sources
within the blazar picture. We found significant gamma-ray variability in the former object. Overall,
we note that the Suzaku spectra for both PKS0625-354 and 3C78 are rather soft, while the LAT spectra
are unusually hard when compared with other gamma-ray detected low-power (FR I) radio galaxies.
We demonstrate that the constructed broad-band spectral energy distributions of PKS0625-354
and 3C78 are well described by a one-zone synchrotron/synchrotron self-Compton model. The results
of the modeling indicate lower bulk Lorentz factors compared to those typically found in other BL
Lac objects, but consistent with the values inferred from modeling other LAT-detected FR\,I radio
galaxies. Interestingly, the modeling also implies very high peak ($\sim 10^{16}$ Hz) synchrotron
frequencies in the two analyzed sources, contrary to previously-suggested scenarios for FR I/BL
Lac unification. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context of the FR I/BL Lac unification
schemes.
