Large-scale structure of Universe includes galaxy clusters connected by filaments. Voids occupy
the rest of cosmic volume. The search of any dependencities in filament structure can give answer
to more general questions about origin of structures in the Universe. This becomes possible because,
according to current picture of Universe, one could simulate the evolution of Universe until its
very beginning or vice versa. According to current cosmological hydrodynamical theories a number
of computer simulations of LSS were performed to describe its properties. In this work we consider
alternative variant of simulating the distribution of matter that is very similar to real. We simulated
two-dimensional galaxy distribution on the sky using random distributions of clusters and single
galaxies. The main assumption was that matter clusterised to initial density fluctuations with
uniform distribution. According to Zeldovich theory, low-dimensional anisotropies should increase,
that corresponds to appearance of filaments in 2D case. Thus we generated a net of filaments between
clusters with certain length limits. Real galaxy distribution was simulated by random changing
galaxy positions in filaments and clusters. We generated radial distributions of galaxies in clusters
taking into account the surrounding and add uniform distribution of isolated galaxies in voids.
Our model has been coordinated with SDSS galaxy distribution with using two-point angular correlation
function. Parameters of random distributions were found for the case of equality of correlation
function slope for the model and for observational data.
