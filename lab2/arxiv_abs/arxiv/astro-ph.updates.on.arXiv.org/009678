Accurate determinations of atmospheric parameters (effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$, surface
gravity log $g$ and metallicity [Fe/H]) and distances for large complete samples are of vital importance
for various Galactic studies. We have developed a photometric method to select red giant stars and
estimate their atmospheric parameters from the photometric colors provided by the SkyMapper Southern
Survey (SMSS) data release (DR) 1.1, using stars in common with the LAMOST Galactic spectroscopic
surveys as a training set. Distances are estimated with two different approaches: one based on the
Gaia DR2 parallaxes for nearby ($d \leq 4.5$ kpc) bright stars and another based on the absolute magnitudes
predicted by intrinsic color $(g-i)_0$ and photometric metallicity [Fe/H] for distant ($d > 4.5$
kpc) faint stars. Various tests show that our method is capable of delivering atmospheric parameters
with a precision of $\sim$80 K for $T_{\rm eff}$, $\sim$0.18 dex for [Fe/H] and $\sim$0.35 dex for
log $g$, but with a significant systematic error at log $g \sim$ 2.3. For distances delivered from
$(g-i)_0$ and photometric [Fe/H], our test with the member stars of globular clusters show a median
uncertainty of 16 per cent with a negligible zero-point offset. Using this method, atmospheric
parameters and distances of nearly one million red giant stars are derived from SMSS DR1.1. Proper
motion measurements from Gaia DR2 are available for almost all of the red giant stars, and radial
velocity measurements from several large spectroscopic surveys are available for 44 per cent of
these. This sample will be accessible online at https://yanghuang0.wixsite.com/yangh/research
