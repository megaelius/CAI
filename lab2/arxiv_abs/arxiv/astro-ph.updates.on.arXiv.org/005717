According to LCDM theory, hierarchical evolution should occur on all mass scales, implying that
satellites of the Milky Way also once had companions. The recent discovery of several ultra-faint
dwarf galaxy candidates in close proximity to the Magellanic Clouds provides a unique opportunity
to test this theory. Specifically, proper motions provide a stringent test, because material that
is associated with the Large Magellanic Cloud prior to infall should retain its direction of orbital
angular momentum. We present proper motion measurements for 13 of the 32 newly discovered dwarf
galaxy candidates using Gaia data release 2. All 13 also have radial velocity measurements. We compare
the measured 3D velocities of these dwarfs to those expected at the corresponding distance and location
for the debris of an LMC analog in a numerical simulation. We conclude that 4 of these galaxies (Hor1,
Car2, Car3 and Hyd1) have come in with the Magellanic Cloud system, constituting the first confirmation
of the type of satellite infall predicted by LCDM. Ret2, Tuc2 and Gru1 have some velocity components
that are not consistent within 3 sigma of our predictions and are therefore less favorable. Hyd2
and Dra2 could be associated with the LMC and merit further attention. We rule out Tuc3, Cra2, Tri2
and Aqu2 as potential members. Of the dwarfs without measured PMs, 6 of them are deemed unlikely on
the basis of their positions and distances alone which put them too far from the orbital plane expected
for LMC debris (Eri2, Ind2, Cet2, Tri2, Cet3 and Vir1). For the remaining sample, we use the simulation
to predict proper motions and radial velocities, finding that Phx2 has an overdensity of stars in
DR2 consistent with this PM prediction. If its radial velocity is confirmed at $\sim -15$ km s$^{-1},
it is also likely a member.
