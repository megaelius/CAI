Investigating in the laboratory the process of matter accretion onto forming stars through scaled
experiments is important in order to better understand star and planetary systems formation and
evolution. Such experiments can indeed complement observations by providing access to the processes
with spatial and temporal resolution. A first step has been made in [G. Revet et al., Science Advances
3, e1700982 (2017), arXiv:1708.02528]. in allowing such investigations. It revealed the existence
of a two components stream: a hot shell surrounding a cooler inner stream. The shell was formed by
matter laterally ejected upon impact and refocused by the local magnetic field. That laboratory
investigation was limited tonormal incidence impacts. However, in young stellar objects, complex
structure of magnetic fields causes variability of the incidentangles of the accretion columns.
This led us to undertake an investigation, using laboratory plasmas, of the consequence of having
a slanted accretion impacting a young star. Here we use high power laser interactions and strong
magnetic field generation in the laboratory, complemented by numerical simulations, to study
the asymmetry induced upon accretion structures when columns of matter impact the surface of young
stars with an oblique angle. Compared to the scenario where matter accretes normal to the star surface,
we observe strongly asymmetric plasma structure, strong lateral ejecta of matter, poor confinement
of the accreted material and reduced heating compared to the normal incidence case. Thus, slanted
accretion is a configuration that seems to be capable of inducing perturbations of the chromosphere
and hence possibly influence the level of activity of the corona.
