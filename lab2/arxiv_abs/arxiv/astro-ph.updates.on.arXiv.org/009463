The electromagnetic (EM) signal of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger depends sensitively on the
total binary mass, $M_{\rm tot}$, relative to various threshold masses set by the equation of state
(EOS) of the neutron star (NS), particularly those which determine its maximum non-rotating mass,
$M_{\rm TOV}$, and characteristic radius, $R_{1.6}$. EM observations of a BNS merger detected
through its gravitational wave (GW) emission, which are of sufficient quality to ascertain the
identity of the merger remnant, can therefore constrain the values of $M_{\rm TOV}$ and $R_{1.6}$,
given the tight connection between $M_{\rm tot}$ and the well-measured chirp mass. We elucidate
the present and future landscape of EOS constraints from BNS mergers, introducing the ``Multi-Messenger
Matrix", a mapping between GW and EM measurables that defines the ranges of event chirp masses which
provide the most leverage on constraining the EOS, and which will become increasingly predictive
as the number of joint detections grows and the EOS constraints tighten. By simulating a population
of BNS mergers drawn from the Galactic double NS mass distribution we show that $\sim 10$ joint detections
can constrain $M_{\rm TOV}$ and $R_{1.6}$ to several percent level where systematic uncertainties
may become significant. Current EOS constraints result in the prediction that most mergers will
produce supramassive or hypermassive remnants, a smaller minority (possibly zero) will undergo
prompt-collapse, while at most only a few percent of events will form indefinitely stable NSs. In
support of the envisioned program, we strongly advocate in favor of LIGO/Virgo releasing chirp
mass estimates as early as possible to the scientific community, ideally already with the initial
triggers, enabling observational resources to be allocated in the most efficient way to maximize
the scientific gain from multi-messenger discoveries.
