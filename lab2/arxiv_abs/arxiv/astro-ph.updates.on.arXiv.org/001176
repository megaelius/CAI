We investigate the spatially-resolved star formation relation using a galactic disk formed in
a comprehensive high-resolution (3.8 pc) simulation. Our new implementation of stellar feedback
includes ionizing radiation as well as supernova explosions, and we handle ionizing radiation
by solving the radiative transfer equation rather than by a subgrid model. Photoheating by stellar
radiation stabilizes gas against Jeans fragmentation, reducing the star formation rate. Because
we have self-consistently calculated the location of ionized gas, we are able to make spatially-resolved
mock observations of star formation tracers, such as H-alpha emission. We can also observe how stellar
feedback manifests itself in the correlation between ionized and molecular gas. Applying our techniques
to the disk in a galactic halo of 2.3e11 Msun, we find that the correlation between star formation
rate density (estimated from mock H-alpha emission) and molecular hydrogen density shows large
scatter, especially at high resolutions of <~ 75 pc that are comparable to the size of giant molecular
clouds (GMCs). This is because an aperture of GMC size captures only particular stages of GMC evolution,
and because H-alpha traces hot gas around star-forming regions and is displaced from the molecular
hydrogen peaks themselves. By examining the evolving environment around star clusters, we speculate
that the breakdown of the traditional star formation laws of the Kennicutt-Schmidt type at small
scales is further aided by a combination of stars drifting from their birthplaces, and molecular
clouds being dispersed via stellar feedback.
