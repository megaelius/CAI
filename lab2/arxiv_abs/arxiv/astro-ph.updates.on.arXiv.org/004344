The well-established notion of a "common population" of the accelerated electrons simultaneously
producing the hard X-ray (HXR) and the microwave (MW) emission during the flare impulsive phase
has been challenged by some studies reporting the discrepancies between the HXR-inferred and the
MW-inferred electron energy spectra. The traditional methods of their spectral inversion have
some problems that can be mainly attributed to the unrealistic and the oversimplified treatment
of the flare emission. To properly address this problem, we use a Non-linear Force Free Field (NLFFF)
model extrapolated from an observed photospheric magnetogram as input to the three-dimensional,
multi-wavelength modeling platform GX Simulator, and create a unified electron population model
that can simultaneously reproduce the observed HXR and MW observations. We model the end of the impulsive
phase of the 2015-06-22 M6.5 flare, and constrain the modeled electron spatial and energy parameters
using observations made by the highest-resolving instruments currently available in two wavelengths,
the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) for HXR and the Expanded Owens
Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) for MW. Our results suggest that the HXR-emitting electron population
model fits the standard flare model with a broken power-law spectrum (E_break ~ 200 keV) that simultaneously
produces the HXR footpoint emission and the MW high frequency emission. The model also includes
an "HXR invisible" population of nonthermal electrons that are trapped in a large volume of magnetic
field above the HXR-emitting loops, which is observable by its gyrosynchrotron (GS) radiation
emitting mainly in MW low frequency range.
