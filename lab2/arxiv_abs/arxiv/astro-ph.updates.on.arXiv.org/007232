Abridged: Getting a better understanding of the evolution and nucleosynthetic yields of the most
metal-poor stars (appr. Z<=10^-5) is critical because they are part of the big picture of the history
of the primitive Universe. Yet many of the remaining unknowns of stellar evolution lie in the birth,
life, and death of these objects. We review stellar evolution of intermediate-mass (IMS) Z<=10-5
models existing in the literature, with a focus on the problem of their final fates. The depth and
efficiency of mixing episodes are critical to determine the mass limits for the formation of electron-capture
supernovae, but our knowledge of these phenomena is not complete because they are strongly affected
by the choice of input physics. We also consider the alternative SNI1/2 channel to form SNe out of
the most metal-poor IMS. In this case, it is critical to understand the thermally-pulsing AGB evolution
until the late stages. Efficient second dredge-up and, later, third dredge-up episodes could be
able to pollute stellar envelopes enough for the stars to undergo thermal pulses in a way very similar
to that of higher initial Z objects. Inefficient 2nd and/or 3rd dredge-up may leave an almost pristine
envelope, unable to sustain strong stellar winds. This may allow the H-exhausted core to grow to
M_Ch before the envelope is lost, and thus let the star explode as a SNI1/2. After reviewing the information
available on these two possible channels for the formation of SNe, we discuss existing nucleosynthetic
yields of stars of metallicity Z<=10^-5, and present an example of nucleosynthetic calculations
for a thermally-pulsing Super-AGB star of Z=10^-5. We compare theoretical predictions with observations
of the lowest [Fe/H] objects detected. The review closes by discussing current open questions as
well as possible fruitful avenues for future research.
