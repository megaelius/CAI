The star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies contain imprints of the physical processes responsible
for regulating star formation during galaxy growth and quenching. We improve the Dense Basis SFH
reconstruction method of Iyer & Gawiser (2017), introducing a nonparametric description of the
SFH based on the lookback times at which a galaxy assembles certain quantiles of its stellar mass.
The method uses Gaussian Processes to create smooth SFHs that are independent of any functional
form, with a flexible number of parameters that is adjusted to extract the maximum possible amount
of SFH information from the SEDs being fit. We apply the method to reconstruct the SFHs of 48,791 galaxies
with $H<25$ at $0.5 < z < 3.0$ across the five CANDELS fields. Using these SFHs, we study the evolution
of galaxies as they grow more massive over cosmic time. We quantify the fraction of galaxies that
show multiple major episodes of star formation, finding that the median time between two peaks of
star formation is $\sim 0.42_{-0.10}^{+0.15}t_{univ}$ Gyr, where $t_{univ}$ is the age of the
universe at a given redshift and remains roughly constant with stellar mass. Correlating SFHs with
morphology, we find that studying the median SFHs of galaxies at $0.5<z<1.0$ at the same mass ($10^{10}<
M_* < 10^{10.5}M_\odot$) allows us to compare the timescales on which the SFHs decline for different
morphological classifications, ranging from $0.60^{-0.54}_{+1.54}$ Gyr for galaxies with spiral
arms to $2.50^{-1.50}_{+2.25}$ Gyr for spheroids. The Gaussian Process-based SFH description
provides a general approach to reconstruct smooth, nonparametric SFH posteriors for galaxies
with a flexible number of parameters that can be incorporated into Bayesian SED fitting codes to
minimize the bias in estimating physical parameters due to SFH parametrization.
