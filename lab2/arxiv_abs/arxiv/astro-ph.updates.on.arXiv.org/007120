We present multiwavelength observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) iPTF15af, discovered
by the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) survey at redshift $z=0.07897$. The optical
and ultraviolet (UV) light curves of the transient show a slow decay over five months, in agreement
with previous optically discovered TDEs. It also has a comparable black-body peak luminosity of
$L_{\rm{peak}} \approx 1.2 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The inferred temperature from the optical
and UV data shows a constant value of (3$-$5) $\times 10^4$ K. The transient is not detected in X-rays
up to $L_X < 3 \times 10^{42}$erg s$^{-1}$ within the first five months after discovery. The optical
spectra exhibit two distinct broad emission lines in the He II region, and at later times also H$\alpha$
emission. Additionally, emission from [N III] and [O III] is detected, likely produced by the Bowen
fluorescence effect. UV spectra reveal broad emission and absorption lines associated with high-ionization
states of N V, C IV, Si IV, and possibly P V. These features, analogous to those of broad absorption
line quasars (BAL QSOs), require an absorber with column densities $N_{\rm{H}} > 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$.
This optically thick gas would also explain the nondetection in soft X-rays. The profile of the absorption
lines with the highest column density material at the largest velocity is opposite that of BAL QSOs.
We suggest that radiation pressure generated by the TDE flare at early times could have provided
the initial acceleration mechanism for this gas. Spectral line monitoring of future TDEs could
test this proposal.
