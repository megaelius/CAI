In this work we investigate the environmental dependence of the intrinsic ellipticity correlations
in cosmic shear surveys. We use the quadratic and linear alignment model to describe the contributions
by spiral and elliptical galaxies, respectively. The density field is in both cases described by
a Gaussian random field and ellipticity correlation functions that are conditional on the environment
of the galaxies are constructed by sampling random values for the tidal tensor and inertial tensor.
The covariance of the Gaussian random process from which the tensor entries are drawn is decomposed
by means of a spherical Fourier-Bessel transformation of the density field. The dependence on environment
is modelled by the number of positive eigenvalues of the tidal tensor, which allows a differentiation
between voids, sheets, filaments and superclusters. We find that elliptical galaxies align strongest
in elongated structures such as sheets and filaments with an amplitude almost an order of magnitude
higher compared to the alignment in clusters or voids. In contrast to this, spiral galaxies align
equally strong in all environments. Cross-alignments between different environments are smaller
than the respective auto-correlations subject to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality which is an effective
bound on their amplitude. Furthermore, we find misalignment between inertial and tidal tensor
to be stronger in anisotropic regions compared to clusters or voids. While the imprint of weak lensing
on galaxy ellipticities is agnostic about the environment, using environment information can
help to distinguish between lensing and the intrinsic alignment signal.
