We aim at assessing the importance of tidal evolution and its interplay with magnetic braking in
the population of hot-Jupiter planetary systems. By minimizing the total mechanical energy of
a given system under the constraint of stellar angular momentum loss, we rigorously find the conditions
for the existence of dynamical equilibrium states. We estimate their duration, in particular when
the wind torque spinning down the star is almost compensated by the tidal torque spinning it up. We
introduce dimensionless variables to characterize the tidal evolution of observed hot Jupiter
systems and discuss their spin and orbital states using generalized Darwin diagrams based on our
new approach. We show that their orbital properties are related to the effective temperature of
their host stars. The long-term evolution of planets orbiting F- and G-type stars is significantly
different owing to the combined effect of magnetic braking and tidal dissipation. The existence
of a quasi-stationary state, in the case of short-period planets, can significantly delay their
tidal evolution that would otherwise bring the planet to fall into its host star. Most of the planets
known to orbit F-type stars are presently found to be near this stationary state, probably in a configuration
not too far from that they had when their host star settled on the zero-age main sequence. Estimates
of the engulfment timescale based on the conservation of the total angular momentum of a star-planet
system must be revised and angular momentum loss has to be taken into account when constraining tidal
evolution in close planetary systems. Considering the importance of angular momentum loss in the
early stages of stellar evolution, our results indicate that it has to be taken into account also
to properly test the migration scenarios of planetary system formation.
