Studying the formation and evolution of galaxies at the earliest cosmic times, and their role in
reionization, requires the deepest imaging possible. Ultra-deep surveys like the HUDF and HFF
have pushed to mag \mAB$\,\sim\,$30, revealing galaxies at the faint end of the LF to $z$$\,\sim\,$9$\,-\,$11
and constraining their role in reionization. However, a key limitation of these fields is their
size, only a few arcminutes (less than a Mpc at these redshifts), too small to probe large-scale environments
or clustering properties of these galaxies, crucial for advancing our understanding of reionization.
Achieving HUDF-quality depth over areas $\sim$100 times larger becomes possible with a mission
like the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), a 2.4-m telescope with similar optical
properties to HST, with a field of view of $\sim$1000 arcmin$^2$, $\sim$100$\times$ the area of
the HST/ACS HUDF. This whitepaper motivates an Ultra-Deep Field survey with WFIRST, covering $\sim$100$\,-\,$300$\times$
the area of the HUDF, or up to $\sim$1 deg$^2$, to \mAB$\,\sim\,$30, potentially revealing thousands
of galaxies and AGN at the faint end of the LF, at or beyond $z$\,$\sim$\,9$\,-\,$10 in the epoch of
reionization, and tracing their LSS environments, dramatically increasing the discovery potential
at these redshifts. (Note: This paper is a slightly expanded version of one that was submitted as
input to the Astro2020 Decadal Survey, the primary difference being the inclusion of an Appendix
here (which exceeded the Astro2020 page limits), describing how the science drivers for a WFIRST
Ultra Deep Field might map into a notional observing pogram, including the filters used and exposure
times needed to achieve these depths.)
