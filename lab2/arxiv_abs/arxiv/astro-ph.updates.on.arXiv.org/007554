Several B-type main-sequence stars show chemical peculiarities. A particularly striking class
are the $^3$He stars, which exhibit a remarkable enrichment of $^3$He with respect to $^4$He. This
isotopic anomaly has also been found in blue horizontal branch (BHB) and subdwarf B (sdB) stars,
which are helium-core burning stars of the extreme horizontal branch. Using a hybrid local/non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE/NLTE) approach for B-type stars, we analyzed high-quality spectra
of two known $^3$He BHBs and nine known $^3$He sdBs to determine their isotopic helium abundances
and $^4$He/$^3$He abundance ratios. We redetermined their atmospheric parameters and analyzed
selected neutral helium lines, including $\lambda$4922 $\mathring{A}$ and $\lambda$6678 $\mathring{A}$,
which are very sensitive to $^4$He/$^3$He. Most of the $^3$He sdBs cluster in a narrow temperature
strip between 26000 K and 30000 K and are helium deficient in accordance with previous LTE analyses.
BD+48$^\circ$ 2721 is reclassified as a BHB star because of its low temperature ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}=$
20700 K). Whereas $^4$He is almost absent ($^4$He/$^3$He$<$ 0.25) in most of the known $^3$He stars,
other sample stars show abundance ratios up to $^4$He/$^3$He$=$2.51. A search for $^3$He stars
in the ESO SPY survey led to the discovery of two new $^3$He sdB stars (HE 0929-0424 and HE 1047-0436).
The observed helium line profiles of all BHBs and of three sdBs are not matched by chemically homogeneous
atmospheres, but hint at vertical helium stratification. This phenomenon has been seen in other
peculiar B-type stars, but is found for the first time for sdBs. We estimate helium to increase from
the outer to the inner atmosphere by factors ranging from 1.4 (SB 290) up to 8.0 (BD+48$^\circ$ 2721).
