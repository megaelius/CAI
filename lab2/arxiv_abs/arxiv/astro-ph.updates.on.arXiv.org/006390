We investigated the infrared (IR) dust emission from PN IC\,418, using a detailed model controlled
by a previous determination of the stellar properties and the characteristics of the photoionized
nebula, keeping as free parameters the dust types, amounts and distributions relative to the distance
of the central star. The model includes the ionized region and the neutral region beyond the recombination
front (Photodissociation region, or PDR), where the [OI] and [CII] IR lines are formed. We succeeded
in reproducing the observed infrared emission from 2 to 200~\mm. The global energy budget is fitted
by summing up contributions from big grains of amorphous carbon located in the neutral region and
small graphite grains located in the ionized region (closer to the central star). Two emission features
seen at 11.5 and 30~\mm are also reproduced by assuming them to be due to silicon carbide (SiC) and
magnesium and iron sulfides (Mg$_x$Fe$_{1-x}$S), respectively. For this, we needed to consider
ellipsoidal shapes for the grains to reproduce the wavelength distribution of the features. Some
elements are depleted in the gaseous phase: Mg, Si, and S have sub-solar abundances (-0.5 dex below
solar by mass), while the abundance of C+N+O+Ne by mass is close to solar. Adding the abundances of
the elements present in the dusty and gaseous forms leads to values closer to but not higher than solar,
confirming that the identification of the feature carriers is plausible. Iron is strongly depleted
(3 dex below solar) and the small amount present in dust in our model is far from being enough to recover
the solar value. A remaining feature is found as a residue of the fitting process, between 12 and 25~\mm,
for which we do not have identification.
