Small planets on close-in orbits tend to exhibit envelope mass fractions of either effectively
zero or up to a few percent depending on their size and orbital period. Models of thermally-driven
atmospheric mass loss and of terrestrial planet formation in a gas-poor environment make distinct
predictions regarding the location of this rocky/non-rocky transition in period-radius space.
Here we present the confirmation of TOI-1235 b ($P=3.44$ days, $r_p=1.738^{+0.087}_{-0.076}$
R$_{\oplus}$), a planet whose size and period are intermediate between the competing model predictions
thus making the system an important test case for emergence models of the rocky/non-rocky transition
around early M dwarfs ($R_s=0.630\pm 0.015$ R$_{\odot}$, $M_s=0.640\pm 0.016$ M$_{\odot}$).
We confirm the TESS planet discovery using reconnaissance spectroscopy, ground-based photometry,
high-resolution imaging, and a set of 38 precise radial-velocities from HARPS-N and HIRES. We measure
a planet mass of $6.91^{+0.75}_{-0.85}$ M$_{\oplus}$, which implies an iron core mass fraction
of $20^{+15}_{-12}$% in the absence of a gaseous envelope. The bulk composition of TOI-1235 b is
therefore consistent with being Earth-like and we constrain a H/He envelope mass fraction to be
$<0.5$% at 90% confidence. Our results are consistent with model predictions from thermally-driven
atmospheric mass loss but not with gas-poor formation, suggesting that the former class of processes
remain efficient at sculpting close-in planets around early M dwarfs. Our RV analysis also reveals
a strong periodicity close to the first harmonic of the photometrically-determined stellar rotation
period that we treat as stellar activity, despite other lines of evidence favoring a planetary origin
($P=21.8^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$ days, $m_p\sin{i}=13.0^{+3.8}_{-5.3}$ M$_{\oplus}$) that cannot
be firmly ruled out by our data.
