The formation of a large-scale current sheet is a generic feature of pulsar magnetospheres. If the
magnetic axis is misaligned with the star rotation axis, the current sheet is an oscillatory structure
filling an equatorial wedge determined by the inclination angle, known as the striped wind. Relativistic
reconnection could lead to significant dissipation of magnetic energy and particle acceleration
although the efficiency of this process is debated in this context. In this study, we aim at reconciling
global models of pulsar wind dynamics and reconnection in the stripes within the same numerical
framework, in order to shed new light on dissipation and particle acceleration in pulsar winds.
To this end, we perform large three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of a split-monopole
magnetosphere, from the stellar surface up to fifty light-cylinder radii away from the pulsar.
Plasmoid-dominated reconnection efficiently fragments the current sheet into a dynamical network
of interacting flux ropes separated by secondary current sheets which consume the field efficiently
at all radii, even past the fast magnetosonic point. Our results suggest there is a universal dissipation
radius solely determined by the reconnection rate in the sheet, lying well upstream the termination
shock radius in isolated pair producing pulsars. The wind bulk Lorentz factor is much less relativistic
than previously thought. In the comoving frame, the wind is composed of hot pairs trapped within
flux ropes with a hard broad power-law spectrum, whose maximum energy is limited by the magnetization
of the wind at launch. We conclude that the striped wind is most likely fully dissipated when it enters
the pulsar wind nebula. The predicted wind particle spectrum after dissipation is reminiscent
of the Crab Nebula radio-emitting electrons.
