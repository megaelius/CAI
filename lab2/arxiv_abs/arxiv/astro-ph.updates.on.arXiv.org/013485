We report the discovery of a Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) candidate occurring in the Active Galactic
Nucleus SDSS J022700.77-042020.6. A sudden increase in flux of J0227-0420 during the second half
of 2009 is clearly shown in the long-term optical, UV, and NIR light curves. A plateau phase, following
an initial decline, is seen in the NUV and optical u, g, r, i light curves. Moreover, we find possible
evidence that the plateau phase in the NUV band may lag behind the optical ones by approximately 70-80
days with also a much shorter duration, i.e. $\sim$7-15 days against $\sim$40-50 days. The long-term
NUV/optical (after the plateau phase), NIR and MIR light curves can be well characterized with a
form of $L(t)\propto t^{-\beta}$, consistent with the expectation of a TDE. The plateaus can be
explained if the stellar streams collide with the pre-existing AGN disk at different radii. Though
the overall fallback rate decreases, the material in the outer disk gradually drifts inward and
increases the local accretion rate at the inner region, producing the optical and UV plateaus. The
possible lag between the optical and NUV plateaus can then be attributed to viscosity delay. The
index $\beta$ of the NIR $J, H, K_s$ bands ($\sim1.4-3.3$) is steeper than that of the UV/optical
($\sim0.7-1.3$) and MIR bands ($\sim0.9-1.8$), which may suggest that a certain fraction of the
dust in the inner region of the dusty torus may be sublimated during the TDE phase. Our results indicate
that, due to collisions between stellar debris and pre-existing disk, the light curves of TDEs occurring
in AGN may show distinctive features, which may shed new light on the accretion process.
