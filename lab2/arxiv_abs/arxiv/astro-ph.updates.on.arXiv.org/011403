It has been established for decades that rotation curves deviate from the Newtonian gravity expectation
given baryons alone below a characteristic acceleration scale $g_\dagger \sim 10^{-8}\,\rm{cm\,s^{-2}}$,
a scale promoted to a new fundamental constant in MOND-type theories. In recent years, theoretical
and observational studies have shown that the star formation efficiency (SFE) of dense gas scales
with surface density, SFE $\sim \Sigma/\Sigma_{\rm crit}$ with $\Sigma_{\rm crit} \sim (\dot{p}/m_{\ast})/(\pi^{2}\,G)\sim
1000\,\rm{M_{\odot}\,pc^{-2}}$ (where $\dot{p}/m_{\ast}$ is the momentum flux output by stellar
feedback per unit stellar mass formed). We show that the star formation efficiency, more correctly,
scales with the gravitational acceleration, i.e. that SFE $\sim g_{\rm tot}/g_{\rm crit} \equiv
(G\,M_{\rm enc}/R^{2}) / ([\dot{p}/m_{\ast}]/\pi)$, where $M_{\rm enc}(<r)$ is the total gravitating
mass and $g_{\rm crit}=(\dot{p}/m_{\ast})/\pi = \pi\,G\,\Sigma_{\rm crit} \approx 10^{-8}\,\rm{cm\,s^{-2}}
\approx g_\dagger$. It follows that the characteristic galactic acceleration $g_\dagger$ corresponds
to the acceleration scale above which SF is `efficient' (and outflows `inefficient'), and so baryons
inevitably dominate the mass. This also explains the ``deep MOND'' scaling $g_{\rm obs}\sim(g_{\rm
baryon}\,g_\dagger)^{1/2}$ (where $g_{\rm baryon}$ is the acceleration due to baryons alone)
apparent at low accelerations. We further show that $g_\dagger$ can be expressed in terms of fundamental
constants (gravitational constant, proton mass, and Thomson cross-section): $g_\dagger\sim
0.1\,G\,m_{p}/\sigma_{\rm T}$.
