We study the statistical properties of 320 bulges of disk galaxies in the Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy
Survey, using robust structural parameters of galaxies derived from image fitting. We apply the
Kormendy relation to classify classical and pseudo bulges and characterize bulge dichotomy with
respect to bulge structural properties and physical properties of host galaxies. We confirm previous
findings that pseudo bulges on average have smaller S\'{e}rsic indices, smaller bulge-to-total
ratios, and fainter surface brightnesses when compared with classical bulges. Our sizable sample
statistically shows that pseudo bulges are more intrinsically flattened than classical bulges.
Pseudo bulges are most frequent (incidence $\gtrsim 80\%$) in late-type spirals (later than Sc).
Our measurements support the picture in which pseudo bulges arose from star formation induced by
inflowing gas, while classical bulges were born out of violent processes such as mergers and coalescence
of clumps. We reveal differences with the literature that warrant attention: (1) the bimodal distribution
of S\'{e}rsic indices presented by previous studies is not reproduced in our study; (2) classical
and pseudo bulges have similar relative bulge sizes; and (3) the pseudo bulge fraction is considerably
smaller in early-type disks compared with previous studies based on one-dimensional surface brightness
profile fitting. We attribute the above differences to our improved image quality, more robust
bulge-to-disk decomposition technique, and different classification criteria applied. Moreover,
we find that barred galaxies do not host more pseudo bulges or more prominent pseudo bulges than unbarred
galaxies. Various implications of these findings are discussed.
