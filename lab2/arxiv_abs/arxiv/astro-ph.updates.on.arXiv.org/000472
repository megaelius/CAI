[Abridged] The central field of the Andromeda galaxy (M 31) has been monitored, using the Chandra
HRC-I detector (about 0.1-10 keV energy range) from 2006 to 2012 with the main aim to detect X-rays
from optical novae. We present a systematic analysis of all X-ray sources found in the 41 nova monitoring
observations, along with 23 M 31 central field HRC-I observations available from the Chandra data
archive starting in December 1999. Based on these observations, we studied the X-ray long-term
variability of the source population and especially of X-ray binaries in M 31. We created a catalogue
of sources, detected in the 64 available observations, which add up to a total exposure of about 1
Ms. We present a point-source catalogue, containing 318 X-ray sources with detailed long-term
variability information, 28 of which are published for the first time. The spatial and temporal
resolution of the catalogue allows us to classify 115 X-ray binary candidates showing high X-ray
variability or even outbursts in addition to 14 globular cluster X-ray binary candidates showing
no significant variability. The analysis may suggest, that outburst sources are less frequent
in globular clusters than in the field of M 31. We detected 7 supernova remnants, one of which is a new
candidate and in addition resolved the first X-rays from a known radio supernova remnant. Besides
33 known optical nova/X-ray source correlations, we also discovered one previously unknown super-soft
X-ray outburst and several new nova candidates. The catalogue contains a large sample of detailed
long-term X-ray light curves in the M 31 central field, which helps to understand the X-ray population
of our neighbouring spiral galaxy M 31.
