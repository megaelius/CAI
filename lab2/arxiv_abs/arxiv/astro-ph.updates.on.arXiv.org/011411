Recent work suggests that many short-period super-Earth and sub-Neptune planets may have significant
spin axis tilts ("obliquities"). When planets are locked in high-obliquity states, the tidal dissipation
rate may increase by several orders of magnitude. This intensified heat deposition within the planets'
interiors should generate significant structural consequences, including atmospheric inflation
leading to larger transit radii. Using up-to-date radius estimates from Gaia Data Release 2, we
show evidence for $\sim50\%$ larger average radii of planets wide of first-order mean-motion resonances,
a population of planets with a theorized frequent occurrence of high obliquities. We investigate
whether this radius trend could be a signature of obliquity tides. Using an adaptation of the Modules
for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) stellar evolution toolkit, we model the atmospheric
evolution of sub-Neptune-mass planets in response to additional internal heat from obliquity
tides. The degree of radius inflation predicted by the models is $\sim10\%-100\%$ for tidal luminosities
$\gtrsim 10^{-5}$ of the incident stellar power; this degree of inflation is broadly consistent
with the observations and can approximately be described by power law relationships. We present
a few case studies of very low density "super-puff" planets -- Kepler-79 d, Kepler-31 c, and Kepler-27
b -- and show that they are strong candidates for potentially having undergone tidally-induced
radius inflation. We also discuss how the discrepancy between the two populations of planets with
masses derived from radial velocities and transit timing variations is connected to the radius
distribution features we have identified. Altogether, the calculations in this work confirm that
tidal dissipation has non-negligible consequences for the structural properties of short-period
sub-Neptunes.
