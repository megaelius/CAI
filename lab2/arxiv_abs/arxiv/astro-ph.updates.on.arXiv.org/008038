Short-period planets suffer from extreme tidal forces from their parent stars causing them to deform
and attain non-spherical shapes. The planet shapes, modeled here as triaxial ellipsoids, can have
an impact on the observed transit light curves and the planetary parameters derived. We investigate
the detectability of tidal deformation in short-period planets from their transit light curves
and the instrumental precision needed. We show how the detection of deformation from the light curve
allows us to obtain an observational estimate of the second fluid Love number which gives valuable
insight about the planet's internal structure. We adopted a model to calculate the shape of a planet
due to the external potentials acting on it and used this model to modify the ellc transit tool. Our
model is parameterized by the Love number, hence for a given light curve we can derive the value of
the Love number that best matches the observations. We simulated the known cases of WASP-103b and
WASP-121b expected to be highly deformed. Our analyses showed that instrumental precision $\leq$50ppm/min
is needed to reliably estimate the Love number and detect tidal deformation. This precision can
be achieved for WASP-103b in ~40 transits using HST and in ~300 transits using the forthcoming CHEOPS.
However, fewer transits will be required for short-period planets that may be found around bright
stars in the TESS and PLATO survey missions. The unprecedented precisions expected from PLATO and
JWST can permit the detection of deformation with a single transit. However, the effects of instrumental
and astrophysical noise must be well-considered as they can increase the number of transits required
to reach the 50 ppm/min detection limit. We also show that improper modeling of limb darkening can
act to bury signals related to the planet's shape thereby leading us to infer sphericity for a deformed
planet.
