Transient LMXBs that host neutron stars (NSs) provide excellent laboratories for probing the dense
matter physics present in NS crusts. During accretion outbursts in LMXBs, exothermic reactions
may heat the NS crust, disrupting the crust-core equilibrium. When the outburst ceases, the crust
cools to restore thermal equilibrium with the core. Monitoring this evolution allows us to probe
the dense matter physics in the crust. Properties of the deeper crustal layers can be probed at later
times after the end of the outburst. We report on the unexpected late-time temperature evolution
(>2000 days after the end of their outbursts) of two NSs in LMXBs, XTE J1701-462 and EXO 0748-676.
Although both these sources exhibited very different outbursts (in terms of duration and the average
accretion rate), they exhibit an unusually steep decay of ~7 eV in the observed effective temperature
(occurring in a time span of ~700 days) around ~2000 days after the end of their outbursts. Furthermore,
they both showed an even more unexpected rise of ~3 eV in temperature (over a time period of ~500-2000
days) after this steep decay. This rise was significant at the 2.4{\sigma} and 8.5{\sigma} level
for XTE J1701-462 and EXO 0748-676, respectively. The physical explanation for such behaviour
is unknown and cannot be straightforwardly be explained within the cooling hypothesis. In addition,
this observed evolution cannot be well explained by low-level accretion either without invoking
many assumptions. We investigate the potential pathways in the theoretical heating and cooling
models that could reproduce this unusual behaviour, which so far has been observed in two crust-cooling
sources. Such a temperature increase has not been observed in the other NS crust-cooling sources
at similarly late times, although it cannot be excluded that this might be a result of the inadequate
sampling obtained at such late times.
