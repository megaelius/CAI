Recent interest in primordial black holes as a possible dark matter candidate has motivated the
reanalysis of previous methods for constraining massive astrophysical compact objects in the
Milky Way halo and beyond. In order to derive these constraints, a model for the dark matter distribution
around the Milky Way must be used. Previous microlensing searches have assumed a semi-isothermal
density sphere for this task. We show this model is no longer consistent with data from the Milky Way
rotation curve, and test two replacement models, namely NFW and power-law. The power-law model
is the most flexible as it can break spherical symmetry, and best fits the data. Thus, we recommend
the power-law model as a replacement, although it still lacks the flexibility to fully encapsulate
all possible shapes of the Milky Way halo. We then use the power-law model to rederive some previous
microlensing constraints in the literature, while propagating the primary halo-shape uncertainties
through to our final constraints. Our analysis reveals that the microlensing constraints towards
the Large Magellanic Cloud weaken somewhat for MACHO masses around $10\, M_\odot$ when this uncertainty
is taken into account, but the constraints tighten at lower masses. Exploring some of the simplifying
assumptions of previous constraints we also study the effect of wide mass distributions of compact
halo objects, as well as the effect of spatial clustering on microlensing constraints. We find that
both effects induce a shift in the constraints towards smaller masses, and can effectively remove
the microlensing constraints from $M \sim 1-10 M_\odot$ for certain MACHO populations.
