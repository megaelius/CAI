We have studied the simultaneous and separate solutions of the basic kinematic equations obtained
using the stellar velocities calculated on the basis of data from the Gaia TGAS and RAVE5 catalogues.
By comparing the values of Omega_0' found by separately analyzing only the line-of-sight velocities
of stars and only their proper motions, we have determined the distance scale correction factor
p to be close to unity, 0.97+/-0.04. Based on the proper motions of stars from the Gaia TGAS catalogue
with relative trigonometric parallax errors less than 10% (they are at a mean distance of 226 pc),
we have found the components of the group velocity vector for the sample stars relative to the Sun
(U,V,W)o=(9.28,20.35,7.36)+/-(0.05,0.07,0.05) km s^{-1}, the angular velocity of Galactic
rotation Omega0=27.24+/-0.30 km s^{-1} kpc^{-1}, and its first derivative Omega_0'=-3.77+/-0.06
km s^{-1} kpc^{-2}; here, the circular rotation velocity of the Sun around the Galactic center is
V_0=218+/-6 km s^{-1} kpc (for the adopted distance R_0=8.0+/-0.2 kpc), while the Oort constants
are A=15.07+/-0.25 km s^{-1} kpc^{-1} and B=-12.17+/-0.39 km s^{-1} kpc^{-1}, p=0.98+/-0.08.
The kinematics of Gaia TGAS stars with parallax errors more than 10% has been studied by invoking
the distances from a paper by Astraatmadja and Bailer-Jones that were corrected for the Lutz-Kelker
bias. We show that the second derivative of the angular velocity of Galactic rotation Omega_0"=0.864+/-0.021
km s^{-1} kpc^{-3} is well determined from stars at a mean distance of 537 pc. On the whole, we have
found that the distances of stars from the Gaia TGAS catalogue calculated using their trigonometric
parallaxes do not require any additional correction factor.
