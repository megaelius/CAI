We determine the observability in transmission of inhomogeneous cloud cover on the limbs of hot
Jupiters through post processing a general circulation model to include cloud distributions computed
using a cloud microphysics model. We find that both the east and west limb often form clouds, but that
the different properties of these clouds enhances the limb to limb differences compared to the clear
case. Using JWST it should be possible to detect the presence of cloud inhomogeneities by comparing
the shape of the transit lightcurve at multiple wavelengths because inhomogeneous clouds impart
a characteristic, wavelength dependent signature. This method is statistically robust even with
limited wavelength coverage, uncertainty on limb darkening coefficients, and imprecise transit
times. We predict that the short wavelength slope varies strongly with temperature. The hot limb
of the hottest planets form higher altitude clouds composed of smaller particles leading to a strong
rayleigh slope. The near infrared spectral features of clouds are almost always detectable, even
when no spectral slope is visible in the optical. In some of our models a spectral window between 5
and 9 microns can be used to probe through the clouds and detect chemical spectral features. Our cloud
particle size distributions are not log-normal and differ from species to species. Using the area
or mass weighted particle size significantly alters the relative strength of the cloud spectral
features compared to using the predicted size distribution. Finally, the cloud content of a given
planet is sensitive to a species' desorption energy and contact angle, two parameters that could
be constrained experimentally in the future.
