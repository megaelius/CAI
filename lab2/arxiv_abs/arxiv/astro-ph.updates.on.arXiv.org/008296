We study the implications of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) data from the Pierre Auger Observatory
for potential accelerator candidates and cosmogenic neutrino fluxes for different combinations
of nuclear disintegration and air-shower models. We exploit the most recent spectral and mass composition
data (2017) with a new, computationally very efficient simulation code PriNCe. We extend the systematic
framework originally developed by the Pierre Auger Collaboration with the cosmological source
evolution as an additional free parameter. In this framework, an ensemble of generalized UHECR
accelerators is characterized by a universal spectral index (equal for all injection species),
a maximal rigidity, and the normalizations for five nuclear element groups. We find that the 2017
data favor a small but constrained contribution of heavy elements (iron) at the source. We demonstrate
that the results moderately depend on the nuclear disintegration (PSB, Peanut, or Talys) model,
and more strongly on the air-shower (EPOS-LHC, Sibyll-2.3, or QGSjet-II-04) model. Variations
of these models result in different source evolutions and spectral indices, limiting the interpretation
in terms of a particular class of cosmic accelerators. Better constrained parameters include the
maximal rigidity and the mass composition at the source. Hence, the cosmogenic neutrino flux can
be robustly predicted, since it originates from interactions with the cosmic infrared background
and peaks at $10^8 \, \mathrm{GeV}$. Depending on the source evolution at high redshifts the flux
is likely out of reach of future neutrino observatories in most cases, and a minimal cosmogenic neutrino
flux cannot be claimed from data without assuming a cosmological distribution of the sources.
