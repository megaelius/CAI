Leo T is a gas-rich dwarf located at 414kpc $(1.4R_{\rm vir})$ distance from the Milky Way (MW) and
it is currently assumed to be on its first approach. Here, we present an analysis of orbits calculated
backward in time for the dwarf with our new code {\sc delorean}, exploring a range of systematic uncertainties,
e.g. MW virial mass and accretion, M31 potential, and cosmic expansion. We discover that orbits
with tangential velocities in the Galactic Standard-of-Rest frame lower than $|\vec{u}_{\rm
t}^{\rm GSR}|\!\leq\! 63^{+47}_{-39}{\rm\, km\, s^{-1}}$ result in backsplash solutions, i.e.
orbits that entered and left the MW dark matter halo in the past, and that velocities above $|\vec{u}_{\rm
t}^{\rm GSR}|\!\geq\!21^{+33}_{-21}{\rm\, km\, s^{-1}}$ result in wide orbit backsplash solutions
with a minimum pericenter range of $D_{\rm min}\!\geq\!38^{+26}_{-16}{\rm \,kpc}$, which would
allow this satellite to survive gas stripping and tidal disruption. Moreover, new proper motion
estimates match with our region of backsplash solutions. %This suggests that Leo T is likely a pristine
system. We applied our method to other distant MW satellites, finding a range of gas stripped backsplash
solutions for the gas-less Cetus and Eridanus II, providing a possible explanation for their lack
of cold gas, while only first in-fall solutions are found for the HI rich Phoenix I. We also find that
the cosmic expansion can delay their first pericenter passage when compared to the non-expanding
scenario. This study explores the provenance of these distant dwarfs and provides constraints
on the environmental and internal processes that shaped their evolution and current properties.
