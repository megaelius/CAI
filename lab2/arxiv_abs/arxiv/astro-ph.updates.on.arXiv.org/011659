Coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are among the most magnificent solar eruptions, are a major
driver of space weather and can thus affect diverse human technologies. Different processes have
been proposed to explain the initiation and release of CMEs from solar active regions (ARs), without
reaching consensus on which is the predominant scenario, and thus rendering impossible to accurately
predict when a CME is going to erupt from a given AR. To investigate AR magnetic properties that favor
CMEs production, we employ multi-spacecraft data to analyze a long duration AR (NOAA 11089, 11100,
11106, 11112 and 11121) throughout its complete lifetime, spanning five Carrington rotations
from July to November 2010. We use data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory to study the evolution
of the AR magnetic properties during the five near-side passages, and a proxy to follow the magnetic
flux changes when no magnetograms are available, i.e. during far-side transits. We characterized
the angular widths, speeds and masses of 108 CMEs that we associated to the AR, when examining a 124-day
period. Such an ejectivity tracking was possible thanks to the multiviewpoint images provided
by the STEREO and SOHO in a quasiquadrature configuration. We also inspected the X-ray flares registered
by the GOES satellite and found 162 to be associated to the AR under study. Given the substantial number
of ejections studied, we use a statistical approach instead of a single-event analysis. We found
three well defined periods of very high CMEs activity and two periods with no mass ejections that
are preceded or accompanied by characteristic changes in the AR magnetic flux, free magnetic energy
and/or presence of electric currents. Our large sample of CMEs and long term study of a single AR,
provide further evidence relating AR magnetic activity to CME and Flare production.
