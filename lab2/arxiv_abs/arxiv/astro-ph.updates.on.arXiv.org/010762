Simultaneous measurements of distance and redshift can be used to constrain the expansion history
of the universe and associated cosmological parameters. Merging binary black hole (BBH) systems
are standard sirens---their gravitational waveform provides direct information about the luminosity
distance to the source. Because gravity is scale-free, there is a perfect degeneracy between the
source masses and redshift; some non-gravitational information is necessary to break the degeneracy
and determine the redshift of the source. Here we suggest that the pair instability supernova (PISN)
process, thought to be the source of the observed upper-limit on the black hole (BH) mass in merging
BBH systems at $\sim 45 \, M_\odot$, imprints a mass scale in the population of BBH mergers and permits
a measurement of the redshift-luminosity-distance relation with these sources. We simulate five
years of BBH detections in the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors with realistic assumptions about
the BBH merger rate, a mass distribution incorporating a smooth PISN cutoff, and measurement uncertainty.
We show that after one year of operation at design sensitivity (circa 2021) the BBH population can
constrain $H(z)$ to $6.1\%$ at a pivot redshift $z \simeq 0.8$. After five years (circa 2025) the
constraint improves to $2.9\%$. This measurement relies only on general relativity and the presence
of a cutoff mass scale that is approximately fixed or calibrated across cosmic time; it is independent
of any distance ladder or cosmological model. Observations by future ``third-generation'' gravitational
wave detectors, which can see BBH mergers throughout the universe, would permit sub-percent cosmographical
measurements to $z \gtrsim 4$ within one month of observation.
