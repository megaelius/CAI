(abridged) Vortex coronagraphs are among the most promising solutions to perform high contrast
imaging at small angular separations. They feature a very small inner working angle, a clear 360
degree discovery space, have demonstrated very high contrast capabilities, are easy to implement
on high-contrast imaging instruments, and have already been extensively tested on the sky. Since
2005, we have been designing, developing and testing an implementation of the charge-2 vector vortex
phase mask based on concentric subwavelength gratings, referred to as the Annular Groove Phase
Mask (AGPM). Science-grade mid-infrared AGPMs were produced in 2012 for the first time, using plasma
etching on synthetic diamond substrates. They have been validated on a coronagraphic test bench,
showing broadband peak rejection up to 500:1 in the L band, which translates into a raw contrast of
about $6\times 10^{-5}$ at $2 \lambda/D$. Three of them have now been installed on world-leading
diffraction-limited infrared cameras (VLT/NACO, VLT/VISIR and LBT/LMIRCam). During the science
verification observations with our L-band AGPM on NACO, we observed the beta Pictoris system and
obtained unprecedented sensitivity limits to planetary companions down to the diffraction limit
($0.1''$). More recently, we obtained new images of the HR 8799 system at L band during the AGPM first
light on LMIRCam. After reviewing these first results obtained with mid-infrared AGPMs, we will
discuss the short- and mid-term goals of the on-going VORTEX project, which aims to improve the performance
of our vortex phase masks for future applications on second-generation high-contrast imagers
and on future extremely large telescopes (ELTs).
