SN2017egm is the closest (z=0.03) H-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) detected to date, and
a rare example of an SLSN-I in a massive and metal-rich galaxy. Here we present the HST UV & optical
spectra covering (1000 - 5500)A taken at +3 day relative to the peak. Our data reveal two sets of absorption
systems, separated by 235 km/s, at redshifts matching the host galaxy, NGC3191 and its companion
galaxy 73 arcsec apart. Weakly damped Lyman-alpha absorption lines are detected at these two redshifts,
with HI column densities of $(3.0\pm0.8)\times10^{19}$ and $(3.7\pm0.9)\times10^{19}$\,cm$^{-2}$
respectively. This is an order of magnitude smaller than HI column densities in the disks of nearby
galaxies ($>10^{10}M_\odot$) and suggests that SN2017egm is on the near side of NGC3191 and has
a low host extinction (E(B-V)=0.007). Using unsaturated metal absorption lines and taking into
account of H ionization and dust depletion corrections, we find that the host of SN2017egm probably
has a solar or higher metallicity and is unlikely to be a dwarf companion to NGC3191. Comparison of
early-time UV spectra of SN2017egm, Gaia16apd, iPTF13ajg and PTF12dam finds that the continuum
at wavelength > 2800A is well fit by a blackbody, whereas the continuum at wavelength < 2800A is considerably
below the model. The degree of UV suppression varies from source to source, with the 1400A to 2800A
continuum flux ratio of 1.5 for Gaia16apd and 0.4 for iPTF13ajg. This can not be explained by the differences
in magnetar power or blackbody temperature (i.e. color temperature). Finally, the UV spectra reveal
a common set of seven broad absorption features and their equivalent widths are similar (within
a factor of 2) among the four events. These seven features bode well for future high-z SLSN-I spectral
classifications.
