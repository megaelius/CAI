(Abridged) We explore the massive cluster XMMXCSJ2215.9-1738 at z~1.5 with KMOS spectroscopy
of Halpha and [NII] covering a region that corresponds to about one virial radius. Using published
spectroscopic redshifts of 108 galaxies in and around the cluster we computed the location of galaxies
in the projected velocity vs. position phase-space to separate our cluster sample into a virialized
region of objects accreted longer ago (roughly inside half R200) and a region of infalling galaxies.
We measured oxygen abundances for ten cluster galaxies with detected [NII] lines in the individual
galaxy spectra and compared the MZR of the galaxies inside half R200 with the infalling galaxies
and a field sample at similar redshifts. We find that the oxygen abundances of individual z~1.5 star-forming
cluster galaxies inside half R200 are comparable, at the respective stellar mass, to the higher
local SDSS metallicity values. We find that the [NII]/Halpha line ratios inside half R200 are higher
by 0.2 dex and that the resultant metallicities of the galaxies in the inner part of the cluster are
higher by about 0.1 dex, at a given mass, than the metallicities of infalling galaxies and of field
galaxies at z~1.5. The enhanced metallicities of cluster galaxies at z~1.5 inside half R200 indicate
that the density of the ICM in this massive cluster becomes high enough toward the cluster center
such that the ram pressure exceeds the restoring pressure of the hot gas reservoir of cluster galaxies.
This can remove the gas reservoir initiating quenching; although the galaxies continue to form
stars, albeit at slightly lower rates, using the available cold gas in the disk which is not stripped.
