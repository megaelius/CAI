In the current model of early Solar System evolution, the stable members of the Jovian and Neptunian
Trojan populations were captured into resonance from the protoplanetesimal disk during the outward
migration of the giant planets. As a result, both Jovian and Neptunian Trojans share a common origin
with the primordial disk population, whose other surviving members constitute today's trans-Neptunian
object (TNO) populations. The cold classical TNOs are ultra-red, while the dynamically excited
"hot" population of TNOs contains a mixture of red and blue objects. In contrast, Jovian and Neptunian
Trojans are observed to be blue. While the absence of ultra-red Jovian Trojans can be readily explained
by the sublimation of volatile material from their surfaces due to the high flux of solar radiation
at 5 AU, the lack of red Neptunian Trojans presents both a puzzle and a challenge to formation models.
In this work we report the discovery by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) of two new dynamically stable
L4 Neptunian Trojans, 2013 VX30 and 2014 UU240, both with inclinations >30 degrees, making them
the highest-inclination known stable Neptunian Trojans. We have measured the colors of these and
three other dynamically stable Neptunian Trojans previously observed by DES, and find that2013
VX30 is ultra-red, the first such Neptunian Trojan in its class. As such, 2013 VX30 may be a "missing
link" between the Trojan and TNO populations. Using a simulation of the DES TNO detection efficiency,
we find that there are 162 +/- 73 Trojans with Hr < 10 at the L4 Lagrange point of Neptune. Moreover,
the blue-to-red Neptunian Trojan population ratio should be higher than 5:1. Based on this result,
we discuss the possible origin of the red Neptunian Trojan population and its implications for the
formation history of Neptunian Trojans.
