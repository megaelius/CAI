Galactic infrared (IR) bubbles, which can be seen as shell-like structures at mid-IR wavelengths,
are known to possess massive stars within their shell boundaries. In our previous study, Hanaoka
et al. (2019) expanded the research area to the whole Galactic plane ($0^{\circ} \leq l \leq 360^{\circ}$,
$|b| \leq 5^{\circ}$) and studied systematic differences in the shell morphology and the IR luminosity
of the IR bubbles between inner and outer Galactic regions. In this study, utilizing high spatial-resolution
data of AKARI and WISE in the mid-IR and Herschel in the far-IR, we investigate the spatial distributions
of dust components around each IR bubble to discuss the relation between the star-formation activity
and the dust properties of the IR bubbles. For the 247 IR bubbles studied in Hanaoka et al. (2019),
165 IR bubbles are investigated in this study, which have the Herschel data ($|b| \leq 1^{\circ}$)
and known distances. We created their spectral energy distributions on a pixel-by-pixel basis
around each IR bubble, and decomposed them with a dust model consisting of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs), hot dust, warm dust and cold dust. As a result, we find that the offsets of dust heating sources
from the shell centers in inner Galactic regions are systematically larger than those in outer Galactic
regions. Many of the broken bubbles in inner Galactic regions show large angles between the offset
and the broken shell directions from the center. Moreover, the spatial variations of the PAH intensity
and cold dust emissivity around the IR bubbles in inner Galactic regions are larger than those in
outer Galactic regions. We discuss these results in light of the interstellar environments and
the formation mechanism of the massive stars associated with the IR bubbles.
