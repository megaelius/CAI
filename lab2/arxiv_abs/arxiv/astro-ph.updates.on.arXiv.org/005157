The fraction of ionizing photons that escape high-redshift galaxies sensitively determines whether
galaxies reionized the early universe. However, this escape fraction cannot be measured from high-redshift
galaxies because the opacity of the intergalactic medium is large at high-redshifts. Without methods
to indirectly measure the escape fraction of high-redshift galaxies, it is unlikely that we will
know what reionized the universe. Here, we analyze the far-ultraviolet H I (Lyman series) and low-ionization
metal absorption lines of nine low-redshift, confirmed Lyman continuum emitting galaxies. We
use the H I covering fractions, column densities, and dust attenuations measured in a companion
paper to predict the escape fraction of ionizing photons. We find good agreement between the predicted
and observed Lyman continuum escape fractions (within $1.4\sigma$) using both the H I and the Si
II absorption lines. The ionizing photons escape through holes in the H I, but we show that dust attenuation
reduces the fraction of photons that escape galaxies. This means that the average high-redshift
galaxy likely emits more ionizing photons than low-redshift galaxies. Two other indirect methods
accurately predict the escape fractions: the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction and the optical [O III]/[O
II] flux ratio. We use these indirect methods to predict the escape fraction of a sample of 21 galaxies
with rest-frame ultraviolet spectra but without Lyman continuum observations. Many of these galaxies
have low escape fractions ($f_\text{esc}\le 1$%), but eleven have escape fractions $>1$%. The
methods presented here will measure the escape fractions of high-redshift galaxies, enabling
future telescopes to determine whether star-forming galaxies reionized the early universe.
