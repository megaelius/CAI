The detection and characterization of gravitational wave signals from compact binary coalescence
events relies on accurate waveform templates in the frequency domain. The stationary phase approximation
(SPA) can be used to compute closed-form frequency-domain waveforms for non-precessing, quasi-circular
binary inspirals. However, until now, no fast frequency-domain waveforms have existed for generic,
spin-precessing quasi-circular compact binary inspirals. Templates for these systems have had
to be computed via a discrete Fourier transform of finely sampled time-domain waveforms, which
is far more computationally expensive than those constructed directly in the frequency-domain,
especially for those systems that are dominated by the inspiral part. There are two obstacles to
deriving frequency-domain waveforms for precessing systems: (i) the spin-precession equations
do not admit closed-form solutions for generic systems; (ii) the SPA fails catastrophically. Presently
there is no general solution to the first problem, so we must resort to numerical integration of the
spin precession equations. This is not a significant obstacle, as numerical integration on the
slow precession timescale adds very little to the computational cost of generating the waveforms.
Our main result is to solve the second problem, by providing an alternative to the SPA that we call
the method of Shifted Uniform Asymptotics, or SUA, that cures the divergences in the SPA. The construction
of frequency-domain templates using the SUA can be orders of magnitude more efficient than the time-domain
ones obtained through a discrete Fourier transform. Moreover, this method is very faithful to the
discrete Fourier transform, with mismatches on the order of $10^{-5}$.
