We present an estimate of the optical luminosity function (OLF) of LOFAR radio-selected quasars
(RSQs) at $1.4<z<5.0$ in the $9.3\:\textrm{deg}^{2}$ NOAO Deep Wide-field survey (NDWFS) of the
Bo\"otes field. The selection was based on optical/mid-ir photometry used to train three different
machine learning (ML) algorithms. Objects taken as quasars by the ML algorithms are required to
be detected at $5\sigma$ significance in deep radio maps to be classified as candidate quasars.
The optical imaging came from the SDSS and the PS1 $3\pi$ survey; mid-ir photometry was taken from
the SDWFS survey; and radio data was obtained from deep LOFAR imaging of the NDWFS-Bo\"otes field.
The requirement of a $5\sigma$ LOFAR detection allowed us to reduce the stellar contamination in
our sample by two orders of magnitude. The sample comprises 134 objects, including both photometrically
selected candidate quasars (47) and spectroscopically confirmed quasars (83). The depth of our
LOFAR observations allowed us to detect the radio-emission of quasars that would be otherwise classified
as radio-quiet. Around $65\%$ of the quasars in the sample are fainter than $M_{\textrm{1450}}<-24.0$,
a regime where the OLF of quasars selected through their radio emission, has not been investigated
in detail. It has been demonstrated that in cases where mid-ir wedge-based AGN selection is not possible
due to a lack of appropriate data, the selection of quasars using ML algorithms trained with optical/mid-ir
photometry in combination with LOFAR data provides an excellent approach for obtaining samples
of quasars. We demonstrate that RSQs show an evolution similar to the exhibited by faint quasars
$(M_{\textrm{1450}}<-22.0)$. Finally, we find that RSQs may compose up to $\sim20\%$ of the whole
faint quasar population (radio-detected plus radio-undetected).
