Individual mainstream stardust silicon carbide (SiC) grains and a SiC-enriched bulk sample from
the Murchison carbonaceous meteorite have been analyzed by the Sensitive High Resolution Ion Microprobe
- Reverse Geometry (SHRIMP-RG) for Eu isotopes. The mainstream grains are believed to have condensed
in the outflows of 1.5 to 3 Msun carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with close-to-solar
metallicity. The 151Eu fractions [fr(151Eu) = 151Eu/(151Eu+153Eu)] derived from our measurements
are compared with previous astronomical observations of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars
enriched in elements made by slow neutron captures (the s-process). Despite the difference in metallicity
between the parent stars of the grains and the metal-poor stars, the fr(151Eu) values derived from
our measurements agree well with fr(151Eu) values derived from astronomical observations. We
have also compared the SiC data with theoretical predictions of the evolution of Eu isotopic ratios
in the envelope of AGB stars. Because of the low Eu abundances in the SiC grains, the fr(151Eu) values
derived from our measurements show large uncertainties, being in most cases larger than the difference
between solar and predicted fr(151Eu) values. The SiC aggregate yields a fr(151Eu) value within
the range observed in the single grains and provides a more precise result (fr(151Eu) = 0.54 +/- 0.03,
95 percent conf.), but is approximately 12 percent higher than current s-process predictions.
The AGB models can match the SiC data if we use an improved formalism to evaluate the contribution
of excited nuclear states in the calculation of the 151Sm(n,g) stellar reaction rate.
