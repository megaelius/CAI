We study the spatial clustering through the projected two-point correlation function of $632$
$(1130)$ XMM-COSMOS Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) with known spectroscopic (spectroscopic or
photometric) redshifts in the range $z = [0.1 - 2.5]$ in order to measure the AGN bias and estimate
the typical mass of the hosting dark matter (DM) halo as a function of AGN host galaxy properties.
We create AGN subsamples in terms of stellar mass $M_*$ and specific black hole accretion rate $L_X/M_*$,
to probe how AGN environment depends on these quantities. For the full spectroscopic AGN sample,
we measure a typical DM halo mass of $\log (M_\mathrm{halo} / h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot)= 12.79_{-0.43}^{+0.26}$,
similar to galaxy group environments and in line with previous studies for moderate-luminosity
X-ray selected AGN. We find no significant dependence on $L_X/M_*$, with $\log (M_\mathrm{halo}
/ h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot) = 13.06_{-0.38}^{+0.23}$ ($12.97_{-1.26}^{+0.39}$) for the low
(high) $L_X/M_*$ subsample. We also find no difference in the hosting halos in terms of $M_*$ with
$\log (M_\mathrm{halo} / h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot) = 12.93_{-0.62}^{+0.31}$ ($12.90_{-0.62}^{+0.30}$)
for the low (high) $M_*$ subsample. By comparing the $M_*-M_\mathrm{halo}$ relation derived for
XMM-COSMOS AGN subsamples with what is expected for normal non-active galaxies by abundance matching
and clustering results, we find that the typical DM halo mass of our high $M_*$ AGN subsample is similar
to that of non-active galaxies. However, AGNs in our low $M_*$ subsample are found in more massive
halos than non-active galaxies. By excluding AGNs in galaxy groups from the clustering analysis,
we find evidence that the result for low $M_*$ may be due a larger fraction of AGNs as satellites in
massive halos.
