We analyze age-velocity dispersion relations (AVRs) from kinematics of individual stars in eight
Local Group galaxies ranging in mass from Carina ($M_{*} \sim 10^{6}$) to M31 ($M_{*} \sim 10^{11}$).
Observationally the $\sigma$ vs. stellar age trends can be interpreted as dynamical heating of
the stars by GMCs, bars/spiral arms, or merging subhalos; alternatively the stars could have simply
been born out of a more turbulent ISM at high redshift and retain that larger velocity dispersion
till present day - consistent with recent IFU studies. To ascertain the dominant mechanism and better
understand the impact of instabilities and feedback, we develop models based on observed SFHs of
these Local Group galaxies in order to create an evolutionary formalism which describes the ISM
velocity dispersion due to a galaxy's evolving gas fraction. These empirical models relax the common
assumption that the stars are born from gas which has constant velocity dispersion at all redshifts.
Using only the observed SFHs as input, the ISM velocity dispersion and a mid-plane scattering model
fits the observed AVRs of low mass galaxies without fine tuning. Higher mass galaxies above $M_{vir}
> 10^{11}$ need a larger contribution from latent dynamical heating processes (for example minor
mergers), in excess of the ISM model. Using the SFHs we also find that supernovae feedback does not
appear to be a dominant driver of the gas velocity dispersion compared to gravitational instabilities
- at least for dispersions $\sigma \gtrsim 25$ km/s. Together our results point to stars being born
with a velocity dispersion close to that of the gas at the time of their formation, with latent dynamical
heating operating with a galaxy mass-dependent efficiency. These semi-empirical relations may
help constrain the efficiency of feedback and its impact on the physics of disk settling in galaxy
formation simulations.
