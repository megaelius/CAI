This study is part of the project ``CORE'', an IRAM/NOEMA large program consisting of observations
of the millimeter continuum and molecular line emission towards 20 selected high-mass star forming
regions. We focus on IRAS23385+6053, which is believed to be the least evolved source of the CORE
sample. The observations were performed at ~1.4 mm and employed three configurations of NOEMA and
additional single-dish maps, merged with the interferometric data to recover the extended emission.
Our correlator setup covered a number of lines from well-known hot core tracers and a few outflow
tracers. The angular (~0.45"$-$0.9") and spectral (0.5 km/s) resolutions were sufficient to resolve
the clump in IRAS23385+6053 and investigate the existence of large-scale motions due to rotation,
infall, or expansion. We find that the clump splits into six distinct cores when observed at sub-arcsecond
resolution. These are identified through their 1.4 mm continuum and molecular line emission. We
produce maps of the velocity, line width, and rotational temperature from the methanol and methyl
cyanide lines, which allow us to investigate the cores and reveal a velocity and temperature gradient
in the most massive core. We also find evidence of a bipolar outflow, possibly powered by a low-mass
star. We present the tentative detection of a circumstellar self-gravitating disk lying in the
most massive core and powering a large-scale outflow previously known in the literature. In our
scenario, the star powering the flow is responsible for most of the luminosity of IRAS23385+6053
(~$3000~L_\odot$). The other cores, albeit with masses below the corresponding virial masses,
appear to be accreting material from their molecular surroundings and are possibly collapsing
or on the verge of collapse. We conclude that we are observing a sample of star-forming cores that
is bound to turn into a cluster of massive stars.
