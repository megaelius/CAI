The DART spacecraft is planned to impact the secondary of the binary asteroid (65803) Didymos in
2022, to assess deflection strategies for planetary defense. The impact will create a crater and
release asteroidal material, some of which will escape the Didymos system. Because the closest
point of approach of Didymos to Earth's orbit is only 6 million km (about 16 times the Earth-Moon distance),
some ejected material will make its way sooner or later to our planet, and the observation of these
particles as meteors would increase the scientific payout of the DART mission. The DART project
may also represent the first human-generated meteoroids to reach Earth, and a test case for human
activity on asteroids and its eventual contribution to the meteoroid environment and spacecraft
impact risk. This study examines the amount and timing of the delivery of meteoroids from Didymos
to near-Earth space. Very little DART-ejected material will reach our planet, and most only after
thousands of years. But some material, the smallest particles and/or those ejected at the highest
velocities could be delivered to Earth-crossing trajectories almost immediately, though at very
low fluxes. Timing and radiant directions for material reaching the Earth are calculated, though
the detection of substantial numbers would indicate more abundant and/or faster ejecta than is
expected. The DART impact will also create a new meteoroid stream, though probably not a very dense
one. However, larger, more capable asteroid impactors could create meteoroid streams in which
the particle flux exceeds that naturally occurring in the Solar System, with implications for spacecraft
safety.
