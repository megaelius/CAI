Recent constraints on the splashback radius around optically selected galaxy clusters from the
redMaPPer cluster-finding algorithm in the literature have shown that the observed splashback
radius is $\sim 20\%$ smaller than that predicted by N-body simulations. We present analyses on
the splashback features around $\sim 3000$ optically selected galaxy clusters detected by the
independent cluster-finding algorithm CAMIRA over a wide redshift range of $0.1<z_{\rm cl}<1.0$
from the second public data release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program covering
$\sim 427~{\rm deg}^2$ for the cluster catalog. We detect the splashback feature from the projected
cross-correlation measurements between the clusters and photometric galaxies over the wide redshift
range, including for high redshift clusters at $0.7<z_{\rm cl}<1.0$, thanks to deep HSC images.
We find that constraints from red galaxy populations only are more precise than those without any
color cut, leading to $1\sigma$ precisions of $\sim 15\%$ at $0.4<z_{\rm cl}<0.7$ and $0.7<z_{\rm
cl}<1.0$. These constraints are more consistent with the model predictions ($\lesssim 1\sigma$)
than their $20\%$ smaller values as suggested by the previous studies with the redMaPPer ($\sim
2\sigma$). We also investigate selection effects of the optical cluster-finding algorithms on
the observed splashback features by creating mock galaxy catalogs from a halo occupation distribution
model, and find that such effects to be sub-dominant for the CAMIRA cluster-finding algorithm.
We also find that the redMaPPer-like cluster-finding algorithm induces a smaller inferred splashback
radius in our mock catalog, especially at lower richness, which can well explain the smaller splashback
radii in the literature. In contrast, these biases are significantly reduced when increasing its
aperture size.
