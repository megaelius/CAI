The deuterium fraction of N$_2$H$^+$, i.e. $D_{\rm frac}^{\rm N_2H^+}\equiv $[N$_2$D$^+$]/[N$_2$H$^+$],
may provide information about the ages of dense, cold gas structures, important to compare with
dynamical models of cloud core formation and evolution. Here we introduce a complete chemical network
with species containing up to three atoms. This gas-phase chemical model includes deuterium chemistry
and spin states of H$_2$ and H$_3^+$ isotopologues. We investigate dependence of deuterium chemistry
on model parameters: density ($n_{\rm H}$), temperature, cosmic ray ionization rate and gas-phase
depletion factor of heavy elements ($f_D$), including the effects of these parameters on equilibrium
values of the deuterium fraction and the timescale to approach this equilibrium. This timescale
is compared with the local free-fall and ambipolar diffusion timescales. We also explore the effects
of time-dependent freeze-out of gas-phase species onto dust grains and dynamical evolution of
density at various rates relative to free-fall collapse. For a broad range of model parameters,
the timescales to reach large values of $D_{\rm frac}^{\rm N_2H^+} \gtrsim 0.1$, observed in some
low- and high-mass starless cores, are relatively long compared to the local free-fall timescale.
These conclusions are unaffected by introducing time-dependent freeze-out and considering models
with evolving density, unless the initial $f_D \gtrsim$ 10. For fiducial model parameters, achieving
$D_{\rm frac}^{\rm N_2H^+} \gtrsim 0.1$ in cores with $n_{\rm H}\gtrsim10^6\:{\rm cm^{-3}}$
requires collapse to be proceeding at rates about 10 times slower than that of free-fall collapse,
perhaps indicating a dynamically important role for magnetic fields in the support of starless
cores and thus the regulation of star formation.
