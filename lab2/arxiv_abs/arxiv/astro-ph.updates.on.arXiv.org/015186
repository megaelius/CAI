We compare the spatial stellar color variations with our 3D model of the spatial dust distribution
to refine the properties of the dust layer in Galactic solar neighborhoods. We use a complete sample
of 93992 clump giants with an admixture of branch giants from the Gaia DR2 catalogue in a spatial cylinder
with a radius of 700 pc around the Sun extending to |Z|=1800 pc. Accurate data of these stars in the
Gaia DR2 GRP and WISE W3 bands have allowed the spatial GRP-W3 color variations to be used to calculate
the model parameters and two characteristics of the sample, the mode of the dereddened color (GRP-W3)0
of the giant clump and the linear change of this mode with coordinate |Z|. As a result, an improved
version of the three-dimensional model first proposed by Gontcharov (2009b) has been obtained.
As in the previous version, the model suggests two dust layers, along the Galactic equator and in
the Gould Belt, that intersect near the Sun at an angle of 18\pm2 degs. In contrast to the previous
version of the model with a midplane of the Gould Belt dust layer in the form of a circle with the center
at the Sun, in the new version this midplane is an ellipse decentered relative to the Sun. A scale height
of 170\pm40 pc has been found for both dust layers. The modes of the absolute magnitude MW3=-1.70\pm0.02
and the dereddened color (GRP-W3)0=(1.43\pm0.01)-(0.020\pm0.007)|Z|, where Z is expressed
in kpc, have been calculated for the giant clump near the Sun. The dispersions of the quantities under
consideration have allowed the natural small-scale density fluctuations of the dust medium relative
to the mean reddening calculated from the model to be characterized. These fluctuations make a major
contribution to the uncertainty in the reddening.
