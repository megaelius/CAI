We report the very bright detection of cold molecular gas with the IRAM NOEMA interferometer of the
strongly lensed source WISE J132934.18+224327.3 at z=2.04, the so-called Cosmic Eyebrow. This
source has a similar spectral energy distribution from optical-mid/IR to submm/radio but significantly
higher fluxes than the well-known lensed SMG SMMJ 2135, the Cosmic Eyelash at z=2.3. The interferometric
observations identify unambiguously the location of the molecular line emission in two components,
component CO32-A with I_CO(3-2)=52.2+-0.9 Jy km s^-1 and component CO32-B with I_CO(3-2)=15.7+-0.7
Jy km s^-1. Thus, our NOEMA observations of the CO(3-2) transition confirm the SMG-nature of WISE
J132934.18+224327.3, resulting in the brightest CO(3-2) detection ever of a SMG. In addition,
we present follow-up observations of the brighter component with the Green Bank Telescope (CO(1-0)
transition) and IRAM 30m telescope (CO(4-3) and [CI](1-0) transitions). The star-formation efficiency
of ~100 L_sun (K km s^-1 pc^2) is at the overlap region between merger-triggered and disk-like star-formation
activity and the lowest seen for lensed dusty star-forming galaxies. The determined gas depletion
time ~60~Myr, intrinsic infrared star-formation SFR_IR approx. 2000 M_sun yr^-1 and gas fraction
M_mol/M_star=0.44 indicates a starburst/merger triggered star-formation. The obtained data
of the cold ISM - from CO(1-0) and dust continuum - indicates a gas mass M_mol~15x10^11 M_sun for component
CO32-A. Its unseen brightness offers the opportunity to establish the Cosmic Eyebrow as a new reference
source at z=2 for galaxy evolution.
