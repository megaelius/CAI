Galaxy spectra are essential to probe the spatial distribution of galaxies in our Universe. To better
interpret current and future spectroscopic galaxy redshift surveys, it is important to be able
to simulate these data sets. We describe Uspec, a forward modeling tool to generate galaxy spectra
taking into account some intrinsic galaxy properties as well as instrumental responses of a given
telescope. The model for the intrinsic properties of the galaxy population, i.e., the luminosity
functions, and size and spectral coefficients distribu- tions, was developed in an earlier work
for broad-band imaging surveys [1], and we now aim to test the model further using spectroscopic
data. We apply Uspec to the SDSS/CMASS sample of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs). We construct selection
cuts that match those used to build this LRG sample, which we then apply to data and simulations in
the same way. The resulting real and simulated average spectra show a good statistical agreement
overall, with residual differences likely coming from a bluer galaxy population of the simulated
sam- ple. We also do not explore the impact of non-solar element ratios in our simulations. For a quantitative
comparison, we perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the sets of spectra. By comparing
the PCs constructed from simulations and data, we find good agree- ment for all components. The distributions
of the eigencoefficients also show an appreciable overlap. We are therefore able to properly simulate
the LRG sample taking into account the SDSS/BOSS instrumental responses. The differences between
the two samples can be ascribed to the intrinsic properties of the simulated galaxy population,
which can be reduced by further improvements of our modelling method in the future. We discuss how
these results can be useful for the forward modeling of upcoming large spectroscopic surveys.
