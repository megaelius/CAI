Giant radio galaxies (GRGs) are physically large radio sources that extend well beyond their host
galaxy environment. Their polarization properties are affected by the poorly constrained magnetic
field that permeates the intergalactic medium on Mpc scales. A low frequency ($<$ 200 MHz) polarization
study of this class of radio sources is now possible with LOFAR. Here we investigate the polarization
properties and Faraday rotation measure (RM) of a catalog of GRGs detected in the LoTSS. This is the
first low-frequency polarization study of a large sample of radio galaxies selected on their physical
size. We explore the magneto-ionic properties of their under-dense environment and probe intergalactic
magnetic fields using the Faraday rotation properties of their radio lobes. We use RM synthesis
in the 120-168 MHz band to search for polarized emission and to derive the RM and fractional polarization
of each detected source component. We study the depolarization between 1.4 GHz and 144 MHz using
images from the NVSS. From a sample of 240 GRGs, we detected 37 sources in polarization, all with a
total flux density above 56 mJy. The fractional polarization of the detected GRGs at 1.4 GHz and 144
MHz is consistent with a small amount of Faraday depolarization (a Faraday dispersion $<$ 0.3 rad
m$^{-2}$). Our analysis shows that the lobes are expanding into a low-density ($<10^{-5}$ cm$^{-3}$)
local environment permeated by weak magnetic fields ($<$0.1 $\mu$G) with fluctuations on scales
of 3 to 25 kpc. The presence of foreground galaxy clusters appears to influence the polarization
detection rate up to 2R$_{500}$. In general, this work demonstrates the ability of LOFAR to quantify
the rarefied environments in which these GRGs exist and highlights them as an excellent statistical
sample to use as high precision probes of magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium and the Milky
Way.
