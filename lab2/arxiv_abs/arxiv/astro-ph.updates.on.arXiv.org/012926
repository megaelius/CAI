We present a catalog of 99,203 wide binary systems, initially identified as common proper motion
(CPM) pairs from a subset of ~5.2 million stars with proper motions $\mu > 40$ mas/year, selected
from Gaia data release 2 (DR2) and the SUPERBLINK high proper motion catalog. CPM pairs are found
by searching for pairs of stars with angular separations $< 1$ degree and proper motion differences
$\Delta\mu < 40$ mas/year. A Bayesian analysis is then applied in two steps. In a first pass, we use
proper motion differences and angular separations to distinguish between binaries and chance
alignments. In a second pass, we use parallax data from Gaia DR2 to refine our Bayesian probability
estimates. We present a table of 119,390 pairs which went through the full analysis, 99,203 of which
have probabilities $>95\%$ of being real binaries. Of those 99,203 high probability pairs, we estimate
that only about 364 pairs are most likely to be false positives. In addition, we identify 57,506 pairs
which have probabilities $>10\%$ from the first pass but have high parallax errors and therefore
were not vetted in the second pass. We examine the projected physical separation distribution of
our highest probability pairs and note that the distribution is a simple exponential tail and shows
no evidence of being bi-modal. Among pairs with lower probability, wide binaries are detected at
larger separations ($>10^{4-5}$ AU) consistent with the very wide population suggested in previous
studies, however our analysis suggests that these do not represent a distinct population. We examine
the HR diagram of this set of high probability wide binaries and find evidence for 980 over-luminous
components among 2,227 K+K wide binaries; assuming these represent unresolved sub-systems, we
determine that the higher order multiplicity fraction for K+K wide systems is at least 39.6\%.
