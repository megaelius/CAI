We measure cosmic weak lensing shear power spectra with the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey
first-year shear catalog covering 137deg$^2$ of the sky. Thanks to the high effective galaxy number
density of 16.5 arcmin$^{-2}$ even after conservative cuts such as magnitude cut of $i<24.5$ and
photometric redshift cut of $0.3\leq z \leq 1.5$, we obtain a high significance measurement of the
cosmic shear power spectra in 4 tomographic redshift bins, achieving a total signal-to-noise ratio
of 16 in the multipole range $300 \leq \ell \leq 1900$. We carefully account for various uncertainties
in our analysis including the intrinsic alignment of galaxies, scatters and biases in photometric
redshifts, residual uncertainties in the shear measurement, and modeling of the matter power spectrum.
The accuracy of our power spectrum measurement method as well as our analytic model of the covariance
matrix are tested against realistic mock shear catalogs. For a flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM)
model, we find $S_8\equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^\alpha=0.800^{+0.029}_{-0.028}$
for $\alpha=0.45$ ($S_8=0.780^{+0.030}_{-0.033}$ for $\alpha=0.5$) from our HSC tomographic
cosmic shear analysis alone. In comparison with Planck cosmic microwave background constraints,
our results prefer slightly lower values of $S_8$, although metrics such as the Bayesian evidence
ratio test do not show significant evidence for discordance between these results. We study the
effect of possible additional systematic errors that are unaccounted in our fiducial cosmic shear
analysis, and find that they can shift the best-fit values of $S_8$ by up to $\sim 0.6\sigma$. The
full HSC survey data will contain several times more area, and will lead to significantly improved
cosmological constraints.
