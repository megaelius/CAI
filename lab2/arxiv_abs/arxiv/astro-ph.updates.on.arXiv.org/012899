Studies measuring the chemical abundances of the neutral gas in star-forming galaxies (SFGs) require
ionization correction factors (ICFs) to accurately measure their metal contents. In the work presented
here we calculate newly improved ICFs for a sample of SFGs. These new corrections include both the
contaminating ionized gas along the line of sight (ICF$_{\rm ionized}$) and unaccounted higher
ionization stages in the neutral gas (ICF$_{\rm neutral}$). We make use of recently acquired spectroscopic
observations taken with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on board Hubble to measure column
densities for Fe II and Fe III. Using the Fe III/Fe II ratios as well as other physical properties (i.e.
$\log$[L$_{\rm UV}$], $N$(H I), T, and $Z$) we generate ad-hoc photoionization models with CLOUDY
to quantify the corrections required for each of the targets. We identify a luminosity threshold
of $\log$[L$_{\rm UV}$]$\sim$ 40.75 erg s$^{-1}$ above which the ICF$_{\rm neutral}$ values for
nitrogen are relatively higher (ICF$_{\rm neutral}=0.05$-0.7) than those for the rest of the elements
(ICF$_{\rm neutral}\sim 0.01$). This behavior indicates that for the high UV luminosity objects,
N II is found in non-negligible quantities in the neutral gas, making these ICF$_{\rm neutral}$
corrections critical for determining the true abundances in the interstellar medium. In addition,
we calculate ICFs from a uniform grid of models covering a wide range of physical properties typically
observed in studies of SFGs and extragalactic H II regions. We provide the community with tabulated
ICF values for the neutral gas abundances measured from a variety of environments and applicable
to chemical studies of the high redshift universe.
