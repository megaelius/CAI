Context. Solar Rossby waves (r modes) have recently been discovered in the near-surface horizontal
flow field using the techniques of granulation-tracking and ring-diagram analysis applied to
six years of SDO/HMI data. Aims. Here we apply time-distance helioseismology to the combined SOHO/MDI
and SDO/HMI data sets, which cover 21 years of observations from May 1996 to April 2017. The goal of
this study is to provide an independent confirmation over two solar cycles and in deeper layers of
the Sun. Methods. We have measured south-north helioseismic travel times along the equator, which
are sensitive to subsurface north-south flows. To reduce noise, the travel times were averaged
over travel distances from 6$^\circ$ to 30$^\circ$; the mean distance corresponds to a p-mode lower
turning point of 0.91 $R_\odot$. The 21-year time series of travel-time measurements was split
into three seven-year subsets and transformed to obtain power spectra in a corotating frame. Results.
The power spectra all show peaks near the frequencies of the classical sectoral Rossby waves for
azimuthal wavenumbers in the range $3 \leq m \leq 15$. The mode frequencies and linewidths of the
modes with $m \leq 9$ are consistent with a previous study whereas modes with $m \geq 10$ are shifted
toward less negative frequencies by 10--20 nHz. While most of these modes have e-folding lifetimes
on the order of a few months, the longest lived mode, $m=3$, has an e-folding lifetime of more than
one year. For each mode, the rms velocity at the equator is in the range of 1--3 m s$^{-1}$ , with the
largest values for $m\sim10$. No evidence for the $m=2$ sectoral mode is found in the power spectrum,
implying that the rms velocity of this mode is below $\sim$0.5 m s$^{-1}$.
