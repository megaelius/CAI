Recent results have suggested that active galactic nuclei (AGN) could provide enough photons to
reionise the Universe. We assess the viability of this scenario using a semi-numerical framework
for modeling reionisation, to which we add a quasar contribution by constructing a Quasar Halo Occupation
Distribution (QHOD) based on Giallongo et al. observations. Assuming a constant QHOD, we find that
an AGN-only model cannot simultaneously match observations of the optical depth $\tau_e$, neutral
fraction, and ionising emissivity. Such a model predicts $\tau_e$ too low by $\sim 2\sigma$ relative
to Planck constraints, and reionises the Universe at $z\lesssim 5$. Arbitrarily increasing the
AGN emissivity to match these results yields a strong mismatch with the observed ionising emissivity
at $z\sim 5$. If we instead assume a redshift-independent AGN luminosity function yielding an emissivity
evolution like that assumed in Madau & Haardt model, then we can match $\tau_e$ albeit with late reionisation,
however such evolution is inconsistent with observations at $z\sim 4-6$ and poorly motivated physically.
These results arise because AGN are more biased towards massive halos than typical reionising galaxies,
resulting in stronger clustering and later formation times. AGN-dominated models produce larger
ionising bubbles that are reflected in $\sim\times 2$ more 21cm power on all scales. A model with
equal parts galaxies and AGN contribution is still (barely) consistent with observations, but
could be distinguished using next-generation 21cm experiments HERA and SKA-low. We conclude that,
even with recent claims of more faint AGN than previously thought, AGN are highly unlikely to dominate
the ionising photon budget for reionisation.
