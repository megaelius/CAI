When analyzing galaxy clustering in multi-band imaging surveys, there is a trade-off between selecting
the largest galaxy samples (to minimize the shot noise) and selecting samples with the best photometric
redshift (photo-z) precision, which generally include only a small subset of galaxies. In this
paper, we systematically explore this trade-off. Our analysis is targeted towards the third year
data of the Dark Energy Survey (DES), but our methods hold generally for other data sets. Using a simple
Gaussian model for the redshift uncertainties, we carry out a Fisher matrix forecast for cosmological
constraints from angular clustering in the redshift range $z = 0.2-0.95$. We quantify the cosmological
constraints using a Figure of Merit (FoM) that measures the combined constraints on $\Omega_m$
and $\sigma_8$ in the context of $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that the trade-off between sample
size and photo-z precision is sensitive to 1) whether cross-correlations between redshift bins
are included or not, and 2) the ratio of the redshift bin width $\delta z$ and the photo-z precision
$\sigma_z$. When cross-correlations are included and the redshift bin width is allowed to vary,
the highest FoM is achieved when $\delta z \sim \sigma_z$. We find that for the typical case of $5-10$
redshift bins, optimal results are reached when we use larger, less precise photo-z samples, provided
that we include cross-correlations. For samples with higher $\sigma_{z}$, the overlap between
redshift bins is larger, leading to higher cross-correlation amplitudes. This leads to the self-calibration
of the photo-z parameters and therefore tighter cosmological constraints. These results can be
used to help guide galaxy sample selection for clustering analysis in ongoing and future photometric
surveys.
