We suggest that fast-rising blue optical transients (FBOTs), and the brightest event of the class
AT2018cow, result from electron-capture collapse following a merger of a massive ONeMg white dwarf
(WD) with another WD. Two distinct evolutionary channels lead to the disruption of the less massive
WD during the merger and formation of a shell burning non-degenerate star. During the shell burning
stage a large fraction of the envelope is lost to the wind, while mass and angular momentum are added
to the core. As a result, the electron-capture collapse occurs with a small envelope mass, after
$\sim 10^2-10^4$ years. During the formation of a neutron star (NS) as little as $\sim 10^{-2} M_\odot
$ of the material is ejected at the bounce-off with mildly relativistic velocities and total energy
$\sim$ few $ 10^{50}$ ergs. This ejecta becomes optically thin on time scales of days - this is the
FBOT. During the collapse the NS is spun up and magnetic field is amplified. The ensuing fast magnetically-dominated
relativistic wind from the newly formed NS shocks against the ejecta, and later against the wind.
The radiation-dominated forward shock produces the long-lasting optical afterglow, while the
termination shock of the relativistic wind produces the high energy emission in a Pulsar Wind Nebulae-like
manner. If the secondary WD was of the DA type - the most frequent - the wind will have hydrogen, of the
order of $10^{-4} M_\odot$: this explains appearance of hydrogen late in the afterglow spectrum.
The model explains many of the puzzling properties of FBOTs/AT2018cow: host galaxies, fast and
light anisotropic ejecta producing bright optical peak, afterglow with high energy emission of
similar luminosity to optical, hard X-ray and infra-red features, presence of dense wind environment,
late powerful radio emission.
