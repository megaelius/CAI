The exploration of the spatial distribution of chemical abundances in star-forming regions in
galactic discs provides clues to understand the complex interplay of physical processes that regulate
the star formation activity and the chemical enrichment across a galaxy. We study the azimuthal
variations of the normalized oxygen abundance profiles in the highest numerical resolution run
of the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) Project at $z=0$. We use
young stellar populations to trace the abundances of star-forming regions. Oxygen profiles are
estimated along different line of sights from a centrally located observer.The mean azimuthal
variation in the EAGLE discs are $\sim 0.12 \pm 0.03$~dex~$R_{\rm eff}^{-1}$ for slopes and $\sim
0.12 \pm 0.03$~dex for the zero points, in agreement with previous works. Metallicity gradients
measured along random directions correlate with those determine by averaging over the whole discs
although with a large dispersion. We find a slight trend for higher azimuthal variations in the disc
components of low star-forming and bulge-dominated galaxies. We also investigate the metallicity
profiles of stellar populations with higher and lower levels of enrichment than the average metallicity
profiles, and we find that high star-forming region with high metallicity tend to have slightly
shallower metallicity slopes compared with the overall metallicity gradient. The simulated azimuthal
variations in the EAGLE discs are in global agreement with observations, although the large variety
of metallicity gradients would encourage further exploration of the metal mixing in numerical
simulations.
