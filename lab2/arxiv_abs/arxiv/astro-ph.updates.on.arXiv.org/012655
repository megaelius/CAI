The largest uncertainty on measurements of dark energy using type Ia supernovae is presently due
to systematics from photometry; specifically to the relative uncertainty on photometry as a function
of wavelength in the optical spectrum. We show that a precise constraint on relative photometry
between the visible and near-infrared can be achieved at upcoming survey telescopes (such as at
the Vera Rubin Observatory [VRO]) via a mountaintop-located laser source tuned to the 342.78 nm
vacuum excitation wavelength of neutral sodium atoms. Using a high-power (500 W) laser modified
from laser guide star studies, this excitation will produce an artificial star (which we term a "laser
photometric ratio star," or LPRS) of de-excitation light in the mesosphere that is observable from
the ground at approximately 20 magnitude (i.e., well within the expected single-image magnitude
limit of VRO) at wavelengths in vacuum of 589.16 nm, 589.76 nm, 818.55 nm, and 819.70 nm, with the sum
of the numbers of 589.16 nm and 589.76 nm photons produced by this process equal to the sum of the numbers
of 818.55 nm and 819.70 nm photons, establishing a precise calibration ratio between, for example,
the VRO r and z filters. This technique can thus provide a novel mechanism for establishing a spectrophotometric
calibration ratio of unprecedented precision, from above most of the Earth's atmosphere, for upcoming
telescopic observations across astronomy and atmospheric physics. This article is the first in
a pair of articles on this topic. The second article of the pair describes an alternative technique
to achieve a similar, but brighter, LPRS than the technique described in this paper, by using two
mountaintop-located lasers, at optical frequencies approximately 4 GHz away from resonances
at wavelengths in vacuum of 589.16 nm and 819.71 nm respectively.
