The existence of fast moving, cold gas ubiquitously observed in galactic winds is theoretically
puzzling, since the destruction time of cold gas is much smaller than its acceleration time. In Gronke
& Oh (2018), we showed that cold gas can accelerate to wind speeds and grow in mass if the radiative
cooling time of mixed gas is shorter than the cloud destruction time. Here, we study this process
in much more detail, and find remarkably robust cloud acceleration and growth in a wide variety of
scenarios. Radiative cooling, rather than the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, enables self-sustaining
entrainment of hot gas onto the cloud via cooling-induced pressure gradients. Indeed, growth peaks
when the cloud is almost co-moving. The entrainment velocity is of order the cold gas sound speed,
and growth is accompanied by cloud pulsations. Growth is also robust to the background wind and initial
cloud geometry. In an adiabatic Chevalier-Clegg type wind, for instance, the mass growth rate is
constant. Although growth rates are similar with magnetic fields, cloud morphology changes dramatically,
with low density, magnetically supported filaments which have a small mass fraction but dominate
by volume. This could bias absorption line observations. Cloud growth from entraining and cooling
hot gas can potentially account for the cold gas content of the CGM. It can also fuel star formation
in the disk as cold gas recycled in a galactic fountain accretes and cools halo gas. We speculate that
galaxy-scale simulations should converge in cold gas mass once cloud column densities of ${\rm
N} \sim 10^{18} \ {\rm cm^{-2}}$ are resolved.
