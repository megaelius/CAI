We investigate the evolution of the star formation rate$-$stellar mass relation (SFR$-{\rm M}_{\star}$)
and Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) of $z\sim 4-7 $ galaxies, using cosmological simulations
run with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code P-GADGET3(XXL). We explore the effects of different
feedback prescriptions (supernova driven galactic winds and AGN feedback), initial stellar mass
functions and metal cooling. We show that our fiducial model, with strong energy-driven winds and
early AGN feedback, is able to reproduce the observed stellar mass function obtained from UV-selected
samples of galaxies at redshift $6\le z\le7$. At $z\sim4$ our simulations are more consistent with
recent results from IR-selected samples, which provide a better proxy of stellar masses. Despite
this success, there is a tension between simulated and observed (UV) SFR$-{\rm M}_{\star}$ relations
that leads to a disagreement between the GSMF recovered from simulations and UV observations. By
combining the simulated SFR(M$_{\star}$) relationship with the observed star formation rate
function at a given redshift, we argue that this disagreement may be the result of the uncertainty
in the observed $L_{\rm UV}-{\rm M}_{\star}$ conversion and in the normalization of the observed
SFR$-{\rm M}_{\star}$ relation. Our simulations predict a population of faint galaxies not seen
by current observations. We find that there is an inconsistency between the observed SFR$-{\rm
M}_{\star}$ relations based on galaxies selected in the IR and UV at redshift $z \sim 4-5$. The main
reason for this tension is that high redshift surveys assume different dust corrections to recover
SFRs. Our simulated SFR(M$_{\star}$) is more consistent with IR-selected samples of galaxies
at all the redshifts considered.
