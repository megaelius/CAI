We calculate the star formation quenching timescales in green valley galaxies at intermediate
redshifts ($z\sim0.5-1$) using stacked zCOSMOS spectra of different galaxy morphological types:
spheroidal, disk-like, irregular and merger, dividing disk-like galaxies further into unbarred,
weakly-barred and strongly-barred, assuming a simple exponentially-decaying star formation
history model and based on the H$_{\delta}$ absorption feature and the $4000$ \AA ~break. We find
that different morphological types present different star formation quenching timescales, reinforcing
the idea that the galaxy morphology is strongly correlated with the physical processes responsible
for quenching star formation. Our quantification of the star formation quenching timescale indicates
that disks have typical timescales $60\%$ to 5 times longer than that of galaxies presenting spheroidal,
irregular or merger morphologies. Barred galaxies in particular present the slowest transition
timescales through the green valley. This suggests that although secular evolution may ultimately
lead to gas exhaustion in the host galaxy via bar-induced gas inflows that trigger star formation
activity, secular agents are not major contributors in the rapid quenching of galaxies at these
redshifts. Galaxy interaction, associated with the elliptical, irregular and merger morphologies
contribute, to a more significant degree, to the fast transition through the green valley at these
redshifts. In the light of previous works suggesting that both secular and merger processes are
responsible for the star formation quenching at low redshifts, our results provide an explanation
to the recent findings that star formation quenching happened at a faster pace at $z\sim0.8$.
