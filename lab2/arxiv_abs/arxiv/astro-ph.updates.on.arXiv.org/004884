We present continued radio and X-ray observations of the relativistic tidal disruption event Swift
J164449.3+573451 extending to $\delta t \approx 2000$ d after discovery. The radio data were obtained
with the VLA as part of a long-term program to monitor the energy and dynamical evolution of the relativistic
jet and to characterize the parsec-scale environment around a previously dormant supermassive
black hole. We combine these data with $\textit{Chandra}$ X-ray observations and demonstrate
that the X-ray emission following the sharp decline at $\delta t \approx 500$ d is due to the forward
shock. Using the X-ray data, in conjunction with optical/NIR data, we constrain the synchrotron
cooling frequency and the microphysical properties of the outflow for the first time. We find that
the cooling frequency evolves through the optical/NIR band at $\delta t \approx 10 - 200$ d, corresponding
to a magnetic field energy density fraction of $\epsilon_B \approx 10^{-3}$, well below equipartition;
the X-ray data demonstrate that this deviation from equipartition holds to at least $\delta t \approx
2000$ d. We thus recalculate the physical properties of the jet over the lifetime of the event, no
longer assuming equipartition. We find a total kinetic energy of $E_K \approx 4 \times 10^{51}$
erg and a transition to non-relativistic expansion on the timescale of our latest observations
($\delta t \approx 700$ d). The density profile is approximately $R^{-3/2}$ at $\lesssim 0.3$ pc
and $\gtrsim 0.7$ pc, with a plateau at intermediate scales, characteristic of Bondi accretion.
Based on its evolution thus far, we predict that Sw 1644+57 will be detectable at centimeter wavelengths
for decades to centuries with existing and upcoming radio facilities. Similar off-axis events
should be detectable to $z \sim 2$, but with a slow evolution that may inhibit their recognition as
transient events.
