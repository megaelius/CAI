For more than 5000 stars with accurate parallaxes from the Hipparcos and Gaia DR1 Tycho-Gaia astrometric
solution (TGAS), Tycho-2 photometry, interstellar polarization from eight catalogues and interstellar
extinction from eight 3D maps the largest up to date comparison of the polarization and extinction
is provided. The extinction maps give different estimations of the extinction and of the polarization
efficiency as the polarization divided into extinction $P/A_V$ as well as of the percentage of the
stars with the polarization efficiency higher than the limit of Serkowski $P/A_V>0.03$. Using
the Hipparcos parallaxes we found about 200 stars (4\%, mainly OB stars) drop higher than the limit
when we use any extinction map. However, the usage of more accurate TGAS parallaxes decreases them
to only 17 stars (0.3\%). The polarization and extinction are negligible inside the Local Bubble
within 80 pc from the Sun. In the vast Bubble's shell at the distances 80--118 pc from the Sun the polarization
and extinction rapidly grow with the distance whereas the position angle of the polarization is
oriented predominantly along the shell of the Bubble. Outside the Bubble the polarization and extinction
grow with the distance slowly. In addition, within a radius of 80--300 pc of the Sun a disc of some filamentary
dust clouds (including well-known Markkanen cloud) is observed as in the polarization map as in
the reddening one by Schlegel et al. In this disc the position angle of polarization is preferably
oriented along the plane of the disk. For the regions further than 300 pc the position angle of polarization
is preferably oriented along the Local spiral arm, i.e. Y coordinate axis. The polarization and
its efficiency is lower in the dust layer in the Gould belt than in the equatorial dust layer. It may
means different properties of dust in these two layers.
