The interaction between the magnetic fields of late-type stars and their close-by planets may produce
stellar flares as observed in active binary systems. However, in spite of several claims, conclusive
evidence is still lacking. We estimate the magnetic energy available in the interaction using analytical
models to provide an upper bound to the expected flare energy. We investigate three different mechanisms
leading to magnetic energy release. The first two can release an energy up to $(0.2-1.2) B^{2}_{0}
R^{3}/\mu$, where $B_{0}$ is the surface field of the star, $R$ its radius, and $\mu$ the magnetic
permeability of the plasma. They operate in young active stars whose coronae have closed magnetic
field lines up to the distance of their close-by planets that can trigger the energy release. The
third mechanism operates in weakly or moderately active stars having a coronal field with predominantly
open field lines at the distance of their planets. The released energy is of the order of $(0.002-0.1)
B^{2}_{0} R^{3}/\mu$ and depends on the ratio of the planetary to the stellar fields, thus allowing
an indirect measurement of the former when the latter is known. We compute the released energy for
different separations of the planet and different stellar parameters finding the conditions for
the operation of the proposed mechanisms. An application to eight selected systems is presented.
The computed energies and dissipation timescales are in agreement with flare observations in the
eccentric system HD 17156 and in the circular systems HD 189733 and HD 179949. This kind of star-planet
interaction can be unambiguously identified by the higher flaring frequency expected close to
periastron in eccentric systems.
