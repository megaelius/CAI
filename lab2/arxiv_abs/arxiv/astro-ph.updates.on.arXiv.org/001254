(Abridged) We investigate the morphology dependence of the Tully-Fisher relation, and the expansion
of the relation into a three-dimensional manifold defined by luminosity, total circular velocity
and a third dynamical parameter, to fully characterise spiral galaxies across all morphological
types. We use a semi-analytic hierarchical model of galaxy evolution to build the theoretical TF
relation. With this tool, we analyse a unique dataset of galaxies for which we cross-match luminosity
with total circular velocity and central velocity dispersion. We provide a theoretical framework
to calculate such measurable quantities from semi-analytic models. We establish the morphology
dependence of the TF relation in both model and data. We analyse the dynamical properties of the model
galaxies and determine that the parameter 'sigma/Vc', i.e. the ratio between random and total motions
defined by velocity dispersion and circular velocity, accurately characterises the varying slope
of the TF relation for different model galaxy types. We apply these dynamical cuts to the observed
galaxies and find that such selection produces a differential slope of the TF relation. The TF slope
in different ranges of 'sigma/Vc' is consistent with that for the photometric classification in
Sa, Sb, Sc. We conclude that 'sigma/Vc' is a good parameter to classify galaxy type, and we argue that
such classification based on dynamics more closely mirrors the physical properties of the observed
galaxies, compared to visual classification. We also argue that dynamical classification is useful
for samples where eye inspection is not reliable or impractical. We conclude that 'sigma/Vc' is
a suitable parameter to characterise the hierarchical assembly history that determines the disk-to-bulge
ratio, and to expand the TF relation into a three-dimensional manifold, defined by luminosity,
circular velocity and 'sigma/Vc'.
