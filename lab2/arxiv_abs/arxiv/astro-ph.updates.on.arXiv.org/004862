We present a comprehensive study of the abundance evolution of the elements from H to U in the Milky
Way halo and local disk. We use a consistent chemical evolution model, metallicity dependent isotopic
yields from low and intermediate mass stars and yields from massive stars which include, for the
first time, the combined effect of metallicity, mass loss and rotation for a large grid of stellar
masses and for all stages of stellar evolution. The yields of massive stars are weighted by a metallicity
dependent function of the rotational velocities, constrained by observations as to obtain a primary-like
$^{14}$N behavior at low metallicity and to avoid overproduction of s-elements at intermediate
metallicities. We show that the solar system isotopic composition can be reproduced to better than
a factor of two for isotopes up to the Fe-peak, and at the 10\% level for most pure s-isotopes, both
light ones (resulting from the weak s-process in rotating massive stars) and the heavy ones (resulting
from the main s-process in low and intermediate mass stars). We conclude that the light element primary
process (LEPP), invoked to explain the apparent abundance deficiency of the s-elements with A<
100, is not necessary. We also reproduce the evolution of the heavy to light s-elements abundance
ratio ([hs/ls]) - recently observed in unevolved thin disk stars - as a result of the contribution
of rotating massive stars at sub-solar metallicities. We find that those stars produce primary
F and dominate its solar abundance and we confirm their role in the observed primary behavior of N.
In contrast, we show that their action is insufficient to explain the small observed values of C12/C13
in halo red giants, which is rather due to internal processes in those stars.
