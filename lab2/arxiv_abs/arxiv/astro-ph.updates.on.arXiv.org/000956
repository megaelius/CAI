We present new lightcurve measurements of Comet 10P/Tempel 2 carried out with Lowell Observatory's
Discovery Channel Telescope in early 2013 when the comet was at aphelion. These data represent some
of the first science obtained with this new 4.3-m facility. With Tempel 2 having been observed to
exhibit a small but ongoing spin-down in its rotation period for over two decades, our primary goals
at this time were two-fold. First, to determine its current rotation period and compare it to that
measured shortly after its most recent perihelion passage in 2010, and second, to disentangle the
spin-down from synodic effects due to the solar day and the Earth's orbital motion and to determine
the sense of rotation, i.e. prograde or retrograde. At our midpoint of 2013 Feb 24, the observed synodic
period is 8.948+/-0.001 hr, exactly matching the predicted prograde rotation solution based on
2010 results, and yields a sidereal period of the identical value due to the solar and Earth synodic
components just canceling out during the interval of the 2013 observations. The retrograde solution
is ruled out because the associated sidereal periods in 2010 and 2013 are quite different even though
we know that extremely little outgassing, needed to produce torques, occurred in this interval.
With a definitive sense of rotation, the specific amounts of spin-down to the sidereal period could
be assessed. The nominal values imply that the rate of spin-down has decreased over time, consistent
with the secular drop in water production since 1988. Our data also exhibited an unexpectedly small
lightcurve amplitude which appears to be associated with viewing from a large, negative sub-Earth
latitude, and a lightcurve shape deviating from a simple sinusoid implying a highly irregularly
shaped nucleus.
