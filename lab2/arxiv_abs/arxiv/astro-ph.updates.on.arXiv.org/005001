The mass of galaxy clusters is not a direct observable, nonetheless it is commonly used to probe cosmological
models. Based on the combination of all main cluster observables, that is, the X-ray emission, the
thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signal, the velocity dispersion of the cluster galaxies, and
gravitational lensing, the gravitational potential of galaxy clusters can be jointly reconstructed.
We derive the two main ingredients required for this joint reconstruction: the potentials individually
reconstructed from the observables and their covariance matrices, which act as a weight in the joint
reconstruction. We show here the method to derive these quantities. The result of the joint reconstruction
applied to a real cluster will be discussed in a forthcoming paper. We apply the Richardson-Lucy
deprojection algorithm to data on a two-dimensional (2D) grid. We first test the 2D deprojection
algorithm on a $\beta$-profile. Assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, we further reconstruct the
gravitational potential of a simulated galaxy cluster based on synthetic SZ and X-ray data. We then
reconstruct the projected gravitational potential of the massive and dynamically active cluster
Abell 2142, based on the X-ray observations collected with XMM-Newton and the SZ observations from
the Planck satellite. Finally, we compute the covariance matrix of the projected reconstructed
potential of the cluster Abell 2142 based on the X-ray measurements collected with XMM-Newton.
The gravitational potentials of the simulated cluster recovered from synthetic X-ray and SZ data
are consistent, even though the potential reconstructed from X-rays shows larger deviations from
the true potential. Regarding Abell 2142, the projected gravitational cluster potentials recovered
from SZ and X-ray data reproduce well the projected potential inferred from gravitational-lensing
observations. (abridged)
