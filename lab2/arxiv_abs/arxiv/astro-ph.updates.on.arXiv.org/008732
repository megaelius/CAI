Asteroid (7) Iris is an ideal target for disk-resolved imaging owing to its brightness (V$\sim$7-8)
and large angular size of 0.33 arcsec during its apparitions. Iris is believed to belong to the category
of large unfragmented asteroids that avoided internal differentiation, implying that its current
shape and topography may record the first few 100 Myr of the solar system's collisional evolution.
We recovered information about the shape and surface topography of Iris from disk-resolved VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL
images acquired in the frame of our ESO large program. We used the All-Data Asteroid Modeling (ADAM)
shape reconstruction algorithm to model the 3D shape of Iris, using optical disk-integrated data
and disk-resolved images from SPHERE as inputs. We analyzed the SPHERE images to infer the asteroid's
global shape and the morphology of its main craters. We present the volume-equivalent diameter
D$_{{\rm eq}}$=214$\pm$5 km, and bulk density $\rho$=2.7$\pm$0.3 g cm$^{-3}$ of Iris. Its shape
appears to be consistent with that of an oblate spheroid with a large equatorial excavation. We identified
eight putative surface features 20--40 km in diameter detected at several epochs, which we interpret
as impact craters. Craters on Iris have depth-to-diameter ratios that are similar to those of analogous
10 km craters on Vesta. The bulk density of Iris is consistent with that of its meteoritic analog,
namely LL ordinary chondrites. Considering the absence of a collisional family related to Iris
and the number of large craters on its surface, we suggest that its equatorial depression may be the
remnant of an ancient (at least 3 Gyr) impact. Iris's shape further opens the possibility that large
planetesimals formed as almost perfect oblate spheroids. Finally, we attribute the difference
in crater morphology between Iris and Vesta to their different surface gravities.
