Based on new observations and improved modeling techniques, we have reanalyzed seven Cepheids
in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Improved physical parameters have been determined for the exotic
system OGLE LMC-CEP-1718 composed of two first-overtone Cepheids and a completely new model was
obtained for the OGLE LMC-CEP-1812 classical Cepheid. This is now the shortest period Cepheid for
which the projection factor is measured. The typical accuracy of our dynamical masses and radii
determinations is 1%. The radii of the six classical Cepheids follow period--radius relations
in the literature. Our very accurate physical parameter measurements allow us to calculate a purely
empirical, tight period--mass--radius relation that agrees well with theoretical relations
derived from non-canonical models. This empirical relation is a powerful tool to calculate accurate
masses for single Cepheids for which precise radii can be obtained from Baade--Wesselink-type
analyses. The mass of the type-II Cepheid $\kappa$ Pav, $0.56 \pm 0.08 M_\odot$, determined using
this relation is in a very good agreement with theoretical predictions. We find large differences
between the p-factor values derived for the Cepheids in our sample. Evidence is presented that a
simple period--p-factor relation shows an intrinsic dispersion, hinting at the relevance of other
parameters, such as the masses, radii, and radial velocity variation amplitudes. We also find evidence
that the systematic blueshift exhibited by Cepheids, is primarily correlated with their gravity.
The companion star of the Cepheid in the OGLE LMC-CEP-4506 system has a very similar temperature
and luminosity, and is clearly located inside the Cepheid instability strip, yet it is not pulsating.
