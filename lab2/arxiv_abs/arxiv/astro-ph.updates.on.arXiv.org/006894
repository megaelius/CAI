The formation and orbital evolution of Saturn's inner mid-sized moons are still debated. The most
puzzling aspects are 1) how the Tethys-Dione pair and the Mimas-Enceladus pair passed through their
strong 3:2 mean-motion resonances during the tidal orbital evolution, and 2) the current strong
heat flow from Enceladus, which is a few orders of magnitude higher than the tidal energy dissipation
caused by the present orbital eccentricity of Enceladus. Here we perform N-body simulations of
the moons' orbital evolution from various initial conditions -- assuming that the moons were formed
from Saturn's hypothetical massive ring -- and investigate possible paths to solve the above difficulties.
If the influence of the rings is neglected, we find that the Tethys-Dione pair cannot avoid becoming
trapped in the mean-motion resonances as they recede from Saturn, and that the Tethys-Enceladus
pair cannot avoid collisions after the resonance trapping, in case Saturn's quality factor is smaller
than 15,000. These findings are inconsistent with the current orbital configuration. However,
taking into account both the eccentricity excitation and the orbital expansion caused by the ring
torque, we find that these resonance captures are avoided. With the high eccentricity pumped up
by the torque, Enceladus passes through the resonances with Tethys, and the Dione-Tethys pair passes
through their 2:1 and possibly the 3:2 resonance as well. After Enceladus resides beyond the 2:1
resonance with the outer ring edge, the eccentricity can be tidally damped. While this is a promising
path of evolution, in most runs, Enceladus collides with Tethys by the excited eccentricity. There
is a hint that a ring mass decrease could avoid the collision. The tidal heat due to the eccentricity
excitation by the ring torque is stored in the moons and slowly radiated away. It may account for the
current high heat flow.
