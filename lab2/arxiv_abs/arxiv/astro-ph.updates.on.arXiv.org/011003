Previous work has introduced scale-split energy density \psi for a given vector field B in order
to quantify the field stochasticity S(t). Application to turbulent magnetic fields leads to the
prediction that tangling magnetic field by turbulence increases magnetic stochasticity. An increasing
stochasticity in turn leads to disalignments of the coarse-grained fields at smaller scales thus
they average to weaker fields at larger scales upon coarse-graining. The field's resistance against
tanglement by the turbulence may lead at some point to its sudden slippage through the fluid, decreasing
the stochasticity and increasing the energy density. Thus the maxima (minima) of magnetic stochasticity
are expected to approximately coincide with the minima (maxima) of energy density, occurrence
of which corresponds to slippage of the magnetic field through the fluid. Field-fluid slippage,
on the other hand, has been already found to be intimately related to magnetic reconnection. In this
paper, we test these theoretical predictions numerically using a homogeneous, incompressible
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. Apart from expected small scale deviations, possibly
due to e.g., intermittency and strong field annihilation, the theoretically predicted global
relationship between stochasticity and magnetic energy is observed in different sub-volumes
of the simulation box. This may indicate ubiquitous local field-fluid slippage and small scale
reconnection events in MHD turbulence. We also show that the maximum magnetic stochasticity, i.e.,
\partial_t S(t)=0 & \partial^2_t S(t)<0, leads to sudden increases in kinetic stochasticity level
which may correspond to fluid jets driven by the reconnecting field lines, i.e., reconnection.
This suggests a new mathematical approach to the reconnection problem.
