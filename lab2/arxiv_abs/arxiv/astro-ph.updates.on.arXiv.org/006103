We investigate the compressional modes of cold neutron stars with cores consisting of superfluid
neutrons, superconducting protons and normal fluid electrons and muons, and crusts that contain
superfluid neutrons plus a normal fluid of (spherical) nuclei and electrons. We develop a two-fluid
formalism for the core that accounts for leptonic buoyancy, and an analogous treatment for the crust.
We adopt the Cowling approximation, neglecting gravitational perturbations, but include all
effects of the background space-time. We introduce a phenomenological, easily-modified nuclear
equation of state which contains all of the thermodynamic information required to compute the coupled
fluid oscillations, with parameters that are constrained by nuclear physics and the requirement
that the maximum mass of a neutron star is $\geq 2M_{\odot}$. Using four parametrizations of this
equation of state with nuclear compressibilities $K=230$-$280$ MeV, we calculate the Brunt-V\"{a}is\"{a}l\"{a}
frequency due to leptonic buoyancy, and find the corresponding $g$-mode frequencies and eigenfunctions.
We find that the WKB approximation reproduces $g$-mode frequencies closely. We examine the dependence
of $g$-mode frequencies on stellar mass, nuclear compressibility and strength of neutron-proton
entrainment, and compare to previous calculations of $g$-mode frequencies due to leptonic buoyancy.
We also compute the $p$-mode spectra, confirming previous findings that the two fluids behave as
if uncoupled except the case of large entrainment, and show the existence of nearly resonant mode
pairs which could lead to nonlinear $p$-$g$ instabilities even at zero temperature.
