Assuming a non-gravitational interaction amongst the dark fluids of our universe namely, the dark
matter and dark energy, we study a specific interaction model in the background of a spatially flat
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker geometry. The interaction model, as we found, solves
the background evolution in an analytic way when the dark energy takes a constant barotropic equation
of state, $w_x$. In particular, we analyze two separate interaction scenarios, namely, when the
dark energy is a fluid other than the vacuum energy (i.e., $w_x \neq -1$) and when it is vacuum energy
itself (i.e., $w_x = -1$). We found that the interacting model with $w_x \neq -1$ produces stable
perturbation at large scales for $w_x < -1$ with the coupling strength $\xi<0$. Both the scenarios
have been constrained with the latest astronomical data having distinct origin. The analyses show
that a very small interaction with coupling strength is allowed and within 68.3\% confidence-region,
$\xi =0$ is recovered. The analyses further show that a large coupling strength significantly affects
the large scale dynamics of the universe while according to the observational data the interaction
models are very well consistent with the $\Lambda$-cosmology. Furthermore, we observe that for
the vacuum interaction scenario, the tension on $H_0$ is not released while for the interacting
dark energy scenario with $w_x < -1$, the tension on $H_0$ seems to be released partially because
of the high error bars in $H_0$. Finally, we close the work with the Bayesian evidence which shows
that the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology is favored over the two interacting scenarios.
