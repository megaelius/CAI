Aims: We present a magnetic Doppler imaging study from all Stokes parameters of the cool, chemically
peculiar star HD 24712. This is the very first such analysis performed at a resolving power exceeding
10^5. Methods: The analysis is performed on the basis of phase-resolved observations of line profiles
in all four Stokes parameters obtained with the HARPSpol instrument attached at the 3.6-m ESO telescope.
We use the magnetic Doppler imaging code, INVERS10, which allows us to derive the magnetic field
geometry and surface chemical abundance distributions simultaneously. Results: We report magnetic
maps of HD 24712 recovered from a selection of FeI, FeII, NdIII, and NaI lines with strong polarization
signals in all Stokes parameters. Our magnetic maps successfully reproduce most of the details
available from our observation data. We used these magnetic field maps to produce abundance distribution
map of Ca. This new analysis shows that the surface magnetic field of HD 24712 has a dominant dipolar
component with a weak contribution from higher-order harmonics. The surface abundance distributions
of Fe and Ca show enhancements near the magnetic equator with an underabundant patch at the visible
(positive) magnetic pole; Nd is highly abundant around the positive magnetic pole. The Na abundance
map shows a high overabundance around the negative magnetic pole. Conclusions: Based on our investigation
and similar recent four Stokes parameter magnetic mapping studies, we present a tentative evidence
for the hypothesis that Ap stars with dipole-like fields are older than stars with magnetic fields
that have more small-scale structures. We find that our abundance maps are inconsistent with recent
theoretical calculations of atomic diffusion in presence of magnetic fields.
