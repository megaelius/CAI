We use the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey to measure the local Universe mass dependent merger
fraction and merger rate using galaxy pairs and the CAS structural method, which identifies highly
asymmetric merger candidate galaxies. Our goals are to determine which types of mergers produce
highly asymmetrical galaxies, and to provide a new measurement of the local galaxy major merger
rate. We examine galaxy pairs at stellar mass limits down to $M_{*} = 10^{8}M_{\odot}$ with mass
ratios of $<$100:1 and line of sight velocity differences of $\Delta V<500$ km s$^{-1}$.
We find a significant increase in mean asymmetries for projected separations less than the sum of
the individual galaxy's Petrosian 90 radii. For systems in major merger pairs with mass ratios of
$<$4:1 both galaxies in the pair show a strong increase in asymmetry, while in minor merger systems
(with mass ratios of $>$4:1) the lower mass companion becomes highly asymmetric, while the larger
galaxy is much less affected. The fraction of highly asymmetric paired galaxies which have a major
merger companion is highest for the most massive galaxies and drops progressively with decreasing
mass. We calculate that the mass dependent major merger fraction is fairly constant at $\sim1.3-2\%$
between $10^{9.5}<M_{*}<10^{11.5} M_{\odot}$, and increases to $\sim4\%$ at lower masses.
When the observability time scales are taken into consideration, the major merger rate is found
to approximately triple over the mass range we consider. The total co-moving volume major merger
rate over the range $10^{8.0}<M_{*}<10^{11.5} M_{\odot}$ is $(1.2 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{-3}$
$h^{3}_{70}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ Gyr$^{-1}$.
