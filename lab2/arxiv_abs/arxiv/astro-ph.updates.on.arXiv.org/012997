Neutron-star mergers are associated with violent phenomena that probe physical principles under
extreme conditions that are not reproducible in any terrestrial laboratory. Thus, their multi-messenger
analysis combining gravitational-wave and electromagnetic signatures from multiple wavelengths
is not only of astrophysical interest, but it also allows studying the behavior of supranuclear
dense matter, testing the fabric of spacetime, probing the principles of general relativity, and
measuring the expansion rate of the Universe. In this work, we perform a multi-messenger analysis
of the gravitational wave signal GW170817 and its electromagnetic counterparts AT2017gfo and
GRB170817A. By incorporating information from the NICER observation of PSR J0030+0451, the radio
observations of PSR J0740+6620, and nuclear theory computations using chiral effective field
theory, we provide new constraints on the neutron-star equation of state and the Hubble constant.
For our analysis, we make use of the new waveform approximant IMRPhenomPv2_NRTidalv2 for the interpretation
of the gravitational wave signal, we employ a newly developed kilonova model, and we derive a new
prediction for the debris disk mass surrounding the binary neutron star merger remnant. We determine
the radius of a 1.4 solar mass neutron star to be $R_{1.4M_\odot}=10.98^{+0.37}_{-0.38} \rm km$
at $1\sigma$ uncertainty and $R_{1.4M_\odot}=10.98^{+1.00}_{-0.69} \rm km$ at $2\sigma$ uncertainty.
In addition, we estimate the Hubble constant to be $H_0=68.4^{+5.2}_{-4.7}\ \rm km /Mpc/s$ at $1\sigma$
uncertainty. We test the consistency of our results and the robustness of our methods by also analyzing
the second binary neutron-star merger detection GW190425 and the fact that no electromagnetic
counterpart was observed for this event.
