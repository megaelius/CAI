Correlations between cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature, polarization and spectral
distortion anisotropies can be used as a probe of primordial non-Gaussianity. Here, we perform
a reconstruction of $\mu$-distortion anisotropies in the presence of Galactic and extragalactic
foregrounds, applying the so-called Constrained ILC component separation method to simulations
of proposed CMB space missions (PIXIE, LiteBIRD, CORE, PICO). Our sky simulations include Galactic
dust, Galactic synchrotron, Galactic free-free, thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, as well as
primary CMB temperature and $\mu$-distortion anisotropies, the latter being added as correlated
field. The Constrained ILC method allows us to null the CMB temperature anisotropies in the reconstructed
$\mu$-map (and vice versa), in addition to mitigating the contaminations from astrophysical foregrounds
and instrumental noise. We compute the cross-power spectrum between the reconstructed (CMB-free)
$\mu$-distortion map and the ($\mu$-free) CMB temperature map, after foreground removal and component
separation. Since the cross-power spectrum is proportional to the primordial non-Gaussianity
parameter, $f_{\rm NL}$, on scales $k\simeq 740$ Mpc$^{-1}$, this allows us to derive $f_{\rm NL}$-detection
limits for the aforementioned future CMB experiments. Our analysis shows that foregrounds degrade
the theoretical detection limits (based mostly on instrumental noise) by more than one order of
magnitude, with PICO standing the best chance at placing upper limits on scale-dependent non-Gaussianity.
We also discuss the dependence of the constraints on the channel sensitivities and chosen bands.
Like for $B$-mode polarization measurements, extended coverage at frequencies $\nu\lesssim
40\,{\rm GHz}$ and $\nu\gtrsim 400\,{\rm GHz}$ provides more leverage than increased channel
sensitivity.
