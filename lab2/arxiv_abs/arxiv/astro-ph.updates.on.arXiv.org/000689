We have conducted a comprehensive search for optical phase variations of all planet candidates
with tight orbits in fifteen quarters of data from the Kepler space telescope. After correcting
for systematics, we found eight systems that appear to show secondary eclipses as well as phase variations.
Of these, five (Kepler-5, Kepler-6, Kepler-8, KOI-64 and KOI-2133) are new and three (TrES-2, HAT-P-7
and KOI-13) have previously published phase curves, albeit with many fewer observations. We model
the full phase curve of each planet candidate, including the primary and secondary transits, and
derive their albedos, day- and night-side temperatures, ellipsoidal variations and Doppler beaming.
We find that KOI-64 and KOI-2133 have night-side temperatures well above their equilibrium values
(while KOI-2133 also has an albedo >1), so we conclude that they are likely to be self-luminous
objects rather than planets. The characteristics of the six other candidates are consistent with
their being planets with low geometric albedos (<0.3). For TrES-2 and KOI-13, the Kepler bandpass
appears to probe atmospheric layers hotter than the planet's equilibrium temperature. For KOI-13,
we detect a never-before-seen third cosine harmonic with an amplitude of 6.7+/-0.3 ppm and a phase
shift of -1.1+/-0.1 radians in the phase curve residual, which could be due to its spin-orbit misalignment.
We report derived planetary parameters for all six planets, including masses from ellipsoidal
variations and Doppler beaming, and compare our results to published values when available. Our
results nearly double the number of Kepler exoplanets with measured phase curve variations, thus
providing valuable new constraints on the properties of close-in hot Jupiters.
