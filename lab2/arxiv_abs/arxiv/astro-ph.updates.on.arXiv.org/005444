The role of magnetic fields in the process of star formation is a matter of continuous debate. Clear
observational proof of the general influence of magnetic fields on the early phase of cloud collapse
is still pending. First results on Bok globules with simple structures indicate dominant magnetic
fields across large spatial scales (Bertrang et al. 2014) The aim of this study is to test the magnetic
field influence across Bok globules with more complex density structures. We apply near-infrared
polarimetry to trace the magnetic field structure on scales of 10^4-10^5 au in selected Bok globules.
The combination of these measurements with archival data in the optical and sub-mm wavelength range
allows us to characterize the magnetic field on scales of 10^3-10^6 au. We present polarimetric
data in the near-infrared wavelength range for the three Bok globules CB34, CB56, and [OMK2002]18,
combined with archival polarimetric data in the optical wavelength range for CB34 and CB56, and
in the sub-millimeter wavelength range for CB34 and [OMK2002]18. We find a strong polarization
signal (P > 2%) in the near-infrared for all three globules. For CB34, we detect a connection between
the structure on scales of 10^4-10^5 au to 10^5-10^6 au. For CB56, we trace aligned polarization
vectors in both the near-infrared and optical data, suggesting a connection of the magnetic field
structure across the whole globule. In the case of [OMK2002]18, we find ordered polarization structures
on scales of 10^4-10^5 au. We find strongly aligned polarization vectors on large scales which indicate
dominant magnetic fields across Bok globules of complex density structures.
