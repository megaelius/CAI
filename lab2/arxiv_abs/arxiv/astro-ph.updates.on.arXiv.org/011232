Consistency between cosmological data sets is essential for ongoing and future cosmological analyses.
We first investigate the questions of stability and applicability of some moment-based inconsistency
measures to multiple data sets. We show that the recently introduced index of inconsistency (IOI)
is numerically stable while it can be applied to multiple data sets. We use an illustrative construction
of constraints as well as an example with real data sets (i.e. WMAP versus Planck) to show some limitations
of the application of the Karhunen-Loeve decomposition to discordance measures. Second, we perform
various consistency analyzes using IOI between multiple current data sets while \textit{working
with the entire common parameter spaces}. We find current Large-Scale-Structure (LSS) data sets
(Planck CMB lensing, DES lensing-clustering and SDSS RSD) all to be consistent with one another.
This is found to be not the case for Planck temperature (TT) versus polarization (TE,EE) data, where
moderate inconsistencies are present. Noteworthy, we find a strong inconsistency between joint
LSS probes and Planck with IOI=5.27, and a moderate tension between DES and Planck with IOI=3.14.
Next, using the IOI metric, we compare the Hubble constant from five independent probes. We confirm
previous strong tensions between local measurement (SH0ES) and Planck as well as between H0LiCOW
and Planck, but also find new strong tensions between SH0ES measurement and the joint LSS probes
with IOI=6.73 (i.e. 3.7-$\sigma$ in 1D) as well as between joint LSS and combined probes SH0ES+H0LiCOW
with IOI=8.59 (i.e. 4.1-$\sigma$ in 1D). Whether due to systematic effects in the data sets or problems
with the underlying model, sources of these old and new tensions need to be identified and dealt with.
