Coagulation theory predicts that micron-sized dust grains grow into pebbles which drift inward
towards the star, when they reach sizes of mm-cm. When they cross the orbit of a planet, a fraction
of these drifting pebbles will be accreted. In the pebble accretion mechanism, the combined effects
of the planet's gravitational attraction and gas drag greatly increase the accretion rate. We calculate
the pebble accretion efficiency $\varepsilon_{2D}$ -- the probability a pebble is accreted by
the planet -- in the 2D limit (pebbles reside in the midplane). In particular, we investigate the
dependence of $\varepsilon_{2D}$ on the planet eccentricity and its implications for planet formation
models. We conduct N-body simulations to calculate the pebble accretion efficiency in both the
local frame and the global frame. With the global method we investigate the pebble accretion efficiency
when the planet is on an eccentric orbit. We find that the local and the global methods generally give
consistent results. The efficiency increases with the planet's eccentricity once the relative
velocity between the pebble and the planet is determined by the planet's eccentric velocity. At
large eccentricities, however, the relative velocity becomes too large for pebble accretion.
The efficiency then drops significantly and the accretion enters the ballistic regime. We present
general expressions for $\varepsilon_{2D}$. Applying the obtained formula to the formation of
a secondary planet, in resonance with an already-formed giant planet, we find that the embryo grows
quickly due to its larger eccentricity. The maximum $\varepsilon_{2D}$ for a planet on an eccentric
orbit is several times higher than for a planet on a circular orbit, but this increase gives the planet
an important headstart and boosts its following mass growth.
