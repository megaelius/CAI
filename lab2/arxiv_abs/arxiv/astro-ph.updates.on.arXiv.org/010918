Magnetars are regarded as the most magnetized neutron stars in the Universe. Aiming to unveil what
kinds of stars and supernovae can create magnetars, we have performed a state-of-the-art spatially
resolved spectroscopic X-ray study of the supernova remnants (SNRs) Kes 73, RCW 103, and N49, which
host magnetars 1E 1841-045, 1E 161348-5055, and SGR 0526-66, respectively. The three SNRs are O-
and Ne-enhanced and are evolving in the interstellar medium with densities of >1--2 cm$^{-3}$.
The metal composition and dense environment indicate that the progenitor stars are not very massive.
The progenitor masses of the three magnetars are constrained to be < 20 Msun (11--15 Msun for Kes 73,
< 13 Msun for RCW 103, and ~13 --17 Msun for N49). Our study suggests that magnetars are not necessarily
made from very massive stars, but originate from stars that span a large mass range. The explosion
energies of the three SNRs range from $10^{50}$ erg to ~2$\times 10^{51}$ erg, further refuting
that the SNRs are energized by rapidly rotating (millisecond) pulsars. We report that RCW 103 is
produced by a weak supernova explosion with significant fallback, as such an explosion explains
the low explosion energy (~$10^{50}$ erg), small observed metal masses ($M_{\rm O}\sim 4\times
10^{-2}$ Msun and $M_{\rm Ne}\sim 6\times 10^{-3}$ Msun), and sub-solar abundances of heavier
elements such as Si and S. Our study supports the fossil field origin as an important channel to produce
magnetars, given the normal mass range ($M_{\rm ZAMS} < 20$ Msun) of the progenitor stars, the low-to-normal
explosion energy of the SNRs, and the fact that the fraction of SNRs hosting magnetars is consistent
with the magnetic OB stars with high fields.
