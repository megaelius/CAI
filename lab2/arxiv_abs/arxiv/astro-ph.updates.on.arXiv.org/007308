Protoplanets of Super-Earth sizes may get trapped in convergence zones for planetary migration
and form gas giants there. These growing planets undergo accretion heating, which triggers a hot-trail
effect that can reverse migration directions, increase eccentricities and prevent resonant captures
(Chrenko et al. 2017). We study populations of embryos accreting pebbles using Fargo-Thorin 2D
hydrocode. We find that embryos in a disk with high surface density ($\Sigma_0 = 990\,{\rm g}\,{\rm
cm}^{-2}$) undergo `unsuccessful' two-body encounters which do not lead to a merger. Only when
a 3rd protoplanet arrives to the convergence zone, three-body encounters lead to mergers. For a
low-viscosity disk ($\nu = 5\times10^{13}\,{\rm cm}^2\,{\rm s}^{-1}$) a massive coorbital is
a possible outcome, for which a pebble isolation develops and the coorbital is stabilised. For more
massive protoplanets ($5\,M_\oplus$), the convergence radius is located further out, in the ice-giant
zone. After a series of encounters, there is an evolution driven by a dynamical torque of a tadpole
region, which is systematically repeated several times, until the coorbital configuration is
disrupted and planets merge. This may be a pathway how to solve the problem that coorbitals often
form in simulations but they are not observed in nature. In contrast, the joint evolution of 120 low-mass
protoplanets ($0.1\,M_\oplus$) reveals completely different dynamics. The evolution is no longer
smooth, but rather a random walk. This is because the spiral arms, developed in the gas disk due to
Lindblad resonances, overlap with each other and affect not only a single protoplanet but several
in the surroundings. Our hydrodynamical simulations may have important implications for N-body
simulations of planetary migration that use simplified torque prescriptions and are thus unable
to capture protoplanet dynamics in its full glory.
