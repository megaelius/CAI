Predictions for the ability of 21-cm interferometric experiments to discriminate Epoch of Reionization
(EoR) signal models are typically limited by the simplicity of data models, whereby foreground
signals and characteristics of the instrument are often simplified or neglected.To move towards
more realistic scenarios, we explore the effects of applying more realistic foreground and instrument
models to the 21cm signal, and the ability to estimate astrophysical parameters with these additional
complexities. We use a highly-optimized version of \textsc{21cmFAST}, integrated into \textsc{21cmMC},
to generate lightcones of the brightness temperature fluctuation for Bayesian parameter estimation.
We include a statistical point-source foreground model and an instrument model based on the Murchison
Widefield Array (MWA) scaled in observation time to have an effective sensitivity similar to the
future Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We also extend the current likelihood prescription to account
for the presence of beam convolution and foregrounds, the 2-Dimensional Power Spectrum (PS), and
the correlation of PS modes. We use frequency bands between 150 and 180 MHz to constrain the ionizing
efficiency ($\zeta$), the minimum virial temperature of halos ($T_{\mathrm{vir}}$), the soft
X-ray emissivity per unit Star Formation Rate (SFR) ($L_X/SFR$ ), and the X-ray energy threshold
($E_0$). We find that the inclusion of realistic foregrounds and instrumental components biases
the parameter constraints due to unaccounted for cross-power between the EoR signal, foregrounds
and thermal noise. This causes estimates of $\zeta$ to be biased by up to $5\sigma$ but the estimates
of $T_{vir}$, L$_X$/SFR and E$_0$ remain unaffected and are all within $1\sigma$.
