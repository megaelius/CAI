X-ray observations of the hot gas filling the intra-cluster medium provide a wealth of information
on the dynamics of clusters of galaxies. The global equilibrium of the ICM is believed to be partially
ensured by non-thermal pressure support, notably the dissipation of energy through turbulent
motions. Accurate mapping of turbulence using X-ray emission lines is challenging due to the lack
of spatially-resolved spectroscopy. Only future instruments such as the X-ray Integral Field
Unit (X-IFU) on Athena will have the spatial and spectral resolution to quantitatively investigate
the ICM turbulence at all scales. Powerful diagnostics for these studies are line shift and the line
broadening maps, and the second-order structure function. When estimating these quantities,
instruments will be limited by uncertainties of their measurements, and by the sample variance
(aka cosmic variance) of the observation. We extend here the formalism started in our companion
paper I to include the effect of statistical uncertainties in the estimation of these line diagnostics,
in particular for structure functions. We demonstrate that statistics contribute to the total
variance through different terms, which depend on the geometry of the detector, the spatial binning
and the nature of the turbulent field. These terms are important when probing the small scales of
the turbulence. An application of these equations is performed for the X-IFU, using synthetic turbulent
velocity maps of a Coma-like cluster of galaxies. Results are in excellent agreement with the formulas
both for the structure function estimation (<3%) and its variance (<10%). The expressions derived
here and in paper I are generic, and ensure an estimation of the total errors in any X-ray measurement
of turbulent structure functions. They also open the way for optimisations in the upcoming instrumentation
and in observational strategies.
