We revisit several aspects of Standard Model physics at finite temperature that drive the theoretical
value of the cosmological parameter $N_{\rm eff}$, the effective number of neutrinos in the early
universe, away from 3. Our chief focus is finite-temperature corrections to the equation of state
of the QED plasma in the vicinity of neutrino decoupling at $T \sim 1$ MeV, where $T$ is the photon temperature.
Working in the instantaneous decoupling approximation, we recover at ${\cal O}(e^2)$, where $e$
is the elementary electric charge, the well-established correction of $\delta N_{\rm eff}^{(2)}
\simeq 0.010$ across a range of plausible neutrino decoupling temperatures, in contrast to an erroneous
claim in the recent literature which found twice as large an effect. At ${\cal O}(e^3)$ we find a new
and significant correction of $\delta N_{\rm eff}^{(3)} \simeq -0.001$ that has so far not been
accounted for in any precision calculation of $N_{\rm eff}$, significant because this correction
is potentially larger than the change in $N_{\rm eff}$ induced between including and excluding
neutrino oscillations in the transport modelling. In addition to the QED equation of state, we make
a first pass at quantifying finite-temperature QED corrections to the weak interaction rates that
directly affect the neutrino decoupling process, and find that the ${\cal O}(e^2)$ thermal electron
mass correction induces a change of $\delta N_{\rm eff}^{m_{\rm th}} \lesssim 10^{-4}$. A complete
assessment of the various effects considered in this work on the final value of $N_{\rm eff}$ will
necessitate an account of neutrino energy transport beyond the instantaneous decoupling approximation.
However, relative to $N_{\rm eff} = 3.044$ obtained in the most recent such calculation, we expect
the new effects found in this work to lower the number to $N_{\rm eff} = 3.043$.
