We present observations of the most bright main sequence stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud stellar
cluster NGC330 obtained with the integral field spectrograph MUSE@VLT. The use of this valuable
instrument allows us to study both photometric and spectroscopic properties of stellar populations
of this young star cluster. The photometric data provide us a precise color magnitude diagram, which
seems to support the presence of two stellar populations of ages of $\sim$ 18 Myr and $\sim$ 30 Myr
assuming a metallicity of Z = 0.002. Thanks to the spectroscopic data, we derive helium abundance
of 10 main sequence stars within the effective radius Reff= 20" of NGC330, thus leading to an estimation
of $\epsilon(He)$ = 10.93 $\pm$ 0.05 (1$\sigma$ ). The helium elemental abundances of stars likely
belonging to the two possible stellar populations, do not show differences or dichotomy within
the uncertainties. Thus, our results suggest that the two stellar populations of NGC330, if they
exist, share similar original He abundances. If we consider stellar rotation velocity in our analysis,
a coeval (30 Myr) stellar population, experiencing different values of rotation, cannot be excluded.
In this case, the mean helium abundance < $\epsilon(He)$ >rot obtained in our analysis is 11.00 $\pm$
0.05 dex. We also verified that possible NLTE effects cannot be identified with our analysis because
of the spectral resolution and they are within our derived abundance He uncertainties. Moreover,
the analysis of the He abundance as a function of the distance from the cluster center of the observed
stars do not show any correlation.
