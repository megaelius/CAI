We report the discovery of a white dwarf exhibiting deep, irregularly shaped transits, indicative
of circumstellar planetary debris. Using Zwicky Transient Facility DR2 photometry of ZTF$\,$J013906.17+524536.89
and follow-up observations from the Las Cumbres Observatory, we identify multiple transit events
that recur every ${\approx}\,107.2\,$d, much longer than the $4.5{-}4.9\,$h orbital periods
observed in WD$\,$1145+017, the only other white dwarf known with transiting planetary debris.
The transits vary in both depth and duration, lasting $15{-}25\,$d and reaching $20{-}45\,\%$
dips in flux. Optical spectra reveal strong Balmer lines, identifying the white dwarf as a DA with
$T_{\mathrm{eff}}=10{,}530\pm140\,\mathrm{K}$ and $\log(g)=7.86\pm0.06$. A $\mathrm{Ca\,II\,K}$
absorption feature is present in all spectra both in and out of transit. Spectra obtained during
one night at roughly $15\,\%$ transit depth show increased $\mathrm{Ca\,II\,K}$ absorption with
a model atmospheric fit suggesting $[\mathrm{Ca/H}]=-4.6\pm0.3$, whereas spectra taken on three
nights out of transit have $[\mathrm{Ca/H}]$ of -5.5, -5.3, and -4.9 with similar uncertainties.
While the $\mathrm{Ca\,II\,K}$ line strength varies by only 2-sigma, we consider a predominantly
interstellar origin for Ca absorption unlikely. We suggest a larger column density of circumstellar
metallic gas along the line of site or increased accretion of material onto the white dwarf's surface
are responsible for the Ca absorption, but further spectroscopic studies are required. In addition,
high-speed time series photometry out of transit reveals variability with periods of 900 and 1030$\,$s,
consistent with ZZ Ceti pulsations.
