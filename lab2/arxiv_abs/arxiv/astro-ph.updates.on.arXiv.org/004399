The central engine of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is poorly constrained. There exist two main candidates:
a fast-rotating black hole and a rapidly spinning magnetar. Furthermore, the X-ray plateaus are
widely accepted by the energy injection into the external shock. In this paper, we systematically
analyze the \emph{Swift}/XRT light curves of 101 GRBs having plateau phases and known redshifts
(before May 2017). Since a maximum energy budget ($\sim2\times10^{52}$ erg) exists for magnetars
but not for a black hole, this provides a good clue to identify the type of GRB central engine. We calculate
the isotropic kinetic energy $E_{\rm K,iso}$ and the isotropic X-ray energy release $E_{\rm X,iso}$
for individual GRB. We identify three categories based on how likely a black hole harbor at central
engine: 'Gold' (9 out of 101, both $E_{\rm X,iso}$ and $E_{\rm K,iso}$ exceed the energy budget),
'Silver' (69 out of 101, $E_{\rm X,iso}$ less than the limit but $E_{\rm K,iso}$ is greater than the
limit), and 'Bronze' (23 out of 101, the energies are not above the limit). We then derive and test
the black hole parameters with the Blandford Znajek mechanism, and find that the observations of
the black hole candidate ('Gold'+'Silver') samples are consistent with the expectations of the
black hole model. Furthermore, we also test the magnetar candidate ('Bronze') sample with the magnetar
model, and find that the magnetar surface magnetic led ($B_{p}$) and initial spin period ($P_{0}$)
are consistent with the expectations of the magnetar model. Our analysis indicates that, if the
magnetar wind is isotropic, a magnetar central engine is possible for 20\% of the analyzed GRBs.
For most GRBs a black hole is most likely operating.
