The location of a galaxy cluster's centroid is typically derived from observations of the galactic
and/or gas component of the cluster, but these typically deviate from the true centre. This can produce
bias when observations are combined to study average cluster properties. Using data from the BAHAMAS
cosmological hydrodynamic simulations we study this bias in both two and three dimensions for 2000
clusters over the $10^{13} - 10^{15} ~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ mass range. We quantify and model the
offset distributions between observationally-motivated centres and the `true' centre of the
cluster, which is taken to be the most gravitationally bound particle measured in the simulation.
We fit the cumulative distribution function of offsets with an exponential distribution and a Gamma
distribution fit well with most of the centroid definitions. The galaxy-based centres can be seen
to be divided into a mis-centred group and a well-centred group, with the well-centred group making
up about $60\%$ of all the clusters. Gas-based centres are overall less scattered than galaxy-based
centres. We also find a cluster-mass dependence of the offset distribution of gas-based centres,
with generally larger offsets for smaller mass clusters. We then measure cluster density profiles
centred at each choice of the centres and fit them with empirical models. Stacked, mis-centred density
profiles fit to the Navarro-Frenk-White dark-matter profile and Komatsu-Seljak gas profile show
that recovered shape and size parameters can significantly deviate from the true values. For the
galaxy-based centres, this can lead to cluster masses being underestimated by up to $10\%$.
