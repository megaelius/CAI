The object W33 is a giant molecular cloud that contains star forming regions at various evolutionary
stages from quiescent clumps to developed H II regions. Since its star forming regions are located
at the same distance and the primary material of the birth clouds is probably similar, we conducted
a comparative chemical study to trace the chemical footprint of the different phases of evolution.
We observed six clumps in W33 with the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) telescope at 280 GHz
and the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at 230 GHz. We detected 27 transitions of 10 different molecules
in the APEX data and 52 transitions of 16 different molecules in the SMA data. The chemistry on scales
larger than $\sim$0.2 pc, which are traced by the APEX data, becomes more complex and diverse the
more evolved the star forming region is. On smaller scales traced by the SMA data, the chemical complexity
and diversity increase up to the hot core stage. In the H II region phase, the SMA spectra resemble
the spectra of the protostellar phase. Either these more complex molecules are destroyed or their
emission is not compact enough to be detected with the SMA. Synthetic spectra modelling of the H$_{2}$CO
transitions, as detected with the APEX telescope, shows that both a warm and a cold component are
needed to obtain a good fit to the emission for all sources except for W33 Main1. The temperatures
and column densities of the two components increase during the evolution of the star forming regions.
The integrated intensity ratios N$_{2}$H$^{+}$(3$-$2)/CS(6$-$5) and N$_{2}$H$^{+}$(3$-$2)/H$_{2}$CO(4$_{2,2}$$-$3$_{2,1}$)
show clear trends as a function of evolutionary stage, luminosity, luminosity-to-mass ratio,
and H$_{2}$ peak column density of the clumps and might be usable as chemical clocks.
