We study the temporal evolution of the habitable zone (HZ) of low-mass stars - only due to stellar
evolution - and evaluate the related uncertainties. These uncertainties are then compared with
those due to the adoption of different climate models. We computed stellar evolutionary tracks
from the pre-main sequence phase to the helium flash at the red-giant branch tip for stars with masses
in the range [0.70 - 1.10] Msun, metallicity Z in the range [0.005 - 0.04], and various initial helium
contents. We evaluated several characteristics of the HZ, such as the distance from the host star
at which the habitability is longest, the duration of this habitability, the width of the zone for
which the habitability lasts one half of the maximum, and the boundaries of the continuously habitable
zone (CHZ) for which the habitability lasts at least 4 Gyr. We developed analytical models, accurate
to the percent level or lower, which allowed to obtain these characteristics in dependence on the
mass and the chemical composition of the host star. The metallicity of the host star plays a relevant
role in determining the HZ. The initial helium content accounts for a variation of the CHZ boundaries
as large as 30% and 10% in the inner and outer border. The computed analytical models allow the first
systematic study of the variability of the CHZ boundaries that is caused by the uncertainty in the
estimated values of mass and metallicity of the host star. An uncertainty range of about 30% in the
inner boundary and 15% in the outer one were found. We also verified that these uncertainties are
larger than that due to relying on recently revised climatic models, which leads to a CHZ boundaries
shift within 5% with respect to those of our reference scenario. We made an on-line tool available
that provides both HZ characteristics and interpolated stellar tracks.
