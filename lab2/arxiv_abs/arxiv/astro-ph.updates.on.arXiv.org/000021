We summarize several new developments in the nuclear equation of state for supernova simulations
and neutron stars. We discuss an updated and improved Notre-Dame-Livermore Equation of State (NDL
EoS) for use in supernovae simulations. This Eos contains many updates. Among them are the effects
of 3- body nuclear forces at high densities and the possible transition to a QCD chiral and/or super-conducting
color phase at densities. We also consider the neutron star equation of state and neutrino transport
in the presence of strong magnetic fields. We study a new quantum hadrodynamic (QHD) equation of
state for neutron stars (with and without hyperons) in the presence of strong magnetic fields. The
parameters are constrained by deduced masses and radii. The calculated adiabatic index for these
magnetized neutron stars exhibit rapid changes with density. This may provide a mechanism for star-quakes
and flares in magnetars. We also investigate the strong magnetic field effects on the moments of
inertia and spin down of neutron stars. The change of the moment of inertia associated with emitted
magnetic flares is shown to match well with observed glitches in some magnetars. We also discuss
a perturbative calculation of neutrino scattering and absorption in hot and dense hyperonic neutron-star
matter in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The absorption cross-sections show a remarkable
angular dependence in that the neutrino absorption strength is reduced in a direction parallel
to the magnetic field and enhanced in the opposite direction. The pulsar kick velocities associated
with this asymmetry comparable to observed pulsar velocities and may affect the early spin down
rate of proto-neutron star magnetars with a toroidal field configuration.
