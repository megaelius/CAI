The production of about half of the heavy elements found in nature is assigned to a specific astrophysical
nucleosynthesis process: the rapid neutron capture process (r-process). Although this idea has
been postulated more than six decades ago, the full understanding faces two types of uncertainties/open
questions: (a) The nucleosynthesis path in the nuclear chart runs close to the neutron-drip line,
where presently only limited experimental information is available, and one has to rely strongly
on theoretical predictions for nuclear properties. (b) While for many years the occurrence of the
r-process has been associated with supernovae, more recent studies have cast substantial doubts
on this environment. Alternative scenarios include the mergers of neutron stars, neutron-star
black hole mergers, but possibly also rare classes of supernovae as well as hypernovae/collapsars
with polar jet ejecta and also accretion disk outflows related to the collapse of fast rotating massive
stars with high magnetic fields. Stellar r-process abundance observations, have provided insights
into, and constraints on the frequency of and conditions in the responsible stellar production
sites. One of them, neutron star mergers, was just identified and related to the Gravitational Wave
event GW170817. High resolution observations, increasingly more precise due to improved experimental
atomic data, have been particularly important in defining the heavy element abundance patterns
of the old halo stars, and thus determining the extent, and nature, of the earliest nucleosynthesis
in our Galaxy. Combining new results and important breakthroughs in the related nuclear, atomic
and astronomical fields of science, this review attempts to provide an answer to the question "How
Were the Elements from Iron to Uranium Made?" (Abridged)
