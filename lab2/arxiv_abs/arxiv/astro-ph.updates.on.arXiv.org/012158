The past four years have seen a scientific revolution through the birth of a new field: gravitational-wave
astronomy. The first detection of gravitational waves---recognised by the 2017 Nobel Prize in
Physics---provided unprecedented tests of general relativity while unveiling a previously unknown
class of massive black holes, thirty times more massive than the Sun. The subsequent detection of
gravitational waves from a merging binary neutron star confirmed the hypothesised connection
between binary neutron stars and short gamma-ray bursts while providing an independent measurement
of the expansion of the Universe. The discovery enabled precision measurement of the speed of gravity
while shedding light on the origin of heavy elements. At the time of writing, the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) and its European partner, Virgo, have published the detection
of eleven gravitational-wave events. New, not-yet-published detections are announced on a nearly
weekly basis. This fast-growing catalogue of gravitational-wave transients is expected to yield
insights into a number of topics, from the equation of state of matter at supra-nuclear densities
to the fate of massive stars. The science potential of 3G observatories is enormous, enabling measurements
of gravitational waves from the edge of the Universe and precise determination of the neutron star
equation of state. Australia is well-positioned to help develop the required technology. The Mid-term
Review for the Decadal plan for Australian astronomy 2016-2025 should consider investment in a
scoping study for an Australian Gravitational-Wave Pathfinder that develops and validates core
technologies required for the global 3G detector network.
