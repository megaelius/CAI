We present a combined radio/X-ray analysis of the poorly studied galaxy cluster Abell 2495 (z=0.07923)
based on new EVLA and Chandra data. We also analyze and discuss Halpha emission and optical continuum
data retrieved from the literature. We find an offset of 6 kpc between the cluster BCG (MCG+02-58-021)
and the peak of the X-ray emission, suggesting that the cooling process is not taking place on the
central galaxy nucleus. We propose that sloshing of the ICM could be responsible for this separation.
Furthermore, we detect a second, 4 kpc offset between the peak of the Halpha emission and that of the
X-ray emission. Optical images highlight the presence of a dust filament extending up to 6 kpc in
the cluster BCG, and allow us to estimate a dust mass within the central 7 kpc of 1.7e+5 Msun. Exploiting
the dust to gas ratio and the L_Halpha-M_mol relation, we argue that a significant amount (up to 10^9
Msun) of molecular gas should be present in the BCG of this cluster. We also investigate the presence
of ICM depressions, finding two putative systems of cavities; the inner pair is characterized by
t age = 18 Myr and P cav = 1.2e+43 erg/s, the outer one by t age = 53 Myr and P cav = 5.6e+42 erg/s. Their age
difference appears to be consistent with the free-fall time of the central cooling gas and with the
offset timescale estimated with the Halpha kinematic data, suggesting that sloshing is likely
playing a key role in this environment. Furthermore, the cavities' power analysis shows that the
AGN energy injection is able to sustain the feedback cycle, despite cooling being offset from the
BCG nucleus.
