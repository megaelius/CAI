We explore the relations between size, stellar mass and average stellar population age (indicated
by D$_n4000$ indices) for a sample of $\sim11000$ intermediate-redshift galaxies from the SHELS
spectroscopic survey (Geller et al. 2014) augmented by high-resolution Subaru Telescope Hyper
Suprime-Cam imaging. In the redshift interval $0.1<z<0.6$, star forming galaxies are on average
larger than their quiescent counterparts. The mass-complete sample of $\sim3500$ $M_*>10^{10}\,
M_\odot$ quiescent galaxies shows that the average size of a $10^{11}\, M_\odot$ quiescent galaxy
increases by $\lesssim25\%$ from $z\sim0.6$ to $z\sim0.1$. This growth rate is a function of stellar
mass: the most massive ($M_*>10^{11}\, M_\odot$) galaxies grow significantly more slowly in size
than an order of magnitude less massive quiescent systems that grow by 70\% in the $0.1\lesssim z\lesssim0.3$
redshift interval. For $M_*<10^{11}\, M_\odot$ galaxies age and size are anti-correlated at fixed
mass; more massive quiescent systems show no significant trend in size with average stellar population
age. The evolution in absolute and fractional abundances of quiescent systems at intermediate
redshift are also a function of galaxy stellar mass. The suite of evolutionary trends suggests that
galaxies more massive than $\sim10^{11}\, M_\odot$ have mostly assembled their mass by $z\sim0.6$.
Quiescent galaxies with lower stellar masses show more complex evolution that is characterized
by a combination of individual quiescent galaxy size growth (through mergers) and an increase in
the size of newly quenched galaxies joining the population at later times (progenitor bias). The
$M_*\sim10^{10}\, M_\odot$ population grows predominantly as a result of progenitor bias. For
$M_*\sim5\times10^{10}\, M_\odot$ quiescent galaxies, mergers and progenitor bias make more
comparable contributions to the size growth.[abridged]
