Formation of organic aerosols driven by photochemical reactions has been observed and suggested
in CH4-containing atmospheres, including Titan and early Earth. However the detailed production
and growth mechanisms of organic aerosols driven by solar far ultraviolet (FUV) light remain poorly
constrained. We conducted laboratory experiments simulating photochemical reactions in a CH4-CO2
atmosphere driven by the FUV radiations dominated by the Lyman-{\alpha} line. In the experiments,
we analyzed time variations in thickness and infrared spectra of solid organic film formed on an
optical window in a reaction cell. Gas species formed by FUV irradiation were also analyzed and compared
with photochemical model calculations. Our experimental results show that the growth rate of the
organic film decreases as the CH4/CO2 ratio of reactant gas mixture decreases, and that the decrease
becomes very steep for CH4/CO2 < 1. Comparison with photochemical model calculations suggests
that polymerizations of gas-phase hydrocarbons, such as polyynes and aromatics, cannot account
for the growth rate of the organic film but that the addition reaction of CH3 radicals onto the organic
film with the reaction probability around 10-2 can explain the growth rate. At CH4/CO2 < 1, etching
by O atom formed by CO2 photolysis would reduce or inhibit the growth of the organic film. Our results
suggest that organic aerosols would grow through CH3 addition onto the surface during the precipitation
of aerosol particles in the middle atmosphere of Titan and early Earth. On Titan, effective CH3 addition
would reduce C2H6 production in the atmosphere. On early Earth, growth of aerosol particles would
be less efficient than those on Titan, possibly resulting in small-sized monomers and influencing
UV shielding.
