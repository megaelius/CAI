Stars often reside in binary configurations. The nuclear star cluster surrounding the supermassive
black hole (SMBH) in the Galactic Center (GC) is expected to include a binary population. In this
dense environment, a binary frequently encounters and interacts with neighboring stars. These
interactions vary from small perturbations to violent collisions. In the former case, weak gravitational
interactions unbind a soft binary over the evaporation timescale, which depends on the binary properties
as well as the density of surrounding objects and velocity dispersion. Similarly, collisions can
also unbind a binary, and the collision rate depends on the density. Thus, the detection of a binary
with known properties can constrain the density profile in the GC with implications for the number
of compact objects, which are otherwise challenging to detect. We estimate the density necessary
to unbind a binary within its lifetime for an orbit of arbitrary eccentricity about the SMBH. We find
that the eccentricity has a minimal impact on the density constraint. In this proof of concept, we
demonstrate that this procedure can probe the density in the GC using hypothetical young and old
binaries as examples. Similarly, a known density profile provides constraints on the binary orbital
separation. Our results highlight the need to consider multiple dynamical processes in tandem.
In certain cases, often closer to the SMBH, the collision timescale rather than the evaporation
timescale gives the more stringent density constraint, while other binaries farther from the SMBH
provide unreliable density constraints because they migrate inwards due to mass segregation.
