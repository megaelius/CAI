The origin and properties of the initial black hole seeds that grow to produce the observed population
of accreting sources remain to be determined. It is a challenge to uniquely disentangle signatures
of seeding from fueling and dynamics that shapes the assembly history of growing black holes. To
address this, we use a semi-analytic model developed to track the growth of supermassive black holes
adopting multiple prescriptions for accretion. In contrast with earlier treatments, we explore
the interplay between seeding models and two accretion modes. We find that signatures of the initial
seeding do survive in the following observational probes: the black hole occupation fraction;
contribution to the unresolved X-ray background; low-luminosity and high-redshift luminosity
functions; and in gravitational wave event signatures. We find that the behaviour of the low-mass
end of the M-sigma relation is dominated by uncertainties in the adopted accretion prescriptions
and does not offer clear discrimination between seeding models. We make concrete predictions for
future surveys, particularly for the Lynx X-ray surveyor and LISA (The Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna) mission, which will each provide different and yet strong constraints on the seed population.
Black hole coalescences detected by LISA and high-redshift quasar luminosity functions observed
by Lynx will offer the sharpest seeding discriminants. Although the signatures of the black hole
seeding mechanism that persist remain linked to our understanding of black hole accretion and dynamics,
we offer new insights on how these upcoming multi-wavelength observations could be leveraged to
effectively disentangle them.
