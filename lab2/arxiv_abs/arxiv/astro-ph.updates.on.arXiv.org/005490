We present a comparative study of molecular and ionized gas kinematics in nearby galaxies. These
results are based on observations from the EDGE survey, which measured spatially resolved $^{12}$CO(J=1-0)
in 126 nearby galaxies. Every galaxy in EDGE has corresponding resolved ionized gas measurements
from CALIFA. Using a sub-sample of 17 rotation dominated, star-forming galaxies where precise
molecular gas rotation curves could be extracted, we derive CO and H$\alpha$ rotation curves using
the same geometric parameters out to $\gtrsim$1 $R_e$. We find that $\sim$75% of our sample galaxies
have smaller ionized gas rotation velocities than the molecular gas in the outer part of the rotation
curve. In no case is the molecular gas rotation velocity measurably lower than that of the ionized
gas. We suggest that the lower ionized gas rotation velocity can be attributed to a significant contribution
from extraplanar diffuse ionized gas in a thick, turbulence supported disk. Using observations
of the H$\gamma$ transition also available from CALIFA, we measure ionized gas velocity dispersions
and find that these galaxies have sufficiently large velocity dispersions to support a thick ionized
gas disk. Kinematic simulations show that a thick disk with a vertical rotation velocity gradient
can reproduce the observed differences between the CO and H$\alpha$ rotation velocities. Observed
line ratios tracing diffuse ionized gas are elevated compared to typical values in the midplane
of the Milky Way. In galaxies affected by this phenomenon, dynamical masses measured using ionized
gas rotation curves will be systematically underestimated.
