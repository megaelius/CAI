The disks around some Herbig Be stars have been observed to be more compact than the expected dust
sublimation radius for such objects, with highly refractory dust grains and optically thick gas
emission having been proposed as possible explanations for this phenomenon. Our aim is to search
for direct evidence for the presence of hot gas inside of the expected dust sublimation radius of
MWC147. By combining VLTI/AMBER spectro-interferometry (R=12,000) with CRIRES spectroscopy
(R=100,000) we can both spectrally and spatially resolve the Br-gamma line-emitting gas around
MWC147. Our interferometric visibility modelling of MWC147 indicates the presence of a compact
continuum disk with a close to face-on orientation. We model the continuum with an inclined Gaussian,
as well as a ring with a radius of 0.60mas (0.39au) which is well within the expected dust sublimation
radius of 1.52au. We detect no significant change in the measured visibilities across the Br-gamma
line, indicating that the line-emitting gas is located in the same region as the continuum-emitting
disk. We fit our AMBER spectro-interferometry data with a kinematic model of a disk in Keplerian
rotation, with both the line-emitting and continuum-emitting components of the disk originating
from the same compact region close to the central star. The presence of line-emitting gas in the same
region as the K-band continuum supports the interpretation that the K-band continuum traces an
optically-thick gas disk. Our spatially and spectrally resolved observations of MWC147 reveal
that the K-band continuum and Br-gamma emission both originate from a similar compact region, with
Br-gamma emitted from the accretion disk or disk wind region and exhibiting a rotational velocity
profile. We conclude that we detect the presence of a compact, gaseous accretion disk in Keplerian
rotation around MWC147.
