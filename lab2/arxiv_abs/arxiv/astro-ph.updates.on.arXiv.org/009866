Context. The precise determination of the present-day expansion rate of the Universe, expressed
through the Hubble constant $H_0$, is one of the most pressing challenges in modern cosmology. Assuming
flat $\Lambda$CDM, $H_0$ inference at high redshift using cosmic-microwave-background data
from Planck disagrees at the 4.4$\sigma$ level with measurements based on the local distance ladder
made up of parallaxes, Cepheids and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), often referred to as "Hubble tension".
Independent, cosmological-model-insensitive ways to infer $H_0$ are of critical importance.
Aims. We apply an inverse-distance-ladder approach, combining strong-lensing time-delay-distance
measurements with SN Ia data. By themselves, SNe Ia are merely good relative distance indicators,
but by anchoring them to strong gravitational lenses one can obtain an $H_0$ measurement that is
relatively insensitive to other cosmological parameters. Methods. A cosmological parameter
estimate is performed for different cosmological background models, both for strong-lensing
data alone and for the combined lensing + SNe Ia data sets. Results. The cosmological-model dependence
of strong-lensing $H_0$ measurements is significantly mitigated through the inverse distance
ladder. In combination with SN Ia data, the inferred $H_0$ consistently lies around 73-74 km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$, regardless of the assumed cosmological background model. Our results agree nicely
with those from the local distance ladder, but there is a >2$\sigma$ tension with Planck results,
and a ~1.5$\sigma$ discrepancy with results from an inverse distance ladder including Planck,
Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and SNe Ia. Future strong-lensing distance measurements will reduce
the uncertainties in $H_0$ from our inverse distance ladder.
