In this paper, we first revisit Parker's [4] ingenius supersonic stellar wind model with a view to
shed further light on some basic aspects of the underlying hydro-and magnetohydrodynamics. We
show that the visualization of an effective de Laval type nozzle associated with Parker's model
is however valid only in a superficial way, and discrepancies arise with regard to density variations.
For strong rotators, the new critical point r=tilde r\equiv (GM/Omega_*^2)^1/3, which is totally
determined by the stellar parameters like the mass M and the angular velocity Omega_*, supersedes
the critical point determined by the speed of sound a in the stellar wind in Parker's model. For a strong
rotator, tilde r <r_*, which corresponds to a critical point low in corona so the stellar wind for
a strong rotator turns out to be tenuous and fast. We then make analytic considerations on the Weber-Davis
[14] magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) extension of Parker's model with a view to provide a qualitative
understanding of the coupling between the magnetic field and the plasma motion in the stellar wind.
We find that, * the angular velocity of the stellar wind falls off more slowly than the inverse-square
radial dependence corresponding to motion with constant angular momentum; * the asymptotic MHD
azimuthal velocity profile actually resembles that for hydrodynamic \textit{Burgers} vortex,
in consistency with the numerical results of Weber and Davis [14]; * Keplerian-orbit conditions
prevail near a strong rotator even in a magnetized situation; * hydrodynamic Parker-type scenario
seems to reappear in the strong magnetization regime, in consistency with the numerical results
of Weber and Davis [14].
