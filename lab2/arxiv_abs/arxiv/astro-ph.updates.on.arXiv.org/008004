Cyclotron lines, also called cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSF) are spectral features,
generally appearing in absorption, in the X-ray spectra of objects containing highly magnetized
neutron stars, allowing the direct measurement of the magnetic field strength in these objects.
Cyclotron features are thought to be due to resonant scattering of photons by electrons in the strong
magnetic fields. The main content of this contribution focusses on electron cyclotron lines as
found in accreting X-ray binary pulsars (XRBP) with magnetic fields on the order of several 1012
Gauss. Also, possible proton cyclotron lines from single neutron stars with even stronger magnetic
fields are briefly discussed.With regard to electron cyclotron lines, we present an updated list
of XRBPs that show evidence of such absorption lines. The first such line was discovered in a 1976
balloon observation of the accreting binary pulsar Hercules X-1, it is considered to be the first
direct measurement of the magnetic field of a neutron star. As of today (mid 2018), we list 36 XRBPs
showing evidence of one ore more electron cyclotron absorption line(s). A few have been measured
only once and must be confirmed (several more objects are listed as candidates). In addition to the
Tables of objects, we summarize the evidence of variability of the cyclotron line as a function of
various parameters (especially pulse phase, luminosity and time), and add a discussion of the different
observed phenomena and associated attempts of theoretical modeling. We also discuss our understanding
of the underlying physics of accretion onto highly magnetized neutron stars. For proton cyclotron
lines, we present tables with seven neutron stars and discuss their nature and the physics in these
objects.
