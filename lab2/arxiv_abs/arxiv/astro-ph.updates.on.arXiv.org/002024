We present optical integral field spectroscopy (IFS) observations of the Mice, a major merger between
two massive (>10^11Msol) gas-rich spirals NGC4676A and B, observed between first passage and
final coalescence. The spectra provide stellar and gas kinematics, ionised gas properties and
stellar population diagnostics, over the full optical extent of both galaxies. The Mice provide
a perfect case study highlighting the importance of IFS data for improving our understanding of
local galaxies. The impact of first passage on the kinematics of the stars and gas has been significant,
with strong bars likely induced in both galaxies. The barred spiral NGC4676B exhibits a strong twist
in both its stellar and ionised gas disk. On the other hand, the impact of the merger on the stellar
populations has been minimal thus far: star formation induced by the recent close passage has not
contributed significantly to the global star formation rate or stellar mass of the galaxies. Both
galaxies show bicones of high ionisation gas extending along their minor axes. In NGC4676A the high
gas velocity dispersion and Seyfert-like line ratios at large scaleheight indicate a powerful
outflow. Fast shocks extend to ~6.6kpc above the disk plane. The measured ram pressure and mass outflow
rate (~8-20Msol/yr) are similar to superwinds from local ULIRGs, although NGC4676A has only a moderate
infrared luminosity of 3x10^10Lsol. Energy beyond that provided by the mechanical energy of the
starburst appears to be required to drive the outflow. We compare the observations to mock kinematic
and stellar population maps from a merger simulation. The models show little enhancement in star
formation during and following first passage, in agreement with the observations. We highlight
areas where IFS data could help further constrain the models.
