The weather layers of the gas giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn, comprise the shallow atmospheric
layers that are influenced energetically by a combination of incoming solar radiation and localised
latent heating of condensates, as well as by upwelling heat from their planetary interiors. They
are also the most accessible regions of those planets to direct observations. Recent analyses in
Oxford of cloud-tracked winds on Jupiter have demonstrated that kinetic energy is injected into
the weather layer at scales comparable to the Rossby radius of deformation and cascades both upscale,
mostly into the extra-tropical zonal jets, and downscale to the smallest resolvable scales in Cassini
images. The large-scale flow on both Jupiter and Saturn appears to equilibrate towards a state which
is close to marginal instability according to Arnol'd's 2nd stability theorem. This scenario is
largely reproduced in a hierarchy of numerical models of giant planet weather layers, including
relatively realistic models which seek to predict thermal and dynamical structures using a full
set of parameterisations of radiative transfer, interior heat sources and even moist convection.
Such models include the Jason GCM, developed in Oxford, which also represents the formation of (energetically
passive) clouds of NH3, NH4SH and H2O condensates and the transport of condensable tracers. Recent
results show some promise in comparison with observations from the Cassini and Juno missions, but
some observed features (such as Jupiter's Great Red Spot and other compact ovals) are not yet captured
spontaneously by any weather layer model. We review recent work in this vein and discuss a number
of open questions for future study.
