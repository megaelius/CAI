PDS 70b is the most robustly detected young planet imaged in the gap of a transition disk so far, found
at a separation of ~195 mas (~22 au) from its host star and at a position angle of about 155 deg. This
system is therefore a unique laboratory to characterize the properties of young planetary systems
at the stage of their formation. We aim to trace direct and indirect imprints of PDS 70b on the gas and
dust emission of the circumstellar disk in order to study the properties of this ~5 Myr young planetary
system. We obtained ALMA band 7 observations of PDS 70 in dust continuum and $^{12}CO$ (3-2) and combined
them with archival data resulting in an unprecedented angular resolution of about 70 mas (~8 au).
We derive an upper limit on circumplanetary material at the location of PDS 70b of ~0.01 $M_{\oplus}$
and find a highly structured circumstellar disk in both dust and gas. The outer dust ring peaks at
~0.65" (74 au) and reveals a possible second unresolved peak at ~0.53" (60 au). The integrated intensity
of CO also shows evidence of a depletion of emission at ~0.2" (23 au) with a width of ~0.1" (11 au). The
gas kinematics show evidence of a deviation from Keplerian rotation inside $\lesssim$0.8" (91
au). This implies a pressure gradient that can account for the location of the dust ring well beyond
the location of PDS 70b. Further in, we detect an inner disk which appears to be connected to the outer
disk by a possible bridge feature in the North-West region in both gas and dust. We compare the observations
to hydrodynamical simulations including a planet with different masses covering the estimated
mass range previously derived from NIR photometry (~5-9 M$_{Jup}$). We find that even a planet with
a mass of 10 M$_{Jup}$ may not be sufficient to explain the extent of the wide gap and an additional
low-mass companion may be needed to account for the observed disk morphology.
