The Moon-forming giant impact extensively melts and partially vaporizes the silicate Earth and
delivers a substantial mass of metal to Earth's core. Subsequent evolution of the magma ocean and
overlying atmosphere has been described by theoretical models but observable constraints on this
epoch have proved elusive. Here, we report calculations of the primordial atmosphere during the
magma ocean and water ocean epochs and forge new links with observations to gain insight into the
behavior of volatiles on the early Earth. As Earth's magma ocean crystallizes, it outgasses the
bulk of the volatiles into the primordial atmosphere. The redox state of the magma ocean controls
both the chemical composition of the outgassed volatiles and the hydrogen isotopic composition
of water oceans that remain after hydrogen loss from the primordial atmosphere. Whereas water condenses
and is retained, molecular hydrogen does not condense and can escape, allowing large quantities
(~10^2 bars) of hydrogen - if present - to be lost from Earth in this epoch. Because the escaping inventory
of H can be comparable to the hydrogen inventory in the early oceans, the corresponding deuterium
enrichment can be large with a magnitude that depends on the initial H2 inventory. By contrast, the
common view that terrestrial water has a carbonaceous chondrite source requires the oceans to preserve
the isotopic composition of that source, undergoing minimal D-enrichment via H2 loss. Such minimal
enrichment places upper limits on the amount of primordial H2 in contact with early water oceans
(pH2<20 bars), implies oxidizing conditions for outgassing from the magma ocean, and suggests
that Earth's mantle supplied the oxidant for the chemical resorption of metals during late accretion.
