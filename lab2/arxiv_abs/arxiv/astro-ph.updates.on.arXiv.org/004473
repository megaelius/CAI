We present the clustering measurements of quasars in configuration space based on the Data Release
14 (DR14) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey.
This dataset includes 148,659 quasars spread over the redshift range $0.8\leq z \leq 2.2$ and spanning
2112.9 square degrees. We use the Convolution Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (CLPT) approach
with a Gaussian Streaming (GS) model for the redshift space distortions of the correlation function
and demonstrate its applicability for dark matter halos hosting eBOSS quasar tracers. At the effective
redshift $z_{\rm eff} = 1.52$, we measure the linear growth rate of structure $f\sigma_{8}(z_{\rm
eff})= 0.426 \pm 0.077$, the expansion rate $H(z_{\rm eff})= 159^{+12}_{-13}(r_{s}^{\rm fid}/r_s){\rm
km.s}^{-1}.{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, and the angular diameter distance $D_{A}(z_{\rm eff})=1850^{+90}_{-115}\,(r_s/r_{s}^{\rm
fid}){\rm Mpc}$, where $r_{s}$ is the sound horizon at the end of the baryon drag epoch and $r_{s}^{\rm
fid}$ is its value in the fiducial cosmology. The quoted errors include both systematic and statistical
contributions. The results on the evolution of distances are consistent with the predictions of
flat $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$-CDM) cosmology with Planck parameters, and the measurement
of $f\sigma_{8}$ extends the validity of General Relativity (GR) to higher redshifts($z>1$) This
paper is released with companion papers using the same sample. The results on the cosmological parameters
of the studies are found to be in very good agreement, providing clear evidence of the complementarity
and of the robustness of the first full-shape clustering measurements with the eBOSS DR14 quasar
sample.
