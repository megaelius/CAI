The creation of a 3D map of the bulge using RRLyrae (RRL) is one of the main goals of the VVV(X) surveys.
The overwhelming number of sources under analysis request the use of automatic procedures. In this
context, previous works introduced the use of Machine Learning (ML) methods for the variable star
classification. Our goal is the development and analysis of an automatic procedure, based on ML,
for the identification of RRLs in the VVV Survey. This procedure will be use to generate reliable
catalogs integrated over several tiles in the survey. After the reconstruction of light-curves,
we extract a set of period and intensity-based features. We use for the first time a new subset of pseudo
color features. We discuss all the appropriate steps needed to define our automatic pipeline: selection
of quality measures; sampling procedures; classifier setup and model selection. As final result,
we construct an ensemble classifier with an average Recall of 0.48 and average Precision of 0.86
over 15 tiles. We also make available our processed datasets and a catalog of candidate RRLs. Perhaps
most interestingly, from a classification perspective based on photometric broad-band data,
is that our results indicate that Color is an informative feature type of the RRL that should be considered
for automatic classification methods via ML. We also argue that Recall and Precision in both tables
and curves are high quality metrics for this highly imbalanced problem. Furthermore, we show for
our VVV data-set that to have good estimates it is important to use the original distribution more
than reduced samples with an artificial balance. Finally, we show that the use of ensemble classifiers
helps resolve the crucial model selection step, and that most errors in the identification of RRLs
are related to low quality observations of some sources or to the difficulty to resolve the RRL-C
type given the date.
