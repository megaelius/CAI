Dynamic model atmospheres of Mira stars predict variabilities in the photospheric radius and in
atmospheric molecular layers which are not yet strongly constrained by observations. Here we measure
the variability of the oxygen-rich Mira star R Peg. We used K band spectro-interferometry with a
spectral resolution of about 4000 obtained at four epochs between post-maximum and minimum visual
phases employing the newly available GRAVITY beam combiner at the VLTI. Our observations show a
continuum radius that is anti-correlated with the visual lightcurve. Uniform disc (UD) angular
diameters at a near-continuum wavelength of 2.25 mu are steadily increasing with values of 8.7 mas,
9.4 mas, 9.8 mas, and 9.9 mas at visual phases of 0.15, 0.36, 0,45, 0.53, respectively. UD diameters
at a bandpass around 2.05 mu, dominated by water vapour, follow the near-continuum variability
at larger UD diameters. UD diameters at the CO 2-0 bandhead, instead, are correlated with the visual
lightcurve and anti-correlated with the near-continuum UD diameters. The observed anti-correlation
between continuum radius and visual lightcurve is consistent with an earlier study of the oxygen-rich
Mira S Lac, and with recent 1D CODEX dynamic model atmosphere predictions. The amplitude of the variation
is comparable to the earlier observations of S Lac, and smaller than predicted by CODEX models. The
wavelength-dependent visibility variations at our epochs can be reproduced by a set of CODEX models
at model phases between 0.3 and 0.6. The anti-correlation of water vapour and CO contributions at
our epochs suggests that these molecules undergo different processes along the stellar cycle.
The newly available GRAVITY instrument is suited to conducting longer time series observations,
which are needed to provide strong constraints on the model-predicted intra- and inter-cycle variability.
