Emission from Sgr A* is highly variable at both X-ray and infrared (IR) wavelengths. Observations
over the last ~20 years have revealed X-ray flares that rise above a quiescent thermal background
about once per day, while faint X-ray flares from Sgr A* are undetectable below the constant thermal
emission. In contrast, the IR emission of Sgr A* is observed to be continuously variable. Recently,
simultaneous observations have indicated a rise in IR flux density around the same time as every
distinct X-ray flare, while the opposite is not always true (peaks in the IR emission may not be coincident
with an X-ray flare). Characterizing the behaviour of these simultaneous X-ray/IR events and measuring
any time lag between them can constrain models of Sgr A*'s accretion flow and the flare emission mechanism.
Using 100+ hours of data from a coordinated campaign between the Spitzer Space Telescope and the
Chandra X-ray Observatory, we present results of the longest simultaneous IR and X-ray observations
of Sgr A* taken to date. The cross-correlation between the IR and X-ray light curves in this unprecedented
dataset, which includes four modest X-ray/IR flares, indicates that flaring in the X-ray may lead
the IR by approximately 10-20 minutes with 68% confidence. However, the 99.7% confidence interval
on the time-lag also includes zero, i.e., the flaring remains statistically consistent with simultaneity.
Long duration and simultaneous multiwavelength observations of additional bright flares will
improve our ability to constrain the flare timing characteristics and emission mechanisms, and
must be a priority for Galactic Center observing campaigns.
