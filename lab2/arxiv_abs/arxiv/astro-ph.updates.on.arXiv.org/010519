Planets residing in circumstellar habitable zones (CHZs) offer our best opportunities to test
hypotheses of life's potential pervasiveness and complexity. Constraining the precise boundaries
of habitability and its observational discriminants is critical to maximizing our chances at remote
life detection with future instruments. Conventionally, calculations of the inner edge of the
habitable zone (IHZ) have been performed using both 1D radiative-convective and 3D general circulation
models. However, these models lack interactive three-dimensional chemistry and do not resolve
the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region of the upper atmosphere. Here we employ a 3D high-top
chemistry-climate model (CCM) to simulate the atmospheres of synchronously-rotating planets
orbiting at the inner edge of habitable zones of K- and M-dwarf stars (between $T_{\rm eff} =$ 2600
K and 4000 K). While our IHZ climate predictions are in good agreement with GCM studies, we find noteworthy
departures in simulated ozone and HO$_{\rm x}$ photochemistry. For instance, climates around
inactive stars do not typically enter the classical moist greenhouse regime even with high ($> 10^{-3}$
mol mol$^{-1}$) stratospheric water vapor mixing ratios, which suggests that planets around inactive
M-stars may only experience minor water-loss over geologically significant timescales. In addition,
we find much thinner ozone layers on potentially habitable moist greenhouse atmospheres, as ozone
experiences rapid destruction via reaction with hydrogen oxide radicals. Using our CCM results
as inputs, our simulated transmission spectra and secondary eclipse thermal emission spectra
show that both water vapor and ozone features of these atmospheres could be detectable by instruments
NIRSpec and MIRI LRS aboard the James Webb Space Telescope.
