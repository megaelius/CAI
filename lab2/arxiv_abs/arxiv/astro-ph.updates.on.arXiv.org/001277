We investigate the dynamics of two satellites with masses $\mu_s$ and $\mu'_s$ orbiting a massive
central planet in a common plane, near a first order mean motion resonance $m$+1:$m$ ($m$ integer).
We consider only the resonant terms of first order in eccentricity in the disturbing potential of
the satellites, plus the secular terms causing the orbital apsidal precessions. We obtain a two-degree
of freedom system, associated with the two critical resonant angles $\phi= (m+1)\lambda' -m\lambda
- \varpi$ and $\phi'= (m+1)\lambda' -m\lambda - \varpi'$, where $\lambda$ and $\varpi$ are the
mean longitude and longitude of periapsis of $\mu_s$, respectively, and where the primed quantities
apply to $\mu'_s$. We consider the special case where $\mu_s \rightarrow 0$ (restricted problem).
The symmetry between the two angles $\phi$ and $\phi'$ is then broken, leading to two different kinds
of resonances, classically referred to as Corotation Eccentric resonance (CER) and Lindblad Eccentric
Resonance (LER), respectively. We write the four reduced equations of motion near the CER and LER,
that form what we call the CoraLin model. This model depends upon only two dimensionless parameters
that control the dynamics of the system: the distance $D$ between the CER and LER, and a forcing parameter
$\epsilon_L$ that includes both the mass and the orbital eccentricity of the disturbing satellite.
Three regimes are found: for $D=0$ the system is integrable, for $D$ of order unity, it exhibits prominent
chaotic regions, while for $D$ large compared to 2, the behavior of the system is regular and can be
qualitatively described using simple adiabatic invariant arguments. We apply this model to three
recently discovered small Saturnian satellites dynamically linked to Mimas through first order
mean motion resonances : Aegaeon, Methone and Anthe.
