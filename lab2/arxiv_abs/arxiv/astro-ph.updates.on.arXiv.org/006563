Galaxy groups and clusters are formidable cosmological probes. They permit the studying of the
environmental effects on galaxy formation. A reliable detection of galaxy groups is an open problem
and is important for ongoing and future cosmological surveys. We propose a probabilistic galaxy
group detection algorithm based on marked point processes with interactions. The pattern of galaxy
groups in a catalogue is seen as a random set of interacting objects. The positions and the interactions
of these objects are governed by a probability density. The estimator of the unknown cluster pattern
is given by the configuration of objects maximising the proposed probability density. Adopting
the Bayesian framework, the proposed probability density is maximised using a simulated annealing
algorithm. The method provides "for free" additional information such as the probabilities that
a point or two points in the observation domain belong to the cluster pattern, respectively. These
supplementary tools allow the construction of tests and techniques to validate and to refine the
detection result. To test the feasibility of the proposed methodology, we applied it to the well-studied
2MRS data set. Compared to previously published Friends-of-Friends (FoF) group finders, the proposed
Bayesian group finder gives overall similar results. The proposed Bayesian group finder is tested
on a galaxy redshift survey, but more detailed analyses are needed to understand the actual capabilities
of the algorithm regarding upcoming cosmological surveys. The presented mathematical framework
permits adapting it easily for other data sets (in astronomy and in other fields of sciences). In
cosmology, one promising application is the detection of galaxy groups in photometric galaxy redshift
surveys, while taking into account the full photometric redshift posteriors. (abridged)
