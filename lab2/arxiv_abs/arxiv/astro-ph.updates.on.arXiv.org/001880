Multiple generations of stars are routinely encountered in globular clusters but no convincing
evidence has been found in Galactic open clusters to date. In this paper we use new photometric and
spectroscopic data to search for multiple stellar population signatures in the old, massive open
cluster, Melotte~66. The cluster is known to have a red giant branch wide in color, which could be
an indication of metallicity spread. Also the main sequence is wider than what is expected from photometric
errors only. This evidence might be associated with either differential reddening or binaries.
Both hypothesis have, however, to be evaluated in detail before recurring to the presence of multiple
stellar populations. New, high-quality, CCD UBVI photometry have been acquired to this aim with
high-resolution spectroscopy of seven clump stars, that are complemented with literature data.
Our photometric study confirms that the width of the main sequence close to the turn off point is entirely
accounted for by binary stars and differential reddening, with no need to advocate more sofisticated
scenarios, such as metallicity spread or multiple main sequences. By constructing synthetic color-magnitude
diagrams, we infer that the binary fraction has to be as large as 30$%$ and their mass ratio in the range
0.6-1.0. As a by-product of our simulations, we provide new estimates of the cluster fundamental
parameters. We measure a reddening E(B-V)=0.15$\pm$0.02, and confirm the presence of a marginal
differential reddening. The distance to the cluster is $4.7^{+0.2}_{-0.1} $kpc and the age is 3.4$\pm$0.3
Gyr, which is somewhat younger and better constrained than previous estimates. Our detailed abundance
analysis reveals that, overall, Melotte~66 looks like a typical object of the old thin disk population.
