The observation of GW170817 binary neutron star (BNS) merger event has imposed strong bounds on
the speed of gravitational waves (GWs) locally, inferring that the speed of GWs propagation is equal
to the speed of light. Current GW detectors in operation will not be able to observe BNS merger to long
cosmological distance, where possible cosmological corrections on the cosmic expansion history
are expected to play an important role, specially for investigating possible deviations from general
relativity. Future GW detectors designer projects will be able to detect many coalescences of BNS
at high $z$, such as the third generation of the ground GW detector called Einstein Telescope (ET)
and the space-based detector deci-hertz interferometer gravitational wave observatory (DECIGO).
In this paper, we relax the condition $c_T/c = 1$ to investigate modified GW propagation where the
speed of GWs propagation is not necessarily equal to the speed of light. Also, we consider the possibility
for the running of the Planck mass corrections on modified GW propagation. We parametrize both corrections
in terms of an effective GW luminosity distance and we perform a forecast analysis using standard
siren events from BNS mergers, within the sensitivity predicted for the ET and DECIGO. We find at
high $z$ very strong forecast bounds on the running of the Planck mass, namely $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$
and $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ from ET and DECIGO, respectively. Possible anomalies on GW propagation
are bound to $|c_T/c - 1| \leq 10^{-2} \,\,\, (10^{-2})$ from ET (DECIGO), respectively. We finally
discuss the consequences of our results on modified gravity phenomenology.
