(shortened) The peculiar chemistry observed in the multiple populations of Galactic globular
clusters is not generally found in other systems like dwarf galaxies and open clusters, and at the
moment no model can fully explain its presence. Exploring the boundaries of the multiple population
phenomenon and the variation of its extent in the space of cluster mass, age, metallicity, and compactness
has proven to be a fruitful line of investigation. In the framework of a larger project to search for
multiple population in open clusters, based on literature and survey data, I found peculiar chemical
abundance patterns in a sample of intermediate age open clusters with publicly available data.
More specifically, fast rotating dwarf stars (v sini > 50km/s) belonging to four clusters display
a bimodality in either [Na/Fe], [O/Fe] or both. Additionally, two clusters show a Na-O anticorrelation
in the fast rotating stars and one cluster shows a large [Mg/Fe] variation among the stars with high
[Na/Fe], reaching the extreme Mg depletion observed in NGC 2808. Even considering that the sample
sizes are small, these patterns call for attention in the light of a possible connection with the
multiple population phenomenon of globular clusters. The specific chemistry observed in these
fast rotating dwarf stars is thought to be produced by a complex interplay of different diffusion
and mixing mechanisms, like rotational mixing and mass loss, in turn influenced by metallicity,
binarity, mass, age, variability, and so on. However, with the sample in hand, it was not possible
to identify which stellar parameters cause the observed Na and O bimodality and Na-O anticorrelation,
suggesting that other stellar properties might be important besides stellar rotation.
