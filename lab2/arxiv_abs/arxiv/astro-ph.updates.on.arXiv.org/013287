Due to the efforts by numerous ground-based surveys and NASA's Kepler and TESS, there will be hundreds,
if not thousands, of transiting exoplanets ideal for atmospheric characterization via spectroscopy
with large platforms such as JWST and ARIEL. However their next predicted mid-transit time could
become so increasingly uncertain over time that significant overhead would be required to ensure
the detection of the entire transit. As a result, follow-up observations to characterize these
exoplanetary atmospheres would require less-efficient use of an observatory's time---which
is an issue for large platforms where minimizing observing overheads is a necessity. Here we demonstrate
the power of citizen scientists operating smaller observatories ($\le$1-m) to keep ephemerides
"fresh", defined here as when the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty in the mid-transit time is less than half
the transit duration. We advocate for the creation of a community-wide effort to perform ephemeris
maintenance on transiting exoplanets by citizen scientists. Such observations can be conducted
with even a 6-inch telescope, which has the potential to save up to $\sim$8000 days for a 1000-planet
survey. Based on a preliminary analysis of 14 transits from a single 6-inch MicroObservatory telescope,
we empirically estimate the ability of small telescopes to benefit the community. Observations
with a small-telescope network operated by citizen scientists are capable of resolving stellar
blends to within 5''/pixel, can follow-up long period transits in short-baseline TESS fields,
monitor epoch-to-epoch stellar variability at a precision 0.67% $\pm$ 0.12% for a 11.3 V-mag star,
and search for new planets or constrain the masses of known planets with transit timing variations
greater than two minutes.
