The values of the fundamental constants such as $\mu = m_P/m_e$, the proton to electron mass ratio
and $\alpha$, the fine structure constant, are sensitive to the product $\sqrt{\zeta_x^2(w+1)}$
where $\zeta_x$ is a coupling constant between a rolling scalar field responsible for the acceleration
of the expansion of the universe and the electromagnetic field with x standing for either $\mu$ or
$\alpha$. The dark energy equation of state $w$ can assume values different than $-1$ in cosmologies
where the acceleration of the expansion is due to a scalar field. In this case the value of both $\mu$
and $\alpha$ changes with time. The values of the fundamental constants, therefore, monitor the
equation of state and are a valuable tool for determining $w$ as a function of redshift. In fact the
rolling of the fundamental constants is one of the few definitive discriminators between acceleration
due to a cosmological constant and acceleration due to a quintessence rolling scalar field. $w$
is often given in parameterized form for comparison with observations. In this manuscript the predicted
evolution of $\mu$, is calculated for a range of parameterized equation of state models and compared
to the observational constraints on $\Delta \mu / \mu$. We find that the current limits on $\Delta
\mu / \mu$ place significant constraints on linear equation of state models and on thawing models
where $w$ deviates from $-1$ at late times. They also constrain non-dynamical models that have a
constant $w$ not equal to $-1$. These constraints are an important compliment to geometric tests
of $w$ in that geometric tests are sensitive to the evolution of the universe before the epoch of observation
while fundamental constants are sensitive to the evolution of the universe after the observational
epoch. Abstract truncated.
