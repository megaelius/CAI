The H\beta\ emission line in a typical Type I quasar is composed of a broad base and a narrow core, with
the core velocity typical of narrow-line region emission, and line-fitting routines typically
assume this picture. We test the effects of removing this constraint, and find a substantial group
of Type I quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey catalog with H\beta\ emission line cores broader
than 1200 km/s, above the velocity believed possible for gas in the quasar narrow-line region. We
identify this group of "anomalous H\beta\ quasars" (AHQs) as a distinct population because of a
variety of spectral and photometric signatures common to these AHQs but atypical of other quasars.
These features are similar to some aspects of narrow-line Seyfert 1s and correlations identified
by Eigenvector 1, but also contain distinct features that make AHQs difficult to classify. We demonstrate
that AHQs comprise at least 11% and most likely approximately one quarter of the SDSS Type I quasar
population at 0.2 < z < 0.8. For AHQs, the [O III]\lambda 4959,5007 profile is often better
fit by de-linking it from the H\beta\ core, while a more standard linked fit produces a tight correlation
between narrow- and broad-line velocities. We find that [O III] in AHQs sometimes has a standard
narrow-line profile and other times matches the H\beta core, but is rarely in between the two, implying
that the broadened core emission arises from a distinct physical region. Another feature of AHQs
is a diminished [O II] line, which might indicate a connection between AHQs and the interstellar
mediums of their host galaxies, through reduced photoionization or star formation. We find that
it is difficult to produce AHQs using the current quasar standard model.
