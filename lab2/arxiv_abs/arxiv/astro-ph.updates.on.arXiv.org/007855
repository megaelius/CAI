Methods: We observed the high-mass hot core region G351.77-0.54 with ALMA and more than 16km baselines.
Results: At a spatial resolution of 18/40au (depending on the distance), we identify twelve sub-structures
within the inner few thousand au of the region. The brightness temperatures are high, reaching values
greater 1000K, signposting high optical depth toward the peak positions. Core separations vary
between sub-100au to several 100 and 1000au. The core separations and approximate masses are largely
consistent with thermal Jeans fragmentation of a dense gas core. Due to the high continuum optical
depth, most spectral lines are seen in absorption. However, a few exceptional emission lines are
found that most likely stem from transitions with excitation conditions above1000K. Toward the
main continuum source, these emission lines exhibit a velocity gradient across scales of 100-200au
aligned with the molecular outflow and perpendicular to the previously inferred disk orientation.
While we cannot exclude that these observational features stem from an inner hot accretion disk,
the alignment with the outflow rather suggests that it stems from the inner jet and outflow region.
The highest-velocity features are found toward the peak position, and no Hubble-like velocity
structure can be identified. Therefore, these data are consistent with steady-state turbulent
entrainment of the hot molecular gas via Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities at the interface between
the jet and the outflow. Conclusions: Resolving this high-mass star-forming region at sub-50au
scales indicates that the hierarchical fragmentation process in the framework of thermal Jeans
fragmentation can continue down to the smallest accessible spatial scales. Velocity gradients
on these small scales have to be treated cautiously and do not necessarily stem from disks, but may
be better explained with outflow emission.
