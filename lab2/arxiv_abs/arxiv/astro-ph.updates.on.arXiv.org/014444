The Complete Calibration of the Colour-Redshift Relation survey (C3R2) is a spectroscopic effort
involving ESO and Keck facilities designed to empirically calibrate the galaxy colour-redshift
relation - P(z|C) to the Euclid depth (i_AB=24.5) and is intimately linked to upcoming Stage IV dark
energy missions based on weak lensing cosmology. The aim is to build a spectroscopic calibration
sample that is as representative as possible of the galaxies of the Euclid weak lensing sample. In
order to minimise the number of spectroscopic observations to fill the gaps in current knowledge
of the P(z|C), self-organising map (SOM) representations of the galaxy colour space have been constructed.
Here we present the first results of an ESO@ VLT Large Programme approved in the context of C3R2, which
makes use of the two VLT optical and near-infrared multi-object spectrographs, FORS2 and KMOS.
This paper focuses on high-quality spectroscopic redshifts of high-z galaxies observed with the
KMOS spectrograph in the H- and K-bands. A total of 424 highly-reliable z are measured in the 1.3<=z<=2.5
range, with total success rates of 60.7% in the H-band and 32.8% in the K-band. The newly determined
z fill 55% of high and 35% of lower priority empty SOM grid cells. We measured Halpha fluxes in a 1."2
radius aperture from the spectra of the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies and converted them
into star formation rates. In addition, we performed an SED fitting analysis on the same sample in
order to derive stellar masses, E(B-V), total magnitudes, and SFRs. We combine the results obtained
from the spectra with those derived via SED fitting, and we show that the spectroscopic failures
come from either weakly star-forming galaxies (at z<1.7, i.e. in the H-band) or low S/N spectra (in
the K-band) of z>2 galaxies.
