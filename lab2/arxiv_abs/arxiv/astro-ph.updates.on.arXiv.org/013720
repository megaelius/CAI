We report on the results of a NuSTAR observation of the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient pulsar IGRJ11215-5952
during the peak of its outburst in June 2017. IGRJ11215-5952 is the only SFXT undergoing strictly
periodic outbursts, every 165 days. NuSTAR caught several X-ray flares, spanning a dynamic range
of 100, and detected X-ray pulsations at 187.0 s, consistent with previous measurements. The spectrum
from the whole observation is well described by an absorbed power-law (with a photon index of 1.4)
modified, above 7 keV, by a cutoff with an e-folding energy of 24 keV. A weak emission line is present
at 6.4 keV, consistent with Kalpha emission from cold iron in the supergiant wind. The time-averaged
flux is 1.5E-10 erg/cm2/s (3-78 keV, corrected for the absorption), translating into an average
luminosity of about 9E35 erg/s (1-100 keV, assuming a distance of 6.5 kpc). The NuSTAR observation
allowed us to perform the most sensitive search for cyclotron resonant scattering features in the
hard X-ray spectrum, resulting in no significant detection in any of the different spectral extractions
adopted (time-averaged, temporally-selected, spin-phase-resolved and intensity-selected
spectra). The pulse profile showed an evolution with both the energy (3-12 keV energy range compared
with 12-78 keV band) and the X-ray flux: a double peaked profile was evident at higher fluxes (and
in both energy bands), while a single peaked, sinusoidal profile was present at the lowest intensity
state achieved within the NuSTAR observations (in both energy bands). The intensity-selected
analysis allowed us to observe an anti-correlation of the pulsed fraction with the X-ray luminosity.
The pulse profile evolution can be explained by X-ray photon scattering in the accreting matter
above magnetic poles of a neutron star at the quasi-spherical settling accretion stage.
