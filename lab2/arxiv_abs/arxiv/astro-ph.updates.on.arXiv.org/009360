We have carried out a numerical investigation of the coupled gravitational and non-gravitational
perturbations acting on Earth satellite orbits in an extensive grid, covering the whole circumterrestrial
space, using an appropriately modified version of the SWIFT symplectic integrator, which is suitable
for long-term (120 years) integrations of the non-averaged equations of motion. Hence, we characterize
the long-term dynamics and the phase-space structure of the Earth-orbiter environment, starting
from low altitudes (400 km) and going up to the GEO region and beyond. This investigation was done
in the framework of the EC-funded "ReDSHIFT" project, with the purpose of enabling the definition
of passive debris removal strategies, based on the use of physical mechanisms inherent in the complex
dynamics of the problem (i.e., resonances). Accordingly, the complicated interactions among
resonances, generated by different perturbing forces (i.e., lunisolar gravity, solar radiation
pressure, tesseral harmonics in the geopotential) are accurately depicted in our results, where
we can identify the regions of phase space where the motion is regular and long-term stable and regions
for which eccentricity growth and even instability due to chaotic behavior can emerge. The results
are presented in an "atlas" of dynamical stability maps for different orbital zones, with a particular
focus on the (drag-free) range of semimajor axes, where the perturbing effects of the Earth's oblateness
and lunisolar gravity are of comparable order. In some regions, the overlapping of the predominant
lunisolar secular and semi-secular resonances furnish a number of interesting disposal hatches
at moderate to low eccentricity orbits. All computations were repeated for an increased area-to-mass
ratio, simulating the case of a satellite equipped with an on-board, area-augmenting device.
