We report the discovery of two planets transiting the bright stars HD 89345 (EPIC 248777106, V = 9.376,
K = 7.721) in K2 Campaign 14 and HD 286123 (EPIC 247098361, V = 9.822, K = 8.434) in K2 Campaign 13. Both
stars are G-type stars, one of which is at or near the end of its main sequence lifetime, and the other
that is just over halfway through its main sequence lifetime. HD 89345 hosts a warm sub-Saturn (0.616
$R_J$, 0.103 $M_J$, $T_{eq}$ = 1059 K) in an 11.81-day orbit. The planet is similar in size to WASP-107b,
which falls in the transition region between ice giants and gas giants. HD 286123 hosts a Jupiter-sized,
low-mass planet (1.080 $R_J$, 0.408 $M_J$, $T_{eq}$ = 999 K) in an 11.17-day, mildly eccentric orbit,
with $e = 0.268\pm 0.037$. Given that they orbit relatively evolved main-sequence stars with ages
of ~5-7 Gyr, and have orbital periods longer than 10 days, these planets are interesting candidates
for studies of gas planet evolution, migration, and (potentially) re-inflation. Both planets
have spent their entire lifetimes near the proposed stellar irradiation threshold at which giant
planets become inflated, and neither shows any sign of radius inflation. They probe the regime where
inflation begins to become noticeable and are valuable in constraining planet inflation models.
In addition, the brightness of the host stars, combined with large atmospheric scale heights of
the planets, makes these two systems exceptionally favorable targets for transit spectroscopy
to study their atmospheres and perhaps provide insight into the physical mechanisms that that lead
to inflated hot Jupiters.
