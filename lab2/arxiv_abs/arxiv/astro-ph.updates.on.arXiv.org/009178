The identification of the carriers of the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) remains to be established,
with the exception of five bands attributed to C60+, although it is generally agreed that DIB carriers
should be large carbon-based molecules (with ~10-100 atoms) in the gas phase, such as polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), long carbon chains or fullerenes. More specific possible carriers
among PAHs are investigated, namely elongated molecules, which could explain a correlation between
the DIB wavelength and the apparent UV resilience of their carriers. We address the case of polyacenes,
C4N+2-H2N+4, with N~10-18 fused rectilinear aligned hexagons. Polyacenes are attractive DIB
carrier candidates because their high symmetry and large linear size allow them to form regular
series of bands in the visible range with strengths larger than most other PAHs, as confirmed by recent
laboratory results up to undecacene (C46H26). Those with very strong bands in the DIB spectral domain
are just at the limit of stability against UV photodissociation. They are part of the prominent PAH
family of interstellar carbon compounds, meaning that only ~10-5 of the total PAH abundance is enough
to account for a medium-strength DIB. After summarizing the current knowledge about the properties
of polyacenes and recent laboratory results, the likelihood that they might meet the criteria for
being carriers of some DIBs is addressed by reviewing the following properties: wavelength and
strength of their series of visible bands; interstellar stability and abundances, charge state
and hydrogenation; and DIB rotation profiles. No definite inconsistency has been identified that
precludes polyacenes from being the carriers of some DIBs with medium or weak strength, including
the so-called C2 DIBs. But additional experimental data about long acenes and their visible bands
are needed to make robust conclusions
