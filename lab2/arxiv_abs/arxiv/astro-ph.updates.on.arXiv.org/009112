The equilibrium of current-carrying magnetic fields (e.g. flux tubes) embedded in a large-scale
background field is developed and discussed in the astrophysical context. Embedded non-force-free
current-carrying fields require a minimum surrounding atmosphere, which by direct pressure balance
has a gas pressure everywhere proportional to the background magnetic pressure. Formally, the
MHD equations, with flows and gravity as part of a wide class of physical processes, separate into
independent local and global relations representing an equilibrium solution for embedded current-carrying
fields. The local pressure relation for the embedded field is a 3D Grad-Shafranov equation with
finite-sheath solutions. The global relation reproduces the ambient MHD pressure equation without
the embedded fields, but instead with the constraint that the ambient gas and magnetic pressures
vary in proportion, as with the direct pressure balance. A coupled gas pressure in magnetically
dominant regimes necessitates refilling outflows in a depleted atmosphere (actualized by flux-tube
Lorentz forces) providing a compressively heated equilibrium corona with a specific global distribution
of density, temperature, and steady accelerated outflow, all defined by the large-scale background
magnetic field. Magnetic footpoint compression and twisting in a high-gas-pressure field-forming
region (e.g. convection zone) outside, as below, the magnetically dominant regime, can introduce
and sustain non-force-free embedded fields, thereby providing the energy for the coronal atmosphere.
Such coronae may be relevant on very different astrophysical scales: around the sun and stars, and
ranging from planets, to neutron stars, black holes, and spiral galaxies. Predicted coronal temperatures
are corroborated.
