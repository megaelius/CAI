We report on results of an observing campaign to support the Juno mission. At the beginning of 2016,
using TEXES (Texas Echelon cross-dispersed Echelle Spectrograph), mounted on the NASA Infrared
Telescope Facility (IRTF), we obtained data cubes of Jupiter in the 1930--1943 cm$^{-1}$ spectral
ranges (around 5 $\mu$m), which probe the atmosphere in the 1--4 bar region, with a spectral resolution
of $\approx$ 0.15 cm$^{-1}$ and an angular resolution of $\approx$ 1.4". This dataset is analysed
by a code that combines a line-by-line radiative transfer model with a non-linear optimal estimation
inversion method. The inversion retrieves the vertical abundance profiles of NH$_3$ - which is
the main contributor at these wavelengths - with a maximum sensitivity at $\approx$ 1--3 bar, as
well as the cloud transmittance. This retrieval is performed on over more than one thousand pixels
of our data cubes, producing maps of the disk, where all the major belts are visible. We present our
retrieved NH$_3$ abundance maps which can be compared with the distribution observed by Juno's
MWR (Bolton et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017) in the 2 bar region and discuss their significance for the
understanding of Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics. We are able to show important latitudinal variations
- such as in the North Equatorial Belt (NEB), where the NH$_3$ abundance is observed to drop down to
60 ppmv at 2 bar - as well as longitudinal variability. In the zones, we find the NH$_3$ abundance to
increase with depth, from 100 $\pm$ 15 ppmv at 1 bar to 500 $\pm$ 30 ppmv at 3 bar. We also display the
cloud transmittance--NH$_3$ abundance relationship, and find different behaviour for the NEB,
the other belts and the zones. Using a simple cloud model, we are able to fit this relationship, at
least in the NEB, including either NH$_3$-ice or NH$_4$SH particles with sizes between 10 and 100
$\mu$m.
