All cool stars show magnetic activity, and X-ray emission is the hallmark of this activity. Gaining
an understanding of activity aids us in answering fundamental questions about stellar astrophysics
and in determining the impact of activity on the exoplanets that orbit these stars. Stellar activity
is driven by magnetic fields, which are ultimately powered by convection and stellar rotation.
However, the resulting dynamo properties heavily depend on the stellar interior structure and
are far from being understood. X-ray radiation can evaporate exoplanet atmospheres and damage
organic materials on the planetary surface, reducing the probability that life can form or be sustained,
but also provides an important source of energy for prebiotic chemical reactions. Over the next
two years, the TESS mission will deliver a catalog of the closest exoplanets, along with rotation
periods and activity diagnostics for millions of stars, whether or not they have a planet. We propose
to include all cool stars that are TESS targets and bright enough for Chandra observations, as determined
by their detection and flux in the ROSAT all-sky survey (RASS), to the list of Chandra Cool Attitude
Targets (CATs). For each target, the signal will be sufficient to fit the coronal plasma with at least
two temperature components, and compare abundances of groups of elements with low, medium, or high
first ionization potential. Similar to the known relation between X-ray luminosity $L_X$ and rotation
period, we can correlate stellar properties with coronal temperatures and abundances to constrain
models for stellar activity, coronal heating, and stellar dynamos. Detailed X-ray characterization
for even a subset of planet-hosting systems would dramatically advance our knowledge of what impact
these emissions have on orbiting planets.
