We analyzed 29 pairs of time series in B and V bands of the recurrent nova RS Oph. The observations were
carried out in 2008-2017 with duration 0.6 - 3.6 hours, with time resolution 0.5 - 3.3 min. We scanned
digitally each series by data windows with various sizes Theta and derived two of the simplest fractal
parameters for every Theta - standard deviation D and structural deviation S. Using the local minima
of the structural function log S = f_S(log Theta) we unveiled 80 time structures, 42 in B band and 38
in V band, with time sizes 10-120 min. About 3/4 of the time sizes belong to the interval 10-40 min and
about 1/4 lie in the interval 60-120 min. The respective cycles per day are 144-36 c/d and 24-15 c/d.
On logarithmic scale, the distribution of the time sizes shows maximums at about 10, 21, 36 and 74
min. The 10 min flickering is poorly detectable in our series and we found the most widespread time
structures (in about 1/5 of the cases) have time sizes about 21 min (about 69 c/d). Using the deviation
function log D = f_D(log Theta) we estimated the relative cumulative energy (including the energy
of the shorter structures in it), associated with the detected structure sizes, to be in the interval
of the relative fluxes 2-11 %. The energies correlate weakly with the logarithms of the structure
sizes, with correlation coefficients 0.60 and 0.57, under slope coefficients 0.04 and 0.03 in B
and V band, respectively. The distributions of the energies occur bimodal, with maximums about
4% and 6% in B band, as well as about 3% and 5% in V band. The left and right modes of the distributions
may be associated with the structure sizes 10 - 21 min and 37 - 74 min, respectively.
