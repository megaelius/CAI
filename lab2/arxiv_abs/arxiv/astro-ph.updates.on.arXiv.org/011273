HD 62658 (B9p V) is a little-studied chemically peculiar star. Light curves obtained by the Kilodegree
Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) show clear
eclipses with a period of about 4.75 d, as well as out-of-eclipse brightness modulation with the
same 4.75 d period, consistent with synchronized rotational modulation of surface chemical spots.
High-resolution ESPaDOnS circular spectropolarimetry shows a clear Zeeman signature in the line
profile of the primary; there is no indication of a magnetic field in the secondary. PHOEBE modelling
of the light curve and radial velocities indicates that the two components have almost identical
masses of about 3 M$_\odot$. The primary's longitudinal magnetic field $\langle B_z \rangle$ varies
between about $+100$ and $-250$ G, suggesting a surface magnetic dipole strength $B_{\rm d} = 850$~G.
Bayesian analysis of the Stokes $V$ profiles indicates $B_{\rm d} = 650$~G for the primary and $B_{\rm
d} < 110$ G for the secondary. The primary's line profiles are highly variable, consistent with the
hypothesis that the out-of-eclipse brightness modulation is a consequence of rotational modulation
of that star's chemical spots. We also detect a residual signal in the light curve after removal of
the orbital and rotational modulations, which might be pulsational in origin; this could be consistent
with the weak line profile variability of the secondary. This system represents an excellent opportunity
to examine the consequences of magnetic fields for stellar structure via comparison of two stars
that are essentially identical with the exception that one is magnetic. The existence of such a system
furthermore suggests that purely environmental explanations for the origin of fossil magnetic
fields are incomplete.
