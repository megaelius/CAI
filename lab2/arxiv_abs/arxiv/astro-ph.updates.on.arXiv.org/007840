Observations of radio emission in about 10 per cent of ultra-cool dwarfs (UCDs) indicate the presence
of strong, persistent magnetic fields in these stars. These results are in contrast to early theoretical
expectations on fully-convective dynamos, and to other tracers of magnetic activity, such as H
{\alpha} and X-ray luminosity. Radio-frequency observations have been key to physically characterising
UCD magnetospheres, although explaining the diverse behaviour within them remains challenging.
Most radio-frequency studies of UCDs have been conducted in the 4-8 GHz band, where traditional
radio interferometers are typically most sensitive. Hence, the nature of UCD radio emission at
low frequencies ($\lesssim 1.4\,\mathrm{GHz}$) remains relatively unexplored, but can probe
optically thick emission, and regions of lower magnetic field strengths -- regimes not accessible
to higher-frequency observations. In this work, we present the results from Giant Metrewave Radio
Telescope observations of nine UCDs taken at $\sim 610$ and $1300\,\mathrm{MHz}$. These are the
first observations of UCDs in this frequency range to be published in the literature. Using these
observations, we are able to constrain the coronal magnetic field strength and electron number
density of one of the targets to $1 \lesssim B \lesssim 90\,\mathrm{G}$ and $4 \lesssim \log(N_e)
\lesssim 10$, respectively. We do not detect the flaring emission observed at higher frequencies,
to a limit of a few millijanskys. These results show that some UCDs can produce low-frequency radio
emission, and highlights the need for simultaneous multi-wavelength radio observations to tightly
constrain the coronal and magnetospheric properties of these stars.
