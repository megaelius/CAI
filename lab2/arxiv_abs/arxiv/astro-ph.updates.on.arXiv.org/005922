Recently, Will calculated an additional contribution to the Mercury's precession of the longitude
of perihelion $\varpi$ of the order of $\dot\varpi_\textrm{W}\simeq 0.22$ $\textrm{milliarcseconds
per century}$ ($\textrm{mas cty}^{-1}$). To a level which is not explicitly quantified, $\dot\varpi_\textrm{W}$
is partly a direct consequence of certain 1pN third-body accelerations entering the planetary
equations of motion, and partly an indirect, mixed effect due to the simultaneous interplay of the
standard 1pN pointlike acceleration of the primary with the Newtonian $N$-body acceleration,
to the quadrupole order, in the analytical calculation of the secular perihelion precession with
the Gauss equations. We critically discuss the actual measurability of the mixed effects with respect
to direct ones. The current uncertainties in either the magnitude of the Sun's angular momentum
$S_\odot$ and the orientation of its spin axis ${\boldsymbol{\hat{S}}}_\odot$ impact the precessions
$\dot\varpi_{J_2^\odot},~\dot\varpi_\textrm{LT}$ induced by the Sun's quadrupole mass moment
and angular momentum via the Lense-Thirring effect to a level which makes almost impossible to measure
$\dot\varpi_\textrm{W}$ even in the hypothesis that it comes entirely from the aforementioned
1pN third-body accelerations. On the other hand, from the point of view of the Lense-Thirring effect
itself, the mismodeled quadrupolar precession $\delta\dot\varpi_{J_2^\odot}$ due to the uncertainties
in ${\boldsymbol{\hat{S}}}_\odot$ corresponds to a bias of $\simeq 9\%$ of the relativistic one.
The resulting simulated mismodeled range and range-rate times series of BepiColombo are at about
the per cent level of the nominal gravitomagnetic ones.
