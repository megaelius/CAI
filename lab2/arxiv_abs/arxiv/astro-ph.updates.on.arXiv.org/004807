WASP-18 hosts a massive, very close-in Jupiter-like planet. Despite its young age ($<$1 Gyr), the
star presents an anomalously low stellar activity level: the measured logR'$_{\rm HK}$ activity
parameter lies slightly below the basal level; there is no significant time-variability in the
logR'$_{\rm HK}$ value; there is no detection of the star in the X-rays. We present results of far-UV
observations of WASP-18 obtained with COS on board of Hubble Space Telescope aimed at explaining
this anomaly. From the star's spectral energy distribution, we infer the extinction (E(B-V) $\approx$
0.01 mag) and then the interstellar medium (ISM) column density for a number of ions, concluding
that ISM absorption is not the origin of the anomaly. We measure the flux of the four stellar emission
features detected in the COS spectrum (CII, CIII, CIV, SiIV). Comparing the CII/CIV flux ratio measured
for WASP-18 with that derived from spectra of nearby stars with known age, we see that the far-UV spectrum
of WASP-18 resembles that of old ($>$5 Gyr), inactive stars, in stark contrast with its young age.
We conclude that WASP-18 has an intrinsically low activity level, possibly caused by star-planet
tidal interaction, as suggested by previous studies. Re-scaling the solar irradiance reference
spectrum to match the flux of the SiIV line, yields an XUV integrated flux at the planet orbit of 10.2
erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. We employ the rescaled XUV solar fluxes to models of the planetary upper
atmosphere, deriving an extremely low thermal mass-loss rate of 10$^{-20}$ $M_{\rm J}$ Gyr$^{-1}$.
For such high-mass planets, thermal escape is not energy limited, but driven by Jeans escape.
