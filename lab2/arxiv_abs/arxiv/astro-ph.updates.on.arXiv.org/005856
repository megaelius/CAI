We investigate the relationships between Mg ii {\lambda}2798 emission line properties, as well
as between these properties and inclination angle and Fe ii strength, in a lobe-dominated quasar
sample. We find no correlation between Mg ii line width and inclination, unlike previous studies
of the general quasar population. This suggests that the Mg ii emission region in these objects is
not of a thin disk geometry, however the average equivalent width of the line negates a spherical
alternative. A positive correlation between Mg ii equivalent width and inclination cannot be ruled
out, meaning there is no strong evidence that Mg ii emission is anisotropic. Since thin disk emission
would be highly directional, the geometric implications of these two findings are compatible.
The lack of line width correlation with inclination may also indicate that Mg ii is useful for estimating
black hole masses in lobe-dominated quasar samples, since it is unbiased by orientation. Some quasars
in our sample have almost edge-on viewing angles and therefore cannot have a smooth toroidal obscurer
co-planar with the accretion disk. Alternatives may be a distorted dusty disk or a clumpy obscurer.
This could result from the sample selection bias towards high inclination objects, rather than
intrinsic differences between lobe-dominated and typical quasars. Five objects have visible
[O iii] allowing equivalent width calculation, revealing it to be higher than in typical quasars.
Since these objects are of high inclination, this finding supports the positive correlation between
[O iii] equivalent width and inclination found in a previous study.
