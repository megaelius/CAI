The Chinese satellite Wukong, also known as the DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) experiment,
has released its observation data of the cosmic ray (CR) electrons and positrons, which shows an
excess in the energy spectrum up to TeV energy, and possibly a peak-like structure at 1.4 TeV. We investigate
the scenario that the source of the excess come from the annihilation or decay of dark matter. We consider
the W$^+$W$^-$ channel and direct $e^+e^-$ channel (model A), and the double $\tau^+\tau^-$ channel
and direct $e^+e^-$ channel (model B). We find that the annihilation or decay of dark matter in the
galactic halo can give excellent fits to the broad excess. However, the annihilation cross section
is of the order of $10^{-23} \cm^3 s^{-1}$, larger than required for obtaining the correct relic
abundance. We then study whether the narrow peak at 1.4 TeV could be explained by a nearby subhalo,
which thanks to the smaller distance, could supply $e^+e^-$ within a narrow energy range. We find
that in order to produce a peak width less than the DAMPE energy bin width (0.2 TeV), the source must
be located within $r< 0.6 \kpc$. Our global fit models do not produce the peak-like feature, instead
at 1.4 TeV the spectrum show either a slope or a cliff-like feature. However, if less than optimal
fit is allowed, the peak-like feature could be generated. Furthermore, an excellent fit with peak
could be obtained with model B if the background is rescaled. If the dark matter decay and annihilation
rates are determined using the broad excess, we find that the halo is too heavy ($10^9 \Msun$) in the
decay model, while for annihilation model a steep profile is required to avoid having very heavy
ones. The halo can be searched or constrained by $\gamma$-ray photons from the inverse Compton scattering
of its electrons.
