We assess the status of big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) in light of the final Planck data release
and other recent developments, and in anticipation of future measurements. Planck data fix the
cosmic baryon density to 0.9% precision, and determine the helium abundance and effective number
of neutrinos with precision approaching that of astronomical and BBN determinations respectively.
In addition, new high-redshift measurements give D/H to better precision than theoretical predictions,
and new Li/H data reconfirm the lithium problem. We present new ${}^{7}{\rm Be}(n,p){}^{7}{\rm
Li}$ rates using new neutron capture measurements; we have also examined the effect of proposed
changes in the $d(p,\gamma){}^{3}{\rm He}$ rates. Using these results we perform a series of likelihood
analyses. We assess BBN/CMB consistency, with attention to how our results depend on the choice
of Planck data, as well as how the results depend on the choice of non-BBN, non-Planck data sets. Most
importantly the lithium problem remains, and indeed is more acute given the very tight D/H observational
constraints; new neutron capture data reveals systematics that somewhat increases uncertainty
and thus slightly reduces but does not essentially change the problem. We confirm that $d(p,\gamma){}^{3}{\rm
He}$ theoretical rates brings D/H out of agreement and slightly increases 7Li; new experimental
data are needed at BBN energies. Setting the lithium problem aside, we find the effective number
of neutrino species at BBN is $N_\nu = 2.86 \pm 0.15$. Future CMB Stage-4 measurements promise substantial
improvements in BBN parameters: helium abundance determinations will be competitive with the
best astronomical determinations, and $N_{\rm eff}$ will approach sensitivities capable of detecting
the effects of Standard Model neutrino heating of the primordial plasma. (Abridged)
