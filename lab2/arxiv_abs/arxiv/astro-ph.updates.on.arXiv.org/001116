Optical integral-field spectroscopy was used to investigate the planetary nebula NGC 3242. We
analysed the main morphological components of this source, including its knots, but not the halo.
In addition to revealing the properties ofthe physical and chemical nature of this nebula, we also
provided reliable spatially resolved constraints that can be used for future photoionisation
modelling of the nebula. The latter is ultimately necessary to obtain a fully self-consistent 3D
picture of the physical and chemical properties of the object. The observations were obtained with
the VIMOS instrument attached to VLT-UT3. Maps and values for specific morphological zones for
the detected emission-lines were obtained and analysed with routines developed by the authors
to derive physical and chemical conditions of the ionised gas in a 2D fashion. We obtained spatially
resolved maps and mean values of the electron densities, temperatures, and chemical abundances,
for specific morphological structures in NGC~3242. These results show the pixel-to-pixel variations
of the the small- and large-scale structures of the source. These diagnostic maps provide information
free from the biases introduced by traditional single long-slit observations. In general, our
results are consistent with a uniform abundance distribution for the object, whether we look at
abundance maps or integrated fluxes from specified morphological structures. The results indicate
that special care should be taken with the calibration of the data and that only data with extremely
good signal-to-noise ratio and spectral coverage should be used to ensure the detection of possible
spatial variations.
