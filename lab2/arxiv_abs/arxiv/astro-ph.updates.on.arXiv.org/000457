We present the results on the study of the global and local M-Z relation based on the first data available
from the CALIFA survey (150 galaxies). This survey provides integral field spectroscopy of the
complete optical extent of each galaxy (up to 2-3 effective radii), with enough resolution to separate
individual HII regions and/or aggregations. Nearly $\sim$3000 individual HII regions have been
detected. The spectra cover the wavelength range between [OII]3727 and [SII]6731, with a sufficient
signal-to-noise to derive the oxygen abundance and star-formation rate associated with each region.
In addition, we have computed the integrated and spatially resolved stellar masses (and surface
densities), based on SDSS photometric data. We explore the relations between the stellar mass,
oxygen abundance and star-formation rate using this dataset. We derive a tight relation between
the integrated stellar mass and the gas-phase abundance, with a dispersion smaller than the one
already reported in the literature ($\sigma_{\Delta{\rm log(O/H)}}=$0.07 dex). Indeed, this
dispersion is only slightly larger than the typical error derived for our oxygen abundances. However,
we do not find any secondary relation with the star-formation rate, other than the one induced due
to the primary relation of this quantity with the stellar mass. We confirm the result using the $\sim$3000
individual HII regions, for the corresponding local relations. Our results agree with the scenario
in which gas recycling in galaxies, both locally and globally, is much faster than other typical
timescales, like that of gas accretion by inflow and/or metal loss due to outflows. In essence, late-type/disk
dominated galaxies seem to be in a quasi-steady situation, with a behavior similar to the one expected
from an instantaneous recycling/closed-box model.
