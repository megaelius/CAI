In this work, we investigate the reliability of the BPT diagram for excluding the galaxies that host
an AGN. Specifically, we determine the prevalence of X-ray AGN in the star-forming region of the
BPT diagram and discuss the reasons behind this apparent misclassification. X-ray AGN are selected
from very deep XMM observations using a new method that results in greater samples with a wider range
of X-ray luminosities, complete to $\log(L_{X})>41$ for $z<0.3$. Taking X-ray detectability
into account, we find that the fraction of X-ray AGN in the star-forming branch of the BPT diagram
is 2% on average, suggesting that optical emission-line selection via the BPT diagram can provide
a reasonably clean sample of star-forming galaxies. However, the X-ray selection is itself rather
incomplete. At the tip of the AGN branch of the BPT diagram, the X-ray AGN fraction is only ~15%, likely
due to the obscurationx of X-rays. This has implications for high-redshift studies that exclude
AGN based only on X-ray observations. Interestingly, the X-ray AGN fractions are similar for Seyfert
and LINER populations, consistent with LINERs being true AGN. We find that neither the star-formation
dilution nor hidden broad-line components can satisfactorily explain the apparent misclassification
of X-ray AGN in the star-forming region of the BPT diagram. On the other hand, ~40% of all X-ray AGN
have very weak emission lines such that they cannot be placed on the BPT diagram at all. They also tend
to have very low specific SFRs. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the X-ray AGN found in
the star-forming region of the BPT diagram is that they have intrinsically weak AGN lines, and are
only classifiable by the BPT diagram when they tend to have high specific SFRs.
