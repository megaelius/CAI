The HH 212 protostellar system, in Orion B, has been mapped thanks to ALMA-Band 7 Cycle 1 and Cycle
4 observations of dueterated water (HDO) and acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO) emission with an angular
resolution down to $\sim$0.15 arcsec (60 au). Many emission lines due to 14 CH$_3$CHO and 1 HDO transitions
at high excitation ($E_{\rm u}$ between 163 K and 335 K) have been imaged in the inner $\sim$ 70 au region.
The local thermal equilibrium analysis of the CH$_3$CHO emission leads to a temperature of 78$\pm$14
K and a column density of 7.6$\pm$3.2 $\times$ 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$, which, when $N_{\rm H_2}$ of
10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$ is assumed, leads to an abundance of $X_{\rm CH_3CHO}$ $\simeq$ 8 $\times$
10$^{-9}$. The large velocity gradient analysis of the HDO emission also places severe constraints
on the volume density, n$_{\rm H_2}$ $\geq$ 10$^8$ cm$^{-3}$. The line profiles are 5--7 km s$^{-1}$
wide, and CH$_3$CHO and HDO both show a $\pm$ 2 km s$^{-1}$ velocity gradient over a size of $\sim$
70 au (blue-shifted emission towards the north-west and red-shifted emission towards the south-east)
along the disc equatorial plane, in agreement with what was found so far using other molecular tracers.
The kinematics of CH$_3$CHO and HDO are consistent with the occurrence of a centrifugal barrier,
that is, the infalling envelope-rotating disc ring, which is chemically enriched through low-velocity
accretion shocks. The emission radius is $\sim$ 60 au, in good agreement with what was found before
for another interstellar complex organic molecule such as NH$_2$CHO. We support a vertical structure
for the centrifugal barrier, suggesting the occurrence of two outflowing, expanding, and rotating
rings above and below (of about 40-45 au) the optically thick equatorial disc plane. It is tempting
to speculate that these rings could probe the basis of a wind launched from this region.
