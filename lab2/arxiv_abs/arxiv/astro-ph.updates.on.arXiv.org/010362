Modeling the dynamics of most astrophysical structures requires an adequate description of the
radiation-matter interaction. Several numerical (magneto)hydrodynamics codes were upgraded
with a radiation module to fulfill this request. However, those among them that use either the flux-limited
diffusion (FLD) or the M1 radiation moment approaches are restricted to the local thermodynamic
equilibrium (LTE). This assumption may be not valid in some astrophysical cases. We present an upgraded
version of the LTE radiation-hydrodynamics module implemented in the PLUTO code, originally developed
by Kolb et al. (2013), which we have extended to handle non-LTE regimes. Starting from the general
frequency-integrated comoving-frame equations of radiation hydrodynamics (RHD), we have justified
all the assumptions made to obtain the non-LTE equations actually implemented in the module, under
the FLD approximation. An operator-split method is employed, with two substeps: the hydrodynamic
part is solved with an explicit method by the solvers already available in PLUTO, the non-LTE radiation
diffusion and energy exchange part is solved with an implicit method. The module is implemented
in the PLUTO environment. It uses databases of radiative quantities that can be provided independently
by the user: the radiative power loss, the Planck and Rosseland mean opacities. Our implementation
has been validated through different tests, in particular radiative shock tests. The agreement
with the semi-analytical solutions (when available) is good, with a maximum error of 7%. Moreover,
we have proved that non-LTE approach is of paramount importance to properly model accretion shock
structures. Our radiation FLD module represents a step toward the general non-LTE RHD modeling.
The module is available, under request, for the community.
