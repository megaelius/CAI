The matching of sources between photometric catalogues can lead to cases where objects of differing
brightness are incorrectly assumed to be detections of the same source. The rejection of unphysical
matches can be achieved through the inclusion of information about the sources' magnitudes. The
method described here uses the additional photometric information from both catalogues in the
process of accepting or rejecting counterparts, providing approximately a factor 10 improvement
in Bayes' factor with its inclusion. When folding in the photometric information we avoid using
prior astrophysical knowledge. Additionally, the method allows for the possibility of no counterparts
to sources as well as the possibility that sources overlap multiple potential counterparts. We
formally describe the probability of two sources being the same astrometric object, allowing systematic
effects of astrometric perturbation (by, e.g., contaminant objects) to be accounted for. We apply
the method to two cases. First, we test IPHAS-Gaia matches to compare the resulting matches in two
catalogues of similar wavelength coverage but differing dynamical ranges. Second, we apply the
method to matches between IPHAS and 2MASS and show that the method holds when considering two catalogues
with approximately equal astrometric precision. We discuss the importance of including the magnitude
information in each case. Additionally, we discuss extending the method to multiple catalogue
matches through an iterative matching process. The method allows for the selection of high-quality
matches by providing an overall probability for each pairing, giving the flexibility to choose
stars known to be good matches.
