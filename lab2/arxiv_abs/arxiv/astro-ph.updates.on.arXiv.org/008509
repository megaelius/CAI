We propose a formation mechanism for twin blue stragglers (BSs) in compact binaries that involves
mass transfer from an evolved outer tertiary companion on to the inner binary via a circumbinary
disk. We apply this scenario to the observed double BS system Binary 7782 in the old open cluster NGC
188, and show that its observed properties are naturally reproduced within the context of the proposed
model. We predict the following properties for twin BSs: (1) For the outer tertiary orbit, the initial
orbital period should lie between 220 days $\lesssim$ P$_{\rm out}$ $\lesssim$ 1100 days, assuming
initial masses for the inner binary components of $m_{\rm 1} = 1.1$ M$_{\odot}$ and $m_{\rm 2} =$
0.9 M$_{\odot}$ and an outer tertiary mass of $m_{\rm 3} = 1.4$ M$_{\odot}$. After Roche-lobe overflow,
the outer star turns into a white dwarf (WD) of mass 0.43 to 0.54\,\MSun. There is a correlation between
the mass of this WD and the outer orbital period: more massive WDs will be on wider orbits. (3) The rotational
axes of both BSs will be aligned with each other and the orbital plane of the outer tertiary WD. (4)
The BSs will have roughly equal masses, independent of their initial masses (since the lower mass
star accretes the most). The dominant accretor should, therefore, be more enriched by the accreted
material. Hence, one of the BSs will appear to be more enriched by either He, C and O or by s-process
elements, if the donor started Roche lobe overflow on, respectively, the red giant or asymptotic
giant branch. (5) Relative to old clusters, twin BSs in close binaries formed from the proposed mechanism
should be more frequent in the Galactic field and open clusters with ages $\lesssim$ 4-6 Gyr, since
then the donor will have a radiative envelope. (6) The orbit of the binary BS will have a small semi-major
axis (typically $\aplt 0.3$\,au) and be close to circular ($e \aplt 0.2$).
