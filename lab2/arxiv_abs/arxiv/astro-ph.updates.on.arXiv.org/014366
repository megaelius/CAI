Small satellite platforms with high performance avionics are becoming more affordable. So far,
with a few exceptions, small satellites have been mainly dedicated to earth observation. However,
astronomy is a fascinating field with a history of large missions and a future of promising large
mission candidates. This prompts many questions; can the recent affordability of small satellites
change the landscape of space astronomy? What are the potential applications and scientific topics
of interest, where small satellites could be instrumental for astronomy? What are the requirements
and objectives that need to be fulfilled to successfully address the astronomical investigations
of interest? Which kind of instrumentation suits the small platforms and the scientific use cases
best? This paper discusses possible scientific use cases that can be achievable with a relatively
small telescope aperture of 36 cm, as an example. The result of this survey points to a specific niche
market -astronomy observation in the UV spectral range. UV astronomy is a research field which has
had valuable scientific impact. It is, however, not the focus of many current or past astronomical
investigations. UV astronomy measurements cannot be made from earth, due to atmospheric absorption
in this spectral range. The research field is currently sparsely addressed but of scientific interest
for a large community. Small satellites offer the opportunity to provide more means of research
for UV astronomy. Therefore, this paper also presents an instrument design with a modest telescope
aperture, a spectrometer and a detector that is suitable for observations in the UV. The observatory
design can be accommodated on small platforms for the selected scientific use cases. It fulfills
the scientific objectives and requirements of those use cases.
