$\textit{Aims.}$ We present a case study to demonstrate the potential of multi-wavelength polarization
measurements. The aim is to investigate the effects that dichroic polarization and thermal re-emission
have on tracing the magnetic field in the interstellar medium (ISM). Furthermore, we analyze the
crucial influence of imperfectly aligned compact dust grains on the resulting synthetic continuum
polarization maps.$\\ \textit{Methods.}$ We developed an extended version of the well-known
3D Monte-Carlo radiation transport code MC3D for multi-wavelength polarization simulations
running on an adaptive grid.We investigated the interplay between radiation, magnetic fields
and dust grains. Our results were produced by post-processing both ideal density distributions
and sophisticated magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) collapse simulations with radiative transfer simulations.
We derived spatially resolved maps of intensity, optical depth, and linear and circular polarization
at various inclination angles and scales in a wavelength range from 7 $\mu m$ to 1 $mm$.$\\ \textit{Results.}$
We predict unique patterns in linear and circular polarization maps for different types of density
distributions and magnetic field morphologies for test setups and sophisticated MHD collapse
simulations. We show that alignment processes of interstellar dust grains can significantly influence
the resulting synthetic polarization maps. Multi-wavelength polarization measurements allow
one to predict the morphology of the magnetic field inside the ISM. The interpretation of polarization
measurements of complex structures still remains ambiguous because of the large variety of the
predominant parameters in the ISM.
