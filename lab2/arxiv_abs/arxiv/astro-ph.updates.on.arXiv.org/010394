We investigate the geometric distribution of gas metallicities in the circumgalactic medium (CGM)
around $47$, $z<0.7$ galaxies from the "Multiphase Galaxy Halos" Survey. Using a combination of
quasar spectra from HST/COS and from Keck/HIRES or VLT/UVES we measure column densities of, or determine
limits on, CGM absorption lines. We then use a Monte-Carlo Markov chain approach with Cloudy to estimate
the metallicity of cool (T$\sim$$10^4$K) CGM gas. We also use HST images to determine host galaxy
inclination and quasar--galaxy azimuthal angles. Our sample spans a HI column density range of
$13.8$ cm s$^{-1}<{\log N_{HI}}<19.9$ cm s$^{-1}$. We find (1) while the metallicity distribution
appears bimodal, a Hartigan dip test cannot rule out a unimodal distribution ($0.4\sigma$). (2)
CGM metallicities are independent of halo mass, spanning three orders of magnitude at fixed halo
mass. (3) The CGM metallicity does not depend on the galaxy azimuthal and inclination angles regardless
of HI column density, impact parameter and galaxy color. (4) Ionization parameter does not depend
on azimuthal angle. We suggest that the partial Lyman limit metallicity bimodality is not driven
by a spatial azimuthal bimodality. Our results are consistent with simulations where the CGM is
complex and outflowing, accreting, and recycled gas are well-homogenized at $z<0.7$. The presence
of low metallicity gas at all orientations suggests that cold streams of accreting filaments are
not necessarily aligned with the galaxy plane at low redshifts or intergalactic transfer may dominate.
Finally, our results support simulations showing that strong metal absorption can mask the presence
of low metallicity gas in integrated line-of-sight CGM metallicities.
