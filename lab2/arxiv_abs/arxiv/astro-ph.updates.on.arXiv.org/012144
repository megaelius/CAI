Data from transit light curves, radial velocity and transit timing observations can be used to probe
the interiors of exoplanets beyond the mean density, by measuring the Love numbers $h_2$ and $k_2$.
The first indirect estimate of $k_2$ for an exoplanet from radial velocity and transit timing variations
observations has been performed by taking advantage of the years-spanning baseline. Not a single
measurement of $h_2$ has been achieved from transit light curves, mostly because the photometric
precision of current observing facilities is still too low. We show that the Imaging Spectrograph
instrument on-board the Hubble Space Telescope could measure $h_2$ of the hot Jupiter WASP-121b
if only few more observations were gathered. We show that a careful treatment of the noise and stellar
limb darkening must be carried out to achieve a measurement of $h_2$. In particular, we find that
the impact of the noise modelling on the estimation of $h_2$ is stronger than the impact of the limb
darkening modelling. In addition, we emphasize that the wavelet method for correlated noise analysis
can mask limb brightening. Finally, using presently available data, we briefly discuss the tentative
measurement of $h_2 = 1.39^{+0.71}_{-0.81}$ in terms of interior structure. Additional observations
would further constrain the interior of WASP-121b and possibly provide insights on the physics
of inflation. The possibility of using the approach presented here with the Hubble Space Telescope
provides a bridge before the high-quality data to be returned by the James Webb Space Telescope and
PLATO telescope in the coming decade.
