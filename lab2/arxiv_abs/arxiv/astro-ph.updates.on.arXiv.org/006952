An accurate estimate of the inner edge of the habitable zone is critical for determining which exoplanets
are potentially habitable and for designing future telescopes to observe them. Here, we explore
differences in estimating the inner edge among seven one-dimensional (1D) radiative transfer
models: two line-by-line codes (SMART and LBLRTM) as well as five band codes (CAM3, CAM4_Wolf, LMDG,
SBDART, and AM2) that are currently being used in global climate models. We compare radiative fluxes
and spectra in clear-sky conditions around G- and M-stars, with fixed moist adiabatic profiles
for surface temperatures from 250 to 360 K. We find that divergences among the models arise mainly
from large uncertainties in water vapor absorption in the window region (10 um) and in the region
between 0.2 and 1.5 um. Differences in outgoing longwave radiation increase with surface temperature
and reach 10-20 Wm^-2; differences in shortwave reach up to 60 Wm^-2, especially at the surface and
in the troposphere, and are larger for an M-dwarf spectrum than a solar spectrum. Differences between
the two line-by-line models are significant, although smaller than among the band models. Our results
imply that the uncertainty in estimating the insolation threshold of the inner edge (the runaway
greenhouse limit) due only to clear-sky radiative transfer is ~10% of modern Earth's solar constant
(i.e., ~34 Wm^-2 in global mean) among band models and ~3% between the two line-by-line models. These
comparisons show that future work is needed focusing on improving water vapor absorption coefficients
in both shortwave and longwave, as well as on increasing the resolution of stellar spectra in broadband
models.
