The cosmic-ray Sun shadow, which is caused by high-energy charged cosmic rays being blocked and
deflected by the Sun and its magnetic field, has been observed by various experiments such as Argo-YBJ,
HAWC, Tibet, and IceCube. Most notably, the shadow's size and depth was recently shown to correlate
with the 11-year solar cycle. The interpretation of such measurements, which help to bridge the
gap between solar physics and high-energy particle astrophysics, requires a solid theoretical
understanding of cosmic-ray propagation in the coronal magnetic field. It is the aim of this paper
to establish theoretical predictions for the cosmic-ray Sun shadow in order to identify observables
that can be used to study this link in more detail. To determine the cosmic-ray Sun shadow, we numerically
compute trajectories of charged cosmic rays in the energy range of 5 to 316 TeV for five different
mass numbers. We present and analyse the resulting shadow images for protons and iron, as well as
for typically measured cosmic-ray compositions. We confirm the observationally established
correlation between the magnitude of the shadowing effect and both the mean sunspot number and the
polarity of the magnetic field during the solar cycle. We also show that during low solar activity,
the Sun's shadow behaves similarly to that of a dipole, for which we find a non-monotonous dependence
on energy. In particular, the shadow can become significantly more pronounced than the geometrical
disk expected for a totally unmagnetized Sun. For times of high solar activity, we instead predict
the shadow to depend monotonously on energy, and to be generally weaker than the geometrical shadow
for all tested energies. These effects should become visible in energy-resolved measurements
of the Sun shadow, and may in the future become an independent measure for the level of disorder in
the solar magnetic field.
