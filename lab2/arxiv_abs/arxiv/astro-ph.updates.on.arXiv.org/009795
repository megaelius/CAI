The GLOSTAR survey will study the star formation in the Galactic plane between $-2^{\circ}< \textit{l}<
85^{\circ}$ and $|b| < 1^{\circ}$ with unprecedented sensitivity in both, flux density ($\sim$
40 $\mu Jy$ beam$^{-1}$) and range of angular scales ($\sim$ 1."5 to the largest radio structures
in the Galaxy). In this paper we present the first results obtained from a radio continuum map of a
16 square degree sized region of the Galactic plane centered on $\textit{l} = 32^{\circ}$ and $b
= 0^{\circ}$ ($28^{\circ} < \textit{l} < 36^{\circ}$ and $|b| < 1^{\circ}$). This map has a resolution
of 18" and sensitivity of $\sim$ 60-150 $\mu Jy$ beam$^{-1}$. We present data acquired with the VLA
in D-configuration. Two 1 GHz wide sub-bands were observed simultaneously and centred at 4.7 and
6.9 GHz. These data were calibrated and imaged using the $\textit{Obit}$ software package. The
source extraction has been performed using the BLOBCAT software package and verified through a
combination of visual inspection and cross-matching with other radio and mid-infrared surveys.
The final catalog consists of 1575 discrete radio sources and 27 large scale structures (including
W43 and W44). By cross-matching with other catalogs and calculating the spectral indices ($S(\nu)
\propto \nu^\alpha$), we have classified 231 continuum sources as HII regions, 37 as ionization
fronts, and 46 as planetary nebulae. The longitude and latitude distribution and negative spectral
indices are all consistent with the vast majority of the unclassified sources being extragalactic
background sources. We present a catalog of 1575 radio continuum sources and discuss their physical
properties, emission nature and relation with previously reported. These first GLOSTAR results
have increased the number of reliable HII regions in this part of the Galaxy by a factor of four.
