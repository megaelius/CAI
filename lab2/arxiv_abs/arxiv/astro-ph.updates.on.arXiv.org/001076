The bright low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) GX 13+1 is one of the most peculiar Galactic binary systems.
A periodicity of 24.27 d with a formal statistical error of 0.03 d was observed in its power spectrum
density obtained with RXTE All Sky Monitor (ASM) data spanning 14 years. Starting from a recent study,
indicating GX 13+1 as a possible dipping source candidate, we systematically searched for periodic
dips in the X-ray light curves of GX 13+1 from 1996 up to 2013 using RXTE/ASM, and MAXI data to determine
for the first time the X-ray orbital ephemeris of GX 13+1. We searched for a periodic signal in the
ASM and MAXI light curves, finding a common periodicity of 24.53 d. We folded the 1.3-5 keV and 5-12.1
keV ASM light curves and the 2-4 and 4-10 keV MAXI light curves at the period of 24.53 d finding a periodic
dip. To refine the value of the period we used the timing technique dividing the ASM light curve in
eight intervals and the MAXI light curve in two intervals, obtaining four and two dip arrival times
from the ASM and MAXI light curves, respectively. We improved the X-ray position of GX 13+1 using
a recent Chandra observation. The new X-ray position is discrepant by $\sim 7\arcsec$ from the previous
one, while it is compatible with the infrared and radio counterpart positions. We detected an X-ray
dip, that is totally covered by the Chandra observation, in the light curve of GX 13+1 and showed,
a-posteriori, that it is a periodic dip. We obtained seven dip arrival times from ASM, MAXI, and Chandra
light curves. We calculated the delays of the detected dip arrival times with respect to the expected
times for a 24.52 d periodicity. Fitting the delays with a linear function we find that the orbital
period and the epoch of reference of GX 13+1 are 24.5274(2) days and 50,086.79(3) MJD, respectively.(Abridged)
