The SCUBA-2 Ultra Deep Imaging EAO Survey (STUDIES) is a three-year JCMT Large Program aiming at
reaching the 450 $\mu$m confusion limit in the COSMOS-CANDELS region, to study a representative
sample of the high-redshift far-infrared galaxy population that gives rise to the bulk of the far-infrared
background. We present the first-year data from STUDIES. We have reached a 450 $\mu$m noise level
of 0.91~mJy for point sources at the map center, covered an area of 151 arcmin$^2$, and detected 98
and 141 sources at 4.0 and 3.5 $\sigma$, respectively. Our derived counts are best constrained in
the 3.5-25 mJy regime using directly detected sources. Below the detection limits, our fluctuation
analysis further constrains the slope of the counts down to 1 mJy. The resulting counts at 1-25 mJy
are consistent with a power law having a slope of $-2.59$ ($\pm0.10$ for 3.5-25 mJy, and $^{+0.4}_{-0.7}$
for 1-3.5 mJy). There is no evidence of a faint-end termination or turn-over of the counts in this
flux density range. Our counts are also consistent with previous SCUBA-2 blank-field and lensing
cluster surveys. The integrated surface brightness from our counts down to 1 mJy is $90.0\pm17.2$
Jy deg$^{-2}$, which can account for up to $83^{+15}_{-16}\%$ of the COBE 450 $\mu$m background.
We show that Herschel counts at 350 and 500 $\mu$m are significantly higher than our 450 $\mu$m counts,
likely caused by its large beam and source clustering. High-angular resolution instruments like
SCUBA-2 at 450 $\mu$m are therefore highly beneficial for measuring the luminosity and spatial
density of high-redshift dusty galaxies.
