The observed mass-radius relationship of low-mass planets informs our understanding of their
composition and evolution. Recent discoveries of low mass, large radii objects ("super-puffs")
have challenged theories of planet formation and atmospheric loss, as their high inferred gas masses
make them vulnerable to runaway accretion and hydrodynamic escape. Here we propose that high altitude
photochemical hazes could enhance the observed radii of low-mass planets and explain the nature
of super-puffs. We construct model atmospheres in radiative-convective equilibrium and compute
rates of atmospheric escape and haze distributions, taking into account haze coagulation, sedimentation,
diffusion, and advection by an outflow wind. We develop mass-radius diagrams that include atmospheric
lifetimes and haze opacity, which is enhanced by the outflow, such that young (~0.1-1 Gyr), warm
(T$_{eq}$ $\geq$ 500 K), low mass objects ($M_c$ < 4M$_{\rm Earth}$) should experience the most
apparent radius enhancement due to hazes, reaching factors of three. This reconciles the densities
and ages of the most extreme super-puffs. For Kepler-51b, the inclusion of hazes reduces its inferred
gas mass fraction to <10%, similar to that of planets on the large radius side of the sub-Neptune radius
gap. This suggests that Kepler-51b may be evolving towards that population, and that some warm sub-Neptunes
may have evolved from super-puffs. Hazes also render transmission spectra of super-puffs and sub-Neptunes
featureless, consistent with recent measurements. Our hypothesis can be tested by future observations
of super-puffs' transmission spectra at mid-infrared wavelengths, where we predict that the planet
radius will be half of that observed in the near-infrared.
