The Multi-slit Solar Explorer (MUSE) is a proposed mission aimed at understanding the physical
mechanisms driving the heating of the solar corona and the eruptions that are at the foundation of
space weather. MUSE contains two instruments, a multi-slit EUV spectrograph and a context imager.
It will simultaneously obtain EUV spectra (along 37 slits) and context images with the highest resolution
in space (0.33-0.4 arcsec) and time (1-4 s) ever achieved for the transition region and corona. The
MUSE science investigation will exploit major advances in numerical modeling, and observe at the
spatial and temporal scales on which competing models make testable and distinguishable predictions,
thereby leading to a breakthrough in our understanding of coronal heating and the drivers of space
weather. By obtaining spectra in 4 bright EUV lines (Fe IX 171A, Fe XV 284A, Fe XIX-XXI 108A) covering
a wide range of transition region and coronal temperatures along 37 slits simultaneously, MUSE
will be able to "freeze" the evolution of the dynamic coronal plasma. We describe MUSE's multi-slit
approach and show that the optimization of the design minimizes the impact of spectral lines from
neighboring slits, generally allowing line parameters to be accurately determined. We also describe
a Spectral Disambiguation Code to resolve multi-slit ambiguity in locations where secondary lines
are bright. We use simulations of the corona and eruptions to perform validation tests and show that
the multi-slit disambiguation approach allows accurate determination of MUSE observables in
locations where significant multi-slit contamination occurs.
