We present an extended grid of state-of-the art stellar models for low-mass stars including updated
physics (nuclear reaction rates, surface boundary condition, mass-loss rate, angular momentum
transport, torque and rotation-induced mixing prescriptions). We aim at evaluating the impact
of wind braking, realistic atmospheric treatment, rotation and rotation-induced mixing on the
structural and rotational evolution from the pre-main sequence to the turn-off. Using the STAREVOL
code, we provide an updated PMS grid. We compute stellar models for 7 different metallicities, from
[Fe/H] = -1 dex to [Fe/H] = +0.3 dex with a solar composition corresponding to $Z=0.0134$. The initial
stellar mass ranges from 0.2 to 1.5\Ms with extra grid refinement around one solar mass. We also provide
rotating models for three different initial rotation rates (slow, median and fast) with prescriptions
for the wind braking and disc-coupling timescale calibrated on observed properties of young open
clusters. The rotational mixing includes an up-to-date description of the turbulence anisotropy
in stably stratified regions. The overall behaviour of our models at solar metallicity -- and its
constitutive physics -- is validated through a detailed comparison with a variety of distributed
evolutionary tracks. The main differences arise from the choice of surface boundary conditions
and initial solar composition. The models including rotation with our prescription for angular
momentum extraction and self-consistent formalism for angular momentum transport are able to
reproduce the rotation period distribution observed in young open clusters over a broad mass-range.
These models are publicly available and may be used to analyse data coming from present and forthcoming
asteroseismic and spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia, TESS and PLATO.
