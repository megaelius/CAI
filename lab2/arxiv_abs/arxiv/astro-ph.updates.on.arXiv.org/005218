Brightness inhomogeneities in the stellar photosphere (dark spots or bright regions) affect the
measurements of the planetary transmission spectrum. To investigate the star spots of the M dwarf
GJ 1214, we conducted a multicolor photometric monitoring from 2012 to 2016. The measured variability
shows a periodicity of 125 +- 5 days, which we interpret as the signature of the stellar rotation period.
This value overrules previous suggestions of a significantly shorter stellar rotation period.
A light curve inversion of the monitoring data yields an estimation of the flux dimming of a permanent
spot filling factor not contributing to the photometric variability, a temperature contrast of
the spots of about 370 K and persistent active longitudes. The derived surface maps over all five
seasons were used to estimate the influence of the star spots on the transmission spectrum of the
planet from 400 nm to 2000 nm. The monitoring data presented here do not support a recent interpretation
of a measured transmission spectrum of GJ 1214b as to be caused by bright regions in the stellar photosphere.
Instead, we list arguments as to why the effect of dark spots likely dominated over bright regions
in the period of our monitoring. Furthermore, our photometry proves an increase in variability
over at least four years, indicative for a cyclic activity behavior. The age of GJ 1214 is likely between
6 and 10 Gyr. The long-term photometry allows for a correction of unocculted spots. For an active
star such as GJ 1214, there remains a degeneracy between occulted spots and the transit parameters
used to build the transmission spectrum. This degeneracy can only be broken by high-precision transit
photometry resolving the spot crossing signature in the transit light curve.
