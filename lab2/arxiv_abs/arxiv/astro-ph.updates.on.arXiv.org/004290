Magnetar power is believed to be at the origin of numerous super-luminous supernovae (SNe) of Type
Ic, arising from compact, hydrogen-deficient, Wolf-Rayet type stars. Here, we investigate the
properties that magnetar power would have on standard-energy SNe associated with 15-20Msun blue
or red supergiant (BSG/RSG) stars. We use a combination of Eulerian grey radiation-hydrodynamics
and non-LTE steady-state radiative transfer to study their dynamical, photometric, and spectroscopic
properties. Adopting magnetar fields of 1, 3.5, 7 x 10^14G and rotational energies of 0.4, 1, and
3 x 10^51erg, we produce bolometric light curves with a broad maximum covering 50-150d and a magnitude
of 10^43-10^44erg/s. The spectra at maximum light are analogous to those of standard SNe II-P but
bluer. Although the magnetar energy is channelled roughly in equal proportion between SN kinetic
energy and SN luminosity, the latter may be boosted by a factor 10-100 compared to a standard SN II.
This influence breaks the observed relation between brightness and expansion rate of standard
Type II SNe. Magnetar energy injection also delays recombination and may even cause re-ionization,
with a reversal in photospheric temperature and velocity. Depositing the magnetar energy in a narrow
mass shell at the ejecta base leads to the formation of a dense shell at a few 1000km/s, which causes
a light-curve bump at the end of the photospheric phase. Depositing this energy over a broad range
of mass in the inner ejecta, to mimic the effect of multi-dimensional fluid instabilities, prevents
the formation of a dense shell and produces an earlier-rising and smoother light curve. The magnetar
influence on the SN radiation is generally not visible prior to 20-30d, during which one may discern
a BSG from a RSG progenitor. We propose a magnetar model for the super-luminous Type II SN OGLE-SN14-073.
