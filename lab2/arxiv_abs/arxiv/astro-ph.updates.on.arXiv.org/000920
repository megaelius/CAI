We analyze the multifrequency behavior of the quasar 3C 454.3 during three prominent \gamma-ray
outbursts: 2009 Autumn, 2010 Spring, and 2010 Autumn. The data reveal a repeating pattern, including
a triple flare structure, in the properties of each \gamma-ray outburst, which implies similar
mechanism(s) and location for all three events. The multi-frequency behavior indicates that the
lower frequency events are co-spatial with the \gamma-ray outbursts, although the \gamma-ray
emission varies on the shortest timescales. We determine that the variability from UV to IR wavelengths
during an outburst results from a single synchrotron component whose properties do not change significantly
over the different outbursts. Despite a general increase in the degree of optical linear polarization
during an outburst, the polarization drops significantly at the peak of the \gamma-ray event, which
suggests that both shocks and turbulent processes are involved. We detect two disturbances (knots)
with superluminal apparent speeds in the parsec-scale jet associated with the outbursts in 2009
Autumn and 2010 Autumn. The kinematic properties of the knots can explain the difference in amplitudes
of the \gamma-ray events, while their millimeter-wave polarization is related to the optical polarization
during the outbursts. We interpret the multi-frequency behavior within models involving either
a system of standing conical shocks or magnetic reconnection events located in the parsec-scale
millimeter-wave core of the jet. We argue that \gamma-ray outbursts with variability timescales
as short as ~ 3 hr can occur on parsec scales if flares take place in localized regions such as turbulent
cells.
