The gravitational potential well of an $M>10^{13}$ $M_\odot$ galaxy will lead to a gravitational
redshift differential of order 1 km/s between the galaxy core and its outskirts. Current surveys
of massive galaxies with spatially resolved spectroscopy have reached a size which makes feasible
attempts to detect gravitational redshifts within galaxies. We use spectra from the Mapping Nearby
Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) experiment to attempt a measurement of the averaged
stellar redshift profile of large elliptical galaxies. We find that systematic effects (possibly
related to charge transfer or wavelength calibration accuracy) make the standard MaNGA data pipeline
unsuitable for measuring the relevant sub km/s wavelength shifts. We therefore develop a cross-correlation
technique to mitigate these effects, but caution that we are working beyond the design accuracy
of the MaNGA experiment. With a sample of $272$ galaxies in halos with $\log (M/M_\odot)>13$, we
attempt a measurement of the gravitational redshift profile, achieving $1 \sigma$ errors of size
$\sim 0.5$ km/s, but are unable to make a significant detection of the signal. Even without a detection,
our measurement can be used to limit the dark matter mass within the half light radius of elliptical
galaxies to $1.2$ times the stellar mass, at the 68% confidence level. We also perform weighting
scheme tests and split sample tests, and address target selection issues and other relativistic
effects, including the transverse Doppler effect and relativistic beaming of stars. Future detections
could lead to new constraints on the galaxy mass distribution that are different from kinematic
and lensing determinations and open a window on galaxy properties and tests of gravity.
