We report the results of our spectrophotometric monitoring campaign for AT~2017be in NGC~2537.
Its lightcurve reveals a fast rise to an optical maximum, followed by a plateau lasting about 30 days,
and finally a fast decline. Its absolute peak magnitude ($M_{r}$ $\simeq$ $-$12 $\rm{mag}$) is
fainter than that of core-collapse supernovae, and is consistent with those of supernova impostors
and other Intermediate-Luminosity Optical Transients. The quasi-bolometric lightcurve peaks
at $\sim$ 2 $\times$ 10$^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and the late-time photometry allows us to constrain
an ejected $^{56}$Ni mass of $\sim$ 8 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$\msun. The spectra of AT~2017be show minor
evolution over the observational period, a relatively blue continuum showing at early phases,
which becomes redder with time. A prominent H$\alpha$ emission line always dominates over other
Balmer lines. Weak Fe {\sc ii} features, Ca~{\sc ii} H$\&$K and the Ca {\sc ii} NIR triplet are also
visible, while P-Cygni absorption troughs are found in a high resolution spectrum. In addition,
the [Ca~{\sc ii}] $\lambda$7291,7324 doublet is visible in all spectra. This feature is typical
of Intermediate-Luminosity Red Transients (ILRTs), similar to SN~2008S. The relatively shallow
archival Spitzer data are not particularly constraining. On the other hand, a non-detection in
deeper near-infrared HST images disfavours a massive Luminous Blue Variable eruption as the origin
for AT~2017be. As has been suggested for other ILRTs, we propose that AT~2017be is a candidate for
a weak electron-capture supernova explosion of a super-asymptotic giant branch star, still embedded
in a thick dusty envelope.
