Recent spectroscopic surveys of the Galactic bulge have unambiguously shown that the bulge contains
two main components, that are best separated in their iron content, but also differ in spatial distribution,
kinematics, and abundance ratios. The so-called metal poor (MP) component peaks at [Fe/H]~-0.4,
while the metal rich (MR) one peaks at [Fe/H]$~+0.3. The total metallicity distribution function
is therefore bimodal, with a dip at [Fe/H]~0. The relative fraction of the two components changes
significantly across the bulge area. We provide, for the first time, the fractional contribution
of the MP and MR stars to the stellar mass budget of the Galactic bulge, and its variation across the
bulge area. We find that MP stars make up 48% of the total stellar mass of the bulge, within the region
|l|<10, |b|<9.5, with the remaining 52% made up of MR stars. The latter dominate the mass budget at
intermediate latitudes |b|~4, but become marginal in the outer bulge (|b|>8). The MP component
is more axisymmetric than the MR one, and it is at least comparable, and possibly slightly dominant
in the inner few degrees. As a result, the MP component, which does not follow the main bar, is not marginal
in terms of the total mass budget as previously thought, and this new observational evidence must
be included in bulge models. While the total radial velocity dispersion has a trend that follows
the total stellar mass, when we examine the velocity dispersion of each component individually,
we find that MP stars have higher velocity dispersion where they make up a smaller fraction of the
stellar mass, and viceversa. This is due to the kinematical and spatial distribution of the two metallicity
component being significantly different, as already discussed in the literature.
