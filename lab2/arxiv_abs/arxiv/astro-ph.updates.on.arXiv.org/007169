M dwarf stars are known for their vigorous flaring. This flaring could impact the climate of orbiting
planets, making it important to characterize M dwarf flares at the short wavelengths that drive
atmospheric chemistry and escape. We conducted a far-ultraviolet flare survey of 6 M dwarfs from
the recent MUSCLES (Measurements of the Ultraviolet Spectral Characteristics of Low-mass Exoplanetary
Systems) observations, as well as 4 highly-active M dwarfs with archival data. When comparing absolute
flare energies, we found the active-M-star flares to be about 10$\times$ more energetic than inactive-M-star
flares. However, when flare energies were normalized by the star's quiescent flux, the active and
inactive samples exhibited identical flare distributions, with a power-law index of -$0.76^{+0.1}_{-0.09}$
(cumulative distribution). The rate and distribution of flares are such that they could dominate
the FUV energy budget of M dwarfs, assuming the same distribution holds to flares as energetic as
those cataloged by Kepler and ground-based surveys. We used the observed events to create an idealized
model flare with realistic spectral and temporal energy budgets to be used in photochemical simulations
of exoplanet atmospheres. Applied to our own simulation of direct photolysis by photons alone (no
particles), we find the most energetic observed flares have little effect on an Earth-like atmosphere,
photolyzing $\sim$0.01% of the total O$_3$ column. The observations were too limited temporally
(73 h cumulative exposure) to catch rare, highly energetic flares. Those that the power-law fit
predicts occur monthly would photolyze $\sim$1% of the O$_3$ column and those it predicts occur
yearly would photolyze the full O$_3$ column. Whether such energetic flares occur at the rate predicted
is an open question.
