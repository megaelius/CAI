This work wants to show how standard General Relativity is able to explain galactic rotation curves
without the need for dark matter, this starting from the idea that when Einstein's equations are
applied to the dynamics of a galaxy embedded in an expanding universe they do not reduce to Poisson's
equation but a generalisation of it taking cosmological expansion into account. A non-linear scheme
to perturb Einstein's field equations around the Robertson-Walker metric is devised in order to
find their non-relativistic limit without losing their characteristic non-linearities. The
resulting equation is used to numerically study the gravitational potential of a cosmological
perturbation and applied to a simple galactic model with an exponentially decreasing baryonic
matter distribution in order to obtain rotation curves to be compared with observational data.
The non-relativistic limit of General Relativity produces a generalised Poisson equation for
the gravitational potential which is non-linear, parabolic and heat-like. It is shown how its non-linearities
generate an effective "dark matter" distribution caused by both cosmological expansion and the
dynamics of the perturbation's gravitational potential. It is also shown how this dynamical effect
gets completely lost during a linearisation of Einstein's equations. The equation is then used
to successfully fit real galactic rotation curves numerically using a matter distribution following
the shape of a simple S\'ersic luminosity profile, common to most galaxies, thus without recourse
to dark matter. A few rotation curves with a faster than Newtonian decrease are also presented and
successfully fitted, opening the way to a new possible interpretation of these phenomena in terms
of an effective "anti-gravitational" dark matter distribution, purely geometrical in origin,
not so easily explained using the dark matter conjecture.
