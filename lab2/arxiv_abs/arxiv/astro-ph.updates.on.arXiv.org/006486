Faraday rotation is one of the most widely used observables to infer the strength and configuration
of the magnetic field in the ionised gas of the Milky Way and nearby spiral galaxies. Here we compute
synthetic Faraday rotation maps at $z=0$ for a set of disk galaxies from the Auriga high-resolution
cosmological simulations, for different observer positions within and outside the galaxy. We
analyse the formation of the synthetic Faraday rotation signal and compare to observations of the
Milky Way and M51. We find that the strength of the Faraday rotation signal of our simulated galaxies
for a hypothetic observer at the solar circle is broadly consistent with the Faraday rotation signal
seen for the Milky Way. The same holds for an observer outside the galaxy and the observed signal of
the nearby spiral galaxy M51. However, we also find that the structure and angular power spectra
of the synthetic all-sky Faraday rotation maps vary strongly with azimuthal position along the
solar circle. We argue that this variation is a result of the structure of the magnetic field of the
galaxy that is dominated by an azimuthal magnetic field ordered on large scales, but has radial and
vertical magnetic field components that are only ordered on scales of a few kpc. Because the magnetic
field strength decreases exponentially with height above the disk, the Faraday rotation signal
for an observer at the solar circle is dominated by the local environment. This represents a severe
obstacle for attempts to reconstruct the global magnetic field of the Milky Way from Faraday rotation
maps alone without including additional observables.
