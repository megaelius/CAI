The mass assembly of galaxies can proceed through different physical processes. Here we report
on the spectroscopic identification of close physical pairs of galaxies at redshifts 2 <z <
4 and discuss the impact of major mergers in shaping galaxies at these early cosmological times.
We aim to identify and characterize close physical pairs of galaxies destined to merge and use their
properties to infer the contribution of merging processes to the early mass assembly of galaxies.
We search for galaxy pairs with a transverse separation r_p < 25 h^{-1} kpc and a velocity difference
Delta v < 500 km s^{-1} using the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS) and early data from the VIMOS Ultra
Deep Survey (VUDS) that comprise a sample of 1111 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts measurements
at redshifts 1.8 < z < 4 in the COSMOS, ECDFS, and VVDS-02h fields. We analyse their spectra
and associated visible and near-infrared photometry to assess the main properties of merging galaxies
that have an average stellar mass M_{star}=2.3 x 10^{10} M_{sun} at these redshifts. Using the 12
physical pairs found in our sample we obtain a first estimate of the merger fraction at these rdshifts,
fmerg ~(15-20)%. The pair separations indicate that these pairs will merge within 1 Gyr, on average,
with each producing a more massive galaxy by the time the cosmic star formation peaks at z~1-2. From
the average mass ratio between galaxies in the pairs, the stellar mass of the resulting galaxy after
merging will be ~60% larger than the most massive galaxy in the pair before merging. We conclude that
major merging of galaxy pairs is on-going at 2<z<4 and significantly contributing to the
major assembly phase of galaxies at this early epoch.
