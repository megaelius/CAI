We investigate the origin of the spectral energy distribution of SDSS J1148+5251, using it as a prototype
for the more general class of high-luminosity high-redshift quasars. To this aim, we run the radiative
transfer code TRADING using a simple model for the central source,including all the radiation that
can travel beyond the dusty torus, and following the transfer of radiation from the central source
and from stellar sources through the dusty environment of the host galaxy. Comparing the model predictions
with the observational data, including the recently published Herschel detections, we find that
the spectral energy distribution of SDSSJ1148+5251 points to an evolutionary scenario where ~
60% of the observed FIR luminosity is due to dust heating by the central AGN; heating due to stellar
radiation provides a necessary but not dominant component to the emission at 20 - 60 micron. We also
find that the required stellar luminosity can only be achieved if the host galaxy is able to sustain
a star formation rate of ~ 1000 Msun/yr at 6.4 < z < 8 through efficient merger-driven bursts;
even if all the stars were formed in this last burst of ~200 Myr of star formation, this inevitably
leads to a final stellar mass that exceeds the limits imposed by dynamical mass measurements for
SDSSJ1148+5251, Mdyn ~ 5.5 x 10^{10} Msun; moreover, a larger stellar mass in the range [2.3 - 4.6]
x 10^{11} Msun is also required to reproduce the observed dust mass if the stars form with a standard
Salpeter-like initial mass function. We discuss the implications of these results for the more
general population of high-z quasars, which also show large dust masses and relatively under-massive
stellar bulges.
