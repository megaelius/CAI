In the implosion conjecture, coronal loops contract as the result of magnetic energy release in
solar eruptions and flares. However, after almost two decades, observations of this phenomenon
are still rare, and most of previous reports are plagued by projection effects so that loop contraction
could be either true implosion or just a change in loop inclination. In this paper, to demonstrate
the reality of loop contractions in the global coronal dynamics, we present four events with the
continuously contracting loops in an almost edge-on geometry from the perspective of SDO/AIA,
which are free from the ambiguity caused by the projection effects, also supplemented by contemporary
observations from STEREO for examination. In the wider context of observations, simulations and
theories, we argue that the implosion conjecture is valid in interpreting these events. Furthermore,
distinct properties of the events allow us to identify two physical categories of implosion. One
type demonstrates a rapid contraction at the beginning of the flare impulsive phase, as magnetic
free energy is removed rapidly by a filament eruption. The other type, which has no visible eruption,
shows a continuous loop shrinkage during the entire flare impulsive phase which we suggest manifests
the ongoing conversion of magnetic free energy in a coronal volume. Corresponding scenarios are
described, which can provide reasonable explanations for the observations. We also point out that
implosions may be suppressed in cases when a heavily-mass-loaded filament is involved, possibly
serving as an alternative account for their observational rarity.
