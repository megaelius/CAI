We performed a detailed study of the evolution of the star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass of
the brightest group galaxies (BGGs) and their relative contribution to the total baryon budget
within $R_{200}$ ($f^{BGG}_{b,200}$). The sample comprises 407 BGGs selected from X-ray galaxy
groups ($M_{200}=10^{12.8}-10^{14} \;M_{\odot}$) out to $z\sim1.3$ identified in the COSMOS,
XMM-LSS, and AEGIS fields. We find that BGGs constitute two distinct populations of quiescent and
star-forming galaxies and their mean SFR is $\sim2$ dex higher than the median SFR at $ z<1.3 $. Both
the mean and the median SFRs decline with time by $>2$ dex. The mean (median) of stellar mass of BGGs
has grown by $0.3$ dex since $z=1.3$ to the present day. We show that up to $\sim45\% $ of the stellar
mass growth in a star-forming BGG can be due to its star-formation activity. With respect to $f^{BGG}_{b,200}$,
we find it to increase with decreasing redshift by $\sim0.35$ dex while decreasing with halo mass
in a redshift dependent manner. We show that the slope of the relation between $f^{BGG}_{b,200}$
and halo mass increases negatively with decreasing redshift. This trend is driven by an insufficient
star-formation in BGGs, compared to the halo growth rate. We separately show the BGGs with the 20\%
highest $f^{BGG}_{b,200}$ are generally non-star-forming galaxies and grow in mass by processes
not related to star formation (e.g., dry mergers and tidal striping). We present the $ M_\star-M_h
$ and $ M_\star/M_h-M_h $ relations and compare them with semi-analytic model predictions and a
number of results from the literature. We quantify the intrinsic scatter in stellar mass of BGGs
at fixed halo mass ($\sigma_{log M_{\star}}$) and find that $\sigma_{log M_{\star}}$ increases
from 0.3 dex at $ z\sim0.2 $ to 0.5 dex at $ z\sim1.0 $ due to the bimodal distribution of stellar mass.
