Using the spectroscopic imaging capabilities of the Swedish Solar Telescope, we aim to provide
the first investigation on the nature and dynamics of elongated absorption features (fibrils)
observed in H$\alpha$ in the internetwork. We observe and identify a number of internetwork fibrils,
which form away from the kilogauss, network magnetic flux, and we provide a synoptic view on their
behaviour. The internetwork fibrils are found to support wave-like behaviour, which we interpret
as Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) kink waves. The properties of these waves, that is, amplitude, period,
and propagation speed, are measured from time-distance diagrams and we attempt to exploit them
via magneto-seismology in order to probe the variation of plasma properties along the wave-guides.
We found that the Internetwork (IN) fibrils appear, disappear, and re-appear on timescales of tens
of minutes, suggesting that they are subject to repeated heating. No clear photospheric footpoints
for the fibrils are found in photospheric magnetograms or H$\alpha$ wing images. However, we suggest
that they are magnetised features as the majority of them show evidence of supporting propagating
MHD kink waves, with a modal period of $120$~s. Additionally, one IN fibril is seen to support a flow
directed along its elongated axis, suggesting a guiding field. The wave motions are found to propagate
at speeds significantly greater than estimates for typical chromospheric sound speeds. Through
their interpretation as kink waves, the measured speeds provide an estimate for local average Alfv\'en
speeds. Furthermore, the amplitudes of the waves are also found to vary as a function of distance
along the fibrils, which can be interpreted as evidence of stratification of the plasma in the neighbourhood
of the IN fibril.
