This thesis investigates the dynamical effect of two structural components of disk galaxies, namely,
the dark matter halo and the interstellar gas on the origin and persistence issue of spiral structure
in disk galaxies through theoretical modeling and numerical calculations. These studies have
been carried out under two well-known paradigm for generation of spiral arms, namely, the density
wave theory and the small-scale material arm generated by swing amplification. The basic theoretical
model of the galactic disk used involves gravitationally-coupled two-component system (stars
and gas) embedded in a rigid and non-responsive dark matter halo. The first part of the thesis involves
searching for the dynamical effect of dark matter halo on small-scale spiral structure in dwarf
low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies and also some dwarf irregular galaxies which host an extended
HI disk. In both cases, the rotation curves are found to be dominated by the contribution of the dark
matter halo over a large radial distance, starting from the inner regions of the galaxies. The next
part of the thesis deals with the investigation of the possible effect of the interstellar gas on
the persistence issue and the pattern speeds of the spiral structure in the disk galaxies. The last
part of the thesis involves in studying the dynamical effect of dark matter halo on large-scale spiral
structure. As shown in this thesis, the dark matter halo and the interstellar have opposite dynamical
effects on the origin and persistence issue of the spiral arms. The dark matter halo suppresses both
small-scale and large-scale spiral instability in those disk galaxies which are dynamically dominated
by dark matter halo from the very innermost regions. On the other hand, the interstellar gas helps
the spiral arms to survive for a longer time-scale (several billion year).
