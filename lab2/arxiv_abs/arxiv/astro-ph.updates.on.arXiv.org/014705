I present a new approach at deriving far-infrared photometric redshifts for galaxies based on their
reprocessed emission from dust at rest-frame far-infrared through millimeter wavelengths. Far-infrared
photometric redshifts ("FIR-$z$") have been used over the past decade to derive redshift constraints
for highly obscured galaxies that lack photometry at other wavelengths like the optical/near-infrared.
Most literature FIR-z fits are performed through $\chi^2$minimization to a single galaxy's far-infrared
template spectral energy distribution (SED). The use of a single galaxy template, or modest set
of templates, can lead to an artificially low uncertainty estimate on FIR-$z$'s because real galaxies
display a wide range in intrinsic dust SEDs. I use the observed distribution of galaxy SEDs (for well-constrained
samples across $0<z<5$) to motivate a new far-infrared through millimeter photometric redshift
technique called MMpz. The MMpz algorithm asserts that galaxies are most likely drawn from the empirically
observed relationship between rest-frame peak wavelength, $\lambda_{\rm peak}$, and total IR
luminosity, L$_{\rm IR}$; the derived photometric redshift accounts for the measurement uncertainties
and intrinsic variation in SEDs at the inferred L$_{\rm IR}$, as well as heating from the CMB at $z>5$.
The MMpz algorithm has a precision of $\sigma_{\Delta z/(1+z)}\approx0.3-0.4$, similar to single-template
fits, while providing a more accurate estimate of the FIR-$z$ uncertainty with reduced chi-squared
of order $\mathcal{O}(\chi^2_{\nu})=1$, compared to alternative far-infrared photometric
redshift techniques (with $\mathcal{O}(\chi^2_{\nu})\approx10-10^{3}$).
