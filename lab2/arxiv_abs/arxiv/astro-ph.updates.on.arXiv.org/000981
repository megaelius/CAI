We study the implications of averaging methods with different reference depth scales for 3D hydrodynamical
model atmospheres computed with the Stagger-code. The temporally and spatially averaged (hereafter
denoted as <3D>) models are explored in the light of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE)
spectral line formation by comparing spectrum calculations using full 3D atmosphere structures
with those from <3D> averages. We explore methods for computing mean <3D> stratifications
from the Stagger-grid time-dependent 3D radiative hydro- dynamical atmosphere models by considering
four different reference depth scales (geometrical depth, column-mass density, and two optical
depth scales). Furthermore, we investigate the influence of alternative averages (logarithmic
or enforced hydrostatic equilibrium, flux-weighted temperatures). For the line formation we
compute curves of growth for Fe i and Fe ii lines in LTE . The resulting <3D> stratifications
for the four reference depth scales can be considerably different. We find typically that in the
upper atmosphere and in the superadiabatic region just below the optical surface, where the temperature
and density fluctuations are highest, the differences become considerable and increase for higher
Teff, lower logg, and lower [Fe/H]. The differential comparison of spectral line formation shows
distinctive differences depending on which <3D> model is applied. The averages over layers
of constant column-mass density yield the best mean <3D> representation for LTE line formation,
while the averages on layers at constant geometrical height are the least appropriate. Unexpectedly,
the usually preferred averages over layers of constant optical depth are prone to the increasing
interference of the reversed granulation towards higher effective temperature, in particular
at low metallicity.
