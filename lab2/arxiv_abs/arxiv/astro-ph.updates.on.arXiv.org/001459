We perform a systematic study of the dynamics of dust particles in protoplanetary disks with embedded
planets using global 2-D and 3-D inviscid hydrodynamic simulations. Lagrangian particles have
been implemented into magnetohydrodynamic code Athena with cylindrical coordinates. We find
two distinct outcomes depending on the mass of the embedded planet. In the presence of a low mass planet
($8 M_{\oplus}$), two narrow gaps start to open in the gas on each side of the planet where the density
waves shock. These shallow gaps can dramatically affect particle drift speed and cause significant,
roughly axisymmetric dust depletion. On the other hand, a more massive planet ($>0.1 M_{J}$)
carves out a deeper gap with sharp edges, which are unstable to the vortex formation. Particles with
a wide range of sizes ($0.02<\Omega t_{s}<20$) are trapped and settle to the midplane in the
vortex, with the strongest concentration for particles with $\Omega t_{s}\sim 1$. The dust concentration
is highly elongated in the $\phi$ direction, and can be as wide as 4 disk scale heights in the radial
direction. Dust surface density inside the vortex can be increased by more than a factor of 10$^2$
in a very non-axisymmetric fashion. For very big particles ($\Omega t_{s}\gg 1$) we find strong
eccentricity excitation, in particular around the planet and in the vicinity of the mean motion
resonances, facilitating gap opening there. Our results imply that in weakly turbulent protoplanetary
disk regions (e.g. the "dead zone") dust particles with a very wide range of sizes can be trapped at
gap edges and inside vortices induced by planets with $M_{p}<M_{J}$, potentially accelerating
planetesimal and planet formation there, and giving rise to distinctive features that can be probed
by ALMA and EVLA.
