We study the clustering of galaxies as function of luminosity and redshift in the range $0.35 <
z < 1.25$ using data from the Advanced Large Homogeneous Area Medium Band Redshift Astronomical
(ALHAMBRA) survey. The ALHAMBRA data used in this work cover $2.38 \mathrm{deg}^2$ in 7 independent
fields, after applying a detailed angular selection mask, with accurate photometric redshifts,
$\sigma_z \lesssim 0.014 (1+z)$, down to $I_{\rm AB} < 24$. Given the depth of the survey, we select
samples in $B$-band luminosity down to $L^{\rm th} \simeq 0.16 L^{*}$ at $z = 0.9$. We measure the
real-space clustering using the projected correlation function, accounting for photometric
redshifts uncertainties. We infer the galaxy bias, and study its evolution with luminosity. We
study the effect of sample variance, and confirm earlier results that the COSMOS and ELAIS-N1 fields
are dominated by the presence of large structures. For the intermediate and bright samples, $L^{\rm
med} \gtrsim 0.6L^{*}$, we obtain a strong dependence of bias on luminosity, in agreement with previous
results at similar redshift. We are able to extend this study to fainter luminosities, where we obtain
an almost flat relation, similar to that observed at low redshift. Regarding the evolution of bias
with redshift, our results suggest that the different galaxy populations studied reside in haloes
covering a range in mass between $\log_{10}[M_{\rm h}/(h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_{\odot})] \gtrsim
11.5$ for samples with $L^{\rm med} \simeq 0.3 L^{*}$ and $\log_{10}[M_{\rm h}/(h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_{\odot})]
\gtrsim 13.0$ for samples with $L^{\rm med} \simeq 2 L^{*}$, with typical occupation numbers in
the range of $\sim 1 - 3$ galaxies per halo.
