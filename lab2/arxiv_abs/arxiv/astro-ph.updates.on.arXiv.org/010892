The interaction between jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and intracluster medium (ICM) provides
key constraints on the feeding and feedback of supermassive black holes. Much understanding about
AGN feedback is gained from purely hydrodynamic models; however, whether such an approximation
is adequate for the magnetized, weakly-collisional ICM needs to be critically examined. For example,
AGN-blown bubbles in hydrodynamic simulations are easily disrupted by fluid instabilities, making
it difficult to explain the coherence of observed bubbles such as the northwest ghost bubble in Perseus.
In order to investigate whether magnetic tension and viscosity in realistic conditions could preserve
the bubble integrity, we performed the first Braginskii-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
jet-inflated bubbles in a medium with tangled magnetic field. We find that magnetic tension alone
is insufficient to prevent bubble deformation due to large velocity shear at early stage of the evolution.
Although unsuppressed anisotropic viscosity in tangled magnetic field can have similar effects
as isotropic viscosity, when the pressure anisotropy is bounded by microscopic plasma instabilities,
the level of viscosity is substantially limited, thereby failing to prevent bubble deformation
as in the inviscid case. Our results suggest that Braginskii viscosity is unlikely to be the primary
mechanism for suppressing the fluid instabilities for AGN bubbles, and it remains a challenging
task to reproduce smooth and coherent bubbles as observed. Since the dynamical influence and heating
of the ICM critically depend on the bubble morphology, our study highlights the fundamental role
of "microphysics" on the macroscopic properties of AGN feedback processes.
