Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are found in at least 70% of all galaxies, but their formation path is
still unclear. In the most common scenarios, NSCs form in-situ from the galaxy's central gas reservoir,
through merging of globular clusters (GCs), or through a combination of the two. As the scenarios
pose different expectations for angular momentum and stellar population properties of the NSC
in comparison to the host galaxy and the GC system, it is necessary to characterise the stellar light,
NSC and GCs simultaneously. The large NSC (r$_\rm{eff} = 66$ pc) and rich GC system of the early-type
Fornax cluster galaxy FCC47 (NGC1336) render this galaxy an ideal laboratory to constrain NSC formation.
Using MUSE science verification data assisted by adaptive optics, we obtained maps for the stellar
kinematics and for stellar-population properties of FCC47. We extracted the spectra of the central
NSC and determined line-of-sight velocities of 24 GCs and metallicities of five. FCC47 shows two
decoupled components (KDCs): a rotating disk and the NSC. Our orbit-based dynamical Schwarzschild
model revealed that the NSC is a distinct kinematic feature and it constitutes the peak of metallicity
and old ages in the galaxy. The main body consists of two counter-rotating populations and is dominated
by a more metal-poor population. The GC system is bimodal with a dominant metal-poor population
and the total GC system mass is $\sim 17\%$ of the NSC mass ($\sim$ 7 $\times$ $10^8 M_\odot$). The
rotation, high metallicity and high mass of the NSC cannot be uniquely explained by GC-inspiral
and most likely requires additional, but quickly quenched, in-situ formation. The presence of
two KDCs most probably are evidence of a major merger that has altered the structure of FCC47 significantly,
indicating the important role of galaxy mergers in forming the complex kinematics in the galaxy-NSC
system.
