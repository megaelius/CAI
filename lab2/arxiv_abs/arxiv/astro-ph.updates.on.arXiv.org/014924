Identifying low-redshift galaxies that emit Lyman Continuum radiation (LyC leakers) is one of
the primary, indirect methods of studying galaxy formation in the epoch of reionization. However,
not only has it proved challenging to identify such systems, it also remains uncertain whether the
low-redshift LyC leakers are truly "analogues" of the sources that reionized the Universe. Here,
we use high-resolution cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations to examine whether
simulated galaxies in the epoch of reionization share similar emission line properties to observed
LyC leakers at $z\sim3$ and $z\sim0$. We find that the simulated galaxies with high LyC escape fractions
($f_{\rm esc}$) often exhibit high O32 and populate the same regions of the R23-O32 plane as $z\sim3$
LyC leakers. However, we show that viewing angle, metallicity, and ionisation parameter can all
impact where a galaxy resides on the O32-$f_{\rm esc}$ plane. Based on emission line diagnostics
and how they correlate with $f_{\rm esc}$, lower-metallicity LyC leakers at $z\sim3$ appear to
be good analogues of reionization-era galaxies. In contrast, local [SII]-deficient galaxies
do not overlap with the simulated high-redshift LyC leakers on the SII-BPT diagram; however, this
diagnostic may still be useful for identifying leakers. We use our simulated galaxies to develop
multiple new diagnostics to identify LyC leakers using IR and nebular emission lines. We show that
our model using only [CII]$_{\rm 158\mu m}$ and [OIII]$_{\rm 88\mu m}$ can identify potential leakers
from non-leakers from the local Dwarf Galaxy Survey. Finally, we apply this diagnostic to known
high-redshift galaxies and find that MACS1149_JD1 at $z=9.1$ is the most likely galaxy to be actively
contributing to the reionization of the Universe.
