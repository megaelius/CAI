We examine recent high-precision measurements of small-scale quasar clustering (at $z\sim0.5-2$
on scales of $\sim25~\mathrm{kpc/h}$) from the SDSS in the context of the MassiveBlackII (MBII)
cosmological hydrodynamic simulation and conditional luminosity function (CLF) modeling. At
these high luminosities ($g < 20.85$ quasars), the MBII simulation volume ($100~\mathrm{cMpc}/h$
comoving boxsize) has only 3 quasar pairs at distances of $1-4$ Mpc. The black-hole masses for the
pairs range between $M_{bh}\sim1-3\times 10^{9}~M_{\odot}/h$ and the quasar hosts are haloes
of $M_h\sim1-3\times10^{14}~M_{\odot}/h$. Such pairs show signs of recent major mergers in the
MBII simulation. By modeling the central and satellite AGN CLFs as log-normal and Schechter distributions
respectively (as seen in MBII AGNs), we arrive at CLF models which fit the simulation predictions
and observed measurements of the luminosity function and the small-scale clustering measured
for the SDSS samaple. The small-scale clustering of our mock quasars is well-explained by central-satellite
quasar pairs that reside in $M_h>10^{14}~M_{\odot}/h$ dark matter haloes. For these pairs, the
satellite quasar luminosity is similar to that of the central quasars. Our CLF models imply a relatively
steep increase in the maximum satellite luminosity, $L^*_{\mathrm{sat}}$, in haloes of $M_h>10^{14}~M_{\odot}/h$
with associated larger values of $L^*_{\mathrm{sat}}$ at higher redshift. This leads to an increase
in the satellite fraction that manifests itself in an enhanced clustering signal at $\lesssim$
1 Mpc/h. For the ongoing eBOSS-CORE sample, we predict $\sim 200-500$ quasar pairs at $z\sim1.5$
(with $M_h \gtrsim10^{13}~M_{\odot}/h$ and $M_{bh} \gtrsim10^{8}~M_{\odot}/h$) at $\sim25~\mathrm{kpc}$
scales. Such a sample would be $\gtrsim10$ times larger than current pair samples.
