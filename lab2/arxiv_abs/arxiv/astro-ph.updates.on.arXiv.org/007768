We report results from a deep polarization imaging of the nearby radio galaxy 3C$\,$84 (NGC$\,$1275).
The source was observed with the Global Millimeter VLBI Array (GMVA) at 86$\,$GHz at an ultra-high
angular resolution of $50\mu$as (corresponding to 250$R_{s}$). We also add complementary multi-wavelength
data from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA; 15 & 43$\,$GHz) and from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA; 97.5, 233.0, and 343.5$\,$GHz). At 86$\,$GHz, we measure a fractional linear polarization
of $\sim2$% in the VLBI core region. The polarization morphology suggests that the emission is associated
with an underlying limb-brightened jet. The fractional linear polarization is lower at 43 and 15$\,$GHz
($\sim0.3-0.7$% and $<0.1$%, respectively). This suggests an increasing linear polarization
degree towards shorter wavelengths on VLBI scales. We also obtain a large rotation measure (RM)
of $\sim10^{5-6}~{\rm rad/m^{2}}$ in the core at $\gtrsim$43$\,$GHz. Moreover, the VLBA 43$\,$GHz
observations show a variable RM in the VLBI core region during a small flare in 2015. Faraday depolarization
and Faraday conversion in an inhomogeneous and mildly relativistic plasma could explain the observed
linear polarization characteristics and the previously measured frequency dependence of the
circular polarization. Our Faraday depolarization modeling suggests that the RM most likely originates
from an external screen with a highly uniform RM distribution. To explain the large RM value, the
uniform RM distribution, and the RM variability, we suggest that the Faraday rotation is caused
by a boundary layer in a transversely stratified jet. Based on the RM and the synchrotron spectrum
of the core, we provide an estimate for the magnetic field strength and the electron density of the
jet plasma.
