We present a multiwavelength study of 28 Galactic massive star-forming H II regions. For 17 of these
regions, we present new distance measurements based on Gaia DR2 parallaxes. By fitting a multicomponent
dust, blackbody, and power-law continuum model to the 3.6 $\mu$m through 10 mm spectral energy distributions,
we find that ${\sim}34$% of Lyman continuum photons emitted by massive stars are absorbed by dust
before contributing to the ionization of H II regions, while ${\sim}68$% of the stellar bolometric
luminosity is absorbed and reprocessed by dust in the H II regions and surrounding photodissociation
regions. The most luminous, infrared-bright regions that fully sample the upper stellar initial
mass function (ionizing photon rates $N_C \ge 10^{50}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ and dust-processed $L_{\rm
TIR}\ge 10^{6.8}$ L$_{\odot}$) have on average higher percentages of absorbed Lyman continuum
photons ($\sim$51%) and reprocessed starlight ($\sim$82%) compared to less luminous regions.
Luminous H II regions show lower average PAH fractions than less luminous regions, implying that
the strong radiation fields from early-type massive stars are efficient at destroying PAH molecules.
On average, the monochromatic luminosities at 8, 24, and 70 $\mu$m combined carry 94% of the dust-reprocessed
$L_{\rm TIR}$. $L_{70}$ captures ${\sim}52$% of $L_{\rm TIR}$, and is therefore the preferred
choice to infer the bolometric luminosity of dusty star-forming regions. We calibrate SFRs based
on $L_{24}$ and $L_{70}$ against the Lyman continuum photon rates of the massive stars in each region.
Standard extragalactic calibrations of monochromatic SFRs based on population synthesis models
are generally consistent with our values.
