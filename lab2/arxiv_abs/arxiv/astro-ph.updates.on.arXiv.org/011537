The origin of the magnetic field in some systems like AGNs or GRBs is still an open question in astrophysics.
A possible mechanism to explain the magnetic field generation is the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability,
since it is able to transform the kinetic energy, in a shear flow, into magnetic energy. Through the
present work, we investigate the linear and non linear effects produced by the magnetic susceptibility
in the development of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in a relativistic plasma. The magnetic
field in the system is parallel to the flows and the susceptibility is assumed to be homogeneous,
constant in time, and equal in both fluids. In particular, we analyze the instability in three different
cases, when the fluids are diamagnetic, paramagnetic, and when the susceptibility is zero. We compute
the dispersion relation in the linear regime and found that the interface between diamagnetic fluids
is more stable than the original case without magnetic susceptibility. On the contrary, the paramagnetism
makes the interface more unstable. This behavior is increasingly important the higher the magnetization
parameter. Additionally, the interval of relativistic Mach numbers for which the interface is
unstable grows with the magnetic susceptibility, i.e., it is larger for paramagnetic fluids. We
check these analytical results with numerical simulations, and explore the effect of the magnetic
polarization in the non linear regime. We found that the magnetic field is more amplified in paramagnetic
fluids than in diamagnetic ones. Surprisingly, the effect of the susceptibility in the amplification
is stronger when the magnetization parameter is smaller. These results make the KH instability
a more efficient and effective amplification mechanism of seed magnetic fields when considering
the susceptibility of matter.
