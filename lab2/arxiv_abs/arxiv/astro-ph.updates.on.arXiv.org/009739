We report on a possible cloud-cloud collision in the DR 21 region, which we found through molecular
observations with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. We mapped an area of 8'x12' around the region with
twenty molecular lines including the 12CO(J=1-0) and 13CO(J=1-0) emission lines, and sixteen
of them were significantly detected. Based on the 12CO and 13CO data, we found five distinct velocity
components in the observed region, and we call molecular gas associated with these components -42,
-22, -3, 9, and 17 km/s clouds taking after their typical radial velocities. The -3 km/s cloud is the
main filamentary cloud (31,000 Mo) associated with young massive stars such as DR21 and DR21(OH),
and the 9 km/s cloud is a smaller cloud (3,400 Mo) which may be an extension of the W75 region in the north.
The other clouds are much smaller. We found a clear anticorrelation in the distributions of the -3
and 9 km/s clouds, and detected faint 12CO emission having intermediate velocities bridging the
two clouds at their intersection. These facts strongly indicate that the two clouds are colliding
against each other. In addition, we found that DR21 and DR21(OH) are located in the periphery of the
densest part of the 9 km/s cloud, which is consistent with results of recent numerical simulations
of cloud-cloud collisions. We therefore suggest that the -3 and 9 km/s clouds are colliding, and
that the collision induced the massive star formation in the DR21 cloud. The interaction of the -3
and 9 km/s clouds was previously suggested by Dickel et al. (1978), and our results strongly support
their hypothesis of the interaction.
