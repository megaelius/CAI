The existence of hot Jupiters is still not well understood. Two main channels are thought to be responsible
for their current location: a smooth planet migration through the proto-planetary disk or the circularization
of an initial high eccentric orbit by tidal dissipation leading to a strong decrease of the semimajor
axis. Different formation scenarios result in different observable effects, such as orbital parameters
(obliquity/eccentricity), or frequency of planets at different stellar ages. In the context of
the GAPS Young-Objects project, we are carrying out a radial velocity survey with the aim to search
and characterize young hot-Jupiter planets. Our purpose is to put constraints on evolutionary
models and establish statistical properties, such as the frequency of these planets from a homogeneous
sample. Since young stars are in general magnetically very active, we performed multi-band (visible
and near-infrared) spectroscopy with simultaneous GIANO-B + HARPS-N (GIARPS) observing mode
at TNG. This helps to deal with stellar activity and distinguish the nature of radial velocity variations:
stellar activity will introduce a wavelength-dependent radial velocity amplitude, whereas a
Keplerian signal is achromatic. As a pilot study, we present here the cases of two already claimed
hot Jupiters orbiting young stars: HD285507 b and AD Leo b. Our analysis of simultaneous high-precision
GIARPS spectroscopic data confirms the Keplerian nature of HD285507's radial velocities variation
and refines the orbital parameters of the hot Jupiter, obtaining an eccentricity consistent with
a circular orbit. On the other hand, our analysis does not confirm the signal previously attributed
to a planet orbiting AD Leo. This demonstrates the power of the multi-band spectroscopic technique
when observing active stars.
