By mapping the large-scale thermal and ionization stucture of the intergalactic medium (IGM),
cosmic 21-cm interferometry is set to revolutionize our understanding of the Epoch of Reionization
(EoR) and the Cosmic Dawn (CD). However, interpreting upcoming observations relies on our ability
to accurately model early galaxies and their cosmic radiation fields which drive the signal. The
first galaxies are likely very rare and biased, with their abundances modulated by long wavelength
modes of the density field. Moreover, the radiation fields from these galaxies interact with the
IGM over a large range of scales. Therefore, the limited volume of 21-cm simulations can underestimate
the amount of structure in the signal. In this work we quantify the minimum box size for simulating
the power spectrum (PS) of the cosmic 21-cm signal. We perform multiple realizations of the initial
conditions, for a range of box sizes. We quantify convergence with respect to a mock observation
of box length 1.1 Gpc, with thermal noise computed for a 1000h observation with SKA1-low. We find
that simulations of box lengths 200-300 Mpc typically do not show a bias in the PS during the EoR; however,
they do tend to underestimate the large-scale power during the earlier epoch of CD by ~7-9 % on average.
The absolute error on the PS from small-box realizations goes up to ~7 mK^2, or analogously up to ~4
sigma of the total noise. As expected, this bias and scatter between different realizations decreases
with increasing box size. We conclude that box lengths of 250 Mpc are needed to converge at the level
of <~1 sigma of the total noise.
