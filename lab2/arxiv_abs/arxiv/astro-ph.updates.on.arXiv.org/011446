We study the evolutionary trend of the total density profile of early-type galaxies (ETGs) in IllustrisTNG.
To this end, we trace ETGs from $z=0$ to $z=4$ and measure the power-law slope $\gamma^{\prime}$
of the total density profile for their main progenitors. We find that their $\gamma^{\prime}$ steepen
on average during $z\sim4-2$, then becoming shallower until $z=1$, after which they remain almost
constant, aside from a residual trend of becoming shallower towards $z=0$. We also compare to a statistical
sample of ETGs at different redshifts, selected based on their luminosity profiles and stellar
masses. Due to different selection effects, the average slopes of the statistical samples follow
a modified evolutionary trend. They monotonically decrease since $z=3$, and after $z\approx 1$,
they remain nearly invariant with a mild increase towards $z=0$. These evolutionary trends are
mass-dependent for both samples, with low-mass galaxies having in general steeper slopes than
their more massive counterparts. Galaxies that transitioned to ETGs more recently have steeper
mean slopes as they tend to be smaller and more compact at any given redshift. By analyzing the impact
of mergers and AGN feedback on the progenitors' evolution, we conjecture a multi-phase path leading
to isothermality in ETGs: dissipation associated with rapid wet mergers tends to steepen $\gamma^{\prime}$
from $z=4$ to $z=2$, whereas subsequent AGN feedback (especially in the kinetic mode) makes $\gamma^{\prime}$
shallower again from $z=2$ to $z=1$. Afterwards, passive evolution from $z=1$ to $z=0$, mainly
through gas-poor mergers, mildly decreases $\gamma^{\prime}$ and maintains the overall mass
distribution close to isothermal.
