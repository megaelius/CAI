Blue straggler stars (BSSs) are brighter and bluer than the main-sequence (MS) turnoff and more
massive than MS stars.Two scenarios for their formation have been proposed: collision-induced
stellar mergers (COL-BSSs),or mass-transfer in binary systems (MT-BSSs).Depleted surface abundances
of C and O are expected for MT-BSSs,whereas no chemical anomalies are predicted for COL-BSSs. Both
MT and COL-BSSs should rotate fast,but braking mechanisms may intervene with efficiencies and
time-scales unknown,thus preventing a clear prediction of the expected rotational velocities.
In this context,an extensive survey is ongoing by using FLAMES@VLT, with the aim to obtain abundance
patterns and rotational velocities for representative samples of BSSs in Galactic GCs.A sub-population
of CO-depleted BSSs has been identified in 47 Tuc,with only one fast rotating star detected (Ferraro
et al.2006). For this PhD Thesis work I analyzed FLAMES spectra of more than 130 BSSs in 4 GCs:M4,NGC
6397,M30 and {\omega}Centauri.This is the largest BSS sample spectroscopically investigated
so far.Hints of CO-depletion have been observed in only 4-5 cases (in M30 and {\omega}Centauri),suggesting
either that the majority of BSSs have a collisional origin, or that CO- depletion is a transient phenomenon.Unfortunately,no
conclusions in terms of formation mechanism could be drawn in a large number of cases,because of
the effects of radiative levitation.Remarkably,this is the first time that evidence of radiative
levitation is found in BSSs hotter than 8200 K.Finally,we also discovered the largest fractions
of fast rotating BSSs ever observed in any GCs:40% in M4 and 30% in {\omega}Centauri. While not solving
the problem of BSS formation,these results provide invaluable information about the BSS physical
properties,which is crucial to build realistic models of their evolution.
