The aim of this work is to develop a comprehensive method for classifying sources in large sky surveys
and we apply the techniques to the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS). Using the
optical (u*, g', r', i') and NIR data (z', Ks), we develop a classifier for identifying stars, AGNs
and galaxies improving the purity of the VIPERS sample. Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised
learning algorithms allow the automatic classification of objects into two or more classes based
on a multidimensional parameter space. In this work, we tailored the SVM for classifying stars,
AGNs and galaxies, and applied this classification to the VIPERS data. We train the SVM using spectroscopically
confirmed sources from the VIPERS and VVDS surveys. We tested two SVM classifiers and concluded
that including NIR data can significantly improve the efficiency of the classifier. The self-check
of the best optical + NIR classifier has shown a 97% accuracy in the classification of galaxies, 97
for stars, and 95 for AGNs in the 5-dimensional colour space. In the test on VIPERS sources with 99%
redshift confidence, the classifier gives an accuracy equal to 94% for galaxies, 93% for stars,
and 82% for AGNs. The method was applied to sources with low quality spectra to verify their classification,
and thus increasing the security of measurements for almost 4 900 objects. We conclude that the SVM
algorithm trained on a carefully selected sample of galaxies, AGNs, and stars outperforms simple
colour-colour selection methods, and can be regarded as a very efficient classification method
particularly suitable for modern large surveys.
