We present results of using individual galaxies' redshift probability information derived from
a photometric redshift (photo-z) algorithm, SPIDERz, to identify potential catastrophic outliers
in photometric redshift determinations. By using two test data sets comprised of COSMOS multi-band
photometry spanning a wide redshift range (0<z<4) matched with reliable spectroscopic or other
redshift determinations we explore the efficacy of a novel method to flag potential catastrophic
outliers in an analysis which relies on accurate photometric redshifts. SPIDERz is a custom support
vector machine classification algorithm for photo-z analysis that naturally outputs a distribution
of redshift probability information for each galaxy in addition to a discrete most probable photo-z
value. By applying an analytic technique with flagging criteria to identify the presence of probability
distribution features characteristic of catastrophic outlier photo-z estimates, such as multiple
redshift probability peaks separated by substantial redshift distances, we can flag potential
catastrophic outliers in photo-z determinations. We find that our proposed method can correctly
flag large fractions of the catastrophic outlier (>50%) galaxies, while only flagging a small fraction
(<5%) of the total non-outlier galaxies, depending on parameter choices. The fraction of non-outlier
galaxies flagged varies significantly with redshift and magnitude, however. We examine the performance
of this strategy in photo-z determinations using a range of flagging parameter values. These results
could potentially be useful for utilization of photometric redshifts in future large scale surveys
where catastrophic outliers are particularly detrimental to the science goals.
