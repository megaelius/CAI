We present three-dimensional simulations of the core-collapse of massive rotating and non-rotating
progenitors performed with the general relativistic neutrino hydrodynamics code CoCoNuT-FMT
and analyse their explosion properties and gravitational-wave signals. The progenitor models
include Wolf-Rayet stars with initial helium star masses of $39\,M_{\odot}$ and $20\,M_{\odot}$,
and an $18\,M_{\odot}$ red supergiant. The $39\,M_{\odot}$ model is a rapid rotator, whereas the
two other progenitors are non-rotating. Both Wolf-Rayet models produce healthy neutrino-driven
explosions, whereas the red supergiant model fails to explode. By the end of the simulations, the
explosion energies have already reached $1.1\times 10^{51}\,\mathrm{erg}$ and $0.6\times 10^{51}\,\mathrm{erg}$
for the $39\,M_{\odot}$ and $20\,M_{\odot}$ model, respectively. The explosions produce neutron
stars of relatively high mass, but with modest kicks. Due to the alignment of the bipolar explosion
geometry with the rotation axis, there is a relatively small misalignment of $30^\circ$ between
the spin and the kick in the $39\,M_{\odot}$ model. In terms of gravitational-wave signals, the
massive and rapidly rotating $39\,M_{\odot}$ progenitor stands out by large gravitational-wave
amplitudes that would make it detectable out to almost 2 Mpc by the Einstein Telescope. For this model,
we find that rotation significantly changes the dependence of the characteristic gravitational-wave
frequency of the f-mode on the proto-neutron star parameters compared to the non-rotating case.
The other two progenitors have considerably smaller detection distances, despite significant
low-frequency emission in the most sensitive frequency band of current gravitational-wave detectors
due to the standing accretion shock instability in the $18\,M_{\odot}$ model.
