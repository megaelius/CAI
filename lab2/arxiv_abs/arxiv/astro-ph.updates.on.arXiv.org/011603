Imaging spectrographs are popular instruments used to obtain solar data. They record quasi-monochromatic
images at selected wavelength positions. By scanning the spectral range of the line, it is possible
to obtain bidimensional maps of the FoV with a moderate spectral resolution. In this work, we evaluate
the quality of spectropolarimetric inversions obtained from various wavelength samplings during
umbral flashes. We computed numerical simulations of nonlinear wave propagation in a sunspot and
constructed synthetic Stokes profiles in the Ca II 8542 \AA\ line during an umbral flash using the
NLTE code NICOLE. The spectral resolution of the Stokes profiles was downgraded to various cases
with differences in the wavelength coverage. A large set of wavelength samplings was analyzed and
the performance of the inversions was evaluated by comparing the inferred chromospheric temperature,
velocity, and magnetic field with the actual values at the chromosphere of the numerical simulation.
The errors in the inverted results depend to a large extent on the location of the wavelength points
across the profile of the line. The inferred magnetic field improves with the increase of the spectral
resolution. In the case of velocity and temperature, low spectral resolution data produce a match
of the inverted atmospheres with the actual values comparable to wavelength samplings with finer
resolution, while providing a higher temporal cadence in the data acquisition. We validated the
NLTE inversions of spectropolarimetric data from the Ca II 8542 \AA\ during umbral flashes, during
which the atmosphere undergoes sudden dramatic changes due to the propagation of a shock wave. Our
results favor the use of fine spectral resolution for analyses that focus on the inference of the
magnetic field, whereas the estimation of temperature and velocity fluctuations can be performed
with lower spectral resolution.
