Accurate measurement of temperature in protoplanetary disks is critical to understanding many
key features of disk evolution and planet formation, from disk chemistry and dynamics, to planetesimal
formation. This paper explores the techniques available to determine temperatures from observations
of single, optically thick molecular emission lines. Specific attention is given to issues such
as inclusion of optically thin emission, problems resulting from continuum subtraction, and complications
of real observations. Effort is also made to detail the exact nature and morphology of the region
emitting a given line. To properly study and quantify these effects, this paper considers a range
of disk models, from simple pedagogical models, to very detailed models including full radiative
transfer. Finally, we show how use of the wrong methods can lead to potentially severe misinterpretations
of data, leading to incorrect measurements of disk temperature profiles. We show that the best way
to estimate the temperature of emitting gas is to analyze the line peak emission map without subtracting
continuum emission. Continuum subtraction, which is commonly applied to observations of line
emission, systematically leads to underestimation of the gas temperature. We further show that
once observational effects such as beam dilution and noise are accounted for, the line brightness
temperature derived from the peak emission is reliably within 10-15% of the physical temperature
of the emitting region, assuming optically thick emission. The methodology described in this paper
will be applied in future works to constrain the temperature, and related physical quantities,
in protoplanetary disks observed with ALMA.
