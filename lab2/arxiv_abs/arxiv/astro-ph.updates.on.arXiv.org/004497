We report deep Chandra, HST and VLA observations of the binary neutron star event GW170817 at t<140
d after merger. These observations show that GW170817 is steadily brightening with time and constrain
the emission process as non-thermal synchrotron emission where the cooling frequency nu_c is above
the X-ray band and the synchrotron frequency nu_m is below the radio band. The very simple power-law
spectrum extending for eight orders of magnitude in frequency enables the most precise measurement
of the index p of the distribution of non-thermal relativistic electrons $N(\gamma)\propto \gamma^{-p}$
accelerated by a shock launched by a NS-NS merger to date. We find p=2.17\pm0.01, which indicates
that radiation from ejecta with \Gamma\sim 3-10 dominates the observed emission. While constraining
the nature of the emission process, these observations do not constrain the nature of the relativistic
ejecta. We employ simulations of explosive outflows launched in NS ejecta clouds to show that the
spectral and temporal evolution of the non-thermal emission from GW170817 at t<140 days is consistent
with both emission from radially stratified quasi-spherical ejecta traveling at mildly relativistic
speeds, and emission from off-axis collimated ejecta characterized by a narrow cone of ultra-relativistic
material with slower wings extending to larger angles. In the latter scenario, GW170817 harbored
a normal SGRB directed away from our line of sight. Observations at t< 200 days are unlikely to settle
the debate as in both scenarios the observed emission is effectively dominated by radiation from
mildly relativistic material.
