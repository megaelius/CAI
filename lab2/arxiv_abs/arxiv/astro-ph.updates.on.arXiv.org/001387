The next generation of giant-segmented mirror telescopes ($>$ 20 m) will enable us to observe
galactic nuclei at much higher angular resolution and sensitivity than ever before. These capabilities
will introduce a revolutionary shift in our understanding of the origin and evolution of supermassive
black holes by enabling more precise black hole mass measurements in a mass range that is unreachable
today. We present simulations and predictions of the observations of nuclei that will be made with
the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) and the adaptive optics assisted integral-field spectrograph
IRIS, which is capable of diffraction-limited spectroscopy from $Z$ band (0.9 $\mu$m) to $K$ band
(2.2 $\mu$m). These simulations, for the first time, use realistic values for the sky, telescope,
adaptive optics system, and instrument, to determine the expected signal-to-noise ratio of a range
of possible targets spanning intermediate mass black holes of $\sim10^4$ \msun to the most massive
black holes known today of $>10^{10}$ $M_\odot$. We find that IRIS will be able to observe Milky
Way-mass black holes out the distance of the Virgo cluster, and will allow us to observe many more
brightest cluster galaxies where the most massive black holes are thought to reside. We also evaluate
how well the kinematic moments of the velocity distributions can be constrained at the different
spectral resolutions and plate scales designed for IRIS. We find that a spectral resolution of $\sim8000$
will be necessary to measure the masses of intermediate mass black holes. By simulating the observations
of galaxies found in SDSS DR7, we find that over $10^5$ massive black holes will be observable at distances
between $0.005 < z < 0.18$ with the estimated sensitivity and angular resolution provided
by access to $Z$-band (0.9 $\mu$m) spectroscopy from IRIS and the TMT adaptive optics system. (Abridged)
