Many young, massive stars are found in close binaries. Using population synthesis simulations
we predict the likelihood of a companion star being present when these massive stars end their lives
as core-collapse supernovae (SNe). We focus on stripped-envelope SNe, whose progenitors have
lost their outer hydrogen and possibly helium layers before explosion. We use these results to interpret
new Hubble Space Telescope observations of the site of the broad-lined Type Ic SN 2002ap, 14 years
post-explosion. For a subsolar metallicity consistent with SN 2002ap, we expect a main-sequence
companion present in about two thirds of all stripped-envelope SNe and a compact companion (likely
a stripped helium star or a white dwarf/neutron star/black hole) in about 5% of cases. About a quarter
of progenitors are single at explosion (originating from initially single stars, mergers or disrupted
systems). All the latter scenarios require a massive progenitor, inconsistent with earlier studies
of SN 2002ap. Our new, deeper upper limits exclude the presence of a main-sequence companion star
$>8$-$10$ Msun, ruling out about 40% of all stripped-envelope SN channels. The most likely scenario
for SN 2002ap includes nonconservative binary interaction of a primary star initially $\lesssim
23$ Msun. Although unlikely ($<$1% of the scenarios), we also discuss the possibility of an exotic
reverse merger channel for broad-lined Type Ic events. Finally, we explore how our results depend
on the metallicity and the model assumptions and discuss how additional searches for companions
can constrain the physics that governs the evolution of SN progenitors.
