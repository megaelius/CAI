We use Very Long Baseline Interferometry to measure the proper motions of three black hole X-ray
binaries (BHXBs). Using these results together with data from the literature and Gaia-DR2 to collate
the best available constraints on proper motion, parallax, distance and systemic radial velocity
of 16 BHXBs, we determined their three dimensional Galactocentric orbits. We extended this analysis
to estimate the probability distribution for the potential kick velocity (PKV) a BHXB system could
have received on formation. Constraining the kicks imparted to BHXBs provides insight into the
birth mechanism of black holes (BHs). Kicks also have a significant effect on BH-BH merger rates,
merger sites, and binary evolution, and can be responsible for spin-orbit misalignment in BH binary
systems. $75\%$ of our systems have potential kicks $>70\,\rm{km~s^{-1}}$. This suggests that
strong kicks and hence spin-orbit misalignment might be common among BHXBs, in agreement with the
observed quasi-periodic X-ray variability in their power density spectra. We used a Bayesian hierarchical
methodology to analyse the PKV distribution of the BHXB population, and suggest that a unimodal
Gaussian model with a mean of $107\pm16\,\rm{km~s^{-1}}$ is a statistically favourable fit. Such
relatively high PKVs would also reduce the number of BHs likely to be retained in globular clusters.
We found no significant correlation between the BH mass and PKV, suggesting a lack of correlation
between BH mass and the BH birth mechanism. Our Python code allows the estimation of the PKV for any
system with sufficient observational constraints.
