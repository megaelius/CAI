Based on constraints from Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background, the baryon
content of the high-redshift Universe can be precisely determined. However, at low redshift, about
one-third of the baryons remain unaccounted for, which poses the long-standing missing baryon
problem. The missing baryons are believed to reside in large-scale filaments in the form of warm-hot
intergalactic medium (WHIM). In this work, we employ a novel stacking approach to explore the hot
phases of the WHIM. Specifically, we utilize the 470 ks Chandra LETG data of the luminous quasar,
H1821+643, along with previous measurements of UV absorption line systems and spectroscopic redshift
measurements of galaxies toward the quasar's sightline. We repeatedly blueshift and stack the
X-ray spectrum of the quasar corresponding to the redshifts of the 17 absorption line systems. Thus,
we obtain a stacked spectrum with $8.0$ Ms total exposure, which allows us to probe X-ray absorption
lines with unparalleled sensitivity. Based on the stacked data, we detect an OVII absorption line
that exhibits a Gaussian line profile and is statistically significant at the $3.3 \sigma$ level.
Since the redshifts of the UV absorption line systems were known a priori, this is the first definitive
detection of an X-ray absorption line originating from the WHIM. The equivalent width of the OVII
line is $(4.1\pm1.3) \ \mathrm{m\AA}$, which corresponds to an OVII column density of $(1.4\pm0.4)\times10^{15}
\ \mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. We constrain the absorbing gas to have a density of $n_{\rm H} = (1-2)\times10^{-6}
\ \rm{cm^{-3}}$ for a single WHIM filament. We derive $\Omega_{\rm b} \rm(O\,VII) = (0.0023 \pm
0.0007) \, \left[ f_{O\,VII} \, {Z/Z_{\odot}} \right]^{-1}$ for the cosmological mass density
of OVII, assuming that all 17 systems contribute equally.
