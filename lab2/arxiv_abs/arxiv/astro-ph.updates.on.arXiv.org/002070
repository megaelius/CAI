Millisecond Pulsars are second most abundant source population discovered by the Fermi-LAT. They
might contribute non-negligibly to the diffuse emission measured at high latitudes by Fermi-LAT,
the IDGRB. Gamma-ray sources also contribute to the anisotropy of the IDGRB measured on small scales
by Fermi-LAT. We aim to assess the contribution of the unresolved counterpart of the detected MSPs
population to the IDGRB and the maximal fraction of the measured anisotropy produced by this source
class. We model the MSPs spatial distribution in the Galaxy and the gamma-ray emission parameters
by considering radio and gamma-ray observational constraints. By simulating a large number of
MSPs populations, we compute the average diffuse emission and the anisotropy 1-sigma upper limit.
The emission from unresolved MSPs at 2 GeV, where the peak of the spectrum is located, is at most 0.9%
of the measured IDGRB above 10 degrees in latitude. The 1-sigma upper limit on the angular power for
unresolved MSP sources turns out to be about a factor of 60 smaller than Fermi-LAT measurements above
30 degrees. Our results indicate that this galactic source class represents a negligible contributor
to the high-latitude gamma-ray sky and confirm that most of the intensity and geometrical properties
of the measured diffuse emission are imputable to other extragalactic source classes. Nevertheless,
given the MSP distribution, we expect them to contribute significantly to the gamma-ray diffuse
emission at low latitudes. Since, along the galactic disk, the population of young Pulsars overcomes
in number the one of MSPs, we compute the gamma-ray emission from the whole population of unresolved
Pulsars in two low-latitude regions: the inner Galaxy and the galactic center.
