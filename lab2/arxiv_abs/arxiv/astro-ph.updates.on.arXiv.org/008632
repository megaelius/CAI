Mrk 71/NGC 2366 is the closest Green Pea (GP) analog and candidate Lyman Continuum (LyC) emitter.
Recently, 11 LyC-leaking GPs have been detected through direct observations of the ionizing continuum,
making this the most abundant class of confirmed LyC-emitters at any redshift. High resolution,
multi-wavelength studies of GPs can lead to an understanding of the method(s), through which LyC
escapes from these galaxies. The proximity of Mrk 71/NCG 2366 offers unprecedented detail on the
inner workings of a GP analog, and enables us to identify the mechanisms of LyC escape. We use 5825-7650{\AA}
integral field unit PMAS observations to study the kinematics and physical conditions in Mrk 71.
An electron density map is obtained from the [S II] ratio. A fortuitous second order contamination
by the [O II]3727 doublet enables the construction of an electron temperature map. Resolved maps
of sound speed, thermal broadening, "true" velocity dispersion, and Mach number are obtained and
compared to the high resolution magneto-hydrodynamic SILCC simulations. Two regions of increased
velocity dispersion indicative of outflows are detected to the north and south of the super star
cluster, knot B, with redshifted and blueshifted velocities, respectively. We confirm the presence
of a faint broad kinematical component, which is seemingly decoupled from the outflow regions,
and is fainter and narrower than previously reported in the literature. Within uncertainties,
the low- and high-ionization gas move together. Outside of the core of Mrk 71, an increase in Mach
numbers is detected, implying a decrease in gas density. Simulations suggest this drop in density
can be as high as ~4 dex, down to almost optically thin levels, which would imply a non-zero LyC escape
fraction along the outflows... [abridged]
