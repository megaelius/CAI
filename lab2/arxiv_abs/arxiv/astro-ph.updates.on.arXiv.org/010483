The Simons Observatory (SO) is a ground-based cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment sited
on Cerro Toco in the Atacama Desert in Chile that promises to provide breakthrough discoveries in
fundamental physics, cosmology, and astrophysics. Supported by the Simons Foundation, the Heising-Simons
Foundation, and with contributions from collaborating institutions, SO will see first light in
2021 and start a five year survey in 2022. SO has 287 collaborators from 12 countries and 53 institutions,
including 85 students and 90 postdocs. The SO experiment in its currently funded form ('SO-Nominal')
consists of three 0.4 m Small Aperture Telescopes (SATs) and one 6 m Large Aperture Telescope (LAT).
Optimized for minimizing systematic errors in polarization measurements at large angular scales,
the SATs will perform a deep, degree-scale survey of 10% of the sky to search for the signature of primordial
gravitational waves. The LAT will survey 40% of the sky with arc-minute resolution. These observations
will measure (or limit) the sum of neutrino masses, search for light relics, measure the early behavior
of Dark Energy, and refine our understanding of the intergalactic medium, clusters and the role
of feedback in galaxy formation. With up to ten times the sensitivity and five times the angular resolution
of the Planck satellite, and roughly an order of magnitude increase in mapping speed over currently
operating ("Stage 3") experiments, SO will measure the CMB temperature and polarization fluctuations
to exquisite precision in six frequency bands from 27 to 280 GHz. SO will rapidly advance CMB science
while informing the design of future observatories such as CMB-S4.
