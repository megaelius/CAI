The General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) will carry out a sensitive dark matter search by measuring
low-energy ($\mathrm{E} < 0.25 \mathrm{GeV/nucleon}$) cosmic ray antinuclei. The primary targets
are low-energy antideuterons produced in the annihilation or decay of dark matter. At these energies
antideuterons from secondary/tertiary interactions are expected to have very low fluxes, significantly
below those predicted by well-motivated, beyond the standard model theories. GAPS will also conduct
low-energy antiproton and antihelium searches. Combined, these observations will provide a powerful
search for dark matter and provide the best observations to date on primordial black hole evaporation
on Galactic length scales. The GAPS instrument detects antinuclei using the novel exotic atom technique.
It consists of a central tracker with a surrounding time-of-flight (TOF) system. The tracker is
a one cubic meter volume containing 10 cm-diameter lithium-drifted silicon (Si(Li)) detectors.
The TOF is a plastic scintillator system that will both trigger the Si(Li) tracker and enable better
reconstruction of particle tracks. After coming to rest in the tracker, antinuclei will form an
excited exotic atom. This will then de-excite via characteristic X-ray transitions before producing
a pion/proton star when the antiparticle annihilates with the nucleus. This unique event topology
will give GAPS the nearly background-free detection capability required for a rare-event search.
Here we present the scientific motivation for the GAPS experiment, its design and its current status
as it prepares for flight in the austral summer of 2021-22.
