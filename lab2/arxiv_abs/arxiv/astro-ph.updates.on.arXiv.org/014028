Using the catalogues of galaxy clusters from The Three Hundred project, modelled with both hydrodynamic
simulations, (Gadget-X and Gadget-MUSIC), and semi-analytic models (SAMs), we study the scatter
and self-similarity of the profiles and distributions of the baryonic components of the clusters:
the stellar and gas mass, metallicity, the stellar age, gas temperature, and the (specific) star
formation rate. Through comparisons with observational results, we find that the shape and the
scatter of the gas density profiles matches well the observed trends including the reduced scatter
at large radii which is a signature of self-similarity suggested in previous studies. One of our
simulated sets, Gadget-X, reproduces well the shape of the observed temperature profile, while
Gadget-MUSIC has a higher and flatter profile in the cluster centre and a lower and steeper profile
at large radii. The gas metallicity profiles from both simulation sets, despite following the observed
trend, have a relatively lower normalisation. The cumulative stellar density profiles from SAMs
are in better agreement with the observed result than both hydrodynamic simulations which show
relatively higher profiles. The scatter in these physical profiles, especially in the cluster
centre region, shows a dependence on the cluster dynamical state and on the cool-core/non-cool-core
dichotomy. The stellar age, metallicity and (s)SFR show very large scatter, which are then presented
in 2D maps. We also do not find any clear radial dependence of these properties. However, the brightest
central galaxies have distinguishable features compared to the properties of the satellite galaxies.
