Galaxy cluster centring is a key issue for precision cosmology studies using galaxy surveys. Mis-identification
of central galaxies causes systematics in various studies such as cluster lensing, satellite kinematics,
and galaxy clustering. The red-sequence Matched-filter Probabilistic Percolation (redMaPPer)
estimates the probability that each member galaxy is central from photometric information rather
than specifying one central galaxy. The redMaPPer estimates can be used for calibrating the off-centring
effect, however, the centring algorithm has not previously been well-tested. We test the centring
probabilities of redMaPPer cluster catalog using the projected cross correlation between redMaPPer
clusters with photometric red galaxies and galaxy-galaxy lensing. We focus on the subsample of
redMaPPer clusters in which the redMaPPer central galaxies (RMCGs) are not the brightest member
galaxies (BMEM) and both of them have spectroscopic redshift. This subsample represents nearly
10% of the whole cluster sample. We find a clear difference in the cross-correlation measurements
between RMCGs and BMEMs, and the estimated centring probability is 74$\pm$10% for RMCGs and 13$\pm$4%
for BMEMs in the Gaussian offset model and 78$\pm$9% for RMCGs and 5$\pm$5% for BMEMs in the NFW offset
model. These values are in agreement with the centring probability values reported by redMaPPer
(75% for RMCG and 10% for BMEMs) within 1$\sigma$. Our analysis provides a strong consistency test
of the redMaPPer centring probabilities. Our results suggest that redMaPPer centring probabilities
are reliably estimated. We confirm that the brightest galaxy in the cluster is not always the central
galaxy as has been shown in previous works.
