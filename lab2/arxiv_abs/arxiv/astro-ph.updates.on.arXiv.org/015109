We present ALMA ~0.02"-resolution observations of the nucleus of the nearby (~14 Mpc) type-2 AGN
NGC 1068 at HCN/HCO+/HNC J=3-2 lines, as well as at their 13C isotopologue and vibrationally excited
lines, to scrutinize the morphological/dynamical/chemical/physical properties of dense molecular
gas in the putative dusty molecular torus around a mass-accreting supermassive black hole. We confirm
almost east-west-oriented dense molecular gas emission both morphologically and dynamically,
which we regard as coming from the torus. Bright emission is compact (<3 pc), and low-surface-brightness
emission extends out to 5-7 pc. These dense molecular gas properties are not symmetric between the
eastern and western torus. The HCN J=3-2 emission is stronger than the HCO+ J=3-2 emission within
the ~7 pc torus region, with an estimated dense molecular mass of (0.4-1.0)x10^6Msun. We interpret
that HCN abundance is enhanced in the torus. We detect signatures of outflowing dense molecular
gas and a vibrationally excited HCN J=3-2 line. Finally, we find that in the innermost (<1 pc) part
of the torus, the dense molecular line rotation velocity, relative to the systemic velocity, is
the opposite of that in the outer (>2 pc) part, in both the eastern and western torus. We prefer a scenario
of counter-rotating dense molecular gas with innermost almost-Keplerian-rotation and outer
slowly rotating (far below Keplerian) components. Our high-spatial-resolution dense molecular
line data reveal that torus properties of NGC 1068 are much more complicated than the simple axi-symmetrically
rotating torus picture in the classical AGN unification paradigm.
