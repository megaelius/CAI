We have used an unbiased, spectral line-survey that covers the frequency range from 211 to 275 GHz
and was obtained with ALMA (angular resolution of 0.4 arcsec) to study the small-scale structure
of the dense gas in Sagittarius B2 (north). Eight filaments are found converging to the central hub
and extending for about 0.1 pc. The spatial structure, together with the presence of the massive
central region, suggest that these filaments may be associated with accretion processes. In order
to derive the kinematic properties of the gas in a chemically line-rich source like Sgr B2(N), we
have developed a new tool that stacks all the detected transition lines of any molecular species.
This permits to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of our observations and average out line blending
effects, which are a common problem in line-rich regions. We derive velocity gradients along the
filaments of about 20-100 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$, which are 10-100 times larger than those typically
found on larger scales (1 pc) in other star-forming regions. The mass accretion rates of individual
filaments are about 0.05 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, which result in a total accretion rate of 0.16 M$_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$. Some filaments harbor dense cores that are likely forming stars and stellar clusters.
The stellar content of these dense cores is on the order of 50% of the total mass. We conclude that the
cores may merge in the center when already forming stellar clusters but still containing a significant
amount of gas, resulting in a "damp" merger. The high density and mass of the central region, combined
with the presence of converging filaments with high mass, high accretion rates and embedded dense
cores already forming stars, suggest that Sgr B2(N) may have the potential to evolve into a super
stellar cluster.
