Faraday rotation occurs along every line of sight in the Galaxy; Rotation Measure (RM) synthesis
allows a three-dimensional representation of the interstellar magnetic field. This study uses
data from the Global Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey, a combination of single-antenna spectro-polarimetric
studies, including northern sky data from the DRAO 26-m Telescope (1270-1750 MHz) and southern
sky data from the Parkes 64-m Telescope (300-480 MHz). From the synthesized Faraday spectral cubes
we compute the zeroth, first, and second moments to find the total polarized emission, mean and RM-width
of the polarized emission. From DRAO first moments we find a weak vertical field directed from Galactic
North to South, but Parkes data reveal fields directed towards the Sun at high latitudes in both hemispheres:
the two surveys clearly sample different volumes. DRAO second moments show feature widths in Faraday
spectra increasing with decreasing positive latitudes, implying that longer lines of sight encounter
more Faraday rotating medium, but this is not seen at negative latitudes. Parkes data show the opposite:
at positive latitudes the second moment decreases with decreasing latitude, but not at negative
latitudes. Comparing first moments with RMs of pulsars and extragalactic sources and a study of
depolarization together confirm that the DRAO survey samples to larger distances than the Parkes
data. Emission regions in the DRAO survey are typically 700 to 1000 pc away, slightly beyond the scale-height
of the magneto-ionic medium; emission detected in the Parkes survey is entirely within the magneto-ionic
disk, less than 500 pc away.
