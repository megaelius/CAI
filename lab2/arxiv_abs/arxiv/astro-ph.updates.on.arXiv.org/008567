We investigate the physical properties of structures seen in channel map observations of 21-cm
neutral hydrogen (HI) emission. HI intensity maps display prominent linear structures that are
well aligned with the ambient magnetic field in the diffuse ISM. Some literature holds that these
structures are "velocity caustics", fluctuations imprinted by the turbulent velocity field,
and are not three-dimensional density structures in the interstellar medium. We test this hypothesis
by stacking probes of the density field -- broadband far infrared (FIR) emission and the integrated
HI column density (NHI) -- at the locations of linear HI intensity structures. We find that the HI
intensity features are real density structures and not velocity caustics. We generalize the investigation
to all small-scale structure in HI channel maps, and analyze this correlation as a function of velocity
channel width, finding no measurable contribution from velocity caustics to the HI channel map
emission. Further, we find that small-scale HI channel maps structures have elevated FIR/NHI,
implying that this emission originates from a colder, denser phase of the ISM than the surrounding
material. The data are consistent with a multi-phase diffuse ISM in which small-scale structures
in narrow HI channel maps are preferentially cold neutral medium (CNM) that is anisotropically
distributed and aligned with the local magnetic field. The shallow spatial power spectrum of narrow
HI channels is often attributed to velocity caustics. We conjecture instead that the small-scale
structure and narrow linewidths typical of CNM explain the observed relationship between the spatial
power spectrum and channel width.
