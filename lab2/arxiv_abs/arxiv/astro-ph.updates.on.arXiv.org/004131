We use spatially resolved spectroscopy from the CALIFA survey to study the nature of the line emitting
gas in galaxies of different Hubble types, focusing on the separation of star-forming (SF) regions
from those better characterized as diffuse ionized gas (DIG). The diagnosis is carried out in terms
of the equivalent width of ${\rm H}\alpha$ ($W_{{\rm H}\alpha}$). Three nebular regimes are identified:
Regions where $W_{{\rm H}\alpha} < 3$ \AA\ define what we call the hDIG, the component of the DIG where
photoionization is dominated by hot, low mass, evolved stars. Regions where $W_{{\rm H}\alpha}
> 14$ \AA\ trace SF complexes. $W_{{\rm H}\alpha}$ values in the intermediate 3--14 \AA\ range reflect
a mixed regime (mDIG) where more than one process contributes.This three-tier scheme is inspired
both by theoretical and empirical considerations. Its application to CALIFA galaxies of different
types and inclinations leads to the following results: $\textit{(i)}$ The hDIG component is prevalent
throughout ellipticals and S0's as well as in bulges, and explains the strongly bimodal distribution
of $W_{{\rm H}\alpha}$ both among and within galaxies. $\textit{(ii)}$ Early type spirals have
some hDIG in their disks, but this component becomes progressively less relevant for later Hubble
types. $\textit{(iii)}$ hDIG emission is also present above and below galactic disks, as seen in
several edge-on spirals in our sample. $\textit{(iv)}$ The SF/mDIG proportion grows steadily
from early to late types spirals, and from inner to outer radii. $\textit{(v)}$ Besides circumventing
basic inconsistencies in conventional DIG/SF separation criteria based on the ${\rm H}\alpha$
surface brightness, our $W_{{\rm H}\alpha}$-based method produces results in agreement with
a classical excitation diagram analysis.
