The Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) R71 is currently undergoing an eruption, which differs photometrically
and spectroscopically from its last outburst in the 1970s. Valuable information on the physics
of LBV eruptions can be gained by analyzing the spectral evolution during this eruption and by comparing
R71's present appearance to its previous outburst and its quiescent state. Here we present the first
spectra of an ongoing monitoring program with VLT/X-shooter and compare them to archival VLT/UVES
and MPG/ESO-2.2m/FEROS spectra from 2002-2011. The discussed data include pre-eruption spectra
in 2002 and 2005, a spectrum of the transitionary phase between quiescent and eruptive state in 2007,
and spectra of the eruption in 2011-2012. The 2011-2012 spectra are dominated by strong neutral
and singly ionized metal absorption lines likely formed in a large "pseudo-photosphere." We find
an unusually low apparent temperature of R71 of only ~6650 K; the star resembles a late F supergiant.
R71's visual lightcurve had a maximum in 2012 with mV ~ 8.7 mag. Given the uncertainty in the extinction
towards R71, this corresponds to a bolometric luminosity of -9.8 mag to -10.3 mag. R71's 2011-2012
spectra do not show H I and Fe II P Cyg profiles, which were present during its last outburst in the 1970s
and which are normally observed during LBV outbursts. The rise in R71's visual magnitude and the
low apparent temperature of its pseudo-photosphere during the current eruption are unprecedented
for this star. R71 most likely increased its bolometric luminosity by 0.4-1.3 mag compared to its
quiescent state. The very low temperature of its pseudo-photosphere implies a very high-mass loss
rate, a factor of 1000 higher than during the quiescence state. No fast-moving material indicative
of an explosion is observed (abridged).
