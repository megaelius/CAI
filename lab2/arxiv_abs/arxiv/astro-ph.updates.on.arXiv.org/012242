One of the key findings of the Rosetta's mission to the Jupiter family comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko
was its peculiar bilobed shape along with the apparent north/south dichotomy in large scale morphology.
This has re-ignited scientific discussions on the topic of origin, evolution and age of the nucleus.
In this work we set up a general numerical investigation on the role of solar driven activity on the
overall shape change. Our goal is to isolate and study the influence of key parameters for solar driven
mass loss, and hopefully obtain a classification of the final shapes. We consider five general classes
of three-dimensional (3D) objects for various initial conditions of spin-axis and orbital parameters,
propagating them on different orbits accounting for solar driven CO ice sublimation. A detailed
study of the coupling between sublimation curve and orbital parameters (for CO and H$_{2}$O ices)
is also provided. The idealizations used in this study are aimed to remove the ad-hoc assumptions
on activity source distribution, composition, and/or chemical inhomogeneities as applied in
similar studies focusing on explaining a particular feature or observation. Our numerical experiments
show that under no condition a homogeneous nucleus with solar driven outgassing can produce concave
morphology on a convex shape. On the other hand, preexisting concavities can hardly be smoothed/removed
for the assumed activity. In summary, the coupling between solar distance, eccentricity, spin-axis
and its orientation, as well as effects on shadowing and self-heating do combine to induce morphology
changes that might not be deducible without numerical simulations.
