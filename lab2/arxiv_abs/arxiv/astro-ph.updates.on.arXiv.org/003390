We present new ALMA observations tracing the morphology and velocity structure of the molecular
gas in the central galaxy of the cluster Abell 1795. The molecular gas lies in two filaments that extend
5 - 7 kpc to the N and S from the nucleus and project exclusively around the outer edges of two inner radio
bubbles. Radio jets launched by the central AGN have inflated bubbles filled with relativistic
plasma into the hot atmosphere surrounding the central galaxy. The N filament has a smoothly increasing
velocity gradient along its length from the central galaxy's systemic velocity at the nucleus to
-370 km/s, the average velocity of the surrounding galaxies, at the furthest extent. The S filament
has a similarly smooth but shallower velocity gradient and appears to have partially collapsed
in a burst of star formation. The close spatial association with the radio lobes, together with the
ordered velocity gradients and narrow velocity dispersions, show that the molecular filaments
are gas flows entrained by the expanding radio bubbles. Assuming a Galactic $X_{\mathrm{CO}}$
factor, the total molecular gas mass is $3.2\pm0.2\times10^{9}$M$_{\odot}$. More than half lies
above the N radio bubble. Lifting the molecular clouds appears to require an infeasibly efficient
coupling between the molecular gas and the radio bubble. The energy required also exceeds the mechanical
power of the N radio bubble by a factor of two. Stimulated feedback, where the radio bubbles lift low
entropy X-ray gas that becomes thermally unstable and rapidly cools in situ, provides a plausible
model. Multiple generations of radio bubbles are required to lift this substantial gas mass. The
close morphological association then indicates that the cold gas either moulds the newly expanding
bubbles or is itself pushed aside and shaped as they inflate.
