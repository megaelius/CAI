Previous star formation studies have, out of necessity, often defined a population of young stars
confined to the proximity of a molecular cloud. Gaia allows us to examine a wider, three-dimensional
structure of nearby star forming regions, leading to a new understanding of their history. We present
a wide-area survey covering 494 square degrees of the Lupus complex, a prototypical low-mass star
forming region. Our survey includes all known molecular clouds in this region as well as parts of
the Upper Scorpius (US) and Upper Centaurus Lupus (UCL) groups of the Sco-Cen complex. We combine
Gaia DR2 proper motions and parallaxes as well as ALLWISE mid-infrared photometry to select young
stellar objects (YSOs) with disks. The YSO ages are inferred from Gaia color-magnitude diagrams,
and their evolutionary stages from the slope of the spectral energy distributions. We find 98 new
disk-bearing sources. Our new sample includes objects with ages ranging from 1 to 15 Myr and masses
ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 solar masses , and consists of 56 sources with thick disks and 42 sources with
anemic disks. While the youngest members are concentrated in the clouds and at distances of 160 pc,
there is a distributed population of slightly older stars that overlap in proper motion, spatial
distribution, distance, and age with the Lupus and UCL groups. The spatial and kinematic properties
of the new disk-bearing YSOs indicate that Lupus and UCL are not distinct groups. Our new sample comprises
some of the nearest disks to Earth at these ages, and thus provides an important target for follow-up
studies of disks and accretion in very low mass stars, for example with ALMA and ESO-VLT X-Shooter.
