Evidence for shocks in nova outflows include (1) multiple velocity components in the optical spectra;
(2) keV X-ray emission weeks to months after the outburst; (3) early radio flare on timescales of
months, in excess of that predicted from the freely expanding photo-ionized gas; and (4) ~ GeV gamma-rays.
We present a 1D model for the shock interaction between the fast nova outflow and a dense external
shell (DES) and its associated thermal X-ray, optical, and radio emission. The forward shock is
radiative initially when the density of shocked gas is highest, at which times radio emission originates
from the dense cooling layer immediately downstream of the shock. The radio light curve is characterized
by sharper rises to maximum and later peak times at progressively lower frequencies, with a peak
brightness temperature that is approximately independent of frequency. We apply our model to the
recent gamma-ray classical nova V1324 Sco, obtaining an adequate fit to the early radio maximum
for reasonable assumptions about the fast nova outflow and assuming the DES possesses a velocity
~1e3 km/s and mass ~ 2e-4 M_sun; the former is consistent with the velocities of narrow line absorption
systems observed previously in nova spectra, while the total ejecta mass of the DES and fast outflow
is consistent with that inferred independently by modeling the late radio peak. Rapid evolution
of the early radio light curves require the DES possess a steep outer density profile, which may indicate
that the onset of mass loss from the white dwarf was rapid, providing indirect evidence that the DES
was expelled by the thermonuclear runaway event. Reprocessed X-rays from the shock absorbed by
the DES at early times may contribute significantly to the optical/UV emission, which we speculate
is responsible for the previously unexplained `plateaus' and secondary maxima in nova optical
light curves.
