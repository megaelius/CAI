Machine learning techniques have been successfully used to classify variable stars on widely-studied
astronomical surveys. These datasets have been available to astronomers long enough, thus allowing
them to perform deep analysis over several variable sources and generating useful catalogs with
identified variable stars. The products of these studies are labeled data that enable supervised
learning models to be trained successfully. However, when these models are blindly applied to data
from new sky surveys their performance drops significantly. Furthermore, unlabeled data becomes
available at a much higher rate than its labeled counterpart, since labeling is a manual and time-consuming
effort. Domain adaptation techniques aim to learn from a domain where labeled data is available,
the \textit{source domain}, and through some adaptation perform well on a different domain, the
\textit{target domain}. We propose a full probabilistic model that represents the joint distribution
of features from two surveys as well as a probabilistic transformation of the features between one
survey to the other. This allows us to transfer labeled data to a study where it is not available and
to effectively run a variable star classification model in a new survey. Our model represents the
features of each domain as a Gaussian mixture and models the transformation as a translation, rotation
and scaling of each separate component. We perform tests using three different variability catalogs:
EROS, MACHO, and HiTS, presenting differences among them, such as the amount of observations per
star, cadence, observational time and optical bands observed, among others.
