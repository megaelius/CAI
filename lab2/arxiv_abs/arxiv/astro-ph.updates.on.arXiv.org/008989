Observations of bright and variable "reflected" X-ray emission from molecular clouds located
within inner hundred parsec of our Galaxy have demonstrated that the central supermassive black
hole, Sgr A*, experienced short and powerful flares in the past few hundred years. These flares offer
a truly unique opportunity to determine 3D location of the illuminated clouds (with ~10 pc accuracy)
and to reveal their internal structure (down to 0.1 pc scales). Short duration of the flare(s), combined
with X-rays high penetration power and insensitivity of the reflection signal to thermo- and chemo-dynamical
state of the gas, ensures that the provided diagnostics of the density and velocity fields is unbiased
and almost free of the projection and opacity effects. Sharp and sensitive snapshots of molecular
gas accessible with aid of future X-ray observatories featuring large collecting area and high
angular (arcsec-level) and spectral (eV-level) resolution cryogenic bolometers will present
invaluable information on properties of the supersonic turbulence inside the illuminated clouds,
map their shear velocity field and allow cross-matching between X-ray data and velocity-resolved
emission of various molecular species provided by ALMA and other ground-based facilities. This
will highlight large and small-scale dynamics of the dense gas and help uncovering specifics of
the ISM lifecycle and high-mass star formation under very extreme conditions of galactic centers.
While the former is of particular importance for the SMBH feeding and triggering AGN feedback, the
latter might be an excellent test case for star formation taking place in high-redshift galaxies.
