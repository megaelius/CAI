CMB full-sky temperature data show a hemispherical asymmetry in power nearly aligned with the Ecliptic.
In real space, this anomaly can be quantified by the temperature variance in the northern and southern
Ecliptic hemispheres, with the north displaying an anomalously low variance while the south appears
consistent with expectations from the best-fitting theory, LCDM. While this is a well-established
result in temperature, the low signal-to-noise ratio in current polarization data prevents a similar
comparison. Even though temperature and polarization are correlated, polarization realizations
constrained by temperature data show that the lack of variance is not expected to be present in polarization
data. Therefore, a natural way of testing whether the temperature result is a fluke is to measure
the variance of CMB polarization components. In anticipation of future CMB experiments that will
allow for high-precision large-scale polarization measurements, we study how variance of polarization
depends on LCDM parameters' uncertainties by forecasting polarization maps with Planck's MCMC
chains. We find that, unlike temperature variance, polarization variance is noticeably sensitive
to present uncertainties in cosmological parameters. This comes mainly from the current poor constraints
on the reionization optical depth, tau, and the fact that tau drives variance at low multipoles.
In this work we show how the variance of polarization maps generically depends on the cosmological
parameters. We demonstrate how the improvement in the tau measurement seen between Planck's two
latest data releases results in a tighter constraint on polarization variance expectations. Finally,
we consider even smaller uncertainties on tau and how more precise measurements of tau can drive
the expectation for polarization variance in a hemisphere close to that of the cosmic-variance-limited
distribution.
