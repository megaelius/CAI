We measure $\lambda_{R_e}$, a proxy for galaxy specific stellar angular momentum within one effective
radius, and the ellipticity, $\epsilon$, for about 2300 galaxies of all morphological types observed
with integral field spectroscopy as part of the MaNGA survey, the largest such sample to date. We
use the $(\lambda_{R_e}, \epsilon)$ diagram to separate early-type galaxies into fast and slow
rotators. We also visually classify each galaxy according to its optical morphology and two-dimensional
stellar velocity field. Comparing these classifications to quantitative $\lambda_{R_e}$ measurements
reveals tight relationships between angular momentum and galaxy structure. In order to account
for atmospheric seeing, we use realistic models of galaxy kinematics to derive a general approximate
analytic correction for $\lambda_{R_e}$. Thanks to the size of the sample and the large number of
massive galaxies, we unambiguously detect a clear bimodality in the $(\lambda_{R_e}, \epsilon)$
diagram which may result from fundamental differences in galaxy assembly history. There is a sharp
secondary density peak inside the region of the diagram with low $\lambda_{R_e}$ and $\epsilon
< 0.4$, previously suggested as the definition for slow rotators. Most of these galaxies are visually
classified as non-regular rotators and have high velocity dispersion. The intrinsic bimodality
must be stronger, as it tends to be smoothed by noise and inclination. The large sample of slow rotators
allows us for the first time to unveil a secondary peak at +/-90 degrees in their distribution of the
misalignments between the photometric and kinematic position angles. We confirm that genuine
slow rotators start appearing above a stellar mass of 2\times10^{11} M_{\odot}$ where a significant
number of high-mass fast rotators also exist.
