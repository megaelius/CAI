Magnetic activity strongly impacts stellar RVs and the search for small planets. We showed previously
that in the solar case it induces RV variations with an amplitude over the cycle on the order of 8 m/s,
with signals on short and long timescales. The major component is the inhibition of the convective
blueshift due to plages. We explore a new approach to correct for this major component of stellar
radial velocities in the case of solar-type stars. The convective blueshift depends on line depths;
we use this property to develop a method that will characterize the amplitude of this effect and to
correct for this RV component. We build realistic RV time series corresponding to RVs computed using
different sets of lines, including lines in different depth ranges. We characterize the performance
of the method used to reconstruct the signal without the convective component and the detection
limits derived from the residuals. We identified a set of lines which, combined with a global set
of lines, allows us to reconstruct the convective component with a good precision and to correct
for it. For the full temporal sampling, the power in the range 100-500~d significantly decreased,
by a factor of 100 for a RV noise below 30 cm/s. We also studied the impact of noise contributions other
than the photon noise, which lead to uncertainties on the RV computation, as well as the impact of
the temporal sampling. We found that these other sources of noise do not greatly alter the quality
of the correction, although they need a better noise level to reach a similar performance level.
A very good correction of the convective component can be achieved providing very good RV noise levels
combined with a very good instrumental stability and realistic granulation noise. Under the conditions
considered in this paper, detection limits at 480~d lower than 1 MEarth could be achieved for RV noise
below 15 cm/s.
