In clustered environments, stellar encounters can liberate planets from their host stars via close
encounters. Although the detection probability of planets suggests that the planet population
in open clusters resembles that in the field, only dozens of planet-hosting stars have been discovered
in open clusters. We explore the survival rates of planets against stellar encounters in open clusters
similar to the Pleiades, Hyades, and Praesepe and embedded clusters. We perform a series of N-body
simulations of high-density and low-density open clusters, open clusters that grow via mergers
of subclusters, and embedded clusters. We semi-analytically calculate the survival rate of planets
in star clusters up to ~1 Gyr using relative velocities, masses, and impact parameters of intruding
stars. Less than 1.5% of close-in planets within 1 AU and at most 7% of planets with 1--10 AU are ejected
by stellar encounters in clustered environments after the dynamical evolution of star clusters.
If a planet population from 0.01--100 AU in an open cluster initially follows the probability distribution
function of exoplanets discovered in the field by RV surveys with semi-major axis ($a_{\rm p}$)
between 0.03--3 AU ($\propto a_{\rm p}^{-0.6}$), the PDF of surviving planets beyond ~10 AU in open
clusters follows $\propto a_{\rm p}^{-0.76}$, which is consistent with the result of direct-imaging
surveys. The production rate of free-floating planets (FFPs) per star is 0.0096--0.18, where we
assume that all the stars initially have one giant planet with a mass of 1--13 $M_{\rm Jup}$ in a circular
orbit. The expected frequency of FFPs is compatible with the upper limit on that of FFPs indicated
by recent microlensing surveys.
