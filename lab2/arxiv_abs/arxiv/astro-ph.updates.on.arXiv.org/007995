We consider AGN photoionization of gas in companion galaxies (cross-ionization) as a way to sample
the intensity of AGN radiation in both direction and time, independent of the gas properties of the
AGN host galaxies. From an initial set of 212 AGN+companion systems, identified with the help of
Galaxy Zoo participants, we obtained long-slit optical spectra of 32 pairs which were a priori likely
to show cross-ionization based on projected separation or angular extent of the companion. From
emission-line ratios, 10 of these systems are candidates for cross-ionization, roughly the fraction
expected if most AGN have ionization cones with 70-degree opening angles. Among these, Was 49 remains
the strongest nearby candidate. NGC 5278/9 and UGC 6081 are dual-AGN systems with tidal debris,
complicating identification of cross-ionization. The two weak AGN in the NGC 5278/9 system ionize
gas filaments to a projected radius 14 kpc from each galaxy. In UGC 6081, an irregular high-ionization
emission region encompasses both AGN, extending more than 15 kpc from each. The observed AGN companion
galaxies with and without signs of external AGN photoionization have similar distributions in
estimated incident AGN flux, suggesting that geometry of escaping radiation or long-term variability
control this facet of the AGN environment. This parallels conclusions for luminous QSOs based on
the proximity effect among Lyman-alpha absorbers. In some galaxies, mismatch between spectroscopic
classifications in the common BPT diagram and the intensity of weaker He II and [Ne V] emission lines
highlights the limits of common classifications in low-metallicity environments.
