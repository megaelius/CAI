The structure of molecular clouds (MCs) holds important clues on the physical processes that lead
to their formation and subsequent evolution. While it is well established that turbulence imprints
a self-similar structure to the clouds, other processes, such as gravity and stellar feedback,
can break their scale-free nature. The break of self-similarity can manifest itself in the existence
of characteristic scales that stand out from the underlying structure generated by turbulent motions.
We investigate the structure of the Cygnus-X North and the Polaris MCs which represent two extremes
in terms of their star formation activity. We characterize the structure of the clouds using the
delta-variance ($\Delta$-variance) spectrum. In Polaris, the structure of the cloud is self-similar
over more than one order of magnitude in spatial scales. In contrast, the $\Delta$-variance spectrum
of Cygnus-X exhibits an excess and a plateau on physical scales of ~0.5-1.2 pc. In order to explain
the observations for Cygnus-X, we use synthetic maps in which we overlay populations of discrete
structures on top of a fractal Brownian motion (fBm) image. The properties of these structures such
as their major axis sizes, aspect ratios, and column density contrasts are randomly drawn from parameterized
distribution functions. We show that it is possible to reproduce a $\Delta$-variance spectrum
that resembles the one of the Cygnus-X cloud. We also use a "reverse engineering" approach in which
we extract the compact structures in the Cygnus-X cloud and re-inject them on an fBm map. The calculated
$\Delta$-variance using this approach deviates from the observations and is an indication that
the range of characteristic scales observed in Cygnus-X is not only due to the existence of compact
sources, but is a signature of the whole population of structures, including more extended and elongated
structures
