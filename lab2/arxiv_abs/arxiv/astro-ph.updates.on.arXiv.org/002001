We report the discovery of a stellar bridge consisting of the young population of stars (YP), that
forms a continuous connection between the Magellanic Clouds (MCs). This finding is based on number
density maps for the young, intermediate-age, and old populations in the Magellanic Bridge (MBR)
region. The maps are based on data gathered in the fourth phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing
Experiment and fully cover over 270 square degrees of the sky in the MBR. This is the most extensive
optical survey of this region up to date. We find that the YP is present mainly in the western half of
the MBR, which, together with the newly discovered YP in the eastern Bridge, form a continuous stream
of stars connecting both galaxies along Dec ~ -73.5 deg. We also find that the YP distribution is clumped,
with one of the major densities close to the SMC, and the other, fairly isolated and located approximately
mid-way between the MCs, which we call the OGLE island. These overdensities are well matched by HI
surface density contours, although the newly found YP in the eastern Bridge is offset by ~2 deg north
from the highest HI density contour. We observe a continuity of red clump stars between the MCs, which
represent an intermediate-age population. Red clump stars are present mainly in the southern and
central parts of the MBR, below its gaseous part, and their presence is reflected by a strong deviation
from the radial density profiles of the two galaxies. This may indicate either a tidal stream of stars,
or that the stellar halos of the two galaxies overlap. On the other hand, we do not observe such an overlap
within an intermediate-age population represented by the top of the red giant branch and the asymptotic
giant branch stars. We also see only minor mixing of the old populations of the MCs in the southern
part of the Bridge, represented by the lowest part of the red giant branch.
