We present a suite of high-resolution cosmological simulations, using the FIRE-2 feedback physics
together with explicit treatment of magnetic fields, anisotropic conduction and viscosity, and
cosmic rays (CRs) injected by supernovae (including anisotropic diffusion, streaming, adiabatic,
hadronic and Coulomb losses). We survey systems from ultra-faint dwarf ($M_{\ast}\sim 10^{4}\,M_{\odot}$,
$M_{\rm halo}\sim 10^{9}\,M_{\odot}$) through Milky Way masses, systematically vary CR parameters
(e.g. the diffusion coefficient $\kappa$ and streaming velocity), and study an ensemble of galaxy
properties (masses, star formation histories, mass profiles, phase structure, morphologies).
We confirm previous conclusions that magnetic fields, conduction, and viscosity on resolved ($\gtrsim
1\,$pc) scales have small effects on bulk galaxy properties. CRs have relatively weak effects on
all galaxy properties studied in dwarfs ($M_{\ast} \ll 10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$, $M_{\rm halo} \lesssim
10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$), or at high redshifts ($z\gtrsim 1-2$), for any physically-reasonable
parameters. However at higher masses ($M_{\rm halo} \gtrsim 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$) and $z\lesssim
1-2$, CRs can suppress star formation by factors $\sim 2-4$, given relatively high effective diffusion
coefficients $\kappa \gtrsim 3\times10^{29}\,{\rm cm^{2}\,s^{-1}}$. At lower $\kappa$, CRs
take too long to escape dense star-forming gas and lose energy to hadronic collisions, producing
negligible effects on galaxies and violating empirical constraints from $\gamma$-ray emission.
But around $\kappa\sim 3\times10^{29}\,{\rm cm^{2}\,s^{-1}}$, CRs escape the galaxy and build
up a CR-pressure-dominated halo which supports dense, cool ($T\ll 10^{6}$ K) gas that would otherwise
rain onto the galaxy. CR heating (from collisional and streaming losses) is never dominant.
