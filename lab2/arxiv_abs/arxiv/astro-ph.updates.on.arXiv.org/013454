Hard X-ray properties of beamed AGN have been published in the 105-month Swift/BAT catalog, but
there have not been any studies carried out so far on a well-defined, radio-selected sample of low-peaked
blazars in the hard X-ray band. Using the statistically complete MOJAVE-1 sample, we aim to determine
the hard X-ray properties of radio-selected blazars, including the enigmatic gamma-ray-faint
type. Also, we aim to determine the contribution of radio-selected low-peaked blazars to the diffuse
CXB. We determined photon indices, fluxes, and luminosities in the range of 20 keV - 100 keV of blazars
and other extragalactic jets from the MOJAVE-1 sample, derived from the 105-month Swift/BAT survey.
We calculated log N-log S distributions and the luminosity functions. The majority of the MOJAVE-1
blazars are found to be hard X-ray emitters albeit many at low count rates. The log N-log S distribution
for the hard X-ray emission of radio-selected blazars is clearly non-Euclidean, in contrast to
the radio flux density distribution. Approximately 0.2% of the CXB in the 20 keV - 100 keV band can
be resolved into MOJAVE-1 blazars. The peculiar log N-log S distribution disparity might be attributed
to different evolutionary paths in the X-ray and radio bands, as tested by luminosity-function
modeling. X-ray variability can be ruled out as the dominant contributor. Low-peaked blazars constitute
an intrinsically different source population in terms of CXB contribution compared to similar
studies of X-ray-selected blazars. The hard X-ray flux and spectral index can serve as a good proxy
for the gamma-ray detection probability of individual sources. Future observations combining
deep X-ray survey, for example, with eROSITA, and targeted gamma-ray observations with CTA can
benefit strongly from the tight connection between these high-energy bands for the different blazar
sub-classes.
