We studied the dynamics of the solar atmosphere in the region of a large quiet-Sun filament, which
erupted on 21 October 2010. The filament eruption started at its northern end and disappeared from
the H$\alpha$ line-core filtergrams line within a few hours. The very fast motions of the northern
leg were recorded in ultraviolet light by AIA. We aim to study a wide range of available datasets describing
the dynamics of the solar atmosphere for five days around the filament eruption. This interval covers
three days of the filament evolution, one day before the filament growth and one day after the eruption.
We search for possible triggers that lead to the eruption of the filament. The surface velocity field
in the region of the filament were measured by means of time-distance helioseismology and coherent
structure tracking. The apparent velocities in the higher atmosphere were estimated by tracking
the features in the 30.4 nm AIA observations. To capture the evolution of the magnetic field, we extrapolated
the photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms and also computed the decay index of the magnetic
field. We found that photospheric velocity fields showed some peculiarities. Before the filament
activation, we observed a temporal increase of the converging flows towards the filament's spine.
In addition, the mean squared velocity increased temporarily before the activation and peaked
just before it, followed by a steep decrease. We further see an increase in the average shear of the
zonal flow component in the filament's region, followed by a steep decrease. The photospheric l.o.s.
magnetic field shows a persistent increase of induction eastward from the filament spine. The decay
index of the magnetic field at heights around 10 Mm shows a value larger than critical at the connecting
point of the northern filament end.
