We present a method called Significant Cosmic Holes in Universe (SCHU) for identifying cosmic voids
and loops of filaments in cosmological datasets and assigning their statistical significance
using techniques from topological data analysis. In particular, persistent homology is used to
find different dimensional holes. For dark matter halo catalogs and galaxy surveys, the 0-, 1-,
and 2-dimensional holes can be identified with connected components (i.e. clusters), loops of
filaments, and voids. The procedure overlays dark matter halos/galaxies on a three-dimensional
grid, and a distance-to-measure (DTM) function is calculated at each point of the grid. A nested
set of simplicial complexes (a filtration) is generated over the lower-level sets of the DTM across
increasing threshold values. The filtered simplicial complex can then be used to summarize the
birth and death times of the different dimension homology group generators (i.e., the holes). Persistent
homology summary diagrams, called persistence diagrams, are produced from the dimension, birth
times, and death times of each homology group generator. Using the persistence diagrams and bootstrap
sampling, we explain how $p$-values can be assigned to each homology group generator. The homology
group generators on a persistence diagram are not, in general, uniquely located back in the original
dataset volume so we propose a method for finding a representation of the homology group generators.
This method provides a novel, statistically rigorous approach for locating informative generators
in cosmological datasets, which may be useful for providing complementary cosmological constraints
on the effects of, for example, the sum of the neutrino masses. The method is tested on a Voronoi foam
simulation, and then subsequently applied to a subset of the SDSS galaxy survey and a cosmological
simulation. Lastly, we calculate Betti functions...
