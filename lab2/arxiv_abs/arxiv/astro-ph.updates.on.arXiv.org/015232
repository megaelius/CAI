The X-ray polarization properties of the reflection nebulae in the Galactic center inform us about
the direction of the illuminating source (through the polarization angle) and the cloud position
along the line of sight (through the polarization degree). However, the detected polarization
degree is expected to be lowered because the polarized emission of the clouds is mixed with the unpolarized
diffuse emission that permeates the Galactic center region. In a real observation, also the morphological
smearing of the source due to the point spread function and the unpolarized instrumental background
contribute in diluting the polarization degree. So far, these effects have never been included
in the estimation of the dilution. We evaluate the detectability of the X-ray polarization predicted
for the MC2, Bridge-B2, G0.11-0.11, Sgr B2, Sgr C1, Sgr C2, and Sgr C3 molecular clouds with modern
X-ray imaging polarimeters such as the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) and the Enhanced
X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission (eXTP). We perform realistic simulations of X-ray polarimetric
observations considering (with the aid of Chandra maps and spectra) the spatial, spectral, and
polarization properties of all the diffuse emission and background components in each region of
interest. We find that in the 4.0-8.0 keV band, where the emission of the molecular clouds outshines
the other components, the dilution of the polarization degree, including the contribution due
to the morphological smearing of the source, ranges between $\sim$19\% and $\sim$55\%. We conclude
that for some distance values reported in the literature, the diluted polarization degree of G0.11-0.11,
Sgr B2, Bridge-B2, Bridge-E, Sgr C1, and Sgr C3 may be detectable in a 2 Ms long IXPE observations.
The enhanced capabilities of eXTP may allow detecting the 4.0-8.0 keV of all the targets considered
here.
