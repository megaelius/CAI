We study the emergence of entropy in gravitational production of dark matter particles, ultra light
scalars minimally coupled to gravity and heavier fermions, from inflation to radiation domination
(RD). Initial conditions correspond to dark matter fields in their Bunch-Davies vacua during inflation.
The ``out'' states are correlated particle-antiparticle pairs, and the distribution function
is found in both cases. In the adiabatic regime the density matrix features rapid decoherence by
dephasing from interference effects in the basis of ``out'' particle states, effectively reducing
it to a diagonal form with a concomitant von Neumann entropy. We show that it is exactly the entanglement
entropy obtained by tracing over one member of the correlated pairs. Remarkably, for both statistics
the entanglement entropy is similar to the quantum kinetic entropy in terms of the distribution
function with noteworthy differences stemming from pair correlations. The entropy and the kinetic
fluid form of the energy momentum tensor all originate from decoherence of the density matrix. For
ultra light scalar dark matter, the distribution function peaks at low momentum $\propto 1/k^3$
and the specific entropy is $\ll 1$. This is a hallmark of a \emph{condensed phase} but with vanishing
field expectation value. For fermionic dark matter the distribution function is nearly thermal
and the specific entropy is $\mathcal{O}(1)$ typical of a thermal species. We argue that the functional
form of the entanglement entropy is quite general and applies to alternative production mechanisms
such as parametric amplification during reheating.
