Part IA: We present numerical measurements of relativistic scaling relations in $(2+1)$-dimensional
conformal fluid turbulence, which perform favourably over their non-relativistic versions.
As seen with incompressible turbulence in past studies, we find that the energy spectrum exhibits
$k^{-2}$ scaling rather than the Kolmogorov/Kraichnan expectation of $k^{-5/3}$. Part IB: We
compute the fractal dimension $D$ of a turbulent anti-deSitter black brane reconstructed from
boundary fluid data using the fluid-gravity duality. Our value of $D=2.584(1)$ is consistent with
the upper bound $D\leq 3$, resolving a recent claim that $D=3+1/3$. We describe how to covariantly
define the fractal dimension of spatial sections of the horizon, and we speculate on assigning a
`bootstrapped' value to the entire horizon. Part II: We report progress implementing a fluid code
with post-Newtonian (PN) gravity in spherical symmetry. The PN formalism couples a fluid, its self-gravity,
and a black hole via elliptic equations. This eliminates radiative modes, allowing larger time
steps, which is helpful for studying systems with very long time scales, eg. tidal disruption events.
Part III: Asteroseismology of rotating core-collapse supernovae is possible with a multimessenger
strategy. We show an $l=2$, $m=0$, $n\gtrsim 2$, $f\lesssim 280$ Hz mode of the core is responsible
for emission in gravitational waves and neutrinos. The angular harmonics of the neutrino emission
is consistent with the mode energy around the neutrinospheres, where $r\sim 70$ km. Thus, neutrinos
carry information about the mode in the outer region of the core, whereas gravitational waves probe
the deep inner core $r \lesssim 30$ km.
