In this paper, we report the multiwavelength observations of a very long filament in active region
(AR) 11112 on 2010 October 18. The filament was composed of two parts, the eastern part (EP) and western
part (WP). We focus on longitudinal oscillations of the EP, which were enhanced by two homologous
C-class flares in the same AR. The C1.3 flare was confined without a CME. Both EP and WP of the filament
were slightly disturbed and survived the flare. After 5 hrs, eruption of the WP generated a C2.6 flare
and a narrow, jet-like CME. Three oscillating threads (thd$_a$, thd$_b$, thd$_c$) are obviously
identified in the EP and their oscillations are naturally divided into three phases by the two flares.
The initial amplitude ranges from 1.6 to 30 Mm with a mean value of $\sim$14 Mm. The period ranges from
34 to 73 minutes with a mean value of $\sim$53 minutes. The curvature radii of the magnetic dips are
estimated to be 29 to 133 Mm with a mean value of $\sim$74 Mm. The damping times ranges from $\sim$62
to $\sim$96 minutes with a mean value of $\sim$82 minutes. The value of $\tau/P$ is between 1.2 and
1.8. For thd$_a$ in the EP, the amplitudes were enhanced by the two flares from 6.1 Mm to 6.8 Mm after
the C1.3 flare and further to 21.4 Mm after the C2.6 flare. The period variation as a result of perturbation
from the flares was within 20\%. The attenuation became faster after the C2.6 flare. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first report of large-amplitude, longitudinal filament oscillations
enhanced by flares. Numerical simulations reproduce the oscillations of thd$_a$ very well. The
simulated amplitudes and periods are close to the observed values, while the damping time in the
last phase is longer, implying additional mechanisms should be taken into account apart from radiative
loss.
