We study the effect of tidal forcing on gravitational wave signals from tidally relaxed white dwarf
pairs in the LISA, DECIGO and BBO frequency band ($0.1-100\,{\rm mHz}$). We show that for stars not
in hydrostatic equilibrium (in their own rotating frames), tidal forcing will result in energy
and angular momentum exchange between the orbit and the stars, thereby deforming the orbit and producing
gravitational wave power in harmonics not excited in perfectly circular synchronous binaries.
This effect is not present in the usual orbit-averaged treatment of the equilibrium tide, and is
analogous to transit timing variations in multiplanet systems. It should be present for all LISA
white dwarf pairs since gravitational waves carry away angular momentum faster than tidal torques
can act to synchronize the spins, and when mass transfer occurs as it does for at least eight LISA verification
binaries. With the strain amplitudes of the excited harmonics depending directly on the density
profiles of the stars, gravitational wave astronomy offers the possibility of studying the internal
structure of white dwarfs, complimenting information obtained from asteroseismology of pulsating
white dwarfs. Since the vast majority of white-dwarf pairs in this frequency band are expected to
be in the quasi-circular state, we focus here on these binaries, providing general analytic expressions
for the dependence of the induced eccentricity and strain amplitudes on the stellar apsidal motion
constants and their radius and mass ratios. Tidal dissipation and gravitation wave damping will
affect the results presented here and will be considered elsewhere.
