Existing 3D extensions to the standard model show that flux-rope footpoints are surrounded by curved-shaped
QSL-footprints that can be related with hook-shaped flare-ribbons. We build upon this finding
and further address the joint questions of their time-evolution, and of the formation of flare loops
at the ends of flaring PILs of the erupting bipole, which are both relevant for flare understanding
in general and for ICME studies in particular. We calculate QSLs and relevant field lines in an MHD
simulation of a torus-unstable flux-rope. The evolving QSL footprints are used to define the outer
edge of the flux rope at different times, and to identify and characterize new 3D reconnection geometries
and sequences that occur above the ends of the flaring PIL. We also analyse flare-ribbons as observed
in EUV by SDO/AIA and IRIS during two X-class flares. The flux-rope footpoints are drifting during
the eruption, which is unexpected due to line-tying. This drifting is due to a series of coronal reconnections
that erode the flux rope on one side and enlarge it on the other side. Other changes in the flux-rope
footpoint-area are due to multiple reconnections of individual field lines whose topology can
evolve sequentially from arcade to flux rope and finally to flare loop. These are associated with
deformations and displacements of QSL footprints, which resemble those of the studied flare ribbons.
Our model predicts continuous deformations and a drifting of ICME flux-rope footpoints whose areas
are surrounded by equally-evolving hooked-shaped flare-ribbons, as well as the formation of flare
loops at the ends of flaring PILs which originate from the flux-rope itself, both of which being due
to purely three-dimensional reconnection geometries. The observed evolution of flare-ribbons
in two events supports the model, but more observations are required to test all its predictions.
