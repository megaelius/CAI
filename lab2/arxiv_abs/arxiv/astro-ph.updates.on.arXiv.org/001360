The most stringent bounds on the absolute neutrino mass scale come from cosmological data. These
bounds are made possible because massive relic neutrinos affect the expansion history of the universe
and lead to a suppression of matter clustering on scales smaller than the associated free streaming
length. However, the resulting effect on cosmological perturbations is relative to the primordial
power spectrum of density perturbations from inflation, so freedom in the primordial power spectrum
affects neutrino mass constraints. Using measurements of the cosmic microwave background, the
galaxy power spectrum and the Hubble constant, we constrain neutrino mass and number of species
for a model independent primordial power spectrum. Describing the primordial power spectrum by
a 20-node spline, we find that the neutrino mass upper limit is a factor three weaker than when a power
law form is imposed, if only CMB data are used. The primordial power spectrum itself is constrained
to better than 10 % in the wave vector range $k \approx 0.01 - 0.25$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Galaxy clustering
data and a determination of the Hubble constant play a key role in reining in the effects of inflationary
freedom on neutrino constraints. The inclusion of both eliminates the inflationary freedom degradation
of the neutrino mass bound, giving for the sum of neutrino masses $\Sigma m_\nu < 0.18$ eV (at 95
% confidence level, Planck+BOSS+$H_0$), approximately independent of the assumed primordial
power spectrum model. When allowing for a free effective number of species, $N_{eff}$, the joint
constraints on $\Sigma m_\nu$ and $N_{eff}$ are loosened by a factor 1.7 when the power law form of
the primordial power spectrum is abandoned in favor of the spline parametrization.
