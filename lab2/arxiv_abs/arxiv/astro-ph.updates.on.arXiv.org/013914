We present 3D full-sphere simulations of supernovae of non-rotating low-mass (~9 Msun) progenitors,
covering the entire evolution from core collapse through bounce and shock revival, through shock
breakout from the stellar surface, until fallback is completed several days later. We obtain low-energy
explosions [~(0.5-1.0)x 10^{50} erg] of iron-core progenitors at the low-mass end of the core-collapse
supernova (LMCCSN) domain and compare to a super-AGB (sAGB) progenitor with an oxygen-neon-magnesium
core that collapses and explodes as electron-capture supernova (ECSN). The onset of the explosion
in the LMCCSN models is modelled self-consistently using the Vertex-Prometheus code, whereas
the ECSN explosion is modelled using parametric neutrino transport in the Prometheus-HOTB code,
choosing different explosion energies in the range of previous self-consistent models. The sAGB
and LMCCSN progenitors that share structural similarities have almost spherical explosions with
little metal mixing into the hydrogen envelope. A LMCCSN with less 2nd dredge-up results in a highly
asymmetric explosion. It shows efficient mixing and dramatic shock deceleration in the extended
hydrogen envelope. Both properties allow fast nickel plumes to catch up with the shock, leading
to extreme shock deformation and aspherical shock breakout. Fallback masses of <~5x10^{-3} Msun
have no significant effects on the neutron star (NS) masses and kicks. The anisotropic fallback
carries considerable angular momentum, however, and determines the spin of the newly-born NS.
The LMCCSNe model with less 2nd dredge-up results in a hydrodynamic and neutrino-induced NS kick
of >40 km/s and a NS spin period of ~30 ms, both not largely different from those of the Crab pulsar at
birth.
