We present a spectroscopic survey of high-redshift, luminous galaxies over four square degrees
on the sky, aiming to build a large and homogeneous sample of Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z\approx5.7$
and 6.5, and Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at $5.5<z<6.8$. The fields that we choose to observe are
well-studied, such as SXDS and COSMOS. They have deep optical imaging data in a series of broad and
narrow bands, allowing efficient selection of galaxy candidates. Spectroscopic observations
are being carried out using the multi-object spectrograph M2FS on the Magellan Clay telescope.
M2FS is efficient to identify high-redshift galaxies, owing to its 256 optical fibers deployed
over a circular field-of-view 30 arcmin in diameter. We have observed $\sim2.5$ square degrees.
When the program is completed, we expect to identify more than 400 bright LAEs at $z\approx5.7$ and
6.5, and a substantial number of LBGs at $z\ge6$. This unique sample will be used to study a variety
of galaxy properties and to search for large protoclusters. Furthermore, the statistical properties
of these galaxies will be used to probe cosmic reionization. We describe the motivation, program
design, target selection, and M2FS observations. We also outline our science goals, and present
a sample of the brightest LAEs at $z\approx5.7$ and 6.5. This sample contains 32 LAEs with Ly$\alpha$
luminosities higher than 10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. A few of them reach $\ge3\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$,
comparable to the two most luminous LAEs known at $z\ge6$, `CR7' and `COLA1'. These LAEs provide
ideal targets to study extreme galaxies in the distant universe.
