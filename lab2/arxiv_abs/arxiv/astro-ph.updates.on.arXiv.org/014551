The H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission line luminosities measured in a single integrated spectrum
are affected in non-trivial ways by point-to-point variations in dust attenuation in a galaxy.
This work investigates the impact of this variation when estimating global H$\alpha$ luminosities
corrected for the presence of dust by a global Balmer decrement. Analytical arguments show that
the dust-corrected H$\alpha$ luminosity is always underestimated when using the global H$\alpha$/H$\beta$
flux ratio to correct for dust attenuation. We measure this effect on 156 face-on star-forming galaxies
from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey. At 1-2 kpc spatial resolution, the effect
is small but systematic, with the integrated dust-corrected H$\alpha$ luminosity underestimated
by $2$-$4$ per cent (and typically not more than by $10$ per cent), and depends on the specific star
formation rate of the galaxy. Given the spatial resolution of MaNGA, these are lower limits for the
effect. From Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations of NGC 628 with a resolution
of 36 pc we find the discrepancy between the globally and the point-by-point dust-corrected H$\alpha$
luminosity to be $14 \pm 1$ per cent, which may still underestimate the true effect. We use toy models
and simulations to show that the true difference depends strongly on the spatial variance of the
H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ flux ratio, and on the slope of the relation between H$\alpha$ luminosity and
dust attenuation within a galaxy. Larger samples of higher spatial resolution observations are
required to quantify the dependence of this effect as a function of galaxy properties.
