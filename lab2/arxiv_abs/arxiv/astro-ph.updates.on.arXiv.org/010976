Understanding chondrule formation provides invaluable clues about the origin of the solar system.
Recent studies suggest that planetesimal collisions and the resulting impact melts are promising
for forming chondrules. Given that the dynamics of planetesimals is a key in impact-based chondrule
formation scenarios, we here perform direct $N$-body simulations to examine how the presence of
Jupiter affects the properties of chondrule-forming collisions. Our results show that the absence/presence
of Jupiter considerably changes the properties of high velocity collisions whose impact velocities
are higher than 2.5 km s$^{-1}$; high velocity collisions occur due to impacts between protoplanets
and planetesimals for the case without Jupiter; for the case with Jupiter, eccentricities of planetesimals
are pumped up by the secular and resonant perturbations from Jupiter. We also categorize the resulting
planetesimal collisions and find that most of high velocity collisions are classified as grazing
ones for both cases. To examine the effect of Jupiter on chondrule formation directly, we adopt the
impact jetting scenario and compute the resulting abundance of chondrules. Our results show that
for the case without Jupiter, chondrule formation proceeds in the inside-out manner, following
the growth of protoplanets. If Jupiter is present, the location and timing of chondrule formation
are determined by Jupiter's eccentricity, which is treated as a free parameter in our simulations.
Thus, the existence of Jupiter is the key parameter for specifying when and where chondrule formation
occurs for impact-based scenarios.
