Radiative transfer describes the propagation of electromagnetic radiation through an interacting
medium. This process is often simulated by the use of the Monte Carlo method, which involves the probabilistic
determination and tracking of simulated photon packages. In the regime of high optical depths,
this approach encounters difficulties since a proper representation of the various physical processes
can only be achieved by considering high numbers of simulated photon packages. As a consequence,
the demand for computation time rises accordingly and thus practically puts a limit on the optical
depth of models that can be simulated. Here we present a method that aims to solve the problem of high
optical depths in dusty media, which relies solely on the use of unbiased Monte Carlo radiative transfer.
For that end, we identified and precalculated repeatedly occuring and simulated processes, stored
their outcome in a multidimensional cumulative distribution function, and immediately replaced
the basic Monte Carlo transfer during a simulation by that outcome. During the precalculation,
we generated emission spectra as well as deposited energy distributions of photon packages traveling
from the center of a sphere to its rim. We carried out a performance test of the method to confirm its
validity and gain a boost in computation speed by up to three orders of magnitude. We then applied
the method to a simple model of a viscously heated circumstellar disk, and we discuss the necessity
of finding a solution for the optical depth problem with regard to a proper temperature calculation.
We find that the impact of an incorrect treatment of photon packages in highly optically thick regions
extents even to optically thin regions, thus, changing the overall observational appearance of
the disk.
