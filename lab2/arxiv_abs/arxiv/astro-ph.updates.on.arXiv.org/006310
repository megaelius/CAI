We have modeled direct collapse of a primordial gas within dark matter halos in the presence of radiative
transfer, in high-resolution zoom-in simulations in a cosmological framework, down to the formation
of the photosphere and the central object. Radiative transfer has been implemented in the flux-limited
diffusion (FLD) approximation. Adiabatic models were run for comparison. We find that (a) the FLD
flow forms an irregular central structure and does not exhibit fragmentation, contrary to adiabatic
flow which forms a thick disk, driving a pair of spiral shocks, subject to Kelvin-Helmholtz shear
instability forming fragments; (b) the growing central core in the FLD flow quickly reaches ~10
Mo and a highly variable luminosity of 10^{38}-10^{39} erg/s, comparable to the Eddington luminosity.
It experiences massive recurrent outflows driven by radiation force and thermal pressure gradients,
which mix with the accretion flow and transfer the angular momentum outwards; and (c) the interplay
between these processes and a massive accretion, results in photosphere at ~10 AU. We conclude that
in the FLD model (1) the central object exhibits dynamically insignificant rotation and slower
than adiabatic temperature rise with density; (2) does not experience fragmentation leading to
star formation, thus promoting the fast track formation of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) seed;
(3) inclusion of radiation force leads to outflows, resulting in the mass accumulation within the
central 10^{-3} pc, which is ~100 times larger than characteristic scale of star formation. The
inclusion of radiative transfer reveals complex early stages of formation and growth of the central
structure in the direct collapse scenario of SMBH seed formation.
