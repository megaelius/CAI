Recent studies of the abundances of H and He relative to those of heavier ions in solar energetic particle
(SEP) events suggest new features in the underlying physics. Impulsive SEP events, defined by uniquely
large enhancements of Fe/O, emerge from magnetic reconnection in solar jets. In small, "pure,"
shock-free, impulsive SEP events, protons with mass-to-charge ratio A/Q = 1 fit the power-law dependence
of element abundance enhancements versus A/Q extrapolated from the heavier elements 2 < Z < 57. Sometimes
these events have order-of-magnitude suppressions of He, even though H fits with heavier elements,
perhaps because of the slower ionization of He during a rapid rise of plasma from the chromosphere.
In larger impulsive SEP events, He fits, but there are large proton excesses relative to the power-law
fit of Z > 2 ions, probably because associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) drive shock waves fast
enough to reaccelerate the impulsive SEPs but also to sample protons from the ambient solar plasma.
In contrast, gradual SEP events are accelerated by wide, fast CME-driven shock waves, but those
with smaller, weaker shocks, perhaps quasi-perpendicular, favor impulsive suprathermal residue
left by many previous jets, again supplemented with excess protons from ambient coronal plasma.
In the larger, more common gradual SEP events, faster, stronger shock waves sample the ambient coronal
plasma more deeply, overwhelming any impulsive-ion component, so that proton abundances again
fit the same power-law distribution as all other elements. Thus, studies of the power-law behavior
in A/Q of SEP element abundances give compelling new information on the varying physics of SEP acceleration
and properties of the underlying corona.
