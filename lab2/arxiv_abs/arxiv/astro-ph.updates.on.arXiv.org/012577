We perform a detailed study of six transiting planetary systems with relatively bright stars close
enough to affect observations of these systems. Light curves are analysed taking into account the
contaminating light and its uncertainty. We present and apply a method to correct the velocity amplitudes
of the host stars for the presence of contaminating light. We determine the physical properties
of six systems (WASP-20, WASP-70, WASP-8, WASP-76, WASP-2 and WASP-131) accounting for contaminating
light. In the case of WASP-20 the measured physical properties are very different for the three scenarios
considered (ignoring binarity, planet transits brighter star, and planet transits fainter star).
In the other five cases our results are very similar to those obtained neglecting contaminating
light. We use our results to determine the mean correction factors to planet radius, $\langle X_R\rangle$,
mass, $\langle X_M\rangle$, and density, $\langle X_\rho\rangle$, caused by nearby objects.
We find $\langle X_R\rangle=1.009\pm0.045$, which is smaller than literature values because
we were able to reject the possibility that the planet orbits the fainter star in all but one case.
We find $\langle X_M\rangle=1.031\pm0.019$, which is larger than $\langle X_R\rangle$ because
of the strength of the effect of contaminating light on the radial velocity measurements of the host
star. We find $\langle X_\rho\rangle=0.995\pm 0.046$: the small size of this correction is due
to two effects: the corrections on planet radius and mass partially cancel; and some nearby stars
are close enough to contaminate the light curves of the system but not radial velocities of the host
star. We conclude that binarity of planet host stars is important for the small number of transiting
hot Jupiters with a very bright and close nearby star, but it has only a small effect on population-level
studies of these objects.
