We present a theoretical study of the effects and signatures of realistic velocity field and atmospheric
inhomogeneities associated with convective motions at the surface of cool late-type stars on the
emergent profiles of iron spectral lines for a large range in stellar parameters. We compute 3D spectral
line flux profiles under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) by employing
state-of-the-art, time-dependent, 3D, radiative-hydrodynamical atmosphere models from the
Stagger-grid. A set of 35 real unblended, optical FeI and FeII lines of varying excitation potential
are considered. Additionally, fictitious Fe i and Fe ii lines (5000A and 0, 2, 4 eV) are used to construct
general curves of growth and enable comparison of line profiles with the same line strength to illustrate
systematical trends stemming from the intrinsic structural differences among 3D model atmospheres
with different stellar parameters. Theoretical line shifts and bisectors are derived to analyze
the shapes, shifts, and asymmetries imprinted in the full 3D line profiles emerging self-consistently
from the convective simulations with velocity fields and atmospheric inhomogeneities. We find
systematic variations in line strength, shift, width, and bisectors, that can be related to the
respective physical conditions at the height of the line formation in the stellar atmospheric environment,
in particular the amplitude of the vertical velocity field. Line shifts and asymmetries arise due
to the presence of convective velocities and the granulation pattern that are ubiquitously found
in observed stellar spectra of cool stars.
