We analyze a large sample of 885 GCs giants from the APOGEE survey. We used the Cannon results to separate
the red giant branch and the asymptotic giant branch stars, not only allowing for a refinement of
surface gravity from isochrones, but also providing an independent H-band spectroscopic method
to distinguish stellar evolutionary status in clusters. We then use the BACCHUS code to derive metallicity,
microturbulence, acroturbulence and many light-element abundances as well as the neutron-capture
elements Nd and Ce for the first time from the APOGEE GCs data. Our independent analysis helped us
to diagnose issues regarding the standard analysis of the APOGEE DR14 for low-metallicity GC stars.
Furthermore, while we confirm most of the known correlations and anti-correlation trends (Na-O,
Mg-Al,C-N), we discover that some stars within our most metal-poor clusters show an extreme Mg depletion
and some Si enhancement but at the same time show some relative Al depletion, displaying a turnover
in the Mg-Al diagram. These stars suggest that Al has been partially depleted in their progenitors
by very hot proton-capture nucleosynthetic processes. Furthermore, we attempted to quantitatively
correlate the spread of Al abundances with the global properties of GCs. We find an anti-correlation
of the Al spread against clusters metallicity and luminosity, but the data do not allow to find clear
evidence of a dependence of N against metallicity in the more metal-poor clusters. Large and homogeneously
analyzed samples from on-going spectroscopic surveys unveil unseen chemical details for many
clusters, including a turnover in the Mg-Al anti-correlation, thus yielding new constrains for
GCs formation evolution models.
