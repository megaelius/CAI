The transport of angular momentum in stellar interiors is currently not well understood. Asteroseismology
can provide us with estimates of internal rotation of stars and thus advance our understanding of
angular momentum transport. We can measure core-rotation rates in red-giant stars and we can place
upper bounds on surface-rotation rates using measurements of dipole ($l=1$) modes. Here, we aim
to determine the theoretical sensitivity of modes of different degree towards the surface rotation.
Additionally, we aim to identify modes that can potentially add sensitivity at intermediate radii.
We use asteroseismic rotational inversions to probe the internal stellar rotation profiles in
red-giant models from the base of the red-giant branch up to the luminosity bump. We calculate the
internal rotation rates using multiplicative optimally localised averages (MOLA) inversions
for different mode sets and different synthetic rotation profiles. We confirm that dipole mixed
modes are sufficient to set constraints on the average core-rotation rates in red giants. However,
surface-rotation rates estimated with only dipole mixed modes are contaminated by the core rotation.
We show that the sensitivity to the surface rotation decreases from the base of the red-giant branch
until it reaches a minimum at $0.6-0.8L_\text{bump}$ due to a glitch in the buoyancy frequency.
Thereafter a narrow range of increased surface sensitivity just below the bump luminosity exists.
Quadrupole and octopole modes have more sensitivity in the outer parts of the star. If observed,
quadrupole and octopole modes enable us to distinguish between differential and solid body rotation
in the convection zone. To obtain accurate estimates of rotation rates at intermediate radii (i.e.
a fractional radius of $\sim0.4$), acoustic oscillation modes with a spherical degree of $l\approx10$
are needed.
