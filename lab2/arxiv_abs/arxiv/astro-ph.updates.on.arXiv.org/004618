We present the results of a set of high resolution chemo-dynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies
in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Out of an original 3.4 Mpc$^3$/h$^3$ cosmological box, a sample of
27 systems are zoomed-in from z=70 to z=0. Gas and stellar properties are confronted to the observations
in the greatest details: in addition to the galaxy global properties, we investigate the model galaxy
velocity dispersion profiles, half-light radii, star formation histories, metallicity distributions,
and [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios. The formation and sustainability of the metallicity gradients and
kinetically distinct stellar populations are also tackled. We show how the properties of six Local
Group dwarf galaxies, NGC 6622, Andromeda II, Sculptor, Sextans, Ursa Minor and Draco are reproduced,
and how they pertain to three main galaxy build-up modes. Our results indicate that the interaction
with a massive central galaxy could be needed for a handful of Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies
only, the vast majority of the systems and their variety of star formation histories arising naturally
from a $\Lambda$CDM framework. We find that models fitting well the local Group dwarf galaxies are
embedded in dark haloes of mass between $5\times 10^8$ to a few $10^9\,\rm{M_\odot}$, without any
missing satellite problem. We confirm the failure of the abundance matching approach at the mass
scale of dwarf galaxies. Some of the observed faint however gas-rich galaxies with residual star
formation, such as Leo T and Leo P, remain challenging. They point out the need of a better understanding
of the UV-background heating.
