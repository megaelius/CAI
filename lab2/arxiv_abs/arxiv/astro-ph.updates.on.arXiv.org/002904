High-resolution imaging reveals a large morphological variety of protoplanetary disks. To date,
no constraints on their global evolution have been found from this census. An evolutionary classification
of disks was proposed based on their IR spectral energy distribution, with the Group I sources showing
a prominent cold component ascribed to an earlier stage of evolution than Group II. Disk evolution
can be constrained from the comparison of disks with different properties. A first attempt of disk
taxonomy is now possible thanks to the increasing number of high-resolution images of Herbig Ae/Be
stars becoming available. Near-IR images of six Group II disks in scattered light were obtained
with VLT/NACO in Polarimetric Differential Imaging, which is the most efficient technique to image
the light scattered by the disk material close to the stars. We compare the stellar/disk properties
of this sample with those of well-studied Group I sources available from the literature. Three Group
II disks are detected. The brightness distribution in the disk of HD163296 indicates the presence
of a persistent ring-like structure with a possible connection with the CO snowline. A rather compact
(less than 100 AU) disk is detected around HD142666 and AK Sco. A taxonomic analysis of 17 Herbig Ae/Be
sources reveals that the difference between Group I and Group II is due to the presence or absence
of a large disk cavity (larger than 5 AU). There is no evidence supporting the evolution from Group
I to Group II. Group II are not evolved version of the Group I. Within the Group II disks, very different
geometries (both self-shadowed and compact) exist. HD163296 could be the primordial version of
a typical Group I. Other Group II, like AK Sco and HD142666, could be smaller counterpart of Group
I unable to open cavities as large as those of Group I.
