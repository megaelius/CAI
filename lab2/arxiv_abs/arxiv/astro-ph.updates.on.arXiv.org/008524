In modern weak lensing surveys, shape measurement algorithms are calibrated using simulations
in order to correct for any residual systematic bias in the shear. These simulations must fully capture
the complexity of the observations to avoid introducing any additional bias. In this paper we study
the importance of faint galaxies below the observational detection limit of a survey. We simulate
simplified Euclid VIS images with and without including this faint population, and measure the
shift in the multiplicative shear bias between the two sets of simulations. We measure the shear
with three different algorithms: a moment-based approach, model fitting, and machine learning.
We find that for all methods, a spatially uniform random distribution of faint galaxies introduces
a shear multiplicative bias of the order of a few times $10^{-3}$. This value increases to the order
of $10^{-2}$ when including the clustering of the faint galaxies, as measured in the Hubble Space
Telescope Ultra Deep Field. The magnification of the faint background galaxies due to the brighter
galaxies along the line of sight is found to have a negligible impact on the multiplicative bias.
We conclude that the undetected galaxies must be included in the calibration simulations with proper
clustering properties down to magnitude 28 in order to reach a residual uncertainty on the multiplicative
shear bias calibration of a few times $10^{-4}$, in line with the $2\times10^{-3}$ total accuracy
budget required by the scientific objectives of the Euclid survey. We propose two complementary
methods for including faint galaxy clustering in the calibration simulations.
