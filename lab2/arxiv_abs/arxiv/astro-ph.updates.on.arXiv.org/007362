In this work, we have studied the variable stars in the young open cluster NGC 1893 based on a multi-year
photometric survey covering a sky area around the cluster up to $31' \times 31'$ wide. More than 23\,000
images in the $V$ band taken from January 2008 to February 2017 with different telescopes, complemented
with 90 images in the $B$ band in 2014 and 2017, were reduced, and light curves were derived in $V$ for
5653 stars. By analyzing these light curves, we detected 147 variable stars (85 of them being new
discoveries), including 110 periodic variables, 15 eclipsing binaries and 22 non-periodic variables.
Proper motions, radial velocities, color-magnitude and two-color diagrams were used to identify
the cluster membership of these variable stars, resulting in 84 members. Periodic variable members
were then classified into different variability types, mainly according to their magnitudes and
to their periods of variability, as well as to their positions in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram
for the early-type stars. As a result, among main-sequence periodic variable members, we identified
five $\beta$ Cep candidates, seven slowly pulsating B-type candidates, and thirteen fast-rotating
pulsating B-type (FaRPB) candidates (one of which is a confirmed classical Be star). While most
of the FaRPB stars display properties similar to the ones discovered in NGC 3766 by Mowlavi et al.
(2013), five of them have periods below 0.1~d, contrary to expectations. Additional observations,
including spectroscopic, are called for to further characterize these stars. We also find a binary
candidate harboring a $\delta$-Scuti candidate.
