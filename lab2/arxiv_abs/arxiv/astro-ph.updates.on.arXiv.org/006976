We present image-based evolution of galaxy mergers from the Illustris cosmological simulation
at 12 time-steps over 0.5 < z < 5. To do so, we created approximately one million synthetic deep Hubble
Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope images and measured common morphological indicators.
Using the merger tree, we assess methods to observationally select simulated mergers with stellar
mass ratios as low as 10:1 completing within 250 Myr before or after the time-step of the mock observation.
We show that common one- or two-dimensional statistics select mergers so defined with low purity
and completeness, leading to merger fraction measurements with high statistical errors. As an
alternative, we train random forests to create redshift-dependent classifiers based on 5-10 input
image diagnostics. We cross-validate and show that the random forests yield superior measurements
of the late-stage merger fraction in the simulation because they capture more mergers that occur
in bulge-dominated galaxies. We then apply these classifiers to CANDELS HST survey data, estimating
a merger rate increasing to at least z = 3 and with improved statistical errors, albeit a factor of
two higher than expected by theory. The random forests select simulated mergers with a completeness
of roughly 70% at 0.5 < z < 3, and a purity increasing from 10% at z = 0.5 to 60% at z = 3. At earlier times,
the training sets are insufficient, motivating work with larger simulations analyzed with greater
time sampling. This work demonstrates that large mock-observed cosmological simulations can
improve inferences in galaxy evolution.
