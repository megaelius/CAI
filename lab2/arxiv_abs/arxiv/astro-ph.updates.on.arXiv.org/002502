The dense neutron-rich matter found in supernovae and neutron stars is expected to form complex
nonuniform phases referred to as nuclear pasta. The pasta shapes depend on density, temperature
and proton fraction and determine many transport properties in supernovae and neutron star crusts.
We use two recently developed hybrid CPU/GPU codes to perform large scale molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations with $51200$ and $409600$ nucleons of nuclear pasta. From the output of the MD simulations
we characterize the topology and compute two observables, the radial distribution function $g(r)$
and the structure factor $S(q)$, for systems with proton fractions $Y_p=0.10, 0.20, 0.30$ and $0.40$
at about one third of nuclear saturation density and temperatures near $1.0$ MeV. We observe that
the two lowest proton fraction systems simulated, $Y_p=0.10$ and $0.20$, equilibrate quickly
and form liquid-like structures. Meanwhile, the two higher proton fraction systems, $Y_p=0.30$
and $0.40$, take a longer time to equilibrate and organize themselves in solid-like periodic structures.
Furthermore, the $Y_p=0.40$ system is made up of slabs, lasagna phase, interconnected by defects
while the $Y_p=0.30$ systems consist of a stack of perforated plates, the nuclear waffle phase.
The periodic configurations observed in our MD simulations for proton fractions $Y_p\ge0.30$
have important consequences for the structure factors $S(q)$ of protons and neutrons, which relate
to many transport properties of supernovae and neutron star crust. A detailed study of the waffle
phase and how its structure depends on temperature, size of the simulation and the screening length
showed that finite-size effects appear to be under control and, also, that the plates in the waffle
phase merge at temperatures slightly above $1.0$ MeV and the holes in the plates form an hexagonal
lattice at temperatures slightly lower than $1.0$ MeV.
