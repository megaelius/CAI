Many Type IIb supernovae (SNe) show a prominent additional early peak in their light curves, which
is generally thought to be due to the shock cooling of extended hydrogen-rich material surrounding
the helium core of the exploding star. The recent SN 2016gkg was a nearby Type IIb SN discovered shortly
after explosion, which makes it an excellent candidate for studying this first peak. We numerically
explode a large grid of extended envelope models and compare these to SN 2016gkg to investigate what
constraints can be derived from its light curve. This includes exploring density profiles for both
a convective envelope and an optically thick steady-state wind, the latter of which has not typically
been considered for Type IIb SNe models. We find that roughly $\sim0.02\,M_\odot$ of extended material
with a radius of $\approx180-260\,R_\odot$ reproduces the photometric light curve data, consistent
with pre-explosion imaging. These values are independent of the assumed density profile of this
material, although a convective profile provides a somewhat better fit. We infer from our modeling
that the explosion must have occurred within $\approx2-3\,{\rm hrs}$ of the first observed data
point, demonstrating that this event was caught very close to the moment of explosion. Nevertheless,
our best-fitting one-dimensional models overpredict the earliest velocity measurements, which
suggests that the hydrogen-rich material is not distributed in a spherically symmetric manner.
We compare this to the asymmetries seen in the SN IIb remnant Cas A, and we discuss the implications
of this for Type IIb SN progenitors and explosion models.
