In this thesis, various studies are performed leading to better understanding of the 11-year solar
cycle and its theoretical modeling with the flux transport dynamo model. Although this is primarily
a theoretical thesis, there is a part dealing with the analysis of observational data. The various
proxies of solar activity from various observatory including the sunspot area records of Kodaikanal
Observatory have been analyzed to study the irregular aspects of solar cycles and an analysis has
been carried out on the correlation between the decay rate and the next cycle amplitude. Theoretical
analysis starts with explaining how the magnetic buoyancy has been treated in the flux transport
dynamo models, and advantages and disadvantages of different treatments. It is found that some
of the irregular properties of the solar cycle in the decaying phase can only be well explained using
a particular treatment of the magnetic buoyancy. Next, the behavior of the dynamo with different
spatial structures of the meridional flow based on recent helioseismology results has been studied.
A theoretical model is constructed considering the back reaction due to the Lorentz force on the
meridional flows which explains the observed variation of the meridional flow with the solar cycle.
Finally, some results with 3D FTD models are presented. This 3D model is developed to handle the Babcock-Leighton
mechanism and magnetic buoyancy more realistically than previous 2D models and can capture some
important effects connected with the subduction of the magnetic field in polar regions, which are
missed in 2D surface flux transport models. This 3D model is further used to study the evolution of
the magnetic fields due to a turbulent non-axisymmetric velocity field and to compare the results
with the results obtained by using a simple turbulent diffusivity coefficient.
