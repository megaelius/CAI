Since the first report of a potentially non-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) in its dayside atmosphere,
the highly irradiated exoplanet WASP-12b has been under intense scrutiny and the subject of many
follow-up observations. Additionally, the recent discovery of stellar binary companions ~1"
from WASP-12 has obfuscated interpretation of the observational data. Here we present new ground-based
multi-object transmission-spectroscopy observations of WASP-12b that we acquired over two consecutive
nights in the red optical with Gemini-N/GMOS. After correcting for the influence of WASP-12's stellar
companions, we find that these data rule out a cloud-free, H2 atmosphere with no additional opacity
sources. We detect features in the transmission spectrum that may be attributed to metal oxides
(such as TiO and VO) for an O-rich atmosphere or to metal hydrides (such as TiH) for a C-rich atmosphere.
We also reanalyzed NIR transit-spectroscopy observations of WASP-12b from HST/WFC3 and broadband
transit photometry from Warm Spitzer. We attribute the broad spectral features in the WFC3 data
to either H2O or CH4 and HCN for an O-rich or C-rich atmosphere, respectively. The Spitzer data suggest
shallower transit depths than the models predict at infrared wavelengths, albeit at low statistical
significance. A multi-instrument, broad-wavelength analysis of WASP-12b suggests that the transmission
spectrum is well approximated by a simple Rayleigh scattering model with a planet terminator temperature
of 1870 +/- 130 K. We conclude that additional high-precision data and isolated spectroscopic measurements
of the companion stars are required to place definitive constraints on the composition of WASP-12b's
atmosphere.
