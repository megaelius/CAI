We examine the evolution of assembly bias using a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation implemented
in the Millennium-WMAP7 N-body simulation. We consider fixed number density galaxy samples ranked
by stellar mass or star formation rate. We investigate how the clustering of haloes and their galaxy
content depend on halo formation time and concentration, and how these relationships evolve with
redshift. At $z=0$ the dependences of halo clustering on halo concentration and formation time
are similar. However, at higher redshift, halo assembly bias weakens for haloes selected by age,
and reverses and increases for haloes selected by concentration. The variation of the halo occupation
with concentration and formation time is also similar at $z=0$ and changes at higher redshifts.
In this case, the occupancy variation with halo age stays mostly constant with redshift but decreases
for concentration. Finally, we look at the evolution of assembly bias reflected in the galaxy distribution
by examining the galaxy correlation functions relative to those of shuffled galaxy samples which
remove the occupancy variation. This correlation functions ratio monotonically decreases with
larger redshift and for lower number density samples, going below unity in some cases, leading to
reduced galaxy clustering. While the halo occupation functions themselves vary, the assembly
bias trends are similar whether selecting galaxies by stellar mass or star formation rate. Our results
provide further insight into the origin and evolution of assembly bias. Our extensive occupation
function measurements and fits are publicly available and can be used to create realistic mock catalogues.
