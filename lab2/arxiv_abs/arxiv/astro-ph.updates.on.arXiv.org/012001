The {\alpha}-element abundances of the globular cluster (GC) and field star populations of galaxies
encode information about the formation of each of these components. We use the E-MOSAICS cosmological
simulations of ~L* galaxies and their GCs to investigate the [{\alpha}/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution
of field stars and GCs in 25 Milky Way-mass galaxies. The [{\alpha}/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution go
GCs largely follows that of the field stars and can also therefore be used as tracers of the [{\alpha}/Fe]-[Fe/H]
evolution of the galaxy. Due to the difference in their star formation histories, GCs associated
with stellar streams (i.e. which have recently been accreted) have systematically lower [{\alpha}/Fe]
at fixed [Fe/H]. Therefore, if a GC is observed to have low [{\alpha}/Fe] for its [Fe/H] there is an
increased probability that this GC was accreted recently alongside a dwarf galaxy. There is a wide
range of shapes for the field star [{\alpha}/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution, with a notable subset of
galaxies exhibiting bimodal distributions, in which the high [{\alpha}/Fe] sequence is mostly
comprised of stars in the bulge, a high fraction of which are from disrupted GCs. We calculate the
contribution of disrupted GCs to the bulge component of the 25 simulated galaxies and find values
between 0.3-14 per cent, where this fraction correlates with the galaxy's formation time. The upper
range of these fractions is compatible with observationally-inferred measurements for the Milky
Way, suggesting that in this respect the Milky Way is not typical of L* galaxies, having experienced
a phase of unusually rapid growth at early times.
