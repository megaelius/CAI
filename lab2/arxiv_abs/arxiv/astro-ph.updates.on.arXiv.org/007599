We investigate galactic winds driven by supernova (SN) explosions in an isolated dwarf galaxy using
high-resolution (particle mass $m_{\rm gas} = 1{\rm M_\odot}$, number of neighbor $N_{\rm ngb}
= 100$) smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations that include non-equilibrium cooling and
chemistry, individual star formation, stellar feedback and metal enrichment. Clustered SNe lead
to the formation of superbubbles which break out of the disk and vent out hot gas, launching the winds.
We find much weaker winds than what cosmological simulations typically adopt at this mass scale.
At the virial radius, the time-averaged loading factors of mass, momentum and energy are 3, 1 and
0.05, respectively, and the metal enrichment factor is 1.5. Winds that escape the halo consist of
two populations that differ in their launching temperatures. Hot gas acquires enough kinetic energy
to escape when launched while warm gas does not. However, warm gas can be further accelerated by the
ram pressure of the subsequently launched hot gas and eventually escape. The strong interactions
between different temperature phases highlight the caveat of extrapolating properties of warm
gas to large distances based on its local conditions (e.g. the Bernoulli parameter). Our convergence
study finds that wind properties converge when the cooling masses of individual SNe are resolved,
which corresponds to $m_{\rm gas}=5 {\rm M_\odot}$ with an injection mass of $500 {\rm M_\odot}$.
The winds weaken dramatically once the SNe become unresolved. We demonstrate that injecting the
terminal momentum of SNe, a popular sub-grid model in the literature, fails to capture SN winds irrespective
of the inclusion of residual thermal energy.
