With Gaia Data Release 2, the astronomical community is entering a new era of multidimensional surveys
of the Milky Way. This new phase-space view of our Galaxy demands new tools for comparing observations
to simulations of Milky-Way-mass galaxies in a cosmological context, to test the physics of both
dark matter and galaxy formation. We present ananke, a framework for generating synthetic phase-space
surveys from high-resolution baryonic simulations, and use it to generate a suite of synthetic
surveys resembling Gaia DR2 in data structure, magnitude limits, and observational errors. We
use three cosmological simulations of Milky-Way-mass galaxies from the Latte suite of the Feedback
In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project, which feature self-consistent clustering of star formation
in dense molecular clouds and thin stellar/gaseous disks in live cosmological halos with satellite
dwarf galaxies and stellar halos. We select three solar viewpoints from each simulation to generate
nine synthetic Gaia-like surveys. We sample synthetic stars by assuming each star particle (of
mass 7070 $M_{\odot}$) represents a single stellar population. At each viewpoint, we compute dust
extinction from the simulated gas metallicity distribution and apply a simple error model to produce
a synthetic Gaia-like survey that includes both observational properties and a pointer to the generating
star particle. We provide the complete simulation snapshot at $z = 0$ for each simulated galaxy.
We describe data access points, the data model, and plans for future upgrades. These synthetic surveys
provide a tool for the scientific community to test analysis methods and interpret Gaia data.
