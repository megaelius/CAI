We have generated synthetic images of $\sim$27,000 galaxies from the IllustrisTNG and the original
Illustris hydrodynamic cosmological simulations, designed to match Pan-STARRS observations
of $\log_{10}(M_{\ast}/{\rm M}_{\odot}) \approx 9.8$-$11.3$ galaxies at $z \approx 0.05$. Most
of our synthetic images were created with the SKIRT radiative transfer code, including the effects
of dust attenuation and scattering, and performing the radiative transfer directly on the Voronoi
mesh used by the simulations themselves. We have analysed both our synthetic and real Pan-STARRS
images with the newly developed $\tt{statmorph}$ code, which calculates non-parametric morphological
diagnostics -- including the Gini-$M_{20}$ and concentration-asymmetry-smoothness (CAS) statistics
-- and performs two-dimensional S\'ersic fits. Overall, we find that the optical morphologies
of IllustrisTNG galaxies are in good agreement with observations, and represent a substantial
improvement compared to the original Illustris simulation. In particular, the locus of the Gini-$M_{20}$
diagram is consistent with that inferred from observations, while the median trends with stellar
mass of all the morphological, size and shape parameters considered in this work lie within the $\sim$1$\sigma$
scatter of the observational trends. However, the IllustrisTNG model has some difficulty with
more stringent tests, such as producing a strong morphology-colour relation. This results in a
somewhat higher fraction of red discs and blue spheroids compared to observations. Similarly,
the morphology-size relation is problematic: while observations show that discs tend to be larger
than spheroids at a fixed stellar mass, such a trend is not present in IllustrisTNG.
