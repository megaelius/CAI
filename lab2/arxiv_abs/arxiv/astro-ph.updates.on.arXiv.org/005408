The influence of a toroidal magnetic field on the dynamics of shallow water waves in the solar tachocline
is studied. A sub-adiabatic temperature gradient in the upper overshoot layer of the tachocline
causes significant reduction of surface gravity speed, which leads to trapping of the waves near
the equator and to an increase of the Rossby wave period up to the timescale of solar cycles. Dispersion
relations of all equatorial magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shallow water waves are obtained in the
upper tachocline conditions and solved analytically and numerically. It is found that the toroidal
magnetic field splits equatorial Rossby and Rossby-gravity waves into fast and slow modes. For
a reasonable value of reduced gravity, global equatorial fast magneto-Rossby waves (with the spatial
scale of equatorial extent) have a periodicity of 11 years, matching the timescale of activity cycles.
The solutions are confined around the equator between latitudes 20-40, coinciding with sunspot
activity belts. Equatorial slow magneto-Rossby waves have a periodicity of 90-100 yr, resembling
the observed long-term modulation of cycle strength, i.e., the Gleissberg cycle. Equatorial magneto-Kelvin
and slow magneto-Rossby-gravity waves have the periodicity of 1-2 years and may correspond to observed
annual and quasi-biennial oscillations. Equatorial fast magneto-Rossby-gravity and magneto-inertia-gravity
waves have periods of hundreds of days and might be responsible for observed Rieger-type periodicity.
Consequently, the equatorial MHD shallow water waves in the upper overshoot tachocline may capture
all timescales of observed variations in solar activity, but detailed analytical and numerical
studies are necessary to make a firm conclusion toward the connection of the waves to the solar dynamo.
