Searches for continuous gravitational waves from rapidly spinning neutron stars normally assume
that the star rotates about one of its principal axes of moment of inertia, and hence the gravitational
radiation emits only at twice the spin frequency of the star, $2f_*$. The superfluid interior of
a star pinned to the crust along an axis nonaligned with any of its principal axes allows the star to
emit gravitational waves at both $f_*$ and $2f_*$, even without free precession, a phenomenon not
clearly observed in known pulsars. The dual-harmonic emission mechanism motivates searches combining
the two frequency components of a signal to improve signal-to-noise ratio. We describe an economical,
semicoherent, dual-harmonic search method, combined with a maximum likelihood coherent matched
filter, F-statistic, and improved from an existing hidden Markov model (HMM) tracking scheme to
track two frequency components simultaneously. We validate the method and demonstrate its performance
through Monte Carlo simulations. We find that for sources emitting gravitational waves at both
$f_*$ and $2f_*$, the rate of correctly recovering synthetic signals (i.e., detection efficiency),
at a given false alarm probability, can be improved by $\sim 10$%-70% by tracking two frequencies
simultaneously compared to tracking a single component only. For sources emitting at $2f_*$ only,
dual-harmonic tracking only leads to minor sensitivity loss, producing $\lesssim 10\%$ lower
detection efficiency than tracking a single component. In directed continuous-wave searches
where $f_*$ is unknown and hence the full frequency band is searched, the computationally efficient
HMM tracking algorithm provides an option of conducting both the dual-harmonic search and the conventional
single frequency tracking to obtain optimal sensitivity, with a typical run time of $\sim 10^3$
core-hr for one year's observation.
