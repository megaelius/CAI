It has been proposed that the mass-metallicity relation of galaxies exhibits a secondary dependence
on star formation rate (SFR), and that the resulting M-Z-SFR relation may be redshift-invariant,
i.e., "fundamental." However, conflicting results on the character of the SFR dependence, and
whether it exists, have been reported. To gain insight into the origins of the conflicting results,
we (a) devise a non-parametric, astrophysically-motivated analysis framework based on the offset
from the star-forming ("main") sequence at a given stellar mass (relative specific SFR), (b) apply
this methodology and perform a comprehensive re-analysis of the local M-Z-SFR relation, based
on SDSS, GALEX, and WISE data, and (c) study the impact of sample selection, and of using different
metallicity and SFR indicators. We show that metallicity is anti-correlated with specific SFR
regardless of the indicators used. We do not find that the relation is spurious due to correlations
arising from biased metallicity measurements, or fiber aperture effects. We emphasize that the
dependence is weak/absent for massive galaxies ($\log M_*>10.5$), and that the overall scatter
in the M-Z-SFR relation does not greatly decrease from the M-Z relation. We find that the dependence
is stronger for the highest SSFR galaxies above the star-forming sequence. This two-mode behavior
can be described with a broken linear fit in 12+log(O/H) vs. log (SFR$/M_*$), at a given $M_*$. Previous
parameterizations used for comparative analysis with higher redshift samples that do not account
for the more detailed behavior of the local M-Z-SFR relation may incorrectly lead to the conclusion
that those samples follow a different relationship.
