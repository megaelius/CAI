In this paper are discussed possible many body generalizations of the expanding locally anisotropic
metric ansatz with respect to approximately Newtonian gravitational systems. This ansatz consistently
describes local point-like matter distributions on the expanding Universe also allowing for a
covariant parameterization of gravitational interactions at intermediate length scales. As
an example of applicability it is modeled a disk galaxy model matching the physical parameters of
the galaxy UGC2885 and it is shown that, by fine-tuning the metric functional parameter, the flattening
of the galaxy rotation curve is fully parameterized by this metric. In addition it is numerically
computed the mass-energy density corrections due to the expanding anisotropic background and
explicitly shown that although there are negative contributions within the galaxy plane the total
mass-energy density is strictly positive both at the galaxy plane and outside the galaxy plane.
As the functional parameter for this metric is an exponential factor is required a floating point
precision of $250$ significant digits for root finding routines and $200$ significant digits to
evaluate the effective mass-energy density rendering a final precision of the results presented
above double precision ($16$ significant digits). It is further shown that these results are consistent
with the interpretation of the gravitational corrections as due to Dark Matter, in particular constituting
a novel heuristic local parameterization for the Dark Matter distribution within the galaxy plane
consistent with both local scale and cosmological scale physical laws which is useful to further
investigate the local properties of Dark Matter.
