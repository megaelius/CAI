We use the semi-analytic model of galaxy formation SAG to study the relevance of mass and environmental
quenching on satellite galaxies. We find that environmental processes dominate the star formation
(SF) quenching of low-mass satellites ($M_{\star} \lesssim 10^{10.5}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$), whereas
high-mass galaxies typically quench as centrals. High-mass galaxies that remain actively forming
stars while being accreted are found to be mainly affected by mass quenching after their first infall.
For a given stellar mass, our model predicts SF quenching to be less efficient in low-mass haloes
both before and after infall, in contradiction with common interpretations of observational data.
Our model supports a two-stage scenario to explain the SF quenching. Initially, the SF of satellites
resembles that of centrals until the gas cooling rate is reduced to approximately half its value
at infall. Then, the SF fades through secular processes that exhaust the cold gas reservoir. This
reservoir is not replenished efficiently due to the action of either ram-pressure stripping (RPS)
of the hot gas in low-mass satellites, or feedback from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in high-mass
satellites. The delay times for the onset of SF quenching are found to range from $\approx 3\,{\rm
Gyr}$ to $\approx 1\,{\rm Gyr}$ for low-mass ($M_{\star} \approx 10^{10}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$)
and high-mass ($M_{\star} \approx 10^{11}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$) satellites, respectively. SF
fades in $\approx 1.5\,{\rm Gyr}$, largely independent of stellar mass. We find that the SF quenching
of low-mass satellites supports the so-called delay-then-rapid quenching scenario. However,
the SF history of $z=0$ passive satellites of any stellar mass is better described by a delay-then-fade
quenching scenario.
