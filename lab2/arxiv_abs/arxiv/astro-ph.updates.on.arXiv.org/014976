It has been established for decades that rotation curves deviate from the Newtonian gravity expectation
given baryons alone below a characteristic acceleration scale $g_{\dagger}\sim 10^{-8}\,\rm{cm\,s^{-2}}$,
a scale promoted to a new fundamental constant in MOND. In recent years, theoretical and observational
studies have shown that the star formation efficiency (SFE) of dense gas scales with surface density,
SFE $\sim \Sigma/\Sigma_{\rm crit}$ with $\Sigma_{\rm crit} \sim \langle\dot{p}/m_{\ast}\rangle/(\pi\,G)\sim
1000\,\rm{M_{\odot}\,pc^{-2}}$ (where $\langle \dot{p}/m_{\ast}\rangle$ is the momentum
flux output by stellar feedback per unit stellar mass in a young stellar population). We argue that
the SFE, more generally, should scale with the local gravitational acceleration, i.e. that SFE
$\sim g_{\rm tot}g_\mathrm{crit} \equiv (G\,M_{\rm tot}/R^{2}) / \langle\dot{p}/m_{\ast}\rangle$,
where $M_{\rm tot}$ is the total gravitating mass and $g_\mathrm{crit}=\langle\dot{p}/m_{\ast}\rangle
= \pi\,G\,\Sigma_{\rm crit} \approx 10^{-8}\,\rm{cm\,s^{-2}} \approx g_{\dagger}$. Hence
the observed $g_\dagger$ may correspond to the characteristic acceleration scale above which
stellar feedback cannot prevent efficient star formation, and baryons will eventually come to
dominate. We further show how this may give rise to the observed acceleration scaling $g_{\rm obs}\sim(g_{\rm
baryon}\,g_{\dagger})^{1/2}$ (where $g_{\rm baryon}$ is the acceleration due to baryons alone)
and flat rotation curves. The derived characteristic acceleration $g_{\dagger}$ can be expressed
in terms of fundamental constants (gravitational constant, proton mass, and Thomson cross section):
$g_{\dagger}\sim 0.1\,G\,m_{p}/\sigma_{\rm T}$.
