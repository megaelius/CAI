Aims. Several kinematic and chemical substructures have been recently found amongst Milky Way
halo stars with retrograde motions. It is currently unclear how these various structures are related
to each other. This Letter aims to shed light on this issue. Methods. We explore the retrograde halo
with an augmented version of the Gaia DR2 RVS sample, extended with data from three large spectroscopic
surveys, namely RAVE, APOGEE and LAMOST. In this dataset, we identify several structures using
the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm. We discuss their properties and possible links using all the
available chemical and dynamical information. Results. In concordance with previous work, we
find that stars with [Fe/H] $<-1$ have more retrograde motions than those with [Fe/H] $>-1$. The
retrograde halo contains a mixture of debris from objects like Gaia-Enceladus, Sequoia, and even
the chemically defined thick-disc. We find that the Sequoia has a smaller range in orbital energies
than previously suggested and is confined to high-energy. Sequoia could be a small galaxy in itself,
but since it overlaps both in integrals-of-motion space and chemical abundance space with the less
bound debris of Gaia-Enceladus, its nature cannot be fully settled yet. In the low-energy part of
the halo we find evidence for at least one more distinct structure: Thamnos. Stars in Thamnos are
on low inclination, mildly eccentric retrograde orbits, moving at $v_{\phi}\approx-150$ km/s,
and are chemically distinct from the other structures. Conclusions. Even with the excellent Gaia
DR2 data it remains challenging to piece together all the fragments found in the retrograde halo.
At this point, we are very much in need of large datasets with high-quality high-resolution spectra
and tailored high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy mergers.
