Aims: It is well known that the presence of baryons affects the dark matter host haloes. Exploring
the galaxy assembly history together with the dark matter haloes properties through time can provide
a way to measure these effects. Methods: We study the properties of four Milky Way mass dark matter
haloes from the Aquarius project during their assembly history, between $z = 0 - 4$. In this work,
we use the SPH run from Scannapieco et al. (2009) and the dark matter only counterpart as case studies.
To asses the robustness of our findings, we compare them with one of the haloes run using a moving-mesh
technique and different sub-grid scheme. Results: Our results show that the cosmic evolution of
the dark matter halo profiles depends on the assembly history of the baryons. We find that the dark
matter profiles do not significantly change with time, hence they become stable, when the fraction
of baryons accumulated in the central regions reaches 80 percent of its present mass within the virial
radius. Furthermore, the mass accretion history shows that the haloes that assembled earlier are
those that contain a larger amount of baryonic mass aforetime, which in turn allows the dark matter
halo profiles to reach a stable configuration earlier. For the SPH haloes, we find that the specific
angular momentum of the dark matter particles within the five percent of the virial radius at z = 0,
remains approximately constant from the time at which 60 percent of the stellar mass is gathered.
We explore different theoretical and empirical models for the contraction of the haloes through
redshift. A model to better describe the contraction of the haloes through redshift evolution must
depend on the stellar mass content in the inner regions.
