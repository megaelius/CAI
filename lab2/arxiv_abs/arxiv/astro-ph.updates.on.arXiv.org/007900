Testing the true nature of black holes - the no-hair hypothesis - will become increasingly more precise
in the next few years as new observational data is collected in both the gravitational wave channel
and the electromagnetic channel. In this paper we consider numerically generated spacetimes of
Kerr black holes with synchronised scalar hair and build stationary models of magnetized thick
disks (or tori) around them. Our approach assumes that the disks are not self-gravitating, they
obey a polytropic equation of state, the distribution of their specific angular momentum is constant,
and they are marginally stable, i.e. the disks completely fill their Roche lobe. Moreover, contrary
to existing approaches in the literature, our models are thermodinamically relativist, as the
specific enthalpy of the fluid can adopt values significantly larger than unity. We study the dependence
of the morphology and properties of the accretion tori on the type of black hole considered, from
purely Kerr black holes with varying degrees of spin parameter, namely from a Schwarzschild black
hole to a nearly extremal Kerr case, to Kerr black holes with scalar hair with different ADM mass and
horizon angular velocity. Comparisons between the disk properties for both types of black holes
are presented. The sequences of magnetized, equilibrium disks models discussed in this study can
be used as initial data for numerical relativity codes to investigate their dynamical (non-linear)
stability and used in tandem with ray-tracing codes to obtain synthetic images of black holes (i.e.
shadows) in astrophysically relevant situations where the light source is provided by an emitting
accretion disk.
