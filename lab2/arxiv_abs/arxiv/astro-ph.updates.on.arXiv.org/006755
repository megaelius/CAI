Intermediate-mass (IM) protostars provide a bridge between the low- and high-mass protostars.
Despite their relevance, little is known about their chemical diversity. We want to investigate
the molecular richness towards the envelope of IM protostars and to compare their properties with
other sources. We have selected the isolated IM Class 0 protostar CepE-mm to carry out an unbiased
molecular survey with the IRAM 30m telescope between 72 and 350 GHz with an angular resolution lying
in the range 7-34". These data were complemented with NOEMA observations of the spectral bands 85.9
- 89.6 GHz and 216.8 - 220.4 GHz at an angular resolution of 2.3 and 1.4", respectively. 30m spectra
show bright emission of O- and N-bearing COMs. We identify three components in the spectral signature:
an extremely broad line component associated with the outflowing gas, a narrow line component associated
with the cold envelope, and a broad line component tracing the hot corino. NOEMA observations reveal
CepE-mm as a binary protostellar system CepE-A and B, separated by 1.7". CepE-A dominates the core
continuum emission and powers the high-velocity jet associated with HH377. Our interferometric
maps show that COMs arises from a region of 0.7" size around CepE-A. Rotational temperatures were
found to lie in the range 20-40 K with column densities ranging from a few 10^15 cm-2 for O-bearing
species, down to a few 10^14 cm-2 for N-bearing species. Molecular abundances are similar to those
measured towards other low- and intermediate-mass protostars. High-mass hot cores are significantly
less abundant in methanol and N-bearing species are more abundant by 3 orders of magnitude.CepE-mm
reveals itself as a binary protostellar system with a strong chemical differentiation. The brightest
component of the binary is associated with a hot corino. Its properties are similar to those of low-mass
hot corinos.
