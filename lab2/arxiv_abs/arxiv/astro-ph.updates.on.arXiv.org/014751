We conduct a quantitative analysis of the star formation history (SFH) of the Milky Way's bulge by
exploiting the constraining power of its stellar [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] distribution functions. Using
APOGEE data, we confirm the previously-established bimodal [Mg/Fe]--[Fe/H] distribution within
3 kpc of the inner Galaxy. Compared to that in the solar vicinity, the high-$\alpha$ population in
the bulge peaks at a lower [Fe/H]. To fit these observations, we use a simple but flexible star formation
framework, which assumes two distinct stages of gas accretion and star formation, and systematically
evaluate a wide multi-dimensional parameter space. We find that the data favor a three-phase SFH
that consists of an initial starburst, followed by a rapid star formation quenching episode and
a lengthy, quiescent secular evolution phase. The metal-poor, high-$\alpha$ bulge stars ([Fe/H]<0.0
and [Mg/Fe]>0.15) are formed rapidly (<2 Gyr) during the early starburst. The density gap between
the high- and low-$\alpha$ sequences is due to the quenching process. The metal-rich, low-$\alpha$
population ([Fe/H]>0.0 and [Mg/Fe]<0.15) then accumulates gradually through inefficient star
formation during the secular phase. This is qualitatively consistent with the early SFH of the inner
disk. Given this scenario, a notable fraction of young stars (age<5 Gyr) is expected to persist in
the bulge. Combined with extragalactic observations, these results suggest that a rapid star formation
quenching process is responsible for bimodal distributions in both the Milky Way's stellar populations
and in the general galaxy population and thus plays a critical role in galaxy evolution.
