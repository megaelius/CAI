The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite will conduct a 2-year long wide-field survey searching
for transiting planets around bright stars. Many TESS discoveries will be amenable to mass characterization
via ground-based radial velocity measurements with any of a growing suite of existing and anticipated
velocimeters in the optical and near-infrared. In this study we present an analytical formalism
to compute the number of radial velocity measurements---and hence the total observing time---required
to characterize RV planet masses with the inclusion of either a white or correlated noise activity
model. We use our model to calculate the total observing time required to measure all TESS planet
masses from the expected TESS planet yield while relying on our current understanding of the targeted
stars, stellar activity, and populations of unseen planets which inform the expected radial velocity
precision. We also present specialized calculations applicable to a variety of interesting TESS
planet subsets including the characterization of 50 planets smaller than 4 Earth radii which is
expected to take as little as 60 nights of observation. Although, the efficient RV characterization
of such planets requires a-priori knowledge of the `best' targets which we argue can be identified
prior to the conclusion of the TESS planet search based on our calculations. Our results highlight
the comparable performance of optical and near-IR spectrographs for most planet populations except
for Earths and temperate TESS planets which are more efficiently characterized in the near-IR.
Lastly, we present an online tool to the community to compute the total observing times required
to detect any transiting planet using a user-defined spectrograph.
