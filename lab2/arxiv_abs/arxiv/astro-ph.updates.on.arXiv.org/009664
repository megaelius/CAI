In this paper, we explore the behavior of optical polarization during the multi-wavelength outburst
of the blazar Mrk 421 detected in February 2010. We use optical polarization measurements in the
wavelength range 500-700 nm from SPOL observations available between January 1, 2010 and March
31, 2010 (MJD 55197-55286) including the period of multi-wavelength flaring activity detected
from the source around February 16-17, 2010 (MJD 55243-55244). We also use near simultaneous optical
and radio flux measurements from SPOL in V and R bands and OVRO at 15 GHz respectively. We find that
the emissions in the optical and radio bands do not show any significant change in the source activity
unlike at X-ray and $\gamma$--ray energies during the outburst. The optical and radio flux measurements
are found to be consistent with the long term quiescent state emission of the source. Moreover, the
linear polarization in the wavelength range 500-700 nm decreases to a minimum value of 1.6$\%$ during
the X-ray and $\gamma$--ray outburst which is significantly lower than the long term average value
of $\sim$ 4.2$\%$. The angle of polarization varies between 114$^\circ$-163$^\circ$ with a preferred
average value of $\sim$ 137$^\circ$ during this period. We estimate the degree of polarization
intrinsic to the jet taking into account the host galaxy contamination in R band and compare this
with the theoretical synchrotron polarization estimated for a power law distribution of relativistic
electrons gyrating in an emission region filled with ordered and chaotic magnetic fields. The intrinsic
linear polarization estimated for different epochs during the above period is found to be consistent
with the theoretical synchrotron polarization produced by the relativistic electrons with power
law spectral index $\sim$ 2.2.
