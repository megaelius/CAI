(abridged) We want to provide further evidence of the origin of the proposed stellar members of Chamaeleon
and to identify interlopers from the foreground \epsilon Cha and \eta Cha associations. To this
aim, we compile lists of spectroscopically confirmed members of Chamaeleon I and II, \epsilon Cha
and \eta Cha, and of background objects in the same line of sight. Using Virtual Observatory tools,
we cross-match these lists with the UCAC3 catalogue to get the proper motions of the objects. In the
vector point diagram, we identify the different moving groups, and use this information to study
the membership of proposed candidate members of the associations from the literature. For those
objects with available radial velocities, we compute their Galactic space velocities. We look
for correlations between the known properties of the objects and their proper motions. The members
of the dark clouds exhibit clearly different proper motions from those of the foreground associations
and of the background stars. The data suggest that Chamaeleon II could have different dynamical
properties from Chamaeleon I. Although the two foreground clusters \epsilon and \eta Chamaeleontis
constitute two different proper motion groups, they have similar spatial motions, which are different
from the spatial motion of Chamaeleon I. On the other hand, the space motions of the Chamaeleon II
stars look more similar to those of the foreground clusters than to the Chamaeleon I stars, but the
numbers are low. Hence, with the available data it is unclear to what extent the stellar populations
in both clouds are physically connected to each other. We find no correlations between the proper
motions and the properties of the objects in either of the clouds.
