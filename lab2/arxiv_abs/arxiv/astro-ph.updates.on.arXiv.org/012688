We present a sample of 151 massive ($M_* > 10^{10}\mathrm{M_\odot}$) quiescent galaxies at $2 <
z < 5$, based on a sophisticated Bayesian spectral energy distribution fitting analysis of the CANDELS
UDS and GOODS-South fields. Our sample includes a robust sub-sample of 61 objects for which we confidently
exclude low-redshift and star-forming solutions. We identify 10 robust objects at $z>3$, of which
2 are at $z>4$. We report formation redshifts, demonstrating that the oldest objects formed at $z
> 6$, however individual ages from our photometric data have significant uncertainties, typically
$\sim0.5$ Gyr. We demonstrate that the UVJ colours of the quiescent population evolve with redshift
at $z>3$, becoming bluer and more similar to post-starburst galaxies at lower redshift. Based upon
this we construct a model for the time-evolution of quiescent galaxy UVJ colours, concluding that
the oldest objects are consistent with forming the bulk of their stellar mass at $z\sim6-7$ and quenching
at $z\sim5$. We report spectroscopic redshifts for two of our objects at $z=3.440$ and $3.396$,
which exhibit extremely weak Ly$\alpha$ emission in ultra-deep VANDELS spectra. We calculate
star-formation rates based on these line fluxes, finding that these galaxies are consistent with
our quiescent selection criteria, provided their Ly$\alpha$ escape fractions are $>3$ and $>10$
per cent respectively. We finally report that our highest-redshift robust object exhibits a continuum
break at $\lambda\sim7000$A in a spectrum from VUDS, consistent with our photometric redshift
of $z_\mathrm{phot}=4.72^{+0.06}_{-0.04}$. If confirmed this object would be the highest-redshift
known quiescent galaxy. In order to obtain stronger constraints on the times of the earliest quenching
events, high-SNR spectroscopy must be extended to $z\gtrsim3$ quiescent objects.
