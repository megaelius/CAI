Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA) cannot efficiently accelerate particles without the presence
of self-consistently generated or pre-existing strong turbulence ($ \delta B/B \sim 1 $) in the
vicinity of the shock. The problem we address in this article is: if large amplitude magnetic disturbances
are present upstream and downstream of a shock then Turbulent Reconnection (TR) will set in and will
participate not only in the elastic scattering of particles but also in their heating and acceleration.
We demonstrate that large amplitude magnetic disturbances and Unstable Current Sheets (UCS),
spontaneously formed in the strong turbulence in the vicinity of a shock, can accelerate particles
as efficiently as DSA in {\bf large scale systems and on long time scales}. We start our analysis with
"elastic" scatterers upstream and downstream and estimate the energy distribution of particles
escaping from the shock, recovering the well known results from the DSA theory. Next we analyze the
additional interaction of the particles with active scatterers (magnetic disturbances and UCS)
upstream and downstream of the shock. We show that the asymptotic energy distribution of the particles
accelerated by DSA/TR has very similar characteristics with the one due to DSA alone, but the synergy
of DSA with TR is much more efficient: The acceleration time is an order of magnitude shorter and the
maximum energy reached two orders of magnitude higher. We claim that DSA is the dominant acceleration
mechanism in a short period before TR is established, and then strong turbulence will dominate the
heating and acceleration of the particles. In other words, the shock serves as the mechanism to set
up a strongly turbulent environment, in which the acceleration mechanism will ultimately be the
synergy of DSA and TR.
