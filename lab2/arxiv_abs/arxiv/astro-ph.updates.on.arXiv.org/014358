The cosmic thermal history, quantified by the evolution of the mean thermal energy density in the
universe, is driven by the growth of structures as baryons get shock-heated in collapsing dark matter
halos. This process can be probed by redshift-dependent amplitudes of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich
(SZ) effect background. To do so, we cross-correlate eight sky intensity maps in the $\it{Planck}$
and Infrared Astronomical Satellite missions with two million spectroscopic-redshift references
in the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys. This delivers snapshot spectra for the far-infrared to microwave
background light as a function of redshift up to $z\sim3$. We decompose them into the SZ and thermal
dust components. Our SZ measurements directly constrain $\langle bP_{\rm e} \rangle$, the halo
bias-weighted mean electron pressure, up to $z\sim 1$. This is the highest redshift achieved to
date, with uncorrelated redshift bins thanks to the spectroscopic references. We detect a threefold
increase in the density-weighted mean electron temperature $\bar{T}_{\rm{e}}$ from $7\times
10^5~{\rm K}$ at $z=1$ to $2\times 10^6~{\rm K}$ today. Over $z=1$-$0$, we witness the build up of
nearly $70\%$ of the present-day mean thermal energy density $\rho_{\rm{th}}$, with the corresponding
density parameter $\Omega_{\rm th}$ reaching $1.5 \times10^{-8}$. We find the mass bias parameter
of $\it{Planck}$'s universal pressure profile of $B=1.27$ (or $1-b=1/B=0.79$), consistent with
the magnitude of non-thermal pressure in gas motion and turbulence from mass assembly. We estimate
the redshift-integrated mean Compton parameter $y\sim1.2\times10^{-6}$, which will be tested
by future spectral distortion experiments. More than half of which originates from large-scale
structure at $z<1$, which we detect directly.
