I present a set of long-term, direct, relativistic many-body computations of model dense stellar
clusters with up-to-date stellar-evolutionary, supernova (SN), and remnant natal-kick models,
including pair instability and pulsation pair instability supernova (PSN and PPSN), using an updated
version of NBODY7 N-body simulation program. The N-body model also includes stellar evolution-based
natal spins of BHs and treatments of binary black hole (BBH) mergers based on numerical relativity.
These, for the first time in a direct N-body simulation, allow for second-generation BBH mergers.
The set of 65 evolutionary models have initial masses $10^4M_\odot-10^5M_\odot$, sizes 1 pc-3
pc, metallicity $0.0001-0.02$, with the massive stars in primordial binaries and they represent
young massive clusters (YMC) and moderately massive open clusters (OC). Such models produce dynamically-paired
BBH mergers that agree well with the observed masses, mass ratios, effective spin parameters, and
final spins of the LVC O1/O2 merger events, provided BHs are born with low or no spin but spin up after
undergoing a BBH merger or matter accretion onto it. In particular, the distinctly higher mass,
effective spin parameter, and final spin of GW170729 merger event is naturally reproduced, as also
the mass asymmetry of the O3 event GW190412. The computed models produce massive, $\sim100M_\odot$
BBH mergers with primary mass within the 'PSN gap' and also yield mergers involving remnants in the
'mass gap'. They also suggest that YMCs and OCs produce persistent, Local-Universe GW sources detectable
by LISA. Such clusters are also capable of producing eccentric LIGO-Virgo mergers.
