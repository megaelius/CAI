We study the evolution of the observed photospheric magnetic field and the modeled global coronal
magnetic field during the past 3 1/2 solar activity cycles observed since the mid-1970s. We use synoptic
magnetograms and extrapolated potential-field models based on longitudinal full-disk photospheric
magnetograms from the NSO's three magnetographs at Kitt Peak, the Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations
of the Sun (SOLIS) vector spectro-magnetograph (VSM), the spectro-magnetograph and the 512-channel
magnetograph instruments, and from the U. Stanford's Wilcox Solar Observatory. The associated
multipole field components are used to study the dominant length scales and symmetries of the coronal
field. Polar field changes are found to be well correlated with active fields over most of the period
studied, except between 2003-6 when the active fields did not produce significant polar field changes.
Of the axisymmetric multipoles, only the dipole and octupole follow the poles whereas the higher
orders follow the activity cycle. All non-axisymmetric multipole strengths are well correlated
with the activity cycle. The tilt of the solar dipole is therefore almost entirely due to active-region
fields. The axial dipole is the largest contributor to the global field except when the polar fields
reverse. According to the Computer Aided CME Tracking (CACTus) and Nobeyama radioheliograph prominence
eruption catalogs, the rate of solar eruptions is found to be systematically higher for active years
between 2003-2012 than for those between 1997-2002. This appears to be connected with the weakness
of the late-cycle 23 polar fields as suggested by Luhmann. We see evidence that the process of cycle
24 field reversal is well advanced at both poles.
