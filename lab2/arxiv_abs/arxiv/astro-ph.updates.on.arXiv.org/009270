In $N$-body systems with long-range interactions mean-field effects dominate over binary interactions
(collisions), so that relaxation to thermal equilibrium occurs on time scales that grow with $N$,
diverging in the $N\to\infty$ limit. However, a faster and non-collisional relaxation process,
referred to as violent relaxation, sets in when starting from generic initial conditions: collective
oscillations (referred to as virial oscillations) develop and damp out on timescales not depending
on the system's size. After the damping of such oscillations the system is found in a quasi-stationary
state that survives virtually forever when the system is very large. During violent relaxation
the distribution function obeys the collisionless Boltzmann (or Vlasov) equation, that, being
invariant under time reversal, does not "naturally" describe a relaxation process. Indeed, the
dynamics is moved to smaller and smaller scales in phase space as time goes on, so that observables
that do not depend on small-scale details appear as relaxed after a short time. We propose an approximation
scheme to describe collisionless relaxation, based on the introduction of moments of the distribution
function, and apply it to the Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) model. To the leading order, virial oscillations
are equivalent to the motion of a particle in a one-dimensional potential. Inserting higher-order
contributions in an effective way, inspired by the Caldeira-Leggett model of quantum dissipation,
we derive a dissipative equation describing the damping of the oscillations, including a renormalization
of the effective potential and yielding predictions for collective properties of the system after
the damping in very good agreement with numerical simulations. Here we restrict ourselves to "cold"
initial conditions; generic initial conditions will be considered in a forthcoming paper.
