Circumbinary disks are common around post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars with a stellar
companion on orbital time scales of a few 100 to few 1000 days. The presence of a disk is usually inferred
from the system's spectral energy distribution (SED), and confirmed, for a sub-sample, by interferometric
observations. We used the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE) instrument
on the Very Large Telescope to obtain extreme adaptive optics assisted scattered light images of
the post-AGB binary system AR Puppis. Data have been obtained in the V, I, and H bands. Our observations
have produced the first resolved images of AR Puppis' circumbinary disk and confirm its edge-on
orientation. In our high angular-resolution and high dynamic-range images we identify several
structural components such as a dark mid-plane, the disk surface, and arc-like features. We discuss
the nature of these components and use complementary photometric monitoring to relate them to the
orbital phase of the binary system. Because the star is completely obscured by the disk at visible
wavelengths, we conclude that the long-term photometric variability of the system must be caused
by variable scattering, not extinction, of star light by the disk over the binary orbit. Finally,
we discuss how the short disk life times and fast evolution of the host stars compared to the ages at
which protoplanetary disks are typically observed make systems like AR Puppis valuable extreme
laboratories to study circumstellar disk evolution and constrain the time scale of dust grain growth
during the planet formation process.
