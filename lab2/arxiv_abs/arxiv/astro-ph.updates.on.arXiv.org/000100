Based on observational tests and constraints on halo structure, dark matter is generally taken
to be cold and essentially collisionless. On the other hand, given the large number of particles
and forces in the visible world, a more complex dark sector could be a reasonable or even likely possibility.
This hypothesis leads to testable consequences, perhaps portending the discovery of a rich hidden
world neighboring our own. We consider a scenario that readily satisfies current bounds that we
call Partially Interacting Dark Matter (PIDM). This scenario contains self-interacting dark
matter, but it is not the dominant component. Even if PIDM contains only a fraction of the net dark
matter density, comparable to the baryonic fraction, the subdominant component's interactions
can lead to interesting and potentially observable consequences. Our primary focus will be the
special case of Double-Disk Dark Matter (DDDM), in which self-interactions allow the dark matter
to lose enough energy to lead to dynamics similar to those in the baryonic sector. We explore a simple
model in which DDDM can cool efficiently and form a disk within galaxies, and we evaluate some of the
possible observational signatures. The most prominent signal of such a scenario could be an enhanced
indirect detection signature with a distinctive spatial distribution. Even though subdominant,
the enhanced density at the center of the galaxy and possibly throughout the plane of the galaxy can
lead to large boost factors, and could even explain a signature as large as the 130 GeV Fermi line.
Such scenarios also predict additional dark radiation degrees of freedom that could soon be detectable
and would influence the interpretation of future data, such as that from Planck and from the Gaia
satellite. We consider this to be the first step toward exploring a rich array of new possibilities
for dark matter dynamics.
