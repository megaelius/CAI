The classification of the host galaxies of the radio sources in the 25 deg$^2$ ultimate XMM extragalactic
survey south field (XXL-S) is presented. XXL-S was surveyed at 2.1 GHz with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA) and is thus far the largest area radio survey conducted down to rms flux densities
of $\sigma \sim 41$ $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Of the 6287 radio sources in XXL-S, 4758 (75.7%) were cross-matched
to an optical counterpart using the likelihood ratio technique. There are 1110 spectroscopic redshifts
and 3648 photometric redshifts available for the counterparts, of which 99.4% exist out to $z \sim
4$. A number of multiwavelength diagnostics, including X-ray luminosities, mid-infrared colours,
spectral energy distribution fits, radio luminosities, and optical emission lines and colours,
were used to classify the sources into three types: low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs), high-excitation
radio galaxies (HERGs), and star-forming galaxies (SFGs). The final sample contains 1729 LERGs
(36.3%), 1159 radio-loud HERGs (24.4%), 296 radio-quiet HERGs (6.2%), 558 SFGs (11.7%), and 1016
unclassified sources (21.4%). The LERGs tend to exist in the most massive galaxies with low star
formation rates and redder colours, whereas the HERGs and SFGs exist in galaxies of lower mass, higher
star formation rates, and bluer colours. The fraction of blue host galaxies is higher for radio-quiet
HERGs than for radio-loud HERGs. LERGs and radio-loud HERGs are found at all radio luminosities,
but radio-loud HERGs tend to be more radio luminous than LERGs at a given redshift. These results
are consistent with the emerging picture in which LERGs exist in the most massive quiescent galaxies
typically found in clusters with hot X-ray halos and HERGs are associated with ongoing star formation
in their host galaxies via the accretion of cold gas.
