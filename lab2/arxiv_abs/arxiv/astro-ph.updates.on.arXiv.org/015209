The atmospheres of temperate planets may be regulated by geochemical cycles. Silicate weathering
provides essential negative feedback to the carbonate-silicate cycle (carbon cycle) to maintain
temperate climates on Earth and possibly on Earth-sized temperate exoplanets. The intensity of
weathering is normally attributed to the kinetics of weathering reactions of individual minerals.
The implementation of a transport-controlled weathering model shows that when the CO$_2$ volume
mixing ratio decreases or surface temperature increases, equilibrium thermodynamics rather
than kinetics exerts a strong control on weathering. Modeling the weathering of all minerals in
a given rock instead of individual minerals is crucial. The transition between kinetically- and
thermodynamically-limited regimes of weathering is strongly sensitive to rock lithology. Application
of this model to Earth suggests that global mean continental granite and seafloor basalt weathering
rates are likely limited by the supply of fresh rocks, yet regional weathering rates can be influenced
by both kinetics and thermodynamics. Consideration of total dissolved inorganic carbon as a proxy
for weathering results in another CO$_2$ drawdown regime: CO$_2$ dissolution, where aqueous bicarbonate
and carbonate ions produced by rock weathering are lower in concentration than aqueous CO$_2$.
Upper limits to weathering as a function of lithology are provided to calculate the maximum impact
of weathering on the carbon cycle. The temperature-sensitivity of the thermodynamically-limited
silicate weathering provides a potential positive feedback to the carbon cycle which may shift
the inner edge of the habitable zone.
