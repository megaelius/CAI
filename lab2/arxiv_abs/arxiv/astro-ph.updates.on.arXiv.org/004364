Fundamental atomic parameters, such as oscillator strengths, play a key role in modelling and understanding
the chemical composition of stars in the universe. Despite the significant work underway to produce
these parameters for many astrophysically important ions, uncertainties in these parameters
remain large and can propagate throughout the entire field of astronomy. The Belgian repository
of fundamental atomic data and stellar spectra (BRASS) aims to provide the largest systematic and
homogeneous quality assessment of atomic data to date in terms of wavelength, atomic and stellar
parameter coverage. To prepare for it, we first compiled multiple literature occurrences of many
individual atomic transitions, from several atomic databases of astrophysical interest, and
assessed their agreement. Several atomic repositories were searched and their data retrieved
and formatted in a consistent manner. Data entries from all repositories were cross-matched against
our initial BRASS atomic line list to find multiple occurrences of the same transition. Where possible
we used a non-parametric cross-match depending only on electronic configurations and total angular
momentum values. We also checked for duplicate entries of the same physical transition, within
each retrieved repository, using the non-parametric cross-match. We report the cross-matched
transitions for each repository and compare their fundamental atomic parameters. We find differences
in log(gf) values of up to 2 dex or more. We also find and report that ~2% of our line list and Vienna Atomic
Line Database retrievals are composed of duplicate transitions. Finally we provide a number of
examples of atomic spectral lines with different log(gf) values, and discuss the impact of these
uncertain log(gf) values on quantitative spectroscopy. All cross-matched atomic data and duplicate
transitions are available to download at brass.sdf.org.
