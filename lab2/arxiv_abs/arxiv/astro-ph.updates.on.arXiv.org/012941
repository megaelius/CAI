Planetary systems formed in clusters may be subject to stellar encounter flybys. Here we create
a diverse range of representative planetary systems with different orbital scales and planets'
masses and examine encounters between them in a typical open cluster. We first explore the close-in
multi-super earth systems $\lesssim0.1$ au. They are resistant to flybys in that only ones inside
a few au can destabilise a planet or break the resonance between such planets. But these systems may
capture giant planets onto wide orbits from the intruding star during distant flybys. If so, the
original close-in small planets' orbits may be tilted together through Kozai--Lidov mechanism,
forming a "cold" system that is significantly inclined against the equator of the central host.
Moving to the intermediately-placed planets around solar-like stars, we find that the planets'
mass gradient governs the systems' long-term evolution post-encounter: more massive planets
have better chances to survive. Also, a system's angular momentum deficit, a quantity describing
how eccentric/inclined the orbits are, measured immediately after the encounter, closely relates
to the longevity of the systems -- whether or not and when the systems turn unstable in the ensuing
evolution millions of years post-encounter. We compare the orbits of the surviving planets in the
unstable systems through (1) the immediate consequence of the stellar fly or (2) internal interplanetary
scattering long post-encounter and find that those for the former are systematically colder. Finally,
we show that massive wide-orbit multi-planet systems like that of HR 8799 can be easily disrupted
and encounters at a few hundreds of au suffice.
