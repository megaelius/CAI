Stellar populations are powerful tools for investigating the evolution of extragalactic environments.
We present the first UV integrated-light spectroscopic observations for 15 young star clusters
in the starburst M83 with a special focus on metallicity measurements. The data were obtained with
the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. We analyse the data applying
an abundance technique previously used to study an optical set of star clusters. We estimate a central
metallicity of [Z] = $+$0.20 $\pm$ 0.15 dex in agreement with those obtained through independent
methods, i.e. $J$-band and blue supergiants. We estimate a UV metallicity gradient of $-$0.041
$\pm$ 0.022 dex kpc$^{-1}$ consistent with the optical metallicity gradient of $-$0.040 $\pm$
0.032 dex kpc$^{-1}$ for $R/R_{25}<0.5$. Combining our stellar metallicities, UV and optical,
with those from HII regions (strong-line abundances based on empirical calibrations) we identify
two possible breaks in the gradient of M83 at galactocentric distances of $R\sim0.5$ and $1.0\:R_{25}$.
If the abundance breaks are genuine, the metallicity gradient of this galaxy follows a steep-shallow-steep
trend, a scenario predicted by three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations of disc galaxies.
The first break is located near the corotation radius. This first steep gradient may have originated
by recent star formation episodes and a relatively young bar ($<$1 Gyr). In the numerical simulations
the shallow gradient is created by the effects of dilution by outflow where low-metallicity material
is mixed with enriched gas. And finally, the second break and last steep gradient mark the farthest
galactocentric distances where the outward flow has penetrated.
