(Abridged) We aim at linking the dynamical and radiative properties of the remnant of SN 1987A to
the geometrical and physical characteristics of the parent aspherical SN explosion and to the internal
structure of its progenitor star. We performed 3D hydrodynamic simulations which describe the
long-term evolution of SN 1987A from the onset of the SN to the full-fledged remnant at the age of 50
years, accounting for the pre-SN structure of the progenitor star. The simulations include all
physical processes relevant for the complex phases of SN evolution and for the interaction of the
SNR with the highly inhomogeneous ambient environment around SN 1987A. From the simulations, we
synthesize observables to be compared with observations. By comparing the model results with observations,
we constrained the initial SN anisotropy causing Doppler shifts observed in emission lines of heavy
elements from ejecta, and leading to the remnant evolution observed in the X-ray band in the last
30 years. In particular, we found that the high mixing of ejecta unveiled by high redshifts and broadenings
of [FeII] and $^{44}$Ti lines require a highly asymmetric SN explosion channeling a significant
fraction of energy along an axis almost lying in the plane of the central equatorial ring around SN
1987A, roughly along the line-of-sight but with an offset of 40 deg, with the lobe propagating away
from the observer slightly more energetic than the other. We found unambiguously that the observed
distribution of ejecta and the dynamical and radiative properties of the SNR can be best reproduced
if the structure of the progenitor star was that of a blue supergiant resulted from the merging of
two massive stars.
