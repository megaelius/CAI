Context. The youngest Galactic supernova remnant G1.9+0.3 is an interesting target for next generation
gamma-ray observatories. So far, the remnant is only detected in the radio and the X-ray bands, but
its young age of ~100 yrs and inferred shock speed of ~14,000 km/s could make it an efficient particle
accelerator. Aims. We aim to model the observed radio and X-ray spectra together with the morphology
of the remnant. At the same time, we aim to estimate the gamma-ray flux from the source and evaluated
the prospects of its detection with future gamma-ray experiments. Methods. We performed spherical
symmetric 1-D simulations with the RATPaC code, in which we simultaneously solve the transport
equation for cosmic rays, the transport equation for magnetic turbulence, and the hydro-dynamical
equations for the gas flow. Separately computed distributions of the particles accelerated at
the forward and the reverse shock are then used to calculate the spectra of synchrotron, inverse
Compton, and pion-decay radiation from the source. Results. The emission from G1.9+0.3 can be self-consistently
explained within the test-particle limit. We find that the X-ray flux is dominated by emission from
the forward shock while most of the radio emission originates near the reverse shock, which makes
G1.9+0.3 the first remnant with non-thermal radiation detected from the reverse shock. The flux
of very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from G1.9+0.3 is expected to be close to the sensitivity
threshold of the Cherenkov Telescope Array, CTA. The limited time available to grow large-scale
turbulence limits the maximum energy of particles to values below 100 TeV, hence G1.9+0.3 is not
a PeVatron.
