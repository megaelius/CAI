We present the physical extent of [CII] 158um line-emitting gas from 46 star-forming galaxies at
z=4-6 from the ALMA Large Program to INvestigate CII at Early Times (ALPINE). Using exponential
profile fits, we measure the effective radius of the [CII] line (r_e,[CII]) for individual galaxies
and compare them with the rest-frame ultra-violet (UV) continuum (r_e,UV) from Hubble Space Telescope
images. The effective radius r_e,[CII] almost always exceeds r_e,UV by factors of ~2-3 and the ratio
of r_e,[CII]/r_e,UV increases as a function of M_star. We do not find strong evidence for a displacement
over ~ 1-kpc scale among the [CII] line, the rest-frame UV, and FIR continuum. We identify 30% of isolated
ALPINE sources as having an extended [CII] component over 10-kpc scales detected at 4.1$\sigma$-10.9$\sigma$
beyond the size of rest-frame UV and far-infrared (FIR) continuum. One object has tentative rotating
features up to ~10-kpc, where the 3D model fit shows the rotating [CII]-gas disk spread over 4 times
larger than the rest-frame UV-emitting region. Galaxies with the extended [CII] line structure
have high star-formation rate (SFR), stellar mass (M_star), low Lya equivalent-width, and more
blue-shifted (red-shifted) rest-frame UV metal absorption (Lya line), as compared to galaxies
without such extended [CII] structures. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that a selection
bias towards luminous objects may be responsible for such trends, the extended [CII] line structure
appears even around several objects whose SFR and M_star are as small as those without the extended
structure. Deeper observations are essential to test whether the extended [CII] line structures
are ubiquitous to high-z star-forming galaxies.
