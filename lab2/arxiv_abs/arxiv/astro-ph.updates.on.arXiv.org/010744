With the opening of the X and gamma--ray windows in the sixties, thanks to to sounding rockets and
satellite-borne instruments, extremely energetic and violent phenomena were discovered and
subsequently found to be ubiquitous in the Universe. Observations in the high energy domain are
fundamental for understanding how matter is organized and behaves around black holes; unravelling
how these extreme objects influence their environments on a very large scale; and finding the still
elusive obscured massive objects in the centre of galaxies. Other major problems in contemporary
astrophysics, such as the understanding of acceleration processes at shocks of all sizes (those
of pulsar wind nebulae, supernova remnants, but also at larger scales those of Active Galactic Nuclei
radio lobes) in relation to the origin of cosmic-rays, or the definitive characterization of the
debated non-thermal X-ray energy content of clusters of galaxies, also requires observations
at very high energies. An observatory type medium mission operating from around 1 keV to about 600
keV can provide direct insights into these major questions. The essential characteristics will
be coverage of the full energy range by telescopes featuring a large throughput and arc-second resolution
optics, coupled to a compact focal plane assembly, with excellent imaging resolution and spectroscopy.
In addition, the mission will provide unique polarimetry measurements in the hard X-ray domain,
an important new diagnostic tool at energies for which the non-thermal processes dominate. The
Polarimetric High-Energy Modular Telescope Observatory (PHEMTO) is designed to have performance
several orders of magnitude better than the present hard X-ray instruments. This gives to PHEMTO
the improvements in scientific performance needed for a mission in the 2050 era.
