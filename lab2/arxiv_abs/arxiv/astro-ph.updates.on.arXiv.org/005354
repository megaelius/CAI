Recent studies have analyzed the dynamical evolution of outer small body populations under the
effects of an eccentric inner massive perturber. Such outer reservoirs are composed of particles
on prograde and retrograde orbits, as well as particles whose orbit flips from prograde to retrograde
and back again showing a coupling between the inclination i and the ascending node longitude \Omega
(Type-F particles). We analyze the role of the General Relativity (GR) on the dynamics of outer particles
under the influence of an inner eccentric Jupiter-mass planet produced by a planetary scattering
event. In particular, we study how the GR affects the dynamical evolution of the outer Type-F particles,
which experience an eccentric Lidov-Kozai mechanism. We carry out N-body simulations with and
without GR effects. When the GR is included, the extreme values of \Omega are obtained for retrograde
inclinations, while the minimum and maximum inclinations allowed for Type-F particles increase
in comparison with that derived without GR effects. According to this, if the GR is included in the
simulations, the range of prograde (retrograde) inclinations of the libration region is reduced
(increased) respect to that obtained in absence of GR. We find two new class of particles when the
GR effects are included in the simulations. On the one hand, particles whose orbital plane flips
from prograde to retrograde and back again without experiencing a coupling between i and \Omega.
On the other hand, retrograde particles that show a strong coupling between i and \Omega. We infer
that the GR may significantly modify the dynamical properties of the outer reservoirs that evolve
under the effects of an eccentric inner perturber.
