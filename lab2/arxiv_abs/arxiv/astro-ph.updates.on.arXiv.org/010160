We present the strongest constraints to date on anisotropies of cosmic microwave background (CMB)
polarization rotation derived from 150 GHz data taken by the BICEP2/Keck Array CMB experiments
up to and including the 2014 observing season (BK14). The definition of the polarization angle in
BK14 maps has gone through self-calibration in which the overall angle is adjusted to minimize the
observed TB and EB power spectra. After this procedure, the QU maps lose sensitivity to a uniform
polarization rotation but are still sensitive to anisotropies of polarization rotation. This
analysis places constraints on the anisotropies of polarization rotation, which could be generated
by CMB photons interacting with axionlike pseudoscalar fields or Faraday rotation induced by primordial
magnetic fields. The sensitivity of BK14 maps ($\sim 3\mu$K-arcmin) makes it possible to reconstruct
anisotropies of the polarization rotation angle and measure their angular power spectrum much
more precisely than previous attempts. Our data are found to be consistent with no polarization
rotation anisotropies, improving the upper bound on the amplitude of the rotation angle spectrum
by roughly an order of magnitude compared to the previous best constraints. Our results lead to an
order of magnitude better constraint on the coupling constant of the Chern-Simons electromagnetic
term $g_{a\gamma}\leq 7.2\times 10^{-2}/H_I$ (95% confidence) than the constraint derived from
the B-mode spectrum, where $H_I$ is the inflationary Hubble scale. This constraint leads to a limit
on the decay constant of $10^{-6}\lesssim f_a/M_{\rm pl}$ at mass range of $10^{-33}< m_a< 10^{-28}$
eV for $r=0.01$, assuming $g_{a\gamma}\sim\alpha/(2\pi f_a)$ with $\alpha$ denoting the fine
structure constant. The upper bound on the amplitude of the primordial magnetic fields is 30nG (95%
confidence) from the polarization rotation anisotropies.
