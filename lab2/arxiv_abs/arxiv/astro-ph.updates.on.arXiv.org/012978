Global magnetic fields of active solar-like stars are nowadays routinely detected with spectropolarimetric
measurements and are mapped with Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI). However, due to the cancellation
of opposite field polarities, polarimetry captures only a tiny fraction of the magnetic flux and
cannot assess the overall stellar surface magnetic field if it is dominated by a small-scale component.
Analysis of Zeeman broadening in high-resolution intensity spectra can reveal these hidden complex
magnetic fields. Historically, there were very few attempts to obtain such measurements for G dwarf
stars due to the difficulty of disentangling Zeeman effect from other broadening mechanisms affecting
spectral lines. Here we developed a new magnetic field diagnostic method based on relative Zeeman
intensification of optical atomic lines with different magnetic sensitivity. Using this technique
we obtained 78 field strength measurements for 15 Sun-like stars, including some of the best-studied
young solar twins. We find that the average magnetic field strength $Bf$ drops from 1.3-2.0 kG in
stars younger than about 120 Myr to 0.2-0.8 kG in older stars. The mean field strength shows a clear
correlation with the Rossby number and with the coronal and chromospheric emission indicators.
Our results suggest that magnetic regions have roughly the same local field strength $B\approx3.2$
kG in all stars, with the filling factor $f$ of these regions systematically increasing with stellar
activity. Comparing our results with the spectropolarimetric analyses of global magnetic fields
in the same stars, we find that ZDI recovers about 1% of the total magnetic field energy in the most
active stars. This figure drops to just 0.01% for the least active targets.
