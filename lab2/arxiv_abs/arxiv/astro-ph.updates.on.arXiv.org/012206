Recent studies have shown how the distribution of $^{56}$Ni within the ejecta of type Ia supernovae
can have profound consequences on the observed light curves. Observations at early times can therefore
provide important details on the explosion physics in thermonuclear supernovae. We present a series
of radiative transfer calculations that explore variations in the $^{56}$Ni distribution. Our
models also show the importance of the density profile in shaping the light curve, which is often
neglected in the literature. Using our model set, we investigate the observations that are necessary
to determine the $^{56}$Ni distribution as robustly as possible within the current model set. We
find that this includes observations beginning at least $\sim$14 days before $B$-band maximum,
extending to approximately maximum light with a high ($\lesssim$3 day) cadence, and in at least
one blue and one red band are required (such as $B$ and $R$, or $g$ and $r$). We compare a number of well-observed
type Ia supernovae that meet these criteria to our models and find that the light curves of $\sim$70-80\%
of objects in our sample are consistent with being produced solely by variations in the $^{56}$Ni
distributions. The remaining supernovae show an excess of flux at early times, indicating missing
physics that is not accounted for within our model set, such as an interaction or the presence of short-lived
radioactive isotopes. Comparing our model light curves and spectra to observations and delayed
detonation models demonstrates that while a somewhat extended $^{56}$Ni distribution is necessary
to reproduce the observed light curve shape, this does not negatively affect the spectra at maximum
light. Investigating current explosion models shows that observations typically require a shallower
decrease in the $^{56}$Ni mass towards the outer ejecta than is produced for models of a given $^{56}$Ni
mass.
