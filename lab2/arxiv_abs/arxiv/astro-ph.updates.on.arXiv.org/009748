Current observational data of exoplanets are providing increasing detail of their 3D atmospheric
structures. As characterisation efforts expand in scope, the need to develop consistent 3D radiative-transfer
methods becomes more pertinent as the complex atmospheric properties of exoplanets are required
to be modelled together consistently. We aim to compare the transmission and emission spectra results
of a 3D Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer (MCRT) model to contemporary radiative-transfer suites.
We perform several benchmarking tests of a MCRT code, Cloudy Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer (CMCRT),
to transmission and emission spectra model output. We add flexibility to the model through the use
of k-distribution tables as input opacities. We present a hybrid MCRT and ray tracing methodology
for the calculation of transmission spectra with a multiple scattering component. CMCRT compares
well to the transmission spectra benchmarks at the 10s of ppm level. Emission spectra benchmarks
are consistent to within 10% of the 1D models. We suggest that differences in the benchmark results
are likely caused by geometric effects between plane-parallel and spherical models. In a practical
application, we post-process a cloudy 3DHD 189733b GCM model and compare to available observational
data. Our results suggest the core methodology and algorithms of CMCRT produce consistent results
to contemporary radiative transfer suites. 3D MCRT methods are highly suitable for detailed post-processing
of cloudy and non-cloudy 1D and 3D exoplanet atmosphere simulations in instances where atmospheric
inhomogeneities, significant limb effects/geometry or multiple scattering components are important
considerations.
