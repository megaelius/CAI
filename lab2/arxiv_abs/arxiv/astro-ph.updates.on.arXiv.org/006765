State-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have star particles with typical
mass between $\sim 10^8$ and $\sim 10^3$ M$_{\odot}$ according to resolution, and treat them as
simple stellar populations. On the other hand, observations in nearby galaxies resolve individual
stars and provide us with single star properties. An accurate and fair comparison between predictions
from simulations and observations is a crucial task. We introduce a novel approach to consistently
populate star particles with stars. We developed a technique to generate a theoretical catalogue
of mock stars whose characteristics are derived from the properties of parent star particles from
a cosmological simulation. Also, a library of stellar evolutionary tracks and synthetic spectra
is used to mimic the photometric properties of mock stars. The aim of this tool is to produce a database
of synthetic stars from the properties of parent star particles in simulations: such a database
represents the observable stellar content of simulated galaxies and allows a comparison as accurate
as possible with observations of resolved stellar populations. With this innovative approach
we are able to provide a colour-magnitude diagram from a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation.
This method is flexible and can be tailored to fit output of different codes used for cosmological
simulations. Also, it is of paramount importance with ongoing survey data releases (e.g. GAIA and
surveys of resolved stellar populations), and will be useful to predict properties of stars with
peculiar chemical features and to compare predictions from hydrodynamical models with data of
different tracers of stellar populations.
