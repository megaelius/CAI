Increasing the statistics of evolved massive stars in the Local Group enables investigating their
evolution at different metallicities. During the late stages of stellar evolution, the physics
of some phenomena, such as episodic and systematic mass loss, are not well constrained. For example,
the physical properties of red supergiants (RSGs) in different metallicity regimes remain poorly
understood. Thus, we initiated a systematic study of RSGs in dwarf irregular galaxies (dIrrs) in
the Local Group. The target selection is based on 3.6 $\mu$m and 4.5 $\mu$m photometry from archival
Spitzer Space Telescope images of nearby galaxies. We selected 46 targets in the dIrrs IC 10, IC 1613,
Sextans B, and the Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM) galaxy that we observed with the GTC-OSIRIS and
VLT-FORS2 instruments. We used several photometric techniques together with a spectral energy
distribution analysis to derive the luminosities and effective temperatures of known and newly
discovered RSGs. We identified and spectroscopically confirmed 4 new RSGs, 5 previously known
RSGs, and 5 massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We added known objects from previous observations.
In total, we present spectral classification and fundamental physical parameters of 25 late-type
massive stars in the following dIrrs: Sextans A, Sextans B, IC 10, IC 1613, Pegasus, Phoenix, and
WLM. This includes 17 RSGs and 8 AGB stars that have been identified here and previously. Based on
our observational results and PARSEC evolutionary models, we draw the following conclusions:
(i) a trend to higher minimum effective temperatures at lower metallicities and (ii) the maximum
luminosity of RSGs appears to be constant at $log$($L/L$$_{\odot}$) $\approx$ $5.5$, independent
of the metallicity of the host environment (up to $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$ $\approx$ $-1$ dex).
