We report on two NuSTAR observations of the HMXB A 0535+26 taken toward the end of its normal 2015 outburst
at very low $3-50$ keV luminosities of ${\sim}1.4\times10^{36}$ erg/s and ${\sim}5\times10^{35}$
erg/s which are complemented by 9 Swift observations. The data clearly confirm indications seen
in earlier data that the source's spectral shape softens as it becomes fainter. The smooth, exponential
rollover at high energies present in the first observation evolves to a much more abrupt steepening
of the spectrum at $20-30$ keV. The continuum evolution can be well described with emission from
a magnetized accretion column, modeled using the compmag model modified by an additional Gaussian
emission component for the fainter observation. Between the two observations, the optical depth
changes from $0.75\pm0.04$ to $0.56^{+0.01}_{-0.04}$, the electron temperature remains constant,
and there is an indication that the column decreases in radius. Since the energy resolved pulse profiles
remain virtually unchanged in shape between the two observations, the emission properties of the
accretion column, however, reflect the same accretion regime. This conclusion is also confirmed
by our result that the energy of the cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF) at ${\sim}45$
keV is independent of the luminosity, implying that the magnetic field in the region in which the
observed radiation is produced is the same in both observations. Finally, we also constrain the
evolution of the continuum parameters with rotational phase of the neutron star. The width of the
CRSF could only be constrained for the brighter observation. Based on Monte-Carlo simulations
of CRSF formation in single accretion columns, its pulse phase dependence supports a simplified
fan beam emission pattern. The evolution of the CRSF width is very similar to that of the CRSF depth,
which is in disagreement with expectations.
