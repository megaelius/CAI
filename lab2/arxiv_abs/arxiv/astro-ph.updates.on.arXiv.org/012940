We study the atomic gas content and the central stellar mass concentration for a sample of almost
1500 nearby galaxies to investigate the nature of starbursts and the influence of galaxy-galaxy
interactions on star formation. We use the catalogue on interacting and merging galaxies in the
S$^4$G survey of Knapen et al. (2014) along with archival HI gas masses, stellar masses ($M_{\ast}$),
and SFRs (from IRAS far-IR fluxes), and calculate depletion times ($\tau$) and gas fractions. We
trace the central stellar mass concentration from the inner slope of the stellar component of the
rotation curves, $d_{\rm R}v_{\ast}(0)$. Starbursts - defined as galaxies with a factor $>4$ enhanced
SFR relative to a control sample ($\pm 0.2$ dex in stellar mass, $\pm 1$ in $T$-type, non-interacting)
- are mainly early-type ($T\lesssim 5$) massive spiral galaxies ($M_{\ast}\gtrsim 10^{10}M_{\odot}$),
not necessarily interacting. For a given stellar mass bin, starbursts are characterised by lower
gas depletion times, similar gas fractions, and larger central stellar mass concentrations than
non-starburst galaxies. The global distributions of gas fraction and gas depletion time are not
statistically different for interacting and non-interacting galaxies. However, in the case of
currently merging galaxies, the median gas depletion time is a factor of $0.4 \pm 0.2$ that of control
sample galaxies, and their star formation rates are a factor of $1.9 \pm 0.5$ enhanced, even though
the median gas fraction is similar. Starbursts present long-lasting star formation in the circumnuclear
regions that causes an enhancement of the central stellar density at $z\approx0$ in both interacting
and non-interacting systems. Starbursts have low gas depletion timescales, yet similar gas fractions
as normal main-sequence galaxies. Galaxy mergers cause a moderate enhancement of the star formation
efficiency (Abridged).
