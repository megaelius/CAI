In a strongly stratified turbulent layer, a uniform horizontal magnetic field can become unstable
to form spontaneously local flux concentrations due to a negative contribution of turbulence to
the large-scale (mean-field) magnetic pressure. This mechanism is of interest in connection with
dynamo scenarios in which most of the magnetic field resides in the bulk of the convection zone, and
not at the bottom, as is usually assumed. Recent work using the mean-field hydromagnetic equations
has shown that this negative effective magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI) becomes suppressed
at rather low rotation rates with Coriolis numbers as low as 0.1. Here we extend these earlier investigations
by studying the effects of rotation both on the development of NEMPI and on the effective magnetic
pressure (turbulent and non-turbulent contributions). We quantify the kinetic helicity resulting
from rotation and stratification and compare with earlier work at smaller scale-separation ratios.
We also determine the sensitivity of surface diagnostics of magnetic helicity. We use direct numerical
simulations (DNS) and mean-field calculations of the three-dimensional hydromagnetic equations
in a Cartesian domain and analytical studies using the $\tau$ approach. We find that the growth rates
of NEMPI in earlier mean-field calculations are well reproduced with DNS and that the rotational
effect on the effective magnetic pressure is negligible as long as the production of flux concentrations
is not inhibited by rotation. In that case, kinetic and magnetic helicity are also found to be weak.
Production of magnetic flux concentrations through the suppression of turbulent pressure appears
to be possible only in the upper-most layers of the Sun, where the convective turnover time is less
than 2 hours.
