We present far-IR/sub-mm imaging and spectroscopy of 49 Ceti, an unusual circumstellar disk around
a nearby young A1V star. The system is famous for showing the dust properties of a debris disk, but
the gas properties of a low-mass protoplanetary disk. The data were acquired with the Herschel Space
Observatory PACS and SPIRE instruments, largely as part of the "Gas in Protoplanetary Systems"
(GASPS) Open Time Key Programme. Disk dust emission is detected in images at 70, 160, 250, 350, and
500 \mu m; 49 Cet is significantly extended in the 70 \mu m image, spatially resolving the outer dust
disk for the first time. Spectra covering small wavelength ranges centered on eight atomic and molecular
emission lines were obtained, including [OI] 63 \mu m and [CII] 158 \mu m. The CII line was detected
at the 5\sigma\ level - the first detection of atomic emission from the disk. No other emission lines
were seen, despite the fact that the OI line is the brightest one observed in Herschel protoplanetary
disk spectra (Meeus et al. 2012; Dent et al. 2013). We present an estimate of the amount of circumstellar
atomic gas implied by the CII emission. The new far-IR/sub-mm data fills in a large gap in the previous
spectral energy distribution (SED) of 49 Cet. A simple model of the new SED confirms the two-component
structure of the disk: warm inner dust and cold outer dust that produces most of the observed excess.
Finally, we discuss preliminary thermochemical modeling of the 49 Cet gas/dust disk and our attempts
to match several observational results simultaneously. Although we are not yet successful in doing
so, our investigations shed light on the evolutionary status of the 49 Cet gas, which might not be
primordial gas but rather secondary gas coming from comets.
