Dwarf carbon (dC) stars, main sequence stars showing carbon molecular bands, were initially thought
to be a mystery class since only AGB stars are sufficiently evolved enough to have dredged carbon
into their atmospheres. However, a few types of giants are known to show anomalous abundances ---
notably, the CH and Ba stars and, more recently, the CEMP-s stars --- and were also found to have a high
binary frequency. This discovery led to suspicions that these systems were all in post mass transfer
binary systems, where a former AGB companion has since faded to a white dwarf. The dC stars may be the
enhanced-abundance progenitors of most, if not all, of these systems, but this mechanism requires
the existence of a high binary frequency for dCs. Here, we examine a large sample of dC stars targeted
for repeat spectroscopy by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey to constrain
the binary frequency and orbital properties. We analyze radial velocity variability between spectral
epochs for a sample of 240 dC stars with a total of 540 spectra. A handful of dC systems show large velocity
shifts (> 100 km s$^{-1}$) between repeat spectra. We compare the dCs to a control sample with a similar
distribution of magnitude, color, proper motion, and parallax. Using MCMC methods, we use the measured
$\Delta$RV distribution to estimate the separation distribution assuming both a unimodal and
bimodal distribution. These models result in mean separations of less than 1 AU, corresponding
to periods on the order of 1 year for varying dC masses. These results support the conclusion that
dC stars form from close binary systems via mass transfer.
