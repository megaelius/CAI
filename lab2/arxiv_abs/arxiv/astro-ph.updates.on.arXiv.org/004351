The AKARI IRC All-sky survey provided more than twenty thousand thermal infrared observations
of over five thousand asteroids. Diameters and albedos were obtained by fitting an empirically
calibrated version of the standard thermal model to these data. After the publication of the flux
catalogue in October 2016, our aim here is to present the AKARI IRC all-sky survey data and discuss
valuable scientific applications in the field of small-body physical properties studies. As an
example, we update the catalogue of asteroid diameters and albedos based on AKARI using the near-Earth
asteroid thermal model (NEATM). We fit the NEATM to derive asteroid diameters and, whenever possible,
infrared beaming parameters. We obtained a total of 8097 diameters and albedos for 5170 asteroids,
and we fitted the beaming parameter for almost two thousand of them. When it was not possible to fit
the beaming parameter, we used a straight line fit to our sample's beaming parameter-versus-phase
angle plot to set the default value for each fit individually instead of using a single average value.
Our diameters agree with stellar-occultation-based diameters well within the accuracy expected
for the model. They also match the previous AKARI-based catalogue at phase angles lower than 50 degrees,
but we find a systematic deviation at higher phase angles, at which near-Earth and Mars-crossing
asteroids were observed. The AKARI IRC All-sky survey provides observations at different observation
geometries, rotational coverages and aspect angles. For example, by comparing in more detail a
few asteroids for which dimensions were derived from occultations, we discuss how the multiple
observations per object may already provide three-dimensional information about elongated objects
even based on an idealised model like the NEATM.
