Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect is one of the recent probes of cosmology and large scale structures.
We update constraints on cosmological parameters from galaxy clusters observed by the Planck satellite
in a first attempt to combine cluster number counts and power spectrum of hot gas, using the new value
of the optical depth, and sampling at the same time on cosmological and scaling-relation parameters.
We find that in the $\Lambda$CDM model, the addition of tSZ power spectrum provides only small improvements
with respect to number counts only, leading to the $68\%$ c.l. constraints $\Omega _m = 0.32 \pm 0.02$,
$\sigma _8 = 0.77\pm0.03 $ and $\sigma _8 (\Omega _m/0.3)^{1/3}= 0.78\pm0.03$ and lowering the
discrepancy with CMB primary anisotropies results (updated with the new value of $\tau$) to $\simeq
1.6\, \sigma$ on $\sigma _8$. We analyse extensions to standard model, considering the effect of
massive neutrinos and varying the equation of state parameter for dark energy. In the first case,
we find that the addition of tSZ power spectrum helps in strongly improving cosmological constraints
with respect to number counts only results, leading to the $95\%$ upper limit $\sum m_{\nu}< 1.53
\, \text{eV}$. For the varying dark energy EoS scenario, we find again no important improvements
when adding tSZ power spectrum, but still the combination of tSZ probes is able in providing constraints,
producing $w = -1.0\pm 0.2$. In all cosmological scenari the mass bias to reconcile CMB and tSZ probes
remains low: $(1-b)\lesssim 0.66$ as compared to estimates from weak lensing and Xray mass estimate
comparisons or numerical simulations.
