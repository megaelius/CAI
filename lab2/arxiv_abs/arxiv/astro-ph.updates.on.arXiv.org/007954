One of the main physical mechanisms that could drive mass outflows in AGNs is radiation pressure
on spectral lines. Although this mechanism is conceptually straightforward to understand, the
actual magnitude of the radiation force is challenging to compute because the force depends on the
physical conditions in the gas, as well as the strength, spectral energy distribution (SED), and
geometry of the radiation field. We present results from our photoionization and radiation transfer
calculations of the so-called force multiplier, $M$, using the same radiation field to compute
the gas photoionization and thermal balance. Our method is general and can be used for an arbitrary
SED. Here we focus on describing results for two SEDs that correspond to a Type 1 and Type 2 AGN. We use
the photoionization code XSTAR and take into account the most up-to-date and complete atomic data
and line list. Our main results are the following: 1) for a fixed value of the optical depth parameter,
$M$ is not a monotonic function of the photoionization parameter $\xi$. Although $M$ starts to decrease
with $\xi$ for $\xi> 1$ as shown by others, this decrease in our calculations is relatively gradual
and in fact $M$ can increase by a factor of few at $\xi \approx 10-1000$ (details depend on the assumed
SED). The main dynamically relevant effect of this behavior is that the multiplier can stay larger
than 1 for $\xi$ as high as $1000$; 2) at these same $\xi$ for which the multiplier is higher than in
previous calculations, the gas is thermally unstable to isobaric perturbations. We discuss implications
of our results in the context of AGN winds that are observed in the UV and X-ray bands, and we confirm
previous findings that the force multiplier depends on very many lines, not a few very optically
thick lines.
