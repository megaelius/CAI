As of now, all analogue gravity models available in the literature deal with the emergence of an acoustic
geometry through linear perturbations of transonic fluids only. It has never been investigated
whether the analogue gravity phenomena is solely a consequence of linear perturbations, or rather
a generic property of arbitrary perturbations of inhomogeneous, inviscid and irrotational fluids.
In the present work, for the first time in the literature, we demonstrate that acoustic spacetimes
may be formed through higher order non-linear perturbations, and thus establish that analogue
gravity phenomena is rather more general than what was thought before. We consider spherically
accreting astrophysical systems as a natural classical analogue gravity model, and develop a formalism
to investigate non-linear perturbations of such accretion flows to arbitrary order. Our iterative
approach involves a coupled set of equations for the mass accretion rate and the density of the fluid.
In particular, we demonstrate that the wave equation for the mass accretion rate involves an acoustic
metric which can be perturbatively constructed to all orders. We numerically solve the coupled
equations about the leading transonic Bondi flow solution. This analysis uses boundary conditions
set to the original unperturbed values, with the time dependence of the mass accretion rate perturbation
taken to be exponentially damped. The perturbed solutions indicate that second order and higher
perturbations of the metric generically cause the original acoustic horizon to oscillate and change
in size. We explain this phenomenon in detail and its implications on non-linear perturbations
of accretion flows in general.
