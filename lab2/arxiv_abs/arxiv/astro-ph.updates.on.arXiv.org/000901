Knowledge of late K and M dwarf metallicities can be used to guide planet searches and constrain planet
formation models. However, the determination of metallicities of late-type stars is difficult
because visible wavelength spectra of their cool atmospheres contain many overlapping absorption
lines, preventing the measurement of equivalent widths. We present new methods, and improved calibrations
of existing methods, to determine metallicities of late-K and M dwarfs from moderate resolution
(1300 < R < 2000) visible and infrared spectra. We select a sample of 112 wide binary systems
that contain a late-type companion to a solar-type primary star. Our sample includes 62 primary
stars with previously published metallicities, as well as 50 stars with metallicities determined
from our own observations. We use our sample to empirically determine which features in the spectrum
of the companion are best correlated with the metallicity of the primary. We derive metallicity
calibrations for different wavelength ranges, and show that it is possible to get metallicities
reliable to < 0.10 dex using either visible, J, H, or K band spectra. Our calibrations are applicable
to dwarfs with metallicities of -1.04 < [Fe/H]< +0.56 and spectral types from K7 to M5. Lastly,
we use our sample of wide binaries to test and refine existing calibrations to determine M dwarf metallicities.
We find that the zeta parameter, which measures the ratio of TiO can CaH bands, is correlated with
[Fe/H] for super-solar metallicities, and zeta does not always correctly identify metal-poor
M dwarfs. We also find that existing calibrations in the K and H band are quite reliable for stars with
[Fe/H] > -0.5, but are less useful for more metal-poor stars.
