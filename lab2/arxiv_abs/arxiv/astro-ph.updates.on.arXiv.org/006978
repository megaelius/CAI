We use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the role of feedback from accreting
black holes on the evolution of sizes, compactness, stellar core density and specific star-formation
of massive galaxies with stellar masses of $ M_{star} > 10^{10.9} M_{\odot}$. We perform two sets
of cosmological zoom-in simulations of 30 halos to z=0: (1) without black holes and Active Galactic
Nucleus (AGN) feedback and (2) with AGN feedback arising from winds and X-ray radiation. We find
that AGN feedback can alter the stellar density distribution, reduce the core density within the
central 1 kpc by 0.3 dex from z=1, and enhance the size growth of massive galaxies. We also find that
galaxies simulated with AGN feedback evolve along similar tracks to those characterized by observations
in specific star formation versus compactness. We confirm that AGN feedback plays an important
role in transforming galaxies from blue compact galaxies into red extended galaxies in two ways:
(1) it effectively quenches the star formation, transforming blue compact galaxies into compact
quiescent galaxies and (2) it also removes and prevents new accretion of cold gas, shutting down
in-situ star formation and causing subsequent mergers to be gas-poor or mixed. Gas poor minor mergers
then build up an extended stellar envelope. AGN feedback also puffs up the central region through
the fast AGN driven winds as well as the slow expulsion of gas while the black hole is quiescent. Without
AGN feedback, large amounts of gas accumulate in the central region, triggering star formation
and leading to overly massive blue galaxies with dense stellar cores.
