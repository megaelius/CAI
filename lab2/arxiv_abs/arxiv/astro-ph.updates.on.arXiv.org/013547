The magnetar Swift J1818.0-1607 was discovered in March 2020 when Swift revealed a 9 ms hard X-ray
burst and long-lived outburst. Prompt X-ray observations revealed a spin period of $1.36$ s, soon
confirmed by the detection of radio pulsations. We report here on the analysis of the Swift} burst
and follow-up X-ray and radio observations. The burst average luminosity was $L_{\rm burst} \sim2\times
10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (at 4.8 kpc). Simultaneous observations with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR three
days after the burst provided a source spectrum well fit by an absorbed blackbody ($N_{\rm H} =(1.22\pm0.03)
\times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $kT = 1.19\pm0.02$ keV) plus a power-law ($\Gamma=0.1_{-1.4}^{+1.2}$)
in the 0.3-20 keV band, with a luminosity of $\sim$$7\times10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, dominated by
the blackbody emission. From our timing analysis, we derive a dipolar magnetic field $B \sim 7\times10^{14}$
G, spin-down luminosity $\dot{E}_{\rm rot} \sim 1.4\times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and characteristic
age of 240 yr, the shortest currently known. Archival observations led to an upper limit on the quiescent
luminosity $< 6.5\times10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$, lower than the value expected from magnetar cooling
models. A 1 hr radio observation with the Sardinia Radio Telescope detected a number of strong and
short radio pulses at 1.5 GHz, in addition to regular pulsed emission; they were emitted at an average
rate 0.9 min$^{-1}$ and accounted for $\sim$50% of the total pulsed radio fluence. We conclude that
Swift J1818.0-1607 is a peculiar magnetar belonging to the small, diverse group of young neutron
stars with properties straddling those of rotationally and magnetically powered pulsars.
