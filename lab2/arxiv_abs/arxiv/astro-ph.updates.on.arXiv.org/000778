Damped Ly\alpha\ systems (DLAs) observed in the quasar spectra are characterized by a high neutral
hydrogen column density $N_{HI}>2\times 10^{20}{\rm\ cm^{-2}}$. The absorption wing profiles
are often fitted using the Voigt function due to the fact that the scattering cross section near resonant
line center is approximately described by the Lorentzian function. Since a hydrogen atom has infinitely
many $p$ states that participate in the electric dipole interaction, the cross section starts to
deviate from the Lorentzian in an asymmetric way in the line wing regions. We investigate this asymmetry
in the absorption line profiles around Ly\alpha\ and Ly\beta\ as a function of the neutral hydrogen
column density $N_{HI}$. In terms of $\Delta\lambda\equiv\lambda-\lambda_\alpha$ we expand
the Kramers-Heisenberg formula around Ly\alpha\ to find $\sigma(\lambda)\simeq (0.5 f_{12})^2\sigma_{T}(\Delta\lambda/\lambda_\alpha)^{-2}[1+3.792
(\Delta\lambda/\lambda_\alpha)]$, where $f_{12}$ and $\sigma_T$ are the oscillator strength
of Ly$\alpha$ and the Thomson scattering cross section, respectively. In terms of $\Delta\lambda_2\equiv\lambda-\lambda_\beta$
in the vicinity of Ly\beta, the total scattering cross section, given as the sum of cross sections
for Rayleigh and Raman scattering, is shown to be $\sigma(\lambda)\simeq \sigma_T(0.5f_{13})^2(1+R_0)
(\Delta\lambda_2/\lambda_\beta)^{-2}[1-24.68(\Delta\lambda_2/\lambda_\beta)]$ with
$f_{13}$ and the factor $R_0=0.1342$ being the oscillator strength for Ly\beta\ and the ratio of
Raman cross section to Rayleigh cross section, respectively. A redward asymmetry develops around
Ly\alpha\ whereas a blue asymmetry is obtained for Ly\beta. The absorption center shifts are found
to be almost proportional to the neutral hydrogen column density.
