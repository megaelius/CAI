We present an analysis of the role of feedback in shaping the neutral hydrogen (HI) content of simulated
disc galaxies. For our analysis, we have used two realisations of two separate Milky Way-like (~L*)
discs - one employing a conservative feedback scheme (MUGS), the other significantly more energetic
(MaGICC). To quantify the impact of these schemes, we generate zeroth moment (surface density)
maps of the inferred HI distribution; construct power spectra associated with the underlying structure
of the simulated cold ISM, in addition to their radial surface density and velocity dispersion profiles.
Our results are compared with a parallel, self-consistent, analysis of empirical data from THINGS
(The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey). Single power-law fits (P~k^gamma) to the power spectra of the stronger-feedback
(MaGICC) runs (over spatial scales corresponding to 0.5 kpc to 20 kpc) result in slopes consistent
with those seen in the THINGS sample (gamma = -2.5). The weaker-feedback (MUGS) runs exhibit shallower
power law slopes (gamma = -1.2). The power spectra of the MaGICC simulations are more consistent
though with a two-component fit, with a flatter distribution of power on larger scales (i.e., gamma
= -1.4 for scales in excess of 2 kpc) and a steeper slope on scales below 1 kpc (gamma = -5), qualitatively
consistent with empirical claims, as well as our earlier work on dwarf discs. The radial HI surface
density profiles of the MaGICC discs show a clear exponential behaviour, while those of the MUGS
suite are essentially flat; both behaviours are encountered in nature, although the THINGS sample
is more consistent with our stronger (MaGICC) feedback runs.
