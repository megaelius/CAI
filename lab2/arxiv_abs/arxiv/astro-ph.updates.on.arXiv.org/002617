We investigate the solar phenomena associated with the origin of the solar energetic particle (SEP)
event observed on 2013 April 11 by a number of spacecraft distributed in the inner heliosphere over
a broad range of heliolongitudes. We use Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) and white-light coronagraph
observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory
(SOHO) and the twin Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory spacecraft (STEREO-A and STEREO-B)
to determine the angular extent of the EUV wave and coronal mass ejection (CME) associated with the
origin of the SEP event. We compare the estimated release time of SEPs observed at each spacecraft
with the arrival time of the structures associated with the CME at the footpoints of the field lines
connecting each spacecraft with the Sun. Whereas the arrival of the EUV wave and CME-driven shock
at the footpoint of STEREO-B is consistent, within uncertainties, with the release time of the particles
observed by this spacecraft, the EUV wave never reached the footpoint of the field lines connecting
near-Earth observers with the Sun, even though an intense SEP event was observed there. We show that
the west flank of the CME-driven shock propagating at high altitudes above the solar surface was
most likely the source of the particles observed near Earth, but it did not leave any EUV trace on the
solar disk. We conclude that the angular extent of the EUV wave on the solar surface did not agree with
the longitudinal extent of the SEP event in the heliosphere. Hence EUV waves cannot be used reliably
as a proxy for the solar phenomena that accelerates and injects energetic particles over broad ranges
of longitudes.
