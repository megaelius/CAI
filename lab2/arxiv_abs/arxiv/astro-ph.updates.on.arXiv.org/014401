Aims: The aim of this work is to study the application of the artificial neural networks guided by
the autoencoder architecture as a method for precise reconstruction of the neutron star equation
of state, using their observable parameters: masses, radii and tidal deformabilities. In addition
we study how well the neutron star radius can be reconstructed using the gravitational-wave only
observations of tidal deformability, i.e. quantities which are not related in a straightforward
way. Methods: Application of artificial neural network in the equation of state reconstruction
exploits the non-linear potential of this machine learning model. Since each neuron in the network
is basically a non-linear function, it is possible to create a complex mapping between the input
sets of observations and the output equation of state table. Within the supervised training paradigm,
we construct a few hidden layer deep neural network on a generated data set, consisting of a realistic
equation of state for the neutron star crust connected with a piecewise relativistic polytropes
dense core, with parameters representative to the state-of-the art realistic equations of state.
Results: We demonstrate the performance of our machine learning implementation with respect to
the simulated cases with varying number of observations and measurement uncertainties. Furthermore
we study the impact of the neutron star mass distributions on the results. Finally, we test the reconstruction
of the equation of state trained on parametric polytropic training set using the simulated mass--radius
and mass--tidal-deformability sequences based on realistic equations of state. Neural networks
trained with a limited data set are able to generalize the mapping between global parameters and
equation of state input tables for realistic models.
