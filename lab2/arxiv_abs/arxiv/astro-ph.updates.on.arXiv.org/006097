We present a large-scale study of diffuse X-ray emission in the nearby massive stellar association
Cygnus OB2 as part of the Chandra Cygnus OB2 Legacy Program. We used 40 Chandra X-ray ACIS-I observations
covering $\sim$1.0 deg$^2$. After removing 7924 point-like sources detected in our survey, background-corrected
X-ray emission, the adaptive smoothing reveals large-scale diffuse X-ray emission. Diffuse emission
was detected in the sub-bands Soft [0.5 : 1.2] and Medium [1.2 : 2.5], and marginally in the Hard [2.5
: 7.0] keV band. From X-ray spectral analysis of stacked spectra we compute a total [0.5 : 7.0 keV]
diffuse X-ray luminosity of L$_{\rm x}^{\rm diff}\approx$4.2$\times$10$^{\rm 34}$ erg s$^{-1}$,
characterized with plasma temperature components at kT$\approx$ 0.11, 0.40 and 1.18 keV, respectively.
The HI absorption column density corresponding to these temperatures has a distribution consistent
with N$_{\rm H}$ = 0.43, 0.80 and 1.39 $\times$10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. The extended medium band energy
emission likely arises from O-type stellar winds thermalized by wind-wind collisions in the most
populated regions of the association, while the soft band emission probably arises from less energetic
termination shocks against the surrounding Interstellar-Medium. Super-soft and Soft diffuse
emission appears more widely dispersed and intense than the medium band emission. The diffuse X-ray
emission is generally spatially coincident with low-extinction regions that we attribute to the
ubiquitous influence of powerful stellar winds from massive stars and their interaction with the
local Interstellar-Medium. Diffuse X-ray emission is volume-filling, rather than edge-brightened,
oppositely to other star-forming regions. We reveal the first observational evidence of X-ray
haloes around some evolved massive stars.
