Much of the baryonic matter in the Universe, including the most active and luminous sources, are
best studied in the X-ray band. Key advances in X-ray optics and detectors have paved the way for the
Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), a Probe-class mission that is a major improvement over
Chandra, which has generated a steady stream of important discoveries for the past 2 decades. AXIS
can be launched in the late 2020s and will transform our understanding in several major areas of astrophysics,
including the growth and fueling of supermassive black holes, galaxy formation and evolution,
the microphysics of cosmic plasmas, the time-variable universe, and a wide variety of cutting-edge
studies. Relative to Chandra, the AXIS PSF is nearly twice as sharp on-axis; its field of view for
subarcsecond imaging 70 times larger by area; its effective area at 1 keV is 10 times larger. The low-Earth
orbit ensures a low and stable detector background, resulting in 50 times greater sensitivity than
Chandra for extended sources. AXIS has a rapid repointing response with operations similar to Swift,
but is 100 times more sensitive for time-domain science. These capabilities open up a vast discovery
space and complement the next generation of astronomical observatories. A high-spectral-resolution
mission (Athena) operating at the same time as a high-angular-resolution mission (AXIS) greatly
increases the range of scientific discovery. AXIS will use lightweight X-ray optics made of thin
single-crystal silicon mirrors developed at NASA Goddard. The detector array builds on a long legacy
of X-ray CCD and provides improved photon localization, much faster readout time, and broader energy
band. The estimated mission costs are consistent with the $1B Probe mission cost guideline.
