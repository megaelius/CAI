The preparation of science objectives of the ESA's PLATO space mission will require the implementation
of hare-and-hound exercises relying on the massive generation of representative simulated light-curves.
We developed a light-curve simulator named the PLATO Solar-like Light-curve Simulator (PSLS)
in order to generate light-curves representative of typical PLATO targets, i.e. showing simultaneously
solar-like oscillations, stellar granulation, and magnetic activity. At the same time, PSLS also
aims at mimicking in a realistic way the random noise and the systematic errors representative of
the PLATO multi-telescope concept. To quantify the instrumental systematic errors, we performed
a series of simulations at pixel level that include various relevant sources of perturbations expected
for PLATO. From the simulated pixels, we extract the photometry as planned on-board. The simulated
light-curves are then corrected for instrumental effects using the instrument Point Spread Functions
reconstructed on the basis of a microscanning technique that will be operated during the in-flight
calibration phases. These corrected light-curves are then fitted by a parametric model, which
we incorporated in PSLS. We show that the instrumental systematic errors dominate the signal only
at frequencies below 20muHz and are found to mainly depend on stellar magnitude and on the detector
charge transfer inefficiency. To illustrate how realistic our simulator is, we compared its predictions
with observations made by Kepler on three typical targets and found a good qualitative agreement
with the observations. PSLS reproduces the main properties of expected PLATO light-curves. Its
speed of execution and its inclusion of relevant stellar signals as well as sources of noises representative
of the PLATO cameras make it an indispensable tool for the scientific preparation of the PLATO mission.
