Analog condensed matter systems present an exciting opportunity to simulate early Universe models
in table-top experiments. We consider a recent proposal for an analog condensed matter experiment
to simulate the relativistic quantum decay of the false vacuum. In the proposed experiment, two
ultra-cold condensates are coupled via a time-varying radio-frequency field. The relative phase
of the two condensates in this system is approximately described by a relativistic scalar field
with a potential possessing a series of false and true vacuum local minima. If the system is set up
in a false vacuum, it would then decay to a true vacuum via quantum mechanical tunnelling. Should
such an experiment be realized, it would be possible to answer a number of open questions regarding
non-perturbative phenomena in quantum field theory and early Universe cosmology. In this paper,
we illustrate a possible obstruction: the time-varying coupling that is invoked to create a false
vacuum for the long-wavelength modes of the condensate leads to a destabilization of shorter wavelength
modes within the system via parametric resonance. We focus on an idealized setup in which the two
condensates have identical properties and identical background densities. Describing the system
by the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPE), we use the machinery of Floquet theory to perform
a linear stability analysis, calculating the wavenumber associated with the first instability
band for a variety of experimental parameters. However, we demonstrate that, by tuning the frequency
of the time-varying coupling, it may be possible to push the first instability band outside the validity
of the GPE, where dissipative effects are expected to damp any instabilities. This provides a viable
range of experimental parameters to perform analog experiments of false vacuum decay.
