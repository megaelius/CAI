We present the analysis of Halpha3, an Halpha imaging survey of galaxies selected from the HI ALFALFA
Survey in the Coma Supercluster. By using the Halpha line as a tracer of the "instantaneous" star
formation, complemented with optical colors from SDSS we explore the hypothesis that a morphological
sequence of galaxies of progressively earlier type, lower gas-content exists in the neighborhood
of the Coma cluster, with specific star formation activity decreasing with increasing local galaxy
density and velocity dispersion. In the dwarf regime (8.5<\log(M*)< 9.5) we identify a 4-step
sequence of galaxies with progressively redder colors, i.e. of decreasing specific star formation,
from (1) HI-rich Late-Type Galaxies belonging to the blue-cloud exhibiting extended plus nuclear
star formation, (2) HI-poor LTGs with nuclear star formation only, (3) HI-poor galaxies with no
star formation either extended or nuclear, but with nuclear Post-Star-Burst signature,(4) Early-type
Galaxies in the red-sequence, with no gas or star formation on all scales. Along this sequence the
quenching of the star formation proceeds radially outside-in. The progression toward redder colors
found along this "morphological" (gas content) sequence is comparable to the one obtained increasing
the local galaxy density, from the cosmic filaments (1,2), to the rich clusters (2,3,4). In the dwarf
regime we find evidence for evolution of HI-rich LTGs into ETGs, passing through HI-poor and PSB
galaxies, driven by the environment. We identify ram-pressure as the mechanism most likely responsible
for this transformation. We conclude that infall of low-mass galaxies has proceeded for the last
7.5 Gyr building up the Coma cluster at a rate of approximately 100 galaxies per Gyr.
