Stellar-feedback driven outflows are predicted to play a fundamental role in the baryon cycle of
low-mass galaxies. However, observational constraints of winds in nearby dwarf galaxies are limited
as outflows are transient, intrinsically low-surface brightness features, and, thus, difficult
to detect. Using deep Hapha observations, we search for winds in a sample of twelve nearby dwarfs
(M_* ~ 10^7 - 10^9.3 Msun) which host on-going or recent starbursts. We detect features which we classify
as winds in 6 galaxies, fountain candidates in 5 galaxies, and diffuse ISM in 1 system. Winds are found
preferentially in galaxies with centrally concentrated star formation, while fountains are found
in galaxies with spatially distributed star formation. We suggest that the concentration of star
formation is a predictor for whether a low-mass galaxy will develop a wind. The spatial extent of
all detected ionized gas is limited (<1/10 virial radius) and would still be considered the ISM by
cosmological simulations. Our observations suggest that the majority of material expelled from
dwarfs does not escape to the intergalactic medium but remains in the halo and may be recycled to the
galaxies. Derived mass-loading factors range from 0.2-7 (with only a weak dependency on circular
velocity or stellar mass), in tension with higher values in simulations needed to reproduce realistic
low-mass galaxies and resolve discrepancies with LambdaCDM. The sample is part of the panchromatic
STARBurst IRegular Dwarf Survey - STARBIRDS - designed to characterize the starburst phenomenon
in dwarf galaxies. We also report a previously uncatalogued nearby galaxy (J1118+7913).
