The search for water-rich Earth-sized exoplanets around low-mass stars is rapidly gaining attention
because they represent the best opportunity to characterize habitable planets in the near future.
Understanding the atmospheres of these planets and determining the optimal strategy for characterizing
them through transmission spectroscopy with our upcoming instrumentation is essential in order
to constrain their environments. For this study, we present simulated transmission spectra of
tidally locked Earth-sized ocean-covered planets around late-M to mid-K stellar spectral types,
utilizing GCM modeling results previously published by Kopparapu et al. (2017) as inputs for our
radiative transfer calculations performed using NASA's Planetary Spectrum Generator (psg.gsfc.nasa.gov;
Villanueva et al. (2018)). We identify trends in the depth of H$_2$O spectral features as a function
of planet surface temperature and rotation rate. These trends allow us to calculate the exposure
times necessary to detect water vapor in the atmospheres of aquaplanets through transmission spectroscopy
with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as well as several future flagship space telescope
concepts under consideration (LUVOIR and OST) for a target list constructed from the TESS Input
Catalog (TIC). Our calculations reveal that transmission spectra for water-rich Earth-sized
planets around low-mass stars will be dominated by clouds, with spectral features < 20 ppm, and only
a small subset of TIC stars would allow for the characterization of an ocean planet in the Habitable
Zone. We thus present a careful prioritization of targets that are most amenable to follow-up characterizations
with next-generation instrumentation, in order to assist the community in efficiently utilizing
precious telescope time.
