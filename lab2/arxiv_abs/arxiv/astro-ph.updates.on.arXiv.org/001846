We have spatially resolved five debris disks (HD 30447, HD 35841, HD 141943, HD 191089, and HD 202917)
for the first time in near-infrared scattered light by reanalyzing archival Hubble Space Telescope
(HST)/NICMOS coronagraphic images obtained between 1999 and 2006. One of these disks (HD 202917)
was previously resolved at visible wavelengths using HST/Advanced Camera for Surveys. To obtain
these new disk images, we performed advanced point-spread function subtraction based on the Karhunen-Loeve
Image Projection (KLIP) algorithm on recently reprocessed NICMOS data with improved detector
artifact removal (Legacy Archive PSF Library And Circumstellar Environments Legacy program).
Three of the disks (HD 30447, HD 35841, and HD 141943) appear edge-on, while the other two (HD 191089
and HD 202917) appear inclined. The inclined disks have been sculpted into rings; in particular,
the disk around HD 202917 exhibits strong asymmetries. All five host stars are young (8-40 Myr),
nearby (40-100 pc) F and G stars, and one (HD 141943) is a close analog to the young sun during the epoch
of terrestrial planet formation. Our discoveries increase the number of debris disks resolved
in scattered light from 19 to 23 (a 21% increase). Given their youth, proximity, and brightness (V
= 7.2 to 8.5), these targets are excellent candidates for follow-up investigations of planet formation
at visible wavelengths using the HST/STIS coronagraph, at near-infrared wavelengths with the
Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) and Very Large Telescope (VLT)/SPHERE, and at thermal infrared wavelengths
with the James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam and MIRI coronagraphs.
