Water ($\rm H_{2}O$), one of the most ubiquitous molecules in the universe, has bright millimeter-wave
emission lines easily observed at high-redshift with the current generation of instruments. The
low excitation transition of $\rm H_{2}O$, p$-$$\rm H_{2}O$(202 $-$ 111) ($\nu_{rest}$ = 987.927
GHz) is known to trace the far-infrared (FIR) radiation field independent of the presence of active
galactic nuclei (AGN) over many orders-of-magnitude in FIR luminosity (L$_{\rm FIR}$). This indicates
that this transition arises mainly due to star formation. In this paper, we present spatially ($\sim$0.5
arcsec corresponding to $\sim$1 kiloparsec) and spectrally resolved ($\sim$100 kms$^{-1}$)
observations of p$-$$\rm H_{2}O$(202 $-$ 111) in a sample of four strong gravitationally lensed
high-redshift galaxies with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). In addition
to increasing the sample of luminous ($ > $ $10^{12}$L$_{\odot}$) galaxies observed with $\rm H_{2}O$,
this paper examines the L$_{\rm H_{2}O}$/L$_{\rm FIR}$ relation on resolved scales for the first
time at high-redshift. We find that L$_{\rm H_{2}O}$ is correlated with L$_{\rm FIR}$ on both global
and resolved kiloparsec scales within the galaxy in starbursts and AGN with average L$_{\rm H_{2}O}$/L$_{\rm
FIR}$ =$2.76^{+2.15}_{-1.21}\times10^{-5}$. We find that the scatter in the observed L$_{\rm
H_{2}O}$/L$_{\rm FIR}$ relation does not obviously correlate with the effective temperature
of the dust spectral energy distribution (SED) or the molecular gas surface density. This is a first
step in developing p$-$$\rm H_{2}O$(202 $-$ 111) as a resolved star formation rate (SFR) calibrator.
