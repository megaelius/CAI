By exploring more than sixty thousand quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5, Steinhardt
& Elvis discovered a sub-Eddington boundary and a redshift-dependent drop-off at higher black
hole mass, possible clues to the growth history of massive black holes. Our contribution to this
special issue of Universe amounts to an application of a model for black hole accretion and jet formation
to these observations. For illustrative purposes we include about 100,000 data points from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 where the sub-Eddington boundary is also visible, and propose
a theoretical picture that explains these features. By appealing to thin disk theory and both the
lower accretion efficiency and the time evolution of jetted quasars compared to non-jetted quasars
in our 'gap paradigm', we explain two features of the sub-Eddington boundary. First, we show that
a drop-off on the quasar mass-luminosity plane for larger black hole mass occurs at all redshifts.
But the fraction of jetted quasars is directly related to the merger function in this paradigm, which
means the jetted quasar fraction drops with decrease in redshift, which allows us to explain a second
feature of the sub-Eddington boundary, namely a redshift dependence of the slope of the quasar mass-luminosity
boundary at high black hole mass stemming from a change in radiative efficiency with time. We are
able to reproduce the mass dependence of, as well as the oscillating behavior in, the slope of the
sub-Eddington boundary as a function of time. The basic physical idea involves retrograde accretion
occurring only for a subset of the more massive black holes which implies that most spinning black
holes in our model are prograde accretors. In short, this paper amounts to a qualitative overview
of how a sub-Eddington boundary naturally emerges in the gap paradigm.
