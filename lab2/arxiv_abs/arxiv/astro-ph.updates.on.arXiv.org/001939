We study a sequence of eruptive events including filament eruption, a GOES C4.3 flare and a coronal
mass ejection. We aim to identify the possible trigger(s) and precursor(s) of the filament destabilisation;
investigate flare kernel characteristics; flare ribbons/kernels formation and evolution; study
the interrelation of the filament-eruption/flare/coronal-mass-ejection phenomena as part
of the integral active-region magnetic field configuration; determine H alpha line profile evolution
during the eruptive phenomena. Multi-instrument observations are analysed including H$\alpha$
line profiles, speckle images at H$\alpha$-0.8 \AA\ and H$\alpha$+0.8 \AA\ from IBIS at DST/NSO,
EUV images and magnetograms from the SDO, coronagraph images from STEREO and the X-ray flux observations
from FERMI and GOES. We establish that the filament destabilisation and eruption are the main trigger
for the flaring activity. A surge-like event with a circular ribbon in one of the filament footpoints
is determined as the possible trigger of the filament destabilisation. Plasma draining in this
footpoint is identified as the precursor for the filament eruption. A magnetic flux emergence prior
to the filament destabilisation followed by a high rate of flux cancelation of $1.34\times10^{16}$
Mx s$^{-1}$ is found during the flare activity. The flare X-ray lightcurves reveal three phases
that are found to be associated with three different ribbons occurring consecutively. A kernel
from each ribbon is selected and analysed. The kernel lightcurves and H alpha line profiles reveal
that the emission increase in the line centre is stronger than that in the line wings. A delay of around
5-6 mins is found between the increase in the line centre and the occurrence of red asymmetry. Only
red asymmetry is observed in the ribbons during the impulsive phases. Blue asymmetry is only associated
with the dynamic filament.
