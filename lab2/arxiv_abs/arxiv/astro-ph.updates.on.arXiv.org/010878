As galaxy surveys become more precise and push to smaller scales, the need for accurate covariances
beyond the vanilla Gaussian formula becomes more acute. Here, I investigate the analytical implementation
and impact of non-Gaussian covariance terms that I uncovered for galaxy clustering (Lacasa 2018).
Braiding covariance is such a new class, that gets contribution both from in-survey and super-survey
modes. I present an approximation to Braiding covariance making it fast to compute numerically.
I show that accounting for Braiding covariance is necessary to include other non-Gaussian terms:
the in-survey 2-, 3- and 4-halo covariance, which quantify coupling between large and small scales,
to ensure the positivity of the covariance matrix. I then quantify the impact on parameter constraints,
with forecasts for a Euclid-like survey. Compared to the Gaussian case, Braiding and in-survey
covariances significantly increase the error bars on all cosmological parameters of the wCDM model,
in particular by 50% for w. The error bars on Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) parameters are also
affected between 12% and 39%. Accounting for super-sample covariance (SSC) also increases parameter
errors, by 90% for w and between 7% and 64% for HOD. In total, non-Gaussianity increases the error
bar on w by 120% (between 15% and 80% for other cosmological parameters), and the HOD error bars between
17% and 85%. Accounting for the 1-halo trispectrum term on top of SSC is not sufficient to capture
the full non-Gaussian impact: Braiding and the rest of in-survey covariance have to be accounted
for. I finally discuss why the inclusion of non-Gaussianity generally eases up parameter degeneracies,
making cosmological constraints more robust to astrophysical uncertainties. Data and a notebook
