A number of Local Group dwarf galaxies are known to have two spatially segregated stellar metallicity
populations, a centrally concentrated metal-rich population and a more extended metal-poor population.
In this work we discuss mechanisms that lead to the formation of two spatially segregated metallicity
populations. Using a set of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of Local Group-like environments,
we select a sample of satellite and field galaxies, spanning the stellar mass range 3x10^6-1x10^9
M_sol, that exhibit bimodality in their metallicity distributions. Among those we identify a subsample
with a particularly strong spatial segregation in the two populations. We find three distinct mechanisms
for the formation of the two populations, one occurring preferentially in field dwarfs, one that
is exclusive to satellite galaxies and one that may occur in both. In field dwarfs and in a small fraction
of satellites, a merger causes the metal-poor stars to migrate to larger radii and encourages the
available gas to sink to the centre of the dwarf. Most of the gas is subsequently blown out of the halo
through star formation feedback, but the remaining gas is consumed in the formation of a metal-rich
population. In the exclusive case of satellites that have retained some of their gas at infall, it
is the compression of this gas by ram pressure near pericentre that triggers the formation of metal-rich
stars. Additionally, in a small number of field and satellite dwarfs, interactions with gaseous
cosmic filaments and other galaxies can result in the formation of a metal-rich population through
gas compression induced by ram pressure.
