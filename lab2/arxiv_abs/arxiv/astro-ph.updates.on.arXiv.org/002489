Our recent estimates of galaxy counts and the luminosity density in the near-infrared (Keenan et
al. 2010, 2012) indicated that the local universe may be under-dense on radial scales of several
hundred megaparsecs (Mpc). Such a large-scale local under-density could introduce significant
biases in the measurement and interpretation of cosmological observables, such as the inferred
effects of dark energy on the rate of expansion. In Keenan et al. (2013), we measured the K-band luminosity
density as a function of distance from us to test for such a local under-density. We made this measurement
over the redshift range 0.01 < z < 0.2 (radial distances D ~ 50-800 Mpc). We found that the shape
of the K-band luminosity function is relatively constant as a function of distance and environment.
We derive a local (z < 0.07, D < 300 Mpc) K-band luminosity density that agrees well with previously
published studies. At z > 0.07, we measure an increasing luminosity density that by z~ 0.1 rises
to a value of ~1.5 times higher than that measured locally. This implies that the stellar mass density
follows a similar trend. Assuming that the underlying dark matter distribution is traced by this
luminous matter, this suggests that the local mass density may be lower than the global mass density
of the universe at an amplitude and on a scale that is sufficient to introduce significant biases
into the measurement of basic cosmological observables. At least one study has shown that an under-density
of roughly this amplitude and scale could resolve the apparent tension between direct local measurements
of the Hubble constant and those inferred by Planck team. Other theoretical studies have concluded
that such an under-density could account for what looks like an accelerating expansion, even when
no dark energy is present.
