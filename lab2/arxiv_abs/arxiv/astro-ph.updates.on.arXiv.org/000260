We have conducted a detailed multi-wavelength study of the peculiar planetary nebula Abell 48 and
its central star. We present evidence for a new classification of the nucleus as a helium-rich, hydrogen-deficient
star of type [WN4], one of only two currently known examples of its type. The evidence for either a
massive WN or a low-mass [WN] interpretation is critically examined, and we firmly conclude that
Abell 48 is a planetary nebula around an evolved low-mass star, rather than a Population I ejecta
nebula. Importantly, the surrounding nebula has a morphology typical of planetary nebulae, and
is not enriched in nitrogen, and thus not the 'peeled atmosphere' of a massive star. We estimate a
distance of 1.6 kpc and a reddening, E(B-V) = 1.90 mag, the latter value clearly showing the nebula
lies on the near side of the Galactic bar, and therefore cannot be a massive WN star. The ionized mass
(0.3 M_sun) and electron density (700 cm^-3) are typical of middle-aged PNe. The observed stellar
spectrum was compared to a grid of models from the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) grid. The best fit temperature
is 71 kK, and the atmospheric composition is dominated by helium (>86 per cent by mass), with about
3-4 per cent nitrogen present. An upper limit on the hydrogen abundance is 10 per cent. Our results
are in good agreement with the recent study of Todt et al. The unusually high nitrogen fraction is
higher than any other low-mass H-deficient star, and is not explained by current post-AGB models.
We give a discussion of the implications of this discovery for the late-stage evolution of intermediate-mass
stars. There is now tentative evidence for two distinct helium-dominated post-AGB lineages, separate
to the He+C dominated surface compositions produced by a late thermal pulse. Further theoretical
work is needed to explain these recent discoveries.
