We present a quantitative analysis of the largest contiguous maps of projected mass density obtained
from gravitational lensing shear. We use data from the 154 deg2 covered by the Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope Lensing Survey. Our study is the first attempt to quantitatively characterize the scientific
value of lensing maps, which could serve in the future as a complementary approach to the study of
the dark universe with gravitational lensing. We show that mass maps contain unique cosmological
information beyond that of traditional two-points statistical analysis techniques. Using a series
of numerical simulations, we first show how, reproducing the CFHTLenS observing conditions, gravitational
lensing inversion provides a reliable estimate of the projected matter distribution of large scale
structure. We validate our analysis by quantifying the robustness of the maps with various statistical
estimators. We then apply the same process to the CFHTLenS data. We find that the 2-points correlation
function of the projected mass is consistent with the cosmological analysis performed on the shear
correlation function discussed in the CFHTLenS companion papers. The maps also lead to a significant
measurement of the third order moment of the projected mass, which is in agreement with analytic
predictions, and to a marginal detection of the fourth order moment. Tests for residual systematics
are found to be consistent with zero for the statistical estimators we used. A new approach for the
comparison of the reconstructed mass map to that predicted from the galaxy distribution reveals
the existence of giant voids in the dark matter maps as large as 3 degrees on the sky. Our analysis shows
that lensing mass maps can be used for new techniques such as peak statistics and the morphological
analysis of the projected dark matter distribution.
