Observations of young star clusters reveal that the high-mass end of the cluster initial mass function
(CIMF) deviates from a pure power-law and instead truncates exponentially. We investigate the
effects of this truncation on the formation of globular cluster (GC) systems by updating our analytic
model for cluster formation and evolution, which is based on dark matter halo merger trees coupled
to empirical galactic scaling relations, and has been shown in previous work to match a wide array
of observational data. The cutoff masses of $M_c=10^{6.5} M_{\odot}$ or $10^{7}M_{\odot}$ match
many scaling relations: between the GC system mass and host halo mass, between the average metallicity
of the GC system and host halo mass, and the distribution of cluster masses. This range of $M_c$ agrees
with indirect measurements from extragalactic GC systems. Models with $M_c<10^{6.5}M_{\odot}$
cannot reproduce the observed GC metallicity and mass distributions in massive galaxies. The slope
of the mass-metallicity relation for metal-poor clusters (blue tilt) for all $M_c$ models is consistent
with observations within their errors, when measured using the same method. We introduce an alternative,
more robust fitting method, which reveals a trend of increasing tilt slope for lower $M_c$. In our
model the blue tilt arises because the metal-poor clusters form in relatively low-mass galaxies
which lack sufficient cold gas to sample the CIMF at highest masses. Massive blue clusters form in
progressively more massive galaxies and inherit their higher metallicity. The metal-rich clusters
do not exhibit such a tilt because they form in significantly more massive galaxies, which have enough
cold gas to fully sample the CIMF.
