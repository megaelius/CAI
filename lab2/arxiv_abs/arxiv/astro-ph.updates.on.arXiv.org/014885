Dense molecular filaments are central to the star formation process, but the detailed manner in
which they fragment into prestellar cores is not yet well understood. Here, we investigate the fragmentation
properties and dynamical state of several star-forming filaments in the X-shape Nebula region
of the California MC, in an effort to shed some light on this issue. We used multi-wavelength far-infrared
images from Herschel and the getsources and getfilaments extraction methods to identify dense
cores and filaments and derive their basic properties. We also used a map of $\rm ^{13}CO (2-1)$ emission
from SMT 10m submillimeter telescope to constrain the dynamical state of the filaments. We identified
10 filaments, as well as 57 dense cores. Two star-forming filaments (# 8 and # 10) stand out in that
they harbor quasi-periodic chains of dense cores with a typical projected core spacing of $\sim$0.15
pc. These two filaments have thermally supercritical line masses and are not static. Filament~8
exhibits a prominent transverse velocity gradient, suggesting that it is accreting gas from the
parent cloud gas reservoir. In both cases, the observed (projected) core spacing is similar to the
filament width and significantly shorter than the canonical separation of $\sim \,$4 times the
filament width predicted by classical cylinder fragmentation theory. We suggest that continuous
accretion of gas onto the two star-forming filaments, as well as geometrical bending of the filaments,
may account for the observed core spacing. Our findings suggest that the characteristic fragmentation
lengthscale of molecular filaments is quite sensitive to external perturbations from the parent
cloud, such as gravitational accretion of ambient material.
