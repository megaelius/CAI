We resolve spatially the star formation history of 300 nearby galaxies from the CALIFA integral
field survey to investigate: a) the radial structure and gradients of the present stellar populations
properties as a function of the Hubble type; and b) the role that plays the galaxy stellar mass and
stellar mass surface density in governing the star formation history and metallicity enrichment
of spheroids and the disks of galaxies. We apply the fossil record method based on spectral synthesis
techniques to recover spatially and temporally resolved maps of stellar population properties
of spheroids and spirals with galaxy mass from 10$^9$ to 7$\times$10$^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$. The individual
radial profiles of the stellar mass surface density ($\mu_{*}$), stellar extinction (A$_{V}$),
luminosity weighted ages ($\langle$ log age $\rangle_{L}$), and mass weighted metallicity ($\langle$
log Z/Z$_{\odot}$$\rangle_{M}$) are stacked in seven bins of galaxy morphology (E, S0, Sa, Sb,
Sbc, Sc and Sd). All these properties show negative gradients as a sight of the inside-out growth
of massive galaxies. However, the gradients depend on the Hubble type in different ways. For the
same galaxy mass, E and S0 galaxies show the largest inner gradients in $\mu_{*}$; and Andromeda-like
galaxies (Sb with log M$_{*}$(M$_{\odot}$) $\sim$ 11) show the largest inner age and metallicity
gradients. In average, spiral galaxies have a stellar metallicity gradient $\sim$ -0.1 dex per
half-light radius, in agreement with the value estimated for the ionized gas oxygen abundance gradient
by CALIFA. A global (M$_{*}$-driven) and local ($\mu_{*}$- driven) stellar metallicity relation
are derived. We find that in disks, the stellar mass surface density regulates the stellar metallicity;
in spheroids, the galaxy stellar mass dominates the physics of star formation and chemical enrichment.
