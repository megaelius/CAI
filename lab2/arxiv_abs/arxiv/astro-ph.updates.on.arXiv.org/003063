Seven-year long seeing-free observations of solar magnetic fields with the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) were used to study the sources of the solar
mean magnetic field, SMMF, defined as the net line-of-sight magnetic flux divided over the solar
disk area. To evaluate the contribution of different regions to the SMMF, we separated all the pixels
of each SDO/HMI magnetogram into three subsets: weak (B_W), intermediate (B_I), and strong (B_S)
fields. The B_W component represents areas with magnetic flux densities below the chosen threshold;
the B_I component is mainly represented by network fields, remains of decayed active regions (ARs),
and ephemeral regions. The B_S component consists of magnetic elements in ARs. To derive the contribution
of a subset to the total SMMF, the linear regression coefficients between the corresponding component
and the SMMF were calculated. We found that: i) when the threshold level of 30 Mx cm^-2 is applied,
the B_I and B_S components together contribute from 65% to 95% of the SMMF, while the fraction of the
occupied area varies in a range of 2-6% of the disk area; ii) as the threshold magnitude is lowered
to 6 Mx cm^-2, the contribution from B_I+B_S grows to 98%, and the fraction of the occupied area reaches
the value of about 40% of the solar disk. In summary, we found that regardless of the threshold level,
only a small part of the solar disk area contributes to the SMMF. This means that the photospheric
magnetic structure is an intermittent, inherently porous medium, resembling a percolation cluster.
These findings suggest that the long-standing concept that continuous vast unipolar areas on the
solar surface are the source of the SMMF may need to be reconsidered.
