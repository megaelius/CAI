The Atacama Large millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) makes use of water vapour radiometers
(WVR), which monitor the atmospheric water vapour line at 183 GHz along the line of sight above each
antenna to correct for phase delays introduced by the wet component of the troposphere. The application
of WVR derived phase corrections improve the image quality and facilitate successful observations
in weather conditions that were classically marginal or poor. We present work to indicate that a
scaling factor applied to the WVR solutions can act to further improve the phase stability and image
quality of ALMA data. We find reduced phase noise statistics for 62 out of 75 datasets from the long-baseline
science verification campaign after a WVR scaling factor is applied. The improvement of phase noise
translates to an expected coherence improvement in 39 datasets. When imaging the bandpass source,
we find 33 of the 39 datasets show an improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) between a few
to ~30 percent. There are 23 datasets where the S/N of the science image is improved: 6 by <1%, 11 between
1 and 5%, and 6 above 5%. The higher frequencies studied (band 6 and band 7) are those most improved,
specifically datasets with low precipitable water vapour (PWV), <1mm, where the dominance of the
wet component is reduced. Although these improvements are not profound, phase stability improvements
via the WVR scaling factor come into play for the higher frequency (>450 GHz) and long-baseline (>5km)
observations. These inherently have poorer phase stability and are taken in low PWV (<1mm) conditions
for which we find the scaling to be most effective. A promising explanation for the scaling factor
is the mixing of dry and wet air components, although other origins are discussed. We have produced
a python code to allow ALMA users to undertake WVR scaling tests and make improvements to their data.
