We investigate the properties of galaxies as they shut off star formation over the 4 billion years
surrounding peak cosmic star formation. To do this we categorize $\sim7000$ galaxies from $1<z<4$
into $90$ groups based on the shape of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and build composite
SEDs with $R\sim 50$ resolution. These composite SEDs show a variety of spectral shapes and also
show trends in parameters such as color, mass, star formation rate, and emission line equivalent
width. Using emission line equivalent widths and strength of the 4000\AA\ break, $D(4000)$, we
categorize the composite SEDs into five classes: extreme emission line, star-forming, transitioning,
post-starburst, and quiescent galaxies. The transitioning population of galaxies show modest
H$\alpha$ emission ($EW_{\rm REST}\sim40$\AA) compared to more typical star-forming composite
SEDs at $\log_{10}(M/M_\odot)\sim10.5$ ($EW_{\rm REST}\sim80$\AA). Together with their smaller
sizes (3 kpc vs. 4 kpc) and higher S\'ersic indices (2.7 vs. 1.5), this indicates that morphological
changes initiate before the cessation of star formation. The transitional group shows a strong
increase of over one dex in number density from $z\sim3$ to $z\sim1$, similar to the growth in the
quiescent population, while post-starburst galaxies become rarer at $z\lesssim1.5$. We calculate
average quenching timescales of 1.6 Gyr at $z\sim1.5$ and 0.9 Gyr at $z\sim2.5$ and conclude that
a fast quenching mechanism producing post-starbursts dominated the quenching of galaxies at early
times, while a slower process has become more common since $z\sim2$.
