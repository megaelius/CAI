Separators, which are in many ways the three-dimensional equivalent to two-dimensional nulls,
are important sites for magnetic reconnection. Magnetic reconnection occurs in strong current
layers which have very short length scales. The aim of this work is to explore the nature of current
layers around separators. A separator is a special field line which lies along the intersection
of two separatrix surfaces and forms the boundary between four topologically distinct flux domains.
In particular, here the current layer about a separator that joins two 3D nulls and lies along the
intersection of their separatrix surfaces is investigated. A magnetic configuration containing
a single separator embedded in a uniform plasma with a uniform electric current parallel to the separator
is considered. This initial magnetic setup, which is not in equilibrium, relaxes in a non-resistive
manner to form an equilibrium. The relaxation is achieved using the 3D MHD code, Lare3d, with resistivity
set to zero. A series of experiments with varying initial current are run to investigate the characteristics
of the resulting current layers present in the final (quasi-) equilibrium states. In each experiment,
the separator collapses and a current layer forms along it. The dimensions and strength of the current
layer increase with initial current. It is found that separator current layers formed from current
parallel to the separator are twisted. Also the collapse of the separator is a process that evolves
like an infinite-time singularity where the length, width and peak current in the layer grow slowly
whilst the depth of the current layer decreases.
