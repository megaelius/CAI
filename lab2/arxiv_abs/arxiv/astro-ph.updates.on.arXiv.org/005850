Recent analyses suggest that distance residuals measured from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are correlated
with local host galaxy properties within a few kpc of the SN explosion. However, the well-established
correlation with the global properties of the host galaxy is nearly as significant, with a shift
of 0.06 mag across a low to high mass boundary (the mass step). Here, we investigate whether the stellar
masses and rest-frame $u - g$ colors of regions within 1.5 kpc of the SN Ia explosion site are significantly
better correlated with SN distance measurements than global properties or properties measured
at random locations in SN hosts. With the Foundation and Pantheon datasets, we measure host properties
using 271 SNe Ia at $z < 0.1$. At $\lesssim 2 \sigma$ significance, local properties tend to correlate
with distance residuals better than properties at random locations, though despite using the largest
low-$z$ sample to date we cannot definitively prove that a local correlation is more significant
than a random correlation. At the 2.1$\sigma$ level our data also hint that SNe observed by surveys
that do not target a pre-selected set of galaxies may have a larger local mass step than SNe from surveys
that do, an increase of $0.070 \pm 0.034$ mag. We find some evidence that the correlation of galaxy
properties with Hubble residuals is stronger for SNe where both local and global indicators agree,
yielding a combined host mass step of $0.099 \pm 0.026$ mag. After correcting for the global mass
step, we find that only the local mass step remains significant at $> 2 \sigma$ and we conservatively
estimate a systematic shift in H$_0$ measurements of -0.13 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with an additional
uncertainty of 0.13 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $\sim$10% of the present uncertainty.
