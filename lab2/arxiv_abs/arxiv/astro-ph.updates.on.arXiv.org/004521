We investigate the effect of Fe II equivalent width ($W_{2600}$) and fibre size on the average luminosity
of [O II]$\lambda\lambda$3727,3729 nebular emission associated with Mg II absorbers (at $0.55
\le z \le 1.3$) in the composite spectra of quasars obtained with 3 and 2 arcsec fibres in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. We confirm the presence of strong correlations between [O II] luminosity (L$_{[\rm
O~II]}$) and equivalent width ($W_{2796}$) and redshift of Mg II absorbers. However, we show L$_{[\rm
O~II]}$ and average luminosity surface density suffers from fibre size effects. More importantly,
for a given fibre size the average L$_{[\rm O~II]}$ strongly depends on the equivalent width of Fe
II absorption lines and found to be higher for Mg II absorbers with $R \equiv$ $W_{\rm 2600}/W_{\rm
2796}$ $\ge 0.5$. In fact, we show the observed strong correlations of L$_{[\rm O~II]}$ with $W_{2796}$
and $z$ of Mg II absorbers are mainly driven by such systems. Direct [O II] detections also confirm
the link between L$_{[\rm O~II]}$ and $R$. Therefore, one has to pay attention to the fibre losses
and dependence of redshift evolution of Mg II absorbers on $W_{2600}$ before using them as a luminosity
unbiased probe of global star formation rate density. We show that the [O II] nebular emission detected
in the stacked spectrum is not dominated by few direct detections (i.e., detections $\ge 3 \sigma$
significant level). On an average the systems with $R$ $\ge 0.5$ and $W_{2796}$ $\ge 2$ \AA\ are more
reddened, showing colour excess E($B-V$) $\sim$ 0.02, with respect to the systems with $R$ $< 0.5$
and most likely traces the high H I column density systems.
