We present the novel wide & deep neural network GalaxyNet, which connects the properties of galaxies
and dark matter haloes, and is directly trained on observed galaxy statistics using reinforcement
learning. The most important halo properties to predict stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR)
are halo mass, growth rate, and scale factor at the time the mass peaks, which results from a feature
importance analysis with random forests. We train different models with supervised learning to
find the optimal network architecture. GalaxyNet is then trained with a reinforcement learning
approach: for a fixed set of weights and biases, we compute the galaxy properties for all haloes and
then derive mock statistics (stellar mass functions, cosmic and specific SFRs, quenched fractions,
and clustering). Comparing these statistics to observations we get the model loss, which is minimised
with particle swarm optimisation. GalaxyNet reproduces the observed data very accurately ($\chi_\mathrm{red}=1.05$),
and predicts a stellar-to-halo mass relation with a lower normalisation and shallower low-mass
slope at high redshift than empirical models. We find that at low mass, the galaxies with the highest
SFRs are satellites, although most satellites are quenched. The normalisation of the instantaneous
conversion efficiency increases with redshift, but stays constant above $z\gtrsim0.7$. Finally,
we use GalaxyNet to populate a cosmic volume of $(5.9~\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ with galaxies and predict
the BAO signal, the bias, and the clustering of active and passive galaxies up to $z=4$, which can
be tested with next-generation surveys, such as LSST and Euclid.
