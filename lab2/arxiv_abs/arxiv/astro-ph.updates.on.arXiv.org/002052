We perform the first comprehensive analysis of the prospects for direct detection of dark matter
with future ton-scale detectors in the general 11-dimensional effective theory of isoscalar dark
matter-nucleon interactions mediated by a heavy spin-1 or spin-0 particle. The theory includes
8 momentum and velocity dependent dark matter-nucleon interaction operators, besides the familiar
spin-independent and spin-dependent operators. From a variegated sample of 27 benchmark points
selected in the parameter space of the theory, we simulate independent sets of synthetic data for
ton-scale Germanium and Xenon detectors. From the synthetic data, we then extract the marginal
posterior probability density functions and the profile likelihoods of the model parameters.
The associated Bayesian credible regions and frequentist confidence intervals allow us to assess
the prospects for direct detection of dark matter at the 27 benchmark points. First, we analyze the
data assuming the knowledge of the correct dark matter nucleon-interaction type, as it is commonly
done for the familiar spin-independent and spin-dependent interactions. Then, we analyze the
simulations extracting the dark matter-nucleon interaction type from the data directly, in contrast
to standard analyses. This second approach requires an extensive exploration of the full 11-dimensional
parameter space of the dark matter-nucleon effective theory. Interestingly, we identify 5 scenarios
where the dark matter mass and the dark matter-nucleon interaction type can be reconstructed from
the data simultaneously. We stress the importance of extracting the dark matter nucleon-interaction
type from the data directly, discussing the main challenges found addressing this complex 11-dimensional
problem.
