We present ~1" resolution (~2 kpc in the source plane) observations of the CO(1-0), CO(3-2), Halpha,
and [N II] lines in the strongly-lensed z=2.26 star-forming galaxy SDSS J0901+1814. We use these
observations to constrain the lensing potential of a foreground group of galaxies, and our source-plane
reconstructions indicate that SDSS J0901+1814 is a nearly face-on (i~30 degrees) massive disk
with r_{1/2}>~4 kpc for its molecular gas. Using our new magnification factors (mu_tot~30), we
find that SDSS J0901+1814 has a star formation rate (SFR) of 268^{+63}_{-61} M_sun/yr, M_gas=(1.6^{+0.3}_{-0.2})x10^11x(alpha_CO/4.6)
M_sun, and M_star=(9.5^{+3.8}_{-2.8})x10^10 M_sun, which places it on the star-forming galaxy
"main sequence." We use our matched high-angular resolution gas and SFR tracers (CO and Halpha,
respectively) to perform a spatially resolved (pixel-by-pixel) analysis of SDSS J0901+1814 in
terms of the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation. After correcting for the large fraction of obscured star
formation (SFR_Halpha/SFR_TIR=0.054^{+0.015}_{-0.014}), we find SDSS J0901+1814 is offset
from "normal" star-forming galaxies to higher star formation efficiencies independent of assumptions
for the CO-to-H_2 conversion factor. Our mean best-fit index for the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation
for SDSS J0901+1814, evaluated with different CO lines and smoothing levels, is n=1.54+/-0.13;
however, the index may be affected by gravitational lensing, and we find n=1.24+/-0.02 when analyzing
the source-plane reconstructions. While the Schmidt-Kennicutt index largely appears unaffected
by which of the two CO transitions we use to trace the molecular gas, the source-plane reconstructions
and dynamical modeling suggest that the CO(1-0) emission is more spatially extended than the CO(3-2)
emission.
