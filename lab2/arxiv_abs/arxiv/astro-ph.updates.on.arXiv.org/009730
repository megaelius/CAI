The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will offer the first opportunity to characterize terrestrial
exoplanets with sufficient precision to identify high mean molecular weight atmospheres, and
TRAPPIST-1's seven known transiting Earth-sized planets are particularly favorable targets.
To assist community preparations for JWST, we use simulations of plausible post-ocean-loss and
habitable environments for the TRAPPIST-1 exoplanets, and test simulations of all bright object
time series spectroscopy modes and all MIRI photometry filters to determine optimal observing
strategies for atmospheric detection and characterization using both transmission and emission
observations. We find that transmission spectroscopy with NIRSpec Prism is optimal for detecting
terrestrial, CO2 containing atmospheres, potentially in fewer than 10 transits for all seven TRAPPIST-1
planets, if they lack high altitude aerosols. If the TRAPPIST-1 planets possess Venus-like H2SO4
aerosols, up to 12 times more transits may be required to detect atmospheres. We present optimal
instruments and observing modes for the detection of individual molecular species in a given terrestrial
atmosphere and an observational strategy for discriminating between evolutionary states. We
find that water may be prohibitively difficult to detect in both Venus-like and habitable atmospheres
due to its presence lower in the atmosphere where transmission spectra are less sensitive. Although
the presence of biogenic O2 and O3 will be extremely challenging to detect, abiotically produced
oxygen from past ocean loss may be detectable for all seven TRAPPIST-1 planets via O2-O2 collisionally-induced
absorption at 1.06 and 1.27 microns, or via NIR O3 features for the outer three planets. Our results
constitute a suite of hypotheses on the nature and detectability of highly-evolved terrestrial
exoplanet atmospheres that may be tested with JWST.
