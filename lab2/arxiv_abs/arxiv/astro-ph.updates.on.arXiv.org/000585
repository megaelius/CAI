We aim to detect the magnetic field and infer its properties around four AGB stars using H$_2$O maser
observations. The sample we observed consists of the following sources: the semi-regular variable
RT Vir and the Mira variables AP Lyn, IK Tau, and IRC+60370. We observed the 6$_{1,6}-5_{2,3}$ H$_2$O
maser rotational transition, in full-polarization mode, to determine its linear and circular
polarization. Based on the Zeeman effect, one can infer the properties of the magnetic field from
the maser polarization analysis. We detected a total of 238 maser features, in three of the four observed
sources. No masers were found toward AP Lyn. The observed masers are all located between 2.4 and 53.0
AU from the stars. Linear and circular polarization was found in 18 and 11 maser features, respectively.
We more than doubled the number of AGB stars in which magnetic field has been detected from H$_2$O
maser polarization, as our results confirm the presence of fields around IK Tau, RT Vir and IRC+60370.
The strength of the field along the line of sight is found to be between 47 and 331 mG in the H$_2$O maser
region. Extrapolating this result to the surface of the stars, assuming a toroidal field ($\propto$
r$^{-1}$), we find magnetic fields of 0.3-6.9 G on the stellar surfaces. If, instead of a toroidal
field, we assume a poloidal field ($\propto$ r$^{-2}$), then the extrapolated magnetic field strength
on the stellar surfaces are in the range between 2.2 and $\sim$115 G. Finally, if a dipole field ($\propto$
r$^{-3}$) is assumed, the field strength on the surface of the star is found to be between 15.8 and
$\sim$1945 G. The magnetic energy of our sources is higher than the thermal and kinetic energy in
the H$_2$O maser region of this class of objects. This leads us to conclude that, indeed, magnetic
fields probably play an important role in shaping the outflows of evolved stars. (abridged)
