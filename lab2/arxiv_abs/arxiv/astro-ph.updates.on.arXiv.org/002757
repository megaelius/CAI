The nature of black hole jets at the lowest detectable luminosities remains an open question, largely
due to a dearth of observational constraints. Here, we present a new, nearly-simultaneous broadband
spectrum of the black hole X-ray binary (BHXB) XTE J1118+480 at an extremely low Eddington ratio
(L_x~1e-8.5 L_Edd). Our new spectral energy distribution (SED) includes the radio, near-infrared,
optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray wavebands. XTE J1118 is now the second BHXB at such a low Eddington
ratio with a well-sampled SED, providing new constraints on highly sub-Eddington accretion flows
and jets, and opening the door for comparison studies. We apply a multi-zone jet model to the new broadband
SED, and we compare our results to previous fits to the same source using the same model at 4-5 decades
higher luminosity. We find that after a BHXB transitions to the so-called quiescent spectral state,
the jet base becomes more compact (by up to an order of magnitude) and slightly cooler (by at least
a factor of two). Our preferred model fit indicates that jet particle acceleration is weaker after
the transition into quiescence. That is, accelerated non-thermal particles no longer reach high
enough Lorentz factors to contribute significant amounts of synchrotron X-ray emission. Instead,
the X-ray waveband is dominated by synchrotron self-Compton emission from a population of mildly
relativistic electrons with a quasi-thermal velocity distribution associated with the jet base.
The corresponding (thermal) synchrotron component emits primarily in the infrared through ultraviolet
wavebands. Our results on XTE J1118 are consistent with broadband modeling for A0620-00 and for
Sgr A*. The above could therefore represent a canonical baseline geometry for accreting black holes
in quiescence. We conclude with suggestions for future studies to further investigate the above
scenario.
