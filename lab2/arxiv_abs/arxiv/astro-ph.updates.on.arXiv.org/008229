We use ten different galaxy formation scenarios from the EAGLE suite of {\Lambda}CDM hydrodynamical
simulations to assess the impact of feedback mechanisms in galaxy formation and compare these to
observed strong gravitational lenses. To compare observations with simulations, we create strong
lenses with $M_\star$ > $10^{11}$ $M_\odot$ with the appropriate resolution and noise level, and
model them with an elliptical power-law mass model to constrain their total mass density slope.
We also obtain the mass-size relation of the simulated lens-galaxy sample. We find significant
variation in the total mass density slope at the Einstein radius and in the projected stellar mass-size
relation, mainly due to different implementations of stellar and AGN feedback. We find that for
lens selected galaxies, models with either too weak or too strong stellar and/or AGN feedback fail
to explain the distribution of observed mass-density slopes, with the counter-intuitive trend
that increasing the feedback steepens the mass density slope around the Einstein radius ($\approx$
3-10 kpc). Models in which stellar feedback becomes inefficient at high gas densities, or weaker
AGN feedback with a higher duty cycle, produce strong lenses with total mass density slopes close
to isothermal (i.e. -d log({\rho})/d log(r) $\approx$ 2.0) and slope distributions statistically
agreeing with observed strong lens galaxies in SLACS and BELLS. Agreement is only slightly worse
with the more heterogeneous SL2S lens galaxy sample. Observations of strong-lens selected galaxies
thus appear to favor models with relatively weak feedback in massive galaxies.
