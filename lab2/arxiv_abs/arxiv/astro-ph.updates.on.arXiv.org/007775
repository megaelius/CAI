The 30 Dor C superbubble is unique for its synchrotron X-ray shell, as well as being the first superbubble
to be detected in TeV $\gamma$-rays, though the dominant TeV emission mechanism, i.e., leptonic
or hadronic, is still unclear. We aim to use new Chandra observations of 30 Dor C to resolve the synchrotron
shell in unprecedented detail and to estimate the magnetic ($B$) field in the postshock region,
a key discriminator between TeV $\gamma$-ray emission mechanisms. We extracted radial profiles
in the 1.5-8 keV range from various sectors around the synchrotron shell and fitted these with a projected
and point spread function convolved postshock volumetric emissivity model to determine the filament
widths. We then calculated the postshock magnetic field strength from these widths. We found that
most of the sectors were well fitted with our postshock model and the determined $B$-field values
were low, all with best fits $\lesssim 20~\mu$G. Upper limits on the confidence intervals of three
sectors reached $\gtrsim 30~\mu$G though these were poorly constrained. The generally low $B$-field
values suggests a leptonic-dominated origin for the TeV $\gamma$-rays. Our postshock model did
not provide adequate fits to two sectors. We found that one sector simply did not provide a clean enough
radial profile, while the other could be fitted with a modified model where the projected profile
falls off abruptly below $\sim0.8$ times the shell radius, yielding a postshock $B$-field of 4.8
(3.7-11.8) $\mu$G which is again consistent with the leptonic TeV $\gamma$-ray mechanism. Alternatively,
the observed profiles in these sectors could result from enhancements around a shock-cloud interaction
as suggested in previous works. The average $B$-field determined around the X-ray synchrotron
shell of 30 Dor C suggests the leptonic scenario as the dominant emission mechanism for the TeV $\gamma$-rays.
