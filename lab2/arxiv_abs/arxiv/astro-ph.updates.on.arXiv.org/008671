We present results from a large set of N-body/SPH hydrodynamical cluster simulations aimed at studying
the statistical properties of turbulence in the ICM. The numerical hydrodynamical scheme employs
a SPH formulation in which gradient errors are strongly reduced by using an integral approach. We
consider both adiabatic and radiative simulations. We construct clusters subsamples according
to the cluster dynamical status or gas physical modeling, from which we extract small-scale turbulent
velocities obtained by applying to cluster velocities different multiscale filtering methods.
The velocity power spectra of non-radiative relaxed clusters are mostly solenoidal and steeper
than Kologmorov. Cooling runs are distinguished by much shallower spectra, a feature which we interpret
as the injection of turbulence at small scales due to the interaction of compact cool gas cores with
the ICM. Turbulence in galaxy clusters is then characterized by multiple injection scales, with
the small scale driving source acting in addition to the large scale injection mechanisms. Cooling
runs of relaxed clusters exhibit enstrophy profiles with a power-law behavior over more than two
decades in radius, and a turbulent-to-thermal energy ratio ~1 %. In accord with Hitomi observations,
in the core of a highly relaxed cluster we find low level of gas motions. In addition, the estimated
cluster radial profile of the sloshing oscillation period exhibits an associated Froude number
satisfying Fr ~ 0.1 within r / r_{200} <~ 0.1. Our findings suggest that in cluster cores ICM turbulence
approaches a stratified anisotropic regime, with weak stirring motions dominated by gravity buoyancy
forces and strongly suppressed along the radial direction. We conclude that turbulent heating
cannot be considered the main heating source in cluster cores.
