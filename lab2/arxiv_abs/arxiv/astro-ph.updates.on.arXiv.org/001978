The aim of the project is to find the stars nearest to the Sun and to contribute to the completion of
the stellar and substellar census of the solar neighbourhood. We identified a new late-M dwarf within
5 pc, looking for high proper motion sources in the 2MASS-WISE cross-match. We collected astrometric
and photometric data available from public large-scale surveys. We complemented this information
with low-resolution optical and near-infrared spectroscopy with instrumentation on the ESO NTT
to confirm the nature of our candidate. We also present a high-quality medium-resolution VLT/X-shooter
spectrum covering the 400 to 2500 nm wavelength range. We classify this new neighbour as an M7.0$\pm$0.5
dwarf using spectral templates from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and spectral indices. Lithium
absorption at 670.8 nm is not detected in the X-shooter spectrum, indicating that the M7 dwarf is
older than 600 Myr and more massive than 0.06 M$_{\odot}$. We also derive a trigonometric distance
of 4.4 pc, in agreement with the spectroscopic distance estimate, making 2MASS\,J154043.42$-$510135.7
the nearest M7 dwarf to the Sun. This trigonometric distance is somewhat closer than the $\sim$6
pc distance reported by the ALLWISE team, who independently identified this object recently. This
discovery represents an increase of 25\% in the number of M7--M8 dwarfs already known at distances
closer than 8\,pc from our Sun. We derive a density of $\rho$\,=\,1.9$\pm$0.9$\times$10$^{-3}$\,pc$^{-3}$
for M7 dwarfs in the 8 pc volume, a value similar to those quoted in the literature. This new ultracool
dwarf is among the 50 nearest systems to the Sun, demonstrating that our current knowledge of the
stellar census within the 5 pc sample remains incomplete. 2M1540 represents a unique opportunity
to search for extrasolar planets around ultracool dwarfs due to its proximity and brightness.
