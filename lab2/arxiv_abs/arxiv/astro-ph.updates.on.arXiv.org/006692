The spectral flux density of stars can indicate their atmospheric physical properties. A detector
can obtain any band flux density at the design stage. However, the band flux density is confirmed
and fixed in the process of operation because of the restriction of filters. Other band flux densities
cannot be obtained through the same detector. In this study, a computational model of stellar spectral
flux density is established based on basic physical parameters which are effective temperature
and angular parameter. The stochastic particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to address
this issue with appropriately chosen values of the algorithm parameters. Four star catalogues
are studied and consist of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST),
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX), and Two Micron
All Sky Survey (2MASS). The given flux densities from catalogues are input parameters. Stellar
effective temperatures and angular parameters are inversed using the given flux densities according
to SPSO algorithm. Then the flux density is calculated according to Planck's law on the basis of stellar
effective temperatures and angular parameters. The calculated flux density is compared with the
given value from catalogues. It is found that the inversion results are in good agreement for all
bands of the MSX and 2MASS catalogues, whereas they do not agree well in some bands of the LAMOST and
WISE catalogues. Based on the results, data from the MSX and 2MASS catalogues can be used to calculate
the spectral flux density at different wavelengths of given wavelength ranges. The stellar flux
density is obtained and can provide data support and an effective reference for detection and recognition
of stars.
