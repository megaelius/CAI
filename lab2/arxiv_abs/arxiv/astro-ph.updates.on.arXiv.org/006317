High redshift quasars emit copious X-ray photons which heat the intergalactic medium to temperatures
up to $\sim$ 10$^6$ K. At such high temperatures the primordial gas will not form stars until it is
assembled into dark matter haloes with masses of $\sim$ 10$^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$, at which point the
hot gas collapses and cools under the influence of gravity. Once this occurs, there is a massive reservoir
of primordial gas from which stars can form, potentially setting the stage for the brightest Population
(Pop) III starbursts in the early Universe. Supporting this scenario, recent observations of quasars
at z $\sim$ 6 have revealed a lack of accompanying Lyman $\alpha$ emitting galaxies, consistent
with suppression of primordial star formation in haloes with masses below $\sim$ 10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$.
Here we model the chemical and thermal evolution of the primordial gas as it collapses into such a
massive halo irradiated by a nearby quasar in the run-up to a massive Pop III starburst. We show that
at distances of $\sim$ 1 Mpc from a typical quasar the conditions are prime for HD cooling to play a
role in the evolution of the gas, possibly resulting in a shift to a lower characteristic stellar
mass. Within $\sim$ 100 kpc of the highest redshift quasars discovered to date the Lyman-Werner
flux produced by the stars in the quasar host galaxy may be high enough to stimulate the formation
of a direct collapse black hole (DCBH). Given that metal-enriched outflows are expected to extend
out to only $\simeq$ 50 kpc from high-z quasars, this suggests that there is ample unpolluted primordial
gas for the formation of DCBHs and Pop III starbursts. How frequently these objects form can be constrained
with the James Webb Space Telescope in the coming years.
