The circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way is mostly obscured by nearby gas in position-velocity
space due to the location and motion of observers inside the Galaxy. While most studies on the Milky
Way's CGM to date focus on easier-to-detect high-velocity gas ($|v_{\rm LSR}|\gtrsim100$ km s$^{-1}$),
it only partially represents the entire CGM, resulting in substantial biases. Here we investigate
four observational biases inherent in the studies of the Milky Way's CGM with mock observations
on a Milky-Way analog from the FOGGIE simulations. With a mock observer placed inside the simulated
galaxy at off-center locations consistent with that of the Sun, we find that: (i) high-velocity-based
studies could miss $\sim$2/3 of the Milky Way's CGM mass; (ii) once we correct velocities from the
local standard of rest to the galaxy's rest frame, gas infall rate ($\dot{M}$) for cold gas observable
in HI 21cm emission is reduced from -0.25 M$_\odot$ to -0.05 M$_\odot$, while $\dot{M}$ for gases
at warmer phases are less affected; (iii) OVI and NV are likely to be good UV tracers of the Milky Way's
outer CGM ($r\gtrsim$15 kpc), whereas CIV maybe less sensitive; (iv) because of the clumpiness
and radial distribution of CGM gas, the scatter in ionic column densities is a factor of 2 higher when
the CGM is observed from the inside-out versus from external views. Our work highlights that observations
of the Milky Way's CGM, especially those using HI emission and UV absorption lines, are highly biased
because we reside inside the Galaxy. We demonstrate that these biases can be quantified and calibrated
through synthetic observations with simulated Milky-Way analogs.
