Strong gravitational lenses can be used to detect low mass subhalos, based on deviations in image
fluxes and positions from what can be achieved with a smooth mass distribution. So far, this method
has been limited by the small number of (radio-loud, microlensing free) systems which can be analysed
for the presence of substructure. Using the gravitational lens B1422+231, we demonstrate that
adaptive optics integral field spectroscopy can also be used to detect dark substructures. We analyse
data obtained with OSIRIS on the Keck I Telescope, using a Bayesian method that accounts for uncertainties
relating to the point spread function and image positions in the separate exposures. The narrow-line
[OIII] fluxes measured for the lensed images are consistent with those measured in the radio, and
show a significant deviation from what would be expected in a smooth mass distribution, consistent
with the presence of a perturbing low mass halo. Detailed lens modelling shows that image fluxes
and positions are fit significantly better when the lens is modelled as a system containing a single
perturbing subhalo in addition to the main halo, rather than by the main halo on its own, indicating
the significant detection of substructure.The inferred mass of the subhalo depends on the subhalo
mass density profile: the 68% confidence interval for the perturber mass within 600 pc are: 8.2$^{+0.6}_{-0.8}$,
8.2$^{+0.6}_{-1}$ and 7.6$\pm0.3$ $\log_{10}$[M$_{\rm{sub}}$/M$_\odot$] respectively for
a singular isothermal sphere, a pseudo-Jaffe, and an NFW mass profile. This method can extend the
study of flux ratio anomalies to virtually all quadruply imaged quasars, and therefore offers great
potential to improve the determination of the subhalo mass function in the near future.
