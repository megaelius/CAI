The precise determination of carbon abundances, together with N and O, is a key ingredient to understanding
different phases of stellar evolution. We aim at enabling a reliable carbon spectroscopy for our
unified NLTE atmosphere code FASTWIND. We develop a new carbon model atom including CII/III/IV/V,
and discuss specific problems related to carbon spectroscopy in O-type stars. By comparing with
high-resolution spectra from six O-type stars, we check in how far observational constraints can
be reproduced by our new carbon line synthesis. Carbon lines are even more sensitive to a variation
of effective temperature, gravity, and mass loss rate, than hydrogen/helium lines. We are able
to reproduce most of the observed lines from our stellar sample, and to estimate those specific carbon
abundances which bring the lines from different ions into agreement. For hot dwarfs and supergiants
earlier than O7, X-rays from wind-embedded shocks can have an impact on the synthesized line strengths,
particularly for CIV, potentially affecting the abundance determination. Dielectronic recombination
has a significant impact on the ionization balance in the wind. We have demonstrated our capability
to derive realistic carbon abundances by means of FASTWIND, using our recently developed model
atom. We found that complex effects can have a strong influence on the carbon ionization balance
in hot stars. For a further understanding, the UV range needs to be explored as well. By means of detailed
nitrogen and oxygen model atoms available to use, we will be able to perform a complete CNO abundance
analysis for larger samples of massive stars, and to provide constraints on corresponding evolutionary
models and aspects.
