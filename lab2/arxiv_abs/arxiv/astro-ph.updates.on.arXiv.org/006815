We study the hydrodynamics and nucleosynthesis in the double-detonation model of Type Ia supernovae
(SNe~Ia) and the interaction between the ejecta and a surviving white dwarf (WD) companion in the
double-degenerate scenario. We perform smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation coupled
with nuclear reaction networks. We set up a binary star system with $1.0M_\odot$ and $0.6M_\odot$
carbon-oxygen (CO) WDs, where the primary WD consists of a CO core and helium (He) shell with $0.95$
and $0.05M_\odot$, respectively. We follow the evolution of the binary star system from the initiation
of a He detonation, ignition and propagation of a CO detonation, and the interaction of SN ejecta
with the companion WD. The companion (or surviving) WD gets a flung-away velocity of $\sim 1700$~km~s$^{-1}$,
and captures $^{56}$Ni of $\sim 0.02M_\odot$, and He of $3 \times 10^{-4}M_\odot$. Such $^{56}$Ni
and its decay products may not be observed due to sedimentation, while such He can be detected on the
surface of surviving WDs. The SN ejecta contains a "companion-origin stream", and unburned materials
stripped from the companion WD ($\sim 3 \cdot 10^{-3}M_\odot$). The ejecta has also a velocity shift
of $\sim 1000$~km~s$^{-1}$ due to the binary motion of the exploding primary WD. These features
would be prominent in nebular-phase spectra of oxygen emission lines from the unburned materials
like SN~2010lp and iPTF14atg, and of blue- or red-shifted Fe-group emission lines from the velocity
shift like a part of sub-luminous SNe~Ia. We expect SN~Ia counterparts to the D$^6$ model would leave
these fingerprints for SN~Ia observations.
