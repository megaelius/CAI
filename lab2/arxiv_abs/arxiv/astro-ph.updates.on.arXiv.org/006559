We use the deuteration of $c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}H_{2}}$ to probe the physical parameters of starless
and protostellar cores, related to their evolutionary states, and compare it to the $\mathrm{N_{2}H^{+}}$-deuteration
in order to study possible differences between the deuteration of C- and N-bearing species. We observed
the main species $c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}H_{2}}$, the singly and doubly deuterated species $c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}HD}$
and $c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}D_{2}}$, as well as the isotopologue $c$-$\mathrm{{H^{13}CC_{2}H}}$
toward 10 starless cores and 5 protostars in the Taurus and Perseus Complexes. We examined the correlation
between the $N$($c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}HD}$)/$N$($c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}H_{2}}$) ratio and the dust
temperature along with the $\mathrm{H_2}$ column density and the CO depletion factor. The resulting
$N$($c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}HD}$)/$N$($c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}H_{2}}$) ratio is within the error bars
consistent with $10\%$ in all starless cores with detected $c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}HD}$. This also
accounts for the protostars except for the source HH211, where we measure a high deuteration level
of $23\%$. The deuteration of $\mathrm{N_{2}H^{+}}$ follows the same trend but is considerably
higher in the dynamically evolved core L1544. Toward the protostellar cores the coolest objects
show the largest deuterium fraction in $c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}H_{2}}$. We show that the deuteration
of $c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}H_{2}}$ can trace the early phases of star formation and is comparable to
that of $\mathrm{N_{2}H^{+}}$. However, the largest $c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}H_{2}}$ deuteration
level is found toward protostellar cores, suggesting that while $c$-$\mathrm{C_{3}H_{2}}$ is
mainly frozen onto dust grains in the central regions of starless cores, active deuteration is taking
place on ice.
