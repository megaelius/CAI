We study stellar property statistics, including satellite galaxy occupation, of massive halo
populations realized by three cosmological hydrodynamics simulations: BAHAMAS + MACSIS, TNG300
of the IllustrisTNG suite, and Magneticum Pathfinder. The simulations incorporate independent
sub-grid methods for astrophysical processes with spatial resolutions ranging from $1.5$ to $6$
kpc, and each generates samples of $1000$ or more halos with $M_{\rm halo}> 10^{13.5} M_{\odot}$
at redshift $z=0$. Applying localized, linear regression (LLR), we extract halo mass-conditioned
statistics (normalizations, slopes, and intrinsic covariance) for a three-element stellar property
vector consisting of: i) $N_{sat}$, the number of satellite galaxies with stellar mass, $M_{\star,
\rm sat} > 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ within radius $R_{200c}$ of the halo; ii) $M_{\star,\rm tot}$, the
total stellar mass within that radius, and; iii) $M_{\star,\rm BCG}$, the gravitationally-bound
stellar mass of the central galaxy within a $100 \, \rm kpc$ radius. Scaling parameters for the three
properties with halo mass show mild differences among the simulations, in part due to numerical
resolution, but there is qualitative agreement on property correlations, with halos having smaller
than average central galaxies tending to also have smaller total stellar mass and a larger number
of satellite galaxies. Marginalizing over total halo mass, we find the satellite galaxy kernel,
$p(\ln N_{sat}\,|\,M_{\rm halo},z)$ to be consistently skewed left, with skewness parameter
$\gamma = -0.91 \pm 0.02$, while that of $\ln M_{\star,\rm tot}$ is closer to log-normal, in all three
simulations. The highest resolution simulations find $\gamma \simeq -0.8$ for the $z=0$ shape
of $p(\ln M_{\star,\rm BCG}\,|\,M_{\rm halo},z)$ and also that the fractional scatter in total
stellar mass is below $10\%$ in halos more massive than $10^{14.3} M_{\odot}$.
