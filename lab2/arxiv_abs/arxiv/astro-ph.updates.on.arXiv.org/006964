We present a multi-frequency, dense radio monitoring program of the blazar OJ287 using the 100m
Effelsberg radio telescope. We analyze the evolution in total flux density, linear and circular
polarization to study the jet structure and its magnetic field geometry. The total flux density
is measured at nine bands from 2.64 GHz to 43 GHz, the linear polarization parameters between 2.64
GHz and 10.45 GHz, and the circular polarization at 4.85 GHz and 8.35 GHz. The mean cadence is 10 days.
Between MJD 57370 and 57785, OJ287 showed flaring activity and complex linear and circular polarization
behavior. The radio EVPA showed a large clockwise (CW) rotation by ~340$^{\circ}$ with a mean rate
of -1.04 $^{\circ}$/day. Based on concurrent VLBI data, the rotation seems to originate within
the jet core at 43 GHz (projected size $\le$ 0.15 mas or 0.67 pc). Moreover, optical data show a similar
monotonic CW EVPA rotation with a rate of about -1.1 $^{\circ}$/day which is superposed with shorter
and faster rotations of about 7.8 $^{\circ}$/day. The observed variability is consistent with
a polarized emission component propagating on a helical trajectory within a bent jet. We constrained
the helix arc length to 0.26 pc and radius to $\le$ 0.04 pc as well as the jet bending arc length projected
on the plane of the sky to $\le$ 1.9-7.6 pc. A similar bending is observed in high angular resolution
VLBI images at the innermost jet regions. Our results indicate also the presence of a stable polarized
emission component with EVPA (-10$^{\circ}$) perpendicular to the large scale jet, suggesting
dominance of the poloidal magnetic field component. Finally, the EVPA rotation begins simultaneously
with an optical flare and hence the two might be physically connected. That optical flare has been
linked to the interaction of a secondary SMBH with the inner accretion disk or originating in the
jet of the primary.
