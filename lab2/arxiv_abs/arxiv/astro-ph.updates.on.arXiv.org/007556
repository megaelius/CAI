We present a reformulation of axion modified electrodynamics with a similar form to unmodified
Maxwell's equations, with modifications redefined within the constitutive relations between
the $\vec{D}$, $\vec{H}$, $\vec{B}$ and $\vec{E}$ fields. The axion induced bound charge density,
polarization current density and bound current density are identified along with the associated
axion induced vacuum polarization and magnetization, which are shown to satisfy the charge-current
continuity equation. The reformulation is important when considering conversions of axions into
photons, relevant in many experimental contexts. For example, when a DC $\vec{B}$-field is applied,
oscillating bound vacuum charges and polarization currents are induced at a frequency equivalent
to the axion mass. In contrast, when a large DC $\vec{E}$ field is applied, an oscillating bound current
or magnetization of the vacuum is induced at a frequency equivalent to the axion mass. Furthermore,
the integral forms of the equations can be used to clearly define the boundary conditions between
distinct media either with or without axion induced vacuum polarization or magnetization. This
provides clarity when considering experiments sensitive to axion induced electric and/or magnetic
effects inside or outside the high DC field region. Moreover, we show how the axion induced oscillating
polarization under a DC magnetic field is analogous to a permanent polarised electret oscillating
at the frequency of the axion's Compton mass. The effective oscillating electret sources an electromotive
force as a modification to the Lorentz Force acting on free electrons in a conductor and bound electrons
in a dielectric. This means that electric sensing techniques that utilize conductors and capacitors
in a high DC magnetic field can act as sensitive low-mass axion detectors without suppression of
the signal due to shielding.
