We present a series of dynamical maps for fictitious 3-planets systems in initially circular coplanar
orbits. These maps have unveiled a rich resonant structure involving two or three planets, as well
as indicating possible migration routes from secular to double resonances or pure 3-planet commensurabilities.
These structures are then compared to the present-day orbital architecture of observed resonant
chains. In a second part of the paper we describe N-body simulations of type-I migration. Depending
on the orbital decay timescale, we show that 3-planet systems may be trapped in different combinations
of independent commensurabilities: (i) double resonances, (ii) intersection between a 2-planet
and a first-order 3-planet resonance, and (iii) simultaneous libration in two first-order 3-planet
resonances. These latter outcomes are found for slow migrations, while double resonances are almost
always the final outcome in high-density disks. Finally, we discuss an application to the TRAPPIST-1
system. We find that, for low migration rates and planetary masses of the order of the estimated values,
most 3-planet sub-systems are able to reach the observed double resonances after following evolutionary
routes defined by pure 3-planet resonances. The final orbital configuration shows resonance offsets
comparable with present-day values without the need of tidal dissipation. For the 8/5 resonance
proposed to dominate the dynamics of the two inner planets, we find little evidence of its dynamical
significance; instead, we propose that this relation between mean motions could be a consequence
of the interaction between a pure 3-planet resonance and a 2-planet commensurability between planets
c and d.
