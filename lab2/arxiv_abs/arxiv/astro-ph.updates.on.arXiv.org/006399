The recent detection of the binary-neutron-star merger associated with GW170817 by both LIGO-Virgo
and the network of electromagnetic-spectrum observing facilities around the world has made the
multi-messenger detection of gravitational-wave events a reality. These joint detections allow
us to probe gravitational-wave sources in greater detail and provide us with the possibility of
confidently establishing events that would not have been detected in gravitational-wave data
alone. In this paper, we explore the prospects of using the electromagnetic follow-up of low-significance
gravitational-wave event candidates to increase the sample of confident detections with electromagnetic
counterparts. We find that the gravitational-wave alert threshold change that would roughly double
the number of detectable astrophysical events would increase the false-alarm rate by more than
5 orders of magnitude from 1 per 100 years to more than 1000 per year. We find that the localization
costs of following-up low-significance candidates are marginal, as the same changes to false-alarm
rate only increase distance/area localizations by less than a factor of 2 and increase volume localization
by less than a factor of 4. We argue that EM follow-up thresholds for low-significance candidates
should be set on the basis of alert purity ($P_\text{astro}$) and not false-alarm rate. Ideally,
such estimates of $P_\text{astro}$ would be provided by LIGO-Virgo, but in their absence we provide
estimates of the average purity of the gravitational-wave candidate alerts issued by LIGO-Virgo
as a function of false-alarm rate for various LIGO-Virgo observing epochs.
