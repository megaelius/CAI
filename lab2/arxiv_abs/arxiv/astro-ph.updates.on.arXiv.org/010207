The search for electromagnetic counterparts for gravitational waves events is one of the main topics
of multi-messenger Astrophysics. Among these searches is the one for high energy gamma-ray emission
with the H.E.S.S. Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes in Namibia. During their second Observation
Run O2, the Advanced Virgo detector in Italy and the two advanced LIGO detectors in Washington and
Louisiana while conducting joint observations, detected for the first time, on August $14^{th}$,
2017 a transient GW signal due to the coalescence of two stellar masses black holes, an event labeled
GW170814. The alert announcing the event was issued two hours later and H.E.S.S. observations could
be scheduled for the nights of $16^{th}$, $17^{th}$ and $18^{th}$ August 2017. Three days after
the binary BH merger, on August $17^{th}$, the coalescence of two neutron star was detected for the
first time, followed by a GRB detection by Fermi's GBM starting a new era in multi-messenger Astronomy.
Observations started 5.3 h after the merge and contained the counterpart SSS17a that was identified
several hours later. It stands as the first data obtained by a ground-based pointing instrument
on this object. In this contribution, we will present the results of the search of high-energy gamma
ray emission as electromagnetic counterpart of these two GW events. No significant gamma ray emission
was detected for either event. Nevertheless upper limit maps were derived constraining, for the
first time, the non-thermal, high-energy emission on the remnant of a three detector binary black
hole coalescence (GW170814), and a binary neutron star coalescence (GW170817).
