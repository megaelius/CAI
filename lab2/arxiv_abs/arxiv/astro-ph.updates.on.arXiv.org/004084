The evolution of protoplanetary discs embedded in stellar clusters depends on the age and the stellar
density in which they are embedded. Stellar clusters of young age and high stellar surface density
destroy protoplanetary discs by external photoevaporation and stellar encounters. Here we consider
the effect of background heating from newly formed stellar clusters on the structure of protoplanetary
discs and how it affects the formation of planets in these discs. Our planet formation model is build
on the core accretion scenario including pebble accretion. We synthesize planet populations that
we compare to observations. The giant planets in our simulations migrate over large distances due
to the fast type-II migration regime induced by a high disc viscosity ($\alpha=5.4 \times 10^{-3}$).
Cold Jupiters (r>1 AU) originate preferably from the outer disc, while hot Jupiters (r<0.1 AU) preferably
form in the inner disc. We find that the formation of gas giants via pebble accretion is in agreement
with the metallicity correlation, meaning that more gas giants are formed at larger metallicity.
However, our synthetic population of isolated stars host a significant amount of giant planets
even at low metallicity, in contradiction to observations where giant planets are preferably found
around high metallicity stars, indicating that pebble accretion is very efficient in the standard
pebble accretion framework. On the other hand, discs around stars embedded in cluster environments
hardly form any giant planets at low metallicity in agreement with observations, where these changes
originate from the increased temperature in the outer parts of the disc, which prolongs the core
accretion time-scale of the planet. We therefore conclude that the outer disc structure and the
planet's formation location determines the giant planet occurrence rate and the formation efficiency
of cold and hot Jupiters.
