An important question in solar physics is whether solar microflares, the smallest currently observable
flare events in X-rays, possess the same energetic properties as large flares. Recent surveys have
suggested that microflares may be less efficient particle accelerators than large flares, and
hence contribute less nonthermal energy, which may have implications for coronal heating mechanisms.
We therefore explore the energetic properties of microflares by combining Extreme Ultraviolet
(EUV) and X-ray measurements. We present forward-fitting differential emission measure (DEM)
analysis of 10 microflares. The fitting is constrained by combining, for the first time, high temperature
RHESSI observations and flux data from SDO/AIA. Two fitting models are tested for the DEM; a Gaussian
distribution and a uniform DEM profile. A Gaussian fit proved unable to explain the observations
for any of the studied microflares. However, 8 of 10 events studied were reasonably fit by a uniform
DEM profile. Hence microflare plasma can be considered to be significantly multi-thermal, and
may not be significantly peaked or contain resolvable fine structure, within the uncertainties
of the observational instruments. The thermal and non-thermal energy is estimated for each microflare,
comparing the energy budget with an isothermal plasma assumption. From the multithermal fits the
minimum non-thermal energy content was found to average approximately 30% of the estimated thermal
energy. By comparison, under an isothermal model the non-thermal and thermal energy estimates
were generally comparable. Hence, multi-thermal plasma is an important consideration for solar
microflares that substantially alters their thermal and non-thermal energy content.
