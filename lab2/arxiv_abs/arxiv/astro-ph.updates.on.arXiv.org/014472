In order to gain a better understanding of the influence of cosmic rays (CRs) and magnetic fields
in the disk-halo interface of edge-on spiral galaxies, we investigate the radio continuum halo,
the magnetic field, and the transport processes of the CRs of the edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 4217 using
CHANG-ES radio data at two frequencies, 6 GHz (C-band) and 1.5 GHz (L-band), and supplemental LOFAR
data at 150 MHz and X-ray Chandra data. NGC 4217 shows a large-scale X-shaped magnetic field structure,
covering a major part of the galaxy with a mean total magnetic field strength in the disk of 9 micro
Gauss (via equipartition). Using rotation measure synthesis (RM-synthesis) at C-band, we found
that the direction of the disk magnetic field is pointing inward. A helical outflow structure is
furthermore present in the northwestern part of the galaxy, which is extended nearly 7 kpc into the
halo. More polarized emission is observed on the approaching side of the galaxy. With a simplified
galaxy disk model, we are able to explain that finding and predict that roughly 75% of edge-on spiral
galaxies will show higher polarized intensity on the approaching side. Many loop and shell structures
are found throughout the galaxy in total intensity at C-band. A superbubble-like structure is prominent
in total and polarized intensity, as well as in Halpha and optical dust filaments, being a possible
result of concentrated star formation in the disk. The flux density contribution of the disk in comparison
to the halo decreases toward lower frequencies. Total intensity profiles at the three radio frequencies
were fit with two-component exponential functions. The frequency dependence of the resulting
scale heights between C-band and L-band suggests advection to be the main CR transport process.
The 1D CR transport modeling (SPINNAKER) shows that advection appears to be more important than
diffusion.
