In this paper, we describe the kinematical and evolutionary properties of the impulsive cool jets
in the solar atmosphere using numerical simulation by Godunov-type PLUTO code at two different
strength of the quiet-Sun magnetic field (B=56, 112 Gauss). These types of chromospheric jets are
originated by the pressure pulse, which mimics after effects of the localized heating in the lower
solar atmosphere. These jets may be responsible for the transport of mass and energy in the localized
upper atmosphere (i.e., corona). The detection of the height-time profiles for the jets, originated
by imposing the different pressure pulses, exhibit the asymmetric near parabolic behaviour. This
infers that the upward motion of the jet occurs under the influence of pressure perturbation. However,
its downward motion is not only governed by the gravitational free fall, but also due to the complex
plasma motions near its base under the effect of counter propagating pulses. Maximum height and
life-time of the jets w.r.t. the strength of the pressure pulse show a linear increasing trend. This
suggests that if the extent of the heating and thus pressure perturbations will be longer then more
longer chromospheric jets can be triggered from the same location in the chromosphere. For the certain
amplitude of pressure pulse, the strong magnetic field configuration (B=112 Gauss) leads more
longer jet compared to the weaker field (B=56 Gauss). This suggests that the strong magnetic field
guides the pressure pulse driven jets more efficiency towards the higher corona. In conclusion,
our model mimics the properties and evolution of variety of the cool impulsive jets in the chromosphere
(e.g., macrospicules, network jets, isolated repeated cool jets, confined \& small surges etc).
