We present a multi-wavelength study of the massive ($M_{200\textrm{c}} \approx 1$-$2 \times 10^{15}
M_\odot$) galaxy clusters RXC J2248.7$-$4431, MACS J0416.1$-$2403, and MACS J1206.2$-$0847
at $z \approx 0.4$. Using the X-ray surface brightness of the clusters from deep Chandra data to model
their hot gas, we are able to disentangle this mass term from the diffuse dark matter in our new strong-lensing
analysis, with approximately $50$-$100$ secure multiple images per cluster, effectively separating
the collisional and collisionless mass components of the clusters. At a radial distance of $10\%$
of $R_{200\textrm{c}}$ (approximately $200$ kpc), we measure a projected total mass of $(0.129
\pm 0.001)$, $(0.131 \pm 0.001)$ and $(0.137 \pm 0.001)\times M_{200\textrm{c}}$, for RXC J2248,
MACS J0416 and MACS J1206, respectively. These values are surprisingly similar, considering the
large differences in the merging configurations, and, as a consequence, in the mass models of the
clusters. Interestingly, at the same radii, the hot gas over total mass fractions differ substantially,
ranging from $0.082 \pm 0.001$ to $0.133 \pm 0.001$, reflecting the various dynamical states of
the clusters. Moreover, we do not find a statistically significant offset between the positions
of the peak of the diffuse dark matter component and of the BCG in the more complex clusters of the sample.
We extend to this sample of clusters previous findings of a number of massive sub-halos higher than
in numerical simulations. These results highlight the importance of a proper separation of the
different mass components to study in detail the properties of dark matter in galaxy clusters.
