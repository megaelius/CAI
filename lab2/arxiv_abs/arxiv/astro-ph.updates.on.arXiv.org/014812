We present extensive observations of SN 2018zd covering the first $\sim450$\,d after the explosion.
This SN shows a possible shock-breakout signal $\sim3.6$\,hr after the explosion in the unfiltered
light curve, and prominent flash-ionisation spectral features within the first week. The unusual
photospheric temperature rise (rapidly from $\sim 12,000$\,K to above 18,000\,K) within the earliest
few days suggests that the ejecta were continuously heated. Both the significant temperature rise
and the flash spectral features can be explained with the interaction of the SN ejecta with the massive
stellar wind ($0.18^{+0.05}_{-0.10}\, \rm M_{\odot}$), which accounts for the luminous peak
($L_{\rm max} = [1.36\pm 0.63] \times 10^{43}\, \rm erg\,s^{-1}$) of SN 2018zd. The luminous peak
and low expansion velocity ($v \approx 3300$ km s$^{-1}$) make SN 2018zd to be like a member of the
LLEV (luminous SNe II with low expansion velocities) events originated due to circumstellar interaction.
The relatively fast post-peak decline allows a classification of SN 2018zd as a transition event
morphologically linking SNe~IIP and SNe~IIL. In the radioactive-decay phase, SN 2018zd experienced
a significant flux drop and behaved more like a low-luminosity SN~IIP both spectroscopically and
photometrically. This contrast indicates that circumstellar interaction plays a vital role in
modifying the observed light curves of SNe~II. Comparing nebular-phase spectra with model predictions
suggests that SN 2018zd arose from a star of $\sim 12\,\rm M_{\odot}$. Given the relatively small
amount of $^{56}$Ni ($0.013 - 0.035 \rm M_{\odot}$), the massive stellar wind, and the faint X-ray
radiation, the progenitor of SN 2018zd could be a massive asymptotic giant branch star which collapsed
owing to electron capture.
