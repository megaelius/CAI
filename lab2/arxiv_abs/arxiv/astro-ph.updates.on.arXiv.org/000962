Our goal is to perform in-depth ensemble asteroseismology of the young open cluster NGC2244 with
the 2-wheel Kepler mission. While the nominal Kepler mission already implied a revolution in stellar
physics for solar-type stars and red giants, it was not possible to perform asteroseismic studies
of massive OB stars because such targets were carefully avoided in the FoV in order not to disturb
the exoplanet hunting. Now is an excellent time to fill this hole in mission capacity and to focus
on the metal factories of the Universe, for which stellar evolution theory is least adequate. Our
white paper aims to remedy major shortcomings in the theory of stellar structure and evolution of
the most massive stars by focusing on a large ensemble of stars in a carefully selected young open
cluster. Cluster asteroseismology of very young stars such as those of NGC2244 has the major advantage
that all cluster stars have similar age, distance and initial chemical composition, implying drastic
restrictions for the stellar modeling compared to asteroseismology of single isolated stars with
very different ages and metallicities. Our study requires long-term photometric measurements
of stars with visual magnitude ranging from 6.5 to 15 in a large FoV with a precision better than 30
ppm for the brightest cluster members (magnitude below 9) up to 500 ppm for the fainter ones, which
is well achievable with 2-Wheel Kepler, in combination with high-precision high-resolution spectroscopy
and spectro-polarimetry of the brightest pulsating cluster members. These ground-based spectroscopic
data will be assembled with the HERMES and CORALIE spectrographs (twin 1.2m Mercator and Euler telescopes,
La Palma, Canary Islands and La Silla, Chile), as well as with the spectro-polarimetric NARVAL instrument
(2m BLT at the Pic du Midi, French Pyrenees), to which we have guaranteed access.
