The magnetic polarities of bipolar active regions (ARs) exhibit elongations in line-of-sight
magnetograms during their emergence. These elongations are referred to as magnetic tongues and
attributed to the presence of twist in the emerging magnetic flux-ropes (FRs) that form ARs. The
presence of magnetic tongues affects the measurement of any AR characteristic that depends on its
magnetic flux distribution. The AR tilt-angle is one of them. We aim to develop a method to isolate
and remove the flux associated with the tongues to determine the AR tilt-angle with as much precision
as possible. As a first approach, we used a simple emergence model of a FR. This allowed us to develop
and test our aim based on a method to remove the effects of magnetic tongues. Then, using the experience
gained from the analysis of the model, we applied our method to photospheric observations of bipolar
ARs that show clear magnetic tongues. Using the developed procedure on the FR model, we can reduce
the deviation in the tilt estimation by more than 60%. Next we illustrate the performance of the method
with four examples of bipolar ARs selected for their large magnetic tongues. The new method efficiently
removes the spurious rotation of the bipole. This correction is mostly independent of the method
input parameters and significant since it is larger than all the estimated tilt errors. We have developed
a method to isolate the magnetic flux associated with the FR core during the emergence of bipolar
ARs. This allows us to compute the AR tilt-angle and its evolution as precisely as possible. We suggest
that the high dispersion observed in the determination of AR tilt-angles in studies that massively
compute them from line-of sight magnetograms can be partly due to the existence of magnetic tongues
whose presence is not sufficiently acknowledged.
