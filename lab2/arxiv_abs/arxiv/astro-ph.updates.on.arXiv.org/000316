We construct a dust evolution model taking into account the grain size distribution, and investigate
what kind of dust processes determine the grain size distribution at each stage of galaxy evolution.
In addition to the dust production by type II supernovae (SNeII) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars, we consider three processes in the ISM: (i) dust destruction by SN shocks, (ii) metal accretion
onto the surface of preexisting grains in the cold neutral medium (CNM) (called grain growth), and
(iii) grain-grain collisions (shattering and coagulation) in the warm neutral medium (WNM) and
CNM. We found that the grain size distribution in galaxies is controlled by stellar sources in the
early stage of galaxy evolution, and that afterwards the main processes that govern the size distribution
changes to those in the ISM. Since shattering produces a large abundance of small grains (consequently,
the surface-to-volume ratio of grains increases), it enhances the efficiency of grain growth,
contributing to the significant increase of the total dust mass. Grain growth creates a large bump
in the grain size distribution around a ~ 0.01 \mu m. Coagulation occurs effectively after the number
of small grains is enhanced by shattering, and the grain size distribution is deformed to have a bump
at a ~ 0.03 - 0.05 \mu m at t ~ 10 Gyr. We conclude that the evolutions of the total dust mass and the grain
size distribution in galaxies are closely related to each other, and the grain size distribution
changes considerably through the galaxy evolution because the dominant dust processes which regulate
the grain size distribution change.
