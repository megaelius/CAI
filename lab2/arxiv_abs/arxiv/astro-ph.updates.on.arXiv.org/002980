The rate of tidal disruption events (TDEs) is predicted to depend on stellar conditions in the vicinity
of the super-massive black hole (SMBH). For most galaxies, the properties of this parsec-scale
region cannot be measured directly. Here, we test whether the TDE rate is correlated with global
galaxy properties, which are observable. We concentrate on surface stellar mass density ($\Sigma_{M_\star}$)
and velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$), which one would expect to be correlated with the density
and velocity dispersion of the stars around the SMBH. We analyze the host galaxies of 33 TDEs and find
that at a fixed stellar mass, TDE host galaxies are denser than the background galaxy population.
This higher density is significant in comparison with all galaxies, including the subsample of
star-forming galaxies. We confirm the earlier claim by Arcavi et al. and French et al. that quiescent
galaxies with strong Balmer absorption lines (many of which are post-starburst, aka E+A, galaxies)
are overrepresented among TDE hosts. Since these rare galaxies are on average denser than other
types of galaxies, their overrepresentation among TDE hosts might arise in part from their shared
higher density. Finally, we formulate an empirical relation between the TDE rate, $R_{\rm TDE}$,
$\Sigma_{M_\star}$, and $\sigma_v$, as $R_{\rm TDE}\propto \Sigma_{M_\star}^\alpha \times
\sigma_v^\beta$, and derive $\hat{\alpha}=0.9\pm0.2$ and $\hat{\beta}=-1.1\pm0.7$. The direct
(and significant) dependence on surface stellar mass density and inverse (though not significant)
dependence on stellar velocity dispersion support theoretical formulations of the TDE rate that
rely on dynamical relaxation of the stars around the SMBH.
