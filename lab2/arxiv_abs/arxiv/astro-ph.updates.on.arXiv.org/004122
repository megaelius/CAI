We present Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) Integral field Unit (IFU), Very Large Array
(VLA) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the OH Megamaser (OHM) galaxy IRASF23199+0123.
Our observations show that this system is an interacting pair, with two OHM sources associated to
the eastern (IRAS23199E) member. The two members of the pair present somewhat extended radio emission
at 3 and 20~cm, with flux peaks at each nucleus. The GMOS-IFU observations cover the inner $\sim$6kpc
of IRAS23199E at a spatial resolution of 2.3~kpc. The GMOS-IFU flux distributions in H$\alpha$
and [NII]$\lambda$6583 are similar to that of an HST [NII]+H$\alpha$ narrow-band image, being
more extended along the northeast-southwest direction, as also observed in the continuum HST F814W
image. The GMOS-IFU H$\alpha$ flux map of IRAS23199E shows three extranuclear knots attributed
to star-forming complexes. We have discovered a Seyfert 1 nucleus in this galaxy, as its nuclear
spectrum shows an unresolved broad (FWHM$\approx$2170 kms$^{-1}$) double-peaked H$\alpha$
component, from which we derive a black hole mass of M$_{BH}$= 3.8$^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\times 10^{6}$M$_{\odot}$.
The gas kinematics shows low velocity dispersions ($\sigma$) and low [NII]/H$\alpha$ ratios for
the star-forming complexes and higher $\sigma$ and [NII]/H$\alpha$ surrounding the radio emission
region, supporting interaction between the radio-plasma and ambient gas. The two OH masers detected
in IRASF23199E are observed in the vicinity of these enhanced $\sigma$ regions, supporting their
association with the active nucleus and its interaction with the surrounding gas. The gas velocity
field can be partially reproduced by rotation in a disk, with residuals along the north-south direction
being tentatively attributed to emission from the front walls of a bipolar outflow.
