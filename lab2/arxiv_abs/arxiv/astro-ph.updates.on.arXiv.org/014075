We investigate the possibility to apply the already suggested by Sarafopoulos (2017, 2019) main
concept of dynamo action to red dwarfs and red giant and supergiant stars. Thus, we attempt to establish
a unified dynamo action, being potentially at work at widely varying stellar domains. Thus, the
powerful, unique and leading entity generating the primary stellar magnetic field remains the
so-called Torus structure. Within the Torus the same sign charges are mutually attracted and the
Torus could be simulated as a superconductor. An existing gradient of the rotation rate accumulates
net charge in the Torus, and the resulting toroidal current becomes the driving source of the magnetic
field. In turn, there is a complicated network of secondary interactions that affect and modulate
the whole star's magnetic behaviour. Our dynamo action is potentially at work in fully and partly
convecting stars. A major finding is that the strength of the magnetic field, for stars of the same
spectral type, is essentially controlled by the size of the star; we suggest that, the larger the
star, the deeper inward the Torus is formed. The formation of a single Torus is essentially associated
with a large-scale strong, poloidal and axisymmetric magnetic field topology, whereas the generation
of a weaker multipolar, non-axisymmetric field configuration in rapid evolution can result from
a double-Torus structure (like the solar case). The same basic concept is scaled up or down. Moreover,
we identify four key parameters associated with the magnetic field of red dwarfs, giants and supergiants:
First, the rotation speed; second, the steepness of the radial gradient of the rotation rate in the
shear layer; third, the distance of the Torus from the photosphere and fourth, the cross-sectional
area of the Torus. The third and fourth key parameters are introduced for the first time.
