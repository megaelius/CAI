The sustained increase of emissions of artificial light is causing a progressive brightening of
the night sky in most of the world. This process represents a threat for the long-term sustainability
of the scientific and educational activity of ground-based astronomical observatories operating
in the optical range. Huge investments in building, scientific and technical workforce, equipment
and maintenance can be at risk if the increasing light pollution levels hinder the capability of
carrying out the top-level scientific observations for which these key scientific infrastructures
were built. In addition, light pollution has other negative consequences, as e.g. biodiversity
endangering and the loss of the starry sky for recreational, touristic, and cultural enjoyment.
The traditional light pollution mitigation approach is based on imposing conditions on the photometry
of individual sources, but the aggregated effects of all sources in the territory surrounding the
observatories are seldom addressed in the regulations. We propose that this approach shall be complemented
with a top-down, inmission limits strategy, whereby clear limits are established to the admissible
deterioration of the night sky above the observatories. We describe the general form of the indicators
that can be employed to this end, and develop linear models relating their values to the artificial
emissions across the territory. This approach can be extended to take into account for other protection
needs, and it is expected to be useful for making informed decisions on public lighting, in the context
of wider spatial planning projects.
