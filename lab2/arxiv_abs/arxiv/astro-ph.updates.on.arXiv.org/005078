Condensation of H 2 in the interstellar medium (ISM) has long been seen as a possibility, either by
deposition on dust grains or thanks to a phase transition combined with self-gravity. H 2 condensation
might explain the observed low efficiency of star formation and might help to hide baryons in spiral
galaxies. Our aim is to quantify the solid fraction of H 2 in the ISM due to a phase transition including
self-gravity for different densities and temperatures in order to use the results in more complex
simulations of the ISM as subgrid physics. We used molecular dynamics simulations of fluids at different
temperatures and densities to study the formation of solids. Once the simulations reached a steady
state, we calculated the solid mass fraction, energy increase, and timescales. By determining
the power laws measured over several orders of magnitude, we extrapolated to lower densities the
higher density fluids that can be simulated with current computers. The solid fraction and energy
increase of fluids in a phase transition are above 0.1 and do not follow a power law. Fluids out of a
phase transition are still forming a small amount of solids due to chance encounters of molecules.
The solid mass fraction and energy increase of these fluids are linearly dependent on density and
can easily be extrapolated. The timescale is below one second, the condensation can be considered
instantaneous. The presence of solid H 2 grains has important dynamic implications on the ISM as
they may be the building blocks for larger solid bodies when gravity is included. We provide the solid
mass fraction, energy increase, and timescales for high density fluids and extrapolation laws
for lower densities.
