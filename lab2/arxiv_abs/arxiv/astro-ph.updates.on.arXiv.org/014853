Ground-based and spacecraft telescopic observations, combined with an intensive modeling effort,
have greatly enhanced our understanding of hot giant planets and brown dwarfs over the past ten years.
Although these objects are all fluid, hydrogen worlds with stratified atmospheres overlying convective
interiors, they exhibit an impressive diversity of atmospheric behavior. Hot Jupiters are strongly
irradiated, and a wealth of observations constrain the day-night temperature differences, circulation,
and cloudiness. The intense stellar irradiation, presumed tidal locking and modest rotation leads
to a novel regime of strong day-night radiative forcing. Circulation models predict large day-night
temperature differences, global-scale eddies, patchy clouds, and, in most cases, a fast eastward
jet at the equator-equatorial superrotation. The warm Jupiters may exhibit a wide range of rotation
rates, obliquities, and orbital eccentricities, which, along with the weaker irradiation, leads
to circulation patterns and observable signatures predicted to differ substantially from hot
Jupiters. Brown dwarfs are typically isolated, rapidly rotating worlds; they radiate enormous
energy fluxes into space and convect vigorously in their interiors. Their atmospheres exhibit
patchiness in clouds and temperature on regional to global scales-the result of modulation by large-scale
atmospheric circulation. Despite the lack of irradiation, such circulations can be driven by interaction
of the interior convection with the overlying atmosphere, as well as self-organization of patchiness
due to cloud-dynamical-radiative feedbacks. Finally, irradiated brown dwarfs help to bridge
the gap between these classes of objects, experiencing intense external irradiation as well as
vigorous interior convection. A hierarchy of modeling approaches have yielded major new insights
into the dynamics governing these phenomena.
