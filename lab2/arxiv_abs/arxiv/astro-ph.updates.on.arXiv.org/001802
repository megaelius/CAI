We have investigated some features of the density and arrival time distributions of Cherenkov photons
in extensive air showers using different high and low energy hadronic interaction models available
in the CORSIKA simulation package. We have found that, for all primary particles, their energies
and hadronic interaction model combinations, the density distribution patterns of Cherenkov
photons follow the negative exponential function with different coefficients and slopes depending
on the type of primary particle, its energy and the type of model combination. Whereas the arrival
time distribution patterns of Cherenkov photons follow the function of the form $t (r) = t_{0}e^{\Gamma/r^{\lambda}}$,
with different values of the function parameters. Flatness of the density distribution increases
with decreasing energy and increasing mass of the primary particle. The shift from the spherical
shape of the arrival time distribution near the shower core increases with increasing mass of the
low energy primary particle. There is no significant effect of hadronic interaction model combinations
on the density and arrival time distributions for the $\gamma$-ray primaries. However, for the
hadronic showers, the effects of the model combinations are significant under different conditions.
There are some contributions from shower to shower fluctuations to the density and arrival time
deviations of Cherenkov photons apart from the contribution due to inherent differences in hadronic
interaction models. Study of the effect of altitude of the observation level and energy of the primary
particle on the density and arrival time distributions shows some interesting results.
