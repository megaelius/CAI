Metis is the first solar coronagraph designed for a space mission capable of performing simultaneous
imaging of the off-limb solar corona in both visible and UV light. The observations obtained with
Metis aboard the Solar Orbiter ESA-NASA observatory will enable us to diagnose, with unprecedented
temporal coverage and spatial resolution, the structures and dynamics of the full corona from 1.7
$R_\odot$ to about 9 $R_\odot$. Due to the uniqueness of the Solar Orbiter mission profile, Metis
will be able to observe the solar corona from a close vantage point (down to 0.28 AU), achieving out-of-ecliptic
views with the increase of the orbit inclination over time. Moreover, observations near perihelion,
during the phase of lower rotational velocity of the solar surface relative to the spacecraft, will
allow longer-term studies of the coronal features. Thanks to a novel occultation design and a combination
of a UV interference coating of the mirrors and a spectral bandpass filter, Metis images the solar
corona simultaneously in the visible light band, between 580 and 640 nm, and in the UV H I Lyman-{\alpha}
line at 121.6 nm. The coronal images in both the UV Lyman-{\alpha} and polarised visible light are
obtained at high spatial resolution with a spatial scale down to about 2000 km and 15000 km at perihelion,
in the cases of the visible and UV light, respectively. A temporal resolution down to 1 second can
be achieved when observing coronal fluctuations in visible light. The Metis measurements will
allow for complete characterisation of the main physical parameters and dynamics of the electron
and neutral hydrogen/proton plasma components of the corona in the region where the solar wind undergoes
acceleration and where the onset and initial propagation of coronal mass ejections take place,
thus significantly improving our understanding of the region connecting the Sun to the heliosphere.
