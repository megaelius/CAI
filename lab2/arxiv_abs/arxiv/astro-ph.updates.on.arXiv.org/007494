With contemporary infrared spectroscopic surveys like APOGEE, red-giant stars can be observed
to distances and extinctions at which Gaia parallaxes are not highly informative. Yet the combination
of effective temperature, surface gravity, composition, and age - all accessible through spectroscopy
- determines a giant's luminosity. Therefore spectroscopy plus photometry should enable precise
spectrophotometric distance estimates. Here we use the APOGEE-Gaia-2MASS-WISE overlap to train
a data-driven model to predict parallaxes for red-giant branch stars with $0<\log g\leq2.2$ (more
luminous than the red clump). We employ (the exponentiation of) a linear function of APOGEE spectral
pixel intensities and multi-band photometry to predict parallax spectrophotometrically. The
model training involves no logarithms or inverses of the Gaia parallaxes, and needs no cut on the
Gaia parallax signal-to-noise ratio. It includes an L1 regularization to zero out the contributions
of uninformative pixels. The training is performed with leave-out subsamples such that no star's
astrometry is used even indirectly in its spectrophotometric parallax estimate. The model implicitly
performs a reddening and extinction correction in its parallax prediction, without any explicit
dust model. We assign to each star in the sample a new spectrophotometric parallax estimate; these
parallaxes have uncertainties of a few to 15 percent, depending on data quality, which is more precise
than the Gaia parallax for the vast majority of targets, and certainly any stars more than a few kpc
distance. We obtain 10-percent distance estimates out to heliocentric distances of $20\,$kpc,
and make global maps of the Milky Way's disk.
