The relative velocity distribution of wide binary (WB) stars is sensitive to the law of gravity at
the low accelerations typical of galactic outskirts. I consider the feasibility of this wide binary
test using the `line velocity' method. This involves considering only the velocity components
along the direction within the sky plane orthogonal to the systemic proper motion of each WB. I apply
this technique to the WB sample of Hernandez et. al. (2019), carefully accounting for large-angle
effects at one order beyond leading. Based on Monte Carlo trials, the uncertainty in the one-dimensional
velocity dispersion is $\approx 100$ m/s when using sky-projected relative velocities. Using
line velocities reduces this to $\approx 30$ m/s because these are much less affected by distance
uncertainties. My analysis does not support the Hernandez et. al. (2019) claim of a clear departure
from Newtonian dynamics beyond a radius of $\approx 10$ kAU, partly because I use $2\sigma$ outlier
rejection to clean their sample first. Nonetheless, the uncertainties are small enough that existing
WB data are nearly sufficient to distinguish Newtonian dynamics from Modified Newtonian Dynamics.
I estimate that $\approx 1000$ WB systems will be required for this purpose if using only line velocities.
In addition to a larger sample, it will also be important to control for systematics like undetected
companions and moving groups. This could be done statistically. The contamination can be minimized
by considering a narrow theoretically motivated range of parameters and focusing on how different
theories predict different proportions of WBs in this region.
