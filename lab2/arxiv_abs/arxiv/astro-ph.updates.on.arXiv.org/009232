Type II supernovae (SNe) stem from the core collapse of massive ($>8\ M_{\odot}$) stars. Owing to
their short lifespan, we expect a very low rate of such events in elliptical host galaxies, where
the star-formation rate is low, and which mostly consist of an old stellar population. SN 2016hil
(iPTF16hil) is a Type II supernova located in the extreme outskirts of an elliptical galaxy at redshift
$z=0.0608$ (projected distance $27.2$ kpc). It was detected near peak brightness ($M_{r} \approx
-17$ mag) 9 days after the last nondetection. SN 2016hil has some potentially peculiar properties:
while presenting a characteristic spectrum, the event was unusually short lived and declined by
$\sim 1.5$ mag in $< 40$ days, following an apparently double-peaked light curve. Its spectra suggest
a low metallicity ($Z<0.4\ Z_{\odot}$). We place a tentative upper limit on the mass of a potential
faint host at $\log(M/M_{\odot}) =7.27^{+0.43}_{-0.24}$ using deep Keck optical imaging. In
light of this, we discuss the possibility of the progenitor forming locally, and other more exotic
formation scenarios such as a merger or common-envelope evolution causing a time-delayed explosion.
Further observations of the explosion site in the ultraviolet are needed in order to distinguish
between the cases. Regardless of the origin of the transient, observing a population of such seemingly
hostless Type II SNe could have many uses, including an estimate the number of faint galaxies in a
given volume, and tests of the prediction of a time-delayed population of core-collapse SNe in locations
otherwise unfavorable for the detection of such events.
