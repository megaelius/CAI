The ubiquity of Lyman alpha (Ly$\alpha$) emission in a sample of four bright [O III]-strong star-forming
galaxies with redshifts above 7 has led to the suggestion that such luminous sources represent a
distinct population compared to their fainter, more numerous, counterparts. The presence of Ly$\alpha$
emission within the reionization era could indicate that these sources created early ionized bubbles
due to their unusually strong radiation, possibly due to the presence of active galactic nuclei.
To test this hypothesis we have secured long integration spectra with XSHOOTER on the VLT for three
$z\simeq$7 sources selected to have similar luminosities and prominent excess fluxes in the IRAC
3.6 or 4.5$\mu$m band, usually attributed to strong [O III] emission. We secured additional spectroscopy
for one of these galaxies at $z$=7.15 using MOSFIRE at the Keck telescope. For this, the most well-studied
source in our sample with the strongest IRAC excess, we detect prominent nebular emission from He
II and NV indicative of a non-thermal source. For the other two sources at $z$=6.81 and $z$=6.85,
for which no previous optical/near infrared spectroscopy was initially available, Ly$\alpha$
is seen in one and CIII] emission in the other. Although a modest sample, our results further support
the hypothesis that the phenomenon of intense [O III] emission is associated preferentially with
sources lying in early ionized bubbles. However, even though one of our sources at $z$=7.15 clearly
indicates the presence of non-thermal radiation, such ionized bubbles may not uniquely arise in
this manner. We discuss the unique advantages of extending such challenging diagnostic studies
with JWST.
