We study the non-linear behavior of the baryon acoustic oscillation in the power spectrum and the
correlation function by decomposing the dark matter perturbations into the short- and long-wavelength
modes. The evolution of the dark matter fluctuations can be described as a global coordinate transformation
caused by the long-wavelength displacement vector acting on short-wavelength matter perturbation
undergoing non-linear growth. Using this feature, we investigate the well known cancellation
of the high-$k$ solutions in the standard perturbation theory. While the standard perturbation
theory naturally satisfies the cancellation of the high-$k$ solutions, some of the recently proposed
improved perturbation theories do not guarantee the cancellation. We show that this cancellation
clarifies the success of the standard perturbation theory at the 2-loop order in describing the
amplitude of the non-linear power spectrum even at high-$k$ regions.We propose an extension of
the standard 2-loop level perturbation theory model of the non-linear power spectrum that more
accurately models the non-linear evolution of the baryon acoustic oscillation than the standard
perturbation theory. The model consists of simple and intuitive parts: the non-linear evolution
of the smoothed power spectrum without the baryon acoustic oscillations and the non-linear evolution
of the baryon acoustic oscillations due to the large-scale velocity of dark matter and due to the
gravitational attraction between dark matter particles. Our extended model predicts the smoothing
parameter of the baryon acoustic oscillation peak at $z=0.35$ as $\sim 7.7\ {\rm Mpc}/h$ and describes
the small non-linear shift in the peak position due to the galaxy random motions.
