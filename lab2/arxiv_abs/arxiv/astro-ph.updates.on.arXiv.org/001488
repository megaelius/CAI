In order to study the temperature distribution of the extended gas within the Orion Kleinmann-Low
nebula, we have mapped the emission by methyl cyanide (CH3CN) in its J=6_K-5_K, J=12_K-11_K, J=13_K-12_K,
and J=14_K-13_K transitions at an average angular resolution of ~10 arcsec (22 arcsec for the 6_K-5_K
lines), as part of a new 2D line survey of this region using the IRAM 30m telescope. These fully sampled
maps show extended emission from warm gas to the northeast of IRc2 and the distinct kinematic signatures
of the hot core and compact ridge source components. We have constructed population diagrams for
the four sets of K-ladder emission lines at each position in the maps and have derived rotational
excitation temperatures and total beam-averaged column densities from the fitted slopes. In addition,
we have fitted LVG model spectra to the observations to determine best-fit physical parameters
at each map position, yielding the distribution of kinetic temperatures across the region. The
resulting temperature maps reveal a region of hot (T > 350 K) material surrounding the northeastern
edge of the hot core, whereas the column density distribution is more uniform and peaks near the position
of IRc2. We attribute this region of hot gas to shock heating caused by the impact of outflowing material
from active star formation in the region, as indicated by the presence of broad CH3CN lines. This
scenario is consistent with predictions from C-shock chemical models that suggest that gas-phase
methyl cyanide survives in the post-shock gas and can be somewhat enhanced due to sputtering of grain
mantles in the passing shock front.
