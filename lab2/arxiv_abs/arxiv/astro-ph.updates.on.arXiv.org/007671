Observations have discovered numerous giant molecular filaments (GMFs) in the Milky Way. However,
their role in the Galactic star formation and Galaxy-scale evolution of dense gas is still unknown.
We investigate systematically the star-forming content of all currently known GMFs. This allows
us to estimate the star formation rates (SFRs) of the GMFs and to establish relationships between
the SFRs and the GMF properties. We identify and classify the young stellar object (YSO) population
of each GMF using multi-wavelength photometry from near- to far-infrared. We estimate the total
SFRs assuming a universal and fully sampled initial mass function and luminosity function. We uniformly
estimate the physical properties of 57 GMFs. The GMFs show correlations between the 13CO line width,
mass, and size, similar to Larson's relations. We identify 36 394 infrared excess sources in 57 GMFs
and obtain SFRs for 46 GMFs. The median SFR surface density (Sigma_SFR) and star formation efficiency
(SFE) of GMFs are 0.62 Msun Myr-1 pc-2 and 1%, similar to the nearby star-forming clouds. The star
formation rate per free-fall time of GMFs is between 0.002-0.05 with the median value of 0.02. We
also find a strong correlation between SFR and dense gas mass that is defined as gas mass above a visual
extinction of 7 mag, which suggests that the SFRs of the GMFs scale similarly with dense gas as those
of nearby molecular clouds. We also find a strong correlation between the mean SFR per unit length
and dense gas mass per unit length. The origin of this scaling remains unknown, calling for further
studies that can link the structure of GMFs to their SF activity and explore the differences between
GMFs and other molecular clouds
