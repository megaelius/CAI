The recent close approach of the NEA (3200) Phaethon offered a rare opportunity to obtain high-quality
observational data. We used the newly obtained optical light curves to improve the spin and shape
model of Phaethon and to determine its surface physical properties derived by thermophysical modeling.
We also used the available astrometric observations of Phaethon, including those obtained by the
Arecibo radar and the Gaia spacecraft, to constrain the secular drift of the orbital semimajor axis.
This constraint allowed us to estimate the bulk density by assuming that the drift is dominated by
the Yarkovsky effect. We used the convex inversion model to derive the 3D shape model of Phaethon,
and a detailed numerical approach for an accurate analysis of the Yarkovsky effect. We obtained
a unique solution for Phaethon's pole orientation at $(318,-47)^{\circ}$ ecliptic longitude
and latitude (uncertainty of $5^{\circ}$), and confirm the previously reported thermophysical
properties ($D=5.1\pm0.2$ km, $\Gamma=600\pm200$ SI). Phaethon has a top-like shape with possible
north-south asymmetry. The characteristic size of the regolith grains is 1-2 cm. The orbit analysis
reveals a secular drift of the semimajor axis of $-(6.9\pm1.9)\times 10^{-4}$ au Myr$^{-1}$. With
the derived volume-equivalent size of 5.1~km, the bulk density $\rho$ is $1.67\pm0.47$ g cm$^{-3}$.
If the size is slightly larger $\sim5.7$ km, as suggested by radar data, $\rho$ would decrease to
$1.48\pm0.42$ g cm$^{-3}$. We further investigated the suggestion that Phaethon may be in a cluster
with asteroids (155140) 2005 UD and (225416) 1999 YC that was formed by rotational fission of a critically
spinning parent body. Phaethon's $\rho$ is consistent with typical values for large ($>100$ km)
C-complex asteroids and supports its association with asteroid (2) Pallas. These findings render
a cometary origin unlikely for Phaethon.
