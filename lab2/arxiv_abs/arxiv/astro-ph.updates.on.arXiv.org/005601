The second Gaia data release (Gaia-DR2) contains, beyond the astrometry, three-band photometry
for 1.38 billion sources. We have used these three broad bands to infer stellar effective temperatures,
Teff, for all sources brighter than G=17 mag with Teff in the range 3000-10 000 K (161 million sources).
Using in addition the parallaxes, we infer the line-of-sight extinction, A_G, and the reddening,
E[BP-RP], for 88 million sources. Together with a bolometric correction we derive luminosity and
radius for 77 million sources. These quantities as well as their estimated uncertainties are part
of Gaia-DR2. Here we describe the procedures by which these quantities were obtained, including
the underlying assumptions, comparison with literature estimates, and the limitations of our
results. Typical accuracies are of order 324 K (Teff), 0.46 mag (A_G), 0.23 mag (E[BP-RP]), 15% (luminosity),
and 10% (radius). Being based on only a small number of observable quantities and limited training
data, our results are necessarily subject to some extreme assumptions that can lead to strong systematics
in some cases (not included in the aforementioned accuracy estimates). One aspect is the non-negativity
contraint of our estimates, in particular extinction. Yet in several regions of parameter space
our results show very good performance, for example for red clump stars and solar analogues. Large
uncertainties render the extinctions less useful at the individual star level, but they show good
performance for ensemble estimates. We identify regimes in which our parameters should and should
not be used and we define a "clean" sample. Despite the limitations, this is the largest catalogue
of uniformly-inferred stellar parameters to date. More precise and detailed astrophysical parameters
based on the full BP/RP spectrophotometry are planned as part of the third Gaia data release.
