Baryonic feedback effects lead to a suppression of the weak-lensing angular power spectrum on small
scales. The poorly constrained shape and amplitude of this suppression is an important source of
uncertainties for upcoming cosmological weak-lensing surveys such as Euclid or LSST. In this first
paper in a series of two, we use simulations to build a Euclid-like tomographic mock data-set for
the cosmic shear power spectrum and the corresponding covariance matrix, which are both corrected
for baryons following the baryonification method of Schneider et al. (2019). In addition, we develop
an emulator to obtain fast predictions of the baryonic suppression effects, allowing us to perform
a likelihood inference analysis for a standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with both cosmological
and astrophysical parameters. Our main findings are the following: (i) ignoring baryonic effects
leads to a greater than 5$\sigma$ bias on the cosmological parameters $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$;
(ii) restricting the analysis to the largest scales, that are mostly unaffected by baryons, makes
the bias disappear, but results in a blow-up of the $\Omega_m$-$\sigma_8$ contour area by more than
a factor of 10; (iii) ignoring baryonic effects on the covariance matrix does not significantly
affect cosmological parameter estimates; (iv) while the baryonic suppression is mildly cosmology
dependent, this effect does not noticeably modify the posterior contours. Overall, we conclude
that including baryonic uncertainties in terms of nuisance parameters allows us to obtain unbiased
and surprisingly tight constraints on cosmological parameters.
