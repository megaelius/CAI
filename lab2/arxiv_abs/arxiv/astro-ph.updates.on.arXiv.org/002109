We present an analysis of $\sim 13000$ stars from RAVE Data Release 4 (DR4) to better understand the
formation of the thick disk. The stars we consider are mostly within 1 kpc of the Sun. Based on a Monte-Carlo
analysis of the data and comparison with a toy model, we suggest the thick disk formed fairly rapidly
when [Mg/Fe] $\approx 0.2 - 0.3$. We consider an origin via direct accretion unlikely as the thick
disk is fast-rotating and fairly metal-rich for its age. As internal disk heating can not easily
reach the high observed velocity dispersions and would likely be more gradual, it also appears implausible.
A very early formation of the thick disk (e.g. from star formation in the collapsing primordial gas
cloud of the Milky Way) appears unlikely given it would require [Mg/Fe] $\geq$ 0.4 at the time the
thick disk formed. An origin via tidal interaction with another galaxy is one of the few remaining
possibilities. Our proposed explanation for the nature of the event which formed the thick disk
is a close flyby of Andromeda, whose orbital dynamics in MOND are consistent with our estimate that
the event occurred 7-11 Gyr ago. This leads to reasonable thick disk velocity dispersions. It will
be important to determine whether the event heated the outer regions of the thin disk uniformly or
if substantial portions of it were left largely unaffected. This may distinguish between models
(like ours) involving a single close encounter and models with multiple encounters (as common in
mergers). The main limiting factor at present seems to be the accuracy of elemental abundances and
lack of direct observations at different galactocentric radii to the Sun.
