We present the first version of the ALeRCE (Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events)
broker light curve classifier. ALeRCE is currently processing the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)
alert stream, in preparation for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. The ALeRCE light curve classifier
uses variability features computed from the ZTF alert stream, and colors obtained from AllWISE
and ZTF photometry. We apply a Balanced Hierarchical Random Forest algorithm with a two-level scheme,
where the top level classifies each source as periodic, stochastic, or transient, and the bottom
level further resolve each hierarchical class, yielding a total of 15 classes. This classifier
corresponds to the first attempt to classify multiple classes of stochastic variables (including
nucleus- and host-dominated active galactic nuclei, blazars, young stellar objects, and cataclysmic
variables) in addition to different classes of periodic and transient sources, using real data.
We created a labeled set using various public catalogs (such as the Catalina Surveys and {\em Gaia}
DR2 variable stars catalogs, and the Million Quasars catalog), and we classify all objects with
$\geq6$ $g$-band or $\geq6$ $r$-band detections in ZTF (868,371 sources as of 2020/06/09), providing
updated classifications for sources with new alerts every day. For the top level we obtain macro-averaged
precision and recall scores of 0.96 and 0.99, respectively, and for the bottom level we obtain macro-averaged
precision and recall scores of 0.57 and 0.76, respectively. Updated classifications from the light
curve classifier can be found at this http URL
