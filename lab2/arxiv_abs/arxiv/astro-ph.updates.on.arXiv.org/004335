To fully harvest the rich library of stellar elemental abundance data, we require reliable models
that facilitate our interpretation of them. Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models are one example,
and a key part is the selection of chemical yields from different nucleosynthetic enrichment channels,
commonly asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, type Ia and core-collapse supernovae (SN Ia & CC-SN).
We present a scoring system for yield tables based on their ability to reproduce proto-solar abundances
within a simple parametrisation of the GCE modelling software Chempy. This marginalises over five
galactic parameters, describing simple stellar populations (SSP) and interstellar medium (ISM)
physics. Two statistical scoring methods, based on Bayesian evidence and leave-one-out cross-validation,
are applied to four CC-SN tables; (a) for all mutually available elements and (b) for the 9 most abundant
elements. We find that the yields of West & Heger (2017, in prep.) and Chieffi & Limongi (2004) (C04)
are preferred for the two cases. For (b) the inferred best-fit parameters using C04 are $\alpha_\mathrm{IMF}=-2.45^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$
for the IMF high-mass slope and $\mathrm{N}_\mathrm{Ia}=1.29^{+0.45}_{-0.31}\times10^{-3}$
M$_\odot^{-1}$ for the SN Ia normalisation. These are broadly consistent across tested yield tables
and elemental subsets, whilst not simply reproducing the priors. For (b) all yield tables consistently
over- (under-)predict Si (Mg) which can be mitigated by lowering CC-SN explosion energies. Additionally,
we show that Chempy can dramatically improve abundance predictions of hydrodynamical simulations
by plugging tailored best-fit SSP parameters into a Milky Way analogue from Gutcke & Springel (2017).
Our code, including a comprehensive tutorial, is freely available and can also provide SSP enrichment
tables for any set of parameters and yield tables.
