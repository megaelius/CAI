We present the discovery of a nuclear transient with the Caltech-NRAO Stripe 82 Survey (CNSS), a
dedicated radio transient survey carried out with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). This
transient, CNSS J001947.3+003527, exhibited a turn-on over a timescale of $\lesssim$1 yr, increasing
in flux density at 3 GHz from $<0.14$ mJy in February 2014 to $4.4\pm0.1$ mJy in March 2015, reaching
a peak luminosity of $5\times10^{28} \text{erg s}^{-1} \text{Hz}^{-1}$ around October 2015.
The association of CNSS J0019+00 with the nucleus (Gaia and our VLBI positions are consistent to
within 1 pc) of a nearby S0 Seyfert galaxy at 77 Mpc, together with the radio spectral evolution, implies
that this transient is most likely a tidal disruption event (TDE). Our equipartition analysis indicates
the presence of a $\sim$15,000 km s$^{-1}$ outflow, having energy $\sim$10$^{49}$ erg. We derive
the radial density profile for the circum-nuclear material in the host galaxy to be proportional
to R$^{-2.5}$. All of these properties suggest resemblance with radio-detected thermal TDEs like
ASASSN-14li and XMMSL1 J0740-85. No significant X-ray or optical emission is detected from CNSS
J0019+00, although this may simply be due to the thermal emission being weak during our late-time
follow up observations. From the CNSS survey we have obtained the first unbiased measurement of
the rate of radio TDEs, $R(>500 \mu{\rm Jy})$ of about $2\times10^{-3}$ deg$^{-2}$, or equivalently
a volumetric rate of about 10 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. This rate implies that all-sky radio surveys
such as the VLA Sky Survey and those planned with ASKAP, will find many tens of radio TDEs over the next
few years.
