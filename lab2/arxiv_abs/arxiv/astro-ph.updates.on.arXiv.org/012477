An observation of Jupiter's tidal response is anticipated for the on-going Juno spacecraft mission.
We combine self-consistent, numerical models of Jupiter's equilibrium tidal response with observed
Doppler shifts from the Juno gravity science experiment to test the sensitivity of the spacecraft
to tides raised by the Galilean satellites and the Sun. The concentric Maclaurin spheroid (CMS)
method finds the equilibrium shape and gravity field of a rotating, liquid planet with the tide raised
by a satellite, expanded in Love numbers ($k_{nm}$). We present improvements to CMS theory that
eliminate an unphysical center of mass offset and study in detail the convergence behavior of the
CMS approach. We demonstrate that the dependence of $k_{nm}$ with orbital distance is important
when considering the combined tidal response for Jupiter. Conversely, the details of the interior
structure have a negligible influence on $k_{nm}$, for models that match the zonal harmonics $J_2$,
$J_4$ and $J_6$, already measured to high precision by Juno. As the mission continues, improved
coverage of Jupiter's gravity field at different phases of Io's orbit is expected to yield an observed
value for the degree-2 Love number ($k_{22}$) and potentially select higher--degree $k_{nm}$.
We present a test of the sensitivity of the Juno Doppler signal to the calculated $k_{nm}$, which
suggests the detectability of $k_{33}$, $k_{42}$ and $k_{31}$, in addition to $k_{22}$. A mismatch
of a robust Juno observation with the remarkably small range in calculated Io equilibrium $k_{22}=0.58976\pm0.0001$,
would indicate a heretofore uncharacterized dynamic contribution to the tides.
