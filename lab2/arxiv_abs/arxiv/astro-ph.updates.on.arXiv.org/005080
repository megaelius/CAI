The Young Local Associations constitute an excellent sample to study a variety of astrophysical
topics, especially the star formation process in low density environments. Data coming from the
Gaia mission allows to undertake studies of the YLAs with unprecedented accuracy. We aim to determine
the dynamical age and place of birth of a set of associations in a uniform and dynamically consistent
manner. Our sample of YLAs includes $\epsilon$ Chamaeleontis, TW Hydrae, $\beta$ Pictoris, Octans,
Tucana-Horologium, Columba, Carina, Argus and AB Doradus. We design a method to derive the dynamical
age of the YLAs based on the orbital integration. It includes a strategy to account for the effect
of the observational errors. We test the method using mock YLAs. Finally, we apply it to our set of
9 YLAs with astrometry from the first Gaia data release and complementary on-ground radial velocities
from the literature. Our orbital analysis yields a first estimate of the dynamical age of 3$^{+9}_{-0}$
Myr, 13$^{+7}_{-0}$ Myr and 5$^{+23}_{-0}$ Myr for $\epsilon$ Cha, $\beta$ Pict and Tuc-Hor, respectively.
For four other associations (Oct, Col, Car and Arg), we provide a lower limit for the dynamical age.
Our rigorous error treatment indicates that TW Hya and AB Dor deserve further study. Our dynamical
ages are compatible spectroscopic and isochrone fitting ages obtained elsewhere. From the orbital
analysis, we suggest a scenario where there were two episodes of star formation: one ~40 Myr ago in
the first quadrant that gave birth to $\epsilon$ Cha, TW Hya and $\beta$ Pic, and another 5-15 Myr
ago close to the Sun that formed Tuc-Hor, Col, and Car. Future Gaia data will provide the necessary
accuracy to improve the present results, especially for the controversial age determinations,
and additional evidence for the proposed scenario, once a complete census of YLAs and better membership
can be obtained.
