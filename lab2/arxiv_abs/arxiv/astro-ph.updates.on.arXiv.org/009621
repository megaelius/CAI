SPICA, the cryogenic infrared space telescope recently pre-selected for a `Phase A' concept study
as one of the three remaining candidates for ESA's fifth medium class (M5) mission, is foreseen to
include a far-infrared polarimetric imager (SPICA-POL, now called B-BOP), which would offer a
unique opportunity to resolve major issues in our understanding of the nearby, cold magnetized
Universe. This paper presents an overview of the main science drivers for B-BOP, including high
dynamic range polarimetric imaging of the cold interstellar medium (ISM) in both our Milky Way and
nearby galaxies. Thanks to a cooled telescope, B-BOP will deliver wide-field 100-350 micron images
of linearly polarized dust emission in Stokes Q and U with a resolution, signal-to-noise ratio,
and both intensity and spatial dynamic ranges comparable to those achieved by Herschel images of
the cold ISM in total intensity (Stokes I). The B-BOP 200 micron images will also have a factor ~30
higher resolution than Planck polarization data. This will make B-BOP a unique tool for characterizing
the statistical properties of the magnetized interstellar medium and probing the role of magnetic
fields in the formation and evolution of the interstellar web of dusty molecular filaments giving
birth to most stars in our Galaxy. B-BOP will also be a powerful instrument for studying the magnetism
of nearby galaxies and testing galactic dynamo models, constraining the physics of dust grain alignment,
informing the problem of the interaction of cosmic rays with molecular clouds, tracing magnetic
fields in the inner layers of protoplanetary disks, and monitoring accretion bursts in embedded
protostars.
