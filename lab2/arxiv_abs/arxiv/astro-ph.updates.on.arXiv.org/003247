CONTEXT: Vela X-1, a prototypical high mass X-ray binary (HMXB), hosts a neutron star (NS) in a close
orbit around an early B-supergiant donor star. Accretion of the donor star's wind onto the NS powers
its strong X-ray luminosity. To understand the physics of HMXBs, detailed knowledge about the donor
star winds is required. AIMS: To gain a realistic picture of the donor star in Vela X-1, we construct
a hydrodynamically consistent atmosphere model describing the wind stratification while properly
reproducing the observed donor spectrum. To investigate how X-ray illumination affects the stellar
wind, we calculate additional models for different X-ray luminosity regimes. METHODS: We use the
recently updated version of the PoWR code to consistently solve the hydrodynamic equation together
with the statistical equations and the radiative transfer. RESULTS: The wind flow in Vela X-1 is
driven by ions from various elements with Fe III and S III leading in the outer wind. The model-predicted
mass-loss rate is in line with earlier empirical studies. The mass-loss rate is almost unaffected
by the presence of the accreting neutron star in the wind. The terminal wind velocity is confirmed
at $v_\infty \approx 600$ km/s. On the other hand, the wind velocity in the inner region where the
NS is located is only $\approx 100$ km/s, which is not expected on the basis of a standard $\beta$-velocity
law. In models with an enhanced level of X-rays, the velocity field in the outer wind can be altered.
If the X-ray flux is too high, the acceleration breaks down due increased ionization. CONCLUSIONS:
Accounting for radiation hydrodynamics, our Vela X-1 donor atmosphere model reveals a low wind
speed at the NS location, and provides quantitative information on wind driving in this important
HMXB.
