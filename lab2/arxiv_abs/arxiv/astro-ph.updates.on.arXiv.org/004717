We present new radio/millimeter measurements of the hot magnetic star HR5907 obtained with the
VLA and ALMA interferometers. We find that HR5907 is the most radio luminous early type star in the
cm-mm band among those presently known. Its multi-wavelength radio light curves are strongly variable
with an amplitude that increases with radio frequency. The radio emission can be explained by the
populations of the non-thermal electrons accelerated in the current sheets on the outer border
of the magnetosphere of this fast rotating magnetic star. We classify HR5907 as another member of
the growing class of strongly magnetic fast rotating hot stars where the gyro-synchrotron emission
mechanism efficiently operates in their magnetospheres. The new radio observations of HR5907
are combined with archival X-ray data to study the physical condition of its magnetosphere. The
X-ray spectra of HR5907 show tentative evidence for the presence of non-thermal spectral component.
We suggest that non-thermal X-rays originate a stellar X-ray aurora due to streams of non-thermal
electrons impacting on the stellar surface. Taking advantage of the relation between the spectral
indices of the X-ray power-law spectrum and the non-thermal electron energy distributions, we
perform 3-D modeling of the radio emission for HR5907. The wavelength-dependent radio light-curves
probe magnetospheric layers at different heights above the stellar surface. A detailed comparison
between simulated and observed radio light-curves leads us to conclude that the stellar magnetic
field of HR5907 is likely non-dipolar, providing further indirect evidence of the complex magnetic
field topology of HR5907.
