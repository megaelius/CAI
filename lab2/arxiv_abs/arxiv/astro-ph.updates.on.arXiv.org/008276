Several telescopes include large Deformable Mirrors (DM) located directly inside the telescope.
These adaptive telescopes trigger new constraints for the calibration of the Adaptive Optics (AO)
systems as they usually offer no access to an artificial calibration source for the interaction
matrix measurement. Moreover, the optical propagation between the DM and the Wave-Front Sensor
(WFS) may evolve during the operation, resulting in mis-registrations that highly affect the AO
performance and thus the scientific observation. They have to be measured and compensated, for
instance by updating the calibration. A new strategy consists of estimating the mis-registrations
and injecting them into synthetic models to generate noise-free interaction matrices. This pseudo-synthetic
approach is the baseline for the Adaptive Optics Facility working with a Shack-Hartmann WFS and
seems particularly suited for the future Extremely Large Telescope as the calibration will have
to be regularly updated, for a large numbers of actuators. In this paper, the feasibility of a pseudo
synthetic calibration with Pyramid WFS at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) is investigated.
A synthetic model of the LBT AO systems is developed, and the procedure to adjust the mis-registrations
parameters is introduced, extracting them from an experimental interaction matrix. We successfully
tested an interaction matrix generated from the model on the real system in high-order AO mode. We
recorded a slightly better performance with respect to the experimental one. This work demonstrates
that a high accuracy calibration can be obtained using the pseudo synthetic approach with pyramid
WFS.
