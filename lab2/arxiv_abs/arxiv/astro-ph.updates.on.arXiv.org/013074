Quickly growing computing facilities and an increasing number of extragalactic observations
encourage the application of data-driven approaches to uncover hidden relations from astronomical
data. In this work we raise the problem of distance reconstruction for a large number of galaxies
from available extensive observations. We propose a new data-driven approach for computing distance
moduli for local galaxies based on the machine-learning regression as an alternative to physically
oriented methods. We use key observable parameters for a large number of galaxies as input explanatory
variables for training: magnitudes in U, B, I, and K bands, corresponding colour indices, surface
brightness, angular size, radial velocity, and coordinates. We performed detailed tests of the
five machine-learning regression techniques for inference of $m-M$: linear, polynomial, k-nearest
neighbours, gradient boosting, and artificial neural network regression. As a test set we selected
91 760 galaxies at $z<0.2$ from the NASA/IPAC extragalactic database with distance moduli measured
by different independent redshift methods. We find that the most effective and precise is the neural
network regression model with two hidden layers. The obtained root-mean-square error of 0.35 mag,
which corresponds to a relative error of 16\%, does not depend on the distance to galaxy and is comparable
with methods based on the Tully-Fisher and Fundamental Plane relations. The proposed model shows
a 0.44 mag (20\%) error in the case of spectroscopic redshift absence and is complementary to existing
photometric redshift methodologies. Our approach has great potential for obtaining distance
moduli for around 250 000 galaxies at $z<0.2$ for which the above-mentioned parameters are already
observed.
