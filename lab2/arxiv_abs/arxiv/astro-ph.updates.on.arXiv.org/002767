Kepler ultra-high precision photometry of long and continuous observations provides a unique
dataset in which surface rotation and variability can be studied for thousands of stars. Because
many of these old field stars also have independently measured asteroseismic ages, measurements
of rotation and activity are particularly interesting in the context of age-rotation-activity
relations. In particular, age-rotation relations generally lack good calibrators at old ages,
a problem that this Kepler sample of old-field stars is uniquely suited to address. We study the surface
rotation and photometric magnetic activity of a subset of 540 solar-like stars on the main- sequence
and the subgiant branch for which stellar pulsations have been measured. The rotation period was
determined by comparing the results from two different analysis methods: i) the projection onto
the frequency domain of the time-period analysis, and ii) the autocorrelation function (ACF) of
the light curves. Reliable surface rotation rates were then extracted by comparing the results
from two different sets of calibrated data and from the two complementary analyses. We report rotation
periods for 310 out of 540 targets (excluding known binaries and candidate planet-host stars);
our measurements span a range of 1 to 100 days. The photometric magnetic activity levels of these
stars were computed, and for 61.5% of the dwarfs, this level is similar to the range, from minimum
to maximum, of the solar magnetic activity. We demonstrate that hot dwarfs, cool dwarfs, and subgiants
have very different rotation-age relationships, highlighting the importance of separating out
distinct populations when interpreting stellar rotation periods. Our sample of cool dwarf stars
with age and metallicity data of the highest quality is consistent with gyrochronology relations
reported in the literature.
