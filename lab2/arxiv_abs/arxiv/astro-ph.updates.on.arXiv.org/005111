The abundance and spatial distribution of dwarf galaxies are excellent empirical benchmarks to
test models of structure formation on small scales. The nearby Centaurus group, with its two subgroups
centered on CenA and M83, stands out as an important alternative to the Local Group for scrutinizing
cosmological model predictions in a group of galaxies context. We have obtained deep optical images
of three recently discovered M83 satellite galaxy candidates with the FORS2 instrument mounted
on the Very Large Telescope. We aim to confirm their group membership and study their stellar population.
Deep VI-band photometry is used to resolve the brightest stars in our targets. Artificial star tests
are performed to estimate the completeness and uncertainties of the photometry. The color-magnitude
diagrams reveal the red giant branch (RGB) stars allowing to use the Sobel edge detection method
to measure the magnitude of the RGB tip and thus derive distances and group membership for our targets.
The mean metallicity of the dwarf galaxies are further determined by fitting BASTI model isochrones
to the mean RGB locus. We confirm the two candidates, dw1335-29 and dw1340-30, to be dwarf satellites
of the M83 subgroup, with estimated distances of 5.03 +- 0.24 Mpc and 5.06 +- 0.24 Mpc, respectively.
Their respective mean metallicities of <[Fe/H]> = -1.79 +- 0.4 and <[Fe/H]> = -2.27 +- 0.4 are consistent
with the metallicity-luminosity relation for dwarf galaxies. The third candidate, dw1325-33,
could not be resolved into stars due to insufficiently deep images, implying its distance must be
larger than 5.3 Mpc. Using the two newly derived distances we assess the spatial distribution of
the galaxies in the M83 subgroup and discuss a potential plane-ofsatellites around M83.
