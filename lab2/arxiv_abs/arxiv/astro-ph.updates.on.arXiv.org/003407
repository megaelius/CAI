Transmission spectra of exoplanetary atmospheres have been used to infer the presence of clouds/hazes.
Such inferences are typically based on spectral slopes in the optical deviant from gaseous Rayleigh
scattering or low-amplitude spectral features in the infrared. We investigate three observable
metrics that could allow constraints on cloud properties from transmission spectra, namely, the
optical slope, the uniformity of this slope, and condensate features in the infrared. We derive
these metrics using model transmission spectra considering Mie extinction from a wide range of
condensate species, particle sizes, and scale heights. Firstly, we investigate possible degeneracies
among the cloud properties for an observed slope. We find, for example, that spectra with very steep
optical slopes suggest sulphide clouds (e.g. MnS, ZnS, Na$_2$S) in the atmospheres. Secondly,
(non)uniformities in optical slopes provide additional constraints on cloud properties, e.g.,
MnS, ZnS, TiO$_2$, and Fe$_2$O$_3$ have significantly non-uniform slopes. Thirdly, infrared
spectra provide an additional powerful probe into cloud properties, with SiO$_2$, Fe$_2$O$_3$,
Mg$_2$SiO$_4$, and MgSiO$_3$ bearing strong infrared features observable with the James Webb
Space Telescope. We investigate observed spectra of eight hot Jupiters and discuss their implications.
In particular, no single or composite condensate species considered here conforms to the steep
and non-uniform optical slope observed for HD 189733b. Our work highlights the importance of the
three above metrics to investigate cloud properties in exoplanetary atmospheres using high-precision
transmission spectra and detailed cloud models. We make our Mie scattering data for condensates
publicly available to the community.
