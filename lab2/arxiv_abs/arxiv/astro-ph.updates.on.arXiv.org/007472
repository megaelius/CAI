Using deep and high-cadence gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow data from RATIR, we observe a sharp
and achromatic light curve break 12.6 days after the GRB, accompanied by an approximately achromatic
bump. Fitting of the optical, NIR, and X-ray data suggest a very narrow (2 degree) jet which remains
collimated at late-time. We argue that the sharp light curve bump suggests an edge brightened jet,
perhaps emitting only during a brief period of lateral jet expansion. The lightcurve also exhibits
a gradual cooling transition lasting $>10$ days, well-fitted by a wavelength-dependent temporal
decay index $\alpha = 0.94 - 0.2\log(\lambda/[980~{\rm nm}])$. The gradual color evolution (i.e.
with no cooling breaks) is different from that predicted by simplistic cooling models, which predict
both distinct temporal and spectral breaks.Using deep and high-cadence gamma-ray burst (GRB)
