Near-infrared polarimetric imaging observations toward the Galactic center have been carried
out to examine the efficiency and wavelength dependence of interstellar polarization. A total
area of about 5.7 deg$^2$ is covered in the $J$, $H$, and $K_S$ bands. We examined the polarization
efficiency, defined as the ratio of degree of polarization to color excess. The interstellar medium
between the Galactic center and us shows the polarization efficiency lower than that in the Galactic
disk by a factor of three. Moreover we investigated the spatial variation of the polarization efficiency
by comparing it with those of color excess, degree of polarization, and position angle. The spatial
variations of color excess and degree of polarization depend on the Galactic latitude, while the
polarization efficiency varies independently of the Galactic structure. Position angles are
nearly parallel to the Galactic plane, indicating the longitudinal magnetic field configuration
between the Galactic center and us. The polarization efficiency anticorrelates with dispersions
of position angles. The low polarization efficiency and its spatial variation can be explained
by the differences of the magnetic field directions along the line-of-sight. From the lower polarization
efficiency, we suggest a higher strength of a random component relative to a uniform component of
the magnetic field between the Galactic center and us. We also derived the ratios of degree of polarization
$p_H/p_J$ = 0.581 $\pm$ 0.004 and $p_{K_S}/p_H$ = 0.620 $\pm$ 0.002. The power law indices of the
wavelength dependence of polarization are $\beta_{JH}$ = 2.08 $\pm$ 0.02 and $\beta_{HK_S}$ =
1.76 $\pm$ 0.01. Therefore the wavelength dependence of interstellar polarization exhibits flattening
toward longer wavelengths in the range of 1.25$-$2.14 $\micron$. The flattening would be caused
by aligned large-size dust grains.
