We report time-resolved, high-resolution optical spectropolarimetric observations of the young
double-lined spectroscopic binary V1878 Ori. Our observations were collected with the ESPaDOnS
spectropolarimeter at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope through the BinaMIcS large programme.
V1878 Ori A and B are partially convective intermediate mass weak-line T Tauri stars on an eccentric
and asynchronous orbit. We also acquired X-ray observations at periastron and outside periastron.
Using the least-squares deconvolution technique (LSD) to combine information from many spectral
lines, we clearly detected circular polarization signals in both components throughout the orbit.
We refined the orbital solution for the system and obtained disentangled spectra for the primary
and secondary components. The disentangled spectra were then employed to determine atmospheric
parameters of the two components using spectrum synthesis. Applying our Zeeman Doppler imaging
code to composite Stokes $IV$ LSD profiles, we reconstructed brightness maps and the global magnetic
field topologies of the two components. We find that V1878 Ori A and B have strikingly different global
magnetic field topologies and mean field strengths. The global magnetic field of the primary is
predominantly poloidal and non-axisymmetric (with a mean field strength of 180 G). while the secondary
has a mostly toroidal and axisymmetric global field (mean strength of 310 G). These findings confirm
that stars with very similar parameters can exhibit radically different global magnetic field
characteristics. The analysis of the X-ray data shows no sign of enhanced activity at periastron,
suggesting the lack of strong magnetospheric interaction at this epoch.
