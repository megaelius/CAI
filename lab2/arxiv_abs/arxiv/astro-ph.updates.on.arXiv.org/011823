We study the synchrotron radio emission from extra-planar regions of star forming galaxies. We
use ideal magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of a rotating Milky Way-type disk galaxy with
distributed star formation sites for three star formation rates (SFRs) (0.3, 3, 30 M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$). From our simulations, we see emergence of galactic-scale magnetised outflows, carrying
gas from the disk. We compare the morphology of the outflowing gas with hydrodynamic (HD) simulations.
We look at the spatial distribution of magnetic field in the outflows. Assuming that a certain fraction
of gas energy density is converted into cosmic ray energy density, and using information about the
magnetic field, we obtain synchrotron emissivity throughout the simulation domain. We generate
the surface brightness maps at a frequency of 1.4 GHz. The outflows are more extended in the vertical
direction than radial and hence have an oblate shape. We further find that the matter right behind
the outer shock, shines brighter in these maps than that above or below. To understand whether this
feature can be observed, we produce vertical intensity profiles. We convolve the vertical intensity
profile with the typical beam sizes of radio telescopes, for a galaxy located at 10 Mpc (similar to
NGC 891) in order to estimate the radio scale height to compare with observations. We find that for
our SFRs this feature will lie below the RMS noise limit of instruments. The radio scale height is
found to be $\sim 300-1200$ pc , depending on the resolution of the telescope. We relate the advection
speed of the outer shock with the surface density of star formation as $\rm{v}_{\rm adv} \propto
\Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{0.3}$ which is consistent with earlier observations and analytical estimates.
