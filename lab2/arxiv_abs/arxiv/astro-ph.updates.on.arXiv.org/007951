Feedback from accreting supermassive black holes, active galactic nuclei (AGN), is now a cornerstone
of galaxy formation models. In this work, we present radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of radiative
AGN feedback using the novel Arepo-RT. A central black hole emits radiation at a constant luminosity
and drives an outflow via radiation pressure on dust grains. Utilising an isolated NFW halo we validate
our setup in the single and multi-scattering regimes, with the simulated shock front propagation
in excellent agreement with the expected analytic result. For a spherically symmetric NFW halo,
an examination of the simulated outflow properties generated by radiative feedback demonstrates
that they are lower than typically observed at a fixed AGN luminosity, regardless of the collimation
of the radiation. We then explore the impact of a central disc galaxy and the assumed dust model on
the outflow properties. The contraction of the halo during the galaxy's formation and modelling
the production of dust grains results in a factor $100$ increase in the halo's optical depth. Radiation
is then able to couple momentum more efficiently to the gas, driving a stronger shock and producing
a mass-loaded $\sim10^{3}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ outflow with a velocity
of $\sim2000\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, in agreement with observations. However, the
inclusion of dust destruction mechanisms, like thermal sputtering, leads to the rapid destruction
of dust grains within the outflow, reducing its properties below typically observed values. We
conclude that radiative AGN feedback can drive outflows, but a thorough numerical and physical
treatment is required to assess its true impact.
