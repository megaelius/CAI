We present an open-access database which includes a synthetic catalog of black holes in the Milky
Way. To calculate evolution of single and binary star we used updated population synthesis code
StarTrack. We applied a new model of star formation history and chemical evolution of Galactic disk,
bulge and halo synthesized from observational and theoretical data. We find that at the current
moment Milky Way (disk+bulge+halo) contains about 1.6 x 10^8 single black holes with average mass
of about 13 Msun and 9.3 x 10^6 BHs in binary systems with average mass of 19 Msun. We present basic statistical
properties of BH populations such as distributions of single and binary BH masses, velocities or
numbers of BH binary systems in different evolutionary configurations. We find that the most massive
BHs are formed in mergers of binary stars and BH-BH systems. The metallicity of stellar population
has a significant impact on the final BH mass due to the stellar winds. Therefore the most massive
single BH in our simulation, 130 Msun, originates from a merger of main sequence and helium star in
a low metallicity stellar environment in Galactic halo. The most massive BH in binary system is 60
Msun and was also formed in halo. We constrain that only 0.005% of total Galactic halo mass (including
dark matter) could be hidden in the form of stellar origin BHs which are not detectable by current
observational surveys. Galactic binary BHs are minority (10% of all Galactic BHs) and most of them
are in BH-BH systems (8% of all). The current Galactic merger rates for two considered common envelope
models which are: 3-81 Myr^-1 for BH-BH, 1-9 Myr^-1, for BH-NS and 14-59 Myr^-1 for NS-NS systems.
