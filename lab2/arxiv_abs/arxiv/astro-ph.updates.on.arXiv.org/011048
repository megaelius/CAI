(Abridged) We explore the Frontier Fields cluster RXJ2248-443 at z~0.35 with VIMOS/VLT spectroscopy
from CLASH-VLT, which covers a central region corresponding to almost 2 virial radii. The fluxes
of [OII], Hbeta, [OIII], Halpha and [NII] emission lines were measured allowing the derivation
of (O/H) gas metallicities, star formation rates based on extinction-corrected Halpha fluxes
and active galactic nuclei (AGN) contamination. We compare our sample of cluster galaxies to a population
of field galaxies at similar redshifts. We use the location of galaxies in projected phase-space
to distinguish between cluster and field galaxies. Both populations follow the star-forming-sequence
in the diagnostic diagrams, which allow disentangling between the ionising sources in a galaxy,
with only few galaxies classified as Seyfert II. Both field and cluster galaxies follow the "Main-Sequence"
of star forming galaxies, with no substantial difference observed between the two populations.
In the Mass - Metallicity (MZ) plane, both high mass field and cluster galaxies show comparable (O/H)s
to the local SDSS MZ relation, with an offset of low mass galaxies towards higher metallicities.
While both the metallicities of "accreted" (R < R500) and "infalling" (R > R500) cluster members
are comparable at all masses, the cluster galaxies from the intermediate, mass complete bin show
more enhanced metallicities than their field counterparts. The intermediate mass field galaxies
are in accordance with the expected (O/H)s from the Fundamental Metallicity relation, while the
cluster members deviate strongly from the model predictions. The results of this work are in accordance
with studies of other clusters at z < 0.5 and favour the scenario in which the hot halo gas of log(M/Msun)<10.2
cluster galaxies is removed due to mild ram pressure stripping, leading to an increase in their gas-phase
metallicity.
