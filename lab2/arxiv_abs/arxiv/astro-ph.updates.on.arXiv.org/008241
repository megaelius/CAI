We present our discovery of observational evidence for the coherence between galaxy rotation and
the average line-of-sight motion of neighbors. We use the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area
(CALIFA) survey data analyzed with the Python CALIFA STARLIGHT Synthesis Organizer (PyCASSO)
platform, and the NASA-Sloan Atlas (NSA) catalog. After estimating the projected angular momentum
vectors of 445 CALIFA galaxies, we build composite maps of their neighbor galaxies on the parameter
space of line-of-sight velocity versus projected distance. The composite radial profiles of the
luminosity-weighted mean velocity of neighbors show striking evidence for dynamical coherence
between the rotational direction of the CALIFA galaxies and the average moving direction of their
neighbor galaxies. The signal of such dynamical coherence is significant for the neighbors within
800 kpc distance from the CALIFA galaxies, for which the luminosity-weighted mean velocity is as
large as 61.7+/-17.6 km/s (3.5-sigma significance to bootstrap uncertainty) when the angular
momentum is measured at R_e<R<=2R_e of each CALIFA galaxy. In the comparison of the subsamples,
we find that faint, blue or kinematically misaligned galaxies show stronger coherence with neighbor
motions than bright, red or kinematically well-aligned galaxies do. Our results indicate that
(1) the rotation of a galaxy (particularly at its outskirt) is significantly influenced by interactions
with its neighbors up to 800 kpc, (2) the coherence is particularly strong between faint galaxies
and bright neighbors, and (3) galaxy interactions often cause internal kinematic misalignment
or possibly even kinematically distinct cores.
