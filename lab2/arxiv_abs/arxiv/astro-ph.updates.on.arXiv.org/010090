We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) CO($J=2-1$) observations of
two main-sequence star-forming galaxies at $z\sim1.47$ taken from the High-Z Emission Line Survey
(HiZELS). These two systems have been previously reported to be molecular gas rich $f_{\rm H_2}
\equiv M_{\rm H_2}/(M_{\rm H_2} + M_\star) \sim 0.8$. We carried out a follow-up study to resolve,
at $\sim$kpc-scales, the CO emission. These new observations are combined with our earlier ALMA
observations (sensitive to diffuse CO emission) and compared with our previous H$\alpha$-based
study at matched spatial resolution. One target is marginally resolved in CO(2-1), showing complex
dynamics with respect to the ionised gas traced by H$\alpha$. While the other source is spatially
resolved, enabling a detailed exploration of its internal dynamical properties. In this system,
both gaseous phases show similar spatial extension, rotation velocities and velocity dispersions
($V_{\rm rot} \sim \sigma_v \sim 100$\,km\,s$^{-1}$) suggesting a rotational velocity to velocity
dispersion ratio consistent with unity. By comparing the ionized and molecular gas tracers through
the use of a two-dimensional kinematic model, we estimate a median depletion time $\tau_{\rm dep}=2.3
\pm 1.2$\,Gyr for the galaxy as a whole. This value is in agreement with the average $\tau_{\rm dep}$
value observed in local star-forming galaxies at similar spatial scales. Using a thick-disk dynamical
modelling, we derive a dynamical mass $M_{\rm dyn} = (1.59\pm0.19) \times 10^{11}$\,$M_\odot$
within $\approx 6$\,kpc. This suggests a dark matter fraction ($f_{\rm DM} \equiv M_{\rm DM}/M_{\rm
dyn}$) of $0.59\pm0.10$, in agreement with the average $f_{\rm DM}$ value derived from stacked
rotation curve analysis of galaxies at similar redshift range.
