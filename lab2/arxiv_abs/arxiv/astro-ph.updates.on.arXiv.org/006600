The favored progenitor model for Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) with Supernova (SN) association is the
core collapse of massive stars. One possible outcome of such a collapse is a rapidly spinning, strongly
magnetized neutron star ("magnetar"). We systematically analyze the multi-wavelength data of
GRB/SN associations detected by several instruments before 2017 June. Twenty GRB/SN systems have
been confirmed via direct spectroscopic evidence or a clear light curve bump, as well as some spectroscopic
evidence resembling a GRB-SN. We derive/collect the basic physical parameters of the GRBs and the
SNe, and look for correlations among these parameters. We find that the peak brightness, $\rm ^{56}Ni$
mass, and explosion energy of SNe associated with GRBs are statistically higher than other Type
Ib/c SNe. A statistically significant relation between the peak energy of GRBs and the peak brightness
of their associated SNe is confirmed. No significant correlations are found between the GRB energies
(either isotropic or beaming-corrected) and the supernova energy. We investigate the energy partition
within these systems and find that the beaming-corrected GRB energy of most systems is smaller than
the SN energy, with less than 30\% of the total energy distributed in the relativistic jet. The total
energy of the systems is typically smaller than the maximum available energy of a millisecond magnetar
($2\times 10^{52}$ erg), especially if aspherical SN explosions are considered. The data are consistent
with-though not a proof of-the hypothesis that most, but not all, GRB/SN systems are powered by millisecond
magnetars.
