Traditional cosmological hydrodynamics simulations fail to spatially resolve the circumgalatic
medium (CGM), the reservoir of tenuous gas surrounding a galaxy and extending to its virial radius.
We introduce the technique of Enhanced Halo Resolution (EHR), enabling more realistic physical
modeling of the simulated CGM by consistently forcing gas refinement to smaller scales throughout
the virial halo of a simulated galaxy. We investigate the effects of EHR in the Tempest simulations,
a suite of Enzo-based cosmological zoom simulations following the evolution of an L* galaxy, resolving
spatial scales of 500 comoving pc out to 100 comoving kpc in galactocentric radius. Among its many
effects, EHR (1) changes the thermal balance of the CGM, increasing its cool gas content and decreasing
its warm/hot gas content; (2) preserves cool gas structures for longer periods; and (3) enables
these cool clouds to exist at progressively smaller size scales. Observationally, this results
in a boost in "low ions" like H I and a drop in "high ions" like O VI throughout the CGM. These effects
of EHR do not converge in the Tempest simulations, but extrapolating these trends suggests that
the CGM in reality is a mist consisting of ubiquitous, small, long-lived, cool clouds suspended
in a hot medium at the virial temperature of the halo. Additionally, we explore the physical mechanisms
to explain why EHR produces the above effects, proposing that it works both by (1) better sampling
the distribution of CGM phases enabling runaway cooling in the denser, cooler tail of the phase distribution;
and (2) preventing cool gas clouds from artificially mixing with the ambient hot halo and evaporating.
Evidence is found for both EHR mechanisms occurring in the Tempest simulations.
