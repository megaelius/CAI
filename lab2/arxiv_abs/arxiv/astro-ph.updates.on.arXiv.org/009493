Massive stars of helium cores of 35-65 Msun eventually encounter the electron/positron creation
instability, and it triggers explosive carbon or oxygen burning that produces several thermonuclear
eruptions. The resulting catastrophe collisions of eruptive shells sometimes produce luminous
transients with peak luminosity of $10^{43} - 10^{44}$ erg/sec, known as pulsational pair-instability
supernovae (PPISNe). Previous 2D simulations of colliding shells show the development of Rayleigh-Taylor
(RT) instabilities and mixing. Here we present radiation hydrodynamic PPISNe simulations of a
110 Msun solar-metallicity star that was promising to produce a superluminous transit in the early
work. Our comprehensive study contains a suite of one-, two-, and three-dimensional models. We
discuss the impact of dimensionality and fluid instabilities on the resulting light curves. The
results show the RT mixing found in previous multidimensional hydro studies transforms into a thin
and distorted shell due to radiative cooling. Radiation from the wiggly shell peaks at its bolometric
light curve of $\sim 2\times10^{43}$ erg/sec, lasting about 150 days and following with a plateau
of $\sim 3\times10^{42}$ erg/sec for another two hundred days before it fades away. The total radiation
energy emitted from colliding shells is $\sim 1.8 \times 10^{50}$ erg, which is $\sim 27\%$ of the
kinetic energy of the major eruption. The dimensional effects also manifest on the physical properties,
such as irregularity and thickness of the shell. Our study suggests PPISNe is a promising candidate
of luminous SNe, the radiation of which originates from colliding shells with a homogeneous mixing
of ejecta.
