Galaxy metallicity scaling relations provide a powerful tool for understanding galaxy evolution,
but obtaining unbiased global galaxy gas-phase oxygen abundances requires proper treatment of
the various line-emitting sources within spectroscopic apertures. We present a model framework
that treats galaxies as ensembles of HII and diffuse ionized gas (DIG) regions of varying metallicities.
These models are based upon empirical relations between line ratios and electron temperature for
HII regions, and DIG strong-line ratio relations from SDSS-IV MaNGA IFU data. Flux-weighting effects
and DIG contamination can significantly affect properties inferred from global galaxy spectra,
biasing metallicity estimates by more than 0.3 dex in some cases. We use observationally-motivated
inputs to construct a model matched to typical local star-forming galaxies, and quantify the biases
in strong-line ratios, electron temperatures, and direct-method metallicities as inferred from
global galaxy spectra relative to the median values of the HII region distributions in each galaxy.
We also provide a generalized set of models that can be applied to individual galaxies or galaxy samples
in atypical regions of parameter space. We use these models to correct for the effects of flux-weighting
and DIG contamination in the local direct-method mass-metallicity and fundamental metallicity
relations, and in the mass-metallicity relation based on strong-line metallicities. Future photoionization
models of galaxy line emission need to include DIG emission and represent galaxies as ensembles
of emitting regions with varying metallicity, instead of as single HII regions with effective properties,
in order to obtain unbiased estimates of key underlying physical properties.
