The impact of nuclear physics uncertainties on nucleosynthesis in thermonuclear supernovae has
not been fully explored using comprehensive and systematic studies with multiple models. To better
constrain predictions of yields from these phenomena, we have performed a sensitivity study by
post-processing thermodynamic histories from two different hydrodynamic, Chandrasekhar-mass
explosion models. We have individually varied all input reaction and, for the first time, weak interaction
rates by a factor of ten and compared the yields in each case to yields using standard rates. Of the
2305 nuclear reactions in our network, we find that the rates of only 53 reactions affect the yield
of any species with an abundance of at least 10^-8 M_sun by at least a factor of two, in either model.
The rates of the 12C(a,g), 12C+12C, 20Ne(a,p), 20Ne(a,g) and 30Si(p,g) reactions are among those
that modify the most yields when varied by a factor of ten. From the individual variation of 658 weak
interaction rates in our network by a factor of ten, only the stellar 28Si(b+)28Al, 32S(b+)32P and
36Ar(b+)36Cl rates significantly affect the yields of species in a model. Additional tests reveal
that reaction rate changes over temperatures T > 1.5 GK have the greatest impact, and that ratios
of radionuclides that may be used as explosion diagnostics change by a factor of less than two from
the variation of individual rates by a factor of 10. Nucleosynthesis in the two adopted models is
relatively robust to variations in individual nuclear reaction and weak interaction rates. Laboratory
measurements of a limited number of reactions would help to further constrain predictions. As well,
we confirm the need for a consistent treatment for relevant stellar weak interaction rates since
simultaneous variation of these rates (as opposed to individual variation) has a significant effect
on yields in our models.
