Despite decades of inquiry, the origin of giant planets residing within a few tenths of an astronomical
unit from their host stars remains unclear. Traditionally, these objects are thought to have formed
further out before subsequently migrating inwards. However, the necessity of migration has been
recently called into question with the emergence of in-situ formation models of close-in giant
planets. Observational characterization of the transiting sub-sample of close-in giants has
revealed that "warm" Jupiters, possessing orbital periods longer than roughly 10 days more often
possess close-in, co-transiting planetary companions than shorter period "hot" Jupiters, that
are usually lonely. This finding has previously been interpreted as evidence that smooth, early
migration or in situ formation gave rise to warm Jupiter-hosting systems, whereas more violent,
post-disk migration pathways sculpted hot Jupiter-hosting systems. In this work, we demonstrate
that both classes of planet may arise via early migration or in-situ conglomeration, but that the
enhanced loneliness of hot Jupiters arises due to a secular resonant interaction with the stellar
quadrupole moment. Such an interaction tilts the orbits of exterior, lower mass planets, removing
them from transit surveys where the hot Jupiter is detected. Warm Jupiter-hosting systems, in contrast,
retain their coplanarity due to the weaker influence of the host star's quadrupolar potential relative
to planet-disk interactions. In this way, hot Jupiters and warm Jupiters are placed within a unified
theoretical framework that may be readily validated or falsified using data from upcoming missions
such as TESS.
