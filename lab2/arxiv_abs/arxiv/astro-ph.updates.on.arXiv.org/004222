We present a first study of the progenitor star dependence of the three-dimensional (3D) neutrino
mechanism of core-collapse supernovae. We employ full 3D general-relativistic multi-group neutrino
radiation-hydrodynamics and simulate the post-bounce evolutions of progenitors with zero-age
main sequence masses of $12$, $15$, $20$, $27$, and $40\,M_\odot$. All progenitors, with the exception
of the $12\,M_\odot$ star, experience shock runaway by the end of their simulations. In most cases,
a strongly asymmetric explosion will result. We find three qualitatively distinct evolutions
that suggest a complex dependence of explosion dynamics on progenitor density structure, neutrino
heating, and 3D flow. (1) Progenitors with massive cores, shallow density profiles, and high post-core-bounce
accretion rates experience very strong neutrino heating and neutrino-driven turbulent convection,
leading to early shock runaway. Accretion continues at a high rate, likely leading to black hole
formation. (2) Intermediate progenitors experience neutrino-driven, turbulence-aided explosions
triggered by the arrival of density discontinuities at the shock. These occur typically at the silicon/silicon-oxygen
shell boundary. (3) Progenitors with small cores and density profiles without strong discontinuities
experience shock recession and develop the 3D standing-accretion shock instability (SASI). Shock
runaway ensues late, once declining accretion rate, SASI, and neutrino-driven convection create
favorable conditions. These differences in explosion times and dynamics result in a non-monotonic
relationship between progenitor and compact remnant mass.
