Although chemical models predict that the deuterium fractionation in N$_2$H$^+$ is a good evolutionary
tracer in the star formation process, the fractionation of nitrogen is still a poorly understood
process. Recent models have questioned the similar evolutionary trend expected for the two fractionation
mechanisms in N$_2$H$^+$, based on a classical scenario in which ion-neutral reactions occurring
in cold gas should have caused an enhancement of the abundance of N$_2$D$^+$, $^{15}$NNH$^+$, and
N$^{15}$NH$^+$. In the framework of the ASAI IRAM-30m large program, we have investigated the fractionation
of deuterium and $^{15}$N in N$_2$H$^+$ in the best known representatives of the different evolutionary
stages of the Sun-like star formation process. The goal is to ultimately confirm (or deny) the classical
"ion-neutral reactions" scenario that predicts a similar trend for D and $^{15}$N fractionation.
We do not find any evolutionary trend of the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio from both the $^{15}$NNH$^+$
and N$^{15}$NH$^+$ isotopologues. Therefore, our findings confirm that, during the formation
of a Sun-like star, the core evolution is irrelevant in the fractionation of $^{15}$N. The independence
of the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio with time, found also in high-mass star-forming cores, indicates
that the enrichment in $^{15}$N revealed in comets and protoplanetary disks is unlikely to happen
at core scales. Nevertheless, we have firmly confirmed the evolutionary trend expected for the
H/D ratio, with the N$_2$H$^+$/N$_2$D$^+$ ratio decreasing before the pre-stellar core phase,
and increasing monotonically during the protostellar phase. We have also confirmed clearly that
the two fractionation mechanisms are not related.
