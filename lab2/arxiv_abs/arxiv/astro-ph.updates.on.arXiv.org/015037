The price of instruments and observing time on modern telescopes is quickly increasing with the
size of the primary mirror. Therefore, it is worth revisiting the data reduction algorithms to extract
every bit of scientific information from observations. Echelle spectrographs are typical instruments
in high-resolution spectroscopy, but attempts to improve the wavelength coverage and versatility
of these instruments results in a complicated and variable footprint of the entrance slit projection
onto the science detector. Traditional spectral extraction methods fail to perform a truly optimal
extraction, when the slit image is not aligned with the detector columns but instead is tilted or
even curved. We here present the mathematical algorithms and examples of their application to the
optimal extraction and the following reduction steps for echelle spectrometers equipped with
an entrance slit, that is imaged with various distortions, such as variable tilt and curvature.
The new method minimizes the loss of spectral resolution, maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio,
and efficiently identifies local outliers. In addition to the new optimal extraction we present
order splicing and a more robust continuum normalization algorithms. We have developed and implemented
new algorithms that create a continuum-normalized spectrum. In the process we account for the (variable)
tilt/curvature of the slit image on the detector and achieve optimal extraction without prior assumptions
about the slit illumination. Thus the new method can handle arbitrary image slicers, slit scanning,
and other observational techniques aimed at increasing the throughput or dynamic range. We compare
our methods with other techniques for different instruments to illustrate superior performance
of the new algorithms compared to commonly used procedures.
