This paper provides an update of our previous scaling relations (Genzel et al.2015) between galaxy
integrated molecular gas masses, stellar masses and star formation rates, in the framework of the
star formation main-sequence (MS), with the main goal to test for possible systematic effects.
For this purpose our new study combines three independent methods of determining molecular gas
masses from CO line fluxes, far-infrared dust spectral energy distributions, and ~1mm dust photometry,
in a large sample of 1444 star forming galaxies (SFGs) between z=0 and 4. The sample covers the stellar
mass range log(M*/M_solar)=9.0-11.8, and star formation rates relative to that on the MS, delta_MS=SFR/SFR(MS),
from 10^{-1.3} to 10^{2.2}. Our most important finding is that all data sets, despite the different
techniques and analysis methods used, follow the same scaling trends, once method-to-method zero
point offsets are minimized and uncertainties are properly taken into account. The molecular gas
depletion time t_depl, defined as the ratio of molecular gas mass to star formation rate, scales
as (1+z)^{-0.6}x(delta_MS)^{-0.44}, and is only weakly dependent on stellar mass. The ratio of
molecular-to-stellar mass mu_gas depends on (1+z)^{2.5}x (delta_MS)^{0.52}x(M*)^{-0.36},
which tracks the evolution of the specific star formation rate. The redshift dependence of mu_gas
requires a curvature term, as may the mass-dependences of t_depl and mu_gas. We find no or only weak
correlations of t_depl and mu_gas with optical size R or surface density once one removes the above
scalings, but we caution that optical sizes may not be appropriate for the high gas and dust columns
at high-z.
