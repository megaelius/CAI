In order to investigate the origin of multiple stellar populations found in globular clusters (GCs)
in the halo and bulge of the Milky Way, we have constructed chemical evolution models for their putative
low-mass progenitors. In light of recent theoretical developments, we assume that supernova blast
waves undergo blowout without expelling the pre-enriched ambient gas, while relatively slow winds
of massive stars, together with the winds and ejecta from low to high mass asymptotic-giant-branch
stars, are all locally retained in these less massive systems. Interestingly, we find that the observed
Na-O anti-correlations in metal-poor GCs can be reproduced when multiple episodes of starburst
and enrichment are allowed to continue in these subsystems. A specific form of star formation history
with decreasing time intervals between the successive stellar generations, however, is required
to obtain this result, which is in good agreement with the parameters obtained from synthetic horizontal-branch
models. The "mass budget problem" is also much alleviated by our models without ad-hoc assumptions
on star formation efficiency, initial mass function, and the preferential loss of first-generation
stars. We also applied these models to investigate the origin of super-He-rich red clump stars in
the metal-rich bulge suggested by Lee et al. (2015). We find that chemical enrichment by the winds
of massive stars can naturally reproduce the required strong He enhancement in metal-rich subsystems.
Our results further underscore that gas expulsion or retention is a key factor in understanding
the multiple populations in GCs.
