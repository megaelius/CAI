We highlight the power of the Gaia DR2 in studying many fine structures of the Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram (HRD). Gaia allows us to present many different HRDs, depending in particular on stellar
population selections. We do not aim here for completeness in terms of types of stars or stellar evolutionary
aspects. Instead, we have chosen several illustrative examples. We describe some of the selections
that can be made in Gaia DR2 to highlight the main structures of the Gaia HRDs. We select both field
and cluster (open and globular) stars, compare the observations with previous classifications
and with stellar evolutionary tracks, and we present variations of the Gaia HRD with age, metallicity,
and kinematics. Late stages of stellar evolution such as hot subdwarfs, post-AGB stars, planetary
nebulae, and white dwarfs are also analysed, as well as low-mass brown dwarf objects. The Gaia HRDs
are unprecedented in both precision and coverage of the various Milky Way stellar populations and
stellar evolutionary phases. Many fine structures of the HRDs are presented. The clear split of
the white dwarf sequence into hydrogen and helium white dwarfs is presented for the first time in
an HRD. The relation between kinematics and the HRD is nicely illustrated. Two different populations
in a classical kinematic selection of the halo are unambiguously identified in the HRD. Membership
and mean parameters for a selected list of open clusters are provided. They allow drawing very detailed
cluster sequences, highlighting fine structures, and providing extremely precise empirical
isochrones that will lead to more insight in stellar physics. Gaia DR2 demonstrates the potential
of combining precise astrometry and photometry for large samples for studies in stellar evolution
and stellar population and opens an entire new area for HRD-based studies.
