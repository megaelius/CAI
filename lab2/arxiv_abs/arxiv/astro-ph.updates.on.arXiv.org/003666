We report the characterization of the first $62$ MaNGA Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) hosts in the
Fifth Product Launch (MPL-5) and the definition of a control sample of non-active galaxies. This
control sample - comprising two galaxies for each AGN - was selected in order to match the AGN hosts
in terms of stellar mass, redshift, visual morphology and inclination. The stellar masses are in
the range $9.4<\log(M/M_\odot)<11.5$, and most objects have redshifts $\leq 0.08$. The AGN sample
is mostly comprised of low-luminosity AGN, with only 17 nuclei with $L([OIII]\lambda 5007)\geq
3.8\times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (that we call "strong AGN"). The stellar population of the control
sample galaxies within the inner $1$-$3$ kpc is dominated by the old ($\sim$ $4$ - $13$ Gyr) age component,
with a small contribution of intermediate age ($\sim 640$-$940$ Myr) and young stars ($\leq 40$
Myr) to the total light at $5700\AA$. While the weaker AGN show a similar age distribution to that
of the control galaxies, the strong AGN show an increased contribution of younger stars and a decreased
contribution of older stars. Examining the relationship between the AGN stellar population properties
and $L([OIII])$, we find that with increasing $L([OIII])$, the AGN exhibit a decreasing contribution
from the oldest ($>4$ Gyr) stellar population relative to control galaxies, but have an increasing
contribution from the younger components with ages $\sim 40$ Myr. We also find a correlation of the
mean age differences (AGN - control) with $L([OIII])$, in the sense that more luminous AGN are younger
than the control objects, while the low-luminosity AGN seem to be older. These results support a
connection between the growth of the galaxy bulge via formation of new stars and the growth of the
Supermassive Black Hole via matter accretion in the AGN phase.
