We examine the absorption line spectra of a sample of 31 luminous (M_UV~-23) Lyman break galaxies
at redshift z~6 using data taken with the FOCAS and OSIRIS spectrographs on the Subaru and GTC telescopes.
For two of these sources we present longer exposure data taken at higher spectral resolution from
ESO's X-shooter spectrograph. Using these data, we demonstrate the practicality of stacking our
lower resolution data to measure the depth of various interstellar and stellar absorption lines
to probe the covering fraction of low ionization gas and the gas-phase and stellar metallicities
near the end of the era of cosmic reionization. From maximum absorption line depths of SiII1260 and
CII1334, we infer a mean covering fraction of >0.85 +/-0.16 for our sample. This is larger than that
determined using similar methods for lower luminosity galaxies at slightly lower redshifts, suggesting
luminous galaxies do not play a prominent role in concluding reionization. Using various interstellar
absorption lines we deduce gas-phase metallicities close to solar indicative of substantial early
enrichment. Using selected stellar absorption lines, we model our spectra with a range of metallicities
using techniques successfully employed at lower redshift and deduce a stellar metallicity of 0.4
+0.3/-0.1 solar, consistent with the stellar mass - stellar metallicity relation recently found
at z~3-5. We discuss the implications of these metallicity estimates for the typical ages of our
luminous galaxies and conclude our results imply initial star formation at redshifts z~10, consistent
with independent analyses of earlier objects.
