We present H$\alpha$ spectroscopic observations and detailed modelling of the Balmer filaments
in the supernova remnant Tycho. We used Galaxy H$\alpha$ Fabry-P\'erot Spectrometer on the William
Herschel Telescope with a 3.4'$\times$3.4' field-of-view, 0.2" pixel scale and $\sigma_\rm{instr}=8.1$
km/s resolution at 1" seeing for $\sim10$ hours, resulting in 82 spatial-spectral bins that resolve
the narrow H$\alpha$ line in the entire Tycho's northeastern rim. For the first time, we can mitigate
artificial line broadening from unresolved differential motion, and probe H$\alpha$ emission
parameters in varying shock and ambient medium conditions. Broad H$\alpha$ line remains unresolved
within spectral coverage of 392 km/s. We employed Bayesian inference to obtain reliable parameter
confidence intervals, and quantify the evidence for models with multiple line components. The
median H$\alpha$ narrow-line full-width at half-maximum of all bins and models is $W_\rm{NL}=(54.8\pm1.8)$
km/s at the $95\%$ confidence level, varying within [35, 72] km/s between bins and clearly broadened
compared to the intrinsic (thermal) $\approx20$ km/s. Possible line splits are accounted for,
significant in $\approx18\%$ of the filament, and presumably due to remaining projection effects.
We also find wide-spread evidence for intermediate-line emission of a broad-neutral precursor,
with median $W_\rm{IL}=(180\pm14)$ km/s ($95\%$ confidence). Finally, we present a measurement
of the remnant's systemic velocity, $V_\rm{LSR}=-34$ km/s, and map differential line-of-sight
motions. Our results confirm the existence and interplay of shock precursors in Tycho's remnant.
In particular, we show that suprathermal narrow-line emission is near-universal in Tycho and that,
in absence of an alternative explanation, collisionless supernova remnant shocks constitute
a viable acceleration source for Galactic TeV Cosmic-Ray protons.
