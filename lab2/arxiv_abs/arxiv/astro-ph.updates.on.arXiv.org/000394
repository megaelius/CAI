[abridged] The ever increasing size and complexity of data coming from simulations of cosmic structure
formation demands equally sophisticated tools for their analysis. During the past decade, the
art of object finding in these simulations has hence developed into an important discipline itself.
A multitude of codes based upon a huge variety of methods and techniques have been spawned yet the
question remained as to whether or not they will provide the same (physical) information about the
structures of interest. This concern gave rise to a series of workshops and comparison papers of
which we here present a brief summary. But we also go one step further and investigate in more detail
the (possible) origin of any deviations across finders. To this extent we decipher and discuss differences
in halo finding methods, clearly separating them from the disparity in definitions of halo properties.
We observe that different codes not only find different numbers of objects leading to a scatter of
up to 20 per cent in the halo mass and Vmax function, but also that the particulars of those objects
that are identified by all finders differ. [...] We close with a discussion of the relevance and implications
of the scatter across different codes for other fields such as semi-analytical galaxy formation
models, gravitational lensing, and observables in general. In summary we conclude that while the
majority of codes give results with a scatter below 1 per cent (at least for the most basic halo properties)
once a particular definition has been specified, the residual differences for more complex quantities
such as spin parameter are more sensitive to the particular implementation of the initial particle
collection. We therefore caution any user of halo finders and their catalogues to not use the data
blindly but to consider the mode of operation and definitions used during its generation.
