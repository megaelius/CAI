We investigate dynamical and radiative properties of arc-shaped gas clouds falling onto a stellar
mass black hole based on the three-dimensional general relativistic radiation-magnetohydrodynamics
(3D-GRRMHD) simulation data. Assuming that the gas clouds radiate due mainly to the free-free emission
and/or optically thick, inverse Compton scattering, we calculate how the emissivity distributions
develop with time. We find that (1) gas clouds, each of which has a ring-like or arc shape, are intermittently
formed, and that (2) they slowly fall to the black hole, keeping nearly the Keplerian orbital velocity.
These features support the dynamical properties of the gas clouds assumed in the spin measurement
method proposed by Moriyama & Mineshige 2015, but the radius of the inner edge of the accretion disk
is larger than that of the marginally stable orbit (ISCO). Next, we examine how each gas cloud is observed
by a distant observer by calculating the photon trajectories in the black hole space-time. The luminosity
of the accretion flow exhibits significant time variations on different timescales, reflecting
the time evolution of the gas density distributions. The relatively slow variations on the time
durations of 0.08-0.10 sec is due to the formation and fall of gas clouds, while quasi-periodic flux
peaks with short time intervals (0.01 sec) are due to the quasi-periodic enhancement of light from
the non-axisymmetric arc-shaped clouds through the beaming effect. This may account for the high-frequency
quasi-periodic oscillations (HF QPOs) observed in black hole binaries. The observational implications
and future issues are briefly discussed.
