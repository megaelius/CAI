Using moving mesh hydrodynamic simulations, we determine the shock propagation and resulting
ground velocities for a planet hit by a high velocity impactor. We use our results to determine the
atmospheric mass loss caused by the resulting ground motion due to the impact shock wave. We find
that there are two distinct shock propagation regimes: In the limit in which the impactor is significantly
smaller than the target ($R_i<< R_t$), the solutions are self-similar and the shock velocity at
a fixed point on the target scale as $m_i^{2/3}$, where $m_i$ is the mass of the impactor, and the ground
velocities follow a universal profile given by $v_g/v_i=(14.2x^2-25.3x+11.3)/(x^2-2.5x+1.9)
+2\ln{R_i/R_t}$, where $x=\sin\left(\theta/2\right)$, $\theta$ is the latitude on the target
measured from the impact site, and $v_g$ and $v_i$ are the ground velocity and impact velocity, respectively.
In addition, we find that shock velocities decline with the mass of the impactor significantly more
weakly than $m_i^{2/3}$ in the limit in which the impactor is comparable to the size of the target
($R_i \sim R_t$). This weaker decline is due to the fact that the shock hardly decelerates when the
mass swept up by the shock is comparable to the mass of the impactor and that, in the large impactor
regime, the rarefaction wave is not able to catch up with the forward shock such that the mass contained
in the shock front is - analogous to Newton's cradle - simply the impactor mass. We use the resulting
surface velocity profiles to calculate the atmospheric mass loss for a large range of impactor masses
and impact velocities and apply them to the Kepler-36 system and the Moon forming impact. Finally,
we present and generalise our results in terms of the $v_g/v_i$ and the impactor to target size ratio
($R_i/R_t$) such that they can easily be applied to other collision scenarios.
