We present Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations of 22 GHz H$_2$O masers in the
high-mass star-forming region of \objectname{W75N}, carried out with VLBI Exploration of Radio
Astrometry (VERA) for three-epochs in 2007 with an angular resolution of $\sim$ 1 mas. We detected
H$_2$O maser emission toward the radio jet in VLA 1 and the expanding shell-like structure in VLA
2. .......... We have made elliptical fits to the VLA 2 H$_2$O maser shell-like structure observed
in the different epochs (1999, 2005, and 2007), and found that the shell is still expanding eight
years after its discovery. From the difference in the size of the semi-major axes of the fitted ellipses
in the epochs 1999 ($\simeq$ 71$\pm$1 mas), 2005 ($\simeq$ 97$\pm$3 mas), and 2007 ($\simeq$ 111$\pm$1
mas), we estimate an average expanding velocity of $\sim$ 5 mas yr$^{-1}$, similar to the proper
motions measured in the individual H$_2$O maser features. A kinematic age of $\sim$ 20 yr is derived
for this structure. In addition, our VERA observations indicate an increase in the ellipticity
of the expanding shell around VLA 2 from epochs 1999 to 2007. In fact, the elliptical fit of the VERA
data shows a ratio between the minor and major axes of $\sim$ 0.6, in contrast with a most circular
shape for the shell detected in 1999 and 2005 (b/a $\sim$ 0.9). This suggests that we are probably
observing the formation of a jet-driven H$_2$O maser structure in VLA2, evolving from a non-collimated
pulsed-outflow event during the first stages of evolution of a massive young stellar object (YSO).
This may support predictions made earlier by other authors on this issue, consistent with recent
magnetohydrodynamical simulations. We discuss possible implications of our results in the study
of the first stages of evolution of massive YSOs.
