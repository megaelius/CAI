Profiles of dark matter-dominated halos at the group and cluster scales play an important role in
modern cosmology. Using results from two very large cosmological N-body simulations, which increase
the available volume at their mass resolution by roughly two orders of magnitude, we robustly determine
the halo concentration-mass $(c-M)$ relation over a wide range of masses employing multiple methods
of concentration measurement. We characterize individual halo profiles as well as stacked profiles,
relevant for galaxy-galaxy lensing and next-generation cluster surveys; the redshift range covered
is $0\leq z \leq 4$, with a minimum halo mass of $M_{200c}\sim2\times10^{11}{\rm M}_\odot$. Despite
the complexity of a proper description of a halo (environmental effects, merger history, nonsphericity,
relaxation state), when the mass is scaled by the nonlinear mass scale $M_\star(z)$, we find that
a simple non-power law form for the $c-M/M_\star$ relation provides an excellent description of
our simulation results across eight decades in $M/M_{\star}$ and for $0\leq z \leq 4$. Over the mass
range covered, the $c-M$ relation has two asymptotic forms: an approximate power law below a mass
threshold $M/M_\star\sim 500-1000$, transitioning to a constant value, $c_0\sim 3$ at higher
masses. The relaxed halo fraction decreases with mass, transitioning to a constant value of $\sim
0.5$ above the same mass threshold. We compare Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and Einasto fits to stacked
profiles in narrow mass bins at different redshifts; expectedly, the Einasto profile provides
a better description of the simulation results. At cluster scales at low redshift, however, both
NFW and Einasto profiles are in very good agreement with the simulation results, consistent with
recent weak lensing observations.
