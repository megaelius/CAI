We present ALMA and ACA [CI]$^{3}P_{1}-^{3}P_{0}$ ([CI](1-0)) observations of NGC6240, which
we combine with ALMA CO(2-1) and IRAM PdBI CO(1-0) data to study the physical properties of the massive
molecular (H$_2$) outflow. We discover that the receding and approaching sides of the H$_2$ outflow,
aligned east-west, exceed 10 kpc in their total extent. High resolution ($0.24"$) [CI](1-0) line
images surprisingly reveal that the outflow emission peaks between the two AGNs, rather than on
either of the two, and that it dominates the velocity field in this nuclear region. We combine the
[CI](1-0) and CO(1-0) data to constrain the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($\alpha_{\rm CO}$)
in the outflow, which is on average $2.1\pm1.2~\rm M_{\odot} (K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2)^{-1}$. We estimate
that $60\pm20$ % of the total H$_2$ gas reservoir of NGC6240 is entrained in the outflow, for a resulting
mass-loss rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm out}=2500\pm1200~M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$ $\equiv 50\pm30$ SFR.
This energetics rules out a solely star formation-driven wind, but the puzzling morphology challenges
a classic radiative-mode AGN feedback scenario. For the quiescent gas we compute $\langle\alpha_{\rm
CO}\rangle = 3.2\pm1.8~\rm M_{\odot} (K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2)^{-1}$, which is at least twice the value
commonly employed for (U)LIRGs. We observe a tentative trend of increasing $r_{21}\equiv L^{\prime}_{\rm
CO(2-1)}/L^{\prime}_{\rm CO(1-0)}$ ratios with velocity dispersion and measure $r_{21}>1$
in the outflow, whereas $r_{21}\simeq1$ in the quiescent gas. We propose that molecular outflows
are the location of the warmer, strongly unbound phase that partially reduces the opacity of the
CO lines in (U)LIRGs, hence driving down their global $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ and increasing their $r_{21}$
values.
