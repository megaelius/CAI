Molecular line observations using a variety of tracers are often used to investigate the kinematic
structure of molecular clouds. However, measurements of cloud velocity dispersions with different
lines, even in the same region, often yield inconsistent results. The reasons for this disagreement
are not entirely clear since molecular line observations are subject to a number of biases. In this
paper, we untangle and investigate various factors that drive linewidth measurement biases by
constructing synthetic position-position-velocity cubes for a variety of tracers from a suite
of self-gravitating magnetohydrodynamic simulations of molecular clouds. We compare linewidths
derived from synthetic observations of these data cubes to the true values in the simulations. We
find that differences in linewidth as measured by different tracers are driven by a combination
of density-dependent excitation, whereby tracers that are sensitive to higher densities sample
smaller regions with smaller velocity dispersions, opacity broadening, especially for highly
optically thick tracers such as CO, and finite resolution and sensitivity, which suppress the wings
of emission lines. We find that, at fixed signal to noise ratio, three commonly-used tracers, the
J=4->3 line of CO, the J=1->0 line of C^{18}O and the (1,1) inversion transition of NH_3, generally
offer the best compromise between these competing biases, and produce estimates of the velocity
dispersion that reflect the true kinematics of a molecular cloud to an accuracy of about 10% regardless
of the cloud magnetic field strengths, evolutionary state, or orientations of the line of sight
relative to the magnetic field.
