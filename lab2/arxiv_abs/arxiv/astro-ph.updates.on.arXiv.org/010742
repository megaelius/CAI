The study of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) coronae embedded in noncool core (NCC) galaxy clusters
is crucial to understand the BCG's role in galaxy cluster evolution as well as the activation of the
self-regulated cooling and heating mechanism in the central regions of galaxy clusters. We explore
the X-ray properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) of the NCC galaxy cluster MKW 08 and the BCG
corona, along with their interface region. With recent and deep archival Chandra observations,
we study the BCG corona in detail, and with archival XMM-Newton observations, we investigate the
implications of the central active galactic nuclei (AGN) on the BCG. We carry out imaging and spectral
analyses of MKW 08 with archival XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray observations. Our spectral analysis
suggests the presence of a central AGN by a power-law with a photon index of $\Gamma$ ~ 1.8 at the core
of its BCG. Although the ICM does not exhibit a cluster scale cool core, the BCG manifests itself as
a mini cool core characterized by a cooling time as short as 64 Myr at r = 3 kpc centered at the galaxy.
The isothermality of the BCG corona seems to favor mechanical feedback from the central AGN as the
major source of gas heating. The gas pressure profile of this mini cool core suggests that the BCG
coronal gas reaches pressure equilibrium with the hotter and less dense ICM inside an interface
of nearly constant pressure, delimited by radii 4 < r < 10 kpc at the galactic center. As revealed by
the presence of a metal enriched tail (Z ~ 0.5 - 0.9 Solar) extending up to 40 kpc, the BCG corona seems
to be experiencing ram-pressure stripping by the surrounding ICM and/or interacting with a nearby
galaxy, IC 1042.}
