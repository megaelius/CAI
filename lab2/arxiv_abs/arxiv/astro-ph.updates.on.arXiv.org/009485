The latest measurements of CMB electron scattering optical depth reported by Planck significantly
reduces the allowed space of HI reionization models, pointing toward a later ending and/or less
extended phase transition than previously believed. Reionization impulsively heats the intergalactic
medium (IGM) to $\sim10^4$ K, and owing to long cooling and dynamical times in the diffuse gas, comparable
to the Hubble time, memory of reionization heating is retained. Therefore, a late ending reionization
has significant implications for the structure of the $z\sim5-6$ Lyman-$\alpha$ (ly$\alpha$)
forest. Using state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations that allow us to vary the timing of
reionization and its associated heat injection, we argue that extant thermal signatures from reionization
can be detected via the Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum at $5< z<6$. This arises because the small-scale
cutoff in the power depends not only the the IGM temperature at these epochs, but is also particularly
sensitive to the pressure smoothing scale set by the IGM full thermal history. Comparing our different
reionization models with existing measurements of the Ly$\alpha$ forest flux power spectrum at
$z=5.0-5.4$, we find that models satisfying Planck's $\tau_e$, constraint favor a moderate amount
of heat injection consistent with galaxies driving reionization, but disfavoring quasar-driven
scenarios. We explore the impact of different reionization histories and heating models on the
shape of the power spectrum, and find that they can produce similar effects, but argue that this degeneracy
can be broken with high enough quality data. We study the feasibility of measuring the flux power
spectrum at $z\simeq 6$ using mock quasar spectra and conclude that a sample of $\sim10$ high-resolution
spectra with an attainable signal-to-noise ratio will allow distinguishing between different
reionization scenarios.
