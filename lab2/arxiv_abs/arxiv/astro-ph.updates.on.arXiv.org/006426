Results from a numerical study of small-scale turbulent dynamo in a collisionless, weakly magnetized
plasma are presented. The key difference between this dynamo and its magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
counterpart is the adiabatic production of magnetic-field-aligned pressure anisotropy by the
amplification of a weak seed field. This in turn drives kinetic instabilities on the ion-Larmor
scale---namely, firehose and mirror---which sever the adiabatic link between the thermal and
magnetic pressures, thereby allowing the dynamo to proceed. After an initial phase of rapid growth
driven by these instabilities, the magnetic energy grows exponentially and exhibits a $k^{3/2}$
spectrum that peaks near the resistive scale, similar to the large-magnetic-Prandtl-number ($\mathrm{Pm}\gg{1}$)
MHD dynamo. The magnetic field self-organizes into a folded-sheet topology, with direction reversals
at the resistive scale and field lines curved at the parallel scale of the flow. The effective $\mathrm{Pm}$
is determined by whether the ion-Larmor scale is above or below the field-reversing scale: in the
former case, particles undergo Bohm-like diffusion; in the latter case, particles scatter primarily
off firehose fluctuations residing at the ends of the magnetic folds, and the viscosity becomes
anisotropic. The magnetic field ultimately saturates at dynamical strengths, but without scale-by-scale
equipartition with the kinetic energy. This feature, along with an anti-correlation of magnetic-field
strength and field-line curvature and a gradual thinning of magnetic sheets into ribbons, resemble
the saturated state of the large-$\mathrm{Pm}$ dynamo, the primary differences manifesting in
firehose/mirror-unstable regions. These results have implications for magnetic-field growth
in the weakly collisional intracluster medium of galaxy clusters.
