Despite reduced insolation in the late Archean, evidence suggests a warm climate which was likely
sustained by a stronger greenhouse effect, the so-called Faint Young Sun Problem (FYSP). CO2 and
CH4 are generally thought to be the mainstays of this enhanced greenhouse, though many other gases
have been proposed. We present high accuracy radiative forcings for CO2, CH4 and 26 other gases,
performing the radiative transfer calculations at line-by-line resolution and using HITRAN 2012
line data for background pressures of 0.5, 1, and 2 bar of atmospheric N2. For CO2 to resolve the FYSP
alone at 2.8 Gyr BP (80% of present solar luminosity), 0.32 bar is needed with 0.5 bar of atmospheric
N2, 0.20 bar with 1 bar of atmospheric N2, or 0.11 bar with 2 bar of atmospheric N2. For CH4, we find that
near-infrared absorption is much stronger than previously thought, arising from updates to the
HITRAN database. CH4 radiative forcing peaks at 10.3, 9, or 8.3 Wm-2 for background pressures of
0.5, 1 or 2 bar, likely limiting the utility of CH4 for warming the Archean. For the other 26 HITRAN
gases, radiative forcings of up to a few to 10 Wm-2 are obtained from concentrations of 0.1-1 ppmv
for many gases. For the 20 strongest gases, we calculate the reduction in radiative forcing due to
overlap. We also tabulate the modern sources, sinks, concentrations and lifetimes of these gases
and summaries the literature on Archean sources and concentrations. We recommend the forcings
provided here be used both as a first reference for which gases are likely good greenhouse gases,
and as a standard set of calculations for validation of radiative forcing calculations for the Archean.
