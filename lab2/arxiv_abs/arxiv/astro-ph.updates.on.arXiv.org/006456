Aims. 2015 BZ509 is the first asteroid confirmed to be in retrograde co-orbit resonance (or 1/-1
resonance) with the giant planets in the solar system. While Saturn is the only giant planet whose
Trojans are not discovered until now, we identify some small bodies among Centaurs and Damocloids
that are potentially in 1/-1 resonance with Saturn in the present study. Methods. We integrate numerically
the motion of the 1000 clones (include the nominal orbit) of each Centaur whose orbit has a semi-major
axis between 9.3 au and 9.8 au and an inclination i > 90 deg. To confirm and evaluate the 1/-1 resonant
configurations mentioned above, we introduce a useful one-degree integrable approximation for
planar 1/-1 resonance. Results. We identify four candidates potentially in 1/-1 resonance with
Saturn. The capture in this particular resonant state during the 40000 yr integration timespan
is very common for 2006 RJ2 (906/1000 clones), 2006 BZ8 (878/1000 clones), and 2017 SV13 (998/1000
clones), and it is less likely for 2012 YE8 (426/1000 clones). According to our statistical results,
2006 RJ2 is the best candidate to be currently in a 1/-1 mean motion resonance with Saturn, and 2017
SV13 is another important potential candidate. Moreover, 2012 YE8 and 2006 BZ8 are also Centaurs
of interest but their current and long-term 1/-1 resonant state with Saturn is less likely. The proportions
of the clones captured in the relative long-term stable co-orbit resonance (over 10000 yr) are also
given. Conclusions. Small bodies in retrograde co-orbit resonance with giant planets may be more
common than previously expected. Identification of these potential mysterious minor bodies encourages
the search for such objects on a larger scale in our solar system. The findings of this paper are also
useful for understanding the origin and dynamical evolution of the Centaurs and Damocloids on retrograde
orbits.
