We present new photometric and spectral observations of the newly discovered nova-like eclipsing
star 2MASS J01074282+4845188. To obtain a light curve solution we used model of a nova-like star
whose emission sources are a white dwarf surrounded by an accretion disk, a secondary star filling
its Roche lobe, a hot spot and a hot line. 2MASS J01074282+4845188 shows the deepest permanent eclipse
among the known nova-like stars. It is reproduced by covering the very bright accretion disk by the
secondary component. The luminosity of the disk is much bigger than that of the rest light sources.
The determined high temperature of the disk is typical for that observed during the outbursts of
CVs. The primary of 2MASS J01074282+4845188 is one of the hottest white dwarfs in CVs. The temperature
of 5090 K of its secondary is also quite high and more appropriate for a long-period SW Sex star. It
might be explained by the intense heating from the hot white dwarf and the hot accretion disk of the
target. The high mass accretion rate $\dot{M} = 8\times 10^{-9} M_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$, the broad
and single-peaked H$\alpha$ emission profile, and the presence of an S-wave are sure signs for the
SW Sex classification of 2MASS J01074282+4845188. The obtained flat temperature distribution
along the disk radius as well as the deviation of the energy distribution from the black-body law
are evidence of the non-steady emission of the disk. The close values of the disk temperature and
the parameter $\alpha_{g}$ of 2MASS J01074282+4845188 and those of the cataclysmic stars at eruptions
might be considered as an additional argument for the permanent active state of nova-like stars.
