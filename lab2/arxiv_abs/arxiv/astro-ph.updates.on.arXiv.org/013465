We present the results from the timing and spectral study of Mrk\,421 based mainly on the \emph{Swift}
data in the X-ray energy range obtained during the time interval 2015\,December--2018\,April.
The most extreme X-ray flaring activity on the long-term, daily and intraday timescales was observed
during the 2-month period which started in 2017\,December when the 0.3--10\,keV flux exceeded
a level of 5$\times$10$^{-9}$erg\,cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, recorded only twice previously. While
the TeV-band and X-ray variabilities mostly were correlated, the source often varied in a complex
manner in the MeV--GeV and radio--UV energy ranges, indicating that the multifrequency emission
of Mrk\,421 could not be always generated in a single zone. The longer-term flares at X-rays and $\gamma$-rays
showed a lognormal character, possibly indicating a variability imprint of the accretion disk
onto the jet. A vast majority of the 0.3--10\,keV spectra were consistent with the log-parabolic
model, showing relatively low spectral curvature and correlations between the different spectral
parameters, predicted in the case of the first and second-order Fermi processes. The position of
the synchrotron spectral energy distribution (SED) peak showed an extreme variability on diverse
timescales between the energies $E_{\rm p}$$<$0.1\,keV and $E_{\rm p}$$>$15\,keV, with 15\%
of the spectra peaking at hard X-rays and was related to the peak height as $S_{\rm p}$$\varpropto$$E^{\alpha}_{\rm
p}$ with $\alpha$$\sim$0.6, which is expected for the transition from Kraichnan-type turbulence
into the \textquotedblleft hard-sphere\textquotedblright~ one. The 0.3--300\,GeV spectra
showed the features of the hadronic contribution, jet-star interaction and upscatter in the Klein-Nishina
regime in different time intervals.
