We report on the lowest-frequency detection to date of three bursts from the fast radio burst FRB
180916, observed at 328 MHz with the Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT). The SRT observed the periodic
repeater FRB 180916 for five days from 2020 February 20 to 24 during a time interval of active radio
bursting, and detected the three bursts during the first hour of observations; no more bursts were
detected during the remaining ~ 30 hours. Simultaneous SRT observations at 1548 MHz did not detect
any bursts. Burst fluences are in the range 37 to 13 Jy ms. No relevant scattering is observed for these
bursts. We also present the results of the multi-wavelength campaign we performed on FRB 180916,
during the five days of the active window. Simultaneously with the SRT observations, others with
different time spans were performed with the Northern Cross at 408 MHz, with XMM-Newton, NICER,
INTEGRAL, AGILE, and with the TNG and two optical telescopes in Asiago, which are equipped with fast
photometers. XMM-Newton obtained data simultaneously with the three bursts detected by the SRT,
and determined a luminosity upper limit in the 0.3-10 keV energy range of ~$10^{45}$ erg/s for the
burst emission. AGILE obtained data simultaneously with the first burst and determined a fluence
upper limit in the MeV range for millisecond timescales of $ 10^{-8}$ erg cm$^{-2}$.Our results
show that absorption from the circumburst medium does not significantly affect the emission from
FRB 180916, thus limiting the possible presence of a superluminous supernova around the source,
and indicate that a cutoff for the bursting mechanism, if present, must be at lower frequencies.
Our multi-wavelength campaign sensitively constrains the broadband emission from FRB 180916,
and provides the best limits so far for the electromagnetic response to the radio bursting of this
remarkable source of fast radio bursts.
