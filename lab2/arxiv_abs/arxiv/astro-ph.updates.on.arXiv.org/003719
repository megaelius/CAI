It has been estimated that a significant proportion of binary neutron star merger events produce
long-lived massive remnants supported by differential rotation and subject to rotational instabilities.
To examine formation and oscillation of rapidly rotating neutron stars (NS) after merger, we present
an exploratory study of fully general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations using the public
code Einstein Toolkit. The attention is focused on qualitative aspects of long-term postmerger
evolution. As simplified test models, we use a moderately stiff Gamma=2 ideal-fluid equation of
state and unmagnetized irrotational equal-mass binaries with three masses well below the threshold
for prompt collapse. Our high resolution simulations generate postmerger "ringdown" gravitational
wave (GW) signals of 170 ms, sustained by rotating massive NS remnants without collapsing to black
holes. We observe that the high-density double-core structure inside the remnants gradually turns
into a quasi-axisymmetric toroidal shape. It oscillates in a quasi-periodic manner and shrinks
in size due to gravitational radiation. In the GW spectrograms, dominant double peaks persist throughout
the postmerger simulations and slowly drift to higher frequencies. A new low-frequency peak emerges
at about 100 ms after merger, owing to the growth of GW-driven unstable oscillation modes. The long-term
effect of grid resolution is also investigated using the same initial model. Moreover, we comment
on physical conditions that are favorable for the transient toroidal configuration to form, and
discuss implication of our findings on future GW observation targeting rapidly rotating NSs.
