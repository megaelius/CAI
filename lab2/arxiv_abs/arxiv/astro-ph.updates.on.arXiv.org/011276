Time-series spectrophotometric studies of exoplanets during transit using ground-based facilities
are a promising approach to characterize their atmospheric compositions. We aim to investigate
the transit spectrum of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-1b. We compare our results to those obtained at similar
wavelengths by previous space-based observations. We observed two transits of HAT-P-1b with the
Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) instrument on the Gemini North telescope using two instrument
modes covering the 320 - 800 nm and 520 - 950 nm wavelength ranges. We used time-series spectrophotometry
to construct transit light curves in individual wavelength bins and measure the transit depths
in each bin. We accounted for systematic effects. We addressed potential photometric variability
due to magnetic spots in the planet's host star with long-term photometric monitoring. We find that
the resulting transit spectrum is consistent with previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations.
We compare our observations to transit spectroscopy models that marginally favor a clear atmosphere.
However, the observations are also consistent with a flat spectrum, indicating high-altitude
clouds. We do not detect the Na resonance absorption line (589 nm), and our observations do not have
sufficient precision to study the resonance line of K at 770 nm. We show that even a single Gemini/GMOS
transit can provide constraining power on the properties of the atmosphere of HAT-P-1b to a level
comparable to that of HST transit studies in the optical when the observing conditions and target
and reference star combination are suitable. Our 520 - 950 nm observations reach a precision comparable
to that of HST transit spectra in a similar wavelength range of the same hot Jupiter, HAT-P-1b. However,
our GMOS transit between 320 - 800 nm suffers from strong systematic effects and yields larger uncertainties.
