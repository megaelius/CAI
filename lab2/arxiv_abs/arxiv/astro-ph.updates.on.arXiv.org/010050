The Echelle spectrograph operating at Vainu Bappu Telescope (VBT), India, is a general purpose
instrument used for many high-resolution spectroscopic observations. A concerted effort is being
made to expand the scientific capability of the instrument in emerging areas of observational astronomy.
The present study is aimed at evaluating the feasibility of the spectrograph to carry out precision
Radial Velocity (RV) measurements. In the current design, major factors limiting the RV precision
of the spectrograph arise from the movable grating and slit; optical aberrations; positional uncertainty
associated with optomechanical mounts and environmental and thermal instabilities in the spectrograph
room. RV instabilities due to temperature and pressure variations in the environment are estimated
to vary around 120 $ \textrm{ms}^{-1} $ and 400 $ \textrm{ms}^{-1} $ respectively. The positional
uncertainty of the grating in the spectrograph could induce a spectral shift $\sim1.4\,\textrm{kms}^{-1}
$ across the Echelle orders. A Zemax model is used to overcome the uncertainty in the zero-positioning
and lack of repeatability of the moving components. We propose to obtain the ThAr lamp observations
and using the Zemax model as the reference, predict the drifts in the positions of the optical components.
The perturbations of the optical components from the nominal position are corrected at the beginning
of the observational run. After a good match is obtained between the model and the observations,
we propose to use a Zemax model to improve the wavelength calibration solution. We could match the
observations and model within $\pm$~1 pixels accuracy after the model parameters were perturbed
in a real-time setup of the spectrograph. In this paper, we present the estimation of the perturbations
of optical components and the effect on the RV obtained.
