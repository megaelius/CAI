Context. Currently galactic exploration is being revolutionized by a flow of new data: Gaia provides
measurements of stellar distances and kinematics; growing numbers of spectroscopic surveys provide
values of stellar atmospheric parameters and abundances of elements; and Kepler and K2 missions
provide asteroseismic information for an increasing number of stars. Aims. In this work we aim to
determine stellar distances and ages using Gaia and spectrophotometric data in a consistent way.
We estimate precisions of age and distance determinations with Gaia end-of-mission and TGAS parallax
precisions. Methods. To this end we incorporated parallax and extinction data into the isochrone
fitting method used in the Unified tool to estimate Distances, Ages, and Masses (UniDAM). We prepared
datasets that allowed us to study the improvement of distance and age estimates with the inclusion
of TGAS and Gaia end-of-mission parallax precisions in isochrone fitting. Results. Using TGAS
parallaxes in isochrone fitting we are able to reduce distance and age estimate uncertainties for
TGAS stars for distances up to 1 kpc by more than one third, compared to results based only on spectrophotometric
data. With Gaia end-of-mission parallaxes in isochrone fitting we will be able to further decrease
our distance uncertainties by about a factor of 20 and age uncertainties by a factor of two for stars
up to 10 kpc away from the Sun. Conclusions. We demonstrate that we will be able to improve our distance
estimates for about one third of stars in spectroscopic surveys and to decrease log(age) uncertainties
by about a factor of two for over 80% of stars as compared to the uncertainties obtained without parallax
priors using Gaia end-of-mission parallaxes consistently with spectrophotometry in isochrone
fitting .
