In the high-eccentricity migration (HEM) scenario, close-in planets reach the vicinity of the
central star on high-eccentricity orbits that become circularized---with a concomitant decrease
in the semimajor axis---through a tidal interaction with the star. Giant planets that arrive with
periastron distances that are smaller than the Roche limit $a_\mathrm{R}$ lose their gaseous envelopes,
resulting in an inner edge to the surviving planets' distribution. The observational evidence
for this effect, while extensive, is nonetheless somewhat ambiguous because of the effect of tidal
orbital decay. Here we consider another key prediction of the HEM scenario---the existence of a
spatial eccentricity gradient near the location where the circularization time becomes comparable
to the planet's age for typical parameters. Previous studies already found evidence for this gradient
and demonstrated that its properties are consistent with the circularization process being dominated
by tidal dissipation in the planet (encapsulated by the tidal quality factor $Q^\prime_\mathrm{p}$).
Our work extends these treatments by constructing explicit model distributions for comparison
with the data and by carrying out backward-in-time integrations using observed system parameters.
We show that circularization generally occurs outside the distribution's inner edge (which defines
the boundary of the so-called sub-Jovian desert) and that typically $Q^\prime_\mathrm{p}\approx10^6$
in the circularization zone (to within a factor of 3). We also find tentative evidence for an eccentricity
gradient in lower-mass planets, indicating that formation through HEM may be relevant down to Neptune
scales.
