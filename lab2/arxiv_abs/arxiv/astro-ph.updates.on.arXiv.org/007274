We study the detailed phase-space structure of collisionless self-gravitating spherical systems
with initial power-law density profiles $\rho(r) \propto r^n$, $n$ ranging from 0 to $-1.5$, and
Gaussian velocity dispersions. Two sub-classes of models are considered, with initial virial
ratios $\eta=0.5$ ("warm") and $\eta=0.1$ ("cold"). To perform the analyses and control all sources
of numerical artefacts, we use three kinds of codes: a Vlasov and a shell code preserving spherical
symmetry, and the public $N$-body treecode Gadget-2. In all the simulations, the system first experiences
a quiescent mixing phase during which it displays, in phase-space, a smooth spiral structure whose
properties agree well with predictions from self-similar collapse when either inertial or gravitational
force dominates. At some point, all the simulations display some level of radial instability, particularly
in the cold case, where some macroscopic resonant modes destroy the spiral, but preserve the coarse-grained
structure of the system, particularly the projected density profile $\rho(r)$, except for the
Gadget-2 simulations with $n \le -1$. The latter are subject to radial orbit instability and thus
have a slightly less contrasted central density profile than Vlasov or shells simulations. Yet,
the early, quiescent evolution dominated by a folding spiral are quite representative of the system
at later time at the coarse-grained level. The non-random nature of this spiral probably prevents
the success of entropy maximisation in finding the quasi-stationary state. However, the good agreement
with self-similar predictions might be promising for the study of the fine-grained structure of
such systems.
