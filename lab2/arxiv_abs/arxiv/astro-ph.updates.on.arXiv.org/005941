We reinterpret the shear estimator proposed in Zhang & Komatsu (2011) within the framework of Shapelets
(Refregier 2003) and propose the Fourier Power Function Shapelets (FPFS) method to measure weak
lensing distortions from background galaxies. Four shapelet modes are calculated from the power
function of every galaxy's Fourier transform after deconvolving the Point Spread Function (PSF)
in Fourier space. From these shapelet modes, dimensionless FPFS ellipticity and responsivity
are constructed. We derive the transformation formula of the ellipticity under the influence of
shear for every single galaxy. Using the transformation formula, shear can be inferred from a large
ensemble of galaxies with the premise that intrinsic galaxies are randomly oriented. The FPFS method
is developed without any assumption on galaxy morphology, nor any approximation for the PSF correction.
We test the FPFS method with the GREAT3-HSC simulations, which are simulations to test shear calibration
with realistic galaxy morphologies as well as HSC-like PSFs and noise properties. The main results
are listed as follows. (i) For samples which only contain isolated galaxies, the amplitude of shear
multiplicative bias is below $0.5\%$ ($2.5\sigma$). (ii) For realistic samples which also contain
blended galaxies, the blended galaxies are deblended by the first generation HSC deblender before
shear measurement and the shear multiplicative bias of $-5.7\%$ ($14\sigma$) is found. The multiplicative
bias originating from blending is calibrated by the GREAT3-HSC simulations. Finally, we test the
consistency and stability of this calibration.
