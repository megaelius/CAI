Major solar flares are prone to occur in active region atmospheres associated with large, complex,
dynamically-evolving sunspots. This points to the importance of monitoring the evolution of starspots,
not only in visible but also in ultra violet (UV) and X-rays, in understanding the origin and occurrence
of stellar flares. To this end, we perform spectral irradiance analysis on different types of transiting
solar active regions by using a variety of full-disk synoptic observations. The target events are
an isolated sunspot, spotless plage, and emerging flux in prolonged quiet-Sun conditions selected
from the past decade. We find that the visible continuum and total solar irradiance become darkened
when the spot is at the central meridian, whereas it is bright near the solar limb; UV bands sensitive
to the chromosphere correlate well with the variation of total unsigned magnetic flux in the photosphere;
amplitudes of EUV and soft X-ray increase with the characteristic temperature, whose light curves
are flat-topped due to their sensitivity to the optically thin corona; the transiting spotless
plage does not show the darkening in the visible irradiance, while the emerging flux produces an
asymmetry in all light curves about the central meridian. The multi-wavelength sun-as-a-star
study described here indicates that such time lags between the coronal and photospheric light curves
have the potential to probe the extent of coronal magnetic fields above the starspots. In addition,
EUV wavelengths that are sensitive to the transition-region temperature sometimes show anti-phased
variations, which may be used for diagnosing plasmas around starspots.
