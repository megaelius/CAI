Rotation measure synthesis allows the estimation of Faraday dispersion via a Fourier transform
and is the primary tool to probe cosmic magnetic fields. We show this can be considered mathematically
equivalent to the one dimensional interferometric intensity measurement equation, albeit in
a different Fourier space. As a result, familiar concepts in two dimensional intensity interferometry
designed to correctly account for a range of instrumental conditions can be translated to the analysis
of Faraday dispersion. In particular, we show how to model the effect of channel averaging during
Faraday reconstruction, which has to date limited the progress of polarimetic science using wide-band
measurements. Further, we simulate 1d sparse reconstruction with channel averaging for realistic
frequency coverages, and show that it is possible to recover signals with large rotation measure
values that were previously excluded from possible detection. This is especially important for
low-frequency and wide-band polarimetry. We extended these ideas to introduce mosaicking in Faraday
depth into the channel averaging process. This work, thus provides the first framework for correctly
undertaking wide-band rotation measure synthesis, including the provision to add data from multiple
telescopes, a prospect that should vastly improve the quality and quantity of polarimetric science.
This is of particular importance for extreme environments which generate high magnetic fields
such as those associated with pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), and will allow such sources to
be accurately used as probes of cosmological fields.
