In the Sun, the properties of acoustic modes are sensitive to changes in the magnetic activity. In
particular, mode frequencies are observed to increase with increasing activity level. Thanks
to CoRoT and Kepler, such variations have been found in other solar-type stars and encode information
on the activity-related changes in their interiors. Thus, the unprecedented long-term Kepler
photometric observations provide a unique opportunity to study stellar activity through asteroseismology.
The goal of this work is to investigate the dependencies of the observed mode frequency variations
on the stellar parameters and whether those are consistent with an activity-related origin. We
select the solar-type oscillators with highest signal-to-noise ratio, in total 75 targets. Using
the temporal frequency variations determined in Santos et al. (2018), we study the relation between
those variations and the fundamental stellar properties. We also compare the observed frequency
shifts with chromospheric and photometric activity indexes, which are only available for a subset
of the sample. We find that frequency shifts increase with increasing chromospheric activity,
which is consistent with an activity-related origin of the observed frequency shifts. Frequency
shifts are also found to increase with effective temperature, which is in agreement with the theoretical
predictions for the activity-related frequency shifts by Metcalfe et al. (2007). Frequency shifts
are largest for fast rotating and young stars, which is consistent with those being more active than
slower rotators and older stars. Finally, we find evidence for frequency shifts increasing with
stellar metallicity.
