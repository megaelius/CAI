We report a $5.3\sigma$ detection of the gravitational lensing effect of cosmic voids from the Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic (BOSS) Data Release 12 seen in the $Planck$ 2018 cosmic microwave background
(CMB) lensing convergence map. To make this detection, we introduce new optimal techniques for
void stacking and filtering of the CMB maps, such as binning voids by a combination of their observed
galaxy density and size to separate those with distinctive lensing signatures. We calibrate theoretical
expectations for the void-lensing signal using mock catalogs generated in a suite of 108 full-sky
lensing simulations from Takahashi et al. (2017). Relative to these templates, we measure the lensing
amplitude parameter in the data to be $A_L=1.10 \pm 0.21$ using a matched-filter stacking technique,
and confirm it using an alternative Wiener filtering method. We demonstrate that the result is robust
against thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich contamination and other sources of systematics. We use the
lensing measurements to test the relationship between the matter and galaxy distributions within
voids, and show that the assumption of linear bias with a value consistent with galaxy clustering
results is discrepant with observation at $\sim 3\sigma$; we explain why such a result is consistent
with simulations and previous results, and is expected as a consequence of void selection effects.
We forecast the potential for void-CMB lensing measurements in future data from the Advanced ACT,
Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 experiments, showing that, for the same number of voids, the achievable
precision improves by a factor of more than two compared to $Planck$.
