Pulsar timing arrays provide a unique means to detect nanohertz gravitational waves through long-term
measurements of pulse arrival times from an ensemble of millisecond pulsars. After years of observations,
some timing array pulsars have been shown to be dominated by low-frequency red noise, including
spin noise that might be associated with pulsar rotational irregularities. The power spectral
density of pulsar timing red noise is usually modeled with a power law or a power law with a turnover
frequency below which the noise power spectrum plateaus. If there is a turnover in the spin noise
of millisecond pulsars, residing within the observation band of current and/or future pulsar timing
measurements, it may be easier than projected to resolve the gravitational-wave background from
supermassive binary black holes. Additionally, the spectral turnover can provide valuable insights
on neutron star physics. In the recent study by Melatos and Link, the authors provided a derivation
of the model for power spectral density of spin noise from superfluid turbulence in the core of a neutron
star, from first principles. The model features a spectral turnover, which depends on the dynamical
response time of the superfluid and the steady-state angular velocity lag between the crust and
the core of the star. In this work, we search for a spectral turnover in spin noise using the first data
release of the International Pulsar Timing Array. Through Bayesian model selection, we find no
evidence of a spectral turnover. Our analysis also shows that data from pulsars J1939+2134, J1024$-$0719
and J1713+0747 prefers the power-law model to the superfluid turbulence model.
