Analyses of large spectroscopic surveys of early-type stars in the LMC have found an excess of nitrogen
enriched B-type targets with a vsini<40 km/s compared with the predictions of single star evolutionary
models incorporating rotational mixing. By contrast the number of such targets with 40<vsini<80
km/s were consistent with such models. We have undertaken a similar analysis for 61 B-type similar
targets, towards the young cluster, NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Approximately
65% could have nitrogen enhancements of less than 0.3 dex, consistent with them having experienced
only small amounts of mixing due to their low rotational velocities. However as with the previous
LMC surveys, an excess of stars with low projected rotational velocities, vsini<40 km/s and significant
nitrogen enrichments is found. This is estimated to be approximately 5% of the total population
of apparently single B-type stars or 40% of all stars with current rotational velocities of less
than 40 km/s. For all three surveys, the presence of undetected binaries and other uncertainties
imply that these percentages might be underestimated and indeed it is possible that all single stars
with current rotational velocities of less than 40 km/s are nitrogen enriched. Possible explanations
incorporate the effects of magnetic fields, via either a stellar merger followed by magnetic breaking
or the evolution of a single star with a large magnetic field. Both mechanisms are compatible with
the observed frequency of nitrogen-enriched stars in the Magellanic Clouds. Differences in the
properties of the nitrogen-enriched stars compared with the remainder of the sample would be consistent
with the former mechanism. For the latter, a qualitative comparison with evolutionary models incorporating
magnetic fields is encouraging in terms of the amount of nitrogen enrichment and its presence in
stars near the ZAMS.
