The Stokes formalism of polarization physics has astounding structural parallels with the formalism
used for relativity theory in Minkowski spacetime. The structure and symmetry properties of the
Mueller matrices are the same as those for the matrix representations of the electromagnetic tensor
and the Lorentz transformation operator. The absorption terms $\eta_k$ in the Mueller matrix correspond
to the electric field components $E_k$ in the electromagnetic tensor and the Lorentz boost terms
$\gamma_k$ in the Lorentz transformation matrix, while the anomalous dispersion terms $\rho_k$
correspond to the magnetic field components $B_k$ and the spatial rotation angles $\phi_k$. In
a Minkowski-type space spanned by the Stokes $I,Q,U,V$ parameters, the Stokes vector for 100 % polarized
light is a null vector living on the surface of null cones, like the energy-momentum vector of massless
particles in ordinary Minkowski space. Stokes vectors for partially polarized light live inside
the null cones like the momentum vectors for massive particles. In this description the depolarization
of Stokes vectors appears as a "mass'' term, which has its origin in a symmetry breaking caused by
the incoherent superposition of uncorrelated fields or wave packets, without the need to refer
to a ubiquitous Higgs field as is done in particle physics. The rotational symmetry of Stokes vectors
and Mueller matrices is that of spin-2 objects, in contrast to the spin-1 nature of the electromagnetic
field. The reason for this difference is that the Stokes objects have substructure: they are formed
from bilinear tensor products between spin-1 objects, the Jones vectors and Jones matrices. The
governing physics takes place at the substructure level.
