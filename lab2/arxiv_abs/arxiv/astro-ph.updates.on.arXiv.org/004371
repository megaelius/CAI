The Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Explorer is a uniquely capable mission, with three on-board instruments
and rapid slewing capabilities. It serves as a fast-response satellite observatory for everything
from gravitational-wave counterpart searches to cometary science. Swift averages 125 different
observations per day, and is consistently over-subscribed, responding to about one-hundred Target
of Oportunity (ToO) requests per month from the general astrophysics community, as well as co-pointing
and follow-up agreements with many other observatories. Since launch in 2004, the demands put on
the spacecraft have grown consistently in terms of number and type of targets as well as schedule
complexity. To facilitate this growth, various scheduling tools and helper technologies have
been built by the Swift team to continue improving the scientific yield of the Swift mission. However,
these tools have been used only to assist humans in exploring the local pareto surface and for fixing
constraint violations. Because of the computational complexity of the scheduling task, no automation
tool has been able to produce a plan of equal or higher quality than that produced by a well-trained
human, given the necessary time constraints. In this proceeding we formalize the Swift Scheduling
Problem as a dynamic fuzzy Constraint Satisfaction Problem (DF-CSP) and explore the global solution
space. We detail here several approaches towards achieving the goal of surpassing human quality
schedules using classical optimization and algorithmic techniques, as well as machine learning
and recurrent neural network (RNN) methods. We then briefly discuss the increased scientific yield
and benefit to the wider astrophysics community that would result from the further development
and adoption of these technologies.
