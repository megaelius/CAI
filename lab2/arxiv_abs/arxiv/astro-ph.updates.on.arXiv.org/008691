As part of our on-going survey we have carried out high-contrast imaging with VLT/SPHERE/IRDIS
to obtain polarized and total intensity images of the young ($11^{+16}_{-7}$Myr old) K3IV star
Wray 15-788 within the Lower Centaurus Crux subgroup of Sco-Cen. For the total intensity images,
we remove the stellar halo by an approach based on reference star differential imaging in combination
with principal component analysis. Both total intensity and polarimetric data resolve a disk around
Wray 15-788. Modeling of the stellar spectral energy distribution suggests that this is protoplanetary
disk at a transition stage. We detect a bright, outer ring at a projected separation of $\sim$370mas
($\approx$56au), hints for inner substructures at $\sim$170mas ($\approx$28au) and a gap in between.
Only within a position angle range of $60^\circ<\varphi<240^\circ$, we are confident at 5$\sigma$
level to detect actual scattered light flux from the outer ring of the disk; the remaining part is
indistinguishable from background noise. For the detected part of the outer ring we determine a
disk inclination of $i$=21$^\circ\pm$6$^\circ$ and a position angle of $\varphi$=76$^\circ\pm$16$^\circ$.
Furthermore, we find that Wray 15-788 is part of a binary system with the A2V star HD 98363 at a separation
of $\sim$50'' ($\approx$6900au). The detection of only half of the outer ring might be due to shadowing
by a misaligned inner disk. A potential substellar companion can cause the misalignment of the inner
structures and can be responsible for clearing the detected gap from scattering material. We can
not, however, rule out the possibility of a non-detection due to our limited signal to noise ratio,
combined with brightness azimuthal asymmetry. From our data, we can exclude companions more massive
than 10$M_\mathrm{jup}$ within the gap at a separation of $\sim$230mas ($\approx$35au).
