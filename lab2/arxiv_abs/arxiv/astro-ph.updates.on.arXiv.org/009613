The distribution of three dimensional intrinsic galaxy shapes has been a longstanding open question.
The difficulty stems from projection effects meaning one must rely on statistical methods applied
to galaxy samples to infer intrinsic shape distributions. Theoretical work using analytical galaxy
potentials suggests a relationship between galaxy intrinsic shape (as defined by its "triaxiality",
in practice a proxy for how prolate a galaxy is) and the intrinsic misalignment angle between kinematic
and morphological axes ($\Psi_{\rm int}$). This relationship reduces the number of unknowns,
providing more reliable inferred intrinsic shape distributions than methods using photometry
alone. Here we explore the connection between intrinsic shape and stellar kinematics using cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations from the Illustris project. The strongest relationship we find is
that galaxy intrinsic flattening is correlated with specific angular momentum (j) with high j galaxies
being flatter than galaxies with low specific angular momentum. Our analysis shows that, although
the majority of kinematically misaligned galaxies exhibit prolate shapes, examples of kinematically
aligned prolate galaxies are also present. Clearly a direct correspondence between prolate shape
and minor-axis rotation (often referred to as "prolate rotation") is not present in Illustris.
Thus, we demonstrate that the assumption of a simple relationship between $\Psi_{\rm int}$ and
intrinsic shape commonly employed in shape recovery studies is not valid for Illustris galaxies.
We suggest improvements on the method as well as some alternative methods for future work in this
area.
