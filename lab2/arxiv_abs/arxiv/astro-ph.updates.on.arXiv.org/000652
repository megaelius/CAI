We present a clustering analysis of X-ray selected AGN by compiling X-ray samples from the literature
and re-estimating the dark matter (DM) halo masses of AGN in a uniform manner. We find that moderate
luminosity AGN (Lx(2-10 keV)=10^42-10^44 erg/sec) in the z=0-1.3 Universe are typically found
in DM haloes with masses of ~10^13 Msun. We then compare our findings to the theoretical predictions
of the coupled galaxy and black hole formation model GALFORM. We find good agreement when our calculation
includes the hot-halo mode of accretion onto the central black hole. This type of accretion, which
is additional to the common cold accretion during disk instabilities and galaxy mergers, is tightly
coupled to the AGN feedback in the model. The hot-halo mode becomes prominent in DM haloes with masses
greater than ~10^12.5 Msun, where AGN feedback typically operates, giving rise to a distinct class
of moderate luminosity AGN that inhabit rich clusters and superclusters. Cold gas fuelling of the
black hole cannot produce the observationally inferred DM halo masses of X-ray AGN. Switching off
AGN feedback in the model results in a large population of luminous quasars (Lx(2-10 keV) > 10^44
erg/sec) in DM haloes with masses up to ~10^14 Msun, which is inconsistent with the observed clustering
of quasars. The abundance of hot-halo AGN decreases significantly in the z~3-4 universe. At such
high redshifts, the cold accretion mode is solely responsible for shaping the environment of moderate
luminosity AGN. Our analysis supports two accretion modes (cold and hot) for the fuelling of supermassive
black holes and strongly underlines the importance of AGN feedback in cosmological models both
of galaxy formation and black hole growth.
