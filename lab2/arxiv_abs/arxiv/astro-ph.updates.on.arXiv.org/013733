Accurate spectroscopic lithium abundances are essential in addressing a variety of open questions,
such as the origin of a uniform lithium content in the atmospheres of metal-poor stars (Spite plateau)
or the existence of a correlation between the properties of extra-solar planetary systems and the
lithium abundance of their host stars. We have developed a tool that allows the user to improve the
accuracy of standard lithium abundance determinations based on 1D model atmospheres and the assumption
of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) by applying corrections that account for hydrodynamic
(3D) and non-LTE (NLTE) effects in FGK stars of different metallicity. Based on a grid of CO5BOLD
3D models and associated 1D hydrostatic atmospheres, we computed three libraries of synthetic
spectra of the lithium line at 670.8 nm for a wide range of lithium abundances, accounting for detailed
line formation in 3D NLTE, 1D NLTE, and 1D LTE, respectively. The resulting curves-of-growth were
then used to derive 3D NLTE and 1D NLTE lithium abundance corrections. We demonstrate that 3D and
NLTE effects are small for metal-poor stars on the Spite plateau, leading to errors of at most +/-0.05
dex if ignored. The largest corrections are found at the coolest effective temperature, Teff=5000
K, where they can reach -0.4 dex for the strongest lines. We present analytical functions for evaluating
the corrections and for directly converting a given lithium abundance into an equivalent width,
or vice versa, a given equivalent width (EW) into a lithium abundance. For convenience, a Python
script is made available that evaluates all fitting functions for given Teff, log g, [Fe/H], and
A(Li) or EW. By means of the fitting functions, the results of complex 3D and NLTE calculations are
made readily accessible and quickly applicable to large samples of stars across a wide range of metallicities.
