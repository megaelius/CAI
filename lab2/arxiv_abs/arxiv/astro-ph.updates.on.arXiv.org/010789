High-mass microquasars (HMMQs) are systems from which relativistic jets are launched. At the scales
of several times the binary system size, the jets are expected to follow a helical path caused by the
interaction with a strong stellar wind and orbital motion. Such a trajectory has its influence on
the non-thermal emission of the jets, which also depends strongly on the observing angle due to Doppler
boosting effects. We explore how the expected non-thermal emission of HMMQ jets at small scales
is affected by the impact of the stellar wind and the orbital motion on the jet propagation. We studied
the broadband non-thermal emission, from radio to gamma rays, produced in HMMQ jets up to a distance
of several orbital separations, taking into account a realistic jet trajectory, different model
parameters, and orbital modulation. The jet trajectory is computed by considering momentum transfer
with the stellar wind. Electrons are injected at the position where a recollimation shock in the
jets is expected due to the wind impact. Their distribution along the jet path is obtained assuming
local acceleration at the recollimation shock, and cooling via adiabatic, synchrotron, and inverse
Compton processes. The synchrotron and inverse Compton emission is calculated taking into account
synchrotron self-absorption within the jet, free-free absorption with the stellar wind, and absorption
by stellar photons via pair production. Asymmetric light curves are obtained owing to the helical
trajectory of the jets. The presence of helical shaped jets could be inferred from asymmetries in
the light curves, which become noticeable only for large jet Lorentz factors and low magnetic fields.
Model parameters could be constrained if accurate phase-resolved light curves from GeV to TeV energies
were available.
