As an important candidate gravity theory alternative to dark energy, a class of $f(R)$ modified
gravity, which introduces a perturbation of the Ricci scalar $R$ in the Einstein-Hilbert action,
has been extensively applied to cosmology to explain the acceleration of the universe. In this paper,
we focus on the recently-released VLBI observations of the compact structure in intermediate-luminosity
quasars combined with the angular-diameter-distance measurements from galaxy clusters, which
consists of 145 data points performing as individual cosmological standard rulers in the redshift
range $0.023\le z\le 2.80$, to investigate observational constraints on two viable models in $f(R)$
theories within the Palatini formalism: $f_1(R)=R-\frac{a}{R^b}$ and $f_2(R)=R-\frac{aR}{R+ab}$.
We also combine the individual standard ruler data with the observations of CMB and BAO, which provides
stringent constraints. Furthermore, two model diagnostics, $Om(z)$ and statefinder, are also
applied to distinguish the two $f(R)$ models and $\Lambda$CDM model. Our results show that (1) The
quasars sample performs very well to place constraints on the two $f(R)$ cosmologies, which indicates
its potential to act as a powerful complementary probe to other cosmological standard rulers. (2)
The $\Lambda$CDM model, which corresponds to $b=0$ in the two $f(R)$ cosmologies is still included
within $1\sigma$ range. However, there still exists some possibility that $\Lambda$CDM may not
the best cosmological model preferred by the current high-redshift observations. (3) The information
criteria indicate that the cosmological constant model is still the best one, while the $f_1(R)$
model gets the smallest observational support. (4) The $f_2(R)$ model, which evolves quite different
from $f_1(R)$ model at early times, still significantly deviates from both $f_1(R)$ and $\Lambda$CDM
model at the present time.
