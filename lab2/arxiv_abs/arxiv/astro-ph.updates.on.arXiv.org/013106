Predictions of solar cycle 24 obtained from the advection-dominated and diffusion-dominated
kinematic dynamo model are different if we consider only the Babcock-Leighton mechanism as a poloidal
field generation source term. Yeates et al (2008) argue that the discrepancy between the results
is due to the different memory of solar dynamo for advection- and diffusion-dominated solar convection
zones. We aim to investigate the discrepancy between the solar cycle memory obtained from advection-dominated
and diffusion-dominated kinematic solar dynamo models. Specifically, we want to investigate
whether another poloidal field generation mechanism, namely, Parker's mean-field alpha effect
has any impact on the memory of the solar cycle. We used a kinematic flux transport solar dynamo model
where poloidal field generation takes place due to both the Babcock-Leighton mechanism and mean-field
alpha effect. The addition of a mean-field alpha effect reduces the memory of the Babcock Leighton
solar dynamo to within one cycle for both advection-and diffusion-dominated dynamo regimes. Our
result provides an alternative resolution to the discrepancy in memory of advection- and diffusion-dominated
kinematic dynamo models. We also find a moderate decrease in the correlation between the radial
flux at the cycle minima and the toroidal flux at the maxima of the next cycle with the increase of mean-field
alpha amplitude. We confirm the conclusions of Yeates et al (2008) and Karak and Nandy (2012) regarding
the short, one-cycle memory of the solar cycle. We establish that the mean-field alpha effect impacts
the memory of the solar cycle. However, correlation coefficients are highly dependent on the assumed
amplitude and fluctuation levels of the mean-field alpha
