The Simons Observatory (SO) is a new cosmic microwave background experiment being built on Cerro
Toco in Chile, due to begin observations in the early 2020s. We describe the scientific goals of the
experiment, motivate the design, and forecast its performance. SO will measure the temperature
and polarization anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background in six frequency bands: 27, 39,
93, 145, 225 and 280 GHz. The initial configuration of SO will have three small-aperture 0.5-m telescopes
(SATs) and one large-aperture 6-m telescope (LAT), with a total of 60,000 cryogenic bolometers.
Our key science goals are to characterize the primordial perturbations, measure the number of relativistic
species and the mass of neutrinos, test for deviations from a cosmological constant, improve our
understanding of galaxy evolution, and constrain the duration of reionization. The SATs will target
the largest angular scales observable from Chile, mapping ~10% of the sky to a white noise level of
2 $\mu$K-arcmin in combined 93 and 145 GHz bands, to measure the primordial tensor-to-scalar ratio,
$r$, at a target level of $\sigma(r)=0.003$. The LAT will map ~40% of the sky at arcminute angular
resolution to an expected white noise level of 6 $\mu$K-arcmin in combined 93 and 145 GHz bands, overlapping
with the majority of the LSST sky region and partially with DESI. With up to an order of magnitude lower
polarization noise than maps from the Planck satellite, the high-resolution sky maps will constrain
cosmological parameters derived from the damping tail, gravitational lensing of the microwave
background, the primordial bispectrum, and the thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects,
and will aid in delensing the large-angle polarization signal to measure the tensor-to-scalar
ratio. The survey will also provide a legacy catalog of 16,000 galaxy clusters and more than 20,000
extragalactic sources.
