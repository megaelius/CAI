Studies of the atmospheres of hot Jupiters reveal a diversity of atmospheric composition and haze
properties. Similar studies on individual smaller, temperate planets are rare due to the inherent
difficulty of the observations and also to the average faintness of their host stars. To investigate
their ensemble atmospheric properties, we construct a sample of 28 similar planets, all possess
equilibrium temperature within 300-500K, have similar size (1-3 R_e), and orbit early M dwarfs
and late K dwarfs with effective temperatures within a few hundred Kelvin of one another. In addition,
NASA's Kepler/K2 and Spitzer missions gathered transit observations of each planet, producing
an uniform transit data set both in wavelength and coarse planetary type. With the transits measured
in Kepler's broad optical bandpass and Spitzer's 4.5 micron wavelength bandpass, we measure the
transmission spectral slope, alpha, for the entire sample. While this measurement is too uncertain
in nearly all cases to infer the properties of any individual planet, the distribution of alpha among
several dozen similar planets encodes a key trend. We find that the distribution of alpha is not well-described
by a single Gaussian distribution. Rather, a ratio of the Bayesian evidences between the likeliest
1-component and 2-component Gaussian models favors the latter by a ratio of 100:1. One Gaussian
is centered around an average alpha=-1.3, indicating hazy/cloudy atmospheres or bare cores with
atmosphere evaporated. A smaller but significant second population (20+\-10% of all) is necessary
to model significantly higher alpha values, which indicate atmospheres with potentially detectable
molecular features. We conclude that the atmospheres of small and temperate planets are far from
uniformly flat, and that a subset are particularly favorable for follow-up observation from space-based
platforms like HST and JWST.
