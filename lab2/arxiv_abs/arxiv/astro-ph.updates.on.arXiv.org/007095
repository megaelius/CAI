Recent analyses suggest that distance residuals measured from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are correlated
with local host galaxy properties within a few kpc of the SN explosion. However, the well-established
correlation with global host galaxy properties is nearly as significant, with a shift of 0.06 mag
across a low to high mass boundary (the mass step). Here, with 273 SNe Ia at $z<0.1$, we investigate
whether stellar masses and rest-frame $u-g$ colors of regions within 1.5 kpc of the SN Ia explosion
site are significantly better correlated with SN distance measurements than global properties
or properties measured at random locations in SN hosts. At $\lesssim2\sigma$ significance, local
properties tend to correlate with distance residuals better than properties at random locations,
though despite using the largest low-$z$ sample to date we cannot definitively prove that a local
correlation is more significant than a random correlation. Our data hint that SNe observed by surveys
that do not target a pre-selected set of galaxies may have a larger local mass step than SNe from surveys
that do, an increase of $0.071\pm0.036$ mag (2.0$\sigma$). We find a $3\sigma$ local mass step after
global mass correction, evidence that SNe Ia should be corrected for their local mass, but we note
that this effect is insignificant in the targeted low-$z$ sample. Only the local mass step remains
significant at $>2\sigma$ after global mass correction, and we conservatively estimate a systematic
shift in H$_0$ measurements of -0.14 $\textrm{km}\,\textrm{s}^{-1}\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ with
an additional uncertainty of 0.14 $\textrm{km}\,\textrm{s}^{-1}\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, $\sim$10\%
of the present uncertainty.
