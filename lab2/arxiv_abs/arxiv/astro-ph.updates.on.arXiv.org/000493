We study the effects of radiative transfer on the Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs) of
simulations of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the widely studied $^{13}$CO 2-1 transition.
We find that the integrated intensity maps generally follow a log-normal distribution, with the
cases that have $\tau \approx 1$ best matching the PDF of the column density. We fit a 2D variance-sonic
Mach number relationship to our logarithmic PDFs of the form $\sigma_{ln(\Sigma/\Sigma_0)}^2=A\times
ln(1+b^2{\cal M}_s^2)$ and find that, for parameter $b=1/3$, parameter $A$ depends on the radiative
transfer environment. We also explore the variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the linear PDFs finding
that higher moments reflect both higher sonic Mach number and lower optical depth. Finally, we apply
the Tsallis incremental PDF function and find that the fit parameters depend on both Mach numbers,
but also are sensitive to the radiative transfer parameter space, with the $\tau \approx 1$ case
best fitting the incremental PDF of the true column density. We conclude that, for PDFs of low optical
depth cases, part of the gas is always sub-thermally excited so that the spread of the line intensities
exceeds the spread of the underlying column densities and hence the PDFs do not reflect the true column
density. Similarly, PDFs of optically thick cases are dominated by the velocity dispersion and
therefore do not represent the true column density PDF. Thus, in the case of molecules like carbon
monoxide, the dynamic range of intensities, structures observed and consequently, the observable
PDFs, are less determined by turbulence and more-often determined by radiative transfer effects.
