Previous works focused on exoplanets discovered with the radial velocity (RV) method reported
an anti-correlation between the orbital eccentricities of the exoplanets and the multiplicity
M (i.e., number of planets) of their system. We further investigate this reported anti-correlation
here using a dataset comprising exoplanets discovered with both the RV and transit methods, searching
for hints of its causes by exploring the connection between the number of planets and the dynamical
state of the exosystems. To examine the correlation between multiplicity and orbital eccentricity,
for every multiplicity case considered (1<M<7), we computed the weighted average eccentricities
instead of the median eccentricities used previously. The average eccentricities were calculated
using the inverse of the uncertainty on the eccentricity values as weights. The analysis of the dynamic
state of the exosystems was performed by computing their angular momentum deficit (AMD), a diagnostic
parameter used in the study of solar system and recently applied to exosystems. Our results confirm
the reported multiplicity-eccentricity anti-correlation and show that the use of the uncertainties
on the orbital eccentricities in the analysis allows for a better agreement between data and fits.
Our best fit reproduces well the behaviour of average eccentricities for all systems with M>1, including
the additional cases of TRAPPIST-1 (M=7) and solar system (M=8). The AMD analysis, while not conclusive
due to the limited number of exosystems that could be analysed, also suggests the existence of an
anti-correlation between the multiplicity and the AMD of exosystems. This second anticorrelation,
if confirmed by future studies, raises the possibility that the population of low-multiplicity
exosystems is contaminated by former high-multiplicity systems that became dynamically unstable
and lost some of their planets.
