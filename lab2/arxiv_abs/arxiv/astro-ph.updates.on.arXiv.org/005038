Aims. We aim to investigate if the environment (characterised by the host dark matter halo mass)
plays any role in shaping the galaxy star formation main sequence (MS). Methods. The Galaxy and Mass
Assembly project (GAMA) combines a spectroscopic survey with photometric information in 21 bands
from the far-ultraviolet (FUV) to the far-infrared (FIR). Stellar masses and dust-corrected star-formation
rates (SFR) are derived from spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling using MAGPHYS. We use
the GAMA galaxy group catalogue to examine the variation of the fraction of star-forming galaxies
(SFG) and properties of the MS with respect to the environment. Results. We examine the environmental
dependence for stellar mass selected samples without preselecting star-forming galaxies and
study any dependence on the host halo mass separately for centrals and satellites out to z ~ 0.3. We
find the SFR distribution at fixed stellar mass can be described by the combination of two Gaussians
(referred to as the star-forming Gaussian and the quiescent Gaussian). Using the observed bimodality
to define SFG, we investigate how the fraction of SFG F(SFG) and properties of the MS change with environment.
For centrals, the position of the MS is similar to the field but with a larger scatter. No significant
dependence on halo mass is observed. For satellites, the position of the MS is almost always lower
(by ~0.2 dex) compared to the field and the width is almost always larger. F(SFG) is similar between
centrals (in different halo mass bins) and field galaxies. However, for satellites F(SFG) decreases
with increasing halo mass and this dependence is stronger towards lower redshift.
