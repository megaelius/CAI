We present integral field unit spectroscopic observations of southern Galactic planetary nebulae
(PNe), IC 2501, Hen 2-7, and PB4. The goal of studying these objects together is that, although they
have roughly similar intermediate excitation and evolution of central stars (CSs), they display
very different evolution in their nebular structure which needs to be understood. The morphologies
and ionisation structures of the objects are investigated using a set of emission-line maps representative
of the different ionisation zones. We use those in order to construct two-zone self-consistent
photoionisation models for each nebula to determine new model-dependent distances, progenitor
luminosities, effective temperatures and CS masses. The physical conditions, chemical compositions,
and expansion velocities and ages of these nebulae are derived. In Hen 2-7 we discover a strong poleward-directed
jet from the presumed binary CS. Oxygen and nitrogen abundances derived from both collisionally
excited and recombination lines reveal that PB4 displays an extreme abundance discrepancy factor,
and we present evidence that this is caused by uorescent pumping of the OII ion by the EUV continuum
of an interacting binary CS, rather than by recombination of the OIII ion. Both IC 2501 and PB4 were
classified by others as Weak Emission Line Stars (WELS). However, our emission line maps show that
their recombination lines are spatially extended in both objects, and are therefore of nebular
rather than CS origin. Given that we have found this result in a number of other PNe, this result casts
further doubt on the reliability, or even the reality, of the WELS classification.
