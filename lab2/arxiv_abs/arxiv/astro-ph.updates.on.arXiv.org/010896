We present the implementation and the first results of cosmic ray (CR) feedback in the Feedback In
Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations. We investigate CR feedback in non-cosmological simulations
of dwarf, sub-$L\star$ starburst, and $L\star$ galaxies with different propagation models, including
advection, isotropic and anisotropic diffusion, and streaming along field lines with different
transport coefficients. We simulate CR diffusion and streaming simultaneously in galaxies with
high resolution, using a two moment method. We forward-model and compare to observations of $\gamma$-ray
emission from nearby and starburst galaxies. We reproduce the $\gamma$-ray observations of dwarf
and $L\star$ galaxies with constant isotropic diffusion coefficient $\kappa \sim 3\times 10^{29}\,{\rm
cm^{2}\,s^{-1}}$. Advection-only and streaming-only models produce order-of-magnitude too
large $\gamma$-ray luminosities in dwarf and $L\star$ galaxies. We show that in models that match
the $\gamma$-ray observations, most CRs escape low-gas-density galaxies (e.g.\ dwarfs) before
significant collisional losses, while starburst galaxies are CR proton calorimeters. While adiabatic
losses can be significant, they occur only after CRs escape galaxies, so they are only of secondary
importance for $\gamma$-ray emissivities. Models where CRs are ``trapped'' in the star-forming
disk have lower star formation efficiency, but these models are ruled out by $\gamma$-ray observations.
For models with constant $\kappa$ that match the $\gamma$-ray observations, CRs form extended
halos with scale heights of several kpc to several tens of kpc.
