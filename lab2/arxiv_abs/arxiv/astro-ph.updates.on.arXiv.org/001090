The NGVS-IR project (Next Generation Virgo Survey - Infrared) is a contiguous near-infrared imaging
survey of the Virgo cluster of galaxies. It complements the optical wide-field survey of Virgo (NGVS).
The current state of NGVS-IR consists of Ks-band imaging of 4 deg^2 centered on M87, and J and Ks-band
imaging of 16 deg^2 covering the region between M49 and M87. In this paper, we present the observations
of the central 4 deg^2 centered on Virgo's core region. The data were acquired with WIRCam on the Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope and the total integration time was 41 hours distributed in 34 contiguous tiles. A survey-specific
strategy was designed to account for extended galaxies while still measuring accurate sky brightness
within the survey area. The average 5\sigma limiting magnitude is Ks=24.4 AB mag and the 50% completeness
limit is Ks=23.75 AB mag for point source detections, when using only images with better than 0.7"
seeing (median seeing 0.54"). Star clusters are marginally resolved in these image stacks, and
Virgo galaxies with \mu_Ks=24.4 AB mag arcsec^-2 are detected. Combining the Ks data with optical
and ultraviolet data, we build the uiK color-color diagram which allows a very clean color-based
selection of globular clusters in Virgo. This diagnostic plot will provide reliable globular cluster
candidates for spectroscopic follow-up campaigns needed to continue the exploration of Virgo's
photometric and kinematic sub-structures, and will help the design of future searches for globular
clusters in extragalactic systems. Equipped with this powerful new tool, future NGVS-IR investigations
based on the uiK diagram will address the mapping and analysis of extended structures and compact
stellar systems in and around Virgo galaxies.
