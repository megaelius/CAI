I analyse and numerically evaluate the radiation field generated by an experimentally realized
embodiment of an electric polarization current whose rotating distribution pattern moves with
linear speeds exceeding the speed of light in vacuum. I find that the flux density of the resulting
emission (i) has a dominant value and is linearly polarized within a sharply delineated radiation
beam whose orientation and polar width are determined by the range of values of the linear speeds
of the rotating source distribution, and (ii) decays with the distance $d$ from the source as $d^{-\alpha}$
in which the value of $\alpha$ lies between $1$ and $2$ (instead of being equal to $2$ as in a conventional
radiation) across the beam. In that the rate at which boundaries of the retarded distribution of
such a source change with time depends on its duration monotonically, this is an intrinsically transient
emission process: temporal rate of change of the energy density of the radiation generated by it
has a time-averaged value that is negative (instead of being zero as in a conventional radiation)
at points where the envelopes of the wave fronts emanating from the constituent volume elements
of the source distribution are cusped. The difference in the fluxes of power across any two spheres
centred on the source is in this case balanced by the change with time of the energy contained inside
the shell bounded by those spheres. These results are relevant not only to long-range transmitters
in communications technology but also to astrophysical objects containing rapidly rotating neutron
stars (such as pulsars) and to the interpretation of the energetics of the multi-wavelength emissions
from sources that lie at cosmological distances (such as radio and gamma-ray bursts). The analysis
presented in this paper is self-contained and supersedes my earlier works on this problem.
