CIZA J2242.8+5301 (`Sausage') and 1RXS J0603.3+4213 (`Toothbrush') are two low-redshift ($z\sim0.2$),
massive ($\sim2\times10^{15}M_\odot$), post-core passage merging clusters, which host shock
waves traced by diffuse radio emission. To study their star-formation properties, we uniformly
survey the `Sausage' and `Toothbrush' clusters in broad and narrow band filters and select a sample
of $201$ and $463$ line emitters, down to a rest-frame equivalent width ($13${\AA}). We robustly
separate between H$\alpha$ and higher redshift emitters using a combination of optical multi-band
(B, g, V, r, i, z) and spectroscopic data. We build H$\alpha$ luminosity functions for the entire
cluster region, near the shock fronts, and away from the shock fronts and find striking differences
between the two clusters. In the dynamically younger, $1$ Gyr old `Sausage' cluster we find numerous
($59$) H$\alpha$ emitters above a star-formation rate (SFR) of $0.17$ M$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ surprisingly
located in close proximity to the shock fronts, embedded in very hot intra-cluster medium plasma.
The SFR density for the cluster population is at least at the level of typical galaxies at $z\sim2$.
Down to the same star-formation rate, the possibly dynamically more evolved `Toothbrush' cluster
has only $9$ H$\alpha$ galaxies. The cluster H$\alpha$ galaxies fall on the SFR-stellar mass relation
$z\sim0.2$ for the field. However, the `Sausage' cluster has an H$\alpha$ emitter density $>20$
times that of blank fields. If the shock passes through gas-rich cluster galaxies, the compressed
gas could collapse into dense clouds and excite star-formation for a few $100$ Myr. This process
ultimately leads to a rapid consumption of the molecular gas, accelerating the transformation
of gas-rich field spirals into cluster S0s or ellipticals.
