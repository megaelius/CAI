Circumbinary discs are generally thought to take up angular momentum and energy from the binary
orbit over time through gravitational torques mediated by orbital resonances. This process leads
to the shrinkage of the binary orbit over time, and is important in a variety of astrophysical contexts
including the orbital evolution of stellar binaries, the migration of planets in protoplanetary
discs, and the evolution of black hole binaries (stellar and supermassive). The merger of compact
object binaries provides a source of gravitational waves in the Universe. Recently, several groups
have reported numerical simulations of circumbinary discs that yield the opposite result, finding
that the binary expands with time. Here we argue that this result is primarily due to the choice of
simulation parameters, made for numerical reasons, which differ from realistic disc parameters
in many cases. We provide physical arguments, and then demonstrate with 3D hydrodynamical simulations,
that thick (high pressure, high viscosity) discs drive sufficient accretion of high angular momentum
material to force binary expansion, while in the more realistic case of thin (low pressure, low viscosity)
discs there is less accretion and the binary shrinks. In the latter case, tides, which generally
transfer angular momentum and energy from the more rapidly rotating object (the binary) to the less
rapidly rotating object (the disc), are the dominant driver of disc-binary evolution. This causes
the binary to shrink. We therefore conclude that for common circumbinary disc parameters, binaries
with non-extreme mass ratios are expected to shrink over time. Expansion of the binary can occur
if the disc viscosity is unusually high, which may occur in the very thick discs encountered in e.g.
circumplanetary discs, super-Eddington AGN, or the outer regions of passive protostellar discs
that are heated by the ... (abridged).
