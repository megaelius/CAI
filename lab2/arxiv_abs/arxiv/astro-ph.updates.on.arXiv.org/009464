We present estimates of stellar population (SP) gradients from stacked spectra of slow (SR) and
fast (FR) rotator elliptical galaxies from the MaNGA-DR15 survey. We find that: 1) FRs are $\sim
5$~Gyrs younger, more metal rich, less $\alpha$-enhanced and more compact than SRs of the same luminosity
$L_r$ and central velocity dispersion $\sigma_0$. Their SP gradients are also different (all quantities
light-weighted from single SP models). 2) One should not ignore the FR/SR dichotomy when studying
galaxy formation and assembly histories. Doing so leads one to conclude that compact galaxies are
older than their larger counterparts of the same mass, even though almost the opposite is true for
FRs and SRs individually. 3) SRs with $\sigma_0\le 250$ km s$^{-1}$ are remarkably homogeneous
within $\sim R_{\rm e}$: they are old, $\alpha$-enhanced and only slightly super-solar in metallicity.
These SRs show no gradients in age and $M_*/L_r$, negative gradients in metallicity, and slightly
positive gradients in [$\alpha$/Fe] (the latter are model dependent). SRs with $\sigma_0\ge 250$
km $s^{-1}$ are slightly younger and more metal rich, contradicting previous work suggesting that
age increases with $\sigma_0$. They also show larger $M_*/L_r$ gradients. 4) Self-consistently
accounting for $M_*/L$ gradients when estimating $M_*$ and $M_{\rm dyn}$ yields good agreement
between the two (gradients reduce $M_{\rm dyn}$ while only slightly increasing $M_*$). Thus, even
for the most massive galaxies, the concordance value for $M_*$ is close to that associated with a
Kroupa (not Salpeter) IMF. 5) The FR population all but disappears above $M_*\ge 3\times 10^{11}M_\odot$,
the same scale at which the size-mass correlation and other scaling relations change. Our results
support the finding that this is an important mass scale which correlates with the environment and
above which mergers matter.
