A long-term multi-purpose observational programme has started with HARPS-N@TNG aimed to characterise
the global architectural properties of exoplanetary systems. In this first paper we fully characterise
the transiting system Qatar-1. We exploit HARPS-N high-precision radial velocity measurements
obtained during a transit to measure the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect in the Qatar-1 system, and
out-of-transit measurements to redetermine the spectroscopic orbit. New photometric transit
light-curves are analysed and a spectroscopic characterisation of the host star atmospheric parameters
is performed based on various methods (line equivalent widths ratios, spectral synthesis, spectral
energy distribution). We achieved a significant improvement in the accuracy of the orbital parameters
and derived the spin-orbit alignment of the system; this information, combined with the spectroscopic
determination of the host star properties, allows us to derive the fundamental physical parameters
for star and planet (masses and radii). The orbital solution for the Qatar-1 system is consistent
with a circular orbit and the system presents a sky-projected obliquity of lambda = -8.4+-7.1 deg.
The planet, with a mass of 1.33+-0.05 M_J, is found to be significantly more massive than previously
reported. The host star is confirmed to be metal-rich ([Fe/H]= 0.20+-0.10) and slowly rotating
(vsinI = 1.7+-0.3 km/s), though moderately active, as indicated by strong chromospheric emission
in the Ca II H&K line cores (logR'_HK about -4.60). The system is well aligned and fits well within
the general lambda vs Teff trend. We definitely rule out any significant orbital eccentricity.
The evolutionary status of the system is inferred based on gyrochronology, and the present orbital
configuration and timescale for orbital decay are discussed in terms of star-planet tidal interactions.
