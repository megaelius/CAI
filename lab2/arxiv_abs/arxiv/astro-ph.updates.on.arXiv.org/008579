While repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) remain scarce in number, they provide a unique opportunity
for follow-up observations that enhance our knowledge of their sources and potentially of the FRB
population as a whole. Attaining more burst spectra could lead to a better understanding of the origin
of these bright, millisecond-duration radio pulses. We therefore performed $\sim$20 hr of simultaneous
observations on FRB 121102 with the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope and the Low Frequency Array
(LOFAR) to constrain the spectral behaviour of bursts from FRB 121102 at 1.4 GHz and 150 MHz. This
campaign resulted in the detection of nine new bursts at 1.4 GHz but no simultaneous detections with
LOFAR. Assuming that the ratio of the fluence at two frequencies scales as a power law, we placed a
lower limit of $\alpha$ > -1.2 $\pm$ 0.4 on the spectral index for the fluence of the instantaneous
broad band emission of FRB 121102. For the derivation of this limit, a realistic fluence detection
threshold for LOFAR was determined empirically assuming a burst would be scattered as predicted
by the NE2001 model. A significant variation was observed in the burst repeat rate R at L-band. During
observations in September 2016, nine bursts were detected, giving R = 1.1 $\pm$ 0.4 hr$^{-1}$, while
in November no bursts were detected, yielding R < 0.3 hr$^{-1}$ (95% confidence limit). This variation
is consistent with earlier seen episodic emission of FRB 121102. In a blind and targeted search,
no bursts were found with LOFAR at 150 MHz, resulting in a repeat rate limit of R < 0.16 hr$^{-1}$ (95%
confidence limit). Burst repeat rate ratios of FRB 121102 at 3, 2, 1.4, and 0.15 GHz are consistent
within the uncertainties with a flattening of its spectrum below 1 GHz.
