(Abridged) Our aim is to identify analogues of gas giant planets, as companions at wide separations
of very young stars. To identify these objects, we cross correlated the Visible and Infrared Survey
Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) Hemisphere Survey (VHS) and the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope
Infrared Deep Sky Survey Galactic Clusters Survey (UKIDSS GCS) catalogues to search for common
proper motion companions to 1195 already known members of Upper Scorpius (USco; age $\sim$5-10
Myr, distance $\sim$145 pc). We present the discovery and spectroscopic characterisation of two
very wide substellar companions of two early-M stars in Upper Scorpius: USco1621 B and USco1556
B. We obtained optical and near-infrared low-resolution spectroscopy of the candidates to characterise
their spectral energy distribution and confirm their membership to the association. We also acquired
adaptive optics images of the primaries and secondaries to search for signs of binarity and close
companions. We determined a spectral type of M8.5 in the optical for both companions, along with
L0 and L0.5 in the near-infrared for USco1621 B and USco1556 B, respectively. The spectra of the two
companions show evident markers of youth. The comparison with theoretical evolutionary models
gives estimated masses of 0.015$\pm$0.002 and 0.014$\pm$0.002 M$_{\odot}$, with temperatures
of 2270$\pm$90 and 2240$\pm$100 K, respectively. The physical separations between the components
of both systems are 2880$\pm$20 and 3500$\pm$40 AU for USco1621 and USco1556 systems, respectively.
We did not find any additional close companion in the adaptive optics images. The probability that
the two secondaries are physically bound to their respective primaries, and not chance alignments
of USco members, is 86%, and the probability that none of them are physically related is 1.0%.
