In connection with a published critique, the author justifies the use of a motionless homogeneous
plane layer of pure hydrogen plasma that is near local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) for analyzing
the characteristics of the radiation from a chromospheric condensation of thickness $\Delta{}z_m=10\text{
km}$ in a gas dynamic model of stellar flares. It is shown that the shock-wave model of flares proposed
by Belova and Bychkov, as opposed to the model of Kostyuk and Pikelner, has irremovable internal
defects owing to exclusion of the interaction between a thermal wave (temperature jump) and a non-stationary
radiative shock. In particular, this model (a) does not make it possible to increase the geometric
thickness of a chromospheric condensation owing to divergence of the fronts of the thermal and shock
waves during impulsive heating, (b) cannot provide heating of the chromospheres of red dwarfs over
significant distances, and (c) predicts $\mathrm{H}_\alpha$ line profiles in conflict with observational
data. It is argued that: (a) the shock-wave model by Belova and Bychkov represents a development
of the kinematic model of solar flares (Nakagawa et al.) and its application to dMe stars, specifically:
a study of the radiative response of the chromosphere of a red dwarf to impulsive heating in the simplest
gas dynamic statement of the problem (a thermal wave is excluded, a stationary approach is used);
(b) in terms of the Kostyuk and Pikelner model, the regions behind the stationary shock fronts do
not correspond to a chromospheric condensation with time-varying thickness but to zones in which
the plasma relaxes to a state of thermal equilibrium. It is emphasized that the separation of the
Kostyuk and Pikelner model into "thermal" and "shock-wave" components is fundamentally impossible.
