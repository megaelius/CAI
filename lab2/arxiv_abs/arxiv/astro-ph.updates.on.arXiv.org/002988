A Revival of the South Equatorial Belt (SEB) is an organised disturbance on a grand scale. It starts
with a single vigorous outbreak from which energetic storms and disturbances spread around the
planet in the different zonal currents. The Revival that began in 2010 was better observed than any
before it. The observations largely validate the historical descriptions of these events: the
major features portrayed therein, albeit at lower resolution, are indeed the large structural
features described here. Our major conclusions about the 2010 SEB Revival are as follows, and we
show that most of them may be typical of SEB Revivals. 1) The Revival started with a bright white plume.
2) The initial plume erupted in a pre-existing cyclonic oval ('barge'). Subsequent white plumes
continued to appear on the track of this barge, which was the location of the sub-surface source of
the whole Revival. 3) These plumes were extremely bright in the methane absorption band, i.e. thrusting
up to very high altitudes, especially when new. 4) Brilliant, methane-bright plumes also appeared
along the leading edge of the central branch. Altogether, 7 plumes appeared at the source and at least
6 along the leading edge. 5) The central branch of the outbreak was composed of large convective cells,
each initiated by a bright plume, which only occupied a part of each cell, while a very dark streak
defined its west edge. 6) The southern branch began with darkening and sudden acceleration of pre-existing
faint spots in a slowly retrograding wave-train. 7) Subsequent darker spots in the southern branch
were complex structures, not coherent vortices. 8) Dark spots in the southern branch had typical
SEBs jetstream speeds but were unusually far south....
