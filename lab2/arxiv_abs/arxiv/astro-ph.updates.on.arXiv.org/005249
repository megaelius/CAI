We report the ultraviolet imaging observation of a jellyfish galaxy obtained at high spatial resolution
(1.3-to-1.5 $Kpc$) using UVIT on board ASTROSAT. Jellyfish galaxies observed in galaxy clusters
are subjected to strong ram-pressure effects that strip the gas from the galaxy. The H$\alpha$ images
of jellyfish galaxies reveal tails of ionized gas extending up to 100 $Kpc$, which could be hosting
ongoing star formation. The star formation in the tentacles of the jellyfish galaxy JO201 in the
Abell 85 galaxy cluster at redshift $\sim$ 0.056 is directly studied from ultraviolet imaging observations.
The intense burst of star formation happening in the tentacles is the focus of the present study.
JO201 is the "UV-brightest cluster galaxy" in Abell 85 with knots and streams of star formation in
the ultraviolet. We identify the star forming knots both in the stripped gas and in the galaxy disk
and compare the features seen in UV with the ones traced by $\mathrm{H}{\alpha}$ emission from data
cubes taken as part of the GASP program using MUSE on the VLT. The UV and $\mathrm{H}{\alpha}$ emission
in main body and along the tentacles of JO201 show a remarkable correlation. We created the $FUV$
extinction map of JO201 using the $\mathrm{H}{\alpha}$ and $\mathrm{H}{\beta}$ flux ratio. The
star formation rates of individual knots are derived from the extinction corrected FUV emission,
which agree very well with those derived from the $\rm H\alpha$ emission, and range from $\sim$ 0.01
-to- 2.07 $M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}$. The integrated star formation rate from $FUV$ flux (SFR$_{FUV}$)
is about $\sim$ 15 M$_{\odot}$/yr, which is rather typical for star forming galaxies of this mass
in the local Universe. We demonstrate that the unprecedented deep UV imaging study of the jellyfish
galaxy JO201 show clear sign of extraplanar star-formation activity, resulting from a recent/ongoing
gas stripping event.
