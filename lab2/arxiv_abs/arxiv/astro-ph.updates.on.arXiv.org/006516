The standard AGN-galaxy co-evolutionary scenario predicts a phase of deeply buried supermassive
black hole growth coexisting with a starburst (SB) before feedback phenomena deplete the cold molecular
gas reservoir of the galaxy and an optically luminous QSO is revealed ('SB-QSO evolutionary sequence').
The aim of this work is to measure the cold gas reservoir of three highly obscured QSOs to test if their
gas fraction is similar to that of sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs), as expected by some models, and
place these measurements in the context of the SB-QSO framework. We target CO(1-0) transition in
BzK4892, a Compton Thick (CT) QSO at z=2.6, CO(1-0) in BzK8608 and CO(2-1) in CDF153, two highly obscured
QSOs at z=2.5 and z=1.5, respectively. For all these targets, we place 3$\sigma$ upper limits on
the CO, with $L'_{CO} < (1.5\div 2.8)\times 10^{10}$ K km/s pc$^2$. We also compare the molecular
gas conditions of our targets with those of other systems at z>1, considering normal star forming
galaxies and SMGs, unobscured and obscured AGN from the literature. For the AGN samples, we provide
an updated and (almost) complete collection of targets with CO follow-up. BzK4892 displays a high
star formation efficiency (SFE$=L_{IR}/L'_{CO}>410$ L$_{\odot}$/(K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$)) and
a gas fraction $f_{gas}<0.1$. Less stringent constraints are derived for the other two targets
($f_{gas}<0.5$ and SFE$>10$). From the comparison with literature data, we found that a) obscured
AGN at z>1 are associated with higher SFE and lower $f_{gas}$ with respect to star forming galaxies;
b) mildly and highly obscured active galaxies have comparable gas fractions; c) the SFE of CT and
obscured AGN are similar to those of unobscured AGN. Within the SB-QSO framework, these findings
could be consistent with a scenario where feedback can impact the host galaxy already from the early
phases of the SB-QSO sequence.
