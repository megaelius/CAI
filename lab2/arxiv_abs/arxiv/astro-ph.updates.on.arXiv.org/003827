The luminosity distance measurement of GW170817 derived from the gravitational wave analysis
in Abbott et al. 2017 (here, A17:H0) is highly correlated with the measured inclination of the NS-NS
system. To improve the precision of the distance measurement, we attempt to constrain the inclination
by modeling the broad-band X-ray-to-radio emission from GW170817, which is dominated by the interaction
of the jet with the environment. We update our previous analysis of the GW170817 afterglow and we
consider the entire radio and X-ray data set obtained at $t<40$ days since merger. We find that the
broad-band X-ray to radio emission from GW170817 is consistent with an off-axis relativistic jet
with kinetic energy $10^{48}\,\rm{erg}<E_{k}\le 3\times 10^{50} \,\rm{erg}$ propagating into
an environment with circumbinary density $n\sim10^{-2}-10^{-4} \,\rm{cm^{-3}}$, with a preference
for wider jets with opening angle $\theta_j=15$ deg. For these jets, our modeling indicates an off-axis
angle $\theta_{\rm obs}\sim25-50$ deg. We combine our constraints on $\theta_{\rm obs}$ with
the joint distance-inclination constraint from A17:H0. Using the same $\sim 170$ km/sec peculiar
velocity uncertainty assumed in A17:H0 but with an inclination constraint from the radio and X-ray
data, we get a value of $H_0=$$74.0 \pm \frac{13.7}{5.3}$ km/s/Mpc, which is higher than the value
of $H_0=$$70.0 \pm \frac{12.0}{8.0}~$ km/s/Mpc found in A17:H0. Further, using a more realistic
peculiar velocity uncertainty of 250 km/sec derived from previous work, we find $H_0=$$75.5 \pm
\frac{14.0}{7.3}$ km/s/Mpc for H0 from this system. We note that this is in modestly better agreement
with the local distance ladder than the Planck CMB, though a significant such discrimination will
require $\sim 50$ such events. Future measurements at $t>100$ days of the X-ray and radio emission
will lead to tighter constraints.
