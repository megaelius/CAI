Using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT), we obtained high-time-resolution measurements
of the full (linear and circular) polarization of the Crab pulsar. Taken at a resolution of 1/8192
of the 34-ms pulse period (i.e., $4.1~\mu{\rm s}$), the 1.38-GHz linear-polarization measurements
are in general agreement with previous lower-time-resolution 1.4-GHz measurements of linear
polarization in the main pulse (MP), in the interpulse (IP), and in the low-frequency component
(LFC). We find the MP and IP to be linearly polarized at about $24\%$ and $21\%$, with no discernible
difference in polarization position angle. However, and contrary to theoretical expectations
and measurements in the visible, we find no evidence for significant variation (sweep) in polarization
position angle over the MP, the IP, or the LFC. Although, the main pulse exhibits a small but statistically
significant quadratic variation in the degree of linear polarization. We discuss the implications
which appear to be in contradiction to theoretical expectations. In addition, we detect weak circular
polarization in the main pulse and interpulse, and strong ($\approx 20\%$) circular polarization
in the low-frequency component, which also exhibits very strong ($\approx 98\%$) linear polarization
at a position angle about $40\degree$ from that of the MP or IP. The pulse-mean polarization properties
are consistent with the LFC being a low-altitude component and the MP and IP being high-altitude
caustic components. Nevertheless, current models for the MP and IP emission do not readily account
for the observed absence of pronounced polarization changes across the pulse. Finally, we measure
IP and LFC pulse phases relative to the MP that are consistent with recent measurements, which have
shown that the phases of these pulse components are evolving with time.
