We investigate small-scale flux cancellations in a young active region observed with the high-resolution
imaging magnetograph IMaX on the Sunrise balloon-borne solar observatory. We identified 11 opposite-polarity
cancelling pairs using an automatic detection code, and derived their statistical properties.We
classified the cancellations into two groups. Class I events are those for which cancellation happens
between a pre-existing large magnetic feature of one polarity and a smaller feature of the other
polarity that emerged/appeared nearby. For Class II events cancellations occur between two pre-existing,
previously unconnected features that converge toward each other. All studied events have an apparent
cancellation time less than 10 minutes and display a significant transient linear polarization
signal along the polarity inversion line. The cancellation events are characterized by a flux decay
rate of about 10$^{15}$~Mx s$^{-1}$. Horizontal convergence speeds of Class II pairs fall between
0.3 and 1.22~km s$^{-1}$. The elements often do not converge directly towards each other, so that
the proper motion speeds of the individual elements is higher, in the range of 1 - 2.7~km s$^{-1}$.
We propose that these cancellation events result from either field-line submergence (Class I),
or reconnection followed by submergence (Class II and/or Class I). Ohmic dissipation of magnetic
energy could also play a role for both classes. We propose that, at least for the Class II events, the
granular motions could possibly be driving magnetic reconnection, rather than the supergranular
motions proposed for the larger cancellation events studied earlier. Specific flux cancellation
rates of the Class II events seem to indicate that they belong to somewhat different category of cancellations
when compared with those studied in SOT/Hinode and MDI/SOHO data.
