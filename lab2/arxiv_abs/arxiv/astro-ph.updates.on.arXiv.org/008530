Magnetic, chemically peculiar stars are known for exhibiting surface abundance inhomogeneities
(chemical spots) that lead to photometric and spectroscopic variability with the rotation period.
It is commonly assumed that the surface structures are causally connected with the global magnetic
field that dominates the photospheric and subphotospheric layers of these stars. As a rule, the
observed magnetic fields show a simple dipole-like geometry, with the magnetic axis being noncollinear
to the rotational one. The present study aims at detecting underlying patterns in the distribution
of photometric spots in a sample of 650 magnetic, chemically peculiar stars and examines their link
to the magnetic field topology. Photometric time-series observations from the ASAS-3 archive
were employed to inspect the light-curve morphology of our sample stars and divide them into representative
classes described using a principal component analysis. Theoretical light curves were derived
from numerous simulations assuming different spot parameters and following the symmetry of a simple
dipole magnetic field. These were subsequently compared with the observed light curves. The results
from our simulations are in contradiction with the observations and predict a much higher percentage
of doublewave light curves than is actually observed. We thereby conclude that the distribution
of the chemical spots does not follow the magnetic field topology, which indicates that the role
of the magnetic field in the creation and maintenance of the surface structures may be more subsidiary
than what is predicted by theoretical studies.
