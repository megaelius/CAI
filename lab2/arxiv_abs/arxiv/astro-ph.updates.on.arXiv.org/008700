We investigate temporally changing variability amplitudes and the multi-periodicity of the type-I
Cepheid Polaris using 162 high-precision radial velocity (RV) and bisector inverse span (BIS)
measurements based on optical spectra recorded using Hermes at the 1.2 m Flemish Mercator telescope
on La Palma, Canary Islands, Spain. Using an empirical template fitting method, we show that Polaris'
RV amplitude has been stable to within $\sim 30 \rm{m s}^{-1}$ between September 2011 and November
2018. We apply the template fitting method to publicly accessible, homogeneous RV data sets from
the literature and provide an updated solution of Polaris' eccentric 29.3 yr orbit. While the inferred
pulsation-induced RV amplitudes differ among individual data sets, we find no evidence for time-variable
RV amplitudes in any of the separately considered, homogeneous data sets. Additionally, we find
that increasing photometric amplitudes determined using SMEI photometry are likely spurious
detections due to as yet ill-understood systematic effects of instrumental origin. Given this
confusing situation, further analysis of high-quality homogeneous data sets with well-understood
systematics is required to confidently establish whether Polaris' variability amplitude is subject
to change over time. We confirm periodic bisector variability periods of 3.97 d and 40.22 d using
Hermes BIS measurements and identify a third signal at a period of 60.17 d. Although the 60.17 d signal
dominates the BIS periodogram, we caution that this signal may not be independent of the 40.22 d signal.
Finally, we show that the 40.22 d signal cannot be explained by stellar rotation. Further long-term,
high-quality spectroscopic monitoring is required to unravel the complete set of Polaris' periodic
signals, which has the potential to provide unprecedented insights into the evolution of Cepheid
variables.
