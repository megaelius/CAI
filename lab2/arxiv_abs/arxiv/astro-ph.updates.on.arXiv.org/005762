We present a statistical study of the planet-metallicity (P-M) correlation, by comparing the 744
stars with candidate planets (SWPs) in the Kepler field which have been observed with LAMOST, and
a sample of distance-independent, fake "twin" stars in the Kepler field with no planet reported
(CKSNPs) yet. With the well-defined and carefully-selected large samples, we find for the first
time a turn-off P-M correlation of Delta [Fe/H]_(SWPs-SNPs), which in average increases from ~0.00+-0.03
dex to 0.06+-0.03 dex, and to 0.12+-0.03 for stars with Earth, Neptune, Jupiter-sized planets successively,
and then declines to ~-0.01+-0.03 dex for more massive planets or brown dwarfs. Moreover, the percentage
of those systems with positive Delta[Fe/H] has the same turn-off pattern. We also find FG-type stars
follow this general trend, but K-type stars are different. Moderate metal enhancement (~0.1-0.2
dex) for K-type stars with planets of radii between 2 to 4 Earth radius as compared to CKSNPs is observed,
which indicates much higher metallicities are required for Super-Earths, Neptune-sized planets
to form around K-type stars. We point out that the P-M correlation is actually metallicity-dependent,
i.e., the correlation is positive at solar and super-solar metallicities, and negative at subsolar
metallicities. No steady increase of Delta[Fe/H] against planet sizes is observed for rocky planets,
excluding the pollution scenario as a major mechanism for the P-M correlation. All these clues suggest
that giant planets probably form differently from rocky planets or more massive planets/brown
dwarfs, and the core-accretion scenario is highly favoured, and high metallicity is a prerequisite
for massive planets to form.
