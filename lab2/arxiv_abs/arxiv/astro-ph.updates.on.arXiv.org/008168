We investigate the ability of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) to discover kilonovae
(kNe) from binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers, focusing on serendipitous
detections in the Wide-Fast-Deep (WFD) survey. We simulate observations of kNe with proposed LSST
survey strategies, paying particular attention to cadence choices that are compatible with the
broader LSST cosmology programme. We find that if all kNe are identical to GW170817, the baseline
survey strategy will yield 58 kNe over the survey lifetime. If we instead assume a representative
population model of BNS kNe, we expect to detect only 27 kNe. However, we find the choice of survey
strategy significantly impacts these numbers and can increase them to 254 kNe and 82 kNe over the
survey lifetime, respectively. This improvement arises from an increased cadence of observations
between different filters with respect to the baseline. We then consider the ability of the Advanced
LIGO/Virgo (ALV) detector network to detect these BNS mergers. If the optimal survey strategy is
adopted, 202 of the GW170817-like kNe and 56 of the BNS population model kNe are detected with LSST
but are below the threshold for detection by the ALV network. This represents, for both models, an
increase by a factor greater than 4.5 in the number of detected sub-threshold events over the baseline
survey strategy. Such a population of sub-threshold events would provide an opportunity to conduct
electromagnetic-triggered searches for signals in gravitational-wave detector data and assess
selection effects in measurements of the Hubble constant from standard sirens, e.g., related to
viewing angle effects.
