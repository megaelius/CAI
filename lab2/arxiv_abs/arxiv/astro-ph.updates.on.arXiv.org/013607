Hydrogen-dominated atmospheres of hot exoplanets expand and escape due to the intense heating
by the X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) irradiation of their host stars. Excess absorption of
neutral hydrogen has been observed in the Ly$\alpha$ line during transits of several close-in exoplanets,
indicating such extended atmospheres. For the hot Jupiter HD 189733b, this absorption shows temporal
variability. Variations in stellar XUV emission and/or stellar wind conditions have been invoked
to explain this effect. We apply a 1D hydrodynamic upper atmosphere model and a 3D MHD stellar wind
flow model to study the effect of variations of the stellar XUV and wind conditions on the neutral
hydrogen distribution, including the production of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs), and the related
Ly$\alpha$ transit signature. We obtain comparable, albeit slightly higher Ly$\alpha$ absorption
as observed in 2011 with a stellar XUV flux of $1.8\times10^4$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, rather typical
activity conditions for this star. Flares similar to the one observed 8 h before the transit are unlikely
to have caused a significant modulation of the transit signature. The resulting Ly$\alpha$ absorption
is dominated by atmospheric broadening, whereas the contribution of ENAs is negligible, as they
are formed inside the bow shock from decelerated wind ions that are heated to high temperatures.
Thus, within our modeling framework and assumptions, we find an insignificant dependence on the
stellar wind parameters. Since the transit absorption can be modeled with typical stellar XUV and
wind conditions, it is possible that the non-detection of the absorption in 2010 was affected by
less typical stellar activity conditions, such as a very different magnitude and/or shape of the
star's spectral XUV emission, or temporal/spatial variations in Ly$\alpha$ affecting the determination
of the transit absorption.
