The gravitational wave source GW190412 is a binary black hole (BBH) merger with three unique properties:
i) its mass ratio is about 0.28, the lowest found so far, ii) it has a relatively high positive effective
spin parameter \chi_eff=0.25, and iii) it is observed to be precessing due to in-plane projected
spin of the binary with an in-plane precession parameter \chi_p=0.3. The two main formation channels
of BBH formation fail to account for GW190412: field formation scenarios cannot explain the observed
precession unless by invoking large natal kicks, and dynamical assembly in dense stellar systems
is inefficient in producing such low mass-ratio BBH mergers. Here, we investigate whether "double
mergers" in wide hierarchical quadruple systems in the "3+1" configuration could explain the unique
properties of GW190412. In this scenario, a compact object quadruple system experiences two mergers:
first, two compact objects in the innermost orbit merge due to secular chaotic evolution. At a later
time, the merged compact object coalesces with another compact object due to secular Lidov-Kozai
oscillations. We find that our scenario is consistent with GW190412. In particular, we find a preferential
projected spin around \chi_p=0.2. However, the likelihood of a double merger is small and the formation
efficiency of these systems is uncertain. If GW190412 originated from a double merger in a 3+1 quadruple,
we find a strong constraint that the first merger likely occurred between roughly equal-mass BHs
in the innermost orbit, since the recoil velocity from unequal-mass BHs would otherwise have disrupted
the system.
