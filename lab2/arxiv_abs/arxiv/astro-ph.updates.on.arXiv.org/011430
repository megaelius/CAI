Correct estimates of stellar extreme ultraviolet (EUV; 100 - 1170 \AA) flux are important for studying
the photochemistry and stability of exoplanet atmospheres, as EUV radiation ionizes hydrogen
and contributes to the heating, expansion, and potential escape of a planet's upper atmosphere.
Contamination from interstellar hydrogen makes observing EUV emission from M stars particularly
difficult, and impossible past 100 pc, and necessitates other means to predict the flux in this wavelength
regime. We present EUV -- infrared (100 \AA - 5.5 $\mu$m) synthetic spectra computed with the PHOENIX
atmospheric code of three early M dwarf planet hosts: GJ 832 (M1.5 V), GJ 176 (M2.5 V), and GJ 436 (M3.5
V). These one-dimensional semiempirical nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium models include
simple temperature prescriptions for the stellar chromosphere and transition region, from where
ultraviolet (UV; 100 - 3008 \AA) fluxes originate. We guide our models with Hubble Space Telescope
far- and near-UV spectra and discuss the ability to constrain these models using Galaxy Evolution
Explorer UV photometry. Our models closely reproduce the observations and predict the unobservable
EUV spectrum at a wavelength resolution of < 0.1 \AA. The temperature profiles that best reproduce
the observations for all three stars are described by nearly the same set of parameters, suggesting
that early M type stars may have similar thermal structures in their upper atmospheres. With an impending
UV observation gap and the scarcity of observed EUV spectra for stars less luminous and more distant
than the Sun, upper-atmosphere models such as these are important for providing realistic spectra
across short wavelengths and for advancing our understanding of the effects of radiation on planets
orbiting M stars.
