This is the second paper of our series to study the effects of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback
on the cosmological evolution of an isolated elliptical galaxy by performing two-dimensional
high-resolution hydrodynamical numerical simulations. In these simulations, the inner boundary
of the simulation is chosen so that the Bondi radius is resolved. Physical processes like star formation,
Type Ia and Type II supernovae are taken into account. Compared to previous works, the main improvements
is that we adopt the most updated AGN physics, which is described in detail in the first paper of this
series (Yuan et al. 2017, Paper I). These improvements include the discrimination of the two accretion
modes of the central AGN and the most updated descriptions of the wind and radiation in the two modes.
In Paper I, we consider the case that the specific angular momentum of the gas in the galaxy is very
low. In this paper, we consider the case where the specific angular momentum of the gas in the galaxy
is significantly higher. In such a large spatial scale, it is believed that some mechanisms such
as asymmetric gravitational torques, plays the role of angular momentum transport. We make use
of the $\alpha$-prescription to mimic such a mechanism. Same as Paper I, we investigate the AGN light
curve, typical AGN lifetime, growth of the black hole mass, AGN duty-cycle, star formation, and
the X-ray surface brightness of the galaxy. Especially, we focus on the effects of specific angular
momentum of the galaxy on these properties. We find that some results are qualitatively similar
to those shown in Paper I, some results such as star formation and black hole growth do show a significant
difference due to the mass concentration in the galactic disk as a consequence of galactic rotation.
