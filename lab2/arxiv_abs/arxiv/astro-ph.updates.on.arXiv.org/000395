We describe new implementations of leptonic and hadronic models for the broadband emission from
relativistic jets in AGN in a temporary steady state. For the leptonic model, a temporary equilibrium
between particle injection/acceleration, radiative cooling, and escape from a spherical emission
region is evaluated, and the self-consistent radiative output is calculated. For the hadronic
model, a temporary equilibrium between particle injection/acceleration, radiative and adiabatic
cooling, and escape is evaluated for both primary electrons and protons. A new, semi-analytical
method to evaluate the radiative output from cascades initiated by internal gamma-gamma pair production
is presented. We use our codes to fit snap-shot spectral energy distributions of a representative
set of Fermi-LAT detected blazars. We find that the leptonic model provides acceptable fits to the
SEDs of almost all blazars with parameters close to equipartition between the magnetic field and
the relativistic electron population. However, the hard gamma-ray spectrum of AO 0235+164, in
contrast to the very steep IR-optical-UV continuum, poses a severe problem for the leptonic model.
If charge neutrality in leptonic models is provided by cold protons, the kinetic energy carried
by the jet should be dominated by protons. We find satisfactory representations of the snapshot
SEDs of most blazars in our sample with the hadronic model presented here. However, in the case of
two quasars the characteristic break at a few GeV energies can not be well modelled. All of our hadronic
model fits require powers in relativistic protons in the range L_p ~ 1e47 - 1e49 erg/s.
