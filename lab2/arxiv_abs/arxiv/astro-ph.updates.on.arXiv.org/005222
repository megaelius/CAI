Gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets are narrow, and thus typically point away from us. They are initially
ultra-relativistic, causing their prompt $\gamma$-ray and early afterglow emission to be beamed
away from us. However, as the jet gradually decelerates its beaming cone widens and eventually reaches
our line of sight and the afterglow emission may be detected. Such orphan afterglows were not clearly
detected so far. Nevertheless, they should be detected in upcoming optical or radio surveys, and
it would be challenging to clearly distinguish between them and other types of transients. Therefore,
we perform detailed, realistic calculations of the expected afterglow emission from GRB jets viewed
at different angles from the jet's symmetry axis. The dynamics are calculated using 2D relativistic
hydrodynamics simulations of jets propagating into different power-law external density profiles,
$\rho_{\rm ext}\propto{}R^{-k}$ for $k=0,\,1,\,1.5,\,2$, ranging from a uniform ISM-like medium
($k=0$) to a stratified steady stellar-wind like profile ($k=2$). We calculate radio, optical
and X-ray lightcurves, and the evolution of the radio afterglow image size, shape and flux centroid.
This may help identify misaligned relativistic jets, whether initially ultra-relativistic and
producing a GRB for observers within their beam, or (possibly intrinsically more common) moderately
relativistic, in either (i) nearby supernovae Ib/c (some of which are associated with long duration
GRBs), or (ii) in binary neutron star mergers, which may produce short duration GRBs, and may also
be detected in gravitational waves (e.g. GW$\,$170827/GRB$\,$170817A with a weak prompt $\gamma$-ray
emission may harbor an off-axis jet).
