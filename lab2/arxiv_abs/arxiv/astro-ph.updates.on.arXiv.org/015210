We measure the projected number density profiles of galaxies and the splashback feature in clusters
selected by the Sunyaev--Zeldovich (SZ) effect from the Advanced Atacama Cosmology Telescope
(AdvACT) survey using galaxies observed by the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The splashback radius
for the complete galaxy sample is consistent with theoretical measurements from CDM-only simulations,
and is located at $2.4^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$ Mpc $h^{-1}$. We split the sample based on galaxy color and
find significant differences in the profile shapes. Red galaxies and those in the green valley show
a splashback-like minimum in their slope profile consistent with theoretical predictions, while
the bluest galaxies show a weak feature that appears at a smaller radius. We develop a mapping of galaxies
to subhalos in $N$-body simulations by splitting subhalos based on infall time onto the cluster
halos. We find that the location of the steepest slope and differences in the shapes of the profiles
can be mapped to differences in the average time of infall of galaxies of different colors. The minima
of the slope in the galaxy profiles trace a discontinuity in the phase space of dark matter halos.
By relating spatial profiles to infall time for galaxies of different colours, we can use splashback
as a clock to understand galaxy quenching. We find that red galaxies have on average been in their
clusters for over $3.2 ~\rm Gyrs$, green galaxies about $2.2 ~\rm Gyrs$, while blue galaxies have
been accreted most recently and have not reached apocenter. Using the information from the complete
radial profiles, we fit a simple quenching model and find that the onset of galaxy quenching in clusters
occurs after a delay of about a gigayear, and that galaxies quench rapidly thereafter with an exponential
timescale of $0.6$ Gyr.
