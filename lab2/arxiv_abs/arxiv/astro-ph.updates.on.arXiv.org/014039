We present time-of-arrival measurements and timing models of 47 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) observed
from 2004 to 2017 at the Arecibo Observatory and the Green Bank Telescope by the North American Nanohertz
Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav). The observing cadence was three to four weeks
for most pulsars over most of this time span, with weekly observations of six sources. These data
were collected for use in low-frequency gravitational wave searches and for other astrophysical
purposes. We detail our observational methods and present a set of time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements,
based on "narrowband" analysis, in which many TOAs are calculated within narrow radio-frequency
bands for data collected simultaneously across a wide bandwidth. A separate set of "wideband" TOAs
will be presented in a companion paper. We detail a number of methodological changes compared to
our previous work which yield a cleaner and more uniformly processed data set. Our timing models
include several new astrometric and binary pulsar measurements, including previously unpublished
values for the parallaxes of PSRs J1832-0836 and J2322+2057, the secular derivatives of the projected
semi-major orbital axes of PSRs J0613-0200 and J2229+2643, and the first detection of the Shapiro
delay in PSR J2145-0750. We report detectable levels of red noise in the time series for fourteen
pulsars. As a check on timing model reliability, we investigate the stability of astrometric parameters
across data sets of different lengths. We report flux density measurements for all pulsars observed.
Searches for stochastic and continuous gravitational waves using these data will be subjects of
forthcoming publications.
