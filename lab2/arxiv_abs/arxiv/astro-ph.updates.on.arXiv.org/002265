In order to determine the location of the gamma-ray emission site in blazars, we investigate the
time-domain relationship between their radio and gamma-ray emission. Light-curves for the brightest
detected blazars from the first 3 years of the mission of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope are
cross-correlated with 4 years of 15GHz observations from the OVRO 40-m monitoring program. The
large sample and long light-curve duration enable us to carry out a statistically robust analysis
of the significance of the cross-correlations, which is investigated using Monte Carlo simulations
including the uneven sampling and noise properties of the light-curves. Modeling the light-curves
as red noise processes with power-law power spectral densities, we find that only one of 41 sources
with high quality data in both bands shows correlations with significance larger than 3-sigma (AO
0235+164), with only two more larger than even 2.25-sigma (PKS 1502+106 and B2 2308+34). Additionally,
we find correlated variability in Mrk 421 when including a strong flare that occurred in July-September
2012. These results demonstrate very clearly the difficulty of measuring statistically robust
multiwavelength correlations and the care needed when comparing light-curves even when many years
of data are used. This should be a caution. In all four sources the radio variations lag the gamma-ray
variations, suggesting that the gamma-ray emission originates upstream of the radio emission.
Continuous simultaneous monitoring over a longer time period is required to obtain high significance
levels in cross-correlations between gamma-ray and radio variability in most blazars.
