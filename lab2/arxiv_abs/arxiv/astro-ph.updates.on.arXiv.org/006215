The identification and characterisation of low-mass binaries is of importance for a range of astrophysical
investigations. Low-mass binaries in young ($\sim10 - 100 $ Myr) moving groups (YMGs) are of particular
significance as they provide unique opportunities to calibrate stellar models and evaluate the
ages and coevality of the groups themselves. Low-mass M-dwarfs have pre-main sequence life times
on the order of $\sim100$ Myr and therefore are continually evolving along a mass-luminosity track
throughout the YMG phase, providing ideal laboratories for precise isochronal dating, if a model-independent
dynamical mass can be measured. AstraLux lucky imaging multiplicity surveys have recently identified
hundreds of new YMG low-mass binaries, where a subsample of M-dwarf multiples have estimated orbital
periods less than 50 years. We have conducted a radial velocity survey of a sample of 29 such targets
to complement the astrometric data. This will allow enhanced orbital determinations and precise
dynamical masses to be derived in a shorter timeframe than possible with astrometric monitoring
alone, and allow for a more reliable isochronal analysis. Here we present radial velocity measurements
for our sample over several epochs. We report the detection of the three-component spectroscopic
multiple 2MASS J05301858-5358483, for which the C component is a new discovery, and forms a tight
pair with the B component. Originally identified as a YMG member, we find that this system is a likely
old field interloper, whose high chromospheric activity level is caused by tidal spin-up of the
tight BC pair. Two other triple systems with a tight pair exist in the sample, but for the rest of the
targets we find that additional tidally synchronized companions are highly unlikely, providing
further evidence that their high chromospheric activity levels are generally signatures of youth.
