Context: Diffusion of species on the dust surface is a key process for determining the chemical composition
of interstellar ices. On the dust surface, adsorbed species diffuse from one potential well to another
and react with other adsorbed reactants, resulting in the formation of simple and complex molecules.
Aims: We study the impact on the abundances of the species simulated by the chemical codes by considering
the uncertainties in the diffusion energy of adsorbed species. We aim to limit the uncertainties
in the abundances as calculated by chemical codes by identifying the surface species that result
in a larger error because of the uncertainties in their diffusion energy. Methods: We ran various
cases with 2000 to 10000 simulations in each case and varied the diffusion energies of some or all
surface species randomly. We calculated Pearson correlation coefficients between the abundances
and the ratio of diffusion to binding energy of adsorbed species. We identified the species that
introduce maximum uncertainty in the ice and gas-phase abundances. With these species we ran three
sets, with 2000 simulations in each, to quantify the uncertainties they introduce. Results: We
present the abundances of various molecules in the gas phase and also on the dust surface at different
time intervals during the simulation. We show which species produce a large uncertainty in the abundances.
We sorted species into different groups in accordance with their importance in propagating uncertainty
in the chemical network. Conclusions: We show that CO, H$_2$, O, N, and CH$_3$ are the key species
for uncertainties in the abundances, while CH$_2$, HCO, S and O$_2$ come next, followed by NO, HS,
and CH. We also show that by limiting the uncertainties in the ratio of diffusion to binding energy
of these species, we can eliminate the uncertainties in the gas-phase abundances of almost all the
species.
