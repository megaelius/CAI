Context: Multiple stellar systems are unique laboratories for astrophysics. Analysis of their
orbital dynamics may reveal invaluable information about the physical properties of the participating
stars. Unfortunately, there are only a few known and well described multiple systems, this is even
more so for systems located outside the Milky Way galaxy. A particularly interesting situation
occurs when the inner binary in a compact triple system is eclipsing. This is because the stellar
interaction, typically resulting in precession of orbital planes, may be observable as a variation
of depth of the eclipses on a long timescale. Aims: We aim to present a novel method to determine compact
triples using publicly available photometric data from large surveys. Here we apply it to eclipsing
binaries (EBs) in Magellanic Clouds from OGLE III database. Methods: We analyzed light curves (LCs)
of 26121 LMC and 6138 SMC EBs with the goal to identify those for which the orbital inclination varies
in time. Archival LCs of the selected systems, when complemented by our own observations with Danish
1.54m telescope, were thoroughly analyzed using the PHOEBE program. Time dependence of the EB's
inclination was described using the theory of orbital-plane precession. By observing the parameter-dependence
of the precession rate, we were able to constrain the third companion mass and its orbital period
around EB. Results: We identified 58 candidates of new compact triples in Magellanic Clouds. This
is the largest published sample of such systems so far. Eight of them were analyzed thoroughly and
physical parameters of inner binary were determined together with an estimation of basic characteristics
of the third star. These data may provide important clues about stellar formation mechanisms for
objects with different metalicity than found in our galactic neighborhood.
