Galaxy spectra are essential to probe the spatial distribution of galaxies in our Universe. To better
interpret current and future spectroscopic galaxy redshift surveys, it is important to be able
to simulate these data sets. We describe Uspec, a forward modeling tool to generate galaxy spectra
taking into account intrinsic galaxy properties as well as instrumental responses of a given telescope.
The model for the intrinsic properties of the galaxy population was developed in an earlier work
for broad-band imaging surveys [1]. We apply Uspec to the SDSS/CMASS sample of Luminous Red Galaxies
(LRGs). We construct selection cuts that match those used to build this LRG sample, which we then
apply to data and simulations in the same way. The resulting real and simulated average spectra show
a very good agreement overall, with the simulated one showing a slightly bluer galaxy population.
For a quantitative comparison, we perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the sets of spectra.
By comparing the PCs constructed from simulations and data, we find very good agreement for the first
four components, and moderate for the fifth. The distributions of the eigencoefficients also show
an appreciable overlap. We are therefore able to properly simulate the LRG sample taking into account
the SDSS/BOSS instrumental responses. The small residual differences between the two samples
can be ascribed to the intrinsic properties of the simulated galaxy population, which can be reduced
by adjusting the model parameters in the future. This provides good prospects for the forward modeling
of upcoming large spectroscopic surveys.
