Supernova remnants (SNRs) that contain pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are characterized by distinct
evolutionary stages. In very young systems, the PWN drives a shock into the innermost supernova
(SN) material, giving rise to low-excitation lines and an infrared (IR) continuum from heated dust
grains. These observational signatures make it possible to cleanly measure the properties of the
deepest SN ejecta layers that can, in turn, provide constraints on the SN progenitor. We present
Herschel Space Observatory far-IR observations of the PWN in the Galactic SNR Kes 75, containing
the youngest known pulsar that exhibited magnetar-like activity. We detect highly-broadened
oxygen and carbon line emission that arises from the SN ejecta encountered by the PWN. We also detect
a small amount (a few thousandths of a solar mass) of shock-heated dust that spatially coincides
with the ejecta material and was likely formed in the SN explosion. We use hydrodynamical models
to simulate the evolution of Kes 75 and find that the PWN has so far swept up 0.05-0.1 solar masses of
SN ejecta. Using explosion and nucleosynthesis models for different progenitor masses in combination
with shock models, we compare the predicted far-IR emission with the observed line intensities
and find that lower mass and explosion energy SN progenitors with mildly mixed ejecta profiles and
comparable abundance fractions of carbon and oxygen are favored over higher mass ones. We conclude
that Kes 75 likely resulted from an 8-12 solar-mass progenitor, providing further evidence that
lower energy explosions of such progenitors can give rise to magnetars.
