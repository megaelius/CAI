eROSITA, launched on 13 July 2019, will be completing the first all-sky survey in the soft and medium
X-ray band in nearly three decades. This 4-year survey, finishing in late 2023, will present a rich
legacy for the entire astrophysics community and complement upcoming multi-wavelength surveys
(with, e.g. the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and the Dark Energy Survey). Besides the major scientific
aim to study active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galaxy clusters, eROSITA will contribute significantly
to X-ray studies of normal (i.e., not AGN) galaxies. Starting from multi-wavelength catalogues,
we measure star formation rates and stellar masses for 60 212 galaxies constrained to distances
of 50-200 Mpc. We chose this distance range to focus on the relatively unexplored volume outside
the local Universe, where galaxies will be largely spatially unresolved and probe a range of X-ray
luminosities that overlap with the low luminosity and/or highly obscured AGN population. We use
the most recent X-ray scaling relations as well as the on-orbit eROSITA instrument performance
to predict the X-ray emission from XRBs and diffuse hot gas and to perform both an analytic prediction
and an end-to-end simulation using the mission simulation software, SIXTE. We consider potential
contributions from hidden AGN and comment on the impact of normal galaxies on the measurement of
the faint end of the AGN luminosity function. We predict that the eROSITA 4-year survey, will detect
$\gtrsim$ 15 000 galaxies (3 $\sigma$ significance) at 50-200 Mpc, which is ~100X more normal galaxies
than detected in any X-ray survey to date.
