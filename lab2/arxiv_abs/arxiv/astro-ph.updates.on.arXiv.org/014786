The ionization fraction plays a key role in the physics and chemistry of the neutral interstellar
medium, from controlling the coupling of the gas to the magnetic field to allowing fast ion-neutral
reactions that drive interstellar chemistry. Most estimations of the ionization fraction have
relied on deuterated species such as DCO+, whose detection is limited to dense cores representing
an extremely small fraction of the volume of the giant molecular clouds they are part of. As large
field-of-view hyperspectral maps become available, new tracers may be found. We search for the
best observable tracers of the ionization fraction based on a grid of astrochemical models. We build
grids of models that sample randomly a large space of physical conditions (unobservable quantities
such as gas density, temperature, etc.) and compute the corresponding observables (line intensities,
column densities) and the ionization fraction. We estimate the predictive power of each potential
tracer by training a Random Forest model to predict the ionization fraction from that tracer, based
on these model grids. In both translucent medium and cold dense medium conditions, several observable
tracers with very good predictive power for the ionization fraction are found. Several tracers
in cold dense medium conditions are found to be better and more widely applicable than the traditional
DCO+/HCO+ ratio. We also provide simpler analytical fits for estimating the ionization fraction
from the best tracers, and for estimating the associated uncertainties. We discuss the limitations
of the present study and select a few recommended tracers in both types of conditions. The method
presented here is very general and can be applied to the measurement of any other quantity of interest
(cosmic ray flux, elemental abundances, etc.) from any type of model (PDR models, time-dependent
chemical models, etc.). (abridged)
