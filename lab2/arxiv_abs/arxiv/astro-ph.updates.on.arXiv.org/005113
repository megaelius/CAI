We perform a comprehensive analysis of the most common early- and late-Universe solutions to the
$H_0$, Ly-$\alpha$, and $S_8$ discrepancies. When considered on their own, massive neutrinos
provide a natural solution to the $S_8$ discrepancy at the expense of increasing the $H_0$ tension.
If all extensions are considered simultaneously, the best-fit solution has a neutrino mass sum
of $\sim 0.4$ eV, a dark energy equation of state close to that of a cosmological constant, and no additional
relativistic degrees of freedom. However, the $H_0$ tension, while weakened, remains unresolved.
Motivated by this result, we perform a non-parametric reconstruction of the evolution of the dark
energy fluid density (allowing for negative energy densities), together with massive neutrinos.
When all datasets are included, there exists a residual $\sim1.9\sigma$ tension with $H_0$. If
this residual tension remains in the future, it will indicate that it is not possible to solve the
$H_0$ tension solely with a modification of the late-Universe dynamics within standard general
relativity. However, we do find that it is possible to resolve the tension if either galaxy BAO or
JLA supernovae data are omitted. We find that \textit{negative} dark energy densities are favored
near redshift $z\sim2.35$ when including the Ly-$\alpha$ BAO measurement (at $\sim 2\sigma$).
This behavior may point to a negative curvature, but it is most likely indicative of systematics
or at least an underestimated covariance matrix. Quite remarkably, we find that in the extended
cosmologies considered in this work, the neutrino mass sum is always close to $0.4$ eV regardless
of the choice of external datasets, as long as the $H_0$ tension is solved or significantly decreased.
