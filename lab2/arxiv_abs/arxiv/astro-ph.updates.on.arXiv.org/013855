Recently the IceCube collaboration detected very high energy (VHE) neutrinos and associated them
with the blazar \txs{}, raising a possible association of VHE neutrinos with this and other individual
blazars. Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) is so far the only technique enabling the imaging
of the innermost jet at milli-arcsec resolution (parsec scale), where the high energy emission
possibly originates from. Here, we report on the radio properties of the parsec scale jet in \txs{}
derived from the analysis of multi-epoch multi-frequency archive VLBI data. The half opening angle
of the jet beam is about 3.8\degr, and the jet inclination angle is about 20\degr. The overall jet
structure shows a helical trajectory with a precessing period of 5--6 years, likely originating
from instabilities operating at parsec scales. The calculated beaming parameters (Doppler boosting
factor, bulk Lorentz factor) suggest a moderately relativistic jet. The pc-scale magnetic field
strength is estimated in the contexts of core-shift and variability, and is in general agreement
in the range of 0.2 - 0.7 G. And it is found to decrease from a relatively larger value during the quiescent
period before the ongoing flare. This suggests a conversion of magnetic field energy density to
particle energy density that help accelerate injected particles at the jet base and result in variable
shocked emission. The neutrino event could be associated with the onset of energetic particle injection
into the jet. This scenario then supports the lepto-hadronic origin of the VHE neutrinos and $\gamma$-ray
emission owing to a co-spatial origin.
