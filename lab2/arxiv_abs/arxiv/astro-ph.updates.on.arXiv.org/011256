There is significant observational evidence that a large fraction of galactic centers, including
those in the Milky Way and M31, host a supermassive black hole (SMBH) embedded in a triaxial nuclear
star cluster. In this work, we study the secular orbital evolution of binaries in these environments,
and characterize the regions and morphological properties of nuclear star clusters that lead to
gravitational wave mergers and/or tidal captures. We show that even a modest level of triaxiality
in the density distribution of a cluster (an ellipsoid with axis ratios of 0.7 and 0.95) dramatically
enhances the merger rates in the central parsecs of the Galaxy by a factor of up to ~10-30 relative
to a spherical density distribution. Moreover, we show that the merger fraction of binaries with
semi-major axes in the range 10-100 AU remains above 10% for the entire central parsec of the cluster,
reaching values close to unity at a distance of ~0.2-0.4 pc from the SMBH. We understand this large
merger efficiency in terms of two distinct mechanisms: i) eccentricity oscillations driven by
the dominant axisymmetric part of the cluster potential that are enhanced by the slow modulation
of a binary's angular momentum from the triaxial contribution, similar to the well-known octupole-level
dynamics in three-body systems; ii) chaotic diffusion of eccentricities arising when the nodal
precession timescale of a binary's orbit about the SMBH becomes comparable to its characteristic
secular timescale. Overall, our results indicate that galactic centers are significantly more
collisional than previously thought, with mergers taking place up to the effective radii of their
nuclear star clusters.
