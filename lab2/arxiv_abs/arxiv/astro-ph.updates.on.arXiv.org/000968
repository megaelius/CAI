We study the incorporation of gravity into the trace dynamics framework for classical matrix-valued
fields, from which we have proposed that quantum field theory is the emergent thermodynamics, with
state vector reduction arising from fluctuation corrections to this thermodynamics. We show that
the metric must be incorporated as a classical, not a matrix-valued, field, with the source for gravity
the exactly covariantly conserved trace stress-energy tensor of the matter fields. We then study
corrections to the classical gravitational action induced by the dynamics of the matrix-valued
matter fields, by examining the average over the trace dynamics canonical ensemble of the matter
field action, in the presence of a general background metric. Using constraints from global Weyl
scaling and three-space general coordinate transformations, we show that to zeroth order in derivatives
of the metric, the induced gravitational action in the preferred rest frame of the trace dynamics
canonical ensemble must have the form $$ \Delta S=\int d^4x (^{(4)}g)^{1/2}(g_{00})^{-2} A\big(g_{0i}
g_{0j} g^{ij}/g_{00}, D^ig_{ij}D^j/g_{00}, g_{0i}D^i/g_{00}\big), $$ with $D^i$ defined through
the co-factor expansion of $^{(4)}g$ by $^{(4)}g/{^{(3)}g}=g_{00}+g_{0i}D^i$, and with $A(x,y,z)$
a general function of its three arguments. This action has "chameleon-like" properties: For the
Robertson-Walker cosmological metric, it {\it exactly} reduces to a cosmological constant, but
for the Schwarzschild metric it diverges as $(1-2M/r)^{-2}$ near the Schwarzschild radius, indicating
that it will substantially affect the horizon structure.
