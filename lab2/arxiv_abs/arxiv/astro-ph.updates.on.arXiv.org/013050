We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to investigate how the specific
star formation rates (sSFRs) of massive galaxies $(M_* > 10^{10} M_\odot)$ depend on the distance
to their closest companions. We estimate sSFR enhancements by comparing with control samples that
are matched in redshift, stellar mass, local density and isolation, and we restrict our analysis
to pairs with stellar mass ratios of 0.1 to 10. At small separations (~15 kpc), the mean sSFR is enhanced
by a factor of 2.0 $\pm$ 0.1 in the flagship (110.7 Mpc)$^3$ simulation (TNG100-1). Statistically
significant enhancements extend out to 3D separations of 280 kpc in the (302.6 Mpc)$^3$ simulation
(TNG300-1). We find similar trends in the EAGLE and Illustris simulations, although their sSFR
enhancements are lower than those in TNG100-1 by about a factor of two. Enhancements in IllustrisTNG
galaxies are seen throughout the redshift range explored ($0 \leq z < 1$), with the strength of the
enhancements decreasing with increasing redshift for galaxies with close companions. In order
to more closely compare with observational results, we separately consider 2D projected distances
between galaxies in IllustrisTNG. We detect significant sSFR enhancements out to projected separations
of 260 kpc in TNG300-1, with projection effects diluting the size of the enhancements by about 20
per cent below 50 kpc. We find similar sSFR enhancements in TNG100-1 and Sloan Digital Sky Survey
galaxies, with enhancements extending out to projected separations of about 150 kpc for star-forming
galaxies at $z < 0.2$. Finally, by summing over all separations, we estimate that the presence of
closest companions boosts the average sSFR of massive galaxies in TNG100-1 by 14.5 per cent.
