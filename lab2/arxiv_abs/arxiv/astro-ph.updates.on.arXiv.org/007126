With the recent discovery of a dozen dusty star-forming galaxies and around 30 quasars at z>5 that
are hyper-luminous in the infrared ($\mu$$L_{\rm IR}>10^{13}$ L$_{\odot}$, where $\mu$ is a lensing
magnification factor), the possibility has opened up for SPICA, the proposed ESA M5 mid-/far-infrared
mission, to extend its spectroscopic studies toward the epoch of reionization and beyond. In this
paper, we examine the feasibility and scientific potential of such observations with SPICA's far-infrared
spectrometer SAFARI, which will probe a spectral range (35-230 $\mu$m) that will be unexplored
by ALMA and JWST. Our simulations show that SAFARI is capable of delivering good-quality spectra
for hyper-luminous infrared galaxies (HyLIRGs) at z=5-10, allowing us to sample spectral features
in the rest-frame mid-infrared and to investigate a host of key scientific issues, such as the relative
importance of star formation versus AGN, the hardness of the radiation field, the level of chemical
enrichment, and the properties of the molecular gas. From a broader perspective, SAFARI offers
the potential to open up a new frontier in the study of the early Universe, providing access to uniquely
powerful spectral features for probing first-generation objects, such as the key cooling lines
of low-metallicity or metal-free forming galaxies (fine-structure and H2 lines) and emission
features of solid compounds freshly synthesized by Population III supernovae. Ultimately, SAFARI's
ability to explore the high-redshift Universe will be determined by the availability of sufficiently
bright targets (whether intrinsically luminous or gravitationally lensed). With its launch expected
around 2030, SPICA is ideally positioned to take full advantage of upcoming wide-field surveys
such as LSST, SKA, Euclid, and WFIRST, which are likely to provide extraordinary targets for SAFARI.
