We present evidence for a new two-planet system around the giant star HD202696 (= HIP105056, BD+26
4118). The discovery is based on public HIRES radial velocity measurements taken at Keck Observatory
between July 2007 and September 2014. We estimate a stellar mass of 1.91$^{+0.09}_{-0.14}M_\odot$
for HD202696, which is located close to the base of the red giant branch. A two-planet self-consistent
dynamical modeling MCMC scheme of the radial velocity data followed by a long-term stability test
suggests planetary orbital periods of $P_{\rm b}$ = 517.8$_{-3.9}^{+8.9}$ days and $P_{\rm c}$
= 946.6$_{-20.9}^{+20.7}$ days, eccentricities of $e_{\rm b}$ = 0.011$_{-0.011}^{+0.078}$
and $e_{\rm c}$ = 0.028$_{-0.012}^{+0.065}$ , and minimum dynamical masses of $m_{\rm b}$ = 2.00$_{-0.10}^{+0.22}$\,$M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$
and $m_{\rm c}$ = 1.86$_{-0.23}^{+0.18}$,$M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$, respectively. Our stable MCMC
samples are consistent with orbital configurations predominantly in a mean period ratio of 11:6
and its close-by high order mean-motion commensurabilities with low eccentricities. For the majority
of the stable configurations we find an aligned or anti-aligned apsidal libration (i.e.\ $\Delta\omega$
librating around 0$^\circ$ or 180$^\circ$), suggesting that the HD202696 system is likely dominated
by secular perturbations near the high-order 11:6 mean-motion resonance. The HD202696 system
is yet another Jovian mass pair around an intermediate mass star with a period ratio below the 2:1
mean motion resonance. Therefore, the HD202696 system is an important discovery, which may shed
light on the primordial disk-planet properties needed for giant planets to break the strong 2:1
mean motion resonance and settle in more compact orbits.
