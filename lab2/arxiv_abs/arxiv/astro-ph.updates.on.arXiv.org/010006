For extremely large telescopes, adaptive optics will be required to correct the Earth's turbulent
atmosphere. The performance of tomographic adaptive optics is strongly dependent on the vertical
distribution (profile) of this turbulence. An important way in which this manifests is the tomographic
error, arising from imperfect measurement and reconstruction of the turbulent phase at altitude.
Conventionally, a small number of reference profiles are used to obtain this error in simulation
however these profiles are not constructed to be representative in terms of tomographic error.
It is therefore unknown whether these simulations are providing realistic performance estimates.
Here, we employ analytical adaptive optics simulation that drastically reduces computation times
to compute tomographic error for 10 691 measurements of the turbulence profile gathered by the Stereo-SCIDAR
instrument at ESO Paranal. We assess for the first time the impact of the profile on tomographic error
in a statistical manner. We find, in agreement with previous work, that the tomographic error is
most directly linked with the distribution of turbulence into discrete, stratified layers. Reference
profiles are found to provide mostly higher tomographic error than expected, which we attribute
to the fact that these profiles are primarily composed of averages of many measurements resulting
in unrealistic, continuous distributions of turbulence. We propose that a representative profile
should be defined with respect to a particular system, and that as such simulations with a large statistical
sample of profiles must be an important step in the design process.
