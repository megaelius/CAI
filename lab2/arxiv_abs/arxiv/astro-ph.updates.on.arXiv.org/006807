Atmospheric regions below a refractive boundary are hidden in limb observations. Refraction thus
creates a gray continuum in the planet's transmission spectrum which can hide spectral features
associated with sources of atmospheric opacity. We combine refractive theory with recent analytical
advances describing the effects of surfaces and clouds on transmission spectra, to express the
location of this boundary in atmospheric opacity space, both for atomic and molecular extinction,
as well as collision-induced absorption. This allows one to quickly estimate how refraction affects
spectral features in well-mixed atmospheres. We show that differences in the geometry of limb observations
between solar system planets and exoplanets leads to different locations of this boundary, and
that more than four extra scale heights of atmosphere are hidden in exoplanet transits compared
to solar system observations of cold gas giants. We explore how the location of this refractive boundary
in exoplanet transits changes in a well-mixed isothermal atmosphere with its temperature and composition,
the spectral type of the planet's host star, and the size of the planet. We demonstrate that five extra
scale heights of atmosphere are hidden in a terrestrial planet with a CO$_2$ atmosphere compared
to a helium atmosphere, resulting in a flatter spectrum than from its smaller scale height alone.
We provide results for a few exoplanets, notably those in the TRAPPIST-1 system, to help the scientific
community estimate the impact of refraction on the size of spectral features without radiative
transfer calculations, and thus help refine planned James Web Space Telescope observations.
