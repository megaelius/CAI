In this second paper of a series, we discuss the dynamics of a plasma entering the precursor of an unmagnetized,
relativistic collisionless pair shock. We discuss how this background plasma is decelerated and
heated through its interaction with a microturbulence that results from the growth of a current
filamentation instability (CFI) in the shock precursor. We make use, in particular, of the reference
frame $\mathcal R_{\rm w}$ in which the turbulence is mostly magnetic. This frame moves at relativistic
velocities towards the shock front at rest, decelerating gradually from the far to the near precursor.
In a first part, we construct a fluid model to derive the deceleration law of the background plasma
expected from the scattering of suprathermal particles off the microturbulence. This law leads
to the relationship $\gamma_{\rm p}\,\sim\,\xi_{\rm b}^{-1/2}$ between the background plasma
Lorentz factor $\gamma_{\rm p}$ and the normalized pressure of the beam $\xi_{\rm b}$; it is found
to match nicely the spatial profiles observed in large-scale 2D3V particle-in-cell simulations.
In a second part, we model the dynamics of the background plasma at the kinetic level, incorporating
the inertial effects associated with the deceleration of $\mathcal R_{\rm w}$ into a Vlasov-Fokker-Planck
equation for pitch-angle diffusion. We show how the effective gravity in $\mathcal R_{\rm w}$ drives
the background plasma particles through friction on the microturbulence, leading to efficient
plasma heating. Finally, we compare a Monte Carlo simulation of our model with dedicated PIC simulations
and conclude that it can satisfactorily reproduce both the heating and the deceleration of the background
plasma in the shock precursor, thereby providing a successful 1D description of the shock transition
at the microscopic level.
