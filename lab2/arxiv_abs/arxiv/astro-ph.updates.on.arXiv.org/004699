Context. From stars to active galactic nuclei, many astrophysical systems are surrounded by an
equatorial distribution of dusty material that are, in a number of cases, spatially unresolved
even with cutting edge facilities. Aims. In this paper, we investigate if and how one can determine
the unresolved and heterogeneous morphology of dust distribution around a central bright source
using time-resolved polarimetric observations. Methods. We use polarized radiative transfer
simulations to study a sample of circumnuclear dusty morphologies. We explore a grid of uniform,
fragmented, density-stratified, geometrically-variable models in the near-infrared, optical
and ultraviolet bands, and present their distinctive time-dependent polarimetric signatures.
Results. As expected, varying the structure of the obscuring equatorial disk has a deep impact on
the inclination-dependent flux, polarization degree and angle, and time-lags we observe. We find
that stratified media are distinguishable by time-resolved polarimetric observations, and that
the expected polarization is much higher in the infrared band than in the ultraviolet. However,
due to the physical scales imposed by dust sublimation, the average time-lags between the total
and polarized fluxes are important (months to years), lengthening the observational campaigns
necessary to break more sophisticated (and therefore also more degenerated) models. In the ultraviolet
band, time-lags are slightly shorter than in the infrared or optical bands, and, coupled to lower
diluting starlight fluxes, time-resolved polarimetry in the UV appears more promising for future
campaigns.
