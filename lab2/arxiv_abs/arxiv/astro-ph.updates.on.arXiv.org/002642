We present fundamental stellar parameters and chemical abundances for a sample of 86 evolved stars
with planets and for a control sample of 137 stars without planets. The analysis was based on both
high S/N and resolution echelle spectra. The goals of this work are i) to investigate chemical differences
between stars with and without planets; ii) to explore potential differences between the properties
of the planets around giants and subgiants; and iii) to search for possible correlations between
these properties and the chemical abundances of their host stars. In agreement with previous studies,
we find that subgiants with planets are, on average, more metal-rich than subgiants without planets
by ~ 0.16 dex. The [Fe/H] distribution of giants with planets is centered at slightly subsolar metallicities
and there is no metallicity enhancement relative to the [Fe/H] distribution of giants without planets.
Furthermore, contrary to recent results, we do not find any clear difference between the metallicity
distributions of stars with and without planets for giants with M > 1.5 Msun. With regard to the
other chemical elements, the analysis of the [X/Fe] distributions shows differences between giants
with and without planets for some elements, particularly V, Co, and Ba. Analyzing the planet properties,
some interesting trends might be emerging: i) multi-planet systems around evolved stars show a
slight metallicity enhancement compared with single-planet systems; ii) planets with a $\lesssim$
0.5 AU orbit subgiants with [Fe/H] > 0 and giants hosting planets with a $\lesssim$ 1 AU have [Fe/H]
< 0; iii) higher-mass planets tend to orbit more metal-poor giants with M < 1.5 Msun, whereas
planets around subgiants seem to follow the planet-mass metallicity trend observed on dwarf hosts;
iv) planets orbiting giants show lower orbital eccentricities than those orbiting subgiants and
dwarfs.
