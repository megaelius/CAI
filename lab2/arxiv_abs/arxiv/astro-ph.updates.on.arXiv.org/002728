The neutral atomic Hydrogen (H I) kinematics of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is revisited in
light of two new proper motion estimates. We analysed the intensity weighted H I velocity maps of
the ATCA/Parkes and GASS data sets. We corrected the line of sight velocity field for the systemic,
transverse, precession, and nutation motions of the disk using two recent proper motion estimates,
and estimated the kinematic parameters of the H I disk. The value of position angle (PA) of kinematic
major axis estimated using ATCA/Parkes data is found to be similar to the recent estimate of the PA
using stellar tracers. The effect of precession and nutation in the estimation of PA is found to be
significant. Using ATCA/Parkes data, most of the H I gas in the LMC is found to be located in the disk.
We detected 12.1% of the data points as kinematic outliers. We identified the well-known Arm E, Arm
S, Arm W, Arm B and a new stream, Outer Arm, as part of outlier components. The GASS data analysis brings
out the velocity details of the Magellanic Bridge (MB) and its connection to the LMC disk. We find
that the Arm B and the Outer Arm are connected to the MB. We detect high velocity gas in the western disk
of the LMC and the south-west and southern parts of the MB. We proposed two models (in plane and out
of plane) to explain the outlier gas. We suggest that the Arm B could be an infall feature, originating
from the inner MB. The Arm E could be an outflow feature. We suggest possible outflows from the western
LMC disk and south and south western MB, which could be due to ram pressure. The velocity pattern observed
in the MB suggests that it is being sheared. We suggest that the various outliers identified in this
study may be caused by a combination of tidal effects and hydrodynamical effect due to the motion
of the LMC in the Milky Way (MW) halo.
