Context: Few Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) reveal a double sided jet system. However, these are crucial
to understand basic physical properties of extragalactic jets. Aims: We address the questions
whether jets in AGN are symmetric in nature, how well they are collimated on small scales, and how
do they evolve with time. Methods: We monitored the sub-parsec scale morphology of NGC1052 with
the VLBA at 43GHz from 2005 to 2009. Results: A detailed study of 29 epochs show an asymmetry between
both jets. A kinematic analysis of the outflows reveals higher apparent velocities for the eastern
jet as compared to the western one: beta_ej = 0.529+-0.038 and beta_wj = 0.343+-0.037, respectively.
Contradictory to previous studies, we find higher flux densities for the western jet. The distribution
of brightness temperature and jet width features well collimated jets up to 1mas distance to the
dynamic center and a nearly conical outflow further outwards. Combining flux density ratios and
velocities of the jet flow, we were not able to find a combination of intrinsic velocity and inclination
angle of the jets that is consistent for all observations, which is contradictory to symmetrically
evolving jets. Spectral index maps between quasi-simultaneous 22GHz and 43GHz observations support
the existence of an optically thick absorber covering the innermost 1.6 mas around the 43GHz central
feature and an optically thin jet emission with a spectral index of <= -1. Conclusions: Our results
fit into a picture in which we expect larger internal energy and/or magnetic flux in the western jet
and higher kinetic energy in the eastern jet. Previous observations at lower frequencies found
slower velocities of the moving jet features as compared to this work. Considering the different
velocities at different areas we suggest a spine-sheath structure with a faster inner layer and
a slower outer layer.
