Stripped-envelope (SE) supernovae (SNe) include H-poor (Type IIb), H-free (Type Ib) and He-free
(Type Ic) events thought to be associated with the deaths of massive stars. The exact nature of their
progenitors is a matter of debate. Here we present the analysis of the light curves of 34 SE SNe published
by the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP-I), which are unparalleled in terms of photometric accuracy
and wavelength range. Light-curve parameters are estimated through the fits of an analytical function
and trends are searched for among the resulting fit parameters. We found a tentative correlation
between the peak absolute $B$-band magnitude and $\Delta m_{15}(B)$, as well as a correlation between
the late-time linear slope and $\Delta m_{15}$. Making use of the full set of optical and near-IR
photometry, combined with robust host-galaxy extinction corrections, bolometric light curves
are constructed and compared to both analytic and hydrodynamical models. From the hydrodynamical
models we obtained ejecta masses of $1.1-6.2$ $M_{\odot}$, $^{56}$Ni masses of $0.03-0.35$ $M_{\odot}$,
and explosion energies (excluding two SNe Ic-BL) of $0.25-3.0\times10^{51}$ erg. Our analysis
indicates that adopting $\kappa = 0.07$ cm$^{2}$ g$^{-1}$ as the mean opacity serves to be a suitable
assumption when comparing Arnett-model results to those obtained from hydrodynamical calculations.
We also find that adopting He I and O I line velocities to infer the expansion velocity in He-rich and
He-poor SNe, respectively, provides ejecta masses relatively similar to those obtained by using
the Fe II line velocities. The inferred ejecta masses are compatible with intermediate mass ($M_{ZAMS}
\leq 20$ $M_{\odot}$) progenitor stars in binary systems for the majority of SE SNe. Furthermore,
the majority of our SNe is affected by significant mixing of $^{56}$Ni, particularly in the case
of SNe Ic.
