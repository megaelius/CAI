Binary systems containing a massive star and a non-accreting pulsar present strong interaction
between the stellar and the pulsar winds. The properties of this interaction, which largely determine
the non-thermal radiation in these systems, strongly depend on the structure of the stellar wind,
which can be clumpy or strongly anisotropic, as in Be stars. We study numerically the influence of
inhomogeneities in the stellar wind on the structure of the two-wind interaction region. We carried
out for the first time axisymmetric, relativistic hydrodynamical simulations, with Lorentz factors
of ~6 and accounting for the impact of instabilities, to study the impact in the two-wind interaction
structure of an over-dense region of the stellar wind. We also followed the evolution of this over-dense
region or clump as it faces the impact of the pulsar wind. For typical system parameters, and adopting
a stellar wind inhomogeneity with a density contrast >~10, clumps with radii of a few percent
of the binary size can significantly perturb the two-wind interaction region, pushing the two-wind
interface to <~40% of the initial distance to the pulsar. After it is shocked, the inhomogeneity
quickly expands and is disrupted when it reaches the smallest distance to the pulsar. It eventually
fragments, being advected away from the binary system. The whole interaction region is quite unstable,
and the shocked pulsar wind can strongly change under small perturbations. We confirm the sensitive
nature of the two-wind interaction structure to perturbations, in particular when the stellar
wind is inhomogeneous. For realistic over-dense regions of the stellar wind, the interaction region
may shrink by a factor of a few, with the shocked flow presenting a complex spatial and temporal pattern.
This can lead to strong variations in the non-thermal radiation.
