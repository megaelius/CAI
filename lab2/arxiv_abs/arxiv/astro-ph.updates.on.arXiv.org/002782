Cosmological galaxy formation simulations can now produce rich and diverse ensembles of galaxy
histories. These simulated galaxy histories, taken all together, provide an answer to the question
"how do galaxies form?" for the models used to construct them. We characterize such galaxy history
ensembles both to understand their properties and to identify points of comparison for histories
within a given galaxy formation model or between different galaxy formation models and simulations.
We focus primarily on stellar mass histories of galaxies with the same final stellar mass, for six
final stellar mass values and for three different simulated galaxy formation models (a semi-analytic
model built upon the dark matter Millennium simulation and two models from the hydrodynamical OverWhelmingly
Large Simulations project). Using principal component analysis (PCA) to classify scatter around
the average stellar mass history, we find that one fluctuation dominates for all sets of histories
we consider, although its shape and contribution can vary between samples. We correlate the PCA
characterization with several $z=0$ galaxy properties (to connect with survey observables) and
also compare it to some other galaxy history properties. We then explore separating galaxy stellar
mass histories into classes, using the largest PCA contribution, k-means clustering, and simple
Gaussian mixture models. For three component models, these different methods often gave similar
results. These history classification methods provide a succinct and often quick way to characterize
changes in the full ensemble of histories of a simulated population as physical assumptions are
varied, to compare histories of different simulated populations to each other, and to assess the
relation of simulated histories to fixed time observations.
