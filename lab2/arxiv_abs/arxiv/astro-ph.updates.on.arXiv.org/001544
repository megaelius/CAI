We report the detection of interstellar silicate dust in the z_abs=0.685 absorber along the sightline
toward the gravitationally lensed blazar TXS 0218+357. Using Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared
Spectrograph data we detect the 10 micron silicate absorption feature with a detection significance
of 10.7-sigma. We fit laboratory-derived silicate dust profile templates obtained from literature
to the observed 10 micron absorption feature, and find that the best single-mineral fit is obtained
using an amorphous olivine template with a measured peak optical depth of tau_10=0.49+/-0.02,
which rises to tau_10~0.67+/-0.04 if the covering factor is taken into account. We also detected
the 18 micron silicate absorption feature in our data with a >3-sigma significance. Due to the
proximity of the 18 micron absorption feature to the edge of our covered spectral range, and associated
uncertainty about the shape of the quasar continuum normalization near 18 micron, we do not independently
fit this feature. We find, however, that the shape and depth of the 18 micron silicate absorption
are well-matched to the amorphous olivine template prediction, given the optical depth inferred
for the 10 micron feature. The measured 10 micron peak optical depth in this absorber is significantly
higher than those found in previously studied quasar absorption systems. The reddening, 21-cm
absorption, and velocity spread of Mg II are not outliers relative to other studied absorption systems,
however. This high optical depth may be evidence for variations in dust grain properties in the ISM
between this and the previously studied high redshift galaxies.
