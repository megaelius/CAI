We present cosmological results from a combined analysis of galaxy clustering and weak gravitational
lensing, using 1321 deg$^2$ of $griz$ imaging data from the first year of the Dark Energy Survey (DES
Y1). We combine three two-point functions: (i) the cosmic shear correlation function of 26 million
source galaxies in four redshift bins, (ii) the galaxy angular autocorrelation function of 650,000
luminous red galaxies in five redshift bins, and (iii) the galaxy-shear cross-correlation of luminous
red galaxy positions and source galaxy shears. To demonstrate the robustness of these results,
we use independent pairs of galaxy shape, photometric redshift estimation and validation, and
likelihood analysis pipelines. To prevent confirmation bias, the bulk of the analysis was carried
out while blind to the true results; we describe an extensive suite of systematics checks performed
and passed during this blinded phase. The data are modeled in flat $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM cosmologies,
marginalizing over 20 nuisance parameters, varying 6 (for $\Lambda$CDM) or 7 (for $w$CDM) cosmological
parameters including the neutrino mass density and including the 457 $\times$ 457 element analytic
covariance matrix. We find consistent cosmological results from these three two-point functions,
and from their combination obtain $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 (\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.783^{+0.021}_{-0.025}$
and $\Omega_m = 0.264^{+0.032}_{-0.019}$ for $\Lambda$CDM for $w$CDM, we find $S_8 = 0.794^{+0.029}_{-0.027}$,
$\Omega_m = 0.279^{+0.043}_{-0.022}$, and $w=-0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.22}$ at 68% CL. The precision
of these DES Y1 results rivals that from the Planck cosmic microwave background measurements, allowing
a comparison of structure in the very early and late Universe on equal terms. Although the DES Y1 best-fit
values for $S_8$ and $\Omega_m$ are lower than the central values from Planck ...
