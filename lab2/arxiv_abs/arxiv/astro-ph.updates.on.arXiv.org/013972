Aims. The orbital structure of galaxies is strongly influenced by the accuracy of the force calculation
during orbit integration. We explore the accuracy of force calculations for two expansion methods
and determine which one is preferable for orbit integration. Methods. We specifically compare
two methods, one introduced by Hernquist \& Ostriker (HO) (which uses a spherical coordinate system
and was built specifically for the Hernquist model), and the other by Vasiliev \& Athanassoula (CylSP)
with a cylindrical coordinate system. Our comparisons include the Dehnen profile, its triaxial
extension (of which the Hernquist profile is a special case) and a multi-component system including
a bar and disc density distributions for both analytical models and $N$-body realizations. Results.
For the generalized Dehnen density, the CylSP method is more accurate than the HO method for nearly
all inner power-law indices and shapes and at all radii. For $N$-body realizations of the Dehnen
model, or snapshots of an $N$-body simulation, the CylSP method is more accurate than the HO method
in the central region for the oblate and prolate Hernquist profile if the particle number is more
than $5\times 10^5$. For snapshots of the Hernquist models with spherical and triaxial shapes,
the HO method is preferred. For the Ferrers bar model, the force from the CylSP method is more accurate
than the HO method. The required CPU time for the HO method is significantly larger than that for the
CylSP method in analytical models, but this is reversed if the input is particle positions from an
$N$-body simulation. From surface of section analyses, we find that the HO method creates more chaotic
orbits than the CylSP method in the bar model. This could be understood as due to a spurious peak in
the central region when the force is calculated with the HO expansion. (Abridged)
