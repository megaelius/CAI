We present results from a survey of 70 radio galaxies (RGs) at redshifts 1<z<5.2 using the
PACS and SPIRE on-board Herschel. Combined with existing mid-IR photometry from Spitzer and observations
obtained with LABOCA, the SEDs of galaxies in our sample are continuously covered across 3.6-870um.
The total infrared luminosities of these RGs are such that they almost all are either ultra-or hyper-luminous
infrared galaxies. We fit the infrared SEDs with a set of empirical templates which represent dust
heated (1) by a variety of SB and (2) by a AGN. We find that the SEDs of RGs require the dust to be heated
by both AGN and SB, but the luminosities of these two components are not strongly correlated. Assuming
empirical relations and simple physical assumptions, we calculate the SFR, the black hole mass
accretion rate (MdotBH), and the black hole mass (MBH) for each RG. We find that the host galaxies
and their BHs are growing extremely rapidly, having SFR~100-5000 Msun/yr and MdotBH~1-100 Msun/yr.
The mean sSFR of RGs at z>2.5 are higher than the sSFR of typical star-forming galaxies over the
same redshift range but are similar or perhaps lower than the galaxy population for RGs at z<2.5.
By comparing the sSFR and the specific black hole mass accretion rate, we conclude that BHs in radio
loud AGN are already, or soon will be, overly massive compared to their host galaxies in terms of expectations
from the local MBH-MGal relation. In order to ``catch up'' with the BH, the galaxies require about
an order-of magnitude more time to grow in mass, at the observed SFRs, compared to the time the BH is
actively accreting. However, during the current cycle of activity, we argue that this catching-up
is likely to be difficult due to the short gas depletion times. Finally, we speculate on how the host
galaxies might grow sufficiently in stellar mass to ultimately fall onto the local MBH-MGal relation.
