The alignment between satellites and central galaxies has been studied in detail both in observational
and theoretical works. The widely accepted fact is that the satellites preferentially reside along
the major axis of their central galaxy. However, the origin and large-scale environment dependence
of this alignment are still unknown. In an attempt to figure out those, we use data constructed from
SDSS DR7 to investigate the large-scale environmental dependence of this alignment with emphasis
on examining the alignments' dependence on the colour of the central galaxy. We find a very strong
large-scale environmental dependence of the satellite-central alignment in groups with blue
centrals. Satellites of blue centrals in knots are preferentially located perpendicular to the
major axis of the centrals, and the alignment angle decreases with environment namely when going
from knots to voids. The alignment angle strongly depend on the ${}^{0.1}(g-r)$ colour of centrals.
We suggest that the satellite-central alignment is the result of a competition between satellite
accretion within large scale-structure and galaxy evolution inside host haloes. For groups containing
red central galaxies, the satellite-central alignment is mainly determined by the evolution effect,
while for blue central dominated groups, the effect of large-scale structure plays a more important
role, especially in knots. Our results provide an explanation for how the satellite-central alignment
forms within different large-scale environments. The perpendicular case in groups and knots with
blue centrals may also provide insight into understanding similar polar arrangements such the
formation of the Milky Way and Centaurus A's satellite system.
