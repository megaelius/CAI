We extend the {\sl\,PARSEC} library of stellar evolutionary tracks by computing new models of massive
stars, from 14\Msun to 350\Msun. The input physics is the same used in the {\sl\,PARSEC}~V1.1 version,
but for the mass-loss rate which is included by considering the most recent updates in literature.
We focus on low metallicity, $Z$=0.001 and $Z$=0.004, for which the metal poor dwarf irregular star
forming galaxies, Sextans A, WLM and NCG6822, provide simple but powerful workbenches. The models
reproduce fairly well the observed CMDs but the stellar colour distributions indicate that the
predicted blue loop is not hot enough in models with canonical extent of overshooting. In the framework
of a mild extended mixing during central hydrogen burning, the only way to reconcile the discrepancy
is to enhance the overshooting at the base of the convective envelope (EO) during the first dredge-UP.
The mixing scales required to reproduce the observed loops, EO=2\HP or EO=4\HP, are definitely
larger than those derived from, e.g., the observed location of the RGB bump in low mass stars. This
effect, if confirmed, would imply a strong dependence of the mixing scale below the formal Schwarzschild
border, on the stellar mass or luminosity. Reproducing the features of the observed CMDs with standard
values of envelope overshooting would require a metallicity significantly lower than the values
measured in these galaxies. Other quantities, such as the star formation rate and the initial mass
function, are only slightly sensitive to this effect. Future investigations will consider other
metallicities and different mixing schemes.
