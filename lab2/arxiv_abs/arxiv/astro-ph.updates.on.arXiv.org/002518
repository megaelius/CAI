Massive stars likely played an important role in the reionization of the Universe, and the formation
of the first black holes. Massive stars in low-metallicity environments in the local Universe are
reminiscent of their high redshift counterparts. In a previous paper, we reported on indications
that the stellar winds of low-metallicity O stars may be stronger than predicted, which would challenge
the current paradigm of massive star evolution. In this paper, we aim to extend our initial sample
of six O stars in low-metallicity environments by four. We aim to derive their stellar and wind parameters,
and compare these to radiation-driven wind theory and stellar evolution models. We have obtained
intermediate-resolution VLT/X-Shooter spectra of our sample of stars. We derive the stellar parameters
by fitting synthetic fastwind line profiles to the VLT/X-Shooter spectra using a genetic fitting
algoritm. We compare our parameters to evolutionary tracks and obtain evolutionary masses and
ages. We also investigate the effective temperature versus spectral type calibration for SMC and
lower metallicities. Finally, we reassess the wind momentum versus luminosity diagram. The derived
parameters of our target stars indicate stellar masses that reach values of up to 50 $M_{\odot}$.
The wind strengths of our stars are, on average, stronger than predicted from radiation-driven
wind theory and reminiscent of stars with an LMC metallicity. We discuss indications that the iron
content of the host galaxies is higher than originally thought and is instead SMC-like. We find that
the discrepancy with theory is lessened, but remains significant for this higher metallicity.
This may imply that our current understanding of the wind properties of massive stars, both in the
local universe as well as at cosmic distances, remains incomplete.
