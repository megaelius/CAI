We derive robust constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) using the clustering of 800,000
photometric quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in the redshift range $0.5<z<3.5$.
These measurements rely on the novel technique of extended mode projection to control the impact
of spatially-varying systematics in a robust fashion, making use of blind analysis techniques.
This allows the accurate measurement of quasar halo bias at the largest scales, while discarding
as little as possible of the data. The standard local-type PNG parameters $f_\mathrm{NL}$ and $g_\mathrm{NL}$
both imprint a $k^{-2}$ scale-dependent effect in the bias. Constraining these individually,
we obtain $-49<f_\mathrm{NL}<31$ and $-2.7\times10^5<g_\mathrm{NL}<1.9\times10^5$,
while their joint constraints lead to $-105<f_\mathrm{NL}<72$ and $-4.0\times10^5<g_\mathrm{NL}<4.9\times10^5$
(all at 95% CL) . Introducing a running parameter $n_{f_\mathrm{NL}}$ to constrain $b(k) \propto
k^{-2+n_{f_\mathrm{NL}}}$ and a generalised PNG amplitude $\tilde{f}_\mathrm{NL}$, we obtain
$-45.5 \exp({3.7\, n_{f_\mathrm{NL}}}) < \tilde{f}_\mathrm{NL} < 34.4 \exp({3.3\, n_{f_\mathrm{NL}}})$
at 95% CL. These results incorporate uncertainties in the cosmological parameters, redshift distributions,
shot noise, and the bias prescription used to relate the quasar clustering to the underlying dark
matter. These are the strongest constraints obtained to date on PNG using a single population of
large-scale structure tracers, and are already at the level of pre-Planck constraints from the
cosmic microwave background. They demonstrate the importance of robustly mitigating systematics
in order to exploit upcoming large scale structure surveys to probe the initial conditions of the
universe.
