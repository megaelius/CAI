The composition and properties of interstellar silicate dust are not well understood. In X-rays,
interstellar dust can be studied in detail by making use of the fine structure features in the Si K-edge.
The features in the Si K-edge offer a range of possibilities to study silicon-bearing dust, such
as investigating the crystallinity, abundance, and the chemical composition along a given line
of sight. We present newly acquired laboratory measurements of the silicon K-edge of several silicate-compounds
that complement our measurements from our earlier pilot study. The resulting dust extinction profiles
serve as templates for the interstellar extinction that we observe. The extinction profiles were
used to model the interstellar dust in the dense environments of the Galaxy. The laboratory measurements,
taken at the Soleil synchrotron facility in Paris, were adapted for astrophysical data analysis
and implemented in the SPEX spectral fitting program. The models were used to fit the spectra of nine
low-mass X-ray binaries located in the Galactic center neighborhood in order to determine the dust
properties along those lines of sight. Most lines of sight can be fit well by amorphous olivine. We
also established upper limits on the amount of crystalline material that the modeling allows. We
obtained values of the total silicon abundance, silicon dust abundance, and depletion along each
of the sightlines. We find a possible gradient of $0.06\pm0.02$ dex/kpc for the total silicon abundance
versus the Galactocentric distance. We do not find a relation between the depletion and the extinction
along the line of sight.
