We investigate the formation times of eruptive magnetic flux ropes relative to the onset of solar
eruptions, which is important for constraining models of coronal mass ejection (CME) initiation.
We inspected uninterrupted sequences of 131 \AA\ images that spanned more than eight hours and were
obtained by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
to identify the formation times of hot flux ropes that erupted in CMEs from locations close to the
limb. The appearance of the flux ropes as well as their evolution toward eruptions were determined
using morphological criteria. Two-thirds (20/30) of the flux ropes were formed well before the
onset of the eruption (from 51 minutes to more than eight hours), and their formation was associated
with the occurrence of a confined flare. We also found four events with preexisting hot flux ropes
whose formations occurred a matter of minutes (from three to 39) prior to the eruptions without any
association with distinct confined flare activity. Six flux ropes were formed once the eruptions
were underway. However, in three of them, prominence material could be seen in 131 \AA\ images, which
may indicate the presence of preexisting flux ropes that were not hot. The formation patterns of
the last three groups of hot flux ropes did not show significant differences. For the whole population
of events, the mean and median values of the time difference between the onset of the eruptive flare
and the appearance of the hot flux rope were 151 and 98 minutes, respectively. Our results provide,
on average, indirect support for CME models that involve preexisting flux ropes; on the other hand,
for a third of the events, models in which the ejected flux rope is formed during the eruption appear
more appropriate.
