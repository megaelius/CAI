Massive Ultracompact Galaxies (MUGs) are common at z=2-3, but very rare in the nearby Universe.
Simulations predict that the few surviving MUGs should reside in galaxy clusters, whose large relative
velocities prevent them from merging, thus maintaining their original properties (namely stellar
populations, masses, sizes and dynamical state). We take advantage of the high-completeness,
large-area spectroscopic GAMA survey, complementing it with deeper imaging from the KiDS and VIKING
surveys. We find a set of 22 bona-fide MUGs, defined as having high stellar mass (>8x10^10 M_Sun)
and compact size (R_e<2 Kpc) at 0.02 < z < 0.3. An additional set of 7 lower-mass objects (6x10^10 <
M_star/M_Sun < 8x10^10) are also potential candidates according to typical mass uncertainties.
The comoving number density of MUGs at low redshift (z < 0.3) is constrained at $(1.2\pm 0.4)x 10^-6
Mpc^-3, consistent with galaxy evolution models. However, we find a mixed distribution of old and
young galaxies, with a quarter of the sample representing (old) relics. MUGs have a predominantly
early/swollen disk morphology (Sersic index 1<n<2.5) with high stellar surface densities (<Sigma_e>
~ 10^10 M_Sun Kpc^-2). Interestingly, a large fraction feature close companions -- at least in projection
-- suggesting that many (but not all) live in the central regions of groups. Halo masses show these
galaxies inhabit average-mass groups. As MUGs are found to be almost equally distributed among
environments of different masses, their relative fraction is higher in more massive overdensities,
matching the expectations that some of these galaxies fell in these regions at early times. However,
there must be another channel leading some of these galaxies to an abnormally low merger history
because our sample shows a number of objects that do not inhabit particularly dense environments.
