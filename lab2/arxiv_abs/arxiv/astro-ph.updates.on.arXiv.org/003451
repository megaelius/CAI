We present a large suite of simulations of the formation of low-mass star clusters. Our simulations
include an extensive set of physical processes -- magnetohydrodynamics, radiative transfer,
and protostellar outflows -- and span a wide range of virial parameters and magnetic field strengths.
Comparing the outcomes of our simulations to observations, we find that simulations remaining
close to virial balance throughout their history produce star formation efficiencies and initial
mass function (IMF) peaks that are stable in time and in reasonable agreement with observations.
Our results indicate that small-scale dissipation effects near the protostellar surface provide
a feedback loop for stabilizing the star formation efficiency. This is true regardless of whether
the balance is maintained by input of energy from large scale forcing or by strong magnetic fields
that inhibit collapse. In contrast, simulations that leave virial balance and undergo runaway
collapse form stars too efficiently and produce an IMF that becomes increasingly top-heavy with
time. In all cases we find that the competition between magnetic flux advection toward the protostar
and outward advection due to magnetic interchange instabilities, and the competition between
turbulent amplification and reconnection close to newly-formed protostars renders the local
magnetic field structure insensitive to the strength of the large-scale field, ensuring that radiation
is always more important than magnetic support in setting the fragmentation scale and thus the IMF
peak mass. The statistics of multiple stellar systems are similarly insensitive to variations
in the initial conditions and generally agree with observations within the range of statistical
uncertainty.
