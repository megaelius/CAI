Substantial evidence in the last few decades suggests that outflows from supermassive black holes
(SMBH) may play a significant role in the evolution of galaxies. Large-scale outflows known as warm
absorbers (WA) and fast disk winds known as ultra-fast outflows (UFO) are commonly found in the spectra
of many Seyfert galaxies and quasars and a correlation has been suggested between them. Recent detections
of low ionization and low column density outflows, but with a high velocity comparable to UFOs, challenge
such initial possible correlations. Observations of UFOs in AGN indicate that their energetics
may be enough to impact the interstellar medium (ISM). However, observational evidence of the interaction
between the inner high-ionization outflow and the ISM is still missing. We present here the spectral
analysis of 12 XMM-Newton/EPIC archival observations of the quasar PG 1114+445, aimed at studying
the complex outflowing nature of its absorbers. Our analysis revealed the presence of three absorbing
structures. We find a WA with velocity $v\sim530$ km s$^{-1}$, ionization $\log\xi/\text{erg
cm s}^{-1}\sim0.35$ and column density $\log N_\text{H}/\text{cm}^{-2}\sim22$, and a UFO with
$v_\text{out}\sim0.145c$, $\log\xi/\text{erg cm s}^{-1}\sim4$, and $\log N_\text{H}/\text{cm}^{-2}\sim23$.
We also find an additional absorber in the soft X-rays ($E<2$ keV) with velocity comparable to the
one of the UFO ($v_\text{out}\sim0.120c$), but ionization ($\log\xi/\text{erg cm s}^{-1}\sim0.5$)
and column density ($\log N_\text{H}/\text{cm}^{-2}\sim21.5$) comparable with the ones of the
WA. The ionization, velocity and variability of the three absorbers indicate an origin in a multiphase
and multiscale outflow, consistently with entrainment of the clumpy ISM by an inner UFO moving at
$\sim15\%$ the speed of light, producing an entrained ultra-fast outflow (E-UFO).
