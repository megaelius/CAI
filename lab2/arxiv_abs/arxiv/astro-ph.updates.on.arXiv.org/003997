We report results of the first comprehensive, high resolution study of the deflections of UHECRs
using a realistic model of the Galactic magnetic field and extending to sufficiently low rigidities,
R = E/Z = 10^18 V, to describe Fe in the UHE energy range or the mixed composition reported by the Pierre
Auger Collaboration at the energy of the observed dipole anisotropy. We use the Jansson-Farrar
(JF12) model, which has both large scale coherent and a structured random components, and determine
deflections for fifteen rigidities from 10^18.0 to 10^20.0 V, for L_coh = 30 pc and 100 pc. We check
the sensitivity of UHECR deflections to the particular realization of the random field, for 3 rigidity
values. For each rigidity and field model studied, the UHECR arrival direction distribution is
determined for an arbitrary source direction, by inverting the trajectories of > 5 x 10^7 isotropic
anti-CRs of the given rigidity. We present skyplots and tables characterizing the arrival directions,
for representative 1 deg sources. Except at high rigidity, the pattern of multiple images is very
complex and depends strongly on the coherence length and source direction. For almost all sources,
average deflections grow rapidly as the rigidity falls below 10 EV and deflections commonly are
greater than 90 deg. Magnification and demagnification can be strong at almost all rigidities,
and varies significantly with source direction. Much of the extragalactic celestial sphere, behind
and south of the Galactic Center, cannot be seen in UHECRs below 10 EV. The pattern of deflections
obtained with the coherent field alone can be significantly different than with the complete field
model, even as regards the position of the centroid, for some source directions and rigidities.
Multiple images, sometimes very widely separated, are common for small coherence length, especially
for low rigidity.
