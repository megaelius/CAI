An idealized "test" object in general relativity moves along a geodesic. However, if the object
has a finite mass, this will create additional curvature in the spacetime, causing it to deviate
from geodesic motion. If the mass is nonetheless sufficiently small, such an effect is usually treated
perturbatively and is known as the gravitational self-force due to the object. This issue is still
an open problem in gravitational physics today, motivated not only by basic foundational interest,
but also by the need for its direct application in gravitational-wave astronomy. In particular,
the observation of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals by the future space-based detector LISA will
rely crucially on an accurate modeling of the self-force driving the orbital evolution and gravitational
wave emission of such systems. In this paper, we present a novel derivation, based on conservation
laws, of the basic equations of motion for this problem. They are formulated with the use of a quasilocal
(rather than matter) stress-energy-momentum tensor---in particular, the Brown-York tensor---so
as to capture gravitational effects in the momentum flux of the object, including the self-force.
Our formulation and resulting equations of motion are independent of the choice of the perturbative
gauge. We show that, in addition to the usual gravitational self-force term, they also lead to an
additional "self-pressure" force not found in previous analyses, and also that our results correctly
recover known formulas under appropriate conditions. Our approach thus offers a fresh geometrical
picture from which to understand the self-force fundamentally, and potentially useful new avenues
for computing it practically.
