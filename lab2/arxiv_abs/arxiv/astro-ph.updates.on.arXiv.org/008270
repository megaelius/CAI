Aims. We use four observational data sets, mainly from the Rosetta mission, to constrain the activity
pattern of the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Methods. We develop a numerical model
that computes the production rate and non-gravitational acceleration of the nucleus of comet 67P
as a function of time, taking into account its complex shape with a shape model reconstructed from
OSIRIS imagery. We use this model to fit three observational data sets: the trajectory data from
flight dynamics; the rotation state, as reconstructed from OSIRIS imagery; and the water production
measurements from ROSINA, of 67P. The two key parameters of our model, adjusted to fit the three data
sets all together, are the activity pattern and the momentum transfer efficiency (i.e., the so-called
"$\eta$ parameter" of the non-gravitational forces). Results. We find an activity pattern able
to successfully reproduce the three data sets simultaneously. The fitted activity pattern exhibits
two main features: a higher effective active fraction in two southern super-regions ($\sim 10$~\%)
outside perihelion compared to the northern ones ($< 4$~\%), and a drastic rise of the effective
active fraction of the southern regions ($\sim 25-35$~\%) around perihelion. We interpret the
time-varying southern effective active fraction by cyclic formation and removal of a dust mantle
in these regions. Our analysis supports moderate values of the momentum transfer coefficient $\eta$
in the range $0.6-0.7$; values $\eta\leq0.5$ or $\eta\geq0.8$ degrade significantly the fit to
the three data sets. Our conclusions reinforce the idea that seasonal effects linked to the orientation
of the spin axis play a key role in the formation and evolution of dust mantles, and in turn largely
control the temporal variations of the gas flux.
