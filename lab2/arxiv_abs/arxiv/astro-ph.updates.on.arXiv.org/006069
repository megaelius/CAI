Spectroscopy across spatially resolved stellar surfaces reveals spectral line profiles free
from rotational broadening, whose gradual changes from disk center toward the stellar limb reflect
an atmospheric fine structure that is possible to model by 3-D hydrodynamics. Previous studies
of photospheric spectral lines across stellar disks exist for the Sun and HD209458 (G0 V) and are
now extended to the planet-hosting HD189733A to sample a cooler K-type star and explore the future
potential of the method. During exoplanet transit, stellar surface portions successively become
hidden and differential spectroscopy between various transit phases uncovers spectra of small
surface segments temporarily hidden behind the planet. In Paper I, observable signatures were
predicted quantitatively from hydrodynamic simulations. From observations of HD189733A with
the ESO HARPS spectrometer at R=115,000, profiles for stronger and weaker Fe I lines are retrieved
at several center-to-limb positions, reaching adequate S/N after averaging over numerous similar
lines. Retrieved line profile widths and depths are compared to synthetic ones from models with
parameters bracketing those of the target star and are found to be consistent with 3-D simulations.
Center-to-limb changes strongly depend on the surface granulation structure and much greater
line-width variation is predicted in hotter F-type stars with vigorous granulation than in cooler
K-types. Such parameters, obtained from fits to full line profiles, are realistic to retrieve for
brighter planet-hosting stars, while their hydrodynamic modeling offers previously unexplored
diagnostics for stellar atmospheric fine structure and 3-D line formation. Precise modeling may
be required in searches for Earth-analog exoplanets around K-type stars, whose more tranquil surface
granulation and lower ensuing microvariability may enable such detections.
