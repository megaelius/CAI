The Planck High Frequency Instrument (HFI) surveyed the sky continuously from August 2009 to January
2012. Its noise and sensitivity performance were excellent, but the rate of cosmic ray impacts on
the HFI detectors was unexpectedly high. Furthermore, collisions of cosmic rays with the focal
plane produced transient signals in the data (glitches) with a wide range of characteristics. A
study of cosmic ray impacts on the HFI detector modules has been undertaken to categorize and characterize
the glitches, to correct the HFI time-ordered data, and understand the residual effects on Planck
maps and data products. This paper presents an evaluation of the physical origins of glitches observed
by the HFI detectors. In order to better understand the glitches observed by HFI in flight, several
ground-based experiments were conducted with flight-spare HFI bolometer modules. The experiments
were conducted between 2010 and 2013 with HFI test bolometers in different configurations using
varying particles and impact energies. The bolometer modules were exposed to 23 MeV protons from
the Orsay IPN TANDEM accelerator, and to $^{241}$Am and $^{244}$Cm $\alpha$-particle and $^{55}$Fe
radioactive X-ray sources. The calibration data from the HFI ground-based preflight tests were
used to further characterize the glitches and compare glitch rates with statistical expectations
under laboratory conditions. Test results provide strong evidence that the dominant family of
glitches observed in flight are due to cosmic ray absorption by the silicon die substrate on which
the HFI detectors reside. Glitch energy is propagated to the thermistor by ballistic phonons, while
there is also a thermal diffusion contribution. The implications of these results for future satellite
missions, especially those in the far-infrared to sub-millimetre and millimetre regions of the
electromagnetic spectrum, are discussed.
