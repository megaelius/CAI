A planetary atmosphere is the outer gas layer of a planet. Besides its scientific significance among
the first and most accessible planetary layers observed from space, it is closely connected with
planetary formation and evolution, surface and interior processes, and habitability of planets.
Current theories of the planetary atmosphere were primarily obtained through the studies of eight
large planets, Pluto and three large moons (Io, Titan, and Triton) in the Solar System. Outside the
Solar System, more than four thousand extra-solar planets (exoplanets) and two thousand brown
dwarfs have been confirmed in our galaxy, and their population is rapidly growing. The rich information
from these exotic bodies offers a database to test, in a statistical sense, the fundamental theories
of planetary climates. Here we review the current knowledge of atmospheres of exoplanets and brown
dwarfs from recent observations and theories. This review highlights important regimes and statistical
trends in an ensemble of atmospheres as an initial step towards fully characterizing diverse substellar
atmospheres, that illustrates the underlying principles and critical problems. Insights are
obtained through analysis of the dependence of atmospheric characteristics on basic planetary
parameters. Dominant processes that influence atmospheric stability, energy transport, temperature,
composition, and flow pattern are discussed and elaborated with simple scaling laws. We dedicate
this review to Dr. Adam P. Showman (1968-2020) in recognition of his fundamental contribution to
the understanding of atmospheric dynamics on giant planets, exoplanets, and brown dwarfs.
