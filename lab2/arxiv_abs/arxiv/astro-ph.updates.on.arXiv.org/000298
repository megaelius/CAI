Planck CMB temperature maps allow us to detect departures from homogeneity and isotropy on the largest
scales. We search for topology with a fundamental domain (nearly) intersecting the last scattering
surface (comoving distance X_r). For most topologies studied the likelihood maximized over the
orientation relative to the observed map shows some preference for multi-connected models just
larger than X_r. Since this effect is also present in simulated realizations of isotropic maps,
we interpret it as the inevitable alignment of mild anisotropic correlations with chance features
in a single sky realization; such a feature can also be present, in milder form, when the likelihood
is marginalized over orientations. Thus marginalized, the limits on the radius R_i of the largest
sphere inscribed in a topological domain (at log-likelihood-ratio -5) are: in a flat Universe,
R_i>0.9X_r for the cubic torus (cf. R_i>0.9X_r at 99% CL for the matched-circles search);
R_i>0.7X_r for the chimney; R_i>0.5X_r for the slab; in a positively curved Universe, R_i>1.0X_r
for the dodecahedron; R_i>1.0X_r for the truncated cube; and R_i>0.9X_r for the octahedron.
We perform a Bayesian search for an anisotropic Bianchi VII_h geometry. In a non-physical setting
where the Bianchi parameters are decoupled from the standard cosmology, Planck data favour a Bianchi
component with a Bayes factor of at least 1.5 units of log-evidence. Indeed, a Bianchi pattern is
quite efficient at accounting for some large-scale anomalies seen in Planck data. However, the
cosmological parameters are in strong disagreement with those found from CMB anisotropy data alone.
In the physically motivated setting where the Bianchi parameters are fitted simultaneously with
the standard cosmological parameters, we find no evidence for a Bianchi VII_h cosmology and constrain
the vorticity of such models at (w/H)_0<8e-10 (95% CL). [Abridged]
