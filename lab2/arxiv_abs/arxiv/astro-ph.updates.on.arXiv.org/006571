We typically measure the radii of transiting exoplanets from the transit depth, which is given by
the ratio of cross-sectional areas of the planet and star. However, if a star has dark starspots (or
bright regions) distributed throughout the transit chord, the transit depth will be biased towards
smaller (larger) values, and thus the inferred planet radius will be smaller (larger) if unaccounted
for. We reparameterize the transit light curve to account for "self-contamination" by photospheric
inhomogeneities by splitting the parameter $R_p/R_\star$ into two parameters: one for the radius
ratio -- which controls the duration of ingress and egress -- and another which measures the possibly
contaminated transit depth. We show that this is equivalent to the formulation for contamination
by a second star (with positive or negative flux), and that it is sensitive to time-steady inhomogeneity
of the stellar photosphere. We use synthetic light curves of spotted stars at high signal-to-noise
to show that the radius recovered from measurement of the ingress/egress duration can recover the
true radii of planets transiting spotted stars with axisymmetric spot distributions if the limb-darkening
parameters are precisely known. We fit time-averaged high signal-to-noise transit light curves
from Kepler and Spitzer of ten planets to measure the planet radii and search for evidence of spot
distributions. We find that this sample has a range of measured depths and ingress durations which
are self-consistent, providing no strong evidence for contamination by spots. However, there
is suggestive evidence for occultation of starspots on Kepler-17, and that relatively bright regions
are occulted by the planets of Kepler-412 and HD 80606. Future observations with the James Webb Space
Telescope may enable this technique to yield accurate planetary radii in the presence of stellar
inhomogeneities.
