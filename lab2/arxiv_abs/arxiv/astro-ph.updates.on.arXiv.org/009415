The morphological evolution of star-forming galaxies provides important clues to understand
their physical properties, as well as the triggering and quenching mechanisms of star formation.
We aim at connecting morphology and star-formation properties of low-mass galaxies (median stellar
mass $\sim$ 10$^{8.5}$ M$_{\odot}$) at low redshift ($z<0.36$). We use a sample of medium-band
selected star-forming galaxies from the GOODS-North field. H$\alpha$ images for the sample are
created combining both spectral energy distribution fits and HST data. Using them, we mask the star
forming regions to obtain an unbiased two-dimensional model of the light distribution of the host
galaxies. For this purpose we use $\texttt{PHI}$, a new Bayesian photometric decomposition code.
We apply it independently to 7 HST bands assuming a S\'ersic surface brightness model. Star-forming
galaxy hosts show low S\'ersic index (with median $n$ $\sim$ 0.9), as well as small sizes (median
$R_e$ $\sim$ 1.6 kpc), and negligible change of the parameters with wavelength (except for the axis
ratio, which grows with wavelength). Using a clustering algorithm, we find two different classes
of star-forming galaxies: A more compact, redder, and high-$n$ (class A) and a more extended, bluer
and lower-$n$ one (class B). We also find evidence that the first class is more spheroidal-like.
In addition, we find that 48% of the analyzed galaxies present negative color gradients (only 5%
are positive). The host component of low-mass star-forming galaxies at $z<0.36$ separates into
two different classes, similar to what has been found for their higher mass counterparts. The results
are consistent with an evolution from class B to class A. Several mechanisms from the literature,
like minor and major mergers, and violent disk instability, can explain the physical process behind
the likely transition between the classes. [abridged]
