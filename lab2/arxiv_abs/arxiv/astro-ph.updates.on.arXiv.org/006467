A suite of 432 collisionless simulations of bound pairs of spiral galaxies with mass ratios 1:1 and
3:1, and global properties consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, is used to test the conjecture
that major mergers fuel the dual AGN of the local volume. Our analysis is based on the premise that
the essential aspects of this scenario can be captured by replacing the physics of the central black
holes with restrictions on their relative separation in phase space. We introduce several estimates
of the dual AGN fraction and infer predictions for the bolometric luminosity thresholds and resolution
limitations typically involved in the detection of these systems, assessing their dependence
on the parameters controlling the length of both mergers and nuclear activity. Given a set of constraints,
we find that the values adopted for the former factors often condition the predictions from individual
experiments. Still, the outcomes do not reveal, in general, obvious relationships, being the tendency
of the frequencies normalized to the merger time to anticorrelate with the orbital circularity
the clearest effect. We also find that the median fractions of observability exhibit a good overall
agreement with the values reported by other theoreticaland observational works, which lends support
to the adopted approach. Seen as a whole, the results of the present study prove that the consideration
of the most common constraints involved in the detection of dual AGN at optical wavelengths is sufficient
to reconcile the intrinsic frequency of $\sim 10\%$ envisaged in a hierarchical universe with the
fractions on the order of $1\%$ of double-peaked narrow-line systems frequently observed at kpc-scales.
One of the most important issues posed by major galaxy collisions as potential inducers of the activity
of dual supermassive black holes has thus been solved.
