Supernova driven winds are often invoked to remove chemically enriched gas from dwarf galaxies
to match their low observed metallicities. In such shallow potential wells, outflows may produce
massive amounts of enriched halo gas (circum-galactic medium or CGM) and pollute the intergalactic
medium (IGM). Here, we present a survey of the CGM and IGM around 18 star-forming field dwarfs with
stellar masses of $\log\,M_*/M_\odot\approx8-9$ at $z\approx0.2$. Eight of these have CGM probed
by quasar absorption spectra at projected distances, $d$, less than the host virial radius, $R_{\rm
h}$. Ten are probed in the surrounding IGM at $d/R_{\rm h}=1-3$. The absorption measurements include
neutral hydrogen, the dominant silicon ions for diffuse cool gas ($T\sim10^4$ K; Si II, Si III, and
Si IV), moderately ionized carbon (C IV), and highly ionized oxygen (O VI). Metal absorption from
the CGM of the dwarfs is less common and $\approx4\times$ weaker compared to massive star-forming
galaxies though O VI absorption is still common. None of the dwarfs probed at $d/R_{\rm h}=1-3$ have
definitive metal-line detections. Combining the available silicon ions, we estimate that the
cool CGM of the dwarfs accounts for only $2-6\%$ of the expected silicon budget from the yields of
supernovae associated with past star-formation. The highly ionized O VI accounts for $\approx8\%$
of the oxygen budget. As O VI traces an ion with expected equilibrium ion fractions of $\lesssim 0.2$,
the highly ionized CGM may represent a significant metal reservoir even for dwarfs not expected
to maintain gravitationally shock heated hot halos.
