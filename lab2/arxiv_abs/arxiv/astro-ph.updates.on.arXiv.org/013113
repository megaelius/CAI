One of the key processes associated with the "standard" flare model is chromospheric evaporation,
a process where plasma heated to high temperatures by energy deposition at the flare footpoints
is driven upwards into the corona. Despite several decades of study, a number of open questions remain,
including the relationship between plasma produced during this process and observations of earlier
"superhot" plasma. Hinode/EIS has a wide slot often used as a flare trigger in the He II emission line
band. Once the intensity passes a threshold level, the study switches to one focussed on the flaring
region. However, when the intensity is not high enough to reach the flare trigger threshold, these
datasets are available during the entire flare period and provide high-cadence spectroscopic
observations over a large field of view. We use one-minute cadence data from two such studies of a
C4.7 flare and a C1.6 flare to probe the relationship between hot Fe XXIV plasma and plasmas observed
by RHESSI and XRT to track where the emission comes from, and when it begins. Although the spatial
and spectral information are merged in the wide-slot data, it is still possible to extract when the
hot plasma appears using the Fe XXIV spectral image. It is also possible to derive spectrally pure
Fe XXIV light curves from the EIS data, and compare them with those derived from hard X-rays, enabling
a full exploration of the evolution of hot emission. The Fe XXIV emission peaks just after the peak
in the hard X-ray lightcurve; consistent with an origin in the evaporation of heated plasma following
the transfer of energy to the lower atmosphere. A peak was also found for the C4.7 flare in the RHESSI
peak temperature, which occurred before the hard X-rays peaked. This suggests that the first peak
in hot-plasma emission is likely directly related to the energy-release process.
