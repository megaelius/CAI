It is widely reported that the power spectra of magnetic field and velocity fluctuations in the solar
wind have power law scalings with inertial-range spectral indices of -5/3 and -3/2 respectively.
Studies of solar wind turbulence have repeatedly demonstrated the impact of discontinuities and
coherent structures on the measured spectral index. Whether or not such discontinuities are self-generated
by the turbulence or simply observations of advected structures from the inner heliosphere has
been a matter of considerable debate. This work presents a statistical study of magnetic field and
velocity spectral indices over 10 years of solar-wind observations; we find that anomalously steep
magnetic spectra occur in magnetically dominated intervals with negative residual energy. However,
this increase in negative residual energy has no noticeable impact on the spectral index of the velocity
fluctuations, suggesting that these intervals with negative residual energy correspond to intermittent
magnetic structures. We show statistically that the difference between magnetic and velocity
spectral indices is a monotonic function of residual energy, consistent with previous work which
suggests that intermittency in fluctuations causes spectral steepening. Additionally, a statistical
analysis of cross helicity demonstrates that when the turbulence is balanced (low cross-helicity),
the magnetic and velocity spectral indices are not equal, which suggests that our observations
of negative residual energy and intermittent structures are related to non-linear turbulent interactions
rather than the presence of advected pre-existing flux-tube structures.
