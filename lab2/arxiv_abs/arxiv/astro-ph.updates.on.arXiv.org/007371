Gravitational waves from inspiraling compact objects provide us with information of the distance
scale since we can infer the absolute luminosity of the source from analysis of the wave form, which
is known as standard sirens. The first detection of the gravitational wave signal of the binary black
hole merger event by Advanced LIGO has opened up the possibility of utilizing standard sirens as
cosmological probe. In order to extract information of the distance-redshift relation, we cross-correlate
weak lensing, which is an unbiased tracer of matter distribution in the Universe, with the projected
number density of gravitational wave sources. For weak lensing, we employ tomography technique
to efficiently obtain information of large-scale structures at wide ranges of redshifts. Making
use of the cross-correlations along with the auto-correlations, we present forecast of constraints
on four cosmological parameters, i.e., Hubble parameter, matter density, the equation of state
parameter of dark energy, and the amplitude of matter fluctuation. To fully explore the ability
of cross-correlations, which require large overlapping sky coverage, we consider the specific
case with the upcoming surveys by \textit{Euclid} for weak lensing and Einstein Telescope for standard
sirens. We show that cosmological parameters can be tightly constrained solely by these auto- and
cross-correlations of standard sirens and weak lensing. For example, the $1\text{-}\sigma$ error
of Hubble parameter is expected to be $\sigma (H_0) = 0.33 \, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$.
Thus, the proposed statistics will be a promising probe into the distance scale.
