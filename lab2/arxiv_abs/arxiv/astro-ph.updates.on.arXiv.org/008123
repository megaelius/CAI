The contribution of active galactic nuclei to the magnetisation of the Universe can be constrained
by knowing their duty cycles, jet and magnetic field morphologies, and the physical processes dominating
their interaction with the surrounding environment. The magnetic field morphology and strength
of radio lobes of AGN has an influence on the mechanisms for the propagation of cosmic rays into intergalactic
space. Using the source B2 0258+35 we want to investigate the interaction of its radio lobes with
the surrounding environment and examine the underlying physical effects. Published HI and radio
continuum data at 21cm were combined with newly reduced archival WSRT polarisation data at the same
wavelength to investigate the polarised emission in the radio lobes of B2 0258+35 where we detected
a unique S-shaped polarised structure. We calculated the pressure to $p=1.95 \pm 0.4 \cdot 10^{-14}$
dyn cm$^{-2}$ using an energy equipartition approach and investigate the physical processes leading
to the detected emission. We observe depolarisation in the northern lobe, which might originate
from the HI-disc in the foreground. In addition we see an anti-correlation between the pressure
and the fractional polarisation along the S-shaped structure. Our results suggest that magnetic
draping can be effectively used to explain the observed polarised structures. This is likely due
to the combination of a relatively low magnetic field strength ($B_{eq}=1.21 \pm 0.12 \mu$G), enabling
super-Alfv\'enic motion of the rising lobes ($M_A=2.47-3.50$), and the coherency of the surrounding
magnetic field. Moreover, the draped layer tends to suppress any mixing of the material between
the radio lobes and the surrounding environment, but can enhance the mixing and re-acceleration
efficiencies inside the lobes, providing an explanation for the average flat spectral index observed
in the lobes.
