In this paper we use observations of molecular tracers in metal rich and alpha-enhanced galaxies
to study the effect of abundance changes on molecular chemistry. We selected a sample of metal rich
spiral and star bursting objects from the literature, and present here new data for a sample of early-type
galaxies (ETGs). We conducted the first survey of CS and methanol emission in ETGs, detecting 7 objects
in CS, and 5 in methanol emission. We find evidence to support the hypothesis that CS is a better tracer
of dense star-forming gas than HCN. We suggest that the methanol emission in these sources is driven
by dust mantle destruction due to ionisation from high mass star formation, but cannot rule out shocks
dominating in some sources. The derived source averaged CS/methanol column densities and rotation
temperatures are similar to those found in normal spiral and starburst galaxies, suggesting dense
clouds are little affected by the differences between galaxy types. Finally we used the total column
density ratios for our galaxy samples to show for the first time that some molecular tracers do seem
to show systematic variations that appear to correlate with metallicity, and that these variations
roughly match those predicted by chemical models. Using this fact, the chemical models of Bayet
et al. (2012b), and assumptions about the optical depth we are able to roughly predict the metallicity
of our spiral and ETG sample, with a scatter of ~0.3 dex. We provide the community with linear approximations
to the relationship between the HCN and CS column density ratio and metallicity. Further study will
clearly be required to determine if this, or any, molecular tracer can be used to robustly determine
gas-phase metallically, but that a relationship exists at all suggests that in the future it may
be possible to calibrate a metallicity indicator for the molecular interstellar medium (abridged).
