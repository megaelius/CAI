We present multi-wavelength observations that trace more than 40 years in the life of the active
galactic nucleus (AGN) in Mrk 590, traditionally known as a classic Seyfert 1 galaxy. From spectra
recently obtained from HST, Chandra, and the Large Binocular Telescope, we find that the activity
in the nucleus of Mrk 590 has diminished so significantly that the continuum luminosity is a factor
of 100 lower than the peak luminosity probed by our long baseline observations. Furthermore, the
broad emission lines, once prominent in the UV/optical spectrum, have all but disappeared. Since
AGN type is defined by the presence of broad emission lines in the optical spectrum, our observations
demonstrate that Mrk 590 has now become a "changing look" AGN. If classified by recent optical spectra,
Mrk 590 would be a Seyfert 1.9, where the only broad emission line still visible in the optical spectrum
is a weak component of Halpha. As an additional consequence of this change, we have made the first
definitive detection of UV narrow-line components in a Type 1 AGN. These observations challenge
the historical paradigm that AGN type is only a consequence of the line of sight viewing angle toward
the nucleus in the presence of a geometrically-flattened, obscuring medium (i.e., the torus).
Our data instead suggest that the current state of Mrk 590 is a consequence of the change in luminosity,
which implies the black hole accretion rate has significantly decreased. The result is that a prominent
broad emission-line region is no longer visible because of the scarcity of photons available to
photoionize the gas in this region.
