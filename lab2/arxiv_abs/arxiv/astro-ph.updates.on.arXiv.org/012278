Numerical simulations of the solar chromosphere predict a diverse thermal structure with both
hot and cool regions. Observations of plage regions, in particular, feature broader and brighter
chromospheric lines, which suggest that they are formed in hotter and denser conditions than in
the quiet-Sun, but also imply a non-thermal component whose source is unclear. We revisit the problem
of the stratification of temperature and microturbulence in plage now adding millimeter continuum
observations provided by ALMA to inversions of near-ultraviolet IRIS spectra as a powerful new
diagnostic to disentangle the two parameters. We fit cool chromospheric holes and track the fast
evolution of compact mm brightnenings in the plage region. We use the STiC non-LTE inversion code
to simultaneously fit real ultraviolet and millimeter spectra in order to infer the thermodynamic
parameters of the plasma. We confirm the anticipated constraining potential of ALMA in non-LTE
inversions of the solar chromosphere. We find significant differences between the inversion results
of IRIS data alone compared to the results of a combination with the mm data: the IRIS+ALMA inversions
have increased contrast and temperature range, and tend to prefer lower values of microturbulence
in the chromosphere of plage. The average brightness temperature of the plage region at 1.25 mm is
8500 K, but the ALMA maps also show much cooler ($\sim3000$ K) and hotter ($\sim11\,000$ K) evolving
features partially seen in other diagnostics. To explain the former, the inversions require the
existence of localized, low temperature regions in the chromosphere where molecules such as CO
could form. The hot features could sustain such high temperatures due to non-equilibrium hydrogen
ionization effects in a shocked chromosphere - a scenario that is supported by low-frequency shock
wave patterns found in the MgII lines probed by IRIS.
