Methods: Stealth CMEs represent a particular class of solar eruptions that are clearly distinguished
in coronagraph observations, but they don't have a clear source signature. A particular type of
stealth CMEs occurs in the trailing current sheet of a previous ejection, therefore, we used the
2.5D MHD package of the code MPI-AMRVAC to numerically simulate consecutive CMEs by imposing shearing
motions onto the inner boundary. The initial magnetic configuration consists of a triple arcade
structure embedded into a bimodal solar wind, and the sheared polarity inversion line is found in
the southern loop system. The mesh was continuously adapted through a refinement method that applies
to current carrying structures. We then compared the obtained eruptions with the observed directions
of propagation of an initial multiple coronal mass ejection (MCME) event that occurred in September
2009. We further analysed the simulated ejections by tracking the centre of their flux ropes in latitude
and their total speed. Radial Poynting flux computation was employed as well to follow the evolution
of electromagnetic energy introduced into the system. Results: Changes within 1\% in the shearing
speed result in three different scenarios for the second CME, although the preceding eruption seems
insusceptible to such small variations. Depending on the applied shearing speed, we thus obtain
a failed eruption, a stealth, or a CME driven by the imposed shear, as the second ejection. The dynamics
of all eruptions are compared with the observed directions of propagation of an MCME event and a good
correlation is achieved. The Poynting flux analysis reveals the temporal variation of the important
steps of eruptions. For the first time, a stealth CME is simulated in the aftermath of a first eruption,
through changes in the applied shearing speed.
