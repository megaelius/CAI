Context. The knowledge of abundance distributions is central to understanding the formation and
evolution of galaxies. Most of the relations employed for the derivation of gas abundances have
so far been derived from observations of outer disk HII regions, despite the known differences between
inner and outer regions. Aims. Using integral field spectroscopy (IFS) observations we aim to perform
a systematic study and comparison of two inner and outer HII regions samples. The spatial resolution
of the IFS, the number of objects and the homogeneity and coherence of the observations allow a complete
characterization of the main observational properties and differences of the regions. Methods.
We analyzed a sample of 725 inner HII regions and a sample of 671 outer HII regions, all of them detected
and extracted from the observations of a sample of 263 nearby, isolated, spiral galaxies observed
by the CALIFA survey. Results. We find that inner HII regions show smaller equivalent widths, greater
extinction and luminosities, along with greater values of [NII]{\lambda}6583/H{\alpha} and
[OII]{\lambda}3727/[OIII]{\lambda}5007 emission-line ratios, indicating higher metallicites
and lower ionization parameters. Inner regions have also redder colors and higher photometric
and ionizing masses, although Mion/Mphot is slighty higher for the outer regions. Conclusions.
This work shows important observational differences between inner and outer HII regions in star
forming galaxies not previously studied in detail. These differences indicate that inner regions
have more evolved stellar populations and are in a later evolution state with respect to outer regions,
which goes in line with the inside-out galaxy formation paradigm.
