The infall regions of galaxy clusters represent the largest gravitationally bound structures
in a $\Lambda$CDM universe. Measuring cluster mass profiles into the infall regions provides an
estimate of the ultimate mass of these haloes. We use the caustic technique to measure cluster mass
profiles from galaxy redshifts obtained with the Hectospec Cluster Survey (HeCS), an extensive
spectroscopic survey of galaxy clusters with MMT/Hectospec. We survey 58 clusters selected by
X-ray flux at 0.1$<$$z$$<$0.3. The survey includes 21,314 unique MMT/Hectospec redshifts
for individual galaxies; 10,275 of these galaxies are cluster members. For each cluster we acquired
high signal-to-noise spectra for $\sim 200$ cluster members and a comparable number of foreground/background
galaxies. The cluster members trace out infall patterns around the clusters. The members define
a very narrow red sequence. The velocity dispersions decline with radius; we demonstrate that the
determination of the velocity dispersion is insensitive to the inclusion of bluer members (a small
fraction of the cluster population). We apply the caustic technique to define membership and estimate
the mass profiles to large radii. The ultimate halo mass of clusters (the mass that remains bound
in the far future of a $\Lambda$CDM universe) is on average (1.99$\pm$0.11)$M_{200}$, a new observational
cosmological test in essential agreement with simulations. Summed profiles binned in $M_{200}$
and in $L_X$ demonstrate that the predicted NFW form of the density profile is a remarkably good representation
of the data in agreement with weak lensing results extending to large radius. The concentration
of these summed profiles is also consistent with theoretical predictions.
