Context. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration recently obtained first images of the
surroundings of the supermassive compact object M87* at the center of the galaxy M87. Aims. We want
to develop a simple analytic disk model for the accretion flow of M87*. Compared to general-relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) models, it has the advantage of being independent of the turbulent
character of the flow, and controlled by only few easy-to-interpret, physically meaningful parameters.
We want to use this model to predict the image of M87* assuming that it is either a Kerr black hole, or
an alternative compact object. Methods. We compute the synchrotron emission from the disk model
and propagate the resulting light rays to the far-away observer by means of relativistic ray tracing.
Such computations are performed assuming different spacetimes (Kerr, Minkowski, non-rotating
ultracompact star, rotating boson star or Lamy spinning wormhole). We perform numerical fits of
these models to the EHT data. Results. We discuss the highly-lensed features of Kerr images and show
that they are intrinsically linked to the accretion-flow properties, and not only to gravitation.
This fact is illustrated by the notion of secondary ring that we introduce. Our model of spinning
Kerr black hole predicts mass and orientation consistent with the EHT interpretation. The non-Kerr
images result in similar quality of the numerical fits and may appear very similar to Kerr images,
once blurred to the EHT resolution. This implies that a strong test of the Kerr spacetime may be out
of reach with the current data. We notice that future developments of the EHT could alter this situation.
Conclusions. Our results show the importance of studying alternatives to the Kerr spacetime in
order to be able to test the Kerr paradigm unambiguously.
