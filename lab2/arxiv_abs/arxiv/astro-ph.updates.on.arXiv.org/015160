We present the results of a new, deeper, and complete search for high-redshift $z > 6.5$ quasars over
977 square degrees of the VISTA Kilo-Degree Infrared Galaxy Survey (VIKING) survey, that is sensitive
out to $z \sim 9.3$. This exploits a new list-driven dataset providing aperture fluxes and uncertainties
in all bands $ZYJHK_s$, for all sources detected by VIKING in $J$. We used the Bayesian model comparison
(BMC) selection method of Mortlock et al., producing a ranked list of just 21 candidates. The sources
ranked 1, 2, 3 and 5 are the four known $z > 6.5$ quasars in this field. Additional observations of the
other 17 candidates, primarily DESI Legacy Survey photometry and ESO FORS2 spectroscopy, confirm
that none is a quasar. This is the first complete sample (i.e., all candidates followed up) from the
VIKING survey, and we provide the computed selection function. We also compute selection functions
for samples produced by two other methods: colour cuts and minimum chi-square SED fitting. Comparison
of the efficiency (fraction of candidates that are quasars) and the depth of the three methods leads
to the following conclusions: i) BMC produces eight times fewer false positives than colour cuts,
while also reaching 0.3 mag. deeper, ii) the SED fitting method is extremely efficient but reaches
0.7 mag less deep than the BMC method, picking out only one of the four known quasars. By additionally
following up BMC candidates rejected because their photometric SEDs have high $\chi^2$ values,
we identify a population of galaxies where very strong [OIII]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 emission
in the $Y$ band can mimic the colours of quasars, i.e., from Ly$\alpha$ and a blue continuum. This
is a potential additional contaminant population in future searches for faint high-redshift quasars
(such as in Euclid), not previously identified as such, and that requires better characterisation.
