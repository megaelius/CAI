The spectrum of the Fe I atom is critical to many areas of astrophysics and beyond. Measurements of
the energies of its high-lying levels remain woefully incomplete, however, despite extensive
analysis of ultraviolet laboratory iron absorption spectra, optical laboratory iron emission
spectra, and the solar infrared spectrum. In this work we use as sources the high-resolution archival
absorption-line ultraviolet and optical spectra of stars, whose warm temperatures favor moderate
Fe I excitation. We derive the energy for a particular upper level by adopting a trial value that yields
the same wavelength for a given line predicted to be about as strong as that of a strong unidentified
spectral line observed in the stellar spectra, then checking the new wavelengths of other strong
predicted transitions that share the same upper level for coincidence with other strong observed
unidentified lines. To date this analysis has provided the upper energies of 37 Fe I levels. Many
new level energies are higher than those accessible to laboratory experiments; several exceed
the Fe I ionization energy. These levels provide new identifications for over a thousand potentially
detectable lines. Almost all of the new levels of odd parity include UV lines that were detected but
unclassified in laboratory Fe I absorption spectra, providing an external check on the energy values.
We motivate and present the procedure, provide the resulting new level energies and their uncertainties,
list all the potentially detectable UV and optical new Fe I line identifications and their gf-values,
and discuss the prospects for additional Fe I energy-level determinations in the near future.
