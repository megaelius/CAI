There is an increasing body of evidence that suggests that Be disks are well described by the Viscous
Decretion Disk (VDD) model according to which the formation and structure of the disk depend on the
kinematic viscosity of the gas. However, most observational tests of the VDD to-date were done for
systems that do not display strong temporal variability. From this analysis we (1) obtain a realistic
physical model of the circumstellar environment; (2) measure the viscosity parameter of the gas,
both during the formation and dissipation phases of the disk; (3) obtain a reliable estimate of the
stellar mass and angular momentum loss rates during outburst. Our simulations suggests that the
VDD model adequately describes the structural evolution of the disk. Furthermore, our analysis
allowed us to determine the viscosity parameter a, as well as the net mass and angular momentum (AM)
loss rates. We find that a is variable, ranging from 0.1 to 1.0, not only from cycle to cycle but also
within a given cycle. Additionally, build-up phases have larger values of a than the dissipation
phases. We also find that, contrary to what is generally assumed, during dissipation the outward
AM flux is not necessarily zero, meaning that {\omega} CMa does not experience a true quiescence
but, instead, switches between a high AM loss rate state to a low AM loss rate one during which the disk
quickly assumes an overall lower density but never zero. We confront the average AM loss rate with
predictions from stellar evolution models for fast-rotating stars, and find that our measurements
are smaller by more than one order of magnitude. The model developed using the V-band photometry
as a constraint was applied to several other observables. Overall, the results of this multi-technique
study were very positive, with a good match for multi-band photometry, polarization, and most spectroscopic
characteristics.
