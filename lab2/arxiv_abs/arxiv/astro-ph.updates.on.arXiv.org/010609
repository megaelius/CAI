HISPEC (High-resolution Infrared Spectrograph for Exoplanet Characterization) is a proposed
diffraction-limited spectrograph for the W.M. Keck Observatory, and a pathfinder for the MODHIS
facility project (Multi-Object Diffraction-limited High-resolution Infrared Spectrograph)
on the Thirty Meter Telescope. HISPEC/MODHIS builds on diffraction-limited spectrograph designs
which rely on adaptively corrected single-mode fiber feeds. Seeing-limited high-resolution
spectrographs, by virtue of the conservation of beam etendue, grow in volume following a D^3 power
law (D is the telescope diameter), and are subject to daunting challenges associated with their
large size. Diffraction-limited spectrographs fed by single mode fibers are decoupled from the
telescope input, and are orders of magnitude more compact and have intrinsically stable line spread
functions. Their efficiency is directly proportional to the performance of the adaptive optics
(AO) system. AO technologies have matured rapidly over the past two decades and are baselined for
future extremely large telescopes. HISPEC/MODHIS will take R>100,000 spectra of a few objects
in a 10" field-of-view sampled at the diffraction limit (~10-50 mas), simultaneously from 0.95
to 2.4 microns (y-K). The scientific scope ranges from exoplanet infrared precision radial velocities,
spectroscopy of transiting, close-in, and directly imaged exoplanets (atmospheric composition
and dynamics, RM effect, spin measurements, Doppler imaging), brown dwarf characterization,
stellar physics/chemistry, proto-planetary disk kinematics/composition, Solar system, extragalactic
science, and cosmology. HISPEC/MODHIS features a compact, cost-effective design optimized to
fully exploit the existing Keck-AO and future TMT-NFIRAOS infrastructures and boost the scientific
reach of Keck Observatory and TMT soon after first light.
