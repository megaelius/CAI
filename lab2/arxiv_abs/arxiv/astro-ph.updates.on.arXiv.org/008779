The Hubble tension between the $\Lambda$CDM-model-dependent prediction of the current expansion
rate $H_0$ using Planck data and direct, model-independent measurements in the local universe
from the SH0ES collaboration disagree at $>3.5\sigma$. Moreover, there exists a milder $\sim 2\sigma$
tension between similar predictions for the amplitude $S_8$ of matter fluctuations and its measurement
in the local universe. As explanations relying on unresolved systematics have not been found, theorists
have been exploring explanations for these anomalies that modify the cosmological model, altering
early-universe-based predictions for these parameters. However, new cosmological models that
attempt to resolve one tension often worsen the other. In this paper, we investigate a decaying dark
matter (DDM) model as a solution to both tensions simultaneously. Here, a fraction of dark matter
density decays into dark radiation. The decay rate $\Gamma$ is proportional to the Hubble rate $H$
through the constant $\alpha_{\rm dr}$, the only additional parameter of this model. Then, this
model deviates most from $\Lambda$CDM in the early universe, with $\alpha_{\rm dr}$ being positively
correlated with $H_0$ and negatively with $S_8$. Hence, increasing $\alpha_{\rm dr}$ can then
diminish both tensions simultaneously. The tensions are reduced to $\sim 1.5 \sigma$ for $H_0$
and $0.3\sigma$ for $S_8$ when only considering Planck CMB data and the local SH0ES prior on $H_0$.
However, the addition of intermediate-redshift data (the JLA supernova dataset and baryon acoustic
oscillation data) weakens the effectiveness of this model, bringing the tensions back up to $\sim
2.5 \sigma$ and $\sim 1.5 \sigma$ respectively.
