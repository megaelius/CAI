The recent discovery of gravitational waves has opened new horizons for physics. Current and upcoming
missions, such as LIGO, VIRGO, KAGRA, and LISA, promise to shed light on black holes of every size
from stellar mass (SBH) sizes up to supermassive black holes which reside in galactic nuclei. The
intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) family has not been detected beyond any reasonable doubt neither
directly nor indirectly. Recent analyses suggest observational evidence for the presence of IMBHs
in the centers of two Galactic globular clusters. In this paper, we investigate the possibility
that globular clusters were born with a central IMBH, which undergo repeated merger events with
SBHs in the cluster core. By means of a semi-analytical method, we follow the evolution of the primordial
cluster population in the galactic potential and the Gravitational Wave (GW) mergers of the binary
IMBH-SBH systems. Our models predict $\approx 1000$ IMBHs within $1$ kpc from the Galactic Center.
Our results show that the IMBH-SBH merger rate density changes from $\mathcal{R}\approx 1000$
Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ beyond $z\approx 2$ to $\mathcal{R}\approx 1-10$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$
at $z\approx 0$. The rates at low redshifts may be significantly higher if young massive star clusters
host IMBHs. The merger rates are dominated by IMBHs with masses between $10^3$ and $10^4\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$.
Currently there are no LIGO/VIRGO upper limits for GW sources in this mass range, but our results
show that at design sensitivity these instruments may detect these IMBH-SBH mergers in the coming
years. \textit{LISA} and the Einstein Telescope will be best suited to detect these GW events. The
inspirals of IMBH-SBH systems may also generate an unresolved GW background.
