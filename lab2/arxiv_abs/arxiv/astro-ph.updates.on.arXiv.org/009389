There are now $\sim$20 multi-dimensional core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations that explode.
However, these simulations have explosion energies that are a few times $10^{50}$ erg, not $10^{51}$
erg. In this manuscript, we compare the inferred explosion energies of these simulations and observations
of 38 SN~IIP. Assuming a log-normal distribution, the mean explosion energy for the observations
is $\mu_{\rm obs} = -0.13\pm 0.05$ ($\log_{10}(E/10^{51}\, {\rm erg})$) and the width is $\sigma_{\rm
obs} = 0.21^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$. Only three CCSN codes have sufficient simulations to compare with
observations: CHIMERA, CoCoNuT-FMT, and FORNAX. Currently, FORNAX has the largest sample of simulations.
The two-dimensional FORNAX simulations show a correlation between explosion energy and progenitor
mass, ranging from linear to quadratic, $E_{\rm sim} \propto M^{1-2}$; this correlation is consistent
with inferences from observations. In addition, we infer the ratio of the observed-to-simulated
explosion energies, $\Delta=\log_{10}(E_{\rm obs}/E_{\rm sim})$. For the CHIMERA set, $\Delta=0.33\pm0.06$;
for CoCoNuT-FMT, $\Delta=0.62\pm0.05$; for FORNAX2D, $\Delta=0.73\pm0.05$, and for FORNAX3D,
$\Delta=0.95\pm0.06$. On average, the simulations are less energetic than inferred energies
from observations ($\Delta \approx 0.7$), but we also note that the variation among the simulations
(max($\Delta$)-min($\Delta$) $\approx 0.6$) is as large as this average offset. This suggests
that further improvements to the simulations could resolve the discrepancy. Furthermore, both
the simulations and the observations are heavily biased. In this preliminary comparison, we model
these biases, but to more reliably compare the explosion energies, we recommend strategies to un-bias
both the simulations and observations.
