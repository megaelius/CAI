In this paper I review some recent, interlinked, work undertaken using cosmological perturbation
theory -- a powerful technique for modelling inhomogeneities in the Universe. The common theme
which underpins these pieces of work is the presence of non-adiabatic pressure, or entropy, perturbations.
After a brief introduction covering the standard techniques of describing inhomogeneities in
both Newtonian and relativistic cosmology, I discuss the generation of vorticity. As in classical
fluid mechanics, vorticity is not present in linearized perturbation theory (unless included
as an initial condition). Allowing for entropy perturbations, and working to second order in perturbation
theory, I show that vorticity is generated, even in the absence of vector perturbations, by purely
scalar perturbations, the source term being quadratic in the gradients of first order energy density
and isocurvature, or non-adiabatic pressure perturbations. This generalizes Crocco's theorem
to a cosmological setting. I then introduce isocurvature perturbations in different models, focusing
on the entropy perturbation in standard, concordance cosmology, and in inflationary models involving
two scalar fields. As the final topic, I investigate magnetic fields, which are a potential observational
consequence of vorticity in the early universe. I briefly review some recent work on including magnetic
fields in perturbation theory in a consistent way. I show, using solely analytical techniques,
that magnetic fields can be generated by higher order perturbations, albeit too small to provide
the entire primordial seed field, in agreement with some numerical studies. I close with a summary
and some potential extensions of this work.
