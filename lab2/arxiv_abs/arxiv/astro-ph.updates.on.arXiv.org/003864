We present MUSE observations of the field of the quasar Q0152$-$020 whose spectrum shows a Lyman
limit system (LLS) at redshift $z_{\rm abs} = 0.38$, with a metallicity Z $\gtrsim 0.06$ Z$_\odot$.
The low ionization metal lines associated with the LLS present two narrow distinct absorption components
with a velocity separation of 26 km ${\rm s}^{-1}$. We detect six galaxies within 600 km ${\rm s}^{-1}$
from the absorption redshift; their projected distances from the quasar sightline range from 60
to 200 kpc. The optical spectra of five of these galaxies exhibit prominent nebular emission lines,
from which we deduce extinction-corrected star formation rates in the range SFR = 0.06-1.3 M$_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$,
and metallicities between 0.2 Z$_\odot$ and Z$_\odot$. The sixth galaxy is only detected in the
stellar continuum. By combining our data with archival Keck/HIRES spectroscopy of the quasar and
HST/WFPC2 imaging of the field, we can relate absorption line and galaxy kinematics; we conclude
that the LLS is most likely associated with the galaxy closest to the quasar sight-line (galaxy "a").
Our morphokinematic analysis of galaxy "a" combined with the absorption line kinematics supports
the interpretation that one of the absorption components originates from an extension of the stellar
disk of galaxy "a", while the other component may arise in accreting gas in a warped disk with specific
angular momentum $\sim 3$ times larger than the specific angular momentum of the galaxy halo. Such
warped disks are common features in hydrodynamical simulations of cold-flow accretion onto galaxies;
the data presented here provide observational evidence in favour of this scenario.
