We carry out a series of local, vertically stratified shearing box simulations of protoplanetary
disks that include ambipolar diffusion and a net vertical magnetic field. The ambipolar diffusion
profiles we employ correspond to 30AU and 100AU in a minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN) disk model,
which consists of a far-UV-ionized surface layer and low-ionization disk interior. These simulations
serve as a follow up to Simon et al. (2013), in which we found that without a net vertical field, the
turbulent stresses that result from the magnetorotational instability (MRI) are too weak to account
for observed accretion rates. The simulations in this work show a very strong dependence of the accretion
stresses on the strength of the background vertical field; as the field strength increases, the
stress amplitude increases. For gas to magnetic pressure ratios of 1e4 and 1e5, we find accretion
rates between 1e-8 and 1e-7 solar masses per year. These accretion rates agree with observational
constraints, suggesting a vertical magnetic field strength between 60 and 200 microgauss at 30AU
and 10 and 30 microgauss at 100AU in a MMSN disk. Furthermore, the stress has a non-negligible component
due to a magnetic wind. For sufficiently strong vertical field strengths, MRI turbulence is quenched,
and the flow becomes largely laminar, with accretion proceeding through large scale correlations
in the radial and toroidal field components as well as through the magnetic wind. In all simulations,
the presence of a low ionization region near the disk mid-plane, which we call the ambipolar damping
zone, results in reduced stresses there.
