This study is based on the use of the new ExoMol TiO rovibronic line lists to identify and model TiO
isotopologue features in spectra of M-dwarfs. We aim to investigate problems involving the computation
of electronic bands for different isotopologues of TiO by modelling optical spectra of late-type
stars and to determine their Ti isotopic abundances, to compare the TiO isotopologues spectra computed
using line lists by different authors. We fit theoretical synthetic spectra to the observed stellar
molecular bands of TiO. We model spectra of two M-dwarfs: GJ 15A (M1V) and GJ 15B (M3 V) to determine
Ti isotopic ratios in their atmospheres. We demonstrate the accuracy of the ExoMol {\sc Toto} line
list for differentisotopologues of TiO and the possibility of determining accurate Ti isotope
abundances in a numberof spectral ranges. The 7580--7594 \AA\ spectral range seems particularly
useful, with two atomic linesof Fe I and molecular band heads of $^{50}Ti$O, $^{49}Ti$O, $^{48}Ti$O,
$^{47}Ti$O clearly observable in our two M-dwarf spectra. We determine non-solar Ti isotopic ratios
of $^{46}Ti$ : $^{47}Ti$ : $^{48}Ti$ : $^{49}Ti$ : $^{50}Ti$ = 7.9 : 5.2 : 72.8 : 7.9 :6.2 for GJ 15A and
7.4 : 4.2 : 76.6 : 5.8 : 6.0 for GJ 15B with accuracy of order $\pm$ 0.2. [Ti] = 0.040 and 0.199 within accuracy
$\pm$ 0.10 were also determined for GJ 15A and GJ 15B, respectively. We find that the ExoMol {\sc Toto}
TiO line list: a) describes the fine details in line position and intensities of the M-dwarf spectra
better than other available TiO line lists; b) correctly reproduces the positions and intensities
of the TiO isotopologue band heads observed in M-dwarf spectra; c) can be used to determine Ti isotope
abundances in atmospheres of M-stars.
