V1118 Ori is a classical EXor source whose light curve has been monitored over the past thirty years
(although not continuously). It underwent a powerful outburst in 2005, followed by ten years of
quiescence and a less intense outburst in 2015. In 2019, a new intense brightness increase was observed
($\Delta g$ $\sim$ 3 mag). This new accretion episode offers the opportunity to compare the photometric
and spectroscopic properties of different outbursts of the same source. This allows one to highlight
differences and similarities among different events by removing any possible bias related to the
intrinsic properties of the star-disk system. We discovered the 2019 V1118 Ori outburst by examining
the $g$-band light curve acquired by the Zwicky Transient Facility and followed the decreasing
phase with the Rapid Eye Mount telescope in the $griz$ bands. Two near-infrared spectra were also
acquired at different brightness stages with the Large Binocular Telescope. The last event shows
the following characteristics: 1) amplitude similar than in 2015 and lower than in 2005; 2) duration
less than one year as in previous events; 3) rise (decline) speed of 0.018 (0.031) mag/day, which
is different from previous cases; 4) a gradual blueing of the [$g-r$] color is observed over time,
while the [$r-i$] color remains roughly unchanged; 5) with few exceptions, the near-infrared lines
(mainly HI recombination) are the same observed in 2015; 6) the mass accretion rate peaks at Macc
$\sim$ 10$^{-7}$ Msun/yr, and decreases in about a month down to a few 10$^{-8}$ Msun/yr. Our analysis
shows that the comparison of data from different outbursts of the same source is a non-trivial exercise,
which allows obtaining important clues useful to drive theoretical efforts towards a better understanding
of the EXor phenomenon.
