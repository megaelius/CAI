Using ALMA, we observed the stellar wind of two oxygen-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars,
IK Tau and R Dor, between 335 and 362 GHz. One aim was to detect metal oxides and metal hydroxides (AlO,
AlOH, FeO, MgO, MgOH), some of which are thought to be direct precursors of dust nucleation and growth.
We report on the potential first detection of FeO (v=0, Omega=4, J=11-10) in RDor (mass-loss rate,
Mdot, ~1e-7 Msun/yr). The presence of FeO in IK Tau (Mdot~5e-6 Msun/yr) cannot be confirmed due to
a blend with 29SiS, a molecule that is absent in R Dor. The detection of AlO in R Dor and of AlOH in IK Tau
was reported earlier by Decin et al. (2017). All other metal oxides and hydroxides, as well as MgS,
remain undetected. We derive a column density N(FeO) of 1.1+/-0.9e15 cm^{-2} in R Dor, or a fractional
abundance [FeO/H]~1.5e-8 accounting for non-LTE effects. The derived fractional abundance [FeO/H]
is a factor ~20 larger than conventional gas-phase chemical kinetic predictions. This discrepancy
may be partly accounted for by the role of vibrationally excited OH in oxidizing Fe, or may be evidence
for other currently unrecognised chemical pathways producing FeO. Assuming a constant fractional
abundance w.r.t. H_2, the upper limits for the other metals are [MgO/H_2] <5.5e-10 (R Dor) and <7e-11
(IK Tau), [MgOH/H_2] <9e-9 (R Dor) and <1e-9 (IK Tau), [CaO/H_2] <2.5e-9 (R Dor) and <1e-10 (IK Tau),
[CaOH/H_2] <6.5e-9 (R Dor) and <9e-10 (IK Tau), and [MgS/H_$] <4.5e-10 (R Dor) and <6e-11 (IK Tau).
The retrieved upper limit abundances for these latter molecules are in accord with the chemical
model predictions.
