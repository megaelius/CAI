Blue straggler stars (BSS) are abundantly observed in all Galactic globular clusters (GGC) where
data exist. However, observations alone cannot reveal the relative importance of various formation
channels or the typical formation times for this well studied population of non-standard stars.
Using a state of the art H\'enon-type Monte Carlo code that includes all relevant physical processes,
and observationally motivated initial conditions in large ranges in density, concentration,
binary fraction, and mass, we create a little over 100 models with properties typical of the observed
GGCs. These models can be directly compared with the observed GGCs and BSSs can be easily identified.
We identify the BSSs in our models and determine their formation channels and times of creation.
We find that for central densities above 10^3 Msun/pc^3 the dominant formation channel is stellar
collisions. The majority of these collisions happen via binary-mediated strong scattering encounters.
As a result a strong correlation between the total number of BSSs and the binary fraction in a cluster
can be observed. We find that the number of BSSs in the core show weak correlation with the collision
rate Gamma. Close inspection of our models reveals that the observed lack of correlation between
the number of BSSs and Gamma for the observed GGCs may be because the estimate of Gamma using observed
cluster properties is not a reliable indicator of the true Gamma. Our models indicate that the BSSs
observed today may have formed many Gyrs ago. Denser clusters have higher contributions from collisions
which typically create higher mass BSSs compared to those created via mass-transfer in a binary.
As a result, we find that the BSSs in denser clusters typically have formed more recently than those
in sparser clusters.
