As the second part of our study, in this paper we proceed to explore the dynamics of the high-inclination
Twotinos in the 1:2 Neptune mean motion resonance (NMMR). Depending on the inclination $i$, we show
the existence of two critical eccentricities $e_a(i)$ and $e_c(i)$, which are lower limits for
the eccentricity $e$ for the resonant angle $\sigma$ to exhibit libration and asymmetric libration,
respectively. Accordingly, we have determined the libration centres $\sigma_0$ for inclined
orbits, which are strongly dependent on $i$ and could be very different from the zero-$i$ case. With
the initial $\sigma=\sigma_0$ on a fine grid of $(e, i)$, the long-term stability of orbits in the
1:2 NMMR is probed by numerical integrations for the age of the Solar system. It is shown that symmetric
librators are totally unstable for $i\ge30^{\circ}$; while stable asymmetric librators do exist
for $i$ as high as $90^{\circ}$, and they generally have resonant amplitudes $A_{\sigma}<50^{\circ}$.
We further investigate the 1:2 NMMR capture and retention of planetesimals with initial inclinations
$i_0\le90^{\circ}$ in the planet migration model using a long time-scale of $2\times10^7$ yr.
We find that: (1) the capture efficiency of the 1:2 NMMR decreases drastically with the increase
of $i_0$, and it goes to 0 when $i_0$ exceeds $\sim60^{\circ}$; (2) the probability of discovering
Twotinos with $i>25^{\circ}$, beyond their observed values, is roughly estimated to be only
$\sim0.1$ per cent; (3) more particles are captured into the leading rather than the trailing asymmetric
resonance for $i_0\le10^{\circ}$, but this number difference appears to be the opposite at $i_0=20^{\circ}$
and is continuously varying for even larger $i_0$; (4) captured Twotinos residing in the trailing
islands or having $i>15^{\circ}$ are practically outside the Kozai mechanism, like currently
observed samples.
