Collisions and interactions between gas-rich galaxies are thought to be pivotal stages in their
formation and evolution, causing the rapid production of new stars, and possibly serving as a mechanism
for fueling supermassive black holes (BH). Harnessing the exquisite spatial resolution (~0.5
arcsec) afforded by the first ~170 deg^2 of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey, we present our new
constraints on the importance of galaxy-galaxy major mergers (1:4) in growing BHs throughout the
last ~8 Gyrs. Utilizing mid-infrared observations in the WISE All-Sky survey, we robustly select
active galactic nuclei (AGN) and mass-matched control galaxy samples, totaling ~140,000 spectroscopically
confirmed systems at i<22 mag. We identify galaxy interaction signatures using a novel machine-learning
random forest decision tree technique allowing us to select statistically significant samples
of major-mergers, minor-mergers/irregular-systems, and non-interacting galaxies. We use these
samples to show that galaxies undergoing mergers are a factor ~2-7 more likely to contain luminous
obscured AGN than non-interacting galaxies, and this is independent of both stellar mass and redshift
to z < 0.9. Furthermore, based on our comparison of AGN fractions in mass-matched samples, we determine
that the most luminous AGN population (L_AGN > 10^45 erg/s) systematically reside in merging systems
over non-interacting galaxies. Our findings show that galaxy-galaxy interactions do, on average,
trigger luminous AGN activity substantially more often than in secularly evolving non-interacting
galaxies, and we further suggest that the BH growth rate may be closely tied to the dynamical time
of the merger system.
