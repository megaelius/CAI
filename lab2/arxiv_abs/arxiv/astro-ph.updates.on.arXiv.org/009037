Matter in neutron star collisions can reach densities up to few times the nuclear saturation threshold
and temperatures up to one hundred MeV. Understanding the structure and composition of such matter
requires many-body nonperturbative calculations that are currently highly uncertain.Unique
constraints on the neutron star matter are provided by gravitational-wave observations aided
by numerical relativity simulations. In this work, we explore the thermodynamical conditions
of matter and radiation along the merger dynamics. We consider 3 microphysical equation of state
models and numerical relativity simulations including an approximate neutrino transport scheme.
The neutron star cores collision and their multiple centrifugal bounces heat the initially cold
matter to several tens of MeV. Streams of hot matter with initial densities $\sim1-2\rho_0$ move
outwards and cool due to decompression and neutrino emission. The merger can result in a neutron
star remnant with densities up to $3-5\rho_0$ and temperatures $\sim 50$~MeV. The highest temperatures
are confined in an approximately spherical annulus at densities $\sim\rho_0$. Such temperatures
favour positron-neutron capture at densities $\sim\rho_0$, thus leading to a neutrino emission
dominated by electron antineutrinos. We study the impact of trapped neutrinos on the remnant matter's
pressure, electron fraction and temperature and find that it has a negligible effect. Disks around
neutron star or black hole remnant are neutron rich and not isentropic, but they differ in size, entropy
and lepton fraction depending on the nature of the central object. In presence of a black hole, disks
are smaller and mostly transparent to neutrinos; in presence of a massive neutron star, they are
more massive, geometrically and optically thick.
