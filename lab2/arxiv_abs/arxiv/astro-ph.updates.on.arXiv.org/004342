We present a detailed X-ray spectral study of the quasar PG 1211+143 based on Chandra High Energy
Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) observations collected in a multi-wavelength campaign
with UV data using the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (HST-COS) and radio bands
using the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). We constructed a multi-wavelength ionizing spectral energy
distribution using these observations and archival infrared data to create XSTAR photoionization
models specific to the PG 1211+143 flux behavior during the epoch of our observations. Our analysis
of the Chandra-HETGS spectra yields complex absorption lines from H-like and He-like ions of Ne,
Mg and Si which confirm the presence of an ultra-fast outflow with a velocity ~ $-$17,300 km s$^{-1}$
(outflow redshift $z_{\rm out}$ ~ $-$0.0561) in the rest frame of PG 1211+143. This absorber is well
described by an ionization parameter $\log \xi$ ~ 2.9 erg s$^{-1}$ cm and column density $\log N_{\rm
H}$ ~ 21.5 cm$^{-2}$. This corresponds to a stable region of the absorber's thermal stability curve,
and furthermore its implied neutral hydrogen column is broadly consistent with a broad Ly$\alpha$
absorption line at a mean outflow velocity of ~ $-$16,980 km s$^{-1}$ detected by our HST-COS observations.
Our findings represent the first simultaneous detection of an ultra-fast outflow in both X-ray
and UV observations. Our VLA observations provide evidence for an active jet in PG 1211+143, which
may be connected to the X-ray and UV outflows; this possibility can be evaluated using very-long-baseline
interferometric (VLBI) observations.
