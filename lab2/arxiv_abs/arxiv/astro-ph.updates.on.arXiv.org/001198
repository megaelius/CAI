We derive an estimator of weak gravitational lensing shear from background galaxy images that avoids
noise-induced biases through a rigorous Bayesian treatment of the measurement. The derived shear
estimator disposes with the assignment of ellipticities to individual galaxies that is typical
of previous approaches to galaxy lensing. Shear estimates from the mean of the Bayesian posterior
are unbiased in the limit of large number of background galaxies, regardless of the noise level on
individual galaxies. The Bayesian formalism requires a prior describing the (noiseless) distribution
of the target galaxy population over some parameter space; this prior can be constructed from low-noise
images of a subsample of the target population, attainable from long integrations of a fraction
of the survey field. We find two ways to combine this exact treatment of noise with rigorous treatment
of the effects of the instrumental point-spread function and sampling. The Bayesian model fitting
(BMF) method assigns a likelihood of the pixel data to galaxy models (e.g. Sersic ellipses). The
Bayesian Fourier domain (BFD) method compresses the pixel data to a small set of weighted moments
calculated after PSF correction in Fourier space. A numerical test using a simplified model of a
biased galaxy measurement process demonstrates that the Bayesian formalism recovers applied
shears to $<1$ part in $10^3$ accuracy and provides accurate uncertainty estimates. BFD is the
first shear measurement algorithm that is model-free and requires no approximations or ad hoc assumptions
in correcting for the effects of PSF, noise, or sampling on the galaxy images. These algorithms are
good candidates for attaining the part-per-thousand shear inference required for hemisphere-scale
weak gravitational lensing surveys. (abridged)
