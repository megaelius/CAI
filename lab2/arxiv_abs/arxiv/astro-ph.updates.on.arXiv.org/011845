The discovery of quasars few hundred megayears after the Big Bang represents a major challenge to
our understanding of black holes and galaxy formation and evolution. Their luminosity is produced
by extreme gas accretion onto black holes, which already reached masses of 10$^9$ M$_\odot$ by z
~ 6. Simultaneously, their host galaxies form hundreds of stars per year, using up gas in the process.
To understand which environments are able to sustain the rapid formation of these extreme sources
we started a VLT/MUSE effort aimed at characterizing the surroundings of a sample of 5.7 < z < 6.6 quasars
dubbed: the Reionization Epoch QUasar InvEstigation with MUSE (REQUIEM) survey. We here present
results of our searches for extended Ly-Alpha halos around the first 31 targets observed as part
of this program. Reaching 5-sigma surface brightness limits of 0.1-1.1 x 10$^{-17}$ erg/s/cm$^2$/arcsec$^2$
over a 1 arcsec$^2$ aperture, we were able to unveil the presence of 12 Ly-Alpha nebulae, 8 of which
are newly discovered. The detected nebulae show a variety of emission properties and morphologies
with luminosities ranging from 8 x 10$^{42}$ to 2 x 10$^{44}$ erg/s, FWHMs between 300 and 1700 km/s,
sizes < 30 pkpc, and redshifts consistent with those of the quasar host galaxies. As the first statistical
and homogeneous investigation of the circum-galactic medium of massive galaxies at the end of the
reionization epoch, the REQUIEM survey enables the study of the evolution of the cool gas surrounding
quasars in the first 3 Gyr of the Universe. A comparison with the extended Ly-Alpha emission observed
around bright (M$_{1450}$ < -25 mag) quasars at intermediate redshift indicates little variations
on the properties of the cool gas from z ~ 6 to z ~ 3 followed by a decline in the average surface brightness
down to z ~ 2.
