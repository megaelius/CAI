We present a search for CII emission over cosmological scales at high-redshifts. The CII line is
a prime candidate to be a tracer of star formation over large-scale structure since it is one of the
brightest emission lines from galaxies. Redshifted CII emission appears in the submillimeter
regime, meaning it could potentially be present in the higher frequency intensity data from the
Planck satellite used to measure the cosmic infrared background (CIB). We search for CII emission
over redshifts z=2-3.2 in the Planck 545 GHz intensity map by cross-correlating the 3 highest frequency
Planck maps with spectroscopic quasars and CMASS galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III
(SDSS-III), which we then use to jointly fit for CII intensity, CIB parameters, and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich
(SZ) emission. We report a measurement of an anomalous emission $\mathrm{I_\nu}=5.7^{+4.8}_{-4.2}\times10^4$
Jy/sr at 95% confidence, which could be explained by CII emission, favoring collisional excitation
models of CII emission that tend to be more optimistic than models based on CII luminosity scaling
relations from local measurements; however, a comparison of Bayesian information criteria reveal
that this model and the CIB & SZ only model are equally plausible. Thus, more sensitive measurements
will be needed to confirm the existence of large-scale CII emission at high redshifts. Finally,
we forecast that intensity maps from Planck cross-correlated with quasars from the Dark Energy
Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) would increase our sensitivity to CII emission by a factor of 5,
while the proposed Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) could increase the sensitivity further
while allowing for greater separation of interloping lines due to its high spectral resolution.
