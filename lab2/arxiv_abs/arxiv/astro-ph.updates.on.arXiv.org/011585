(Abridged) Palomar Gattini-IR is a new wide-field, near-infrared robotic time domain survey operating
at Palomar Observatory. Using a 30 cm telescope mounted with a H2RG detector, Gattini-IR achieves
a field of view of 25 sq. deg. with a pixel scale of 8.7" in J-band. Here, we describe the system design,
survey operations, data processing system and on-sky performance of Palomar Gattini-IR. As a part
of the nominal survey, Gattini-IR scans $\approx 7500$ square degrees of the sky every night to a
median 5$\sigma$ depth of $15.7$ AB mag outside the Galactic plane. The survey covers $\approx 15000$
square degrees of the sky visible from Palomar with a median cadence of 2 days. A real-time data processing
system produces stacked science images from dithered raw images taken on sky, together with PSF-fit
source catalogs and transient candidates identified from subtractions within a median delay of
$\approx 4$ hours from the time of observation. The calibrated data products achieve an astrometric
accuracy (RMS) of $\approx 0.7$" with respect to Gaia DR2 for sources with S/N $> 10$, and better than
$\approx 0.35$" for sources brighter than $\approx 12$ Vega mag. The photometric accuracy (RMS)
achieved in the PSF-fit source catalogs is better than $\approx 3$% for sources brighter than $\approx
12$ Vega mag, as calibrated against the 2MASS catalog. With a field of view $\approx 40\times$ larger
than any other existing near infrared imaging instrument, Gattini-IR is probing the reddest and
dustiest transients in the local universe such as dust obscured supernovae in nearby galaxies,
novae behind large columns of extinction within the galaxy, reddened micro-lensing events in the
Galactic plane and variability from cool and dust obscured stars. We present results from transients
and variables identified since the start of the commissioning period.
