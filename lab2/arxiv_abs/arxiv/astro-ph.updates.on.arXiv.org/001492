Composite supernova remnants (SNRs) constitute a small subclass of the remnants of massive stellar
explosions where non-thermal radiation is observed from both the expanding shell-like shock front
and from a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) located inside of the SNR. These systems represent a unique evolutionary
phase of SNRs where observations in the radio, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray regimes allow the study of
the co-evolution of both these energetic phenomena. In this article, we report results from observations
of the shell-type SNR G15.4+0.1 performed with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.)
and XMM-Newton. A compact TeV $\gamma$-ray source, HESSJ1818-154, located in the center and contained
within the shell of G15.4+0.1 is detected by H.E.S.S. and featurs a spectrum best represented by
a power-law model with a spectral index of $-2.3 \pm 0.3_{stat} \pm 0.2_{sys}$ and an integral flux
of F$(>$0.42$\,\mathrm{TeV}$)=($0.9 \pm 0.3_{\mathrm{stat}} \pm 0.2_{\mathrm{sys}})
\times 10^{-12}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. Furthermore, a recent observation with XMM-Newton reveals
extended X-ray emission strongly peaked in the center of G15.4+0.1. The X-ray source shows indications
of an energy-dependent morphology featuring a compact core at energies above 4 keV and more extended
emission that fills the entire region within the SNR at lower energies. Together, the X-ray and VHE
$\gamma$-ray emission provide strong evidence of a PWN located inside the shell of G15.4+0.1, and
this SNR can therefore be classified as a \emph{composite} based on these observations. The radio,
X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray emission from the PWN is compatible with a one-zone leptonic model that
requires a low average magnetic field inside the emission region. An unambiguous counterpart to
the putative pulsar, which is thought to power the PWN, has been detected neither in radio nor in X-ray
observations of G15.4+0.1.
