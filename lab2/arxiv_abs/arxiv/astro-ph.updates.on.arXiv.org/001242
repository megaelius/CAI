Using a combination of high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope/WFPC2 observations, we explore
the physical properties of the stellar populations in two intermediate-age star clusters in the
Large Magellanic Cloud, NGC 1831 and NGC 1868, based on their color-magnitude diagrams. We show
that both clusters exhibit extended main-sequence turn-offs. To explain the observations, we
consider variations in helium abundance, binarity, age dispersions, and fast rotation of the clusters'
member stars. The observed narrow main sequence excludes significant variations in helium abundance
in both clusters. We first establish the clusters' main-sequence binary fractions using the bulk
of the clusters' main-sequence stellar populations >1 mag below their turn-offs. The extent
of the turn-off regions in color--magnitude space, corrected for the effects of binarity, implies
that age spreads of order 300 Myr may be inferred for both clusters if the stellar distributions in
color--magnitude space were entirely due to the presence of multiple populations characterized
by an age range. Invoking rapid rotation of the population of cluster members characterized by a
single age also allows us to match the observed data in detail. However, when taking into account
the extent of the red clump in color--magnitude space, we encounter an apparent conflict for NGC
1831 between the age dispersion derived from that based on the extent of the main-sequence turn-off
and that implied by the compact red clump. We therefore conclude that, for this cluster, variations
in stellar rotation rate are preferred over an age dispersion. For NGC 1868, both models perform
equally well.
