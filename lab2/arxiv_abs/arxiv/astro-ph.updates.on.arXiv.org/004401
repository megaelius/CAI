Determining molecular abundance ratios is important not only for the study of the Galactic chemistry
but also because they are useful to estimate physical parameters in a large variety of interstellar
medium environments. The CO is one of the most important molecules to trace the molecular gas in the
interstellar medium, and the 13CO/C18O abundance ratio is usually used to estimate molecular masses
and densities of regions with moderate to high densities. Nowadays this kind of isotopes ratios
are in general indirectly derived from elemental abundances ratios. We present the first 13CO/C18O
abundance ratio study performed from CO isotopes observations towards a large sample of Galactic
sources of different nature at different locations. To study the 13CO/C18O abundance ratio it was
used 12CO J=3-2 data obtained form the CO High-Resolution Survey, 13CO and C18O J=3-2 data from the
13CO/C18O (J=3-2) Heterodyne Inner Milky Way Plane Survey, and some complementary data extracted
from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope database. It was analyzed a sample of 198 sources composed
by young stellar objects (YSOs), HII and diffuse HII regions as catalogued in the Red MSX Source Survey
in 27.5 < l < 46.5 and |b| < 0.5. Most of the analyzed sources are located in the galactocentric distance
range 4.0-6.5 kpc. We found that YSOs have, in average, smaller 13CO/C18O abundance ratios than
HII and diffuse HII regions. Taking into account that the gas associated with YSOs should be less
affected by the radiation than in the case of the others sources, selective far-UV photodissociation
of C18O is confirmed. The 13CO/C18O abundance ratios obtained in this work are systematically lower
than the predicted from the known elemental abundance relations. These results would be useful
in future studies of molecular gas related to YSOs and HII regions based on the observation of these
isotopes.
