We introduce the "Engineering Dwarfs at Galaxy formation's Edge" (EDGE) project to study the cosmological
formation and evolution of the smallest galaxies in the Universe. In this first paper, we explore
the effects of resolution and sub-grid physics on a single low mass halo ($M_{\rm halo}=10^{9}~M_\odot$),
simulated to redshift $z=0$ at a mass and spatial resolution of $\sim 20~M_\odot$ and $\sim 3$ pc.
We consider different star formation prescriptions, supernova feedback strengths and on-the-fly
radiative transfer (RT). We show that RT changes the mode of galactic self-regulation at this halo
mass, suppressing star formation by causing the interstellar and circumgalactic gas to remain
predominantly warm ($\sim 10^4$ K) even before cosmic reionisation. By contrast, without RT, star
formation regulation occurs only through starbursts and their associated vigorous galactic outflows.
In spite of this difference, the entire simulation suite (with the exception of models without any
feedback) matches observed dwarf galaxy sizes, velocity dispersions, $V$-band magnitudes and
dynamical mass-to-light-ratios. This is because such structural scaling relations are predominantly
set by the host dark matter halo, with the remaining model-to-model variation being smaller than
the observational scatter. We find that only the stellar mass-metallicity relation differentiates
the galaxy formation models. Explosive feedback ejects more metals from the dwarf, leading to a
lower metallicity at a fixed stellar mass. We conclude that the stellar mass-metallicity relation
of the very smallest galaxies provides a unique constraint on galaxy formation physics.
