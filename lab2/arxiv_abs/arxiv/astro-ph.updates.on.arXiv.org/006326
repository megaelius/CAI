We present a simple and well defined prescription to compare absorption lines in supernova (SN)
spectra with lists of transitions drawn from the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) database. The method is designed to be applicable to simple spectra where the photosphere
can be mostly described by absorptions from single transitions with a single photospheric velocity.
These conditions are plausible for SN spectra obtained shortly after explosion. Here we show that
the method also works well for spectra of hydrogen-poor (Type I) superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I)
around peak. Analysis of high signal to noise spectra leads to clear identification of numerous
spectroscopic features arising from ions of carbon and oxygen, that account for the majority of
absorption features detected in the optical range, suggesting the outer envelope of SLSN-I progenitors
is dominated by these elements. We find that the prominent absorption features seen in the blue are
dominated by numerous lines of OII, as previously suggested, and that the apparent absorption feature
widths are dominated by line density and not by doppler broadening. In fact, we find that while the
expansion velocities of SLSNe-I around peak are similar to those of normal SNe, the apparent velocity
distribution (manifest as the width of single transition features) is much lower (~1500 km/s) indicating
emission from a very narrow photosphere in velocity space that is nevertheless expanding rapidly.
We inspect the controversial case of ASASSN-15lh, and find that the early spectrum of this object
is not consistent with those of SLSNe-I. We also show that SLSNe that initially lack hydrogen features
but develop these at late phases, such as iPTF15esb and iPTF16bad, also differ in their early spectra
from standard SLSNe-I.
