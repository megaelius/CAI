Narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1s) constitute the AGN subclass associated with systematically
smaller black hole masses. A few radio loud ones have been detected in MeV -- GeV energy bands by Fermi
and evidence for the presence of blazar-like jets has been accumulated. In this study we wish to quantify
the temporal behaviour of the optical polarisation, fraction and angle, for a selected sample of
radio loud NLSy1s. We also search for rotations of the polarisation plane similar to those commonly
observed in blazars. We have conducted R-band optical polarisation monitoring of a sample of 10
RL NLSy1s 5 of which have been previously detected by Fermi. The dataset includes observations with
the RoboPol, KANATA, Perkins and Steward polarimeters. In the cases where evidences for long rotations
of the polarisation plane are found, we carry out numerical simulations to assess the probability
that they are caused by intrinsically evolving EVPAs instead of observational noise. Even our moderately
sampled sources show indications of variability, both in polarisation fraction and angle. For
the four best sampled objects in our sample we find multiple periods of significant polarisation
angle variability. In the two best sampled cases, namely J1505+0326 and J0324+3410, we find indications
for three long rotations. We show that although noise can induce the observed behaviour, it is much
more likely that the apparent rotation is caused by intrinsic evolution of the EVPA. To our knowledge
this is the very first detection of such events in this class of sources. In the case of the largest
dataset (J0324+3410) we find that the EVPA concentrates around a direction which is at 49.3\degr
to the 15-GHz radio jet implying a projected magnetic field at an angle of 40.7\degr to that axis.
