Observations of neutron stars, whether in binaries or in isolation, provide information about
the internal structure of the most extreme material objects in the Universe. In this work, we combine
information from recent observations to place joint constraints on the properties of neutron star
matter. We use (i) lower limits on the maximum mass of neutron stars obtained through radio observations
of heavy pulsars, (ii) constraints on tidal properties inferred through the gravitational waves
neutron star binaries emit as they coalesce, and (iii) information about neutron stars' masses
and radii obtained through X-ray emission from surface hotspots. In order to combine information
from such distinct messengers while avoiding the kind of modeling systematics intrinsic to parametric
inference schemes, we employ a nonparametric representation of the neutron-star equation of state
based on Gaussian processes conditioned on nuclear theory models. We find that existing astronomical
observations imply $R_{1.4}=12.32^{+1.09}_{-1.47}\,$km for the radius of a $1.4\,M_{\odot}$
neutron star and $p(2\rho_\mathrm{nuc})=3.8^{+2.7}_{-2.9}\times10^{34}\,\mathrm{dyn}/\mathrm{cm}^2$
for the pressure at twice nuclear saturation density at the $90\%$ credible level. The upper bounds
are driven by the gravitational wave observations, while X-ray and heavy pulsar observations drive
the lower bounds. Additionally, we compute expected constraints from potential future astronomical
observations and find that they can jointly determine $R_{1.4}$ to ${\cal{O}}(1)\,$km and $p(2\rho_\mathrm{nuc})$
to $80\%$ relative uncertainty in the next five years.
