We explore a sample of barred galaxies in the Auriga magneto-hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in
simulations that form boxy/peanut (b/p) bulges. The morphology of bars and b/p's vary for different
mono-abundance populations, according to their kinematic properties, which are in turn set by
the galaxy's assembly history. We find that the Auriga galaxies which best reproduce the chemo-kinematic
properties of the Milky Way bulge have a negligible fraction of ex-situ stars in the b/p region ($<1\%$),
with flattened, thick disc-like metal-poor stellar populations, and with their last major merger
occurring at $t_{\rm lookback}>12\,\rm Gyrs$. This imposes an upper limit on the stellar mass ratio
of subsequent mergers, which we find is broadly consistent with the recently proposed Gaia Sausage/Enceladus
merger. The average fraction of ex-situ stars in the central regions of Auriga galaxies that form
b/p's is $3\%$ -- significantly lower than in those which do not form bars or b/p's. While these central
regions contain the oldest populations, they also have stars younger than 5Gyrs ($>30\%$) and exhibit
X-shaped age and abundance distributions. Examining the inner discs of galaxies in our sample,
we find that in some cases a metal-rich, star-forming inner ring forms, which surrounds the bar.
Further out, bar-induced resonances form ridges in the $V_{\phi}-r$ plane -- the longest of which
is due to the Outer Lindblad Resonance -- which are younger and more metal-rich than the surrounding
phase-space. Our results suggest an in-situ origin for the Milky Way bulge and highlight the significant
effect the bar can have on the surrounding disc.
