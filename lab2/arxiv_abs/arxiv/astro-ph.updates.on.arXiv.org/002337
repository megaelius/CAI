Cosmological gravitational microlensing has been proven to be a powerful tool to constrain the
structure of multiply imaged quasars, especially the accretion disc and central supermassive
black-hole system. However, the derived constraints on models may be affected by large systematic
errors introduced in the various stages of modelling, namely, the macromodels, the microlensing
magnification maps, and the convolution with realistic disc profiles. In particular, it has been
known that different macromodels of the galaxy lens that fit the observations equally well, can
lead to different values of convergence, $\kappa$, and shear, $\gamma$, required to generate magnification
maps. So far, 25 microlensed quasars have been studied using microlensing techniques, where each
system has been modelled and analyzed individually, or in small samples. This is about to change
due to the upcoming synoptic all-sky surveys, which are expected to discover thousands of quasars
suitable for microlensing studies. In the present study we investigate the connection between
macromodels of the galaxy lens and microlensing magnification maps throughout the parameter space
in preparation for future studies of large statistical samples of systems displaying microlensing.
In particular, we use 55,900 maps produced by the GERLUMPH parameter survey (available online at
this http URL ) and identify regions of parameter space where macromodel uncertainties ($\Delta\kappa$,$\Delta\gamma$)
lead to statistically different magnification maps. Strategies for mitigating the effect of $\Delta\kappa$,$\Delta\gamma$
uncertainties are discussed in order to understand and control this potential source of systematic
errors in accretion disc constraints derived from microlensing.
