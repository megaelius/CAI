We present neutral hydrogen (HI) observations using the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT)
of 70 optically-detected UDG candidates in the Coma region from the Systematically Measuring Ultra-Diffuse
Galaxies survey (SMUDGes). We detect HI in 18 targets, confirming 9 to be gas-rich UDGs and the remainder
to be foreground dwarfs. None of our HI-detected UDGs are Coma Cluster members and all but one are
in low-density environments. In our deep SMUDGes imaging, the HI-detected UDGs are bluer and have
more irregular morphologies than the redder, smoother candidates not detected in HI, with the combination
of optical color and morphology being a better predictor of gas richness than either parameter alone.
There is little visual difference between the gas-rich UDGs and the foreground dwarfs in the SMUDGes
imaging, and distances are needed to distinguish between them. We find that the gas richnesses $(M_{HI}/M_{*})$
of our UDGs scale with their effective radii ($R_{eff}$) in two stellar mass bins, consistent with
predictions from star formation feedback models of UDG formation. When optical inclinations are
used to estimate rotation velocities ($V_{rot}$) from measured HI linewidths, 7/9 of our UDGs deviate
from the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR). However, small changes in projected disk geometry
plausibly explained by the application of smooth photometric models to clumpy objects reconcile
our UDGs with the BTFR. These observations are a pilot for a large campaign now underway at the GBT
to use the HI properties of gas-rich UDGs to quantitatively constrain how these galaxies form and
evolve.
