Ultraviolet over-ionisation of iron atoms in the solar atmosphere leads to deviations in their
level populations from the Saha-Boltzmann statistics. This causes their line profiles to form
in Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) conditions. While inverting such profiles to determine
atmospheric parameters, the NLTE effects are often neglected and deviations from LTE are compensated
for by tweaking other quantities. We investigate how the routinely employed LTE inversion of iron
lines formed in NLTE under- or over-estimates atmospheric quantities such as temperature (T),
line-of-sight velocity (v_LOS), magnetic field strength (B) and inclination (gamma). Previous
papers have focused mainly on T. We synthesize the Stokes profiles of Fe I 6301.5 A and 6302.5 A lines
in both LTE and NLTE using a snapshot of a 3D MHD simulation. The profiles are then inverted in LTE.
By considering the atmosphere inferred from inversion of LTE profiles to be the fiducial model,
we compare atmosphere from the inversion of NLTE profiles with it. Any differences observed are
attributed to NLTE effects. Neglecting the NLTE effects introduces errors in the inverted atmosphere.
While the errors in T can go up to 13%, in v_LOS and B the errors can be as high as 50% or more. We find these
errors to be present at all three inversion nodes. Importantly, they survive degradation from spatial
averaging of the profiles. We give an overview of how the neglect of NLTE effects influences the values
of T, v_LOS, B and gamma determined by inverting Fe I 6300 A line pair, as observed, e.g., by Hinode.
Errors are found at the sites of granules, intergranular lanes, magnetic elements, basically in
every region susceptible to NLTE effects. For an accurate determination of atmospheric quantities
and their stratification, it is therefore important to take account of NLTE effects.
