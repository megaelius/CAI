This short note serves as an introduction to gravitational radiation through reviewing the inspiral-plunge
transition phase in extreme mass ratio binaries. We study the relativistic motion of a compact object
of mass $m$ around a massive black hole of mass $M\gg m$. The Kerr-Newman metric, effective potential
for the general case of elliptical orbits, gravitational radiation, orbital energy and angular
momentum of a coalescing CO in Kerr spacetime and gravitational wave frequency and signal to noise
ratio are briefly reviewed. The main focus is on the transition from inspiral to plunge for a CO assuming
that a test particle approach is plausible in the regime $m\ll M$ without appealing to a perturbative
analysis. The effective potential is used to obtain the properties of the Innermost Stable Circular
Orbit (ISCO) near which the adiabatic inspiral phase ends abruptly and the CO enters the plunge phase.
For the transition phase, the effective potential is expanded in terms of parameters such as the
radial (coordinate) distance from the ISCO and the deviation of particle's angular momentum from
its value at the ISCO to obtain the equation of motion. The equations of motion, during the inspiral
and transition phases, are joined numerically and the gravitational wave frequency, number of
wave cycles and signal to noise ratio (SN) during the transition is obtained following Ori \& Thorne
(2000). We also briefly discuss the main results of the extension of this model to circular/inclined
as well as elliptical/inclined orbits. The limitations and inaccuracies of the current methods
used to approach this problem is discussed. A short introduction to the fundamental concepts of
General Relativity, in particular Einstein Field Equations is also provided in the Appendix.
