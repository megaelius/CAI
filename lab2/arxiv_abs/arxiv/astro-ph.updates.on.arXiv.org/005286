On the ground of the large number of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected with cosmological redshift,
we have introduced a new classification of GRBs in seven subclasses, all with binary progenitors
originating gravitational waves (GWs). Each binary is composed by a different combination of carbon-oxygen
cores (CO$_{\rm core}$), neutron stars (NSs), black holes (BHs) and white dwarfs (WDs). The long
bursts, traditionally assumed to originate from a single BH with an ultra-relativistic jetted
emission, not expected to emit GWs, have instead been subclassified as (I) X-ray flashes (XRFs),
(II) binary-driven hypernovae (BdHNe), and (III) BH-supernovae (BH-SNe). They are framed within
the induced gravitational collapse (IGC) paradigm with progenitor a tight binary composed of a
CO$_{\rm core}$ and a NS or BH companion. The supernova (SN) explosion of the CO$_{\rm core}$ triggers
a hypercritical accretion process onto the companion NS or BH. If the accretion is not sufficient
for the NS to reach its critical mass, an XRF occurs, while when the BH is already present or formed
by accretion, a BdHN occurs. When these binaries are not disrupted by the mass-loss process, XRFs
lead to NS-NS binaries and BdHNe lead to NS-BH ones. The short bursts, originating in NS-NS mergers,
are subclassified as (IV) short gamma-ray flashes (S-GRFs) and (V) short GRBs (S-GRBs), the latter
when a BH is formed. Two additional families are (VI) ultra-short GRBs (U-GRBs) and (VII) gamma-ray
flashes (GRFs), respectively formed in NS-BH and NS-WD mergers. We use the occurrence rate of these
subclasses and their GW emission to assess their detectability by Advanced LIGO and Virgo, eLISA,
and resonant bars. We also discuss the consequences of our results in view of the recent announcement
of the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration of the source GW 170817 as being originated by a NS-NS merger.
