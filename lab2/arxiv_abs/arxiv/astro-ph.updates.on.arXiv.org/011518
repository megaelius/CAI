We present MUSE Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations of five individual HII regions in two giant
(>100 pc in radius) star-forming complexes in the low-metallicity ($Z$~0.33 $Z_{\odot}$) nearby
(D ~ 2 Mpc) dwarf spiral galaxy NGC 300. We combine the IFU data with high spatial resolution HST photometry
to demonstrate the extraction of stellar spectra and the classification of individual stars from
ground-based data at the distance of 2 Mpc. For the two star-forming complexes, in which no O-type
stars had previously been identified, we find a total of 13 newly identified O-type stars in the mass
range 15-50 M$_{\odot}$, as well as 4 Wolf-Rayet stars. We use the derived massive stellar content
to analyze the impact of stellar feedback on the HII regions. As already found for HII regions in the
Magellanic Clouds, the dynamics of the analyzed NGC 300 HII regions are dominated by a combination
of the pressure of the ionized gas and stellar winds. By comparing the derived ionized gas mass loading
factors to the total gas mass loading factor across the NGC 300 disk, we find that the latter is an order
of magnitude higher, either indicating very early evolutionary stages for these HII regions, or
being a direct result of the multi-phase nature of feedback-driven bubbles. Moreover, we analyze
the relation between the star formation rate and the pressure of the ionized gas as derived from small
(<100 pc) scales, as both quantities are systematically overestimated when derived on galactic
scales. With the wealth of ongoing and upcoming IFU instruments and programs, this study serves
as a pathfinder for the systematic investigation of resolved stellar feedback in nearby galaxies,
and it delivers the necessary analysis tools to enable massive stellar content and feedback studies
sampling an unprecedented range of HII region properties across entire galaxies in the nearby Universe.
