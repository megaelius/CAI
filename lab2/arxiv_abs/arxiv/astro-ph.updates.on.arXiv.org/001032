Numerical 3D radiative (M)HD simulations of solar convection are used to understand the physical
properties of the solar photosphere. To validate this approach, it is important to check that no
excessive thermodynamic fluctuations arise as a consequence of the partially incomplete treatment
of radiative transfer. We investigate the realism of 3D convection simulations carried out with
the Stagger code. We compared the characteristic properties of several spectral lines in solar
disc centre observations with spectra synthesized from the simulations. We degraded the synthetic
spectra to the spatial resolution of the observations using the continuum intensity distribution.
We estimated the necessary spectral degradation by comparing atlas spectra with averaged observed
spectra. In addition to deriving a set of line parameters directly, we used the SIR code to invert
the spectra. Most of the line parameters from the observational data are matched well by the degraded
simulation spectra. The inversions predict a macroturbulent velocity below 10 m/s for the simulation
at full spatial resolution, whereas they yield ~< 1000 m/s at a spatial resolution of 0.3". The
temperature fluctuations in the inversion of the degraded simulation do not exceed those from the
observational data (of the order of 100-200 K rms for -2<log tau<-0.5). The comparison of
line parameters in spatially averaged profiles with the averaged values of line parameters in spatially
resolved profiles indicates a significant change of (average) line properties at a spatial scale
between 0.13" and 0.3". Up to a spatial resolution of 0.3", we find no indications of the presence
of excessive thermodynamic fluctuations in the 3D HD simulation. To definitely confirm that simulations
without spatial degradation contain fully realistic thermodynamic fluctuations requires observations
at even better spatial resolution.
