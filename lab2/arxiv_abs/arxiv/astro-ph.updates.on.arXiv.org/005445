We present deep high resolution (0.03", 200pc) ALMA Band 7 observations covering the dust continuum
and [CII] $\lambda157.7\mu$m emission in four $z\sim4.4-4.8$ sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs)
selected from the ALESS and AS2UDS surveys. The data show that the rest-frame 160$\mu$m (observed
345 GHz) dust emission is consistent with smooth morphologies on kpc scales for three of the sources.
One source, UDS47.0, displays apparent substructure but this is also consistent with a smooth morphology,
as indicated by simulations showing that smooth exponential disks can appear clumpy when observed
at high angular resolution (0.03") and depth of these observations ($\sigma_{345\text{GHz}}
\sim27-47\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$). The four SMGs are bright [CII] emitters, and we extract [CII] spectra
from the high resolution data, and recover $\sim20-100$% of the [CII] flux and $\sim40-80$% of the
dust continuum emission, compared to the previous lower resolution observations. When tapered
to 0.2" resolution our maps recover $\sim80-100$% of the continuum emission, indicating that $\sim60$%
of the emission is resolved out on $\sim200$pc scales. We find that the [CII] emission in high-redshift
galaxies is more spatially extended than the rest-frame 160$\mu$m dust continuum by a factor of
$1.6\pm0.4$. By considering the $L_{\text{[CII]}}$/$L_{\text{FIR}}$ ratio as a function of
the star-formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\text{SFR}}$) we revisit the [CII] deficit,
and suggest that the decline in the $L_{\text{[CII]}}$/$L_{\text{FIR}}$ ratio as a function of
$\Sigma_{\text{SFR}}$ is consistent with local processes. We also explore the physical drivers
that may be responsible for these trends and can give rise to the properties found in the densest regions
of SMGs.
