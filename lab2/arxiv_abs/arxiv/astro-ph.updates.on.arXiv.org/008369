Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars span a wide range of stellar populations, from bona fide
second-generation stars to later forming stars that provide excellent probes of, e.g., binary
mass transfer. Here we analyse 11 metal-poor stars of which 10 are CEMP stars. Based on high signal-to-noise
(SNR) X-Shooter spectra, we derive abundances of 20 elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe,
Ni, Sr, Y, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Eu). From the high SNR spectra, we trace the chemical contribution of
the rare earth elements (REE) from various production sites, finding a preference for metal-poor
low-mass AGB stars of 1.5Mo in CEMP-s stars, while CEMP-r/s stars may indicate a more massive AGB
contribution (2-5Mo). A contribution from the r-process - possibly from neutron star mergers (NSM),
is also detectable in the REE abundances, especially in the CEMP-r/s. Combining spectra with Gaia
DR2 astrometric data indicates that all but one star in our sample (and most literature stars) belong
to the Galactic halo. They exhibit a median orbital eccentricity of 0.7, and are found on both pro-
and retrograde orbits. The orbital parameters of CEMP-no and CEMP4s stars are remarkably similar
in the 98 stars we study. A special CEMP-no star, with very low Sr and Ba content, possesses the most
eccentric orbit among the stars in our sample, passing close to the Galactic centre. Finally, we
propose an improved scheme to sub-classify the CEMP stars, making use of the Sr$/$Ba ratio, which
can also be used to separate very metal-poor stars from CEMP stars in 93 stars in the metallicity range
$-4.2<$[Fe/H]$<-2$. The Sr/Ba ratio can also be used for distinguishing CEMP-s,-r/s and -no stars.
The Sr/Ba ratio is also a powerful astro-nuclear indicator, as AGB stars exhibit very different
Sr/Ba ratios, compared to fast rotating massive stars and NSM, and it is fairly unbiased by NLTE and
3D corrections.(abridged)
