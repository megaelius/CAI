We analyze the accuracy of the variational method in computing physical quantities relevant for
gravitationally bound Bose-Einstein condensates. Using a variety of variational ans\"atze found
in existing literature, we determine physical quantities and compare them to exact numerical solutions.
We conclude that a "linear+exponential" wavefunction proportional to $(1 + \xi)\exp(-\xi)$ (where
$\xi$ is a dimensionless radial variable) is the best fit for attractive self-interactions along
the stable branch of solutions, while for small particle number $N$ it is also the best fit for repulsive
self-interactions. For attractive self-interactions along the unstable branch, a single exponential
is the best fit for small $N$, while a sech wavefunction fits better for large $N$. The Gaussian wavefunction
ansatz, which is used often in the literature, is exceedingly poor across most of the parameter space,
with the exception of repulsive interactions for large $N$. We investigate a "double exponential"
ansatz with a free constant parameter, which is computationally efficient and can be optimized
to fit the exact solutions in different limits. We show that the double exponential can be tuned to
fit the sech ansatz, which is computationally slow. We also show how to generalize the addition of
free parameters in order to create more computationally efficient ans\"atze using the double exponential.
Determining the best ansatz, according to several comparison parameters, will be important for
analytic descriptions of dynamical systems. Finally, we examine the underlying relativistic
theory, and critically analyze the Thomas-Fermi approximation often used in the literature.
