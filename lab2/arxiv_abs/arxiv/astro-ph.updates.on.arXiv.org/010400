We present a new and independent determination of the local value of the Hubble constant based on
a calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) applied to Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa). We find
a value of Ho = 69.8 +/- 0.8 (+/-1.1\% stat) +/- 1.7 (+/-2.4\% sys) km/sec/Mpc. The TRGB method is both
precise and accurate, and is parallel to, but independent of the Cepheid distance scale. Our value
sits midway in the range defined by the current Hubble tension. It agrees at the 1.2-sigma level with
that of the Planck 2018 estimate, and at the 1.7-sigma level with the SHoES measurement of Ho based
on the Cepheid distance scale. The TRGB distances have been measured using deep Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) imaging of galaxy halos. The zero point of the TRGB calibration
is set with a distance modulus to the Large Magellanic Cloud of 18.477 +/- 0.004 (stat) +/-0.020 (sys)
mag, based on measurement of 20 late-type detached eclipsing binary (DEB) stars, combined with
an HST parallax calibration of a 3.6 micron Cepheid Leavitt law based on Spitzer observations. We
anchor the TRGB distances to galaxies that extend our measurement into the Hubble flow using the
recently completed Carnegie Supernova Project I sample containing about 100 well-observed SNeIa.
There are several advantages of halo TRGB distance measurements relative to Cepheid variables:
these include low halo reddening, minimal effects of crowding or blending of the photometry, only
a shallow (calibrated) sensitivity to metallicity in the I-band, and no need for multiple epochs
of observations or concerns of different slopes with period. In addition, the host masses of our
TRGB host-galaxy sample are higher on average than the Cepheid sample, better matching the range
of host-galaxy masses in the CSP distant sample, and reducing potential systematic effects in the
SNeIa measurements.
