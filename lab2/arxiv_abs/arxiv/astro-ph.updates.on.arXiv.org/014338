It is a widespread opinion that hydrogen reionization is mainly driven by primeval star-forming
galaxies, with a minor role of high-z active galactic nuclei. Recent observations, however, challenge
this notion, indicating a number of issues related to a galaxy-driven reionization scenario. We
provide here an updated assessment of the space density of relatively faint (M1450~-22.5) AGNs
at zspec~5.5 in order to improve the estimate of the photo-ionization rate contribution from accreting
super massive black holes. Exploiting deep UV rest-frame ground-based spectra collected at the
Very Large Telescope on the CANDELS/GOODS-South field and deep Chandra X-ray images in the CANDELS/GOODS-North
and EGS areas, we find two relatively bright (M1450~-22.5) AGNs at zspec~5.5. We derive an AGN space
density of Phi=1.29x10^-6 cMpc^-3 at z~5.5 and M1450~-22.5 by simply dividing their observed number
by the cosmological volume in the range 5.0<z<6.1. Our estimate does not consider corrections for
incompleteness, therefore it represents a lower limit, although uncertainties due to cosmic variance
can still be significant. This value supports a high space density of AGNs at z>5, in contrast with
previous claims mostly based on standard color selection, possibly affected by significant incompleteness.
Our estimate for the AGN photo-ionization rate at z~5.5 is in agreement with the observed values
at similar redshifts, which are needed to keep the intergalactic medium highly ionized. Upcoming
JWST and giant ground based telescopes observations will improve the study of high-z AGNs and their
contribution to the reionization of the Universe.
