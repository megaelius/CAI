The meridional circulation of the Sun, which is observed to be poleward at the surface, should have
a return flow at some depth. Since large-scale flows like the differential rotation and the meridional
circulation are driven by turbulent stresses in the convection zone, these flows are expected to
remain confined within this zone. Current observational (based on helioseismology) and theoretical
(based on dynamo theory) evidences point towards an equatorward return flow of the meridional circulation
at the bottom of the convection zone. Assuming the mean values of various quantities averaged over
turbulence to be axisymmetric, we study the large-scale flows in solar-like stars on the basis of
a 2D mean field theory. Turbulent stresses in a rotating star can transport angular momentum, setting
up a differential rotation. The meridional circulation arises from a slight imbalance between
two terms which try to drive it in opposite directions: a thermal wind term (arising out of the higher
efficiency of convective heat transport in the polar regions) and a centrifugal term (arising out
of the differential rotation). To make these terms comparable, the poles of the Sun should be slightly
hotter than the equator. We discuss the important role played by the meridional circulation in the
flux transport dynamo model. The poloidal field generated by the Babcock--Leighton process at
the surface is advected poleward, whereas the toroidal field produced at the bottom of the convection
zone is advected equatorward. The fluctuations in the meridional circulation (with coherence
time of about 30--40 yr) help in explaining many aspects of the irregularities in the solar cycle.
Finally, we discuss how the Lorentz force of the dynamo-generated magnetic field can cause periodic
variations in the large-scale flows with the solar cycle.
