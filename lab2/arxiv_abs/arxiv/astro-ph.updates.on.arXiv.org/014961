[Abridged] We introduce an improved version of the Eccentric, Non-spinning, Inspiral-Gaussian-process
Merger Approximant (ENIGMA) waveform model. We find that this ready-to-use model can: (i) produce
physically consistent signals when sampling over 1M samples chosen over the $m_{\{1,\,2\}}\in[5M_{\odot},\,50M_{\odot}]$
parameter space, and the entire range of binary inclination angles; (ii) produce waveforms within
0.04 seconds from an initial gravitational wave frequency $f_{\textrm{GW}} =15\,\textrm{Hz}$
and at a sample rate of 8192 Hz; and (iii) reproduce the physics of quasi-circular mergers. We utilize
ENIGMA to compute the expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distributions of eccentric binary
black hole mergers assuming the existence of second and third generation gravitational wave detector
networks that include the twin LIGO detectors, Virgo, KAGRA, LIGO-India, a LIGO-type detector
in Australia, Cosmic Explorer, and the Einstein Telescope. In the context of advanced LIGO-type
detectors, we find that the SNR of eccentric mergers is always larger than quasi-circular mergers
for systems with $e_0\leq0.4$ at $f_{\textrm{GW}} =10\,\textrm{Hz}$, even if the timespan of
eccentric signals is just a third of quasi-circular systems with identical total mass and mass-ratio.
For Cosmic Explorer-type detector networks, we find that eccentric mergers have similar SNRs than
quasi-circular systems for $e_0\leq0.3$ at $f_{\textrm{GW}} =10\,\textrm{Hz}$. Systems with
$e_0\sim0.5$ at $f_{\textrm{GW}} =10\,\textrm{Hz}$ have SNRs that range between 50%-90% of the
SNR produced by quasi-circular mergers, even if these eccentric signals are just between a third
to a tenth the length of quasi-circular systems. For Einstein Telescope-type detectors, we find
that eccentric mergers have similar SNRs than quasi-circular systems for $e_0\leq0.4$ at $f_{\textrm{GW}}
=5\,\textrm{Hz}$.
