We present photometric analysis of twelve Galactic open clusters and show that the same multiple-population
phenomenon observed in Magellanic Clouds (MCs) is present in nearby open clusters. Nearly all the
clusters younger than $\sim$2.5 Gyr of both MCs exhibit extended main-sequence turnoffs (eMSTOs)
and all the cluster younger than $\sim$700 Myr show broadened/split main sequences (MSs). High-resolution
spectroscopy has revealed that these clusters host stars with a large spread in the observed projected
rotations. In addition to rotation, internal age variation is indicated as a possible responsible
for the eMSTOs, making these systems the possible young counterparts of globular clusters with
multiple populations. Recent work has shown that the eMSTO+broadened MSs are not a peculiarity
of MCs clusters. Similar photometric features have been discovered in a few Galactic open clusters,
challenging the idea that the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of these systems are similar to single
isochrones and opening new windows to explore the eMSTO phenomenon. We exploit photometry+proper
motions from Gaia DR2 to investigate the CMDs of open clusters younger than $\sim$1.5 Gyr. Our analysis
suggests that: (i) twelve open clusters show eMSTOs and/or broadened MSs, that cannot be due neither
to field contamination, nor binaries; (ii) split/broadened MSs are observed in clusters younger
than $\sim$700 Myr, while older objects display only an eMSTO, similarly to MCs clusters; (iii)
the eMSTO, if interpreted as a pure age spread, increases with age, following the relation observed
in MCs clusters and demonstrating that rotation is the responsible for this phenomenon.
