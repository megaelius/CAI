We describe charge-neutral neutron star matter in $\beta-$equilibrium using hybrid equations
of state, where a first-order phase transition from hadronic to quark matter is realized. The hadronic
matter is described in a model-independent way by a Taylor expansion around saturation density
$n_0$, while the three-flavor NJL model is used for the quark matter. Exploring the present uncertainty
on the empirical parameters of nuclear matter and the parameter space of the NJL model, we construct
two datasets of thermodynamically consistent and causal hybrid EoSs, compatible with astrophysical
observations. We conclude that, to sustain a considerable quark core size, the intensity of the
phase transition from hadron to quark matter cannot be strong, having a energy density gap below
$200$ MeV/fm$^3$, and must occur at baryon densities not above four times the saturation density.
A non zero but not too strong quark vector-isoscalar term and a weak vector isovector quark term are
required. Large quark cores carrying almost half of the star mass are possible inside neutron stars
with a maximum mass $\approx 2.2 M_\odot$. To get a considerable number of hybrid EoS predicting
quark matter already inside neutron stars with a mass $\sim 1.4 M_\odot$, we require that the onset
of quarks occurs in the range $1.3n_0$ and $2.5n_0$. Neutron stars with large quark cores corresponding
to more than one fourth of the total star mass, are possible if the energy density gap and the pressure
at transition are below 100 MeV/fm$^3$. However, under these constraints, the maximum neutron
star mass is limited to $ \lesssim 2.06 M_{\odot}$. No strong signatures from quark matter were found
on the radius and the tidal deformability for neutron star masses below $1.8\, M_\odot$.
