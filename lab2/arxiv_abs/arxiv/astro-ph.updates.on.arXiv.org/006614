We present measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing potential using the final
$\textit{Planck}$ 2018 temperature and polarization data. We increase the significance of the
detection of lensing in the polarization maps from $5\,\sigma$ to $9\,\sigma$. Combined with temperature,
lensing is detected at $40\,\sigma$. We present an extensive set of tests of the robustness of the
lensing-potential power spectrum, and construct a minimum-variance estimator likelihood over
lensing multipoles $8 \le L \le 400$. We find good consistency between lensing constraints and the
results from the $\textit{Planck}$ CMB power spectra within the $\rm{\Lambda CDM}$ model. Combined
with baryon density and other weak priors, the lensing analysis alone constrains $\sigma_8 \Omega_{\rm
m}^{0.25}=0.589\pm 0.020$ ($1\,\sigma$ errors). Also combining with baryon acoustic oscillation
(BAO) data, we find tight individual parameter constraints, $\sigma_8=0.811\pm0.019$, $H_0=67.9_{-1.3}^{+1.2}\,\text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}\,\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$,
and $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.303^{+0.016}_{-0.018}$. Combining with $\textit{Planck}$ CMB power
spectrum data, we measure $\sigma_8$ to better than $1\,\%$ precision, finding $\sigma_8=0.811\pm
0.006$. We find consistency with the lensing results from the Dark Energy Survey, and give combined
lensing-only parameter constraints that are tighter than joint results using galaxy clustering.
Using $\textit{Planck}$ cosmic infrared background (CIB) maps we make a combined estimate of the
lensing potential over $60\,\%$ of the sky with considerably more small-scale signal. We demonstrate
delensing of the $\textit{Planck}$ power spectra, detecting a maximum removal of $40\,\%$ of the
lensing-induced power in all spectra. The improvement in the sharpening of the acoustic peaks by
including both CIB and the quadratic lensing reconstruction is detected at high significance (abridged).
