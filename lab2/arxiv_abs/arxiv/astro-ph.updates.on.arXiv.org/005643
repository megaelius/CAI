We present HST photometry of a selected sample of 50 long-period, low-extinction Milky Way Cepheids
measured on the same WFC3 F555W, F814W, and F160W-band photometric system as extragalactic Cepheids
in SN Ia hosts. These bright Cepheids were observed with the WFC3 spatial scanning mode in the optical
and near-infrared to mitigate saturation and reduce pixel-to-pixel calibration errors to reach
a mean photometric error of 5 millimags per observation. We use the new Gaia DR2 parallaxes and HST
photometry to simultaneously constrain the cosmic distance scale and to measure the DR2 parallax
zeropoint offset appropriate for Cepheids. We find a value for the zeropoint offset of -46 +/- 13
muas or +/- 6 muas for a fixed distance scale, higher than found from quasars, as expected, for these
brighter and redder sources. The precision of the distance scale from DR2 has been reduced by a factor
of 2.5 due to the need to independently determine the parallax offset. The best fit distance scale
is 1.006 +/- 0.033, relative to the scale from Riess et al 2016 with H0=73.24 km/s/Mpc used to predict
the parallaxes photometrically, and is inconsistent with the scale needed to match the Planck 2016
CMB data combined with LCDM at the 2.9 sigma confidence level (99.6%). At 96.5% confidence we find
that the formal DR2 errors may be underestimated as indicated. We identify additional error associated
with the use of augmented Cepheid samples utilizing ground-based photometry and discuss their
likely origins. Including the DR2 parallaxes with all prior distance ladder data raises the current
tension between the late and early Universe route to the Hubble constant to 3.8 sigma (99.99 %). With
the final expected precision from Gaia, the sample of 50 Cepheids with HST photometry will limit
to 0.5% the contribution of the first rung of the distance ladder to the uncertainty in the Hubble
constant.
