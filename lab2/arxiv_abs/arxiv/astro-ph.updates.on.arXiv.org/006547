The brightest 500$\,\mu$m source in the XMM field, HXMM01, is a rare merger of luminous starburst
galaxies at $z=2.3$ with a dust-obscured star-formation rate of 2,000$\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$.
Here we present high-resolution spectroscopic observations of HXMM01 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA). We detect line emission from ${\rm CO\,{\it J}=7\to6}$, [C I]$\,{{^3P_2}\to{^3P_1}}$,
and p-${\rm H_{2}O}\,{2_{11}}\to{2_{02}}$ and continuum emission at $230\,$GHz. At a spatial
resolution of 0.2" and a spectral resolution of 40$\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$, the source is resolved into
three distinct disks, which are spatially and dynamically associated within a projected radius
of 20\,kpc and a radial velocity range of 2,000$\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$. While all three lines show similar
kinematics, they trace clouds with different physical conditions in the interstellar medium (ISM)
due to different critical densities: while [C I] likely originates from the same ISM structures
revealed in low-$J$ CO, ${\rm CO\,{\it J}=7\to6}$ and H$_{2}$O trace the warm and densest clouds.
For two major disks, our Bayesian-based tilted-ring modeling of the ALMA spectral cubes shows almost
flat rotation curves peaking at $\sim500\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ at galactocentric distances between
$2-5\,$kpc. Each of them has a dynamical mass of $\sim10^{11}\,M_\odot$. The combination of the
dynamical masses and the archival ${\rm CO\,{\it J}=1\to0}$ data places strong upper limits on
the CO$\to$H$_2$ conversion factor of $\alpha_{\rm CO}\lesssim1.4-2.0\,{M_{\odot}}\,\rm
(K\,km\,s^{-1}\,pc^{2})^{-1}$. Such low $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ values are significantly below the
Galactic inner disk value of $4.3\,{M_{\odot}}\,\rm (K\,km\,s^{-1}\,pc^{2})^{-1}$ but are
consistent with those of local starbursts. The previously estimated gas depletion timescale of
$\sim200\,$Myr remains unchanged.
