We infer the mass distribution of neutron stars in binary systems using a flexible Gaussian mixture
model and use Bayesian model selection to explore evidence for multi-modality and a sharp cut-off
in the mass distribution. We find overwhelming evidence for a bimodal distribution, in agreement
with previous literature, and report for the first time positive evidence for a sharp cut-off at
a maximum neutron star mass. We measure the maximum mass to be $2.06M_\odot < m_\mathrm{max} < 2.24M_\odot$
(68\%), $2.0M_\odot < m_\mathrm{max}< 2.5M_\odot$ (90\%), where this constraint is robust against
the choice of model for the mass distribution and to removing the most extreme (highest mass) neutron
stars from the dataset. If this sharp cut-off is interpreted as the maximum stable neutron star mass
allowed by the equation of state of dense matter, our measurement puts tight constraints on the equation
of state. For a set of realistic equations of state that support $>2M_\odot$ neutron stars, our inference
of $m_\mathrm{max}$ is able to distinguish between models at odds ratios of up to $15:1$, whilst
under a flexible piecewise polytropic equation of state model our maximum mass measurement improves
constraints on the pressure at $3-7\times$ the nuclear saturation density by $\sim 35-50\%$ compared
to simply requiring $m_\mathrm{max} > 2M_\odot$. We obtain a lower bound on the maximum sound speed
attained inside the neutron star of $c_s^\mathrm{max} > 0.64c$ (99.8\%), ruling out $c_s^\mathrm{max}<c/\sqrt{3}$
at high significance. Our constraints on the equation of state strengthen the case for neutron star-neutron
star mergers as the primary source of short gamma-ray bursts.
