In this paper, we present a new calculation of composition-dependent radiative cooling and heating
curves of low-density gas, intended primarily for use in numerical simulations of galaxy formation
and evolution. These curves depend on only five parameters: temperature, density, redshift, [Fe/H],
and [Mg/Fe]. They are easily tabulated and can be efficiently interpolated during a simulation.
The ionization equilibrium of 14 key elements is determined for temperatures between 10K and 10^9K
and densities up to 100 amu/cm^3 taking into account collisional and radiative ionization, by the
cosmic UV background and an interstellar radiation field, and by charge-transfer reactions. These
elements, ranging from H to Ni, are the ones most abundantly produced and/or released by SNIa, SNII,
and intermediate-mass stars. Self-shielding of the gas at high densities by neutral Hydrogen is
taken into account in an approximate way by exponentially suppressing the H-ionizing part of the
cosmic UV background for HI densities above a threshold density of n_HI,crit=0.007 cm^-3. We discuss
how the ionization equilibrium, and the cooling and heating curves depend on the physical properties
of the gas. The main advantage of the work presented here is that, within the confines of a well-defined
chemical evolution model and adopting the ionization equilibrium approximation, it provides
accurate cooling and heating curves for a wide range of physical and chemical gas properties, including
the effects of self-shielding. The latter is key to resolving the formation of cold, neutral, high-density
clouds suitable for star formation in galaxy simulations.
