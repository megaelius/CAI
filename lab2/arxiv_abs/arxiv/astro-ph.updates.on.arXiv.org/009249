% context {Magnetic field vector measurements are always ambiguous, i.e., two or more field vectors
are solutions of the observed polarisation.} % aims {The aim of the present paper is to solve the ambiguity
by comparing the ambiguous field vectors obtained in the same prominence observed on two following
days. The effect of the solar rotation is to modify the scattering angle of the prominence radiation,
which modifies the symmetry of the ambiguous solutions. This method, which is a kind of tomography,
was successfully applied in the past to the average magnetic field vector of 20 prominences observed
at the Pic-du-Midi. The aim of the present paper is to apply this method to a prominence observed with
spatial resolution at the TH\'EMIS telescope (European site at Iza\~na, Tenerife Island).} % methods
{The magnetic field vector is measured by interpretation of the Hanle effect observed in the \ion{He}{i}
D$_3$ 5876 \AA\, line, within the horizontal field vector hypothesis for simplicity. The ambiguity
is first solved by comparing the two pairs of solutions obtained for a "big pixel" determined by averaging
the observed Stokes parameters in a large region at the prominence center. Then, each pixel is disambiguated
by selecting the closest solution in a propagation from the prominence center to the prominence
boundary.} % results {The results previously obtained on averaged prominences are all recovered:
Inverse Polarity, small angle of about $-21^{\circ}$ between the magnetic field vector and the
filament long axis, within the Inverse Polarity scheme. The magnetic field strength, of about 6
G, is found to slightly increase with height, as previously observed also. The new result is the observed
decreasing with height, of the absolute value of the angle between the magnetic field vector and
the filament long axis.}
