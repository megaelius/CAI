Fossil groups (FGs) are galaxy aggregates with an extended and luminous X-ray halo, which are dominated
by a very massive early-type galaxy and lack of L* objects. FGs are indeed characterized by a large
magnitude gap between their central and surrounding galaxies. This is explained by either speculating
that FGs are failed groups that formed without bright satellite galaxies and did not suffer any major
merger, or by suggesting that FGs are very old systems that had enough time to exhaust their bright
satellite galaxies through multiple major mergers. Since major mergers leave signatures in the
stellar populations of the resulting galaxy, we study the stellar population parameters of the
brightest central galaxies (BCGs) of FGs as a benchmark against which the formation and evolution
scenarios of FGs can be compared. We present long-slit spectroscopic observations along different
axes of NGC 6482 and NGC 7556, which are the BCGs of two nearby FGs. The measurements include spatially
resolved stellar kinematics and radial profiles of line-strength indices, which we converted
into stellar population parameters using single stellar-population models. NGC 6482 and NGC 7556
are very massive and large galaxies and host a centrally concentrated stellar population, which
is significantly younger and more metal rich than the rest of the galaxy. The age gradients of both
galaxies are somewhat larger than those of the other FG BCGs studied so far, whereas their metallicity
gradients are similarly negative and shallow. They have negligible gradients of alpha-element
abundance ratio. The measured metallicity gradients are less steep than those predicted for massive
galaxies that formed monolithically and evolved without experiencing any major merger. We conclude
that the observed FGs formed through major mergers rather than being failed groups that lacked bright
satellite galaxies from the beginning.
