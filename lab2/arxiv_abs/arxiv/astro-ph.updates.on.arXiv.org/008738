Superluminous supernova (SLSN) lightcurves exhibit a superior diversity compared to their regular
luminosity counterparts in terms of rise and decline timescales, peak luminosities and overall
shapes. It remains unclear whether this striking variety arises due to a dominant power input mechanism
involving many underlying parameters, or due to contributions by different progenitor channels.
In this work, we propose that a systematic quantitative study of SLSN lightcurve timescales and
shape properties, such as symmetry around peak luminosity, can be used to characterize these enthralling
stellar explosions. We find that applying clustering analysis on the properties of model SLSN lightcurves,
powered by either a magnetar spin-down or a supernova ejecta-circumstellar interaction mechanism,
can yield a distinction between the two, especially in terms of lightcurve symmetry. We show that
most events in the observed SLSN sample with well-constrained lightcurves and early detections
strongly associate with clusters dominated by circumstellar interaction models. Magnetar spin-down
models also show association at a lower degree but have difficulty in reproducing fast-evolving
and fully symmetric lightcurves. We believe this is due to the truncated nature of the circumstellar
interaction shock energy input as compared to decreasing but continuous power input sources like
magnetar spin-down and radioactive Ni-56 decay. Our study demonstrates the importance of clustering
analysis in characterizing SLSNe based on high-cadence photometric observations that will be
made available in the near future by surveys like LSST, ZTF and Pan-STARRS.
