In order to determine the causes of kinematic asymmetry in the H$\alpha$ gas in the SAMI Galaxy Survey
sample, we investigate the comparative influences of environment and intrinsic properties of
galaxies on perturbation. We use spatially resolved H$\alpha$ velocity fields from the SAMI Galaxy
Survey to quantify kinematic asymmetry ($\overline{v_{asym}}$) in nearby galaxies and environmental
and stellar mass data from the GAMA survey. {We find that local environment, measured as distance
to nearest neighbour, is inversely correlated with kinematic asymmetry for galaxies with $\mathrm{\log(M_*/M_\odot)}>10.0$,
but there is no significant correlation for galaxies with $\mathrm{\log(M_*/M_\odot)}<10.0$.
Moreover, low mass galaxies ($\mathrm{\log(M_*/M_\odot)}<9.0$) have greater kinematic asymmetry
at all separations, suggesting a different physical source of asymmetry is important in low mass
galaxies.} We propose that secular effects derived from gas fraction and gas mass may be the primary
causes of asymmetry in low mass galaxies. High gas fraction is linked to high $\frac{\sigma_{m}}{V}$
(where $\sigma_m$ is H$\alpha$ velocity dispersion and $V$ the rotation velocity), which is strongly
correlated with $\overline{v_{asym}}$, and galaxies with $\log(M_*/M_\odot)<9.0$ have offset
$\overline{\frac{\sigma_{m}}{V}}$ from the rest of the sample. Further, asymmetry as a fraction
of dispersion decreases for galaxies with $\log(M_*/M_\odot)<9.0$. Gas mass and asymmetry are
also inversely correlated in our sample. We propose that low gas masses in dwarf galaxies may lead
to asymmetric distribution of gas clouds, leading to increased relative turbulence.
