The ratio between the CMB lensing/galaxy counts and the galaxy shear/galaxy counts cross-correlations
combines the information from different cosmological probes to infer cosmographic measurements
that are less dependent on astrophysical uncertainties and can constrain the geometry of the Universe.
We discuss the future perspectives for the measurement of this lensing ratio as previously introduced,
i.e. with the use of the Limber and flat-sky approximations and neglecting all the effects on the
galaxy survey from observing on the past lightcone. We then show how the cosmological information
in this estimator is affected by the Limber approximation and by the inclusion of the redshift space
distorsions (RSD) and magnification lensing contributions to the galaxy number counts. We find
that the magnification lensing contribution induces a multipole dependence of the lensing ratio
that we show to be detectable at a statistical significant level combining post-$Planck$ CMB surveys
and a Euclid-like experiment. We propose an improved estimator which takes into account this angular
scale dependence. Using this extended formalism, we present forecasts for upcoming and future
cosmological surveys and we show at which extent the lensing ratio information can improve the CMB
constraints on cosmological parameters. We get that for extended cosmological models where the
neutrino mass, the spatial curvature and the dark energy equation of state are allowed to vary, the
constraints from $Planck$ on these parameters and on $H_0$ can be reduced by $\sim 40\%$ with the
inclusion of a single lensing ratio and by $\sim 60-70\%$ adding the joint measurement of 9 lensing
ratios with a Euclid-like survey. We also find that neglegcting the contribution from magnification
lensing can induce a bias on the derived cosmological parameters in a combined analysis.
