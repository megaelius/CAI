Based on optical/near-IR Magellan FIRE spectra of 25 starburst galaxies at 0.5 < z < 0.9, Calabr\`o
et al.(2018) showed that their attenuation properties can be explained by a single-parameter sequence
of total obscurations ranging from A(V)=2 to A(V)=30 towards the starburst core centers in a mixed
stars and dust configuration. We investigate here the origin of this sequence for the same sample.
We show that total attenuations anti-correlate with the starburst sizes in radio (3 GHz) with a significance
larger than 5sigma and a scatter of 0.26 dex. More obscured and compact starbursts also show enhanced
N2 (=[NII]/Halpha) ratios and larger line velocity widths that we attribute to an increasing shock
contribution toward later merger phases, driven by deeper gravitational potential wells at the
coalescence. Additionally, the attenuation is also linked to the equivalent width (EW) of hydrogen
recombination lines, which is sensitive to the luminosity weighted age of the relatively unobscured
stellar populations. Overall, the correlations among A(V), radio size, line width, N2 and EW of
Balmer/Paschen lines converge towards suggesting an evolutionary sequence of merger stages:
all of these quantities are likely to be good time-tracers of the merger phenomenon, and their large
spanned range appears to be characteristic of the different merger phases. Half of our sample at
higher obscurations have radio sizes approximately 3 times smaller than early type galaxies at
the same redshift, suggesting that, in analogy with local Ultraluminous Infrared galaxies (ULIRGs),
these cores cannot be directly forming elliptical galaxies. Finally, we detect mid-IR AGN torus
for half of our sample and additional X-ray emission for 6 starbursts; intriguingly, the latter
have systematically more compact sizes, suggestive of emerging AGNs towards later merger stages,
possibly precursors of a later QSO phase.
