As a significant fraction of stars are in multiple systems, binaries play a crucial role in stellar
evolution. Among short-period (<1 day) binary characteristics, age remains one of the most difficult
to measure. In this paper, we constrain the lifetime of short-period binaries through their kinematics.
With the kinematic information from Gaia Data Release 2 and light curves from {\it Wide-field Infrared
Survey Explorer} (WISE), we investigate the eclipsing binary fraction as a function of kinematics
for a volume-limited main-sequence sample. We find that the eclipsing binary fraction peaks at
a tangential velocity of $10^{1.3-1.6}$ km/s, and decreases towards both low and high velocity
end. This implies that thick disk and halo stars have eclipsing binary fraction $\gtrsim 10$ times
smaller than the thin-disk stars. This is further supported by the dependence of eclipsing binary
fraction on the Galactic latitude. Using Galactic models, we show that our results are inconsistent
with any known dependence of binary fraction on metallicity. Instead, our best-fit models suggest
that the formation of these short-period binaries is delayed by 0.6-3 Gyr, and the disappearing
time is less than the age of the thick disk. The delayed formation time of $\gtrsim0.6$ Gyr implies
that these short-period main-sequence binaries cannot be formed by pre-main sequence interaction
and the Kozai-Lidov mechanism alone, and suggests that magnetic braking plays a key role in their
formation. Because the main-sequence lifetime of our sample is longer than 14 Gyr, if the disappearance
of short-period binaries in the old population is due to their finite lifetime, our results imply
that most ($\gtrsim90$%) short-period binaries in our sample merge during their main-sequence
stage.
