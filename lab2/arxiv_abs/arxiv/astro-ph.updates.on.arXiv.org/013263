We study the environments of a sample of 61 extremely rare z~1.6 Ultra-Massive Passively Evolving
Galaxies (UMPEGs: stellar masses M_stars >10^11.5 M_sun) which -- based on clustering analysis
presented in Cheema et al. (2020) -- appear to be associated with very massive (M_halo ~ 10^14.1 h^-1
M_sun) dark matter halos that are likely to be the progenitors of z~0 massive (Coma- and Virgo-like)
galaxy clusters. We find that UMPEGs on average have fewer than one satellite galaxy with mass ratio
M_sat : M_UMPEG >~ 1:5 (i.e., M_sat >~ 10^10.8 M_sun) within 0.5 Mpc; the large mass gap that we observe
between the typical UMPEG and its most massive satellite implies that the z~1.6 UMPEGs assembled
through major mergers. Using observed satellite counts with merger timescales from the literature,
we estimate the growth rate due to mergers with mass ratio of >~ 1:4 to be ~13% Gyr^-1 (with a ~2x systematic
uncertainty). This relatively low growth rate is unlikely to significantly affect the shape of
the massive end of the stellar mass function, whose evolution must instead be driven by the quenching
of new cohorts of ultra-massive star-forming galaxies. However, this growth rate is high enough
that, if sustained to z~0, the typical z~1.6 M_UMPEG=10^11.6 M_sun UMPEG can grow into a M_stars~10^12
M_sun brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) of a present-day massive galaxy cluster. Our observations
favour a scenario in which our UMPEGs are main-branch progenitors of some of the present-day BCGs
that have first assembled through major mergers at high redshifts and grown further through (likely
minor) merging at later times.
