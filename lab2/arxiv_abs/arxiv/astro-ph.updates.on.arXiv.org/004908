The effects of 'discreteness$'$ of a collisional star cluster of $N$-point stars may be conventionally
understood as close two-body encounters, statistical acceleration, and gravitational polarization.
However, if the system of concern is finite in size and density (not at the late stage of the evolution)
one must employ the fourth effect, self-consistent $'$truncated$'$ Newtonian mean field (m.f.)
potential $\Phi^{\triangle}$ $(r,t)=$ $\int_{\|r-r' \| > \triangle} \phi\left(r-r'\right)f\left(r',p',t\right)\text{d}^{3}{r'}\text{d}^{3}{p'}$.
The lower limit $\triangle$ represents the smallest space scale that statistical description
is applicable, corresponding to the Landau distance. The lower limit $\triangle$ represents the
smallest spatial scale on which statistical descriptions are applicable, corresponding to the
Landau distance. The truncated m.f. potential does not originate from the sparseness of stars in
phase space but is a necessary condition to separate the collision kinetic description (close encounters)
from the wave one (statistical acceleration). The present paper studies a formulation of mathematically
divergence-free kinetic equations based on the truncated m.f. potential at three level. (i) No
stars can come closer each other than the Landau distance. (ii) Only test star can come closer to one
field star than the Landau distance at a time while the other field stars can not. (iii) A convergent
kinetic theory for levels (i) and (ii) is formulated. Especially, the Kandrup's generalsied Landau
equation was extended by employing the Grad's truncated distribution function and Klimontovich's
theory of non-ideal systems. A correct relation is given between the strong two-body encounter
and m.f. potential.
