We introduce two new ways of obtaining the strength of plane-of-sky (POS) magnetic field by simultaneous
use of spectroscopic Doppler-shifted lines and the information on magnetic field direction. The
latter can be obtained either through polarization measurements or using the velocity gradient
technique. We show the advantages that our techniques have compared to the traditional Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi
(DCF) technique of estimating magnetic field strength from observations. The first technique
that we describe in detail employs structure functions of velocity centroids and structure functions
of Stokes parameters. We provide analytical expressions for obtaining magnetic field strength
from observational data. We successfully test our results using synthetic observations obtained
with results of MHD turbulence simulations. We measure velocity and magnetic field fluctuations
at small scales using two, three and four point structure functions and compare the performance
of these tools. We show that, unlike the DCF, our technique is capable of providing the detailed distribution
of POS magnetic field and it can measure magnetic field strength in the presence of both velocity
and magnetic field distortions arising from external shear and self-gravity. The second technique
applies the velocity gradient technique to velocity channel maps in order to obtain the Alfven Mach
number and uses the amplitudes of the gradients to obtain the sonic Mach number. The ratio of these
two Mach numbers provides the intensity of magnetic field in the region contributing to the emission
in the channel map. We test the technique and discuss obtaining the 3D distribution of POS galactic
Magnetic field with it. We discuss the application of the second technique to synchrotron data.
