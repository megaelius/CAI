The spatial clustering of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is considered to be one of the important
diagnostics for the understanding of the underlying processes behind their activities complementary
to measurements of the luminosity function (LF). We analyse the AGN clustering from a recent semi-analytic
model performed on a large cosmological $N$-body simulation covering a cubic gigaparsec comoving
volume. We have introduced a new time-scale of gas accretion on to the supermassive black holes to
account for the loss of the angular momentum on small scales, which is required to match the faint
end of the observed X-ray LF. The large simulation box allows us accurate determination of the auto-correlation
function of the AGNs. The model prediction indicates that this time-scale plays a significant role
in allowing massive haloes to host relatively faint population of AGNs, leading to a higher bias
factor for those AGNs. The model predictions are in agreement with observations of X-ray selected
AGNs in the luminosity range $10^{41.5}~\mathrm{erg} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1} \leq L_{2-10\mathrm{keV}}
\leq 10^{44.5}~\mathrm{erg} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, with the typical host halo mass of $10^{12.5-13.5}
h^{-1}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ at $z \lesssim 1$. This result shows that the observational clustering
measurements impose an independent constraint on the accretion time-scale complementary to the
LF measurements. Moreover, we find that not only the effective halo mass corresponding to the overall
bias factor, but the extended shape of the predicted AGN correlation function shows remarkable
agreement with those from observations. Further observational efforts towards the low luminosity
end at $z \sim 1$ would give us stronger constraints on the triggering mechanisms of AGN activities
through their clustering.
