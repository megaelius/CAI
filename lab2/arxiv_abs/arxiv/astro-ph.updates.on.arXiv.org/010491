We review the numerical techniques for ideal and non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) used in
the context of star formation simulations. We outline the specific challenges offered by modeling
star forming environments, which are dominated by supersonic and super-Alfvenic turbulence in
a radiative, self-gravitating fluid. These conditions are rather unique in physics and engineering
and pose particularly severe restrictions on the robustness and accuracy of numerical codes. One
striking aspect is the formation of collapsing fluid elements leading to the formation of singularities
that represent point-like objects, namely the proto-stars. Although a few studies have attempted
to resolve the formation of the first and second Larson cores, resolution limitations force us to
use sink particle techniques, with sub-grid models to compute the accretion rates of mass, momentum
and energy, as well as their ejection rate due to radiation and jets from the proto-stars. We discuss
the most popular discretisation techniques used in the community, namely smoothed particle hydrodynamics,
finite difference and finite volume methods, stressing the importance to maintain a divergence-free
magnetic field. We discuss how to estimate the truncation error of a given numerical scheme, and
its importance in setting the magnitude of the numerical diffusion. This can have a strong impact
on the outcome of these MHD simulations, where both viscosity and resistivity are implemented at
the grid scale. We then present various numerical techniques to model non-ideal MHD effects, such
as Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion, as well as the Hall effect. These important physical ingredients
are posing strong challenges in term of resolution and time stepping. For the latter, several strategies
are discussed to overcome the limitations due to prohibitively small time steps (abridged).
