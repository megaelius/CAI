An interplay of magnetic fields and gravitation drives accretion and outflows near black holes.
However, a specific mechanism is still a matter of debate; it is very likely that different processes
dominate under various conditions. In particular, for the acceleration of particles and their
collimation in jets, an ordered component of the magnetic field seems to be essential. Here we discuss
the role of large-scale magnetic fields in transporting the charged particles and dust grains from
the bound orbits in the equatorial plane of a rotating (Kerr) black hole and the resulting acceleration
along trajectories escaping the system in a direction parallel to the symmetry axis (perpendicular
to the accretion disk). We consider a specific scenario of destabilization of circular geodesics
of initially neutral matter by charging (e.g., due to photoionization). Some particles may be set
on escaping trajectories and attain relativistic velocity. The case of charged particles differs
from charged dust grains by their charge-to-mass ratio, but the acceleration mechanism operates
in a similar manner. It appears that the chaotic dynamics controls the outflow and supports the formation
of near-horizon escape zones. We employ the technique of recurrence plots to characterize the onset
of chaos in the outflowing medium. We investigate the system numerically and construct the basin-boundary
plots, which show the location and the extent of the escape zones. The effects of black hole spin and
magnetic field strength on the formation and location of escape zones are discussed, and the maximal
escape velocity is computed.
