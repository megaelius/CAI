We explore properties of barred active spiral galaxies in groups selected from the SDSS-DR7, with
the aim of assessing the effects of bars on AGN and the role of the high density environment. We identified
barred active galaxies that reside in groups from SDSS-DR7 group catalog. To provide a suitable
quantification of the effects of bars, a reliable control sample of unbarred active galaxies in
high density environments with similar redshift, magnitude, morphology, and bulge size distributions
was constructed. We found that the fraction of barred AGN galaxies in groups (~ 38 %) is higher than
those in the total barred AGN sample ( ~ 28 %), indicating that AGN spiral galaxies in groups are more
likely to be barred than those in the field. We also found that barred AGN galaxies are more concentrated
towards the group centers than the other unbarred AGN group members. In addition, barred AGN host
galaxies show an excess of population dominated by red colors suggesting that bars produce an importanteffect
on galaxy colors of AGN hosts. The host groups of the barred AGN exhibit a larger fraction of red colors
than the host groups of the corresponding unbarred active galaxies. Color-magnitude relations
of both host groups of AGN differ significantly: the host group colors of barred active galaxies
display distributions spreading toward red populations, with respect to the host groups of the
unbarred AGN objects. Barred active galaxies show an excess of nuclear activity compared to galaxies
without bars. We found that barred active galaxies located farther from the group-center have stronger
Lum[OIII]. Our findings suggest that the efficiency of bars to transport material towards the more
central regions of the AGN galaxies in high density environments reveals an important dependence
on the localization of objects within the group and on the host group colors.
