We present a detailed analysis of the influence of the environment and of the environmental history
on quenching star formation in central and satellite galaxies in the local Universe. We take advantage
of publicly available galaxy catalogues obtained from applying a galaxy formation model to the
Millennium simulation. In addition to halo mass, we consider the local density of galaxies within
various fixed scales. Comparing our model predictions to observational data (SDSS), we demonstrate
that the models are failing to reproduce the observed density dependence of the quiescent galaxy
fraction in several aspects: for most of the stellar mass ranges and densities explored, models
cannot reproduce the observed similar behaviour of centrals and satellites, they slightly under-estimate
the quiescent fraction of centrals and significantly over-estimate that of satellites. We show
that in the models, the density dependence of the quiescent central galaxies is caused by a fraction
of "backsplash" centrals which have been satellites in the past (and were thus suffering from environmental
processes). Turning to satellite galaxies, the density dependence of their quiescent fractions
reflects a dependence on the time spent orbiting within a parent halo of a particular mass, correlating
strongly with halo mass and distance from the halo centre. Comparisons with observational estimates
suggest relatively long gas consumption time scales of roughly 5 Gyr in low mass satellite galaxies.
The quenching time scales decrease with increasing satellite stellar mass. Overall, a change in
modelling both internal processes (star formation and feedback) and environmental processes
(e.g. making them dependent on dynamical friction time-scales and preventing the re-accretion
of gas onto backsplash galaxies) is required for improving currently used galaxy formation models.
