Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing is a powerful probe of the matter distribution in the
Universe. The standard quadratic estimator, which is typically used to measure the lensing signal,
is known to be suboptimal for low-noise polarization data from next-generation experiments. In
this paper we explain why the quadratic estimator will also be suboptimal for measuring lensing
on very small scales, even for measurements in temperature where this estimator typically performs
well. Though maximum likelihood methods could be implemented to improve performance, we explore
a much simpler solution, revisiting a previously proposed method to measure lensing which involves
a direct inversion of the background gradient. An important application of this simple formalism
is the measurement of cluster masses with CMB lensing. We find that directly applying a gradient
inversion matched filter to simulated lensed images of the CMB can tighten constraints on cluster
masses compared to the quadratic estimator. While the difference is not relevant for existing surveys,
for future surveys it can translate to significant improvements in mass calibration for distant
clusters, where galaxy lensing calibration is ineffective due to the lack of enough resolved background
galaxies. Improvements can be as large as $\sim 50\%$ for a cluster at $z = 2$ and a next-generation
CMB experiment with 1$\mu$K-arcmin noise, and over an order of magnitude for lower noise levels.
For future surveys, this simple matched-filter or gradient inversion method approaches the performance
of maximum likelihood methods, at a fraction of the computational cost.
