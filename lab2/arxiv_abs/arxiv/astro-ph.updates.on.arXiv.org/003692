Here we present an integral-field study of the massive, high-metallicity spiral NGC 3191, the host
of SN 2017egm, the closest SLSN Type I to date. We use data from PMAS/CAHA and the public MaNGA survey
to shed light on the properties of the SLSN site and the origin of star-formation in this non-starburst
spiral galaxy. We map the physical properties different \ion{H}{II} regions throughout the galaxy
and characterize their stellar populations using the STARLIGHT fitting code. Kinematical information
allows to study a possible interaction with its neighbouring galaxy as the origin of recent star
formation activity which could have caused the SLSN. NGC 3191 shows intense star-formation in the
western part with three large SF regions of low metallicity. The central regions of the host have
a higher metallicity, lower specific star-formation rate and lower ionization. Modeling the stellar
populations gives a different picture: The SLSN region has two dominant stellar populations with
different ages, the youngest one with an age of 2-10 Myr and lower metallicity, likely the population
from which the SN progenitor originated. Emission line kinematics of NGC 3191 show indications
of interaction with its neighbour MCG+08-19-017 at $\sim$45 kpc, which might be responsible for
the recent starburst. In fact, this galaxy pair has in total hosted 4 SNe, 1988B (Type Ia), SN 2003ds
(Type Ic in MCG+08-19-017), PTF10bgl (SLSN-Type II) and 2017egm, underlying the enhanced SF in
both galaxies due to interaction. Our study shows that one has to be careful interpreting global
host and even gas properties without looking at the stellar population history of the region. SLSNe
seem to still be consistent with massive stars ($>$ 20 M$_\odot$) requiring low ($< 0.6Z_{\odot}$)
metallicity and those environments can also occur in massive, late-type galaxies but not necessarily
starbursts.
