We use three semi-analytic models (SAMs) of galaxy formation and evolution run on the same $1 h^{-1}$Gpc
MultiDark Planck 2 cosmological simulation to investigate the properties of [OII] emission line
galaxies over the redshift range $0.6<z<1.2$. We compare model predictions with different observational
data sets, including DEEP2-Firefly galaxies with absolute magnitudes. We estimate the [OII] luminosity
(L[OII]) using a public code and simple relations derived both from the models and observations.
The public code ideally uses as input instantaneous star formation rates (SFRs), which are only
provided by one of the SAMs under study. We use this SAM to study the feasibility of inferring galaxies'
L[OII] for models that only provide SFRs averaged across full snapshot intervals. We find that the
L[OII] post-processing computation from average SFRs is accurate for model galaxies with log(L[OII]/$\rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$)$\lesssim42.5$
($<5$% discrepancy). We also explore how to derive the [OII] luminosity from simple relations using
the global properties that are usually output by SAMs. Besides the SFR, the model L[OII] is best correlated
with the observed-frame $u$ and $g$ broad-band magnitudes. These correlations have coefficients
(r-values) above 0.65 and a dispersion that varies with L[OII]. We use these correlations and an
observational one based on SFR and metallicity to derive L[OII]. Using these simple relations result
in [OII] luminosity functions with shapes that vary depending on both the model and the method used.
Nevertheless, for two of the three studied models, the amplitude of the clustering at scales above
$1h^{-1}$Mpc remains unchanged independently of the method used to derived the L[OII].
