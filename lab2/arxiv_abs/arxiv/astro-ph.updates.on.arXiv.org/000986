We present a new optical spectroscopic survey of 1777 'star-forming' ('SF') and 366 'non-star-forming'
('non-SF') galaxies at redshifts z < 1 (2143 in total), 22 AGN and 423 stars, observed by instruments
such as DEIMOS, VIMOS and GMOS, in 3 fields containing 5 quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) with HST UV
spectroscopy. We also present a new spectroscopic survey of 165 'strong' (10^14 < NHI < 10^17
cm^-2), and 489 'weak' (10^13 < NHI < 10^14 cm^-2) intervening HI absorption line systems
at z < 1 (654 in total), observed in the spectra of 8 QSOs by COS and FOS on the HST. Combining these
new data with previously published galaxy catalogs such as VVDS and GDDS, we have gathered a sample
of 654 HI absorption systems and 17509 galaxies at transverse scales < 50 Mpc. We present observational
results on the HI-galaxy and galaxy-galaxy correlations at transverse scales r < 10 Mpc, and
the HI-HI auto-correlation at transverse scales r < 2 Mpc. The two-point correlation functions
are measured both along and transverse to the line-of-sight. We constrain the HI-galaxy statistical
connection, as a function of both HI column density and galaxy star-forming activity. Our results
are consistent with the following conclusions: (1) the bulk of HI systems on Mpc scales have little
velocity dispersion (<120 km/s) with respect to the bulk of galaxies; (2) the vast majority of
strong HI systems and SF galaxies are distributed in the same locations, together with 75+-15% of
non-SF galaxies, all of which typically reside in dark matter haloes of similar masses; (3) 25+-15%
of non-SF galaxies reside in galaxy clusters and are not correlated with strong HI systems at scales
< 2 Mpc; and (4) 50% of weak HI systems reside within galaxy voids (hence not correlated with galaxies),
and are confined in dark matter haloes of masses smaller than those hosting... [abridged]
