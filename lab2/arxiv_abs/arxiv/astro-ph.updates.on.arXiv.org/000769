Context: Asteroseismic surface gravity values can be of importance in determining spectroscopic
stellar parameters. The independent log(g) value from asteroseismology can be used as a fixed value
in the spectroscopic analysis to reduce uncertainties due to the fact that log(g) and effective
temperature can not be determined independently from spectra. Since 2012, a combined analysis
of seismically and spectroscopically derived stellar properties is ongoing for a large survey
with SDSS/APOGEE and Kepler. Therefore, knowledge of any potential biases and uncertainties in
asteroseismic log(g) values is now becoming important. Aims: The seismic parameter needed to derive
log(g) is the frequency of maximum oscillation power (nu_max). Here, we investigate the influence
of nu_max derived with different methods on the derived log(g) values. The large frequency separation
between modes of the same degree and consecutive radial orders (Dnu) is often used as an additional
constraint for the determination of log(g). Additionally, we checked the influence of small corrections
applied to Dnu on the derived values of log(g). Methods We use methods extensively described in the
literature to determine nu_max and Dnu together with seismic scaling relations and grid-based
modeling to derive log(g). Results: We find that different approaches to derive oscillation parameters
give results for log(g) with small, but different, biases for red-clump and red-giant-branch stars.
These biases are well within the quoted uncertainties of ~0.01 dex (cgs). Corrections suggested
in the literature to the Dnu scaling relation have no significant effect on log(g). However somewhat
unexpectedly, method specific solar reference values induce biases of the order of the uncertainties,
which is not the case when canonical solar reference values are used.
