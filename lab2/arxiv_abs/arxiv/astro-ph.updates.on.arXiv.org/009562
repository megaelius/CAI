We study the imprints on the formation of cosmic structures of a particular class of dark energy parameterizations
dubbed PADE parameterization. Here we investigate how dark energy can affect the growth of large
scale structures of the universe in framework of spherical collapse model. The dynamics of the spherical
collapse of a dark matter halo depends on the properties of the dark energy model. We show that the
properties of spherical collapse scenario are directly affected by the evolution of dark energy.
We obtain the main parameters of spherical collapse for two different DE parameterizations in two
different approaches: first the homogeneous DE approach, in which dark energy does not exhibit
fluctuations on cluster scales and the other, clustered DE scenario in which, dark energy components
inside the overdense region collapses similar to dark matter. Using the Sheth-Tormen mass function,
we investigate the abundance of virialized halos in the framework of PADE parameterizations. Specifically,
the present analysis shows that the number count of dark matter halos depends on the evolution of
DE parameterizations and clustering properties of dark energy. Also we show that perturbations
in phantom DE components enhance the growth of matter perturbations. This result were obtained
in the literature for dark energy parameterizations that are phantom at all redshifts. But we obtained
same results for dark energy parameterizations which are in phantom regime and enter in quintessence
region at relatively low redshifts. We also show that in parameterizations under study, low mass
halos were formed before massive halos.
