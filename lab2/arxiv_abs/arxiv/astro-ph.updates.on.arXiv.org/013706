The vertical component of the magnetic field ($B_\perp$) was found to reach a constant value at the
umbra-penumbra boundary of stable sunspots in a recent statistical study of Hinode/SP data. The
objective of this work is to verify the existence of a constant value for $B_\perp$ at the umbra-penumbra
boundary from ground-based data in the near-infrared wavelengths and to determine its value for
GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS) data. This is the first statistical study on the Jurcak criterion
with ground-based data, and we compare it with the results from Hinode and HMI data. Eleven spectropolarimetric
data sets from the GRIS slit-spectograph containing stable sunspots were selected from the GRIS
archive (sdc.leibniz-kis.de). SIR inversions including a polarimetric straylight correction
are used to produce maps of the magnetic field vector using the Fe 1564.8 and 1566.2 nm lines. Averages
of $B_\perp$ along umbra-penumbra boundaries are analyzed for the 11 data sets. Geometric differences
between contours at the resulting $B_\perp^{\rm const}$ value and contours in intensity, $\Delta
P$, are calculated. Averaged over the 11 sunspots, we find a value of $B_\perp=1787\pm100$ gauss.
Contours at $B_\perp=B_\perp^{\rm const}$ and contours calculated in intensity maps match from
a visual inspection and the geometric distance $\Delta P$ was found to be on the order of 2 pixels.
Furthermore, the standard deviation between different data sets of averages along umbra--penumbra
contours is smaller for $B_\perp$ than for $B_\parallel$ by a factor of 2.4. Our results provide
further support to the Jurcak criterion with the existence of an invariable value $B_\perp^{\rm
const}$ at the umbra--penumbra boundary. We also found that the geometric difference, $\Delta
P$, between intensity contours and contours at $B_\perp=B_\perp^{\rm const}$ acts as an index
of stability for sunspots.
