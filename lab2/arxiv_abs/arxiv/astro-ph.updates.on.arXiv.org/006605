We present a 155ks NuSTAR observation of the $z\sim2$ hot dust-obscured galaxy (hot DOG) W1835+4355.
We extracted spectra from the two NuSTAR detectors and analyzed them jointly with the archival XMM
PN and MOS spectra. We performed a spectroscopic analysis based on both phenomenological and physically
motivated models employing toroidal and spherical geometry for the obscurer. In all the modelings,
the source exhibits a Compton-thick column density $N_{\rm H} \gtrsim 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, a 2-10
keV luminosity $L_{2-10}\approx2\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ , and a prominent soft excess ($\sim5-10$
% of the primary radiative output), which translates into a luminosity $\sim10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$.
We modeled the spectral energy distribution from 1.6 to 850 $\mu m$ using a clumpy two-phase dusty
torus model plus a modified blackbody to account for emission powered by star formation in the far-infrared.
We employed several geometrical configurations consistent with those applied in the X-ray analysis.
In all cases we obtained a bolometric luminosity $L_{\rm bol}\approx3-5\times10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$,
which confirms the hyperluminous nature of this active galactic nucleus. Finally, we estimate
a prodigious star formation rate of $\sim$3000 $M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$, which is consistent with
the rates inferred for $z\approx2-4$ hyperluminous type I quasars. The heavily obscured nature,
together with $L_{\rm bol}$, the ratio of X-ray to mid-infrared luminosity, the rest-frame optical
morphology, and the host star formation rate are indicative of its evolutionary stage. We can interpret
this as a late-stage merger event in the transitional, dust-enshrouded, evolutionary phase eventually
leading to an optically bright AGN.
