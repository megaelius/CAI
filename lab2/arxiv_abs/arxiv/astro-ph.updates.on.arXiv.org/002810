We study the magnetospheric activity in the polar cap region of pulsars under stellar oscillations.
The toroidal oscillation of the star propagates into the magnetosphere, which provides additional
voltage due to unipolar induction, changes Goldreich-Julian charge density from the traditional
value due to rotation, and hence, influences particle acceleration. We present a general solution
of the effect of oscillations within the framework of the inner vacuum gap model, and consider three
different inner gap modes controlled by curvature radiation, inverse Compton scattering, and
two photon annihilation, respectively. With different pulsar parameters and oscillation amplitudes,
one of three modes would play a dominant role in defining the gap properties. When the amplitude of
oscillation exceeds a critical value, mode changing would occur. Oscillations also lead to change
of the size of the polar cap. As applications, we show the inner gap properties under oscillations
in both normal pulsars and anomalous X-ray pulsars / soft gamma-ray repeaters (AXPs/SGRs). We interpret
the onset of radio emission after glitches/flares in AXPs/SGRs as due to oscilation-driven magnetic
activities in these objects, within the framework of both the magnetar model and the solid quark
star model. Within the magnetar model, radio activation may be caused by the enlargement of the effective
polar cap angle and the radio emission beam due to oscillation; whereas within the solid quark star
angle, it may be caused by activation of the pulsar inner gap from below the radio emission death line
due to an oscillation-induced voltage enhancement. The model can also explain the glitch-induced
radio profile change observed in PSR J1119-6127.
