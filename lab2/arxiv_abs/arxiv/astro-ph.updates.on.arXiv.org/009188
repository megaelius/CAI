As is well known, CME propagation often results in the fragmentation of the solar atmosphere on smaller
regions of density (magnetic field) enhancement (depletion). It is expected that this type of fragmentation
may have radio signatures. The general aim of the present paper is to perform a comparative analysis
of type III solar and narrow-band type-III-like radio burst properties before and during CME events,
respectively. The main goal is to analyze radio observational signatures of the dynamical processes
in solar corona. In particular, we aim to perform a comparison of local plasma parameters without
and with CME propagation, based on the analysis of decameter radio emission data. We performed a
comparison of usual type III bursts before the CME with narrow-band type-III-like bursts, which
are observationally detectable on top of the background type IV radio bursts associated with CME
propagation. We focused on the analysis of in total 429 type III and 129 narrow-band type-III-like
bursts. We studied their main characteristic parameters such as frequency drift rate, duration,
and instantaneous frequency bandwidth using standard statistical methods. Furthermore, we inferred
local plasma parameters using known definitions of frequency drift, duration, and instantaneous
frequency bandwidth.The analysis reveals that the physical parameters of coronal plasma before
CMEs considerably differ from those during the propagation of CMEs (the observational periods
2 and 4 with type IV radio bursts associated with CMEs). Local density radial profiles and the characteristic
spatial scales of radio emission sources vary with radial distance more drastically during the
CME propagation compared to the cases of quasistatic solar atmosphere without CME(s) (observational
periods 1 and 3). The results of the work enable us to distinguish different regimes of plasma state
in the solar corona.
