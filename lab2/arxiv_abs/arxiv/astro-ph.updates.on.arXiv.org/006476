Context: Redshifts are fundamental for our understanding of extragalactic X-ray sources. Ambiguous
counterpart associations, expensive optical spectroscopy and/or multimission multiwavelength
coverage to resolve degeneracies make estimation often difficult in practice. Aims: We attempt
to constrain redshifts of obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) using only low-resolution X-ray
spectra. Methods: Our XZ method fits AGN X-ray spectra with a moderately complex spectral model
incorporating a corona, torus obscurer and warm mirror. Using the Bayesian X-ray Astronomy (BXA)
package, we constrain redshift, column density, photon index and luminosity simultaneously.
The redshift information primarily comes from absorption edges in Compton-thin AGN, and from the
Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescent line in heavily obscured AGN. A new generic background fitting method
allows us to extract more information from limited numbers of source counts. Results: We derive
redshift constraints for 74/321 hard-band detected sources in the Chandra deep field South. Comparing
with spectroscopic redshifts, we find an outlier fraction of 8%, indicating that our model assumptions
are valid. For three Chandra deep fields, we release our XZ redshift estimates. Conclusions: The
independent XZ estimate is easy to apply and effective for a large fraction of obscured AGN in todays
deep surveys without the need for any additional data. Comparing to different redshift estimation
methods, XZ can resolve degeneracies in photometric redshifts, help to detect potential association
problems and confirm uncertain single-line spectroscopic redshifts. With high spectral resolution
and large collecting area, this technique will be highly effective for Athena/WFI observations.
