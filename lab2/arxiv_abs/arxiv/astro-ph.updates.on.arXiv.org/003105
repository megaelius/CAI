We study the properties of the dissipative accretion flow around rotating black holes in presence
of mass loss. We obtain the complete set of global inflow-outflow solutions in the steady state by
solving the underlying conservation equations self-consistently. We observe that global inflow-outflow
solutions are not the isolated solution, instead such solutions are possible for wide range of inflow
parameters. Accordingly, we identify the boundary of the parameter space for outflows, spanned
by the angular momentum ($\lambda_{\rm in}$) and the energy (${\cal E}_{\rm in}$) at the inner sonic
point ($x_{\rm in}$), as function of the dissipation parameters and find that parameter space gradually
shrinks with the increase of dissipation rates. Further, we examine the properties of the outflow
rate $R_{\dot m}$ (defined as the ratio of outflow to inflow mass flux) and ascertain that dissipative
processes play the decisive role in determining the outflow rates. We calculate the limits on the
maximum outflow rate ($R_{\dot{m}}^{\rm max}$) in terms of viscosity parameter ($\alpha$) as
well as black hole spin ($a_k$) and obtain the limiting range as $3\% \le R_{\dot{m}}^{\rm max} \le
19\%$. Moreover, we calculate the viable range of $\alpha$ that admits the coupled inflow-outflow
solutions and find that $\alpha \lesssim 0.25$ for $R_{\dot m} \ne 0$. Finally, we discuss the observational
implication of our formalism to infer the spin of the black holes. Towards this, considering the
highest observed QPO frequency of black hole source GRO J1655-40 ($\sim 450$ Hz), we constrain the
spin value of the source as $a_k \ge 0.57$.
