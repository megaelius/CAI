We present the results of a new Chandra study of the galaxy cluster A2626. The radio emission of the
cluster shows a complex system of four symmetric arcs without known correlations with the X-ray
emission. The mirror symmetry of the radio arcs toward the center and the presence of two optical
cores in the central galaxy suggested that they may be created by pairs of precessing radio jets powered
by dual AGNs inside the cD galaxy. However, previous observations failed to observe the second jetted
AGN and the spectral trend due to radiative age along the radio arcs, thus challenging this interpretation.
The new Chandra observation had several scientific objectives, including the search for the second
AGN that would support the jet precession model. We focus here on the detailed study of the local properties
of the thermal and non-thermal emission in the proximity of the radio arcs, in order to get more insights
into their origin. We performed a standard data reduction of the Chandra dataset deriving the radial
profiles of temperature, density, pressure and cooling time of the intra-cluster medium. We further
analyzed the 2D distribution of the gas temperature, discovering that the south-western junction
of the radio arcs surrounds the cool core of the cluster. We studied the X-ray SB and spectral profiles
across the junction, finding a cold front spatially coincident with the radio arcs. This may suggest
a connection between the sloshing of the thermal gas and the nature of the radio filaments, raising
new scenarios for their origin. A possibility is that the radio arcs trace the projection of a complex
surface connecting the sites where electrons are most efficiently reaccelerated by the turbulence
that is generated by the gas sloshing. In this case, diffuse emission embedded by the arcs and with
extremely steep spectrum should be most visible at very low radio frequencies.
