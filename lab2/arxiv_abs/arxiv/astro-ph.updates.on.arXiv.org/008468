Context. Colliding winds in massive binaries are able to accelerate particles up to relativistic
speeds as the result of the interaction between the winds of the different stellar components. HD
167971 exhibits this phenomenology which makes it a strong radio source. Aims. We aim at characterizing
the morphology of the radio emission and its dependence on the orbital motion, traced independently
by NIR-interferometry, of the spectroscopic binary and the tertiary component that conforms HD
167971. Methods. We analyze 2006 and 2016 very long baseline interferometric data at C and X bands.
We complement our analysis with a geometrical model of the wind-wind collision region, and with
an astrometric description of the system. Results. We confirm that the detected non-thermal radio
emission is associated with the wind-wind collision region of the spectroscopic binary and the
tertiary component in HD 167971. The wind-wind collision region changes orientation in agreement
with the orbital motion of the tertiary around the spectroscopic binary. The total intensity also
changes between the two observing epochs in a way inversely proportional to the separation between
the SB and T, with a negative-steep spectral index typical of an optically thin synchrotron emission
possibly steepened by an inverse Compton cooling effect. The wind-wind collision bow-shock shape
and its position with respect to the stars indicates that the wind momentum from the spectroscopic
binary is stronger than that of the tertiary. Finally, the astrometric solution derived for the
stellar system and the wind-wind collision region is consistent with independent Gaia data.
