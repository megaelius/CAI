We introduce the Disk Substructures at High Angular Resolution Project (DSHARP), one of the initial
Large Programs conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The primary
goal of DSHARP is to find and characterize substructures in the spatial distributions of solid particles
for a sample of 20 nearby protoplanetary disks, using very high resolution (0.035 arcsec, or 5 au
FWHM) observations of their 240 GHz (1.25 mm) continuum emission. These data provide a first homogeneous
look at the small-scale features in disks that are directly relevant to the planet formation process,
quantifying their prevalence, morphologies, spatial scales, spacings, symmetry, and amplitudes,
for targets with a variety of disk and stellar host properties. We find that these substructures
are ubiquitous in this sample of large, bright disks. They are most frequently manifested as concentric,
narrow emission rings and depleted gaps, although large-scale spiral patterns and small arc-shaped
azimuthal asymmetries are also present in some cases. These substructures are found at a wide range
of disk radii (from a few au to more than 100 au), are usually compact ($<$10 au), and show a wide range
of amplitudes (brightness contrasts). Here we discuss the motivation for the project, describe
the survey design and the sample properties, detail the observations and data calibration, highlight
some basic results, and provide a general overview of the key conclusions that are presented in more
detail in a series of accompanying articles. The DSHARP data -- including visibilities, images,
calibration scripts, and more -- are released for community use at https://almascience.org/alma-data/lp/DSHARP.
