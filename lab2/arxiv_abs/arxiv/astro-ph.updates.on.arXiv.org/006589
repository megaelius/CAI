The connection between stellar rotation, stellar activity, and convective turnover time is revisited
with a focus on the sole contribution of magnetic activity to the Ca II H&K emission, the so-called
excess flux, and its dimensionless indicator R$^{+}_{\rm{HK}}$ in relation to other stellar parameters
and activity indicators. Our study is based on a sample of 169 main-sequence stars with directly
measured Mount Wilson S-indices and rotation periods. The R$^{+}_{\rm{HK}}$ values are derived
from the respective S-indices and related to the rotation periods in various $B-V$-colour intervals.
First, we show that stars with vanishing magnetic activity, i.e. stars whose excess flux index R$^{+}_{\rm{HK}}$
approaches zero, have a well-defined, colour-dependent rotation period distribution; we also
show that this rotation period distribution applies to large samples of cool stars for which rotation
periods have recently become available. Second, we use empirical arguments to equate this rotation
period distribution with the global convective turnover time, which is an approach that allows
us to obtain clear relations between the magnetic activity related excess flux index R$^{+}_{\rm{HK}}$,
rotation periods, and Rossby numbers. Third, we show that the activity versus Rossby number relations
are very similar in the different activity indicators. As a consequence of our study, we emphasize
that our Rossby number based on the global convective turnover time approaches but does not exceed
unity even for entirely inactive stars. Furthermore, the rotation-activity relations might be
universal for different activity indicators once the proper scalings are used.
