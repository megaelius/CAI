It is now well established that the Alfv\'enic waves are ubiquitous in the solar corona. However,
the Alfv\'enic wave energy estimated from the Doppler velocity measurements in the corona was found
to be four orders of magnitude less than that estimated from non-thermal line widths. McIntosh &
De Pontieu (2012) suggested that this discrepancy in energy might be due to the line-of-sight (LOS)
superposition of the several oscillating structures, which can lead to an underestimation of the
Alfv\'enic wave amplitudes and energies. McIntosh & De Pontieu (2012) termed this coronal `dark'
or `hidden' energy. However, their simulations required the use of an additional, unknown source
of Alfv\'enic wave energy to provide agreement with measurements of the coronal non-thermal line
widths. In this study, we investigate the requirement of this unknown source of additional `dark'
energy in the solar corona using gravitationally stratified 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations
of propagating waves. We excite the transverse MHD waves and generate synthetic observations for
the Fe XIII emission line. We establish that the LOS superposition greatly reduces the Doppler velocity
amplitudes and increases the non-thermal line widths. Importantly, our model generates the observed
wedge-shaped correlation between Doppler velocities and non-thermal line widths. We find that
the observed wave energy is only 0.2-1\% of the true wave energy which explains 2-3 orders of magnitude
of the energy discrepancy. We conclusively establish that the true wave energies are hidden in the
non-thermal line widths. Hence, our results rule out the requirement for an additional `dark' energy
in the solar corona.
