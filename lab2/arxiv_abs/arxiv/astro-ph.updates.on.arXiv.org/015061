We use a statistical approach to study the evolution of the star-forming galaxy (SFG) main sequence
(MS) and the fraction of dust-obscured star formation up to $z\sim4$. We use the following observables:
the far-ultraviolet, FUV, and the infrared, IR, luminosity functions, LFs, and the galaxy stellar
mass function (GSMF) of SFGs. Our derived total (FUV+IR) star formation rates, SFR, reproduce the
evolution of the MS as compared to a set of independent observational inferences. At any redshift,
we find that the specific SFR$-M_{\ast}$ relation for MS SFGs approaches to a power law at the high-mass
end. At lower masses it bends and eventually the slope sign changes from negative to positive at very
low masses. At $z\sim0$, this change of sign is at $M_{\ast}\sim5\times10^{8} M_{\odot}$ close
to dust-obscured star formation regime, $M_{\ast}\sim6\times10^{8}M_{\odot}$. The slope sign
change is related to the knee of the FUV LF. We predict that the assembly time of nearby dwarf galaxies
is $\sim10$ Gyrs consistent with their oldest observed stellar populations. Our derived dust-obscured
fractions agree with previous determinations at $0\leq z\leq2.5$. The dust-obscured fraction
depends strongly on mass with almost no dependence with redshift above $z\sim1.2$. At $z\lesssim0.75$
high-mass galaxies become more ``transparent" compared to their high redshift counterparts.
On the opposite, low- and intermediate-mass galaxies have become more obscured by dust. Using the
joint evolution of the GSMF and the FUV and IR LFs is a promising empirical approach to study the stellar
mass growth and dust formation/destruction mechanisms, and ultimately to constrain galaxy formation
models.
