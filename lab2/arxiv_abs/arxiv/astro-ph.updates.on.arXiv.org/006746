Main sequence turnoff ages in young open clusters are complicated by turnoffs that are sparse, have
high binarity fractions, can be affected by differential reddening, and typically include a number
of peculiar stars. Furthermore, stellar rotation can have a significant effect on a star's photometry
and evolutionary timescale. In this paper we analyze in 12 nearby open clusters, ranging from ages
of 50 Myr to 350 Myr, how broadband UBV color-color relations can be used to identify turnoff stars
that are Be stars, blue stragglers, certain types of binaries, or those affected by differential
reddening. This UBV color-color analysis also directly measures a cluster's E(B-V) and estimates
its [Fe/H]. The turnoff stars unaffected by these peculiarities create a narrower and more clearly
defined cluster turnoff. Using four common isochronal models, two of which consider rotation,
we fit cluster parameters using these selected turnoff stars and the main sequence. Comparisons
of the photometrically fit cluster distances to those based on Gaia DR2 parallaxes find that they
are consistent for all clusters. For older (>100 Myr) clusters, like the Pleiades and the Hyades,
comparisons to ages based on the lithium depletion boundary method finds that these cleaned turnoff
ages agree to within ~10% for all four isochronal models. For younger clusters, however, only the
Geneva models that consider rotation fit turnoff ages consistent with lithium-based ages, while
the ages based on non-rotating isochrones quickly diverge to become 30% to 80% younger. This illustrates
the importance of rotation for deriving ages in the youngest (<100 Myr) clusters.
