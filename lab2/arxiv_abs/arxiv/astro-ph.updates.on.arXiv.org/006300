Star-forming galaxies at high redshift show anomalous values of infrared excess, which can be described
only by extremizing the existing relations between the shape of their ultraviolet continuum emission
and their infrared-to-ultraviolet luminosity ratio, or by constructing \textit{ad-hoc} models
of star formation and dust distribution. We present an alternative explanation, based on unveiled
AGN activity, to the existence of such galaxies. In fact, the presence of a weak AGN configures as
a natural scenario in order to explain the observed spectral properties of such high-$z$ objects
in terms of a continuum slope distribution rather than altered infrared excesses, due to the different
shape of the AGN continuum emission with respect to quiescent galaxies. To this aim, we directly
compare the infrared-to-ultraviolet properties of high-redshift galaxies to those of known categories
of AGN (quasars and Seyferts). We also infer the characteristics of their possible X-ray emission.
We find a strong similarity between the spectral shapes and luminosity ratios of AGN with the corresponding
properties of such galaxies. In addition, we derive expected X-ray fluxes that are compatible with
energetics from AGN activity. We conclude that a moderate AGN contribution to the UV emission of
such high-$z$ objects is a valid alternative to explain their spectral properties. Even the presence
of an active nucleus in each source would not violate the expected quasar statistics. Furthermore,
we suggest that the observed similarities between anomalous star-forming galaxies and quasars
may provide a benchmark for future theoretical and observational studies on the galaxy population
in the early Universe.
