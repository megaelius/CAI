We explore the characteristics of the cosmic web around Local Group(LG) like pairs using a cosmological
simulation in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We use the Hessian of the gravitational potential to
classify regions on scales of $\sim 2$ Mpc as a peak, sheet, filament or void. The sample of LG counterparts
is represented by two samples of halo pairs. The first is a general sample composed by pairs with similar
masses and isolation criteria as observed for the LG. The second is a subset with additional observed
kinematic constraints such as relative pair velocity and separation. We find that the pairs in the
LG sample with all constraints are: (i) Preferentially located in filaments and sheets, (ii) Located
in in a narrow range of local overdensity $0<\delta<2$, web ellipticity $0.1<e<1.0$
and prolateness $-0.4<p<0.4$. (iii) Strongly aligned with the cosmic web. The alignments
are such that the pair orbital angular momentum tends to be perpendicular to the smallest tidal eigenvector,
$\hat{e}_3$, which lies along the filament direction or the sheet plane. A stronger alignment is
present for the vector linking the two halos with the vector $\hat{e}_3$. Additionally, we fail
to find a strong correlation of the spin of each halo in the pair with the cosmic web. All these trends
are expected to a great extent from the selection on the LG total mass on the general sample. Applied
to the observed LG, there is a potential conflict between the alignments of the different planes
of satellites and the numerical evidence for satellite accretion along filaments; the direction
defined by $\hat{e}_3$. This highlights the relevance of achieving a precise characterization
of the place of the LG in the cosmic web in the cosmological context provided by $\Lambda$CDM.
