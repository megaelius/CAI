It is demonstrated that the Local Sheet is both geometrically and dynamically distinct from the
Local Supercluster and that the evolution of the Sheet and Local Group were probably interconnected.
The Sheet is inclined by 8 degrees with respect to the Local Supercluster, and the dispersion of giant
members about the mid-plane is only 230 kpc. A "Council of Giants" with a radius of 3.75 Mpc encompasses
the Local Group, demarcating a clear upper limit to the realm of influence of the Local Group. The
only two giant elliptical galaxies in the Sheet sit on opposite sides of the Council, raising the
possibility that they have somehow shepherded the evolution of the Local Group. The position vector
of the Andromeda galaxy with respect to the Milky Way deviates only 11 degrees from the Sheet plane
and only 11 degrees from the projected axis of the ellipticals. The Local Group appears to be moving
away from a ridge in the potential surface of the Council on a path parallel to the elliptical axis.
Spin directions of the giants in the Council are distributed over the sky in a pattern which is very
different from that of giants beyond, possibly in reaction to the central mass asymmetry that developed
into the Local Group. By matching matter densities of Group and Council giants, the edge of the volume
of space most likely to have contributed to the development of the Local Group is shown to be very close
to where gravitational forces from the Local Group and the Council balance. The boundary specification
reveals that the Local Sheet formed out of a density perturbation of very low amplitude (~10%), but
that normal matter was incorporated into galaxies with relatively high efficiency (~40%). It appears
that the development of the giants of the Local Sheet was guided by a pre-existing flattened framework
of matter.
