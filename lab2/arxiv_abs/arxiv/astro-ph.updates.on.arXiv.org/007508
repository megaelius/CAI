We investigate the role of hydrogen collisions in NLTE spectral line synthesis, and introduce a
new general empirical recipe to determine inelastic charge transfer (CT) and bound-bound hydrogen
collisional rates. This recipe is based on fitting the energy functional dependence of published
quantum collisional rate coefficients of several neutral elements (BeI, NaI, MgI, AlI, SiI and
CaI) using simple polynomial equations. We perform thorough NLTE abundance calculation tests
using our method for four different atoms, Na, Mg, Al and Si, for a broad range of stellar parameters.
We then compare the results to calculations computed using the published quantum rates for all the
corresponding elements. We also compare to results computed using excitation collisional rates
via the commonly used Drawin equation for different fudge factors, SH, applied. We demonstrate
that our proposed method is able to reproduce the NLTE abundance corrections performed with the
quantum rates for different spectral types and metallicities for representative NaI and AlI lines
to within $\le$0.05 dex and %\le%0.03 dex, respectively. For MgI and SiI lines, the method performs
better for the cool giants and dwarfs, while larger discrepancies up to 0.2 dex could be obtained
for some lines for the subgiants and warm dwarfs. We obtained larger NLTE correction differences
between models incorporating Drawin rates relative to the quantum models by up to 0.4 dex. These
discrepancies are potentially due to ignoring either or both CT and ionization collisional processes
by hydrogen in our Drawin models. Our empirical fitting method performs well in its ability to reproduce,
within narrow uncertainties, the abundance corrections computed with models incorporating quantum
collisional rates. It could possibly be extended to other transitions or in the absence of published
quantum calculations, to other elements as well.
