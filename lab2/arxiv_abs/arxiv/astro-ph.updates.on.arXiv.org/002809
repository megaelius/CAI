The aim of this paper is to find lost siblings of the Sun by analyzing high resolution spectra. Finding
solar siblings will enable us to constrain the parameters of the parental cluster and the birth place
of the Sun in the Galaxy. The solar siblings can be identified by accurate measurements of metallicity,
stellar age and elemental abundances for solar neighbourhood stars. The solar siblings candidates
were kinematically selected based on their proper motions, parallaxes and colours. Stellar parameters
were determined through a purely spectroscopic approach and partly physical method, respectively.
Comparing synthetic with observed spectra, elemental abundances were computed based on the stellar
parameters obtained using a partly physical method. A chemical tagging technique was used to identify
the solar siblings. We present stellar parameters, stellar ages, and detailed elemental abundances
for Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, and Ni for 32 solar sibling candidates. Our abundances analysis
shows that four stars are chemically homogenous together with the Sun. Technique of chemical tagging
gives us a high probability that they might be from the same open cluster. Only one candidate HIP 40317
which has solar metallicity and age could be a solar sibling. We performed simulations of the Sun's
birth cluster in analytical Galactic model and found that most of the radial velocities of the solar
siblings lie in the range $-10 \leq \mathrm{V_r}\leq 10$ $\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$, which is smaller
than the radial velocity of HIP 40317 $(\mathrm{V_r} = 34.2~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}})$, under different
Galactic parameters and different initial conditions of the Sun's birth cluster. The sibling status
for HIP 40317 is not directly supported by our dynamical analysis.
