We report the results from a search for z > 6.5 quasars using the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 dataset
combined with the VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS) and WISE All-Sky Survey. Our photometric selection
method is shown to be highly efficient in identifying clean samples of high-redshift quasars leading
to spectroscopic confirmation of three new quasars - VDESJ 0244-5008 (z=6.724), VDESJ 0020-3653
(z=6.834) and VDESJ 0246-5219 (z=6.90) - which were selected as the highest priority candidates
in the survey data without any need for additional follow-up observations. The new quasars span
the full range in luminosity covered by other z>6.5 quasar samples (J AB = 20.2 to 21.3; M1450 = -25.6
to -26.6). We have obtained spectroscopic observations in the near infrared for VDESJ 0244-5008
and VDESJ 0020-3653 as well as our previously identified quasar, VDESJ 0224-4711 at z=6.50 from
Reed et al. (2017). We use the near infrared spectra to derive virial black-hole masses from the full-width-half-maximum
of the MgII line. These black-hole masses are ~ 1 - 2 x 10$^9$M$_\odot$. Combining with the bolometric
luminosities of these quasars of L$_{\rm{bol}}\simeq$ 1 - 3 x 10$^{47}$implies that the Eddington
ratios are high - $\simeq$0.6-1.1. We consider the C\textrm{\textsc{IV}} emission line properties
of the sample and demonstrate that our high-redshift quasars do not have unusual C\textrm{\textsc{IV}}
line properties when compared to carefully matched low-redshift samples. Our new DES+VHS $z>6.5$
quasars now add to the growing census of luminous, rapidly accreting supermassive black-holes
seen well into the epoch of reionisation.
