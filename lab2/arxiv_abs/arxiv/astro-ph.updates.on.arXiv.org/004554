Machine learning techniques have been increasingly useful in astronomical applications over
the last few years, for example in the morphological classification of galaxies. Convolutional
neural networks have proven to be highly effective in classifying objects in image data. The current
work aims to establish when multiple components are present, in the astronomical context of synthesis
imaging observations of radio sources. To this effect, we design a convolutional neural network
to differentiate between different morphology classes using sources from the Radio Galaxy Zoo
(RGZ) citizen science project. In this first step, we focus on exploring the factors that affect
the performance of such neural networks, such as the amount of training data, number and nature of
layers and the hyperparameters. We begin with a simple experiment in which we only differentiate
between two extreme morphologies, using compact and multiple component extended sources. We found
that a three convolutional layer architecture yielded very good results, achieving a classification
accuracy of 97.4% on a test data set. The same architecture was then tested on a four-class problem
where we let the network classify sources into compact and three classes of extended sources, achieving
a test achieving a test accuracy of 93.5%. The best-performing convolutional neural network setup
has been verified against RGZ Data Release 1 where a final test accuracy of 94.8% was obtained, using
both original and augmented images. The use of sigma clipping does not offer a significant benefit
overall, except in cases with a small number of training images.
