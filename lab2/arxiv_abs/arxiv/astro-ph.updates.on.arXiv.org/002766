We investigate of the properties of $\sim$2000 Herschel/SPIRE-selected galaxies from $0<z<4$
using a combination of extensive spectroscopy, deep imaging from CFHT, VLA, Spitzer, XMM-Newton,
and Herschel, and well-calibrated SED fitting. Herschel galaxies are observed to span a range of
stellar masses, colors, and absolute magnitudes equivalent to galaxies undetected in SPIRE. Though
many Herschel galaxies appear to be in transition, such galaxies are largely consistent with normal
star-forming galaxies when rest-frame colors are utilized. The nature of the star-forming "main
sequence" is studied and we warn against adopting this framework unless the main sequence is determined
precisely. Herschel galaxies at different total infrared luminosities ($L_{TIR}$) are compared.
Bluer colors, larger nebular extinctions, and larger contributions from younger stellar populations
are observed for galaxies with larger $L_{TIR}$, suggesting that low-$L_{TIR}$ galaxies are undergoing
rejuvenated starbursts while galaxies with higher $L_{TIR}$ are forming a larger percentage of
their stellar mass. A variety of methods are used to select powerful active galactic nuclei (AGN).
Galaxies hosting AGN are observed to be undergoing starbursts more commonly and vigorously than
a matched sample of galaxies without powerful AGN and, additionally, the fraction of galaxies with
an AGN increases with increasing star formation rate at all redshifts. At all redshifts ($0<z<4$)
the most prodigious star-forming galaxies are found to contain the highest fraction of powerful
AGN. For redshift bins that allow a comparison ($z>0.5$), the highest $L_{TIR}$ galaxies in
a given redshift bin are unobserved by SPIRE at subsequently lower redshifts, a trend linked to downsizing.
In conjunction with other results, this evidence is used to argue for prevalent AGN-driven quenching
in starburst galaxies across cosmic time.
