We present a model of gamma-ray emission through neutral pion production and decay in two-temperature
accretion flows around supermassive black holes. We refine previous studies of such a hadronic
gamma-ray emission by taking into account (1) relativistic effects in the photon transfer and (2)
absorption of gamma-ray photons in the radiation field of the flow. We use a fully general relativistic
description of both the radiative and hydrodynamic processes, which allows us to study the dependence
on the black hole spin. The spin value strongly affects the gamma-ray emissivity within ~10 gravitational
radii. The central regions of flows with the total luminosities L < 0.001 of the Eddington luminosity
are mostly transparent to photons with energies below 10 GeV, permitting investigation of the effects
of space-time metric. For such L, an observational upper limit on the gamma-ray (0.1-10 GeV) to X-ray
(2-10 keV) luminosity ratio of L_{0.1-10 GeV}/L_{2-10 keV} << 0.1 can rule out rapid rotation
of the black hole; on the other hand, a measurement of L_{0.1-10 GeV}/L_{2-10 keV} ~ 0.1 cannot be
regarded as the evidence of rapid rotation, as such a ratio can also result from a flat radial profile
of gamma-ray emissivity (which would occur for nonthermal acceleration of protons in the whole
body of the flow). At L > 0.01 of the Eddington luminosity, the gamma-ray emission from the innermost
region is strongly absorbed and the observed gamma-rays do not carry information on the value of
the black hole spin. We note that if the X-ray emission observed in Centaurus A comes from an accretion
flow, the hadronic gamma-ray emission from the flow should contribute significantly to the MeV/GeV
emission observed from the core of this object, unless it contains a slowly rotating black hole and
protons in the flow are thermal.
