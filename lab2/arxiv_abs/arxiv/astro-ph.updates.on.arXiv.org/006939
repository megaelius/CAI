Observations have shown that massive star-forming clumps are present in the internal structure
of high-redshift galaxies. One way to study these clumps in detail with a higher spatial resolution
is by exploiting the power of strong gravitational lensing which stretches images on the sky. In
this work, we present an analysis of the clumpy galaxy A68-HLS115 at $z=1.5858$, located behind
the cluster Abell 68, but strongly lensed by a cluster galaxy member. Resolved observations with
SINFONI/VLT in the near-infrared show Ha, Hb, [NII], and [OIII] emission lines. Combined with images
covering the B band to the far-infrared and CO(2-1) observations, this makes this galaxy one of the
only sources for which such multi-band observations are available and for which it is possible to
study the properties of resolved star-forming clumps and to perform a detailed analysis of the integrated
properties, kinematics, and metallicity. We obtain a stability of $\upsilon_{rot}/\sigma_0
= 2.73$ by modeling the kinematics, which means that the galaxy is dominated by rotation, but this
ratio also indicates that the disk is marginally stable. We find a high intrinsic velocity dispersion
of $80\pm10$ km s$^{-1}$ that could be explained by the high gas fraction of $f_{gas}=0.75\pm0.15$
observed in this galaxy. This high $f_{gas}$ and the observed sSFR of $\rm 3.12 \, Gyr^{-1}$ suggest
that the disk turbulence and instabilities are mostly regulated by incoming gas. The direct measure
of the Toomre stability criterion of $Q_{crit}=0.70$ could also indicate the presence of a quasi-stable
thick disk. Finally, we identify three clumps in the Ha map which have similar velocity dispersions,
metallicities, and seem to be embedded in the rotating disk. These three clumps contribute together
to $40\%$ on the SFR(Ha) of the galaxy and show a SFR density about $100$ times higher than HII regions
in the local Universe.
