Because of the complex physics that governs the formation of chromospheric lines, interpretation
of solar chromospheric observations is difficult. The origin and characteristics of many chromospheric
features are, because of this, unresolved. We focus here on studying two prominent features: long
fibrils and flare ribbons. To model them, we use a 3D MHD simulation of an active region which self-consistently
reproduces both of them. We model the H$\alpha$, Mg II k, Ca II K, and Ca II 8542 {\AA} lines using the
3D non-LTE radiative transfer code Multi3D. This simulation reproduces long fibrils that span
between the opposite-polarity sunspots and go up to 4 Mm in height. They can be traced in all lines
due to density corrugation. Opposite to previous studies, H$\alpha$, Mg II h&k, and Ca II H&K, are
formed at similar height in this model. Magnetic field lines are aligned with the H$\alpha$ fibrils,
but the latter holds to a lesser extent for the Ca II 8542 {\AA} line. The simulation shows structures
in the H$\alpha$ line core that look like flare ribbons. The emission in the ribbons is caused by a
dense chromosphere and a transition region at high column mass. The ribbons are visible in all chromospheric
lines, but least prominent in Ca II 8542 {\AA} line. In some pixels, broad asymmetric profiles with
a single emission peak are produced, similar to the profiles observed in flare ribbons. They are
caused by a deep onset of the chromospheric temperature rise and large velocity gradients. The simulation
produces long fibrils similar to what is seen in observations. It also produces structures similar
to flare ribbons despite the lack of non-thermal electrons in the simulation. The latter suggests
that thermal conduction might be a significant agent in transporting flare energy to the chromosphere
in addition to non-thermal electrons.
