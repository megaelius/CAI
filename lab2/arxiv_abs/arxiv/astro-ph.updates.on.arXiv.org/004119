The second most significant detection of the Planck Sunyaev Zel'dovich survey, PLCK~G287.0+32.9
($z=0.385$) boasts two similarly bright radio relics and a radio halo. One radio relic is located
$\sim 400$ kpc northwest of the X-ray peak and the other $\sim 2.8$ Mpc to the southeast. This large
difference suggests that a complex merging scenario is required. A key missing puzzle for the merging
scenario reconstruction is the underlying dark matter distribution in high resolution. We present
a joint Subaru Telescope and {\it Hubble Space Telescope} weak-lensing analysis of the cluster.
Our analysis shows that the mass distribution features four significant substructures. Of the
substructures, a primary cluster of mass $M_{200\text{c}}=1.59^{+0.25}_{-0.22}\times 10^{15}
\ h^{-1}_{70} \ \text{M}_{\odot}$ dominates the weak-lensing signal. This cluster is likely to
be undergoing a merger with one (or more) subcluster whose mass is approximately a factor of 10 lower.
One candidate is the subcluster of mass $M_{200\text{c}}=1.16^{+0.15}_{-0.13}\times 10^{14}
\ h^{-1}_{70} \ \text{M}_{\odot}$ located $\sim 400$ kpc to the southeast. The location of this
subcluster suggests that its interaction with the primary cluster could be the source of the NW radio
relic. Another subcluster is detected $\sim 2$ Mpc to the SE of the X-ray peak with mass $M_{200\text{c}}=1.68^{+0.22}_{-0.20}\times
10^{14} \ h^{-1}_{70} \ \text{M}_{\odot}$. This SE subcluster is in the vicinity of the SE radio
relic and may have created the SE radio relic during a past merger with the primary cluster. The fourth
subcluster, $M_{200\text{c}}=1.87^{+0.24}_{-0.22}\times 10^{14} \ h^{-1}_{70} \ \text{M}_{\odot}$,
is northwest of the X-ray peak and beyond the NW radio relic.
