A recent study of the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in the Central Molecular Zone using very high
energy (VHE, E $>$ 0.1 TeV) H.E.S.S. data suggests that the Galactic Center (GC) is the most plausible
supplier of Galactic ultra-relativistic cosmic-rays (CRs) up to the knee at about 10$^{15}$ eV
(PeV). However, the GC might not be the only source capable to accelerate CRs up to PeV energies in
the Galaxy. Here we present H.E.S.S. data analysis results and interpretation of three H.E.S.S.
sources, with spectra extending beyond 10 TeV and relatively hard spectral indices compared with
the average spectral index of H.E.S.S. sources, namely HESS J1641-463, HESS J1741-302 and HESS
J1826-130. Although the nature of these VHE $\gamma$-ray sources is still open, their spectra suggest
that the astrophysical objects producing such emission must be capable of accelerating the parental
particle population up to energies of at least several hundreds of TeV. Assuming a hadronic scenario,
dense gas regions can provide rich target material for accelerated particles to produce VHE $\gamma$-ray
emission via proton-proton interactions followed by a subsequent $\pi^{0}$ decay. Thus, detailed
investigations of the interstellar medium along the line of sight to all of these sources have been
performed by using data from available atomic and molecular hydrogen surveys. The results point
out the existence of dense interstellar gas structures coincident with the best fit positions of
these sources. One can find possible hadronic models with CRs being accelerated close to the PeV
energies to explain the $\gamma$-ray emission from all of these sources, which opens up the possibility
that a population of PeV CR accelerators might be active in the Galaxy.
