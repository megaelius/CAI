Context: The details of how galaxies have evolved are imprinted in their star formation history,
chemical enrichment and morpho-kinematic structure. Parameters behind these can be measured
by combining photometric techniques with modelling. However, there are uncertainties from the
ambiguity of colour and magnitude and the effects of interstellar reddening. Aims: In this paper
we present a detailed reddening map of the central 30 Doradus region of the Large Magellanic Cloud;
for community use and to test the methods used. The reddening, a measurement of dust extinction,
acts as a tracer of the interstellar medium (ISM). Methods: Near infrared photometry of red clump
stars are used to measure reddening as extinction is the main cause of their colour and magnitude
variance. The star formation history is used to convert colour to reddening values which are subsequently
converted to visual extinction. Results: Presented is a dust map for the 30 Doradus field. This map
samples a region of 1x1.5 deg, containing ~1.5x10^5 red clump stars which probe reddening up to AV=6
mag. We compare our map with maps from the literature, including optical extinction maps and radio,
mid- and far-infrared maps of atomic hydrogen and dust emission. Through estimation of column density
we locate molecular clouds. Conclusions: This new reddening map shows correlation with equivalent
maps in the literature, validating the method of red clump star selection. We make our reddening
map available for community use. In terms of ISM the red clump stars appear to be more affected by the
cooler dust measured by 70 micron emission because there is stronger correlation between increasing
emission and extinction due to red clump stars not being located near hot stars that would heat the
dust. The transition from atomic hydrogen to molecular hydrogen occurs between densities of NH=4x10^21
to 6x10^21 cm^-2.
