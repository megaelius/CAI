Photometric surveys of galaxy clusters have revealed a large number of ultra compact dwarfs (UCDs)
around predominantly massive elliptical galaxies. Their origin is still debated as some UCDs are
considered to be the remnant nuclei of stripped dwarf galaxies while others seem to mark the high-mass
end of the star cluster population. We aim to characterise the properties of a UCD found at very close
projected distance (1.1 kpc) from the centre of the low-mass (M~10^10 M_sun) early-type galaxy
FCC47. This is a serendipitous discovery from MUSE adaptive optics science verification data.
We explore the potential origin of this UCD as either a massive cluster or the remnant nucleus of a
dissolved galaxy. We use archival Hubble Space Telescope data to study the photometric and structural
properties of FCC47-UCD1. In the MUSE data, the UCD is unresolved, but we use its spectrum to determine
the radial velocity and metallicity. FCC47-UCD1's surface brightness is best described by a single
King profile with low concentration C = R_t/R_c ~ 10 and large effective radius (r_e = 24pc). Its integrated
magnitude and a blue colour (G = -10.6 mag, g-z = 1.46 mag) combined with with a metallicity of [M/H]
= -1.12+-0.10 dex and an age > 8 Gyr obtained from the full fitting of the MUSE spectrum suggests a stellar
population mass of M_star = 4.87x10^6 M_sun. The low S/N of the MUSE spectrum prevents detailed stellar
population analysis. Due to the limited spectral resolution of MUSE, we can only give an upper limit
on the velocity dispersion (sig < 17km/s), and consequently on its dynamical mass (M_dyn < 1.3x10^7
M_sun). The origin of the UCD cannot be constrained with certainty. The low metallicity, old age
and magnitude are consistent with a star cluster origin, whereas the extended size is consistent
with an origin as the stripped nucleus of a dwarf galaxy with a initial stellar mass of a few 10^8 M_sun.
