A key legacy of the recently launched TESS mission will be to provide the astronomical community
with many of the best transiting exoplanet targets for atmospheric characterization. However,
time is of the essence to take full advantage of this opportunity. JWST, although delayed, will still
complete its nominal five year mission on a timeline that motivates rapid identification, confirmation,
and mass measurement of the top atmospheric characterization targets from TESS. Beyond JWST, future
dedicated missions for atmospheric studies such as ARIEL require the discovery and confirmation
of several hundred additional sub-Jovian size planets (R_p < 10 R_Earth) orbiting bright stars,
beyond those known today, to ensure a successful statistical census of exoplanet atmospheres.
Ground-based ELTs will also contribute to surveying the atmospheres of the transiting planets
discovered by TESS. Here we present a set of two straightforward analytic metrics, quantifying
the expected signal-to-noise in transmission and thermal emission spectroscopy for a given planet,
that will allow the top atmospheric characterization targets to be readily identified among the
TESS planet candidates. Targets that meet our proposed threshold values for these metrics would
be encouraged for rapid follow-up and confirmation via radial velocity mass measurements. Based
on the catalog of simulated TESS detections by Sullivan et al. (2015), we determine appropriate
cutoff values of the metrics, such that the TESS mission will ultimately yield a sample of $\sim300$
high-quality atmospheric characterization targets across a range of planet size bins, extending
down to Earth-size, potentially habitable worlds.
