Aims. The data set of the long-term XMM-Newton monitoring program of HD 81809 is analyzed to study
its X-ray cycle, to investigate if the latter is related to the chromospheric one, to infer the structure
of the corona of HD 81809, and to explore if the coronal activity of HD 81809 can be ascribed to phenomena
similar to the solar ones and, therefore, considered an extension of the solar case. Methods. We
analyze the observations of HD 81809 performed with XMM-Newton with a regular cadence of 6 months
from 2001 to 2016 and representing one of the longest available observational baseline ($\sim 15$~yr)
for a solar-like star with a well-studied chromospheric cycle (with a period of $\sim 8$~yr). We
investigate the modulation of coronal luminosity and temperature and its relation with the chromospheric
cycle. We interpret the data in terms of a mixture of solar-like coronal regions, adopting a methodology
originally proposed to study the Sun as an X-ray star. Results. The observations show a well-defined
regular cyclic modulation of the X-ray luminosity that reflects the activity level of HD 81809.
The data covers approximately two cycles of coronal activity; the modulation has an amplitude of
a factor of $\sim 5$ (excluding evident flares, as in the June 2002 observation) and a period of $7.3\pm
1.5$~yr, consistent with that of the chromospheric cycle. We demonstrate that the corona of HD 81809
can be interpreted as an extension of the solar case and it can be modeled with a mixture of solar-like
coronal regions along the whole cycle. The activity level is mainly determined by a varying coverage
of very bright active regions, similar to cores of active regions observed in the Sun. Evidence of
unresolved significant flaring activity is present especially in proximity of cycle maxima.
