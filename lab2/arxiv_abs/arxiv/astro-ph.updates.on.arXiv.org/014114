We analyse two-dimensional maps and radial profiles of the equivalent width of H$\alpha$ emission
(EW(H$\alpha$)), H$\delta$ absorption (EW(H$\delta_A$)), and the 4000\AA\ break (D$_n$(4000))
of low-redshift galaxies using integral field spectroscopy from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at
Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey. Out of $\approx2400$ nearly face-on galaxies with a redshift
$z<0.05$ from the MaNGA Products Launch 7, we identify 124 "turnover" galaxies that each have a central
upturn in EW(H$\alpha$), EW(H$\delta_A$) and/or a central drop in D$_n$(4000), indicative of
ongoing/recent star formation (SF). The turnover features are found mostly in galaxies with a stellar
mass above $\sim$10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ and NUV-$r$ colour less than $\approx5$. The majority
of the turnover galaxies are barred, with a bar fraction of 87$\pm$3\%. Furthermore, for barred
galaxies the radius of the central turnover region ($R_{\rm{t}}$) is found to tightly correlate
with the bar length ($R_{\rm{bar}}$): $R_{\rm{t}}$ = (0.35$\pm$0.02)$R_{\rm{bar}}$ + (0.61$\pm$0.13).
Comparing the observed and the inward extrapolated star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm
SFR}$), we estimate that the central SF rate have been enhanced by an order of magnitude. Conversely,
only half of the barred galaxies in our sample have a central turnover feature, implying that the
presence of a bar is not sufficient to lead to a central SF enhancement. We further examined the SF
enhancement in paired galaxies, as well as the density of the local environment, finding no relation.
This implies that environment is not a driving factor for central turnover and SF enhancement in
our sample galaxies.
