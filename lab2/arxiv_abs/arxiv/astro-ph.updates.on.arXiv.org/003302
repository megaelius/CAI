The DustPedia project is capitalising on the legacy of the Herschel Space Observatory, using cutting-edge
modelling techniques to study dust in the 875 DustPedia galaxies - representing the vast majority
of extended galaxies within 3000 km s$^{-1}$ that were observed by Herschel. This work requires
a database of multiwavelength imagery and photometry that greatly exceeds the scope (in terms of
wavelength coverage and number of galaxies) of any previous local-Universe survey. We constructed
a database containing our own custom Herschel reductions, along with standardised archival observations
from GALEX, SDSS, DSS, 2MASS, WISE, Spitzer, and Planck. Using these data, we performed consistent
aperture-matched photometry, which we combined with external supplementary photometry from
IRAS and Planck. We present our multiwavelength imagery and photometry across 42 UV-microwave
bands for the 875 DustPedia galaxies. Our aperture-matched photometry, combined with the external
supplementary photometry, represents a total of 21,857 photometric measurements. A typical DustPedia
galaxy has multiwavelength photometry spanning 25 bands. We also present the Comprehensive & Adaptable
Aperture Photometry Routine (CAAPR), the pipeline we developed to carry out our aperture-matched
photometry. CAAPR is designed to produce consistent photometry for the enormous range of galaxy
and observation types in our data. In particular, CAAPR is able to determine robust cross-compatible
uncertainties, thanks to a novel method for reliably extrapolating the aperture noise for observations
that cover a very limited amount of background. Our rich database of imagery and photometry is being
made available to the community
