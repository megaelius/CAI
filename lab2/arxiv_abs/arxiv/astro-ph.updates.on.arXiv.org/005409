Cosmological simulations predict that a significant fraction of the low-$z$ baryon budget resides
in large-scale filaments in the form of a diffuse plasma at temperatures $T \sim 10^{5} - 10^{7}$
K. However, direct observation of this so-called warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) has been
elusive. In the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, galaxy clusters correspond to the nodes of the cosmic web
at the intersection of several large-scale filamentary threads. In previous work, we used HST/COS
data to conduct the first survey of broad HI Ly$\alpha$ absorbers (BLAs) potentially produced by
WHIM in inter-cluster filaments. We targeted a single QSO, namely Q1410, whose sight-line intersects
$7$ independent inter-cluster axes at impact parameters $<3$ Mpc (co-moving), and found a tentative
excess of a factor of ${\sim}4$ with respect to the field. Here, we further investigate the origin
of these BLAs by performing a blind galaxy survey within the Q1410 field using VLT/MUSE. We identified
$77$ sources and obtained the redshifts for $52$ of them. Out of the total sample of $7$ BLAs in inter-cluster
axes, we found $3$ without any galaxy counterpart to stringent luminosity limits ($\sim 4 \times
10^{8}$ L$_{\odot}$ ${\sim} 0.01$ L$_{*}$), providing further evidence that these BLAs may represent
genuine WHIM detections. We combined this sample with other suitable BLAs from the literature and
inferred the corresponding baryon mean density for these filaments in the range $\Omega^{\rm fil}_{\rm
bar}= 0.02-0.04$. Our rough estimates are consistent with the predictions from numerical simulations
but still subject to large systematic uncertainties, mostly from the adopted geometry, ionization
corrections and density profile.
