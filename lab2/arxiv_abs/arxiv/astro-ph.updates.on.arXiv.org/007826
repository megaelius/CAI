Most radiative transfer models assume that dust in spiral galaxies is distributed exponentially.
In this paper our goal is to verify this assumption by analysing the two-dimensional large-scale
distribution of dust in galaxies from the DustPedia sample. For this purpose, we make use of Herschel
imaging in five bands, from 100 to 500{\mu}m, in which the cold dust constituent is primarily traced
and makes up the bulk of the dust mass in spiral galaxies. For a subsample of 320 disc galaxies, we successfully
perform a simultaneous fitting with a single S\'ersic model of the Herschel images in all five bands
using the multiband modelling code GALFITM. We report that the S\'ersic index $n$, which characterises
the shape of the S\'ersic profile, lies systematically below 1 in all Herschel bands and is almost
constant with wavelength. The average value at 250{\mu}m is $0.67\pm0.37$ (187 galaxies are fitted
with $n_{250}\leq0.75$, 87 galaxies have $0.75<n_{250}\leq1.25$, and 46 - with $n_{250}>1.25$).
Most observed profiles exhibit a depletion in the inner region (at $r<0.3-0.4$ of the optical radius
$r_{25}$ ) and are more or less exponential in the outer part. We also find breaks in the dust emission
profiles at longer distances $(0.5-0.6)r_{25}$ which are associated with the breaks in the optical
and near-infrared. We assume that the observed deficit of dust emission in the inner galaxy region
is related to the depression in the radial profile of the HI surface density in the same region because
the atomic gas reaches high enough surface densities there to be transformed into molecular gas.
If a galaxy has a triggered star formation in the inner region (for example, because of a strong bar
instability, which transfers the gas inwards to the centre, or a pseudobulge formation), no depletion
or even an excess of dust emission in the centre is observed.
