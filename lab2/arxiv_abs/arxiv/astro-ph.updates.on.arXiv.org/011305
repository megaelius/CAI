We develop and implement two new methods for constraining the scatter in the relationship between
galaxies and dark matter halos. These new techniques are sensitive to the scatter at low halo masses,
making them complementary to previous constraints that are dependent on clustering amplitudes
or rich galaxy groups, both of which are only sensitive to more massive halos. In both of our methods,
we use a galaxy group finder to locate central galaxies in the SDSS main galaxy sample. Our first technique
uses the small-scale cross-correlation of central galaxies with all lower mass galaxies. This
quantity is sensitive to the satellite fraction of low-mass galaxies, which is in turn driven by
the scatter between halos and galaxies. The second technique uses the kurtosis of the distribution
of line-of-sight velocities between central galaxies and neighboring galaxies. This quantity
is sensitive to the distribution of halo masses that contain the central galaxies at fixed stellar
mass. Theoretical models are constructed using peak halo circular velocity, $V_{\rm peak}$, as
our property to connect galaxies to halos. The cross-correlation technique yields a constraint
of $\sigma[ M_\ast|V_{\rm peak}]=0.27\pm 0.05$ dex, corresponding to a scatter in $\log M_\ast$
at fixed $M_h$ of $\sigma[ M_\ast|M_h]=0.38\pm 0.06$ dex at $M_h=10^{11.8}$ Msun. The kurtosis
technique yields $\sigma[ M_\ast|V_{\rm peak}]=0.30\pm0.03$, corresponding to $\sigma[ M_\ast|M_h]=0.34\pm
0.04$ at $M_h=10^{12.2}$ Msun. The values of $\sigma[ M_\ast|M_h]$ are significantly larger than
the constraints at higher masses, in agreement with the results of hydrodynamic simulations. This
increase is only partly due to the scatter between $V_{\rm peak}$ and $M_h$, and it represents an
increase of nearly a factor of two relative to the values inferred from clustering and group studies
at high masses.
