Coherent radio bursts detected from M dwarfs have some analogy with solar radio bursts, but reach
orders of magnitude higher luminosities. These events trace particle acceleration, powered by
magnetic reconnection, shock fronts (such as formed by coronal mass ejections, CMEs), and magnetospheric
currents, in some cases offering the only window into these processes in stellar atmospheres. We
conducted a 58-hour, ultra-wideband survey for coherent radio bursts on 5 active M dwarfs. We used
the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to observe simultaneously in three frequency bands covering
a subset of 224-482 MHz and 1-6 GHz, achieving the widest fractional bandwidth to date for any observations
of stellar radio bursts. We detected 22 bursts across 13 epochs, providing the first large sample
of wideband dynamic spectra of stellar coherent radio bursts. The observed bursts have diverse
morphology, with durations ranging from seconds to hours, but all share strong (40-100%) circular
polarization. No events resemble solar Type II bursts (often associated with CMEs), but we cannot
rule out the occurrence of radio-quiet stellar CMEs. The hours-long bursts are all polarized in
the sense of the x-mode of the star's large-scale magnetic field, suggesting they are cyclotron
maser emission from electrons accelerated in the large-scale field, analogous to auroral processes
on ultracool dwarfs. The duty cycle of luminous coherent bursts peaks at 25% at 1-1.4 GHz, declining
at lower and higher frequencies, indicating source regions in the low corona. At these frequencies,
active M dwarfs should be the most common galactic transient source.
