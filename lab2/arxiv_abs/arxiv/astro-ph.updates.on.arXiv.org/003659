Detection of transiting exoplanets around young stars is more difficult than for older systems
due to increased stellar variability. Nine young open cluster planets have been found in the K2 data,
but no single analysis pipeline identified all planets. We have developed a transit search pipeline
for young stars which uses a transit-shaped notch and quadratic continuum in a 12 or 24\,hour window
to fit both the stellar variability and the presence of a transit. In addition, for the most rapid
rotators (P$_\mathrm{rot}<2$\,days) we model the variability using a linear combination of observed
rotations of each star. To maximally exploit our new pipeline, we update the membership for four
stellar populations observed by K2 (Upper Scorpius, Pleiades, Hyades, Praesepe), and conduct
a uniform search of the members. We identify all known transiting exoplanets in the clusters, 17
eclipsing binaries, one transiting planet candidate orbiting a potential Pleiades member, and
three orbiting unlikely members of the young clusters. Limited injection-recovery testing on
the known planet hosts indicates that for the older Praesepe systems, we are sensitive to additional
exoplanets as small as 1-2\,R$_\oplus$, and for the larger Upper Scorpius planet host (K2-33) our
pipeline is sensitive to $\sim$4\,R$_\oplus$ transiting planets. The lack of detected multiple
systems in the young clusters is consistent with the expected frequency from the original Kepler
sample, within our detection limits. With a robust pipeline that detects all known planets in the
young clusters, occurrence rate testing at young ages is now possible.
