We select galaxies from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations ($M_*>10^9~\rm M_\odot$
at $0\le z\le2$) and characterize the shapes and evolutions of their UVJ and star-formation rate
-- stellar mass (SFR-$M_*$) diagrams. We quantify the systematic uncertainties related to different
criteria to classify star-forming vs. quiescent galaxies, different SFR estimates, and by accounting
for the star formation measured within different physical apertures. The TNG model returns the
observed features of the UVJ diagram at $z\leq2$, with a clear separation between two classes of
galaxies. It also returns a tight star-forming main sequence (MS) for $M_*<10^{10.5}\,\rm M_\odot$
with a $\sim0.3$ dex scatter at $z\sim0$ in our fiducial choices. If a UVJ-based cut is adopted, the
TNG MS exhibits a downwardly bending at stellar masses of about $10^{10.5-10.7}~\rm M_\odot$.
Moreover, the model predicts that $\sim80\,(50)$ per cent of $10^{10.5-11}~\rm M_\odot$ galaxies
at $z=0~(z=2)$ are quiescent and the numbers of quenched galaxies at intermediate redshifts and
high masses are in better agreement with observational estimates than previous models. However,
shorter SFR-averaging timescales imply higher normalizations and scatter of the MS, while smaller
apertures lead to underestimating the galaxy SFRs: overall we estimate the inspected systematic
uncertainties to sum up to about $0.2-0.3$ dex in the locus of the MS and to about 15 percentage points
in the quenched fractions. While TNG color distributions are clearly bimodal, this is not the case
for the SFR logarithmic distributions in bins of stellar mass (SFR$\geq 10^{-3}~\rm M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$).
Finally, the slope and $z=0$ normalization of the TNG MS are consistent with observational findings;
however, the locus of the TNG MS remains lower by about $0.2-0.5$ dex at $0.75\le z<2$ than the available
observational estimates taken at face value.
