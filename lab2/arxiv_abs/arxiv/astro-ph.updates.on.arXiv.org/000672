Since the discovery of kiloparsec-scale X-ray emission from quasar jets, the physical processes
responsible for their high- energy emission have been poorly defined. A number of mechanisms are
under active debate, including synchrotron radiation, inverse-Comptonized CMB (IC/CMB) emission,
and other inverse-Compton processes. In a number of cases, the optical and X-ray emission of jet
regions are linked by a single spectral component, and in those, high-resolution multi-band imaging
and polarimetry can be combined to yield a powerful diagnostic of jet emission processes. Here we
report on deep imaging polarimetry of the jet of PKS 1136$-$135 obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope.
We find that several knots are highly polarized in the optical, with fractional polarization >30%.
When combined with the broadband spectral shape observed, this is very difficult to explain via
IC/CMB models, unless the scattering particles are at the lowest-energy tip of the electron energy
distribution, with Lorentz factor $\gamma \sim 1$, and the jet is also very highly beamed ($\delta
\geq 20$) and viewed within a few degrees of the line of sight. We discuss both IC/CMB and synchrotron
interpretation of the X-ray emission in the light of this new evidence, presenting new models of
the spectral energy distribution and also the matter content. The high polarizations do not completely
rule out the possibility of IC/CMB optical-to-X-ray emission in knot A, but they strongly disfavor
the model, because the permitted parameter space is very restricted, and because PKS 1136-135 is
not a blazar, and thus its properties are inconsistent with what one would expect for such a highly
beamed source. We discuss the implications of this finding, and also the prospects for future work.
