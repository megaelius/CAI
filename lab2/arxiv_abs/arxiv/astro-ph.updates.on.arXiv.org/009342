We have used the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) to study the circumgalactic medium (CGM)
of a z = 2.92 radio galaxy, MRC 0943-242 by parametrising its emitting and absorbing gas. In both Ly$\alpha$
$\lambda$1216 and He II $\lambda$1640 lines, we observe emission with velocity shifts of $\Delta
v \simeq-1000$ km s$^{-1}$ from the systemic redshift of the galaxy. These blueshifted components
represent kinematically perturbed gas that is aligned with the radio axis, which we interpret as
jet-driven outflows. Three of the four known Ly$\alpha$ absorbers are detected at the same velocity
as C IV $\lambda\lambda1548,1551$ and N V $\lambda\lambda1239,1243$ absorbers, proving that
the gas is metal enriched more so than previously thought. At the velocity of a strong Ly$\alpha$
absorber with an HI column of $N_{\rm HI}/{\rm cm}^{-2} = 10^{19.2}$ and velocity shift of $\Delta
v \simeq -400$ km s$^{-1},$ we also detect Si II $\lambda$1260 and Si II $\lambda$1527 absorption,
which suggests that the absorbing gas is ionisation bounded. With the added sensitivity of this
MUSE observation, we are more capable of adding constraints to absorber column densities and consequently
determining what powers their ionisation. To do this, we obtain photoionisation grid models in
\pkg{cloudy} which show that AGN radiation is capable of ionising the gas and producing the observed
column densities in a gas of metallicity of Z/Z$_\odot \simeq$ 0.01 with a nitrogen abundance a factor
of 10 greater than that of hydrogen. This metal-enriched absorbing gas, which is also spatially
extended over a projected distance of $r \gtrsim 60$ kpc, is likely to have undergone chemical enrichment
through stellar winds that have swept up metals from the interstellar-medium and deposited them
in the outer regions of the galaxy's halo.
