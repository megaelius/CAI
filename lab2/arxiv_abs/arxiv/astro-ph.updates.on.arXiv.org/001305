We use the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope's SCUBA-2 camera to image a 400 arcmin^2 area surrounding
the GOODS-N field. The 850 micron rms noise ranges from a value of 0.49 mJy in the central region to
3.5 mJy at the outside edge. From these data, we construct an 850 micron source catalog to 2 mJy containing
49 sources detected above the 4-sigma level. We use an ultradeep (11.5 uJy at 5-sigma) 1.4 GHz image
obtained with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array together with observations made with the Submillimeter
Array to identify counterparts to the submillimeter galaxies. For most cases of multiple radio
counterparts, we can identify the correct counterpart from new and existing Submillimeter Array
data. We have spectroscopic redshifts for 62% of the radio sources in the 9 arcmin radius highest
sensitivity region (556/894) and 67% of the radio sources in the GOODS-N region (367/543). We supplement
these with a modest number of additional photometric redshifts in the GOODS-N region (30). We measure
millimetric redshifts from the radio to submillimeter flux ratios for the unidentified submillimeter
sample, assuming an Arp 220 spectral energy distribution. We find a radio flux dependent K-z relation
for the radio sources, which we use to estimate redshifts for the remaining radio sources. We determine
the star formation rates (SFRs) of the submillimeter sources based on their radio powers and their
submillimeter and find that they agree well. The radio data are deep enough to detect star-forming
galaxies with SFRs >2000 solar masses per year to z~6. We find galaxies with SFRs up to ~6,000 solar
masses per year over the redshift range z=1.5-6, but we see evidence for a turn-down in the SFR distribution
function above 2000 solar masses per year.
