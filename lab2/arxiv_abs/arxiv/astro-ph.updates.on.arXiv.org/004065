We present a novel $N$-body simulation method that compactifies the infinite spatial extent of
the Universe into a finite sphere with isotropic boundary conditions to follow the evolution of
the large-scale structure. Our approach eliminates the need for periodic boundary conditions,
a mere numerical convenience which is not supported by observation and which modifies the law of
force on large scales in an unrealistic fashion. We demonstrate that our method outclasses standard
simulations executed on workstation-scale hardware in dynamic range, it is balanced in following
a comparable number of high and low $k$ modes and, its fundamental geometry and topology match observations.
Our approach is also capable of simulating an expanding, infinite universe in static coordinates
with Newtonian dynamics. The price of these achievements is that most of the simulated volume has
smoothly varying mass and spatial resolution, an approximation that carries different systematics
than periodic simulations. Our initial implementation of the method is called StePS which stands
for Stereographically Projected Cosmological Simulations. It uses stereographic projection
for space compactification and naive $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ force calculation which is nevertheless
faster to arrive at a correlation function of the same quality than any standard (tree or P$^3$M)
algorithm with similar spatial and mass resolution. The $N^2$ force calculation is easy to adapt
to modern graphics cards, hence our code can function as a high-speed prediction tool for modern
large-scale surveys. To learn about the limits of the respective methods, we compare StePS with
GADGET-2 \citep{Gadget2_2005MNRAS.364.1105S} running matching initial conditions.
