A chemo-dynamical analysis of 115 metal-poor candidate stars selected from the narrow-band Pristine
photometric survey is presented based on CFHT high-resolution ESPaDoNS spectroscopy. We have
discover 28 new bright (V < 15) stars with [Fe/H]<-2.5 and 5 with [Fe/H]<-3.0 for success rates of
40% (28/70) and 19% (5/27), respectively. A detailed model atmospheres analysis is carried out
for the 28 new metal-poor stars. Stellar parameters were determined from SDSS photometric colours,
Gaia DR2 parallaxes, MESA/MIST stellar isochrones, and the initial Pristine survey metallicities,
following a Bayesian inference method. Chemical abundances are determined for 10 elements (Na,
Mg, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Y, Ba). Most stars show chemical abundance patterns that are similar to
the normal metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo; however, we also report the discoveries of a new
r-process rich star, a new CEMP-s candidate with [Y/Ba]>0, and a metal-poor star with very low [Mg/Fe].
The kinematics and orbits for all of the highly probable metal-poor candidates are determined by
combining our precision radial velocities with Gaia DR2 proper motions. Some stars show unusual
kinematics for their chemistries, including planar orbits, unbound orbits, and highly elliptical
orbits that plunge deeply into the Galactic bulge (Rperi < 0.5 kpc); also, eight stars have orbital
energies and actions consistent with the Gaia-Enceladus accretion event. This paper contributes
to our understanding of the complex chemo-dynamics of the metal-poor Galaxy, and increases the
number of known bright metal-poor stars available for detailed nucleosynthetic studies.
