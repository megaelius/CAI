We use the energy-balance code MAGPHYS to determine stellar and dust masses, and dust corrected
star-formation rates for over 200,000 GAMA galaxies, 170,000 G10-COSMOS galaxies and 200,000
3D-HST galaxies. Our values agree well with previously reported measurements and constitute a
representative and homogeneous dataset spanning a broad range in stellar mass (10^8---10^12 Msol),
dust mass (10^6---10^9 Msol), and star-formation rates (0.01---100 Msol per yr), and over a broad
redshift range (0.0 < z < 5.0). We combine these data to measure the cosmic star-formation history
(CSFH), the stellar-mass density (SMD), and the dust-mass density (DMD) over a 12 Gyr timeline.
The data mostly agree with previous estimates, where they exist, and provide a quasi-homogeneous
dataset using consistent mass and star-formation estimators with consistent underlying assumptions
over the full time range. As a consequence our formal errors are significantly reduced when compared
to the historic literature. Integrating our cosmic star-formation history we precisely reproduce
the stellar-mass density with an ISM replenishment factor of 0.50 +/- 0.07, consistent with our
choice of Chabrier IMF plus some modest amount of stripped stellar mass. Exploring the cosmic dust
density evolution, we find a gradual increase in dust density with lookback time. We build a simple
phenomenological model from the CSFH to account for the dust mass evolution, and infer two key conclusions:
(1) For every unit of stellar mass which is formed 0.0065---0.004 units of dust mass is also formed;
(2) Over the history of the Universe approximately 90 to 95 per cent of all dust formed has been destroyed
and/or ejected.
