The Effective Eddington Limit for dusty gas surrounding AGN is lower than the canonical Eddington
limit for hydrogen gas. Previous results from the Swift/BAT 9-month catalogue suggested that in
the overwhelming majority of local AGN, the dusty absorbing gas is below this Effective Eddington
limit, implying that radiation pressure is insufficient to blow away the absorbing clouds. We present
an analysis of three objects from that sample which were found to be close to the Effective Eddington
limit (NGC454, 2MASX J03565655-4041453 and XSS J05054-2348), using newly obtained XMM-Newton
data. We use the X-ray data to better constrain the absorbing column density, and supplement them
with XMM optical monitor (OM) data, infrared Spitzer and Herschel data where available to construct
a broad-band spectral energy distribution to estimate refined bolometric luminosities and Eddington
ratios for these three objects. The new XMM-Newton observations show all three objects moving away
from the region expected for short-lived absorption in the N_H-\lambda_{Edd} plane into the `long-lived
absorption' region. We find our conclusions robust to different methods for estimating the bolometric
luminosity and Eddington ratio. Interestingly, 2MASX J03565655-4041453 and XSS J05054-2348
now exhibit complex X-ray spectra, at variance with previous analyses of their Swift/XRT data.
We find evidence for absorption variability in NGC 454 and 2MASX J03565655-4041453, perhaps implying
that although the radiation pressure from the central engine is insufficient to cause clearly detectable
outflows, it may cause absorption variations over longer timescales. However, more robust black
hole mass estimates would improve the accuracy of the Eddington ratio estimates for these objects.
