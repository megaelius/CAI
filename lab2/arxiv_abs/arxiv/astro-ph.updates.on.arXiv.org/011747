Modern developments in quantum gravity suggest that the Standard Model (SM) degrees of freedom
are not unique; that a typical low energy effective theory should include a large assortment of hidden
sector degrees of freedom. It is therefore puzzling that cosmological constraints from BBN and
CMB reveal that the early universe was almost entirely dominated by the SM, when the inflaton $\phi$
could have decayed into many sectors. Furthermore, the SM possesses an instability at high scales
that would be catastrophic during or just after inflation, and yet no new physics has been seen to
alter this. In this work we propose the following explanation for all of this: the hidden sectors
are in fact entirely natural; this means all unprotected masses are pushed up to high scales and project
out of the spectrum, while only massless (or protected) degrees of freedom remain, and so the inflaton
can only reheat these sectors through higher dimension (and suppressed) operators. On the other
hand, the SM possesses a special feature: it includes a light Higgs $H$, presumably for life to exist,
and hence it allows a super-renormalizable coupling to the inflaton $\phi\, H^\dagger H$, which
allows rapid decay into the SM. We show that this naturally (i) removes the instability in the Higgs
potential both during and after inflation, (ii) explains why the SM is dominant in the early universe,
(iii) allows dark matter to form in hidden sector/s through subsequent dynamics (or axions, etc),
(iv) allows for high reheating and baryogenesis, and (v) accounts for why there so far has been no
direct detection of dark matter or new physics beyond the SM.
