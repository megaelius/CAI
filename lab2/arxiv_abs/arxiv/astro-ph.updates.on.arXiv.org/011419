We search for dynamical substructures in the LAMOST DR3 very metal-poor (VMP) star catalog. After
cross-matching with Gaia DR2, there are 3300 VMP stars with available high-quality astrometric
information that have halo-like kinematics. We apply a method based on self-organizing maps to
find groups clustered in the 4D space of orbital energy and angular momentum. We identify 57 dynamically
tagged groups, which we label DTG-1 to DTG-57. Most of them belong to existing substructures in the
nearby halo, such as the $Gaia$ Sausage or Sequoia. The stream identified by Helmi et al. is recovered,
but the two disjoint portions of the substructure have distinct dynamical properties. The very
retrograde substructure Rg5 found previously by Myeong et al. is also retrieved. We report 6 new
DTGs with highly retrograde orbits, 2 with very prograde orbits, and 12 with polar orbits. By mapping
other datasets (APOGEE halo stars, and catalogs of r-process-enhanced and CEMP stars) onto the
trained neuron map, we can associate stars with detailed chemical abundances to the DTGs, and look
for associations with chemically peculiar stars. The highly eccentric $Gaia$ Sausage groups contain
representatives both of debris from the satellite itself (which is $\alpha$-poor) and the Splashed
Disk, sent up into eccentric halo orbits from the encounter (and is $\alpha$-rich). The new prograde
substructures also appear to be associated with the Splashed Disk. The DTGs belonging to the $Gaia$
Sausage host two relatively metal-rich $r$-II stars and six CEMP stars in different sub-classes,
consistent with the idea that the $Gaia$ Sausage progenitor is a massive dwarf galaxy. Rg5 is dynamically
associated with two highly $r$-process-enhanced stars with [Fe/H] $\sim -$3. This finding indicates
that its progenitor might be an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy that has experienced $r$-process enrichment
from neutron star mergers.
