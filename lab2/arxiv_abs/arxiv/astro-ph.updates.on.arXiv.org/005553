We used spectropolarimetric observations of a sunspot in active region NOAA 11809 in the Ca ii line
at 854.2 nm taken with the SpectroPolarimeter for Optical and Infrared Regions (SPINOR) at the Dunn
Solar Telescope to infer thermodynamic parameters along one hundred super-penumbral fibrils
that harbor the inverse Evershed flow. The fibrils were identified in line-of-sight (LOS) velocity
and line core intensity maps and were located in a segment of the sunspot that showed a regular penumbra
in the photosphere. The chromospheric LOS velocity abruptly decreases from 3 to 15 km/s to zero at
the inner footpoints of the fibrils that are located from the mid penumbra to about 1.4 spot radii.
The spectra often show multiple components, i.e., one at the rest wavelength and one with a strong
red shift, which indicates spatially or vertically unresolved structures. The line-core intensity
always peaks slightly closer to the umbra than the LOS velocity. An inversion of the spectra with
the CAlcium Inversion using a Spectral ARchive (CAISAR) code provided us with temperature stratifications
that allowed us to trace individual fibrils through the atmosphere and to determine the angle of
the flows relative to the surface without any additional assumptions on the flow topology such as
radial symmetry. We find that the fibrils are not horizontal near the downflow points, but make an
angle of 30 to 60 degrees to the local vertical. The temperature is enhanced by 200K at log(tau) ~ -2
and up to 2000K at log(tau) ~ -6 over that of the quiet Sun, whereas there is no signature in the low photosphere.
Our results are consistent with a critical, i.e., sonic, or super-sonic siphon flow along super-penumbral
flux tubes in which accelerating plasma abruptly attains sub-critical velocity through a standing
shock in or near the penumbra as predicted by Montesinos & Thomas (1993).
