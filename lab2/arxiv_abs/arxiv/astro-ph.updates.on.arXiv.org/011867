The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R (GOES-R) series of four satellites are
the next generation NOAA GOES satellites. Once on orbit and commissioned, they are renamed GOES
16-19, making critical terrestrial and space weather measurements through 2035. GOES 16 and 17
are currently on orbit, having been launched in 2016 and 2018, respectively. The GOES-R satellites
include the EUV and X-ray Irradiance Sensors (EXIS) instrument suite, which measures calibrated
solar irradiance in 8 lines or bands between 25 and 285 nm with the Extreme Ultraviolet Sensors (EUVS)
instrument. EXIS also includes the X-Ray Sensor (XRS) instrument, which measures solar soft X-ray
irradiance at the legacy GOES bands. The EUVS measurements are used as inputs to the EUVS Model, a
solar spectral irradiance model for space weather operations that predicts irradiance in twenty-two
5 nm wide intervals from 5 nm to 115 nm, and one 10 nm wide interval from 117 to 127 nm at 30 second cadence.
Once fully operational, NOAA will distribute the EUVS Model irradiance with 1 minute latency as
a primary space weather data product, ushering in a new era of rapid dissemination and measurement
continuity of EUV irradiance spectra. This paper describes the EUVS Model algorithms, data sources,
calibration methods and associated uncertainties. Typical model (relative) uncertainties are
less than $\sim$5\% for variability at time-scales longer than 6 hours, and are $\sim$25\% for solar
flare induced variability. The absolute uncertainties, originating from the instruments used
to calibrate the EUVS Model, are $\sim$10\%. Examples of model results are presented at both sub-daily
and multi-year timescales to demonstrate the model's capabilities and limitations. Example solar
flare irradiances are also modeled.
