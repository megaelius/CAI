We performed a 3D radiative MHD simulation of the solar atmosphere. This simulation shows a jet-like
feature that shows similarities to the type II spicules observed for the first time with Hinode.
Rapid Blueshifted Events (RBEs) on the solar disk are associated with these spicules. Observational
results suggest they may contribute significantly in supplying the corona with hot plasma. We perform
a detailed comparison of the properties of the simulated jet with those of type II spicules (observed
with Hinode) and RBEs (with ground-based instruments). We analyze variety of synthetic emission
and absorption lines from the simulations including chromospheric Ca II and Ha to TR and coronal
temperatures (10E4 to several 10E6K). We compare their synthetic intensities, line profiles,
Doppler shifts, line widths and asymmetries with observations from Hinode/SOT and EIS, SOHO/SUMER,
SST and SDO/AIA. Many properties of the synthetic observables resemble the observations, and we
describe in detail the physical processes that lead to these observables. Detailed analysis of
the synthetic observables provides insight into how observations should be analyzed to derive
information about physical variables in such a dynamic event. For example, we find that LOS superposition
in the optically thin atmosphere requires the combination of Doppler shifts and spectral line asymmetry
to determine the velocity in the jet. Other properties differ from the observations, especially
in the chromospheric lines. The mass density of the part of the spicule with a chromospheric temperature
is too low to produce significant opacity in chromospheric lines. These and other discrepancies
are described in detail, and we discuss which mechanisms and physical processes may need to be included
in the MHD simulations to mimic the thermodynamic processes of the chromosphere and corona, in particular
to reproduce type II spicules.
