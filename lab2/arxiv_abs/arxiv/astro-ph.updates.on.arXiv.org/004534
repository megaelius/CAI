We explore constraints on the joint photometric and morphological evolution of typical low redshift
galaxies as they move from the blue cloud through the green valley and onto the red sequence. We select
GAMA survey galaxies with $10.25<{\rm log}(M_*/M_\odot)<10.75$ and $z<0.2$ classified according
to their intrinsic $u^*-r^*$ colour. From single component S\'ersic fits, we find that the stellar
mass-sensitive $K-$band profiles of red and green galaxy populations are very similar, while $g-$band
profiles indicate more disk-like morphologies for the green galaxies: apparent (optical) morphological
differences arise primarily from radial mass-to-light ratio variations. Two-component fits
show that most green galaxies have significant bulge and disk components and that the blue to red
evolution is driven by colour change in the disk. Together, these strongly suggest that galaxies
evolve from blue to red through secular disk fading and that a strong bulge is present prior to any
decline in star formation. The relative abundance of the green population implies a typical timescale
for traversing the green valley $\sim 1-2$~Gyr and is independent of environment, unlike that of
the red and blue populations. While environment likely plays a r\^ole in triggering the passage
across the green valley, it appears to have little effect on time taken. These results are consistent
with a green valley population dominated by (early type) disk galaxies that are insufficiently
supplied with gas to maintain previous levels of disk star formation, eventually attaining passive
colours. No single event is needed quench their star formation.
