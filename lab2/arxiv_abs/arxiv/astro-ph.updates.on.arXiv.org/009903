A previous study of the X-ray luminosity function of the X-ray sources in the field of the Draco dwarf
spheroidal (dSph) galaxy indicated the presence of a population of unknown X-ray sources in the
soft energy range of 0.5-2 keV. In 2015, Draco dSph was observed again in twenty-six deep \xmm\, observations
providing an opportunity for a new study of the yet unclassified sources. We apply the classification
criteria presented in our previous multi-wavelength study of the X-ray sources of the Draco dSph
to the sources detected in the combined 2009 and 2015 \xmm\, data set. These criteria are based on
X-ray studies and properties of the optical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared counterparts and
allows us to distinguish background active galactic nuclei~(AGNs) and galaxies from other types
of X-ray sources. We present the classification of X-ray sources, for which the counterpart is identified
as a stellar object based on our criteria from multi-wavelength data. We identify three new symbiotic
stars in the Draco dSph with X-ray luminosities between $\sim$3.5$\times10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$
and 5.5$\times10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The X-ray spectral analysis shows that two of the classified
symbiotic stars are $\beta$-type. This is the first identification of this class of symbiotic stars
in a nearby galaxy. Eight sources are classified as Galactic M\,dwarfs in the field of the Draco dSph.
The distances of these M\,dwarfs are between$\sim$140-800 pc, their X-ray luminosities are between
$10^{28}-10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and the logarithmic ratio of X-ray to bolometric luminosity, log$(\frac{L_\text{X}}{L_\text{bol}})$,
is between $-3.4$ to $-2.1$. The multiple observations allowed us to investigate flare activity
of the M~dwarfs. Moreover, we classified three foreground sources, located at distances of the
order of $\sim$1-3 kpc in the field of the Draco dSph.
