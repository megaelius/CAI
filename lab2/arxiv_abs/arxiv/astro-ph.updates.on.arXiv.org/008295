The search for twins of the Sun and Earth relies on accurate characterization of stellar and exoplanetary
parameters: i.e., ages, masses, and radii. In the modern era of asteroseismology, parameters of
solar-like stars are derived by fitting theoretical models to observational data, which include
measurements of their oscillation frequencies, metallicity [Fe/H], and effective temperature
Teff. Combining this information with transit data furthermore yields the corresponding parameters
for their exoplanets. While [Fe/H] and Teff are commonly stated to a precision of ~0.1 dex and ~100
K, the impact of errors in their measurement has not been studied in practice within the context of
the parameters derived from them. Here we use the Stellar Parameters in an Instant (SPI) pipeline
to estimate the parameters of nearly 100 stars observed by Kepler and Gaia, many of which are confirmed
planet hosts. We adjust the reported spectroscopic measurements of these stars by introducing
faux systematic errors and artificially increasing the reported uncertainties, and quantify
the differences in the resulting parameters. We find that a systematic error of 0.1 dex in [Fe/H]
translates to differences of only 4%, 2%, and 1% on average in the resulting stellar ages, masses,
and radii, which are well within their uncertainties (~11%, 3.5%, 1.4%) as derived by SPI. We also
find that increasing the uncertainty of [Fe/H] measurements by 0.1 dex increases the uncertainties
by only 0.01 Gyr, 0.02 M_sun, and 0.01 R_sun, which are again well below their reported uncertainties
(0.5 Gyr, 0.04 M_sun, 0.02 R_sun). The results for Teff at 100 K are similar. Stellar parameters from
SPI are unchanged within uncertainties by errors of up to 0.14 dex or 175 K, and are even more robust
to errors in Teff than the seismic scaling relations. Consequently, the parameters for their exoplanets
are robust as well.
