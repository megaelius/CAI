In the framework of the planar and circular restricted three-body problem, we consider an asteroid
that orbits the Sun in quasi-satellite motion with a planet. A quasi-satellite trajectory is a heliocentric
orbit in co-orbital resonance with the planet, characterized by a non zero eccentricity and a resonant
angle that librates around zero. Likewise, in the rotating frame with the planet it describes the
same trajectory as the one of a retrograde satellite even though the planet acts as a perturbator.
In the last few years, the discoveries of asteroids in this type of motion made the term "quasi-satellite"
more and more present in the literature. However, some authors rather use the term "retrograde satellite"
when referring to this kind of motion in the studies of the restricted problem in the rotating frame.
In this paper we intend to clarify the terminology to use, in order to bridge the gap between the perturbative
co-orbital point of view and the more general approach in the rotating frame. Through a numerical
exploration of the co-orbital phase space, we describe the quasi-satellite domain and highlight
that it is not reachable by low eccentricities by averaging process. We will show that the quasi-satellite
domain is effectively included in the domain of the retrograde satellites and neatly defined in
terms of frequencies. Eventually, we highlight a remarkable high eccentric quasi-satellite orbit
corresponding to a frozen ellipse in the heliocentric frame. We extend this result to the eccentric
case (planet on an eccentric motion) and show that two families of frozen ellipses originate from
this remarkable orbit.
