We study the chemical abundances of a wide sample of 142 Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe) with good
quality observations, for which the abundances have been derived more or less homogeneously, thus
allowing a reasonable comparison with stellar models. The goal is the determination of mass, chemical
composition and formation epoch of their progenitors, through comparison of the data with results
from AGB evolution. The dust properties of PNe, when available, were also used to further support
our interpretation. We find that the majority ($\sim60\%$) of the Galactic PNe studied has nearly
solar chemical composition, while $\sim40\%$ of the sources investigated have sub-solar metallicities.
About half of the PNe have carbon star progenitors, in the $1.5~M_{\odot} < M < 3~M_{\odot}$ mass
range, which have formed between 300 Myr and 2 Gyr ago. The remaining PNe are almost equally distributed
among PNe enriched in nitrogen, which we interpret as the progeny of $M > 3.5~M_{\odot}$ stars, younger
than 250 Myr, and a group of oxygen-rich PNe, descending from old ($> 2$ Gyr) low-mass ($M < 1.5~M_{\odot}$)
stars that never became C-stars. This analysis confirms the existence of an upper limit to the amount
of carbon which can be accumulated at the surface of carbon stars, probably due to the acceleration
of mass loss in the late AGB phases. The chemical composition of the present sample suggests that
in massive AGB stars of solar (or slightly sub-solar) metallicity, the effects of third dredge up
combine with hot bottom burning, resulting in nitrogen-rich - but not severely carbon depleted
- gaseous material to be ejected.
