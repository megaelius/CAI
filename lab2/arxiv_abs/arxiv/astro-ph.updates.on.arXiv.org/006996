We report on a superdense star-forming region with an effective radius (R_e) smaller than 13 pc identified
at z=6.143 and showing a star-formation rate density \Sigma_SFR~1000 Msun/yr/kpc2 (or conservatively
>300 Msun/yr/kpc2). Such a dense region is detected with S/N>40 hosted by a dwarf extending over
440 pc, dubbed D1 (Vanzella et al. 2017b). D1 is magnified by a factor 17.4+/-5.0 behind the Hubble
Frontier Field galaxy cluster MACS~J0416 and elongated tangentially by a factor 13.2+/-4.0 (including
the systematic errors). The lens model accurately reproduces the positions of the confirmed multiple
images with a r.m.s. of 0.35", and the tangential stretch is well depicted by a giant multiply-imaged
Lya arc. D1 is part of an interacting star-forming complex extending over 800 pc. The SED-fitting,
the very blue ultraviolet slope (\beta ~ -2.5, F(\lambda) ~ \lambda^\beta) and the prominent Lya
emission of the stellar complex imply that very young (< 10-100 Myr), moderately dust-attenuated
(E(B-V)<0.15) stellar populations are present and organised in dense subcomponents. We argue
that D1 (with a stellar mass of 2 x 10^7 Msun) might contain a young massive star cluster of M < 10^6 Msun
and Muv~-15.6 (or m_uv=31.1), confined within a region of 13 pc, and not dissimilar from some local
super star clusters (SSCs). The ultraviolet appearance of D1 is also consistent with a simulated
local dwarf hosting a SSC placed at z=6 and lensed back to the observer. This compact system fits into
some popular globular cluster formation scenarios. We show that future high spatial resolution
imaging (e.g., E-ELT/MAORY-MICADO and VLT/MAVIS) will allow us to spatially resolve light profiles
of 2-8 pc.
