We use zoom hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the properties of satellites within galaxy-sized
dark-matter haloes with different assembly histories. We consider two classes of haloes at redshift
$z=0$: `stalled' haloes that assembled at $z>1$ and `accreting' ones that are still forming nowadays.
Previously, we showed that the stalled haloes are embedded within thick filaments of the cosmic
web while the accreting ones lie where multiple thin filaments converge. We find that satellites
in the two classes have both similar and different properties. Their mass spectra, radial count
profiles, baryonic and stellar content, and the amount of material they shed are indistinguishable.
However, the mass fraction locked in satellites is substantially larger for the accreting haloes
as they experience more mergers at late times. The largest difference is found in the satellite kinematics.
Substructures fall towards the accreting haloes along quasi-radial trajectories whereas an important
tangential velocity component is developed, before accretion, while orbiting the filament that
surrounds the stalled haloes. Thus, the velocity anisotropy parameter of the satellites ($\beta$)
is positive for the accreting haloes and negative for the stalled ones. This signature enables us
to tentatively categorize the Milky Way halo as stalled based on a recent measurement of $\beta$.
Half of our haloes contain clusters of satellites with aligned orbital angular momenta corresponding
to flattened structures in space. These features are not driven by baryonic physics and are only
found in haloes hosting grand-design spiral galaxies, independently of their assembly history.
