Disentangling the different stages of the star-formation process, in particular in the high-mass
regime, is a challenge in astrophysics. Chemical clocks could help alleviating this problem, but
their evolution strongly depends on many parameters, leading to degeneracy in the interpretation
of the observational data. One of these uncertainties is the degree of CO depletion. We present here
the first self-consistent magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of high-mass star-forming regions
at different scales, fully coupled with a non-equilibrium chemical network, which includes C-N-O
bearing molecules. Depletion and desorption processes are treated time-dependently. The results
show that full CO-depletion (i.e. all gas-phase CO frozen-out on the surface of dust grains), can
be reached very quickly, in one third or even smaller fractions of the free-fall time, whether the
collapse proceeds on slow or fast timescales. This leads to a high level of deuteration in a short
time both for typical tracers like N$_2$H$^+$, as well as for the main ion H$_3^+$, the latter being
in general larger and more extended. N$_2$ depletion is slightly less efficient, and no direct effects
on N-bearing molecules and deuterium fractionation are observed. We show that CO depletion is not
the only driver of deuteration, and that there is a strong impact on $D_{frac}$ when changing the
grain-size. We finally apply a two-dimensional gaussian Point Spread Function to our results to
mimic observations with single-dish and interferometers. Our findings suggest that the low-values
observed in high-mass star-forming clumps are in reality masking a full-depletion stage in the
inner 0.1 pc region.
