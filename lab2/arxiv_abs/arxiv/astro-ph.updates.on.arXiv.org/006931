Disk reverberation mapping of a handful of nearby AGN suggest accretion disk sizes which are a factor
few too large for their luminosities, apparently at odds with the standard model. Here, we investigate
the likely contribution to the measured delay signature of diffuse continuum emission arising
from broad line region gas. We start by constructing spherically symmetric pressure-law BLR models
(i.e., $P(r)\propto r^{-s}$) that approximately reproduce the observed emission line fluxes
of the strong UV--optical emission-lines in the best-studied source, NGC~5548. We then determine
the contribution of the diffuse continuum to the measured continuum flux and inter-band delays,
accounting for the observed variability behaviour of the ionizing nuclear continuum. Those pressure-law
models that approximately reproduce the observed emission-line luminosities unavoidably produce
substantial diffuse continuum emission. This causes a significant contamination of the disk reverberation
signature (i.e., wavelength-dependent continuum delays). Qualitatively, the diffuse continuum
delay signatures produced by our models resemble that observed for NGC~5548, including the deviation
of the lag spectrum above that of a simple power-law in wavelength, short-ward of the Balmer and Paschen
jumps. Furthermore, for reasonable estimates of the BLR covering fraction, the delay induced by
diffuse continuum emission causes elevated inter-band delays over the entire UV--optical regime;
for these pressure-law models, there are no `disk-dominated' wavelength intervals. Thus, the
diffuse continuum contribution must be taken into account in order to correctly infer AGN accretion
disk sizes based on inter-band continuum delays.
