We investigate the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements in the winds ejected by accretion disks formed
in neutron star mergers. We compute the element formation in disk outflows from hypermassive neutron
star (HMNS) remnants of variable lifetime, including the effect of angular momentum transport
in the disk evolution. We employ long-term axisymmetric hydrodynamic disk simulations to model
the ejecta, and compute r-process nucleosynthesis with tracer particles using a nuclear reaction
network containing $\sim 8000$ species. We find that the previously known strong correlation between
HMNS lifetime, ejected mass, and average electron fraction in the outflow is directly related to
the amount of neutrino irradiation on the disk, which dominates mass ejection at early times in the
form of a neutrino-driven wind. Production of lanthanides and actinides saturates at short HMNS
lifetimes ($\lesssim 10$ ms), with additional ejecta contributing to a blue optical kilonova component
for longer-lived HMNSs. We find good agreement between the abundances from the disk outflow alone
and the solar r-process distribution only for short HMNS lifetimes ($\lesssim 10$ ms). For longer
lifetimes, the rare-earth and third r-process peaks are significantly under-produced compared
to the solar pattern, requiring additional contributions from the dynamical ejecta. The nucleosynthesis
signature from a spinning black hole (BH) can only overlap with that from a HMNS of moderate lifetime
($\lesssim 60$ ms). Finally, we show that angular momentum transport not only contributes with
a late-time outflow component, but that it also enhances the neutrino-driven component by moving
material to shallower regions of the gravitational potential, in addition to providing additional
heating.
