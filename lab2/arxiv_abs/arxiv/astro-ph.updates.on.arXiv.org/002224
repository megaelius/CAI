Our knowledge of the long-term evolution of solar activity and of its primary modulation, the 11-year
cycle, largely depends on a single direct observational record: the visual sunspot counts that
retrace the last 4 centuries, since the invention of the astronomical telescope. Currently, this
activity index is available in two main forms: the International Sunspot Number initiated by R.
Wolf in 1849 and the Group Number constructed more recently by Hoyt and Schatten (1998a,b). Unfortunately,
those two series do not match by various aspects, inducing confusions and contradictions when used
in crucial contemporary studies of the solar dynamo or of the solar forcing on the Earth climate.
Recently, new efforts have been undertaken to diagnose and correct flaws and biases affecting both
sunspot series, in the framework of a series of dedicated Sunspot Number Workshops. Here, we present
a global overview of our current understanding of the sunspot number calibration. While the early
part of the sunspot record before 1800 is still characterized by large uncertainties due to poorly
observed periods, the more recent sunspot numbers are mainly affected by three main inhomogeneities:
in 1880-1915 for the Group Number and in 1947 and 1980-2014 for the Sunspot Number. The newly corrected
series clearly indicates a progressive decline of solar activity before the onset of the Maunder
Minimum, while the slowly rising trend of the activity after the Maunder Minimum is strongly reduced,
suggesting that by the mid 18th century, solar activity had already returned to the level of those
observed in recent solar cycles in the 20th century. We finally conclude with future prospects opened
by this epochal revision of the Sunspot Number, the first one since Wolf himself, and its reconciliation
with the Group Number, a long-awaited modernization that will feed solar cycle research into the
21st century.
