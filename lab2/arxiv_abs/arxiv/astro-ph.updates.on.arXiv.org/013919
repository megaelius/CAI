Motivated by the observation of comets and asteroids rotating in non-principal axis (NPA) states,
we investigate the relaxation of a freely precessing triaxial ellipsoidal rotator towards its
lowest-energy spin state. Relaxation of the precession arises from internal dissipative stresses
generated by self-gravitation and inertial forces from spin. We develop a general theory to determine
the viscoelastic stresses in the rotator, under any linear rheology, for both long-axis (LAM) and
short-axis (SAM) modes. By the methods of continuum mechanics, we calculate the power dissipated
by the stress field and the viscoelastic material strain which enables us to determine the timescale
of the precession dampening. To illustrate how the theory is used, we apply our framework to a triaxial
1I/2017 (`Oumuamua) and 4179 Toutatis under the Maxwell regime. For the former, employing viscoelastic
parameters typical of very cold monolithic asteroids renders a dampening timescale longer by a
factor of $10^{10}$ and higher than the timescales found in the works relying on the $\,Q$-factor
approach, whilst the latter yields a significantly shorter timescale as a consequence of including
self-gravitation. We further reduce our triaxial theory to bodies of an oblate geometry and derive
a family of relatively simple analytic approximations determining the NPA dampening times for
Maxwell rotators, as well as a criterion determining whether self-gravitation is negligible in
the relaxation process. Our approximations exhibit a relative error no larger than $0.2\%$, when
compared to numerical integration, for close to non-dissipative bodies and $0.002\%$ for highly
energy dissipating rotators.
