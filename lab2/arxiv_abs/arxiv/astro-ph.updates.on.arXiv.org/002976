Recent observations and analysis of low mass (<10$M_{\oplus}$), exoplanets have found that rocky
planets only have radii up to 1.5-2$R_{\oplus}$. Two general hypotheses exist for the cause of the
dichotomy between rocky and gas-enveloped planets (or possible water worlds): either low mass
planets do not necessarily form thick atmospheres of a few wt. %, or the thick atmospheres on these
planets easily escape driven by x-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) emissions from young parent
stars. Here we show that a cutoff between rocky and gas-enveloped planets due to hydrodynamic escape
is most likely to occur at a mean radius of 1.76$\pm$0.38 (2$\sigma$) $R_{\oplus}$ around Sun-like
stars. We examine the limit in rocky planet radii predicted by hydrodynamic escape across a wide
range of possible model inputs using 10,000 parameter combinations drawn randomly from plausible
parameter ranges. We find a cutoff between rocky and gas-enveloped planets that agrees with the
observed cutoff. The large cross-section available for XUV absorption in the extremely distended
primitive atmospheres of low mass planets results in complete loss of atmospheres during the ~100
Myr phase of stellar XUV saturation. In contrast, more massive planets have less distended atmospheres
and less escape, and so retain thick atmospheres through XUV saturation and then indefinitely as
the XUV and escape fluxes drop over time. The agreement between our model and exoplanet data leads
us to conclude that hydrodynamic escape plausibly explains the observed upper limit on rocky planet
size and few planets (a "valley") in the 1.5-2$R_{\oplus}$ range.
