The population of Be/X-ray binaries shows strong evidence of bimodality, especially in the spin
period of neutron stars. Several physical mechanisms may produce this bimodality. The most favored
candidate mechanisms are two distinct supernova channels or different accretion modes of the neutron
stars in Be/X-ray binaries. Investigating the kinematics of these systems may provide some additional
insight into the physics of this bimodality. If the two Be/X-ray binary subpopulations arise from
two distinct supernova types, then the two subpopulations should have different peculiar (systemic)
velocities. This can be tested either directly, by measuring the velocity of the system, or indirectly,
by measuring the position of the system with respect to its birthplace. Using the most recent Gaia
dataset and the newest catalogs of Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) star clusters, we analyzed the tangential
peculiar velocities of Be/X-ray binaries in the Galaxy and the positions of Be/X-ray binaries in
the SMC. We used the distance of the system from the nearest young star cluster as a proxy to the tangential
velocity of the system. We applied statistical testing to investigate whether the two subpopulations
that are divided by the spin of the neutron star are also kinematically distinct. There is evidence
that the two subpopulations are indeed kinematically distinct. However, the tangential peculiar
velocities of the two subpopulations are the reverse from what is expected from the distinct supernova
channel hypothesis. We find some marginal evidence ($p \approx$~0.005) that the Galactic Be/X-ray
binaries from the short-spin subpopulation have systematically higher peculiar velocities than
the systems from the long-spin subpopulation. The same effect, but weaker, is also recovered for
the SMC Be/X-ray binaries for all considered cluster catalogs.
