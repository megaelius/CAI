We initiated long-term optical interferometry monitoring of the diameters of unstable yellow
hypergiants (YHG) with the goal of detecting both the long-term evolution of their radius and shorter
term formation related to large mass-loss events. We observed HR5171 A with AMBER/VLTI. We also
examined archival photometric data in the visual and near-IR spanning more than 60 years, as well
as sparse spectroscopic data. HR5171A exhibits a complex appearance. Our AMBER data reveal a surprisingly
large star for a YHG R*=1315+/-260Rsun\ (~6.1AU) at the distance of 3.6+/-0.5kpc. The source is
surrounded by an extended nebulosity, and these data also show a large level of asymmetry in the brightness
distribution of the system, which we attribute to a newly discovered companion star located in front
of the primary star. The companion's signature is also detected in the visual photometry, which
indicates an orbital period of Porb=1304+/-6d. Modeling the light curve with the NIGHTFALL program
provides clear evidence that the system is a contact or possibly over-contact eclipsing binary.
A total current system mass of 39^{+40}_{-22} solar mass and a high mass ratio q>10 is inferred
for the system. The low-mass companion of HR5171 A is very close to the primary star that is embedded
within its dense wind. Tight constraints on the inclination and vsini of the primary are lacking,
which prevents us from determining its influence precisely on the mass-loss phenomenon, but the
system is probably experiencing a wind Roche-Lobe overflow. Depending on the amount of angular
momentum that can be transferred to the stellar envelope, HR5171 A may become a fast-rotating B[e]/Luminous
Blue Variable (LBV)/Wolf-Rayet star. In any case, HR5171 A highlights the possible importance
of binaries for interpreting the unstable YHGs and for massive star evolution in general.
