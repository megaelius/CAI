Tidal dissipation due to convective turbulent viscosity shapes the evolution of a variety of astrophysical
binaries. For example, this type of dissipation determines the rate of orbital circularization
in a binary with a post-main sequence star that is evolving toward a common envelope phase. Viscous
dissipation can also influence binaries with solar-type stars, or stars with a close-in giant planet.
In general, the effective viscosity in a convective stellar envelope depends on the tidal forcing
frequency $\omega_{\rm tide}$; when $\omega_{\rm tide}$ is larger than the turnover frequency
of convective eddies, the viscosity is reduced. Previous work has focused on binaries in nearly
circular orbits. However, for eccentric orbits, the tidal potential has many forcing frequencies.
In this paper, we develop a formalism for computing tidal dissipation that captures the effect of
frequency-dependent turbulent viscosity and is valid for arbitrary binary eccentricities. We
also present an alternative simpler formulation that is suitable for very high eccentricities.
We apply our formalisms to a red giant branch (RGB) star model and a solar-type star model. We find
that a range of pseudosynchronous rotation rates are possible for both stellar models, and the pseudosynchronous
rate can differ from the prediction of the commonly-used weak tidal friction theory by up to a factor
of a few. We also find that tidal decay and circularization due to turbulent viscosity can be a few
orders of magnitude faster than predicted by weak tidal friction in RGB stars on eccentric, small
pericentre orbits, but is suppressed by a few orders of magnitude in solar-type stars due to viscosity
reduction.
