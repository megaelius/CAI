It has been proposed that the observed systems of hot super-Earths formed in situ from high-mass
disks. By fitting a disk profile to the entire population of Kepler planet candidates, Chiang &
Laughlin (2013) constructed a "minimum-mass extrasolar nebula" with surface density profile
Sigma r^-1.6. Here we use multiple-planet systems to show that it is inconsistent to assume a universal
disk profile. Systems with 3-6 low-mass planets (or planet candidates) produce a diversity of minimum-mass
disks with surface density profiles ranging from Sigma r^-3.2 to Sigma r^0.5 (5th-95th percentile).
By simulating the transit detection of populations of synthetic planetary systems designed to
match the properties of observed super-Earth systems, we show that a universal disk profile is statistically
excluded at high confidence. Rather, the underlying distribution of minimum-mass disks is characterized
by a broad range of surface density slopes. Models of gaseous disks can only explain a narrow range
of slopes (roughly between r^0 and r^-1.5). Yet accretion of terrestrial planets in a gas-free environment
preserves the initial radial distribution of building blocks. The known systems of hot super-Earths
must therefore not represent the structure of their parent gas disks and can not have predominantly
formed in situ. We instead interpret the diversity of disk slopes as the imprint of a process that
re-arranged the solids relative to the gas in the inner parts of protoplanetary disks. A plausible
mechanism is inward type 1 migration of Mars- to Earth-mass planetary embryos, perhaps followed
by a final assembly phase.
