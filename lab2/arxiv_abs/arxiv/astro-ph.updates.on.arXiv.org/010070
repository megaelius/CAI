We present maps of atomic carbon [CI](1-0) and [CI](2-1) at a linear resolution ~1kpc scale for a
sample of one HII, six LINER, three Seyfert and five starburst galaxies observed with Herschel.
We compare spatial distributions of two [CI] lines with that of CO(1-0) emission, and find that both
[CI] lines distribute similarly to CO(1-0) emission in most galaxies. We present luminosity ratio
maps of L'_[CI](1-0)/L'_CO(1-0), L'_[CI](2-1)/L'_CO(1-0), L'_[CI](2-1)/L'_[CI](1-0) (hereafter
R_[CI]) and f_70/f_160. L'_[CI](2-1)/L'_CO(1-0), R_[CI] and f_70/f_160 are centrally peaked
in starbursts; whereas remain relatively constant in LINERs, indicating that star-forming activity
can enhance carbon emission, especially for [CI](2-1). We explore the correlations between the
luminosities of CO(1-0) and [CI] lines, and find that L'_CO(1-0) correlates tightly and almost
linearly with both L'_[CI](1-0) and L'_[CI](2-1), suggesting that [CI] lines, similar as CO(1-0),
can trace total molecular gas in our resolved galaxies on kpc scales. We investigate the dependence
of L'_[CI](1-0)/L'_CO(1-0), L'_[CI](2-1)/L'_CO(1-0) and [CI] excitation temperature T_ex
on dust temperature T_dust, and find non-correlation, a weak and modest correlation, respectively.
The ratio of L'_[CI](1-0)/L'_CO(1-0) stays smooth distribution in most galaxies, indicating
that the conversion factor of [CI](1-0) luminosity to H_2 mass (X_[CI](1-0)) changes with CO(1-0)
conversion factor (\alpha_CO) proportionally. Under optically thin and LTE assumptions, we derive
a galaxy-wide average carbon excitation temperature T_ex ~ 19.7 \pm 0.5K and an average neutral
carbon abundance X[CI]/X[H_2] ~2.5 \pm 1.0 * 10^{-5} in our resolved sample, which is comparable
to the usually adopted value of 3*10^{-5}, but ~3 times lower than the carbon abundance in local (U)LIRGs.
We conclude that the carbon abundance varies in different galaxy types.
