Self-consistent, time-dependent supernova (SN) simulations in three spatial dimensions (3D)
are conducted with the Aenus-Alcar code, comparing, for the first time, calculations with fully
multi-dimensional (FMD) neutrino transport and the ray-by-ray-plus (RbR+) approximation, both
based on a two-moment solver with algebraic M1 closure. We find good agreement between 3D results
with FMD and RbR+ transport for both tested grid resolutions in the cases of a 20 solar-mass progenitor,
which does not explode with the employed simplified set of neutrino opacities, and of an exploding
9 solar-mass model. This is in stark contrast to corresponding axisymmetric (2D) simulations,
which confirm previous claims that the RbR+ approximation can foster explosions in 2D in particular
in models with powerful axial sloshing of the stalled shock due to the standing accretion shock instability
(SASI). However, while local and instantaneous variations of neutrino fluxes and heating rates
can still be considerably higher with RbR+ transport in 3D, the time-averaged quantities are very
similar to FMD results because of the absence of a fixed, artificial symmetry axis that channels
the flow. Therefore, except for stochastic fluctuations, the neutrino signals and the post-bounce
evolution of 3D simulations with FMD and RbR+ transport are also very similar, in particular for
our calculations with the better grid resolution. Higher spatial resolution has clearly a more
important impact than the differences by the two transport treatments. Our results back up the use
of the RbR+ approximation for neutrino transport in 3D SN modeling.
