No planets exist inside the orbit of Mercury and the terrestrial planets of the solar system exhibit
a localized configuration. According to thermal structure calculation of protoplanetary disks,
a silicate condensation line (~ 1300 K) is located around 0.1 au from the Sun except for the early phase
of disk evolution, and planetesimals could have formed inside the orbit of Mercury. A recent study
of disk evolution that includes magnetically driven disk winds showed that the gas disk obtains
a positive surface density slope inside ~ 1 au from the central star. In a region with positive midplane
pressure gradient, planetesimals undergo outward radial drift. We investigate the radial drift
of planetesimals and type I migration of planetary embryos in a disk that viscously evolves with
magnetically driven disk winds. We show a case in which no planets remain in the close-in region.
Radial drifts of planetesimals are simulated using a recent disk evolution model that includes
effects of disk winds. The late stage of planet formation is also examined by performing N-body simulations
of planetary embryos. We demonstrate that in the middle stage of disk evolution, planetesimals
can undergo convergent radial drift in a magnetorotational instability (MRI)-inactive disk,
in which the pressure maximum is created, and accumulate in a narrow ring-like region with an inner
edge at ~ 0.7 au from the Sun. We also show that planetary embryos that may grow from the narrow planetesimal
ring do not exhibit significant type I migration in the late stage of disk evolution. The origin of
the localized configuration of the terrestrial planets of the solar system, in particular the deficit
of close-in planets, can be explained by the convergent radial drift of planetesimals in disks with
a positive pressure gradient in the close-in region.
