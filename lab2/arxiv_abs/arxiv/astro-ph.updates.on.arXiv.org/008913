Microlenses with typical stellar masses (a few ${\rm M}_{\odot}$) have traditionally been disregarded
as potential sources of gravitational lensing effects at LIGO/Virgo frequencies, since the time
delays are often much smaller than the inverse of the frequencies probed by LIGO/Virgo, resulting
in negligible interference effects at LIGO/Virgo frequencies. While this is true for isolated
microlenses in this mass regime, we show how, under certain circumstances and for realistic scenarios,
a population of microlenses (for instance stars and remnants from a galaxy halo or from the intracluster
medium) embedded in a macromodel potential (galaxy or cluster) can conspire together to produce
time delays of order one millisecond which would produce significant interference distortions
in the observed strains. At sufficiently large magnification factors (of several hundred), microlensing
effects should be common in gravitationally lensed gravitational waves. We explore the regime
where the predicted signal falls in the frequency range probed by LIGO/Virgo. We find that stellar
mass microlenses, permeating the lens plane, and near critical curves, can introduce interference
distortions in strongly lensed gravitational waves. For those lensed events with negative parity,
(or saddle points, never studied before in the context of gravitational waves), and that take place
near caustics of macromodels, they are more likely to produce measurable interference effects
at LIGO/Virgo frequencies. This is the first study that explores the effect of a realistic population
of microlenses, plus a macromodel, on strongly lensed gravitational waves.
