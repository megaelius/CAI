The streaming model describes the mapping between real and redshift space for 2-point clustering
statistics. Its key element is the probability density function (PDF) of line-of-sight pairwise
peculiar velocities. Following a kinetic-theory approach, we derive the fundamental equations
of the streaming model for ordered and unordered pairs. In the first case, we recover the classic
equation while we demonstrate that modifications are necessary for unordered pairs. The difference
originates from pairs that reverse their line-of-sight ordering between real and redshift space
with respect to the observer. Our non-perturbative results are exact in the distant-observer approximation
and hold true also in the presence of multi streaming. We clarify some ambiguity in the literature
by showing that different pairwise-velocity PDFs should be employed for ordered and unordered
pairs. We then discuss several statistical properties of the pairwise velocities also using a high-resolution
N-body simulation. Finally, we introduce a mixture of Gaussians which is known in statistics as
the generalised hyperbolic distribution and show that it provides an accurate fit to the PDF of pairwise
velocities. Once inserted in the streaming equation, the fit yields an excellent description of
redshift-space correlations at all scales that vastly outperforms the commonly used Gaussian
and exponential approximations. Using a principal-component analysis, we reduce the complexity
of our model for large redshift-space separations. Our results are useful for extending studies
of anisotropic galaxy clustering towards smaller scales in order to test theories of gravity and
interacting dark-energy models.
