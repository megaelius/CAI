With the availability of parallaxes provided by the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution, it is possible
to construct the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD) of barium and related stars with unprecedented
accuracy. A direct result from the derived HRD is that subgiant CH stars occupy the same region as
barium dwarfs, contrary to what their designations imply. By comparing the position of barium stars
in the HRD with STAREVOL evolutionary tracks, it is possible to evaluate their masses, provided
the metallicity is known. We used an average metallicity [Fe/H] = -0.25 and derived the mass distribution
of barium giants. The distribution peaks around 2.5 Msun with a tail at higher masses up to 4.5 Msun.
This peak is also seen in the mass distribution of a sample of normal K and M giants used for comparison
and is associated with stars located in the red clump. When we compare these mass distributions,
we see a deficit of low-mass (1 - 2 Msun) barium giants. This is probably because low-mass stars reach
large radii at the tip of the red giant branch, which may have resulted in an early binary interaction.
Among barium giants, the high-mass tail is however dominated by stars with barium indices of less
than unity, based on a visual inspection of the barium spectral line; that is, these stars have a very
moderate barium line strength. We believe that these stars are not genuine barium giants, but rather
bright giants, or supergiants, where the barium lines are strengthened because of a positive luminosity
effect. Moreover, contrary to previous claims, we do not see differences between the mass distributions
of mild and strong barium giants.
