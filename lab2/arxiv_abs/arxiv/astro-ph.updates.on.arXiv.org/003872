We report the study of the far-IR sizes of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in relation to their dust-obscured
star formation rate (SFR) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity, as diagnosed using mid-IR
photometry. We determined the millimeter-wave ($\lambda_{\rm obs}=1100 \mu$m) sizes of 69 ALMA-identified
SMGs, selected above a threshold of $\geq10$$\sigma$ in ALMA images ($F_{\rm 1100 \mu m}=1.7$--7.4
mJy). We found that all of the SMGs are located above an avoidance region in the size-flux plane, $D$
(FWHM, arcsec) $\gtrsim 0.057\times F_{\rm 1100 \mu m}$ (mJy), which corresponds to the Eddington
limit for star formation. In order to study what drives the different millimeter-wave sizes in SMGs,
we studied a relation between millimeter-wave size and AGN fraction for 25 SMGs at $z=1$--3. We found
that the SMGs where the mid-IR emission is dominated by star formation have a median size, $R_{\rm
c,e} = 1.6^{+0.33}_{-0.22}$ kpc, whereas SMGs where the mid-IR emission is contributed by AGN a
median $R_{\rm c,e} = 1.1^{+0.36}_{-0.23}$ kpc. Furthermore, when we divide the SMGs with an AGN
component evident in their mid-IR light into AGN-dominant and composite types, all the composite
galaxies are compact (median $R_{\rm c,e} = 1.0^{+0.18}_{-0.20}$ kpc), whereas those with dominant
AGNs have a median $R_{\rm c,e} = 1.5^{+0.98}_{-0.33}$ kpc. This relation between millimeter-wave
sizes and AGN fraction in mid-IR light suggests that millimeter-wave size may be related to the evolutionary
stage of a starburst galaxy. The very compact sizes for composite star-forming/AGN SMGs suggest
that a supermassive black hole grows rapidly during the coalescing, star-forming phase of an SMG.
