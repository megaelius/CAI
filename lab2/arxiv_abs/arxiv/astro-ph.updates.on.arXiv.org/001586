Kepler has identified over 600 multiplanet systems, many of which have several planets with orbital
distances smaller than that of Mercury -- quite different from the Solar System. Because these systems
may be difficult to explain in the paradigm of core accretion and disk migration, it has been suggested
that they formed in situ within protoplanetary disks with high solid surface densities. The strong
connection between giant planet occurrence and stellar metallicity is thought to be linked to enhanced
solid surface densities in disks around metal-rich stars, so the presence of a giant planet can be
a detectable sign of planet formation in a high solid surface density disk. I formulate quantitative
predictions for the frequency of long-period giant planets in these in situ models of planet formation
by translating the proposed increase in disk mass into an equivalent metallicity enhancement.
I rederive the scaling of giant planet occurrence with metallicity as P_gp = 0.05_{-0.02}^{+0.02}
x 10^{(2.1 +/- 0.4) [M/H]} = 0.08_{-0.03}^{+0.02} x 10^{(2.3 +/- 0.4) [Fe/H]} and show that there
is significant tension between the frequency of giant planets suggested by the minimum mass extrasolar
nebula scenario and the observational upper limits. This fact suggests that high-mass disks alone
cannot explain the observed properties of the close-in Kepler multiplanet systems and that migration
is still a necessary contributor to their formation. More speculatively, I combine the metallicity
scaling of giant planet occurrence with recently published small planet occurrence rates to estimate
the number of Solar System analogs in the Galaxy. I find that in the Milky Way there are perhaps 4 x 10^6
true Solar System analogs with an FGK star hosting both a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone
and a long-period giant planet companion.
