We investigate the differential effects of metal cooling and galactic stellar winds on the cosmological
formation of individual galaxies with three sets of cosmological, hydrodynamical zoom simulations
of 45 halos in the mass range 10^11<M_halo<10^13M_sun. Models including both galactic winds
and metal cooling (i) suppress early star formation at z>1 and predict reasonable star formation
histories, (ii) produce galaxies with high cold gas fractions (30-60 per cent) at high redshift,
(iii) significantly reduce the galaxy formation efficiencies for halos (M_halo<10^12M_sun)
at all redshifts in agreement with observational and abundance matching constraints, (iv) result
in high-redshift galaxies with reduced circular velocities matching the observed Tully-Fisher
relation at z~2, and (v) significantly increase the sizes of low-mass galaxies (M_stellar<3x10^10M_sun)
at high redshift resulting in a weak size evolution - a trend in agreement with observations. However,
the low redshift (z<0.5) star formation rates of massive galaxies are higher than observed (up
to ten times). No tested model predicts the observed size evolution for low-mass and high-mass galaxies
simultaneously. Due to the delayed onset of star formation in the wind models, the metal enrichment
of gas and stars is delayed and agrees well with observational constraints. Metal cooling and stellar
winds are both found to increase the ratio of in situ formed to accreted stars - the relative importance
of dissipative vs. dissipationless assembly. For halo masses below ~10^12M_sun, this is mainly
caused by less stellar accretion and compares well to predictions from semi-analytical models
but still differs from abundance matching models. For higher masses, the fraction of in situ stars
is over-predicted due to the unrealistically high star formation rates at low redshifts.
