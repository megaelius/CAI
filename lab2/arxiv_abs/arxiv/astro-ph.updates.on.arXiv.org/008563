We present a morphological classification of 14,245 radio active galactic nuclei (AGNs) into six
types, i.e., typical Fanaroff--Riley Class I / II (FRI/II), FRI/II-like bent-tailed, X-shaped
radio galaxy, and ringlike radio galaxy, by designing a convolutional neural network (CNN) based
autoencoder, namely MCRGNet, and applying it to a labeled radio galaxy (LRG) sample containing
1442 AGNs and an unlabeled radio galaxy (unLRG) sample containing 14,245 unlabeled AGNs selected
from the Best--Heckman sample. We train MCRGNet and implement the classification task by a three-step
strategy, i.e., pre-training, fine-tuning, and classification, which combines both unsupervised
and supervised learnings. A four-layer dichotomous tree is designed to classify the radio AGNs,
which leads to a significantly better performance than the direct six-type classification. On
the LRG sample, our MCRGNet achieves a total precision of $\sim 93\%$ and an averaged sensitivity
of $\sim 87\%$, which are better than those obtained in previous works. On the unLRG sample, whose
labels have been human-inspected, the neural network achieves a total precision of $\sim 80\%$.
Also, using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7) to calculate the $r$-band absolute
magnitude ($M_\mathrm{opt}$) and using the flux densities to calculate the radio luminosity ($L_\mathrm{radio}$),
we find that the distributions of the unLRG sources on the $L_\mathrm{radio}$--$M_\mathrm{opt}$
plane do not show an apparent redshift evolution and could confirm with a sufficiently large sample
that there could not exist an abrupt separation between FRIs and FRIIs as reported in some previous
works.
