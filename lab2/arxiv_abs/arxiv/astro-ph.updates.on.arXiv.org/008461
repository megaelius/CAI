We investigate the effect on the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) from the presence of a stochastic
primordial magnetic field (PMF) whose strength is spatially inhomogeneous. We assume a uniform
total energy density and a gaussian distribution of field strength. In this case, domains of different
temperatures exist in the BBN epoch due to variations in the local PMF. We show that in such case, the
effective distribution function of particle velocities averaged over domains of different temperatures
deviates from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. This deviation is related to the scale invariant
strength of the PMF energy density $\rho_{\rm Bc}$ and the fluctuation parameter $\sigma_{\rm
B}$. We perform BBN network calculations taking into account the PMF strength distribution, and
deduce the element abundances as functions of the baryon-to-photon ratio $\eta$, $\rho_{\rm Bc}$,
and $\sigma_{\rm B}$. We find that the fluctuations of the PMF reduces the $^7$Be production and
enhances D production. We analyze the averaged thermonuclear reaction rates compared with those
of a single temperature, and find that the averaged charged-particle reaction rates are very different.
Finally, we constrain the parameters $\rho_{\rm Bc}$ and $\sigma_{\rm B}$ from observed abundances
of $^4$He and D, and find that the $^7$Li abundance is significantly reduced. We also find that if
the $\eta$ value during BBN was larger than the present-day value due to a dissipation of the PMF or
a radiative decay of exotic particles after BBN or if the stellar depletion of $^7$Li occurred, abundances
of all light elements can be consistent with observational constraints.
