By making use of Herschel-PEP observations of the COSMOS and Extended Groth Strip fields, we have
estimated the dependence of the clustering properties of FIR-selected sources on their 100um fluxes.
Our analysis shows a tendency for the clustering strength to decrease with limiting fluxes: r0(S100um
>8 mJy)~4.3 Mpc and r0(S100um >5 mJy)~5.8 Mpc. These values convert into minimum halo masses
Mmin~10^{11.6} Msun for sources brighter than 8 mJy and Mmin~10^{12.4} Msun for S100um > 5 mJy
galaxies. We show such an increase of the clustering strength to be due to an intervening population
of z~2 sources, which are very strongly clustered and whose relative contribution, equal to about
10% of the total counts at S100um > 2 mJy, rapidly decreases for brighter flux cuts. By removing
such a contribution, we find that z <~ 1 FIR galaxies have approximately the same clustering properties,
irrespective of their flux level. The above results were then used to investigate the intrinsic
dependence on cosmic epoch of the clustering strength of dusty star-forming galaxies between z~0
and z~2.5. In order to remove any bias in the selection process, the adopted sample only includes
galaxies observed at the same rest-frame wavelength, lambda~60 um, which have comparable luminosities
and therefore star-formation rates (SFR>~100 Msun/yr). Our analysis shows that the same amount
of (intense) star forming activity takes place in extremely different environments at the different
cosmological epochs. For z<~1 the hosts of such star forming systems are small, Mmin~10^{11}
Msun, isolated galaxies. High (z~2) redshift star formation instead seems to uniquely take place
in extremely massive/cluster-like halos, Mmin~10^{13.5} Msun, which are associated with the
highest peaks of the density fluctuation field at those epochs. (abridged)
