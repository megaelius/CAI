We report multi-wavelength monitoring observations of an M-dwarf flare star AD Leonis with Seimei
Telescope (6150--7930 {\AA}), SCAT (Spectroscopic Chuo-university Astronomical Telescope;
3700--7500 {\AA}), NICER (Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer; 0.2--12.0 keV), and collaborations
of OISTER (Optical and Infrared Synergetic Telescopes for Education and Research) program. Twelve
flares are detected in total which include ten H$\alpha$, four X-ray, and four optical-continuum
flares; one of them is a superflare with the total energy of $\sim$ 2.0$\times$10$^{33}$ erg. We
found that (1) during the superflare, the H$\alpha$ emission line full width at 1/8 maximum dramatically
increases to 14 {\AA} from 8 {\AA} in the low-resolution spectra (R$\sim$ 2000) accompanied with
the large white-light flares, (2) some weak H$\alpha$/X-ray flares are not accompanied with white-light
emissions, and (3) the non-flaring emissions show clear rotational modulations in X-ray and H$\alpha$
intensity in the same phase. To understand these observational features, one-dimensional hydrodynamic
flare simulations are performed by using the RADYN code. As a result of simulations, we found the
simulated H$\alpha$ line profiles with hard and high-energy non-thermal electron beams are consistent
with that of the initial phase line profiles of the superflares, while those with more soft- and/or
weak-energy beam are consistent with those in decay phases, indicating the changes in the energy
fluxes injected to the lower atmosphere. Also, we found that the relation between optical continuum
and H$\alpha$ intensity is nonlinear, which can be one cause of the non-white-light flares. The
flare energy budget exhibits diversity in the observations and models, and more observations of
stellar flares are necessary for constraining the occurrence of various emission line phenomena
in stellar flares.
