Meteorites with known orbital origins are key to our understanding of Solar System formation and
the source of life on Earth. However, these pristine samples of space material are incredibly rare.
Less than 40 of the 60,000 meteorites held in collections around the world have known dynamical origins.
Fireball networks have been developed globally in a unified effort to increase this number by using
multiple observatories to record, triangulate, and dynamically analyse ablating meteoroids
as they enter our atmosphere. The accuracy of the chosen meteoroid triangulation method directly
influences the accuracy of the determined orbit and the likelihood of possible meteorite recovery.
There are three leading techniques for meteoroid triangulation discussed in the literature: the
Method of Planes, the Straight Line Least Squares method, and the Multi-Parameter Fit method. Here
we describe an alternative method to meteoroid triangulation, called the Dynamic Trajectory Fit.
This approach uses the meteoroid's 3D dynamic equations of motion to fit a realistic trajectory
directly to multi-sensor line-of-sight observations. This method has the ability to resolve fragmentation
events, fit systematic observatory timing offsets, and determine mass estimates of the meteoroid
along its observable trajectory. Through a comprehensive Monte-Carlo analysis of over 100,000
trajectory simulations, we find this new method to more accurately estimate meteoroid trajectories
of slow entry events ($<$25\,km/s) and events observed from low convergence angles ($<$10$^{\circ}$)
compared to existing meteoroid triangulation techniques. Additionally, we triangulate an observed
fireball event with visible fragmentation using the various triangulation methods to show that
the proposed Dynamic Trajectory Fit implementing fragmentation to best match the captured multi-sensor
line-of-sight data.
