Abridged. Our aim is to measure the masses and radii of the stars in a newly-discovered detached eclipsing
binary system to a high precision ($\approx$1%), enabling the system to be used for the calibration
of free parameters in stellar evolutionary models. Photometry from the Wide Angle Search for Planets
(WASP) project was used to identify 1SWASP J063930.33-322404.8 (TYC 7091-888-1, WASP 0369-32
hereafter) as a detached eclipsing binary system with total eclipses and an orbital period of P=11.66
days. Lightcurve parameters for WASP 0639-32 are obtained using the ebop lightcurve model, with
standard errors evaluated using a prayer-bead algorithm. Radial velocities were measured from
11 high-resolution spectra using a broadening function approach, and an orbit was fitted using
sbop. Observed spectra were disentangled and an equivalent width fitting method was used to obtain
effective temperatures and metallicities for both stars. A Bayesian framework is used to explore
a grid of stellar evolution models, where both helium abundance and mixing length are free to vary,
and use observed parameters (mass, density, temperature and metallicity) for each star to obtain
the age and constrain the helium abundance of the system. The masses and radii are found to be $M_{1}=1.1544\pm0.0043\,M_{\odot}$,
$R_{1}=1.833\pm0.023\,R_{\odot}$ and $M_{2}=0.7833\pm0.0028\,M_{\odot}$, $R_{2}=0.7286\pm0.0081\,R_{\odot}$
for the primary and secondary, respectively. The effective temperatures were found to be $T_{1}=6330\pm50$
K and $T_{2}=5400\pm80$ K for the primary and secondary star, respectively. The system has an age
of $4.2^{+0.8}_{-0.1}$ Gyr, and a helium abundance in the range 0.251-0.271. WASP 0639-32 is a rare
example of a well-characterised detached eclipsing binary system containing a star near the main-sequence
turn-off point. This make it possible to measure a precise age for the stars ...
