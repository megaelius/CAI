Galaxy mergers are capable of triggering both star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN) and
therefore may represent an important pathway in the co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive
black holes (SMBHs). However, correlated enhancements of merger-induced star formation and AGN
triggering may be hidden by the variable conditions and timescales during which they occur. In Paper
I, we presented evidence of merger-triggered AGN in a sample of six late-stage galaxy mergers (2-8
kpc nuclear separations). In this follow-up work, we use multi-wavelength Hubble Space Telescope
imaging and additional archival data to examine their star-forming properties to test for merger-triggered
star formation, and if it is correlated with SMBH growth. We find that the morphological asymmetries
are correlated with enhanced specific star formation rates, indicating the presence of merger-triggered
star formation. Additionally, the stellar populations become younger with increasing radius
from the nucleus, indicating that the merger-induced star formation primarily occurs on global
scales. However, we also find that the star formation rate enhancements are consistent with or lower
than those of larger separation galaxy pair samples. This result is consistent with simulations
predicting a decline of the global star formation rates in late-stage galaxy mergers with <10 kpc
nuclear separations. Finally, we find that enhancements in specific star formation rate and AGN
luminosity are positively correlated, but that an average temporal delay of >10^8 yrs likely exists
between the peak of global star formation and the onset of AGN triggering in 80% of the systems.
