Context. In 2015, Barman et al. (ApJ, 804, 61) presented detections of absorption from water, carbon
monoxide, and methane in the atmosphere of the directly imaged exoplanet HR8799b using integral
field spectroscopy (IFS) with OSIRIS on the Keck II telescope. We recently devised a new method to
analyse IFU data, called molecule mapping, searching for high-frequency signatures of particular
molecules in an IFU data cube. Aims. The aim of this paper is to use the molecule mapping technique
to search for the previously detected spectral signatures in HR8799b using the same data, allowing
a comparison of molecule mapping with previous methods. Methods. The medium-resolution H- and
K-band pipeline-reduced archival data were retrieved from the Keck archive facility. Telluric
and stellar lines were removed from each spectrum in the data cube, after which the residuals were
cross-correlated with model spectra of carbon monoxide, water, and methane. Results. Both carbon
monoxide and water are clearly detected at high signal-to-noise, however, methane is not retrieved.
Conclusions. Molecule mapping works very well on the OSIRIS data of exoplanet HR8799b. However,
it is not evident why methane is detected in the original analysis, but not with the molecule mapping
technique. Possible causes could be the presence of telluric residuals, different spectral filtering
techniques, or the use of different methane models. We do note that in the original analysis methane
was only detected in the K-band, while the H-band methane signal could be expected to be comparably
strong. More sensitive observations with the JWST will be capable of confirming or disproving the
presence of methane in this planet at high confidence.
