We report a 72 ks XMM-Newton observation of the Be/X-ray pulsar (BeXRP) RX J0812.4-3114 in quiescence
($L_X \approx 1.6 \times 10^{33}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$). Intriguingly, we find a two component
spectrum, with a hard power-law ($\Gamma \approx 1.5$) and a soft blackbody-like excess below $\approx
1~\mathrm{keV}$. The blackbody component is consistent in $kT$ with a prior quiescent Chandra
observation reported by Tsygankov et al. and has an inferred blackbody radius of $\approx 10~\mathrm{km}$,
consistent with emission from the entire neutron star (NS) surface. There is also mild evidence
for an absorption line at $\approx 1~\mathrm{keV}$ and/or $\approx 1.4~\mathrm{keV}$. The hard
component shows pulsations at $P \approx 31.908~\mathrm{s}$ (pulsed fraction $0.84 \pm 0.10$),
agreeing with the pulse period seen previously in outbursts, but no pulsations were found in the
soft excess (pulsed fraction $\lesssim 31\%$). We conclude that the pulsed hard component suggests
low-level accretion onto the neutron star poles, while the soft excess seems to originate from the
entire NS surface. We speculate that, in quiescence, the source switches between a soft thermal-dominated
state (when the propeller effect is at work) and a relatively hard state with low-level accretion,
and use the propeller cutoff to estimate the magnetic field of the system to be $\lesssim 8.4 \times
10^{11}~\mathrm{G}$. We compare the quiescent thermal $L_X$ predicted by the standard deep crustal
heating model to our observations and find that RX J0812.4-3114 has a high thermal $L_X$, at or above
the prediction for minimum cooling mechanisms. This suggests that RX J0812.4-3114 either contains
a relatively low-mass NS with minimum cooling, or that the system may be young enough that the NS has
not fully cooled from the supernova explosion.
