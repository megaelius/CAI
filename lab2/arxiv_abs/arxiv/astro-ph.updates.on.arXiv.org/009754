Coalescing massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) of $10^{4-7} \rm M_{\odot}$, forming in the aftermath
of galaxy mergers, are primary targets of the space mission LISA, the {\it Laser Interferometer
Space Antenna}. An assessment of LISA detection prospects requires an estimate of the abundance
and properties of MBHBs that form and evolve during the assembly of cosmic structures. To this aim,
we employ a semi-analytic model to follow the co-evolution of MBHBs within their host galaxies.
We identify three major evolutionary channels driving the binaries to coalescence: two standard
paths along which the binary evolution is driven by interactions with the stellar and/or gaseous
environment, and a novel channel where MBHB coalescence occurs during the interaction with a third
black hole. For each channel, we follow the orbital evolution of MBHBs with physically motivated
models that include a self-consistent treatment of the orbital eccentricity. We find that LISA
will detect between $\approx 25$ and $\approx 75$ events per year depending on the seed model. We
show that triple-induced coalescences can range from a few detected events up to $\sim 30\%$ of the
total detected mergers. Moreover, even if the standard gas/stars-driven evolutionary channels
should fail and MBHBs were to stall, triple interactions would still occur as a result of the hierarchical
nature of galaxy formation, resulting in about $\approx 10$ to $\approx 20$ LISA detections per
year. Remarkably, triple interactions among the black holes can produce coalescing binaries with
large eccentricities ($\gtrsim 0.9$) upon entrance into the LISA band. This eccentricity will
remain significant ($\sim 0.1$) also at merger, requiring suitable templates for parameter estimation.
