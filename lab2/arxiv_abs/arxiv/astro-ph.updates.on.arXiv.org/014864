We make an in-depth comparison of the IllustrisTNG simulations with observational data on the quenched
fractions of central and satellite galaxies, for $M_*=10^{9-12}M_{\odot}$ at $0\leq z\leq3$.
We study how analysis methodologies and observational effects impact this comparison. This includes
measurement choices -- aperture, quenched definition, star formation rate (SFR) indicator timescale
-- as well as observational uncertainties and sample selection issues: projection effects, satellite/central
misclassification, and host mass distribution sampling. The definition used to separate quenched
and star-forming galaxies produces differences of up to 70 (30)$\%$ for centrals (satellites)
$>\sim 10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$. Increasing the aperture within which SFR is measured can suppress
the quenched fractions by up to $\sim50\%$, particularly at $z\gtrsim2$. Proper consideration
of the stellar and host mass distributions is crucial: naive comparisons to volume-limited samples
from simulations lead to misinterpretation of the quenched fractions as a function of $z$ by up to
20$\%$. Including observational uncertainties to theoretical values of $M_*$ and SFR changes
the quenched fraction values and their trend and/or slope with mass. Taking projected rather than
3D distances for satellites decreases the quenched fractions by up to 10$\%$ due to field contamination.
Comparing with data, TNG produces quenched fractions broadly consistent with observations. TNG
predicts quenched fractions up to $\sim80-90\%$ for centrals at $z\leq2-3$, in line with recent
observations, and notably higher than other theoretical models. The quantitative agreement of
TNG and SDSS for satellite quenched fractions in groups and clusters depends strongly on the galaxy
and host mass range. Our mock comparison between TNG and SDSS highlights the importance of properly
accounting for observational effects and biases.
