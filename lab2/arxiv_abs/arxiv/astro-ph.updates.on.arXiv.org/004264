Previous studies have shown that our velocity in the rest frame of galaxies at high redshift does
not converge to that deduced from the CMB temperature-dipole anisotropy. In this work we determine
the dipole in the galaxy catalogue derived from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)
survey. After reducing star contamination to ~0.1% by rejecting sources with high apparent motion
as well as those close to the Galactic plane, we eliminate low redshift sources in order to suppress
the non-kinematic, clustering dipole. We remove sources near the super-galactic plane, and those
which are within 1'' of 2Mass Redshift Survey (2MRS) sources at z<0.03. We enforce cuts on the angular
extent of the sources to preferentially select distant ones. As we progress along these steps, the
dipole converges in direction towards that of the CMB, ending up within 5{\deg} of it. Its magnitude
also progressively reduces as nearby structures are removed but stabilises at ~0.012, corresponding
to a velocity >1000 km/s, if it is solely of kinematic origin. However, previous studies have shown
that only ~70% of the velocity of the Local Group as inferred from the CMB dipole is due to sources at
z<0.03. We examine the Dark Sky simulations to quantify the prevalence of such environments and
find that <3.1% of Milky Way-like observers in a {\Lambda}CDM universe should observe the bulk flow
(>240 km/s extending beyond z=0.03) that we do. We construct mock catalogues from the Dark Sky simulations
in the neighbourhood of such peculiar observers in order to mimic our final galaxy selection, and
quantify the residual clustering dipole. After subtracting this the remaining dipole is 0.0048+/-0.0022,
corresponding to a velocity of 430+/-197 km/s which is consistent with the CMB. However the cause
of such a large clustering dipole, the sources of which are at z>0.03, remains to be established.
