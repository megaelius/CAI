Context. The nature of the recently identified "sdA" spectroscopic class of star is not well understood.
The thousands of known sdAs have H-dominated spectra, spectroscopic surface gravities intermediate
to main sequence stars and isolated white dwarfs, and effective temperatures below the lower limit
for He-burning subdwarfs. Most are likely products of binary stellar evolution, whether extremely
low-mass white dwarfs and their precursors, or blue stragglers in the halo. Aims. Stellar eigenfrequencies
revealed through time series photometry of pulsating stars sensitively probe stellar structural
properties. The properties of pulsations exhibited by any sdA stars would contribute importantly
to our developing understanding of this class. Methods. We extend our photometric campaign to discover
pulsating extremely low-mass white dwarfs from McDonald Observatory to target sdA stars classified
from SDSS spectra. We also obtain follow-up time series spectroscopy to search for binary signatures
from four new pulsators. Results. Out of 23 sdA stars observed, we clearly detect stellar pulsations
in seven. Dominant pulsation periods range from 4.6 minutes to 12.3 hours, with most on ~hour timescales.
We argue specific classifications for some of the new variables, identifying both compact and likely
main sequence dwarf pulsators, along with a candidate low-mass RR Lyrae star. Conclusions. With
dominant pulsation periods spanning orders of magnitude, the pulsational evidence supports the
emerging narrative that the sdA class consists of multiple stellar populations. Since multiple
types of sdA exhibit stellar pulsations, follow-up asteroseismic analysis can be used to probe
the precise evolutionary natures and stellar structures of these individual subpopulations.
