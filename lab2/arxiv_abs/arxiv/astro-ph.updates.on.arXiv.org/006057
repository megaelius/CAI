We present the observations of a double-decker filament to study its formation, triggering, and
eruption physics. It is observed that the double-decker filament was formed by splitting of an original
single filament. During the splitting process, intermittent bright point bursts are observed
in the filament channel, which resulted in the generation of the upper filament branch. The eruption
of the newly formed double-decker filament was possibly triggered by two recurrent two-sided loop
jets in the filament channel and the continuous mass unloading from the upper filament body. The
interaction between the first jet and the filament directly resulted in the unstable of the lower
branch and the fast rising phase of the upper branch. The second jet occurred at the same site about
three hours after the first one, which further disturbed and accelerated the rising of the lower
filament branch. It is interesting that the rising lower branch overtook the upper one, and then
the two branches probably merged into one filament. Finally, the whole filament erupted violently
and caused a large-scale coronal mass ejection, leaving behind a pair of flare ribbons and two dimming
regions on the both sides of the filament channel. We think that the intermittent bursts may directly
result in the rearrangement of the filament magnetic field and therefore the formation of the double-decker
filament, then the recurrent jets further caused the fully eruption of the entire filament system.
The study provides convincing evidence for supporting the scenario that a double-decker filament
can be formed by splitting a single filament into two branches.
