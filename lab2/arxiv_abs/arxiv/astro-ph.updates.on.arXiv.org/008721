Super-Earths are found in tighter orbits than the Earth's around more than one third of main sequence
stars. It has been proposed that super-Earths are scaled-up terrestrial planets that formed similarly,
through mutual accretion of planetary embryos, but in discs much denser than the solar protoplanetary
disc. We argue instead that terrestrial planets and super-Earths have two distinct formation pathways
that are regulated by the disc's pebble reservoir. Through numerical integrations, which combine
pebble accretion and N-body gravity between embryos, we show that a difference of a factor of two
in the pebble mass-flux is enough to change the evolution from the terrestrial to the super-Earth
growth mode. If the pebble mass-flux is small, then the initial embryos within the ice line grow slowly
and do not migrate substantially, resulting in a widely spaced population of Mars-mass embryos
when the gas disc dissipates. Without gas being present, the embryos become unstable and a small
number of terrestrial planets are formed by mutual collisions. The final terrestrial planets are
at most 5 Earth masses. Instead, if the pebble mass-flux is high, then the initial embryos within
the ice line rapidly become sufficiently massive to migrate through the gas disc. Embryos concentrate
at the inner edge of the disc and growth accelerates through mutual merging. This leads to the formation
of a system of closely spaced super-Earths in the 5 to 20 Earth-mass range, bounded by the pebble isolation
mass. Generally, instabilities of these super-Earth systems after the disappearance of the gas
disc trigger additional merging events and dislodge the system from resonant chains. The pebble
flux - which controls the transition between the two growth modes - may be regulated by the initial
reservoir of solids in the disc or the presence of more distant giant planets that can halt the radial
flow of pebbles.
