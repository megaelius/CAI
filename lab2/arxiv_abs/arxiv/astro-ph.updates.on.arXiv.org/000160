A forward amplitude analysis on $pp$ and $\bar{p}p$ elastic scattering above 5 GeV is presented.
The dataset includes the recent high-precision TOTEM measurements of the $pp$ total and elastic
(integrated) cross-sections at 7 and 8 TeV. Following previous works, the leading high-energy
contribution for the total cross-section ($\sigma_{tot}$) is parametrized as $\ln^{\gamma}(s/s_h)$,
where $\gamma$ and $s_h$ are free \textit{real} fit parameters. Singly-subtracted derivative
dispersion relations are used to connect $\sigma_{tot}$ and the rho parameter ($\rho$) in an analytical
way. Different fit procedures are considered, including individual fits to $\sigma_{tot}$ data,
global fits to $\sigma_{tot}$ and $\rho$ data, constrained and unconstrained data reductions.
The results favor a rise of the $\sigma_{tot}$ faster than the log-squared bound by Froissart and
Martin at the LHC energy region. The parametrization for $\sigma_{tot}$ is extended to fit the elastic
cross-section ($\sigma_{el}$) data with satisfactory results. The analysis indicates an asymptotic
ratio $\sigma_{el}/\sigma_{tot}$ consistent with 1/3 (as already obtained in a previous work).
A critical discussion on the correlation, practical role and physical implications of the parameters
$\gamma$ and $s_h$ is presented. The discussion confronts the 2002 prediction of $\sigma_{tot}$
by the COMPETE Collaboration and the recent result by the Particle Data Group (2012 edition of the
Review of Particle Physics). Some conjectures on possible implications of a fast rise of the proton
total cross-section at the highest energies are also presented.
