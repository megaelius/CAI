It is not yet known if the properties of molecular gas in distant protocluster galaxies are significantly
affected by their environment as galaxies are in local clusters. Through a deep, 64 hours of effective
on-source integration with the Australian Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), we discovered a massive,
M_mol=2.0+-0.2x10^11 M_sun, extended, ~40 kpc, CO(1-0)-emitting disk in the protocluster surrounding
the radio galaxy, MRC1138-262. The galaxy, at z_CO=2.1478, is a clumpy, massive disk galaxy, M_star~5x10^11
M_sun, which lies 250 kpc in projection from MRC1138-262 and is a known H-alpha emitter, HAE229.
HAE229 has a molecular gas fraction of ~30%. The CO emission has a kinematic gradient along its major
axis, centered on the highest surface brightness rest-frame optical emission, consistent with
HAE229 being a rotating disk. Surprisingly, a significant fraction of the CO emission lies outside
of the UV/optical emission. In spite of this, HAE229 follows the same relation between star-formation
rate and molecular gas mass as normal field galaxies. HAE229 is the first CO(1-0) detection of an
ordinary, star-forming galaxy in a protocluster. We compare a sample of cluster members at z>0.4
that are detected in low-order CO transitions with a similar sample of sources drawn from the field.
We confirm findings that the CO-luminosity and FWHM are correlated in starbursts and show that this
relation is valid for normal high-z galaxies as well as those in overdensities. We do not find a clear
dichotomy in the integrated Schmidt-Kennicutt relation for protocluster and field galaxies.
Not finding any environmental dependence in the "star-formation efficiency" or the molecular
gas content, especially for such an extended CO disk, suggests that environmentally-specific
processes such as ram pressure stripping are not operating efficiently in (proto)clusters. (abridged)
