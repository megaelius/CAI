The Orion Molecular Cloud is the nearest massive-star forming region. Massive stars have profound
effects on their environment due to their strong radiation fields and stellar winds. Velocity-resolved
observations of the [CII] $158\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ fine-structure line allow us to study the kinematics
of UV-illuminated gas. Here, we present a square-degree-sized map of [CII] emission from the Orion
Nebula complex obtained by the upGREAT instrument onboard SOFIA, covering the entire Orion Nebula
(M42) plus M43 and the nebulae NGC 1973, 1975, and 1977. We compare the stellar characteristics of
these three regions with the kinematics of the expanding bubbles surrounding them. The bubble blown
by the O7V star $\theta^1$ Ori C in the Orion Nebula expands rapidly, at $13\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$.
Simple analytical models reproduce the characteristics of the hot interior gas and the neutral
shell of this wind-blown bubble and give us an estimate of the expansion time of $0.2\,\mathrm{Myr}$.
M43 with the B0.5V star NU Ori also exhibits an expanding bubble structure, with an expansion velocity
of $6\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Comparison with analytical models for the pressure-driven expansion
of H\,{\sc ii} regions gives an age estimate of $0.02\,\mathrm{Myr}$. The bubble surrounding NGC
1973, 1975, and 1977 with the central B1V star 42 Orionis expands at $1.5\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$,
likely due to the over-pressurized ionized gas as in the case of M43. We derive an age of $0.4\,\mathrm{Myr}$
for this structure. We conclude that the bubble of the Orion Nebula is driven by the mechanical energy
input by the strong stellar wind from $\theta^1$ Ori C, while the bubbles associated with M43 and
NGC 1977 are caused by the thermal expansion of the gas ionized by their central later-type massive
stars.
