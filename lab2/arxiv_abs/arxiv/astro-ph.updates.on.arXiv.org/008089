We studied the Class I protostar 2MASS 22352345+7517076 whose dramatic brightening between the
IRAS, Akari, and WISE surveys was reported by Onozato et al. (2015). 2MASS 22352345+7517076 is a
member of a small group of low-mass young stellar objects, associated with IRAS 22343+7501 in the
molecular cloud Lynds 1251. The IRAS, ISO, Spitzer, Akari, Herschel, and WISE missions observed
different stages of its outburst. Supplemented these data with archival and our own near-infrared
observations, and considering the contributions of neighbouring sources to the mid-infrared
fluxes we studied the nature and environment of the outbursting object, and its photometric variations
from 1983 to 2017. The low-state bolometric luminosity Lbol ~ 32 Lsun is indicative of a 100000-200000
years old protostar of 1.6-1.8 solar masses. Its 2-micron brightness started rising between 1993
and 1998, reached a peak in 2009-2011, and started declining in 2015. Changes in the spectral energy
distribution suggest that the outburst was preceded by a decade-long, slow brightening in the near-infrared.
The actual accretion burst occurred between 2004 and 2007. We fitted the spectral energy distribution
in the bright phases with simple accretion disc models. The modelling suggested an increase of the
disc accretion rate from some 3.5\times 10^{-7} Msun yr^{-1} to 1.1 \times 10^{-4} Msun yr^{-1}.
The central star accreted nearly 10^{-3} solar masses, about a Jupiter mass during the ten years
of the outburst. We observed H_2 emission lines in the K-band spectrum during the fading phase in
2017. The associated optical nebulosity RNO 144 and the Herbig-Haro object HH 149 have not exhibited
significant variation in shape and brightness during the outburst.
