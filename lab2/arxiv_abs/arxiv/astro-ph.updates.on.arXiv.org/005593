The NASA Kepler space telescope has detected solar-like oscillations in several hundreds of single
stars, thereby providing a way to determine precise stellar parameters using asteroseismology.
In this work, we aim to derive the fundamental parameters of a close triple star system, HD 188753,
for which asteroseismic and astrometric observations allow independent measurements of stellar
masses. We used six months of Kepler photometry available for HD 188753 to detect the oscillation
envelopes of the two brightest stars. For each star, we extracted the individual mode frequencies
by fitting the power spectrum using a maximum likelihood estimation approach. We then derived initial
guesses of the stellar masses and ages based on two seismic parameters and on a characteristic frequency
ratio, and modelled the two components independently with the stellar evolution code CESTAM. In
addition, we derived the masses of the three stars by applying a Bayesian analysis to the position
and radial-velocity measurements of the system. Based on stellar modelling, the mean common age
of the system is $10.8 \pm 0.2\,$Gyr and the masses of the two seismic components are $M_A =$ $0.99
\pm 0.01\,M_\odot$ and $M_{Ba} =$ $0.86 \pm 0.01\,M_\odot$. From the mass ratio of the close pair,
$M_{Bb}/M_{Ba} = 0.767 \pm 0.006$, the mass of the faintest star is $M_{Bb} =$ $0.66 \pm 0.01\,M_\odot$
and the total seismic mass of the system is then $M_{syst} =$ $2.51 \pm 0.02\,M_\odot$. This value
agrees perfectly with the total mass derived from our orbital analysis, $M_{syst} =$ $2.51^{+0.20}_{-0.18}\,M_\odot$,
and leads to the best current estimate of the parallax for the system, $\pi = 21.9 \pm 0.2\,$mas. In
addition, the minimal relative inclination between the inner and outer orbits is $10.9^\circ \pm
1.5^\circ$, implying that the system does not have a coplanar configuration.
