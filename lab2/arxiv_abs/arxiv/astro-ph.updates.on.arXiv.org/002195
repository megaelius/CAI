On 2007 December 16-17, spectra were acquired of the disk of Uranus by the Spitzer Infrared Spectrometer
(IRS) when its equator was close to the sub-earth point. This spectrum provides the highest-resolution
broad-band spectrum ever obtained for Uranus from space, allowing a determination of the disk-averaged
temperature and molecule composition to a greater degree of accuracy than ever before. The temperature
profiles derived from the Voyager radio occultation experiments that match these data best are
those that assume a high abundance of methane in the deep atmosphere, but none of these models provides
a satisfactory fit over the full spectral range. This be the result of spatial differences between
global and low-latitudinal regions, changes in time, missing continuum opacity sources such as
stratospheric hazes or unknown tropospheric constituents, or undiagnosed systematic problems
with either the radio-occultation or the Spitzer IRS data sets. The spectrum is compatible with
the stratospheric temperatures derived from the Voyager ultraviolet occultations measurements.
Thermospheric temperatures determined from the analysis of the observed H2 quadrupole emission
features are colder than those derived by Herbert et al. at pressures less than ~1 microbar. Extrapolation
of the nominal model spectrum to far-infrared through millimeter wavelengths shows that the spectrum
arising solely from H2 collision-induced absorption is too warm to reproduce observations between
wavelengths of 0.8 and 3.3 mm. Adding an additional absorber such as H2S provides a reasonable match
to the spectrum, although a unique identification of the responsible absorber is not yet possible
with available data. An immediate practical use for the spectrum resulting from this model is to
establish a high-precision continuum flux model for use as an absolute radiometric standard for
future astronomical observations.
