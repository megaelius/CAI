The low-metallicity, kinematically interesting dwarf stars studied by Stephens \& Boesgaard
(2002, SB02) are re-examined using Gaia DR2 astrometry, and updated model atmospheres and atomic
line data. New stellar parameters are determined based on the Gaia DR2 parallactic distances and
Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database isochrones. These are in excellent agreement with spectroscopically
determined stellar parameters for stars with [Fe/H]$>-2$; however, large disagreements are found
for stars with [Fe/H]$\le-2$, with offsets as large as $\Delta$T$_{\rm eff}\sim+500$ K and $\Delta$log\,$g\sim+1.0$.
A subset of six stars (test cases) are analysed ab initio using high resolution spectra with Keck
HIRES and Gemini GRACES. This sub-sample is found to include two $\alpha$-challenged dwarf stars,
suggestive of origins in a low mass, accreted dwarf galaxy. The orbital parameters for the entire
SB02 sample are re-determined using \textit{Gaia} DR2 data. We find 11 stars that are dynamically
coincident with the \textit{Gaia}-Sausage accretion event and another 17 with the \textit{Gaia}-Sequoia
event in action space. Both associations include low-mass, metal-poor stars with isochrone ages
older than 10 Gyr. Two dynamical subsets are identified within \textit{Gaia}-Sequoia. When these
subsets are examined separately, a common knee in [$\alpha$/Fe] is found for the \textit{Gaia}-Sausage
and high energy \textit{Gaia}-Sequoia stars. A lower metallicity knee is tentatively identified
in the \textit{Gaia}-Sequoia low energy stars. If the metal-poor dwarf stars in these samples are
true members of the \textit{Gaia}-Sausage and \textit{Gaia}-Sequoia events, then they present
a unique opportunity to probe the earlier, more pristine, star formation histories of these systems.
