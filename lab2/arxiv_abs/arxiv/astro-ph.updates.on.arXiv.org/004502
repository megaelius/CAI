We have analysed a new high-resolution e-MERLIN 1.5 GHz radio continuum map together with $HST$
and SDSS imaging of NGC 5322, an elliptical galaxy hosting radio jets, aiming to understand the galaxy's
central structure and its connection to the nuclear activity. We decomposed the composite $HST$
+ SDSS surface brightness profile of the galaxy into an inner stellar disc, a spheroid, and an outer
stellar halo. Past works showed that this embedded disc counter-rotates rapidly with respect to
the spheroid. The $HST$ images reveal an edge-on nuclear dust disc across the centre, aligned along
the major-axis of the galaxy and nearly perpendicular to the radio jets. After careful masking of
this dust disc, we find a central stellar mass deficit $M_{\rm def}$ in the spheroid, scoured by SMBH
binaries with final mass $M_{\rm BH}$ such that $M_{\rm def}/M_{\rm BH} \sim 1.3 - 3.4$. We propose
a three-phase formation scenario for NGC 5322 where a few ($2-7$) "dry" major mergers involving
SMBHs built the spheroid with a depleted core. The cannibalism of a gas-rich satellite subsequently
creates the faint counter-rotating disc and funnels gaseous material directly onto the AGN, powering
the radio core with a brightness temperature of $T_{\rm B,core} \sim 4.5 \times 10^{7}$ K and the
low-power radio jets ($P_{\rm jets}\sim 7.04 \times 10^{20}$ W Hz$^{-1}$) which extend $\sim 1.6$
kpc. The outer halo can later grow via minor mergers and the accretion of tidal debris. The low-luminosity
AGN/jet-driven feedback may have quenched the late-time nuclear star formation promptly, which
could otherwise have replenished the depleted core.
