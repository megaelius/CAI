We present a simple physical model for the minimum mass of bound stellar clusters as a function of
the galactic environment. The model evaluates which parts of a hierarchically-clustered star-forming
region remain bound given the time-scales for gravitational collapse, star formation, and stellar
feedback. We predict the initial cluster mass functions (ICMFs) for a variety of galaxies and we
show that these predictions are consistent with observations of the solar neighbourhood and nearby
galaxies, including the Large Magellanic Cloud and M31. In these galaxies, the low minimum cluster
mass of $\sim10^2~\rm{M}_{\odot}$ is caused by sampling statistics, representing the lowest
mass at which massive (feedback-generating) stars are expected to form. At the high gas density
and shear found in the Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone and the nucleus of M82, the model predicts
that a mass $>10^2~\rm{M}_{\odot}$ must collapse into a single cluster prior to feedback-driven
dispersal, resulting in narrow ICMFs with elevated characteristic masses. We find that the minimum
cluster mass is a sensitive probe of star formation physics due to its steep dependence on the star
formation efficiency per free-fall time. Finally, we provide predictions for globular cluster
(GC) populations, finding a narrow ICMF for dwarf galaxy progenitors at high redshift, which can
explain the high specific frequency of GCs at low metallicities observed in Local Group dwarfs like
Fornax and WLM. The predicted ICMFs in high-redshift galaxies constitute a critical test of the
model, ideally-suited for the upcoming generation of telescopes.
