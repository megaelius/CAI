By measuring regular oscillations of the density of CO$_{2}$ in the upper atmosphere (between 120
and 190 km), the mass spectrometer MAVEN/NGIMS (Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN/Neutral Gas
Ion Mass Spectrometer), reveals local effects of gravity waves, and conversely, yields precious
information on the conditions for propagation and activity of gravity waves. Indeed, the intensity
of gravity waves in the upper atmosphere measured by MAVEN has been shown to be dictated by saturation
processes in isothermal conditions and is correlated to the evolution of the inverse of the background
temperature. Previous data gathered during aerobraking by the accelerometers on board MGS (Mars
Global Surveyor), ODY (Mars Odyssey) and MRO (Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter) are analyzed in the
light of those recent findings with MAVEN. The anti-correlation between GW-induced density perturbations
and background temperature is also found in MGS data, and in the ODY data acquired in the polar regions,
but not in the MRO data. MRO data in polar regions exhibit a correlation between the density perturbations
and the Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency (or, equivalently, static stability), obtained from Global
Climate Modeling compiled in the Mars Climate Database. At lower altitude levels (between 100 and
120 km), although wave saturation is still dominant, isothermal conditions are no longer verified.
In this case, theory predicts that the variability of the gravity waves intensity is no more correlated
to background temperature, but to static stability. At lower latitudes in the ODY and MRO datasets,
the GW-induced relative density perturbations are correlated with neither inverse temperature
nor static stability; in this particular case, the observed activity of gravity waves is not only
controlled by saturation, but also by the effects of gravity-wave sources, and wind filtering through
critical levels.
