One of the primary questions when characterizing Earth-sized and super-Earth-sized exoplanets
is whether they have a substantial atmosphere like Earth and Venus or a bare-rock surface like Mercury.
Phase curves of the planets in thermal emission provide clues to this question, because a substantial
atmosphere would transport heat more efficiently than a bare-rock surface. Analyzing phase curve
photometric data around secondary eclipse has previously been used to study energy transport in
the atmospheres of hot Jupiters. Here we use phase curve, Spitzer time-series photometry to study
the thermal emission properties of the super-Earth exoplanet 55 Cancri e. We utilize a semi-analytical
framework to fit a physical model to the infrared photometric data at 4.5 micron. The model uses parameters
of planetary properties including Bond albedo, heat redistribution efficiency (i.e., ratio between
radiative timescale and advective timescale of the atmosphere), and atmospheric greenhouse factor.
The phase curve of 55 Cancri e is dominated by thermal emission with an eastward-shifted hot spot.
We determine the heat redistribution efficiency to be ~1.47, which implies that the advective timescale
is on the same order as the radiative timescale. This requirement cannot be met by the bare-rock planet
scenario because heat transport by currents of molten lava would be too slow. The phase curve thus
favors the scenario with a substantial atmosphere. Our constraints on the heat redistribution
efficiency translate to an atmospheric pressure of ~1.4 bar. The Spitzer 4.5-micron band is thus
a window into the deep atmosphere of the planet 55 Cancri e.
