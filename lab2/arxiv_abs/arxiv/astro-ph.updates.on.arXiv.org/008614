The inclination distribution of the Kuiper belt provides unique constraints on its origin and dynamical
evolution, motivating vertically resolved observations of extrasolar planetesimal belts. We
present ALMA observations of millimeter emission in the near edge-on planetesimal belt around
$\beta$ Pictoris, finding that the vertical distribution is significantly better described by
the sum of two Gaussians compared to a single Gaussian. This indicates that, as for the Kuiper belt,
the inclination distribution of $\beta$ Pic's belt is better described by the sum of dynamically
hot and cold populations rather than a single component. The hot and cold populations have RMS inclinations
of 8.9$^{+0.7}_{-0.5}$ and 1.1$^{+0.5}_{-0.5}$ degrees. We also report that an axisymmetric
belt model provides a good fit to new and archival ALMA visibilities, and confirm that the midplane
is misaligned with respect to $\beta$ Pic b's orbital plane. However, we find no significant evidence
for either the inner disk tilt observed in scattered light and CO emission or the South-West/North-East
(SW/NE) asymmetry previously reported for millimeter emission. Finally, we consider the origin
of the belt's inclination distribution. Secular perturbations from $\beta$ Pic b are unlikely
to provide sufficient dynamical heating to explain the hot population throughout the belt's radial
extent, and viscous stirring from large bodies within the belt alone cannot reproduce the two populations
observed. This argues for an alternative or additional scenario, such as planetesimals being born
with high inclinations, or the presence of a `$\beta$ Pic c' planet, potentially migrating outwards
near the belt's inner edge.
