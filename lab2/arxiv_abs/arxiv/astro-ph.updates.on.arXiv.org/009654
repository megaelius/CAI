In terms of scientific output, the best way to study solar system bodies is sending spacecraft to
make in-situ measurements or to observe at close distance. Probably, the second best means to learn
about important physical properties of solar system objects is through stellar occultations.
By combining occultation observations from several sites, size and shape can be derived with kilometric
accuracy. Also, atmospheric properties can be derived if the body has an atmosphere. Furthermore,
the technique can detect rings and even satellites (although rarely) around the main body. Except
for the very special cases of Pluto and Charon, stellar occultations by Transneptunian Objects
(TNOs) had never been observed until October 2009. This was because the ephemeris of the TNOs have
much larger uncertainties than their angular diameters (typically of the order of ~10 milliarcsecond)
and also because stellar catalogs were not accurate to the milliarcsecond level. Despite the difficulties,
at the time of this writing, 43 occultations by 22 different Trans-Neptunian Objects, and 17 occultations
by 5 Centaurs have been detected thanks to the efforts of several teams. Due to the complications
of accurately predicting and observing these events, most of the successes have been achieved through
wide international collaboration, which is a key issue to succeed in observing stellar occultations
by TNOs. Multichord occultations are typically detected at a rate of ~3 per year on average, whereas
the majority of the observed occultations are single-chord detections, which means that only one
site detects the occultation. In these cases, no tight constraints on size and shape can be derived
from those observations alone. Here we review most of the aspects involved in the complex process
to successfully observe occultations, and present some of the lessons learned.
