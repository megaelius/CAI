The distribution of metals in the intra-cluster medium encodes important information about the
enrichment history and formation of galaxy clusters. Here we explore the metal content of clusters
in IllustrisTNG - a new suite of galaxy formation simulations building on the Illustris project.
Our cluster sample contains 20 objects in TNG100 - a ~(100 Mpc)^3 volume simulation with 2x1820^3
resolution elements, and 370 objects in TNG300 - a ~(300 Mpc)^3 volume simulation with 2x2500^3
resolution elements. The z=0 metallicity profiles agree with observations, and the enrichment
history is consistent with observational data going beyond z~1, showing nearly no metallicity
evolution. The abundance profiles vary only minimally within the cluster samples, especially
in the outskirts with a relative scatter of ~15%. The average metallicity profile flattens towards
the center, where we find a logarithmic slope of -0.1 compared to -0.5 in the outskirts. Cool core
clusters have more centrally peaked metallicity profiles (~0.8 solar) compared to non-cool core
systems (~0.5 solar), similar to observational trends. Si/Fe and O/Fe radial profiles follow positive
gradients as the ratios of type Ia over core-collapse supernovae increase towards cluster centres.
The outer abundance profiles do not evolve below z~2, whereas the inner profiles flatten towards
z=0. More than ~80% of the metals in the intra-cluster medium have been accreted from the proto-cluster
environment, which has been enriched to ~0.1 solar already at z~2. We conclude that the intra-cluster
metal distribution is uniform among our cluster sample, nearly time-invariant in the outskirts
for more than 10 Gyr, and forms through a universal enrichment history.
