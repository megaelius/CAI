We present the results of the $\gamma$-ray flux distribution study on the brightest blazars which
are observed by the \emph{Fermi}-LAT. We selected 50 brightest blazars based on the maximum number
of detection reported in the LAT third AGN catalog. We performed standard unbinned maximum likelihood
analysis on the LAT data during the period between August 2008 and December 2016, in order to obtain
the average monthly flux. After quality cuts, blazars for which at least 90\% of the total flux was
survived were selected for the further study, and this includes 19 FSRQs and 19 BL Lacs. The Anderson-Darling
and $\chi^2$ tests suggest that the integrated monthly flux follow a log-normal distribution for
all sources, except for three FSRQs for which neither a normal nor a log-normal distribution was
preferred. A double log-normal flux distribution tendency were observed in these sources, though
it has to be confirmed with improved statistics. We also found that, the standard deviation of the
log-normal flux distribution increases with the mean spectral index of the blazar, and can be fitted
with a line of slope 0.24$\pm$0.04. We repeat our study on three additional brightest unclassified
blazars to identify their flux distribution properties. Based on the features of their log-normal
flux distribution, we infer these unclassified blazars may be closely associated with FSRQs. We
also highlight that considering the log-normal behavior of the flux distribution of blazars, averaging
their long term flux in linear scale can largely under estimate the nominal flux and this discrepancy
can propagate down to the estimation of source parameters through spectral modeling.
