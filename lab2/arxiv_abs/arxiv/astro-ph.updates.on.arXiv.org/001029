We report the latest Planet Hunter results, including PH2 b, a Jupiter-size (R_PL = 10.12 \pm 0.56
R_E) planet orbiting in the habitable zone of a solar-type star. PH2 b was elevated from candidate
status when a series of false positive tests yielded a 99.9% confidence level that transit events
detected around the star KIC 12735740 had a planetary origin. Planet Hunter volunteers have also
discovered 42 new planet candidates in the Kepler public archive data, of which 33 have at least three
transits recorded. Most of these transit candidates have orbital periods longer than 100 days and
20 are potentially located in the habitable zones of their host stars. Nine candidates were detected
with only two transit events and the prospective periods are longer than 400 days. The photometric
models suggest that these objects have radii that range between Neptune to Jupiter. These detections
nearly double the number of gas giant planet candidates orbiting at habitable zone distances. We
conducted spectroscopic observations for nine of the brighter targets to improve the stellar parameters
and we obtained adaptive optics imaging for four of the stars to search for blended background or
foreground stars that could confuse our photometric modeling. We present an iterative analysis
method to derive the stellar and planet properties and uncertainties by combining the available
spectroscopic parameters, stellar evolution models, and transiting light curve parameters,
weighted by the measurement errors. Planet Hunters is a citizen science project that crowd-sources
the assessment of NASA Kepler light curves. The discovery of these 43 planet candidates demonstrates
the success of citizen scientists at identifying planet candidates, even in longer period orbits
with only two or three transit events.
