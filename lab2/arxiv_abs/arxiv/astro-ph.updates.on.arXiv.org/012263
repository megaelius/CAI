Data acquired at Ceres by the visible channel of the Visible and InfraRed mapping spectrometer (VIR)
on board the NASA Dawn spacecraft are affected by the temperatures of both the visible (VIS) and the
infrared (IR) sensors, which are respectively a CCD and a HgCdTe array. The variations of the visible
channel temperatures measured during the sessions of acquisitions are correlated with variations
in the spectral slope and shape for all the mission phases. The infrared channel (IR) temperature
is more stable during the acquisitions, nonetheless it is characterized by a bi-modal distribution
whether the cryocooler (and therefore the IR channel) is used or not during the visible channel operations.
When the infrared channel temperature is high (175K, i.e. not in use and with crycooler off), an additional
negative slope and a distortion are observed in the spectra of the visible channel. We developed
an empirical correction based on a reference spectrum for the whole data set; it is designed to correct
the two issues related to the sensor temperatures that we have identified. The reference spectrum
is calculated to be representative of the global Ceres' surface. It is also made of data acquired
when the visible and infrared channel temperatures are equal to the ones measured during an observation
of the Arcturus star by VIR, which is consistent with several ground-based observations. The developed
correction allows reliable analysis and mapping to be performed by minimizing the artifacts induced
by fluctuations of the VIS temperature. Thanks to this correction, a direct comparison between
different mission phases during which VIR experienced different visible and infrared channel
temperatures is now possible.
