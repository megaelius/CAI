The Kepler survey provides a statistical census of planetary systems out to the habitable zone.
Because most planets are non-transiting, orbital architectures are best estimated using simulated
observations of ensemble populations. Here, we introduce EPOS, the Exoplanet Population Observation
Simulator, to estimate the prevalence and orbital architectures of multi-planet systems based
on the latest Kepler data release, DR25. We estimate that at least 42% of sun-like stars have nearly
coplanar planetary systems with 7 or more exoplanets. The fraction of stars with at least one planet
within 1 au could be as high as 100% depending on assumptions about the distribution of single transiting
planets. We estimate an occurrence rate of planets in the habitable zone around sun-like stars of
eta_earth=36+-14%. The innermost planets in multi-planet systems are clustered around an orbital
period of 10 days (0.1 au), reminiscent of the protoplanetary disk inner edge or could be explained
by a planet trap at that location. Only a small fraction of planetary systems have the innermost planet
at long orbital periods, with fewer than ~8% and ~3% having no planet interior to the orbit of Mercury
and Venus, respectively. These results reinforce the view that the solar system is not a typical
planetary system, but an outlier among the distribution of known exoplanetary systems. We predict
that at least half of the habitable zone exoplanets are accompanied by (non-transiting) planets
at shorter orbital periods, hence knowledge of a close-in exoplanet could be used as a way to optimize
the search for Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone with future direct imaging missions.
