We present an optical spectroscopic study of a 90% complete sample of 17 nearby ULIRGs with optical
Seyfert nuclei, with the aim of investigating the nature of the nuclear warm gas outflows. A high
proportion (94%) of our sample show disturbed emission line kinematics in the form of broad (FWHM
> 500 km s-1) and/or strongly blueshifted (\Delta V < -150 km s-1) emission line components.
This proportion is significantly higher than found in a comparison sample of non-Sy ULIRGs (19%).
We also find evidence that the [OII]5007,4959 emission lines in Sy-ULIRGs are broader and more asymmetric
that in samples of non-ULIRG Seyferts. The Sy-ULIRG sample encompasses a wide diversity of emission
line profiles. In most individual objects we are able to fit the profiles of all the emission lines
with a kinematic model derived from the strong [OIII]4959,5007 lines, using between 2 and 5 Gaussian
components. From these fits we derive diagnostic line ratios that are used to investigate the ionization
mechanisms for the different kinematic components. We show that, in general, the line ratios are
consistent with gas of super-solar abundance photoionized by a combination of AGN and starburst
activity, with an increasing contribution from the AGN with increasing FWHM of the individual kinematic
components, and the AGN contribution dominating for the broadest components. However, shock ionization
cannot be ruled out in some cases. Our derived upper limits on the mass outflows rates and kinetic
powers of the emission line outflows show that they can be as energetically significant as the neutral
and molecular outflows in ULIRGs-consistent with the requirements of the hydrodynamic simulations
that include AGN feedback. However, the uncertainties are large, and more accurate estimates of
the radii, densities and reddening of the outflows are required to put these results on a firmer footing.
