It has recently been argued from a laser engineering point of view that there are only a few magic colors
for optical SETI. These are primarily the Nd:YAG line at 1064 nm and its second harmonic 532.1 nm.
Next best choices would be the sum frequency and/or second harmonic generation of Nd:YAG and Nd:YLF
laser lines, 393.8 nm (near Fraunhofer CaK), 656.5 nm (H$\alpha$) and 589.1 nm (NaD2). In this paper,
we examine the interstellar extinction, atmospheric transparency and scintillation, as well
as noise conditions for these laser lines. For strong signals, we find that optical wavelengths
are optimal for distances $d\lesssim\,$kpc. Nd:YAG at $\lambda=1{,}064\,$nm is a similarly good
choice, within a factor of two, under most conditions and out to $d\lesssim3\,$kpc. For weaker transmitters,
where the signal-to-noise ratio with respect to the blended host star is relevant, the optimal wavelength
depends on the background source, such as the stellar type. Fraunhofer spectral lines, while providing
lower stellar background noise, are irrelevant in most use cases, as they are overpowered by other
factors. Laser-pushed spaceflight concepts, such as "Breakthrough Starshot", would produce
brighter and tighter beams than ever assumed for OSETI. Such beamers would appear as naked eye stars
out to kpc distances. If laser physics has already matured and converged on the most efficient technology,
the laser line of choice for a given scenario (e.g., Nd:YAG for strong signals) can be observed with
a narrow filter to dramatically reduce background noise, allowing for large field-of-view observations
in fast surveys.
