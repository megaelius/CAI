Recent observations revealed a bimodal radius distribution of small, short-period exoplanets
with a paucity in their occurrence, a radius `valley', around $1.5-2.0$ $R_\oplus$. In this work,
we investigate the effect of a planet's own cooling luminosity on its thermal evolution and atmospheric
mass-loss (core-powered mass-loss) and determine its observational consequences for the radius
distribution of small, close-in exoplanets. Using simple analytical descriptions and numerical
simulations, we demonstrate that planetary evolution based on the core-powered mass-loss mechanism
alone (i.e., without any photoevaporation) can produce the observed valley in the radius distribution.
Our results match the valley's location, shape and slope in planet radius-orbital period parameter
space, and the relative magnitudes of the planet occurrence rate above and below the valley. We find
that the slope of the valley is, to first order, dictated by the atmospheric mass-loss timescale
at the Bondi radius and given by $\text{d log} R_p/ \text{d log} P \simeq 1/(3(1-\beta)) \simeq -0.11$,
where $M_c \propto R_c^{\beta}$ is the mass-radius relation of the core. $\beta \simeq 4$ yields
good agreement with observations, attesting to the significance of internal compression for planetary
cores more massive than Earth. We further find that the location of the valley scales with the uncompressed
core density as $\rho_{c*}^{-4/9}$ and that the observed planet population must have predominantly
rocky cores with typical water-ice fractions of less than $\sim 20\%$. Furthermore, we show that
the relative magnitude of the planet occurrence rate above and below the valley is sensitive to the
details of the planet-mass distribution but that the location of the valley is not.
