The early acceleration of protons and electrons in the nonrelativistic collisionless shocks with
three obliquities are investigated through 1D particle-in-cell simulations. In the simulations,
the charged particles possessing a velocity of $0.2\, c$ flow towards a reflecting boundary, and
the shocks with a sonic Mach number of $13.4$ and a Alf\'{v}en Mach number of $16.5$ in the downstream
shock frame are generated. In these quasi-parallel shocks with the obliquity angles $\theta = 15^\circ$,
$30^\circ$, and $45^\circ$, some of the protons and the electrons can be injected into the acceleration
processes, and their downstream spectra in the momentum space show a power law tail at a time of $1.89\times10^5
\omega_{\rm pe}^{-1}$, where $\omega_{\rm pe}$ is the electron plasma frequency. Moreover, the
charged particles reflected at the shock excite magnetic waves upstream of the shock. The shock
drift acceleration is more prominent with a larger obliquity angle for the shocks, but the accelerated
particles diffuse parallel to the shock propagation direction more easily to participate in the
diffusive shock acceleration. At the time still in the early acceleration stage, more energetic
protons and electrons appear in the downstream of the shock for $\theta = 15^\circ$ compared with
the other two obliquities; moreover, in the upstream region, the spectrum of the accelerated electrons
is the hardest for $\theta_{\rm nB} = 45^\circ$ among the three obliquities, whereas the proton
spectra for $\theta_{\rm nB} = 15^\circ$ and $45^\circ$ are similar as a result of the competition
of the effectiveness of the shock drift acceleration and the diffusive shock acceleration.
