We investigate the transformation of initial conditions for primordial curvature perturbations
under two types of transformations of the associated action: simultaneous redefinition of time
and the field to be quantised, and the addition of surface terms. The latter encompasses all canonical
transformations, whilst the time- and field-redefinition is a distinct, non-canonical transformation
since the initial and destination systems use different times. Actions related to each other via
such transformations yield identical equations of motion and preserve the commutator structure.
They further preserve the time-evolution of expectation values of quantum operators unless the
vacuum state also changes under the transformation. These properties suggest that it is of interest
to investigate vacuum prescriptions that also remain unchanged under canonical transformations.
We find that initial conditions derived via minimising the vacuum expectation value of the Hamiltonian
and those obtained using the Danielsson vacuum prescription are not invariant under these transformations,
whereas those obtained by minimising the local energy density are. We derive the range of physically
distinct initial conditions obtainable by Hamiltonian diagonalisation, and illustrate their
effect on the scalar primordial power spectrum and the Cosmic Microwave Background under the just
enough inflation model. We also generalise the analogy between the dynamics of a quantum scalar
field on a curved, time-dependent spacetime and the gauge-invariant curvature perturbation.
We argue that the invariance of the vacuum prescription obtained by minimising the renormalised
stress--energy tensor should make it the preferred procedure for setting initial conditions for
primordial perturbations. All other procedures reviewed in this work yield ambiguous initial
conditions, which is problematic both in theory and practice.
