Extra dimensions, which led to the foundation and inception of string theory, provide an elegant
approach to force-unification. With bulk curvature as high as the Planck scale, higher curvature
terms, namely f(R) gravity seems to be a natural addendum in the bulk action. These can not only pass
the classic tests of general relativity but also serve as potential alternatives to dark matter
and dark energy. With interesting implications in inflationary cosmology, gravitational waves
and particle phenomenology it is worth exploring the impact of extra dimensions and higher curvature
in black hole accretion. Various classes of black hole solutions have been derived which bear non-trivial
imprints of these ultraviolet corrections to general relativity. This in turn gets engraved in
the continuum spectrum emitted by the accretion disk around black holes. Since the near horizon
regime of supermassive black holes manifest maximum curvature effects, we compare the theoretical
estimates of disk luminosity with quasar optical data to discern the effect of the modified background
on the spectrum. In particular, we explore a certain class of black hole solution bearing a striking
resemblance with the well-known Reissner Nordstrom de Sitter/anti-de Sitter/flat spacetime
which unlike general relativity can also accommodate a negative charge parameter. By computing
error estimators like chi-square, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, index of agreement, etc. we infer
that optical observations of quasars favor a negative charge parameter which can be a possible indicator
of extra dimensions. The analysis also supports an aymptotically de Sitter spacetime with an estimate
of the magnitude of the cosmological constant whose origin is solely attributed to higher curvature
terms in higher dimensions.
