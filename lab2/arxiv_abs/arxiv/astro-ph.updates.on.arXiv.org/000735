The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the two-point correlation function of galaxies
supplies a standard ruler to probe the expansion history of the Universe. We study here several galaxy
selection schemes, aiming at building an emission-line galaxy (ELG) sample in the redshift range
$0.6<z<1.7$, that would be suitable for future BAO studies, providing a highly biased galaxy
sample. We analyse the angular galaxy clustering of galaxy selections at the redshifts 0.5, 0.7,
0.8, 1 and 1.2 and we combine this analysis with a halo occupation distribution (HOD) model to derive
the properties of the haloes these galaxies inhabit, in particular the galaxy bias on large scales.
We also perform a weak lensing analysis (aperture statistics) to extract the galaxy bias and the
cross-correlation coefficient and compare to the HOD prediction. We apply this analysis on a data
set composed of the photometry of the deep co-addition on Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe
82 (225 deg$^2$), of Canda-France-Hawai Telescope/Stripe 82 deep \emph{i}-band weak lensing
survey and of the {\it Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer}infrared photometric band W1. The analysis
on the SDSS-III/constant mass galaxies selection at $z=0.5$ is in agreement with previous studies
on the tracer, moreover we measure its cross-correlation coefficient $r=1.16\pm0.35$. For the
higher redshift bins, we confirm the trends that the brightest galaxy populations selected are
strongly biased ($b>1.5$), but we are limited by current data sets depth to derive precise values
of the galaxy bias. A survey using such tracers of the mass field will guarantee a high significance
detection of the BAO.
