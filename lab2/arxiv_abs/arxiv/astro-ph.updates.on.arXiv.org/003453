We have performed combined photoionization and photodissociation region (PDR) modelling of a
Crab Nebula filament subjected to the synchrotron radiation from the central pulsar wind nebula,
and to a high flux of charged particles; a greatly enhanced cosmic ray ionization rate over the standard
interstellar value, $\zeta_0$, is required to account for the lack of detected [C I] emission in
published Herschel SPIRE FTS observations of the Crab Nebula. The observed line surface brightness
ratios of the OH$^+$ and ArH$^+$ transitions seen in the SPIRE FTS frequency range can only be explained
with both a high cosmic ray ionization rate and a reduced ArH$^+$ dissociative recombination rate
compared to that used by previous authors, although consistent with experimental upper limits.
We find that the ArH$^+$/OH$^+$ line strengths and the observed H$_2$ vibration-rotation emission
can be reproduced by model filaments with $n_{\rm{H}} = 2 \times 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$, $\zeta = 10^7 \zeta_0$
and visual extinctions within the range found for dusty globules in the Crab Nebula, although far-infrared
emission from [O I] and [C II] is higher than the observational constraints. Models with $n_{\rm{H}}
= 1900$ cm$^{-3}$ underpredict the H$_2$ surface brightness, but agree with the ArH$^+$ and OH$^+$
surface brightnesses and predict [O I] and [C II] line ratios consistent with observations. These
models predict HeH$^+$ rotational emission above detection thresholds, but consideration of
the formation timescale suggests that the abundance of this molecule in the Crab Nebula should be
lower than the equilibrium values obtained in our analysis.
