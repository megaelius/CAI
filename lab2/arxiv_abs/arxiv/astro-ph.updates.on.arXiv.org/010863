We measured [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] using spectral synthesis of low-resolution stellar spectroscopy
for 70 individual red giant branch stars across four fields spanning the outer disk, Giant Stellar
Stream (GSS), and inner halo of M31. Fields at M31-centric projected distances of 23 kpc in the halo,
12 kpc in the halo, 22 kpc in the GSS, and 26 kpc in the outer disk are $\alpha$-enhanced, with $\langle$[$\alpha$/Fe]$\rangle$
= 0.43, 0.50, 0.41, and 0.58, respectively. The 23 kpc and 12 kpc halo fields are relatively metal-poor,
with $\langle$[Fe/H]$\rangle$ = $-$1.54 and $-$1.30, whereas the 22 kpc GSS and 26 kpc outer disk
fields are relatively metal-rich with $\langle$[Fe/H]$\rangle$ = $-$0.84 and $-$0.92, respectively.
For fields with substructure, we separated the stellar populations into kinematically hot stellar
halo components and kinematically cold components. We did not find any evidence of an [$\alpha$/Fe]
gradient along the high surface brightness core of the GSS between $\sim$17$-$22 kpc. However,
we found tentative suggestions of a negative [$\alpha$/Fe] gradient in the stellar halo, which
may indicate that different progenitor(s) or formation mechanisms contributed to the build up
of the inner versus outer halo. Additionally, the [$\alpha$/Fe] distribution of the metal-rich
([Fe/H] $>$ $-$1.5), smooth inner stellar halo (r$_{\rm{proj}}$ $\lesssim$ 26 kpc) is inconsistent
with having formed from the disruption of progenitor(s) similar to present-day M31 satellite galaxies.
The 26 kpc outer disk is most likely associated with the extended disk of M31, where its high $\alpha$-enhancement
provides support for an episode of rapid star formation in M31's disk, possibly induced by a major
merger.
