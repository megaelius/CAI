Using varying models for the star formation rate of Population (Pop) III and II stars at z>6 we
derive the expected redshift history of the global 21 cm signal from the inter-galactic medium (IGM).
To recover the observed Thomson scattering optical depth of the microwave background requires
star formation rates (SFRs) at the level of ~ 10^{-3} Msun yr^{-1} Mpc^{-3} at z ~ 15 from Pop III stars,
or ~ 10^{-1} Msun yr^{-1} Mpc^{-3} at z ~ 7 from Pop II stars which is higher than that indicated by recent
observations of galaxies. In the case the SFR is dominated by Pop III stars, the IGM quickly heats
above the CMB at z >~ 12 due to heating from supernovae. In addition, Lya photons from haloes hosting
Pop III stars couple the spin temperature to that of the gas, resulting in a deep absorption signal
in the early universe. If the star formation rate is dominated by Pop II stars, the IGM slowly heats
and exceeds the CMB temperature at z ~ 10. At z <~ 10, all the tested models are degenerate and show
positive 21 cm signals and similar mean differential brightness temperatures due to the dominance
of Pop II stars. However, the larger and varying fraction of Pop III stars at z >~ 10 is able to break
this degeneracy. We find that the impact of the initial mass function (IMF) of Pop III stars on the
21 cm signal results in an earlier change to a positive signal if the IMF slope is ~ -1.2, but is not very
sensitive to it. Measuring the 21 cm signal at z >~ 10 with next generation radio telescopes such
as the Square Kilometre Array will be able to investigate the contribution from Pop III and Pop II
stars to the global star formation rate.
