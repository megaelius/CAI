The recent local measurement of the Hubble constant based on the distance-ladder method has reached
a $1.91\%$ precision, but this result is in tension with the early-universe measurements at the
more than 4$\sigma$ level, bringing a crisis to the contemporary cosmology. In addition to the end-to-end
test of the $\Lambda$CDM model in the late universe, it is also of great interest to see how the local
$H_0$ measurement affects the determination of the primordial power spectra, and further to test
the influences for the inflation model selection. Here, we constrain the primordial power spectra
of scalar and tensor perturbations by using a series of observational data, including the Planck
2015 cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization power spectra data, the Planck
2018 lensing power spectrum data, the BICEP2/Keck Array CMB B-mode data, and also the prior of optical
depth $\tau=0.054\pm0.007$, as well as the late-universe measurements (baryon acoustic oscillations
and type Ia supernovae). In particular, we use the latest $1.91\%$ measurement of the Hubble constant,
$H_{0}=74.03\pm1.42$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, in this cosmological test. We find that considering
the latest local $H_{0}$ measurement in the data combination will lead to a larger fit value of $n_{\rm
s}$. With the addition of the latest local measurement of $H_{0}$, it is found that the natural inflation
model is totally excluded at the $2\sigma$ level, the Starobinsky $R^{2}$ inflation model is marginally
favored at around the $2\sigma$ level, and the spontaneously broken SUSY inflation model is the
most favored model.
