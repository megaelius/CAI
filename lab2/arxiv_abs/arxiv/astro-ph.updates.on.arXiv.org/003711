Ultralight bosons can induce superradiant instabilities in spinning black holes, tapping their
rotational energy to trigger the growth of a bosonic condensate. Possible observational imprints
of these boson clouds include (i) direct detection of the nearly monochromatic (resolvable or stochastic)
gravitational waves emitted by the condensate, and (ii) statistically significant evidence for
the formation of "holes" at large spins in the spin versus mass plane (sometimes also referred to
as "Regge plane") of astrophysical black holes. In this work, we focus on the prospects of LISA and
LIGO detecting or constraining scalars with mass in the range $m_s\in [10^{-19},\,10^{-15}]$
eV and $m_s\in [10^{-14},\,10^{-11}]$ eV, respectively. Using astrophysical models of black-hole
populations calibrated to observations and black-hole perturbation theory calculations of the
gravitational emission, we find that, in optimistic scenarios, LIGO could observe a stochastic
background of gravitational radiation in the range $m_s\in [2\times 10^{-13}, 10^{-12}]$ eV,
and up to $10^4$ resolvable events in a $4$-year search if $m_s\sim 3\times 10^{-13}\,{\rm eV}$.
LISA could observe a stochastic background for boson masses in the range $m_s\in [5\times 10^{-19},
5\times 10^{-16}]$, and up to $\sim 10^3$ resolvable events in a $4$-year search if $m_s\sim 10^{-17}\,{\rm
eV}$. LISA could further measure spins for black-hole binaries with component masses in the range
$[10^3, 10^7]~M_\odot$, which is not probed by traditional spin-measurement techniques. A statistical
analysis of the spin distribution of these binaries could either rule out scalar fields in the mass
range $\sim [4 \times 10^{-18}, 10^{-14}]$ eV, or measure $m_s$ with ten percent accuracy if light
scalars in the mass range $\sim [10^{-17}, 10^{-13}]$ eV exist.
