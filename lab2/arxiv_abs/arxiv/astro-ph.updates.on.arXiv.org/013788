We have studied the small scale distribution of atomic hydrogen (HI) using 21-cm absorption spectra
against multiple-component background radio continuum sources from the 21-SPONGE survey and
the Millennium Arecibo Absorption Line Survey. We have found $>5\sigma$ optical depth variations
at a level of $\sim0.03-0.5$ between 13 out of 14 adjacent sightlines separated by a few arcseconds
to a few arcminutes, suggesting the presence of neutral structures on spatial scales from a few to
thousands of AU (which we refer to as tiny scale atomic structure, TSAS). The optical depth variations
are strongest in directions where the HI column density and the fraction of HI in the cold neutral
medium (CNM) are highest, which tend to be at low Galactic latitudes. By measuring changes in the
properties of Gaussian components fitted to the absorption spectra, we find that changes in both
the peak optical depth and the linewidth of TSAS absorption features contribute to the observed
optical depth variations, while changes in the central velocity do not appear to strongly impact
the observed variations. Both thermal and turbulent motions contribute appreciably to the linewidths,
but the turbulence does not appear strong enough to confine overpressured TSAS. In a majority of
cases, the TSAS column densities are sufficiently high that these structures can radiatively cool
fast enough to maintain thermal equilibrium with their surroundings, even if they are overpressured.
We also find that a majority of TSAS is associated with the CNM. For TSAS in the direction of the Taurus
molecular cloud and the local Leo cold cloud, we estimate densities over an order of magnitude higher
than typical CNM densities.
