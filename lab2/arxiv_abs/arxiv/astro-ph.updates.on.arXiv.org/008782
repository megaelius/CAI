Observations reveal the presence of supermassive black holes (SMBH) as early as ~700 million years
after the Big Bang. Their formation path is still subject to current debate. We explore the influence
of magnetic fields, which are strongly amplified via the turbulent small-scale dynamo, on the formation
of SMBH seeds within the direct collapse scenario. In this study, we perform for the first time cosmological
magnetohydrodynamic large eddy simulations that employ a model for unresolved, compressible
MHD turbulence. In total we perform 36 simulations for 9 haloes each with two different initial magnetic
field strengths, and with and without employing the unresolved turbulence model. We make use of
the adaptive mesh refinement approach to achieve an effective spatial resolution of less than one
proper astronomical unit. We consider a regime where cooling is regulated by atomic hydrogen and
the molecular hydrogen gets dissociated by a strong radiation field. Our main finding is that the
majority of the gas properties in the haloes at the final output are predominantly determined by
the run-away gravitational collapse. Turbulence is supersonic and super-Alfv\'enic in all cases,
and magnetic fields are amplified to an approximately dynamically relevant regime. Finally, fragmentation
during the collapse is intermittent and mass accretion rates range from 0.2-3 Msun/yr. This suggests
that the presence of strongly amplified magnetic fields and turbulence provides additional pressure
support on small scales and make the direct collapse a viable scenario for the formation of massive
objects under the required ambient conditions.
