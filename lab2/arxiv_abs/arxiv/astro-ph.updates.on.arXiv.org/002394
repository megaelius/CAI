The NASA space telescope Kepler has provided unprecedented time-series observations which have
revolutionised the field of asteroseismology, i.e. the use of stellar oscillations to probe the
interior of stars. The Kepler-data include observations of stars in open clusters, which are particularly
interesting for asteroseismology. One of the clusters observed with Kepler is NGC 6811, which is
the target of the present paper. However, apart from high-precision time-series observations,
sounding the interiors of stars in open clusters by means of asteroseismology also requires accurate
and precise atmospheric parameters as well as cluster membership indicators for the individual
stars. We use medium-resolution (R~25,000) spectroscopic observations, and three independent
analysis methods, to derive effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, projected
rotational velocities and radial velocities, for 15 stars in the field of the open cluster NGC 6811.
We discover two double-lined and three single-lined spectroscopic binaries. Eight stars are classified
as either certain or very probable cluster members, and three stars are classified as non-members.
For four stars, cluster membership could not been assessed. Five of the observed stars are G-type
giants which are located in the colour-magnitude diagram in the region of the red clump of the cluster.
Two of these stars are surely identified as red clump stars for the first time. For those five stars,
we provide chemical abundances of 31 elements. The mean radial-velocity of NGC 6811 is found to be
+6.68$\pm$0.08 km s$^{-1}$ and the mean metallicity and overall abundance pattern are shown to
be very close to solar with an exception of Ba which we find to be overabundant.
