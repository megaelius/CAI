The physical origin of the near-ultraviolet MgII emission remains an under-explored domain, contrary
to more typical emission lines detected in the spectra of star-forming galaxies. We explore the
nebular and physical properties for a sample of 381 galaxies between 0.70 < z < 2.34 drawn from the
MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Survey. The spectra of these galaxies show a wide variety of profiles of the
MgII 2796,2803 resonant doublet, from absorption to emission. We present a study on the main drivers
for the detection of MgII emission in galaxy spectra. By exploiting photoionization models we verified
that the emission-line ratios observed in galaxies with MgII in emission are consistent with nebular
emission from HII regions. From a simultaneous analysis of MUSE spectra and ancillary HST information
via spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, we find that galaxies with MgII in emission have
lower stellar masses, smaller sizes, bluer spectral slopes and lower optical depth than those with
absorption. This leads us to suggest that MgII emission is a potential tracer of physical conditions
not merely related to those of the ionized gas. We show that these differences in MgII emission/absorption
can be explained in terms of a higher dust and neutral gas content in the interstellar medium (ISM)
of galaxies showing MgII in absorption, confirming the extreme sensitivity of MgII to the presence
of the neutral ISM. We conclude with an analogy between the MgII doublet and the Ly-alpha line, due
to their resonant nature. Further investigations with current and future facilities, including
JWST, are promising as the detection of MgII emission and its potential connection with Ly-alpha
could provide new insights on the ISM content in the early Universe.
