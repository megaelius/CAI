Next generation radio interferometric telescopes are entering an era of big data with extremely
large data sets. While these telescopes can observe the sky in higher sensitivity and resolution
than before, computational challenges in image reconstruction need to be overcome to realize the
potential of forthcoming telescopes. New methods in sparse image reconstruction and convex optimization
techniques (cf. compressive sensing) have shown to produce higher fidelity reconstructions of
simulations and real observations than traditional methods. This article presents distributed
and parallel algorithms and implementations to perform sparse image reconstruction, with significant
practical considerations that are important for implementing these algorithms for Big Data. We
benchmark the algorithms presented, showing that they are considerably faster than their serial
equivalents. We then pre-sample gridding kernels to scale the distributed algorithms to larger
data sizes, showing application times for 1 Gb to 2.4 Tb data sets over 25 to 100 nodes for up to 50 billion
visibilities, and find that the run-times for the distributed algorithms range from 100 milliseconds
to 3 minutes per iteration. This work presents an important step in working towards computationally
scalable and efficient algorithms and implementations that are needed to image observations of
both extended and compact sources from next generation radio interferometers such as the SKA. The
algorithms are implemented in the latest versions of the SOPT (https://github.com/astro-informatics/sopt)
and PURIFY (https://github.com/astro-informatics/purify) software packages {(Versions 3.1.0)},
which have been released alongside of this article.
