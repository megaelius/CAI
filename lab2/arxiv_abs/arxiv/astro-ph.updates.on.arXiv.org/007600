Recent work indicates that the nearby Galactic halo is dominated by the debris from a major accretion
event. We confirm that result from an analysis of APOGEE-DR14 element abundances and $\textit{Gaia}$-DR2
kinematics of halo stars. We show that $\sim$2/3 of nearby halo stars have high orbital eccentricities
($e \gtrsim 0.8$), and abundance patterns typical of massive Milky Way dwarf galaxy satellites
today, characterised by relatively low [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [Ni/Fe]. The trend followed
by high $e$ stars in the [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane shows a change of slope at [Fe/H]$\sim-1.3$, which
is also typical of stellar populations from relatively massive dwarf galaxies. Low $e$ stars exhibit
no such change of slope within the observed [Fe/H] range and show slightly higher abundances of Mg,
Al and Ni. Unlike their low $e$ counterparts, high $e$ stars show slightly retrograde motion, make
higher vertical excursions and reach larger apocentre radii. By comparing the position in [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H]
space of high $e$ stars with those of accreted galaxies from the EAGLE suite of cosmological simulations
we constrain the mass of the accreted satellite to be in the range $10^{8.5}\lesssim M_*\lesssim
10^{9}\mathrm{M_\odot}$. We show that the median orbital eccentricities of debris are largely
unchanged since merger time, implying that this accretion event likely happened at $z\lesssim1.5$.
The exact nature of the low $e$ population is unclear, but we hypothesise that it is a combination
of $\textit{in situ}$ star formation, high $|z|$ disc stars, lower mass accretion events, and contamination
by the low $e$ tail of the high $e$ population. Finally, our results imply that the accretion history
of the Milky Way was quite unusual.
