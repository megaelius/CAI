The lack of long and reliable time series of solar spectral irradiance (SSI) measurements makes
an accurate quantification of solar contributions to recent climate change difficult. Whereas
earlier SSI observations and models provided a qualitatively consistent picture of the SSI variability,
recent measurements by the SORCE satellite suggest a significantly stronger variability in the
ultraviolet (UV) spectral range and changes in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) bands in anti-phase
with the solar cycle. A number of recent chemistry-climate model (CCM) simulations have shown that
this might have significant implications on the Earth's atmosphere. Motivated by these results,
we summarize here our current knowledge of SSI variability and its impact on Earth's climate. We
present a detailed overview of existing SSI measurements and provide thorough comparison of models
available to date. SSI changes influence the Earth's atmosphere, both directly, through changes
in shortwave (SW) heating and therefore, temperature and ozone distributions in the stratosphere,
and indirectly, through dynamical feedbacks. We investigate these direct and indirect effects
using several state-of-the art CCM simulations forced with measured and modeled SSI changes. A
unique asset of this study is the use of a common comprehensive approach for an issue that is usually
addressed separately by different communities. Omissis. Finally, we discuss the reliability
of the available data and we propose additional coordinated work, first to build composite SSI datasets
out of scattered observations and to refine current SSI models, and second, to run coordinated CCM
experiments.
