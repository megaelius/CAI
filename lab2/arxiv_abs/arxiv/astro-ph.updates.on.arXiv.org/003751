The current generation of ground-based coronagraphic instruments uses deformable mirrors to
correct for phase errors and to improve contrast levels at small angular separations. Improving
these techniques, several space and ground based instruments are currently developed using two
deformable mirrors to correct for both phase and amplitude errors. However, as wavefront control
techniques improve, more complex telescope pupil geometries will soon be a limiting factor for
these next generation coronagraphic instru- ments. The technique presented in this proceeding,
the Active Correction of Aperture Discontinuities method, is taking advantage of the fact that
most future coronagraphic instruments will include two deformable mirrors, and is proposing to
find the shapes and actuator movements to correct for the effect introduced by these complex pupil
geometries. We here present the results of the parametric analysis realized on the WFIRST pupil
for which we obtained high contrast levels with several deformable mirror setups (size, separation
between them), coronagraphs (Vortex charge 2, vortex charge 4, APLC) and spectral bandwidths.
However, because contrast levels and separation are not the only metrics to maximize the scientific
return of an instrument, we also included in this study the influence of these deformable mirror
shapes on the throughput of the instrument and sensitivity to pointing jitters. Finally, we present
results obtained on another potential space based telescope segmented aperture. The main result
of this proceeding is that we now obtain comparable performance than the coronagraphs previously
designed for WFIRST. First result from the parametric analysis strongly suggest that the 2 deformable
mirror set up (size and distance between them) has a important impact on the performance in contrast
and throughput of the final instrument.
