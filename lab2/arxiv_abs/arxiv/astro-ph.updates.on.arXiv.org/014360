The nearby ultracool dwarf TRAPPIST-1 possesses several Earth-sized terrestrial planets, three
of which have equilibrium temperatures that may support liquid surface water, making it a compelling
target for exoplanet characterization. TRAPPIST-1 is an active star with frequent flaring, with
implications for the habitability of its planets. Superflares (stellar flares whose energy exceeds
10^33 erg) can completely destroy the atmospheres of a cool star's planets, allowing ultraviolet
radiation and high-energy particles to bombard their surfaces. However, ultracool dwarfs emit
little ultraviolet flux when quiescent, raising the possibility of frequent flares being necessary
for prebiotic chemistry that requires ultraviolet light. We combine Evryscope and Kepler observations
to characterize the high-energy flare rate of TRAPPIST-1. The Evryscope is an array of 22 small telescopes
imaging the entire Southern sky in g' every two minutes. Evryscope observations, spanning 170 nights
over 2 years, complement the 80-day continuous short-cadence K2 observations by sampling TRAPPIST-1's
long-term flare activity. We update TRAPPIST-1's superflare rate, finding a cumulative rate of
4.2 (+1.9 -0.2) superflares per year. We calculate the flare rate necessary to deplete ozone in the
habitable-zone planets' atmospheres, and find that TRAPPIST-1's flare rate is insufficient to
deplete ozone if present on its planets. In addition, we calculate the flare rate needed to provide
enough ultraviolet flux to power prebiotic chemistry. We find TRAPPIST-1's flare rate is likely
insufficient to catalyze some of the Earthlike chemical pathways thought to lead to RNA synthesis,
and flux due to flares in the biologically relevant UV-B band is orders of magnitude less for any TRAPPIST-1
planet than has been experienced by Earth at any time in its history.
