We combine analytical understanding of resonant dynamics in two-planet systems with machine learning
techniques to train a model capable of robustly classifying stability in compact multi-planet
systems over long timescales of $10^9$ orbits. Our Stability of Planetary Orbital Configurations
Klassifier (SPOCK) predicts stability using physically motivated summary statistics measured
in integrations of the first $10^4$ orbits, thus achieving speed-ups of up to $10^5$ over full simulations.
This computationally opens up the stability constrained characterization of multi-planet systems.
Our model, trained on $\approx 100,000$ three-planet systems sampled at discrete resonances,
generalizes both to a sample spanning a continuous period-ratio range, as well as to a large five-planet
sample with qualitatively different configurations to our training dataset. Our approach significantly
outperforms previous methods based on systems' angular momentum deficit, chaos indicators, and
parametrized fits to numerical integrations. We use SPOCK to constrain the free eccentricities
between the inner and outer pairs of planets in the Kepler-431 system of three approximately Earth-sized
planets to both be below 0.05. Our stability analysis provides significantly stronger eccentricity
constraints than currently achievable through either radial velocity or transit duration measurements
for small planets, and within a factor of a few of systems that exhibit transit timing variations
(TTVs). Given that current exoplanet detection strategies now rarely allow for strong TTV constraints
(Hadden et al., 2019), SPOCK enables a powerful complementary method for precisely characterizing
compact multi-planet systems. We publicly release SPOCK for community use.
