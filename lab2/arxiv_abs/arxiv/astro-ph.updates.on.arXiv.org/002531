The Liverpool Telescope is one of the world's premier facilities for time domain astronomy. The
time domain landscape is set to radically change in the coming decade, with synoptic all-sky surveys
such as LSST providing huge numbers of transient detections on a nightly basis; transient detections
across the electromagnetic spectrum from other major facilities such as SVOM, SKA and CTA; and the
era of `multi-messenger astronomy', wherein astrophysical events are detected via non-electromagnetic
means, such as neutrino or gravitational wave emission. We describe here our plans for the Liverpool
Telescope 2: a new robotic telescope designed to capitalise on this new era of time domain astronomy.
LT2 will be a 4-metre class facility co-located with the Liverpool Telescope at the Observatorio
del Roque de Los Muchachos on the Canary island of La Palma. The telescope will be designed for extremely
rapid response: the aim is that the telescope will take data within 30 seconds of the receipt of a trigger
from another facility. This will make it a world-leading facility for the study of fast fading transients,
and explosive phenomena discovered at early times. The telescope will have a diverse instrument
suite which is simultaneously mounted for automatic changes, but it is envisaged that the primary
instrument will be an intermediate resolution, optical/infrared spectrograph for scientific
exploitation of transients discovered with the next generation of synoptic survey facilities.
In this paper we outline the core science drivers for the telescope, and the requirements for the
optical and mechanical design.
