Classical Cepheids (CCs) are at the heart of the empirical extragalactic distance ladder. Milky
Way CCs are the only stars of this class accessible to trigonometric parallax measurements. Until
recently, the most accurate trigonometric parallaxes of Milky Way CCs were the HST/FGS measurements
collected by Benedict et al. (2002, 2007). Unfortunately, the second Gaia data release (GDR2) has
not yet delivered reliable parallaxes for Galactic CCs, failing to replace the HST/FGS sample as
the foundation of all Galactic calibrations of the Leavitt law. We aim at calibrating independently
the Leavitt law of Milky Way CCs based on the GDR2 catalog of trigonometric parallaxes. As a proxy
for the parallaxes of a sample of 23 Galactic CCs, we adopt the GDR2 parallaxes of their spatially
resolved companions. As the latter are unsaturated, photometrically stable stars, this novel
approach allows us to bypass the GDR2 bias on the parallax of the CCs that is induced by saturation
and variability. We present new Galactic calibrations of the Leavitt law in the J, H, K, V, Wesenheit
WH and Wesenheit WVK bands based on the GDR2 parallaxes of the CC companions. We show that the adopted
value of the zero point of the GDR2 parallaxes, within a reasonable range, has a limited impact on
our Leavitt law calibration. However, we find a significant difference with respect to the calibration
based on the HST/FGS parallaxes, that corresponds to an FGS parallax zero point offset of approx.
+0.2 mas. The discrepancy that we observe between the GDR2 and HST/FGS parallaxes has important
consequences on the existing Galactic calibrations of the Leavitt law. We note that our results
translate into a Hubble constant of 68.43 +/- 2.08 km/s/Mpc and 69.30 +/- 2.08 km/s/Mpc for a GDR2
parallax offset of 0.029 mas and 0.046 mas, respectively.
