As a part of interstellar dust, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are processed by the interaction
with vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photons that are emitted by hot young stars. This interaction leads
to the emission of the well-known aromatic infrared bands but also of electrons, which can significantly
contribute to the heating of the interstellar gas.Our aim is to investigate the impact of molecular
size on the photoionization properties of cationic PAHs.Trapped PAH cations of sizes between 30
and 48 carbon atoms were submitted to VUV photons in the range of 9 to 20 eV from the DESIRS beamline
at the synchrotron SOLEIL. All resulting photoproducts including dications and fragment cations
were mass-analyzed and recorded as a function of photon energy.Photoionization is found to be predominant
over dissociation at all energies, which differs from an earlier study on smaller PAHs. The photoionization
branching ratio reaches 0.98 at 20 eV for the largest studied PAH. The photoionization threshold
is observed to be between 9.1 and 10.2 eV, in agreement with the evolution of the ionization potential
with size. Ionization cross sections were indirectly obtained and photoionization yields extracted
from their ratio with theoretical photoabsorption cross sections, which were calculated using
time-dependent density functional theory. An analytical function was derived to calculate this
yield for a given molecular size.Large PAH cations could be efficiently ionized in H I regions and
provide a contribution to the heating of the gas by photoelectric effect. Our work provides recipes
to be used in astronomical models to quantify these points.
