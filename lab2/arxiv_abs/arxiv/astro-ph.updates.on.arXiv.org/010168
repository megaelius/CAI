[Abridged] Aims. We searched for circumplanetary sodium and ionized calcium gas around the disintegrating
rocky exoplanet K2-22 b to constrain its gas-loss and sublimation processes. Methods. We observed
four transits of K2-22 b with X-shooter on ESO's Very Large Telescope to obtain time-series of intermediate-resolution
(R $\sim$ 11400) spectra. Our analysis focused on the two sodium D lines (588.995 nm and 589.592 nm)
and the Ca$^{+}$ triplet (849.802 nm, 854.209 nm and 866.214 nm). Planet-related absorption is
searched for in the velocity rest frame of the planet, which changes from $\pm$66 kms$^{-1}$ during
the transit. Results. Since K2-22 b exhibits highly variable transit depths, we analyzed the individual
nights and their average. By injecting signals we reached 5$\sigma$ upper-limits on the individual
nights that ranged from 11% - 13% and 1.7% - 2.0% for the tail's sodium and ionized calcium absorption,
respectively. Night 1 was contaminated by its companion star so we considered weighted averages
with and without Night 1 and quote conservative 5$\sigma$ limits without Night 1 of 9% and 1.4%, respectively.
Assuming their mass fractions to be similar to those in the Earth's crust, these limits correspond
to scenarios in which 0.04% and 35% of the transiting dust is sublimated and observed as absorbing
gas. However, this assumes the gas to be co-moving with the planet. We show that for the high irradiation
environment of K2-22 b, sodium and ionized calcium could be quickly accelerated to 100s of km s$^{-1}$
due to radiation pressure and entrainment by the stellar wind, making them much more difficult to
detect. No evidence for such possibly broad and blue-shifted signals are seen in our data. Conclusions.
Future observations aimed at observing circumplanetary gas should take into account the possible
broad and blue-shifted velocity field of atomic and ionized species.
