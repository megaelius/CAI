We present a new method to measure primordial non-Gaussianity, using the cross-correlation between
galaxy surveys and the CMB lensing signal to measure galaxy bias on very large scales, where local-type
primordial non-Gaussianity predicts a $k^2$ divergence. We use the CMB lensing map recently published
by the Planck collaboration, and measure its external correlations with a suite of six galaxy catalogues
spanning a broad redshift range. We then consistently combine correlation functions to extend
the recent analysis by Giannantonio et al. (2013), where the density-density and the density-CMB
temperature correlations were used. Due to the intrinsic noise of the Planck lensing map, which
affects the largest scales most severely, we find that the constraints on the galaxy bias are similar
to the constraints from density-CMB temperature correlations. Including lensing constraints
only improves the previous statistical measurement errors marginally, and we obtain $ f_{\mathrm{NL}}
= 12 \pm 21 $ (1$\sigma$) from the combined data set. However, the lensing measurements serve as an
excellent test of systematic errors: we now have three methods to measure the large-scale, scale-dependent
bias from a galaxy survey: auto-correlation, and cross-correlation with both CMB temperature
and lensing. As the publicly available Planck lensing maps have had their largest-scale modes at
multipoles $l<10$ removed, which are the most sensitive to the scale-dependent bias, we consider
mock CMB lensing data covering all multipoles. We find that, while the effect of $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$
indeed increases significantly on the largest scales, so do the contributions of both cosmic variance
and the intrinsic lensing noise, so that the improvement is small.
