Future space missions will improve considerably our understanding of the formation and history
of planetary systems. Currently, observations show that the presence of planetary companions
is closely linked to the metallicity and the chemical abundances of the host stars. We aim to build
an integrated tool to predict the planet building blocks composition as a function of the stellar
populations, for the interpretation of the ongoing and future large surveys. We synthesize stellar
populations with the Besan\c{c}on Galaxy model (BGM) which includes stellar evolutionary tracks
computed with the stellar evolution code STAREVOL. We integrate to the BGM a simple stoichiometric
model to determine the expected composition of the planet building blocks. We determine the expected
PBB composition around FGK stars, for the four galactic populations within the Milky Way. Our solar
neighborhood simulations are in good agreement with the recent results obtained with the HARPS
survey for f_iron, f_w and the heavy mass fraction f_Z. We present evidence of the clear dependence
of f_iron and f_w with the initial alpha abundances [\alpha/Fe] of the host star. We find that the
different initial [\alpha/Fe] distributions in the different galactic populations lead to a bimodal
distribution of PBB composition and to an iron/water valley separating PBB with high and low iron/water
mass fractions. We linked host star abundances and expected PBB composition in an integrated model
of the Galaxy. Derived trends are an important step for statistical analyses of expected planet
properties. In particular, internal structure models may use these results to derive statistical
trends of rocky planets properties, constrain habitability and prepare interpretation of on-going
and future large scale surveys of exoplanet search.
