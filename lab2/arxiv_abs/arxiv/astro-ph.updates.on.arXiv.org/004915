We conduct a small-scale pathfinding survey designed to identify the average polarization properties
of the diffuse ISM locally at the lowest dust content regions. We perform deep optopolarimetric
surveys within three $\sim 15' \times 15'$ regions located at $b > 48^\circ$, using the RoboPol instrument.
The observed samples of stars are photometrically complete to $\sim$16 mag in the R-band. The selected
regions exhibit low dust emission at 353 GHz and low total reddening compared to the majority of high-latitude
sightlines. We measure the level of systematic uncertainty for all observing epochs and find it
to be 0.1\% in fractional linear polarization, $p$. The majority of individual stellar measurements
are non-detections. However, our survey strategy enables us to locate the mean fractional linear
polarization $p_{mean}$ in each of the three regions. The region with lowest dust content yields
$p_{mean}=(0.054 \pm 0.038) \%$, not significantly different from zero. We find significant detections
for the remaining two regions of: $p_{mean}=(0.113 \pm 0.036) \%$ and $p_{mean}=(0.208 \pm 0.044)
\%$. Using a Bayesian approach we provide upper limits on the intrinsic spread of the small-scale
distributions of $q$ and $u$. At the detected $p_{mean}$ levels, the determination of the systematic
uncertainty is critical for the reliability of the measurements. We verify the significance of
our detections with statistical tests, accounting for all sources of uncertainty. Using publicly
available HI emission data, we identify the velocity components that most likely account for the
observed $p_{mean}$ and find their morphologies to be misaligned with the orientation of the mean
plane-of-sky magnetic field at a spatial resolution of 10$\arcmin$. We find indications that the
standard upper envelope of $p$ with reddening underestimates the maximum $p$ at very low E(B-V)
($\leq 0.01$ mag).
