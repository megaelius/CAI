We construct simple triaxial generalisations of Navarro-Frenk-White haloes. The models have
elementary gravitational potentials, together with a density that is cusped like 1/r at small radii
and falls off like 1/r^3 at large radii. The ellipticity varies with radius in a manner that can be
tailored to the user's specification. The closed periodic orbits in the planes perpendicular to
the short and long axes of the model are well-described by epicyclic theory, and can be used as building
blocks for long-lived discs. As an application, we carry out the simulations of thin discs of satellites
in triaxial dark halo potentials. This is motivated by the recent claims of an extended, thin disc
of satellites around the M31 galaxy with a vertical rms scatter of ~12 kpc and a radial extent of ~ 300
kpc (Ibata et al. 2013). We show that a thin satellite disc can persist over cosmological times if
and only if it lies in the planes perpendicular to the long or short axis of a triaxial halo, or in the
equatorial or polar planes of a spheroidal halo. In any other orientation, then the disc thickness
doubles on ~5 Gyr timescales and so must have been born with an implausibly small vertical scaleheight.
A natural consequence of a thin disc of satellites which contains the Milky Way galaxy is that the
latter's tidal forces are very effective in distorting the orbits. Discs of satellites that are
initially nearly circular become lop-sided and distended towards the Milky Way, even after a few
dynamical timescales. This provides a natural explanation of the long-standing puzzle that the
observed distribution of M31 satellites lies preponderantly on the near side with respect to the
Milky Way,
