We present new estimates of protosolar elemental abundances based on an improved combination of
solar photospheric abundances and CI chondritic abundances. These new estimates indicate CI chondrites
and solar abundances are consistent for 60 elements. We compare our new protosolar abundances with
our recent estimates of bulk Earth composition (normalized to aluminium), thereby quantifying
the devolatilization in going from the solar nebula to the formation of the Earth. The quantification
yields a linear trend $\log(f) = \alpha\log(T_C) + \beta$, where $f$ is the Earth-to-Sun abundance
ratio and $T_C$ is the 50$\%$ condensation temperature of elements. The best fit coefficients are:
$\alpha = 3.676\pm 0.142$ and $\beta = -11.556\pm 0.436$. The quantification of these parameters
constrains models of devolatilization processes. For example, the coefficients $\alpha$ and
$\beta$ determine a critical devolatilization temperature for the Earth $T_{\mathrm{D}}(\mathrm{E})
= 1391 \pm 15$ K. The terrestrial abundances of elements with $T_{C} < T_{\mathrm{D}}(\mathrm{E})$
are depleted compared with solar abundances, whereas the terrestrial abundances of elements with
$T_{C} > T_{\mathrm{D}}(\mathrm{E})$ are indistinguishable from solar abundances. The terrestrial
abundance of Hg ($T_C$ = 252 K) appears anomalously high under the assumption that solar and CI chondrite
Hg abundances are identical. To resolve this anomaly, we propose that CI chondrites have been depleted
in Hg relative to the Sun by a factor of $13\pm7$. We use the best-fit volatility trend to derive the
fractional distribution of carbon and oxygen between volatile and refractory components ($f_\mathrm{vol}$,
$f_\mathrm{ref}$). We find ($0.91\pm 0.08$, $0.09 \pm 0.08$) for carbon and ($0.80 \pm 0.04$, $0.20
\pm 0.04$) for oxygen.
