The formation of trans-Neptunian satellite systems at the stage of rarefied preplanetesimals
(i.e., condensations of dust and/or objects less than 1 m in diameter) is discussed. It is assumed
that trans-Neptunian objects (including those with satellites) could form as a result of compression
of parental rarefied preplanetesimals. The formulas for calculating the angular momentum of two
colliding condensations with respect to their center of mass, which were applied earlier in (Ipatov,
2010) in the comparison of such momenta with the angular momenta of observed satellite systems,
are used to estimate the angular momenta of condensations needed to form satellite systems. It is
demonstrated that the angular velocities of condensations used in (Nesvorny et al., 2010) as the
initial data in the computer simulation of compression of rarefied preplanetesimals and subsequent
formation of trans-Neptunian satellite systems may be obtained in collisions of preplanetesimals
with their radii comparable to the corresponding Hill radii. For example, these angular velocities
are in the range of possible values of angular velocities of a parental rarefied preplanetesimal
formed as a result of a merger of two colliding rarefied preplanetesimals that moved in circular
heliocentric orbits before a collision. Some rarefied preplanetesimals formed as a result of collision
of preplanetesimals in the region of formation of solid small bodies acquire such angular momenta
that are sufficient to form satellite systems of small bodies. It is likely that the ratio of the number
of rarefied preplanetesimals with such angular momenta to the total number of rarefied preplanetesimals
producing classical trans-Neptunian objects with diameters larger than 100 km was 0.45 (the initial
fraction of satellite systems among all classical trans-Neptunian objects).
