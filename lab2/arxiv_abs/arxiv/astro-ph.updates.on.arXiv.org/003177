Many pulsating low-mass white-dwarf stars have been detected in the last years in the field of our
Galaxy. Given that some of them exhibit multiperiodic variation of brightness, it is possible to
probe their interiors through asteroseismology. We present a detailed asteroseismological study
of all the known low-mass variable white dwarf stars based on a complete set of fully evolutionary
models representative of low-mass He-core white dwarf stars. We employed adiabatic radial and
nonradial pulsation periods for low-mass white dwarf models with stellar masses ranging from $0.1554$
to $0.4352\ M_{\odot}$, that were derived by simulating the nonconservative evolution of a binary
system consisting of an initially $1 M_{\odot}$ ZAMS star and a $1.4 M_{\odot}$ neutron star companion.
We estimated the mean period spacing for the stars under study and then we used the comparison between
the observed period spacing with the average of the computed period spacings for our grid of models
to constrain the stellar mass. We also employed the individual observed periods of every known pulsating
low-mass white dwarf star, to search for a representative seismological model. We found that even
though the stars under analysis exhibit few periods and the period fits show multiplicity of solutions,
it is possible to find seismological models whose mass and effective temperature are in agreement
with the values given by spectroscopy, for most of the cases. In the two cases where we could extract
the period spacing from the set of observed periods, this method led to values of the stellar masses
substantially larger than expected for this type of stars. The results presented in this work show
in the one hand, the need for further photometric searches, and on the other hand, some improvements
of the theoretical models, in order to place the asteroseismological results on a firmer ground.
