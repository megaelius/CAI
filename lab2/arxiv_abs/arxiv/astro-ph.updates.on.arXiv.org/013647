We determine the Milky Way (MW) mass profile inferred from fitting physically motivated models
to the Gaia DR2 Galactic rotation curve and other data. Using various hydrodynamical simulations
of MW-mass haloes, we show that the presence of baryons induces a contraction of the dark matter (DM)
distribution in the inner regions, r<20 kpc. We provide an analytic expression that relates the
baryonic distribution to the change in the DM halo profile. For our galaxy, the contraction increases
the enclosed DM halo mass by factors of roughly 1.3, 2 and 4 at radial distances of 20, 8 and 1 kpc, respectively
compared to an uncontracted halo. Ignoring this contraction results in systematic biases in the
inferred halo mass and concentration. We provide a best-fitting contracted NFW halo model to the
MW rotation curve that matches the data very well. The best-fit has a DM halo mass, $M_{200}^{\rm
DM}=0.97_{-0.19}^{+0.24}\times10^{12} M_\odot$, and concentration before baryon contraction
of $9.4_{-2.6}^{+1.9}$, which lie close to the median halo mass--concentration relation predicted
in $\Lambda$CDM. The inferred total mass, $M_{200}^{\rm total}=1.08_{-0.14}^{+0.20} \times
10^{12} M_\odot$, is in good agreement with recent measurements. The model gives a MW stellar mass
of $5.04_{-0.52}^{+0.43}\times10^{10} M_\odot$ and infers that the DM density at the Solar position
is $\rho_{\odot}^{\rm DM}=8.8_{-0.5}^{+0.5}\times10^{-3} M_\odot \rm{pc}^{-3}\equiv0.33_{-0.02}^{+0.02}~\rm{GeV}~\rm{cm}^{-3}$.
The rotation curve data can also be fitted with an uncontracted NFW halo model, but with very different
DM and stellar parameters. The observations prefer the physically motivated contracted NFW halo,
but the measurement uncertainties are too large to rule out the uncontracted NFW halo.
