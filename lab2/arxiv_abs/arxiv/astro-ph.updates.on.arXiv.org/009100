We present new measurements of the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMF) and UV luminosity
functions (UV LF) for galaxies from $z=6-9$ within the Frontier Field cluster MACSJ0416.1-2403
and its parallel field. To obtain these results, we derive the stellar masses of our sample by fitting
synthetic stellar population models to their observed spectral energy distribution with the inclusion
of nebular emission lines. This is the deepest and farthest in distance mass function measured to
date and probes down to a level of M$_{*} = 10^{6.8}M_{\odot}$. The main result of this study is that
the low-mass end of our GSMF to these limits and redshifts appears to become steeper from $-1.98_{-0.07}^{+0.07}$
at $z=6$ to $-2.38_{-0.88}^{+0.72}$ at $z=9$, steeper than previously observed mass functions
at slightly lower redshifts, and we find no evidence of turnover in the mass range probed. We furthermore
demonstrate that the UV LF for these system also appears to show a steepening at the highest redshifts,
without any evidence of turnover in the luminosity range probed. Our $M_{\mathrm{UV}}-M_{*}$
relation exhibit shallower slopes than previously observed and are in accordance with a constant
mass-to-light ratio. Integrating our GSMF, we find that the stellar mass density increases by a
factor of $\sim15_{-6}^{+21}$ from $z=9$ to $z=6$. We estimate the dust-corrected star formation
rates (SFRs) to calculate the specific star formation rates ($\mathrm{sSFR}=\mathrm{SFR/M_{*}}$)
of our sample, and find that for a fixed stellar mass of $5\times10^{9}M_{\odot}$, sSFR $\propto(1+z)^{2.01\pm0.16}$.
Finally, from our new measurements, we estimate the UV luminosity density ($\rho_{\textrm{UV}}$)
and find that our results support a smooth decline of $\rho_{\textrm{UV}}$ towards high redshifts.
