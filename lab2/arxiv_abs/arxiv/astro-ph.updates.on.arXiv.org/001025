We consider photometric reverberation mapping, where the nuclear continuum variations are monitored
via a broad band filter and the echo of emission line clouds of the broad line region (BLR) is measured
with a suitable narrow band (NB) filter. We investigate how an incomplete emission line coverage
by the NB filter influences the BLR size determination. This includes two basic cases: 1) a symmetric
cut of the blue and red part of the line wings, and 2) the filter positioned asymmetrically to the line
center so that essentially a complete half of the emission line is contained in the NB filter. We find
that symmetric cutting of line wings may lead to an overestimate of the BLR size which is less than
5%. The case of asymmetric line coverage, as for our data of the Seyfert-1 galaxy 3C120, yields the
BLR size with less than 1% bias. Our results suggest that any BLR size bias due to narrow-band line
cut in photometric reverberation mapping is small and in most cases negligible. We use well sampled
photometric reverberation mapping light curves with sharp variation features in order to determine
the geometry type of the BLR for 3C120. Modelling of the light curve argues for a nearly face-on disk-like
geometry with inclination i = 10 +/- 5 deg and extension from 22 to 28 light days. The inferred geometry
allows us to precisely determine the geometry scaling factor of 3C120 (f=46) which is about eight
times higher than the statistically derived f=5.5 widely used in black hole mass calculations.
Using previously determined virial mass M_BH = 10 +/- 5 * 10^6 solar masses, we obtain a black hole
mass M_BH = 460 * 10^6 solar masses. If the BLR is disk-like in general, then the uncertainty on the
individual black hole mass determinations can be remarkably improved. Finally, we discuss deviations
of Seyfert-1 galaxies from the M_BH - sigma relation. (Abstract shortened, see the manuscript.)
