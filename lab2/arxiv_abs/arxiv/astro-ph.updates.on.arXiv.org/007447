Observations of stellar magnetism indicate that stars of types F, G and K have magnetic activity
similar to that observed in the Sun. Two fundamental properties of stellar magnetic fields have
been determined for a significant number of stars with different Rossby numbers (Ro), namely the
magnetic field strength and the magnetic cycle period. The field strength exhibits two regimes:
1) for fast rotation the field strength is independent of Ro, 2) for slow rotation the field decays
with Ro with power law dependence. For the magnetic cycle period two regimes of activity, the so called
active and inactive branches, have been identified. For both of them, the longer the rotation period,
the longer the activity cycle. In this paper we present results of global dynamo simulations which
show that the rotational shear in both, the tachocline and the near-surface layer, plays a fundamental
role in explaining these observational properties. The results are consistent with non-linear
alpha-Omega dynamos with different modes and levels of complexity. The magnetic field strength
can be explained from results of a mean-field analysis. The power-law decay of the field strength
in slow rotating stars is attributed to the decrease of the near-surface radial shear with Ro and
to the meridional motions that advect the poloidal magnetic field out of the surface layers. In agreement
with the observations, the magnetic cycle period increases with the rotational period. All the
periods are consistent with the active branch of activity. However, a bifurcation is observed for
Ro ~1. It separates a regime where the oscillatory dynamo operates in the convection zone, from a
regime where the tachocline has a predominant role. In the latter, the periods are believed to result
from the periodic energy exchange between the dynamo and the magneto-shear instabilities developing
in the tachocline region.
