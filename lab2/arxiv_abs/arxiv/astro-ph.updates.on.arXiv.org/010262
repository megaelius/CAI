A significant tension has become manifest between the current expansion rate of our Universe measured
from the cosmic microwave background by the Planck satellite and from local distance probes, which
has prompted for interpretations of that as evidence of new physics. Within conventional cosmology
a likely source of this discrepancy is identified here as a matter density fluctuation around the
cosmic average of the 40 Mpc environment in which the calibration of Supernovae Type Ia separations
with Cepheids and nearby absolute distance anchors is performed. Inhomogeneities on this scale
easily reach 40% and more. In that context, the discrepant expansion rates serve as evidence of residing
in an underdense region of $\delta_{\rm env}\approx-0.5\pm0.1$. The probability for finding
this local expansion rate given the Planck data lies at the 95% confidence level. Likewise, a hypothetical
equivalent local data set with mean expansion rate equal to that of Planck would not gain strong preference
over the actual data in the respective Bayes factor. These results therefore suggest consistency
between the local and Planck measurements of the Hubble constant. Generally accounting for the
environmental uncertainty, the local measurement may be reinterpreted as a constraint on the cosmological
Hubble constant of $H_0=(76.5\pm5.5)$ km/s/Mpc for the mean and standard deviation or $H_0=74.7^{+5.8}_{-4.2}$
km/s/Mpc in terms of median and 68% confidence bounds. The current simplified analysis may be augmented
with the employment of the full available data sets, an impact study for the immediate $\lesssim10$
Mpc environment of the distance anchors, more prone to inhomogeneities, as well as expansion rates
measured by gravitational waves, currently limited to the same 40 Mpc region, and local galaxy motions.
