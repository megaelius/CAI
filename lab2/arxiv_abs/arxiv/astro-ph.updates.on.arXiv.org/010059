The formation of globular clusters remains an open debate. Dwarf starburst galaxies are efficient
at forming young massive clusters with similar masses as globular clusters and may hold the key to
understanding their formation. We study star cluster formation in a tidal debris - including the
vicinity of three tidal dwarf galaxies - in a massive gas dominated collisional ring around NGC~5291.
These dwarfs have physical parameters which differ significantly from local starbursting dwarfs.
They are gas-rich, highly turbulent, have a gas metallicity already enriched up to half-solar,
and are expected to be free of dark matter. The aim is to study massive star cluster formation in this
as yet unexplored type of environment. We use imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope using broadband
filters covering the wavelength range from the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared. We determine
the masses and ages of the cluster candidates by using the spectral energy distribution-fitting
code CIGALE, carefully considering age-extinction degeneracy effects on the estimation of the
physical parameters. We find that the tidal dwarf galaxies in the ring of NGC 5291 are forming star
clusters with an average efficiency of $\sim40\%$, comparable to blue compact dwarf galaxies.
We also find massive star clusters for which the photometry suggests that they were formed at the
very birth of the tidal dwarf galaxies and have survived for several hundred million years. Therefore
our study shows that extended tidal dwarf galaxies and compact clusters may be formed simultaneously.
In the specific case observed here, the young star clusters are not massive enough to survive for
a Hubble time. However one may speculate that similar objects at higher redshift, with higher star
formation rate, might form some of the long lived globular clusters.
