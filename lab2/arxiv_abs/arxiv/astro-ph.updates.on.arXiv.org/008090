The high energy radiation environment around M dwarf stars strongly impacts the characteristics
of close-in exoplanet atmospheres, but these wavelengths are difficult to observe due to geocoronal
and interstellar contamination. On account of these observational restrictions, a stellar atmosphere
model may be used to compute the stellar extreme ultraviolet (EUV; 100 - 912 \AA) spectrum. We present
a case study of the ultra-cool M8 dwarf star, TRAPPIST-1, which hosts seven transiting short-period
terrestrial sized planets whose atmospheres will be probed by the James Webb Space Telescope. We
construct semi-empirical non-LTE model spectra of TRAPPIST-1 that span EUV to infrared wavelengths
(100 \AA\ - 2.5 $\mu$m) using the atmosphere code PHOENIX. These upper-atmosphere models contain
prescriptions for the chromosphere and transition region and include newly added partial frequency
redistribution capabilities. In the absence of broadband UV spectral observations, we constrain
our models using HST Ly$\alpha$ observations from TRAPPIST-1 and GALEX FUV and NUV photometric
detections from a set of old M8 stars ($>$1 Gyr). We find that calibrating the models using both data
sets separately yield similar FUV and NUV fluxes, and EUV fluxes that range from (1.32 - 17.4) $\times$
10$^{-14}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. The results from these models demonstrate that the EUV emission
is very sensitive to the temperature structure in the transition region. Our lower activity models
predict EUV fluxes similar to previously published estimates derived from semi-empirical scaling
relationships, while the highest activity model predicts EUV fluxes a factor of ten higher. Results
from this study support the idea that the TRAPPIST-1 habitable zone planets likely do not have much
liquid water on their surfaces due to the elevated levels of high energy radiation emitted by the
host star.
