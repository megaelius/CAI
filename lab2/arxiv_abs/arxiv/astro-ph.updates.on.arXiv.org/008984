We report on NuSTAR observations of transient pulsations in the neutron star X-ray binary SMC X-1.
The transition from non-pulsing to pulsing states was not accompanied by a large change in flux.
Instead, both pulsing and non-pulsing states were observed in a single observation during the low-flux
super-orbital state. During the high-state, we measure a pulse period of $P = 0.70117(9)\,\mathrm{s}$
at $T_{ref} = 56145\,\mathrm{MJD}$. Spectral analysis during non-pulsing and pulsing states
reveals that the observations can be consistently modeled by an absorbed power law with a phenomenological
cutoff resembling a Fermi-Dirac distribution, or by a partially obscured cutoff power law. The
shapes of the underlying continua show little variability between epochs, while the covering fraction
and column density vary between super-orbital states. The strength of pulsations also varies,
leading us to infer that the absence and reemergence of pulsations are related to changing obscuration,
such as by a warped accretion disk. SMC X-1 is accreting near or above its Eddington limit, reaching
an unabsorbed X-ray luminosity of $L_{\rm X}({\rm 2-10~keV}) \approx 5 \times 10^{38}\, {\rm erg}\,
{\rm s}^{-1}$. This suggests that SMC X-1 may be a useful local analog to ultraluminous X-ray pulsars
(ULXPs), which likewise exhibit strong variability in their pulsed fractions, as well as flux variability
on similar timescales. In particular, the gradual pulse turn-on which has been observed in M82 X-2
is similar to the behavior we observe in SMC X-1. Thus we propose that pulse fraction variability
of ULXPs may also be due to variable obscuration.
