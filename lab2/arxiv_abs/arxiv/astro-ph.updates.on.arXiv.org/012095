Blue Stragglers are stars located in an unexpected region of the color-magnitude diagram of a stellar
population, as they appear bluer and more luminous than the stars in the turnoff region. They are
ubiquitous, since they have been found among Milky Way field stars, in open and globular clusters,
and also in other galaxies of the Local Group. Here we present a study on the blue straggler population
of the old and metal-rich open cluster Collinder 261, based on Gaia DR2 data and on a multi-epoch radial
velocity survey conducted with FLAMES@VLT. We also analyze the radial distribution of the blue
straggler population to probe the dynamical status of the cluster. Blue straggler candidates were
identified first with Gaia DR2, according to their position on the CMD, proper motions, and parallaxes.
Their radial distribution was compared with those of the main sequence, red giant, and red clump
stars, to evaluate mass segregation. Additionally, their radial velocities (and the associated
uncertainties) were compared with the mean radial velocity and the velocity dispersion of the cluster.
When possible, close binaries and long-period binaries were also identified, based on the radial
velocity variations for the different epochs. We also looked for yellow stragglers, i.e., possible
evolved blue stragglers. We found 53 blue stragglers members of Collinder 261, six of them already
identified in previous catalogs. Among the blue straggler candidates with radial velocity measurements,
we found one long-period binary, five close-binary systems, three non-variable stars; we also
identified one yellow straggler.
