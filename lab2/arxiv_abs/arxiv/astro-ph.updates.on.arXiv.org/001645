We study the possibility that primordial magnetic fields generated in the transition between inflation
and reheating posses magnetic helicity, $H_M$. The fields are induced by stochastic currents of
scalar charged particles created during the mentioned transition. We estimate the rms value of
the induced magnetic helicity by computing different four-point SQED Feynman diagrams. For any
considered volume, the magnetic flux across its boundaries is in principle non null, which means
that the magnetic helicity in those regions is gauge dependent. We use the prescription given by
Berger and Field and interpret our result as the difference between two magnetic configurations
that coincide in the exterior volume. In this case the magnetic helicity gives only the number of
magnetic links inside the considered volume. We calculate a concrete value of $H_M$ for large scales
and analyze the distribution of magnetic defects as a function of the scale. Those defects correspond
to regular as well as random fields in the considered volume. We find that the fractal dimension of
the distribution of topological defects is $D = 1/2$. We also study if the regular fields induced
on large scales are helical, finding that they are and that the associated number of magnetic defects
is independent of the scale. In this case the fractal dimension is $D=0$. We finally estimate the
intensity of fields induced at the horizon scale of reheating, and evolve them until the decoupling
of matter and radiation under the hypothesis of inverse cascade of magnetic helicity. The resulting
intensity is high enough and the coherence length long enough to have an impact on the subsequent
process of structure formation.
