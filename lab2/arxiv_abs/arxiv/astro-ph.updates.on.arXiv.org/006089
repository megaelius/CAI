Sudden jets of collimated plasma arise from many locations on the Sun, including active regions.
The magnetic field along which a jet emerges is often open to interplanetary space, offering a clear
"escape route" for any flare-accelerated electrons and making jets lucrative targets for studying
particle acceleration and the solar sources of transient heliospheric events. Bremsstrahlung
hard X-rays (HXRs) could, in principle, trace the accelerated electrons that escape along the paths
of the jets, but measurements of the escaping electron beams are customarily difficult due to the
low densities of the corona. In this work, we augment HXR observations with gyrosynchrotron emission
observed in microwaves, as well as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission and modeling to investigate
flare-accelerated electrons in a coronal jet. HXR and microwave data from RHESSI and OVSA, respectively,
give complementary insight into electron spectra and locations, including the presence of accelerated
electrons in the jet itself. High-time-resolution HXR data from the Konus-Wind instrument suggest
electron acceleration timescales on the order of 1 second or shorter. We model the energetic electron
distributions in the GX Simulator framework using SoHO/MDI, RHESSI, TRACE, and OVSA data as constraints.
The result is a modeled distribution, informed and constrained by measurements, of accelerated
electrons as they escape the Sun. Combining the detection of microwave gyrosynchrotron emission
from an open, rather than closed, magnetic configuration, with realistic 3D modeling constrained
by magnetograms, EUV, and X-ray emission, we obtain the most stringent constraints to date on the
accelerated electrons within a solar jet.
