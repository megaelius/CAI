Jets in low-luminosity radio galaxies are known to decelerate from relativistic speeds on parsec
scales to mildly or sub-relativistic speeds on kiloparsec scales. Several mechanisms have been
proposed to explain this effect, including strong reconfinement shocks and the growth of instabilities
(both leading to boundary-layer entrainment) and mass loading from stellar winds or molecular
clouds. We have performed a series of axisymmetric simulations of the early evolution of jets in
a realistic ambient medium to probe the effects of mass loading from stellar winds using the code
Ratpenat. We study the evolution of Fanaroff-Riley Class I (FRI) jets, with kinetic powers L_j \sim
1.e41-1.e44 erg/s, within the first 2 kpc of their evolution, where deceleration by stellar mass
loading should be most effective. Mass entrainment rates consistent with present models of stellar
mass loss in elliptical galaxies produce deceleration and effective decollimation of weak FRI
jets within the first kiloparsec. However, powerful FRI jets are not decelerated significantly.
In those cases where the mass loading is important, the jets show larger opening angles and decollimate
at smaller distances, but the overall structure and dynamics of the bow-shock are similar to those
of unloaded jets with the same power and thrust. According to our results, the flaring observed on
kpc scales is initiated by mass loading in the weaker FRI jets and by reconfinement shocks or the growth
of instabilities in the more powerful jets. The final mechanism of decollimation and deceleration
is always the development of disruptive pinching modes.
