Observations of planets throughout our Solar System have revealed that the Earth is not alone in
possessing natural, inter-annual atmospheric cycles. The equatorial middle atmospheres of the
Earth, Jupiter and Saturn all exhibit a remarkably similar phenomenon - a vertical, cyclic pattern
of alternating temperatures and zonal (east-west) wind regimes that propagate slowly downwards
with a well-defined multi-Earth-year period. Earth's Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO, observed
in the lower stratospheres with an average period of 28 months) is one of the most regular, repeatable
cycles exhibited by our climate system, and yet recent work has shown that this regularity can be
disrupted by events occurring far away from the equatorial region, an example of a phenomenon known
as atmospheric teleconnection. Here we reveal that Saturn's equatorial Quasi-Periodic Oscillation
(QPO, with a ~15-year period) can also be dramatically perturbed. An intense springtime storm erupted
at Saturn's northern mid-latitudes in December 2010, spawning a gigantic hot vortex in the stratosphere
at $40^\circ$N that persisted for 3 years. Far from the storm, the Cassini temperature measurements
showed a dramatic $\sim10$-K cooling in the 0.5-5 mbar range across the entire equatorial region,
disrupting the regular QPO pattern and significantly altering the middle-atmospheric wind structure,
suggesting an injection of westward momentum into the equatorial wind system from waves generated
by the northern storm. Hence, as on Earth, meteorological activity at mid-latitudes can have a profound
effect on the regular atmospheric cycles in the tropics, demonstrating that waves can provide horizontal
teleconnections between the phenomena shaping the middle atmospheres of giant planets.
