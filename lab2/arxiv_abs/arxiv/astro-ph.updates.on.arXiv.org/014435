Context: Stars evolving through the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase provide significant feedback
to their host system, in form of both gas enriched in nuclear-burning products and dust formed in
their winds, which they eject into the interstellar medium. Therefore AGB stars are an essential
ingredient for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way and other galaxies. Aims: We study AGB models
with super-solar metallicity, to complete our large database, so far extending from metal-poor
to solar chemical compositions. We provide chemical yields for masses in the range 1-8 Msun and metallicities
Z=0.03 and Z=0.04. We also study dust production in this metallicity domain. Methods: We calculated
the evolutionary sequences from the pre main sequence through the whole AGB phase. We follow the
variation of the surface chemical composition to calculate the chemical yields of the various species
and model dust formation in the winds to determine the dust production rate and the total dust mass
produced by each star during the AGB phase. Results: The physical and chemical evolution of the star
is sensitive to the initial mass: M> 3Msun stars experience hot bottom burning, whereas the surface
chemistry of the lower mass counterparts is altered only by third dredge-up. The carbon-star phase
is reached by 2.5-3.5Msun stars of metallicity Z=0.03, whereas all the Z=0.04 stars (except the
2.5 Msun) remain O-rich for the whole AGB phase. Most of the dust produced by metal-rich AGBs is in
the form of silicates particles. The total mass of dust produced increases with the mass of the star,
reaching ~ 0.012 Msun for 8Msun stars.
