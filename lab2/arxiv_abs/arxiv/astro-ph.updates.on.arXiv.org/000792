Following the approach of the induced-matter theory, we investigate the cosmological implications
of a five-dimensional Brans-Dicke theory, and propose to explain the acceleration of the universe.
After inducing in a four-dimensional hypersurface, we classify the energy-momentum tensor into
two parts in a way that, one part represents all kind of the matter (the baryonic and dark) and the other
one contains every extra terms emerging from the scale factor of the fifth dimension and the scalar
field, which we consider as the energy-momentum tensor of dark energy. We also separate the energy-momentum
conservation equation into two conservation equations, one for matter and the other for dark energy.
We perform this procedure for different cases, without interacting term and with two particular
(suitable) interacting terms between the two parts. By assuming the parameter of the state equation
for dark energy to be constant, the equations of the model admit the power-law solutions. Though,
the non-interacting case does not give any accelerated universe, but the interacting cases give
both decelerated and accelerated universes. For the interacting cases, we figure out analytically
the acceptable ranges of some parameters of the model, and also investigate the data analysis to
test the model parameter values consistency with the observational data of the distance modulus
of 580 SNe Ia compiled in Union2.1. For one of these interacting cases, the best fitted values suggest
that the Brans-Dicke coupling constant ({\omega}) is -7.75, however, it also gives the state parameter
of dark energy (wX) equal to -0.67. In addition, the model gives the Hubble and deceleration parameters
at the present time to be H0 = 69.4 (km/s)/Mpc and q0 = -0.38 (within their confidence intervals),
where the scale factor of the fifth dimension shrinks with the time.
