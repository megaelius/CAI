The detection and characterization of primordial gravitational waves through their impact on
the polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a primary science goal
of current and future observations of the CMB. An ancillary dataset that will become accessible
with the great leaps in sensitivity of CMB experiments is the polarized Sunyaev Zel'dovich (pSZ)
effect, small-scale CMB polarization anisotropies induced by scattering from free electrons
in the post-reionization Universe. The cross correlation of the pSZ effect with galaxy surveys,
a technique known as pSZ tomography, can be used to reconstruct the remote quadrupole field: the
CMB quadrupole observed from different locations in the Universe. Primordial gravitational waves
leave a distinct imprint on the remote quadrupole field, making pSZ tomography a potential new method
to characterize their properties. Building on previous work, we explore the utility of the full
set of correlations between the primary CMB and the reconstructed remote quadrupole field to both
provide exclusion limits on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves, as well as to provide
constraints on several phenomenological models of the tensor sector: axion gauge field inflation,
general models with chiral tensors, and models with modified late-time decay of tensors. We find
that relatively futuristic experimental requirements are necessary to provide competitive exclusion
limits compared with the primary CMB. However, pSZ tomography can be a powerful probe of the late-time
evolution of tensors and, through cross-correlations with the primary CMB, can provide mild improvements
on parameter constraints in various models with chiral primordial gravitational waves.
