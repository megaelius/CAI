Gamma-ray binaries are thought to be composed of a young pulsar in orbit around a massive O or Be star,
with their gamma-ray emission powered by pulsar spindown. The number of such systems in our Galaxy
is not known. We aim to estimate the total number of gamma-ray binaries in our Galaxy and to evaluate
the prospects for new detections in the GeV and TeV energy range, taking into account that their gamma-ray
emission is modulated on the orbital period. We model the population of gamma-ray binaries and evaluate
the fraction of detected systems in surveys with the Fermi-LAT (GeV), HESS, HAWC and CTA (TeV) using
observation-based and synthetic template lightcurves. The detected fraction depends more on
the orbit-average flux than on the lightcurve shape. Our best estimate for the number of gamma-ray
binaries is 101$_{-52}^{+89}$ systems. A handful of discoveries are expected by pursuing the Fermi-LAT
survey. Discoveries in TeV surveys are less likely. However, this depends on the relative amounts
of power emitted in GeV and TeV domains. There could be as many as $\approx$200 HESS J0632+057-like
systems with a high ratio of TeV to GeV emission compared to other gamma-ray binaries. Statistics
allow for as many as three discoveries in five years of HAWC observations and five discoveries in
the first two years of the CTA Galactic Plane survey. Continued Fermi-LAT observations are favoured
over ground-based TeV surveys to find new gamma-ray binaries. Gamma-ray observations are most
sensitive to short orbital period systems with a high spindown pulsar power. Radio pulsar surveys
(SKA) are likely to be more efficient in detecting long orbital period systems, providing a complementary
probe into the gamma-ray binary population.
