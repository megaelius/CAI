We address the spatial scale, ionization structure, mass and metal content of gas at the Milky Way
disk-halo interface detected as absorption in the foreground of seven closely-spaced, high-latitude
halo blue horizontal branch stars (BHBs) with heights z = 3 - 14 kpc. We detect transitions that trace
multiple ionization states (e.g. CaII, FeII, SiIV, CIV) with column densities that remain constant
with height from the disk, indicating that the gas most likely lies within z < 3.4 kpc. The intermediate
ionization state gas traced by CIV and SiIV is strongly correlated over the full range of transverse
separations probed by our sightlines, indicating large, coherent structures greater than 1 kpc
in size. The low ionization state material traced by CaII and FeII does not exhibit a correlation
with either N$_{\rm HI}$ or transverse separation, implying cloudlets or clumpiness on scales
less than 10 pc. We find that the observed ratio log(N_SiIV/ N_CIV), with a median value of -0.69+/-0.04,
is sensitive to the total carbon content of the ionized gas under the assumption of either photoionization
or collisional ionization. The only self-consistent solution for photoionized gas requires that
Si be depleted onto dust by 0.35 dex relative to the solar Si/C ratio, similar to the level of Si depletion
in DLAs and in the Milky Way ISM. The allowed range of values for the areal mass infall rate of warm,
ionized gas at the disk-halo interface is 0.0003 < dM_gas / dtdA [M_sun kpc^-2 yr^-] < 0.006. Our data
support a physical scenario in which the Milky Way is fed by complex, multiphase processes at its
disk-halo interface that involve kpc-scale ionized envelopes or streams containing pc-scale,
cool clumps.
