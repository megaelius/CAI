The "solar-stellar connection" began as a relatively small field of research focused on understanding
the processes that generate magnetic field in stars and which sometimes lead to a cyclic pattern
of long-term variability in activity, as demonstrated by our Sun. This area of study has recently
become more broadly pertinent to questions of exoplanet habitability and exo-space weather, as
well as stellar evolution. In contrast to other areas of stellar research, individual stars in the
solar-stellar connection often have a distinct identity and character in the literature, due primarily
to the rarity of the decades-long time series that are necessary for studying stellar activity cycles.
Furthermore, the underlying stellar dynamo is not well understood theoretically, and is thought
to be sensitive to several stellar properties, e.g. luminosity, differential rotation, and depth
of the convection zone, which in turn are often parameterized by other more readily available properties.
Relevant observations are scattered throughout the literature and existing stellar databases,
and consolidating information for new studies is a tedious and laborious exercise. To accelerate
research in this area I developed sunstardb, a relational database of stellar properties and magnetic
activity proxy time series keyed by individual named stars. The organization of the data eliminates
the need for problematic catalog cross matching operations inherent when building an analysis
dataset from heterogeneous sources. In this article I describe the principles behind sunstardb,
the data structures and programming interfaces, as well as use cases from solar-stellar connection
research.
