The Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization Signature (EDGES) collaboration has
reported the detection of an absorption feature in the sky-averaged spectrum at $\approx 78$ MHz.
This signal has been interpreted as the absorption of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons
at redshifts $15 \lesssim z \lesssim 20$ by the 21cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen, whose
temperature is expected to be coupled to the gas temperature by the Wouthuysen-Field effect during
this epoch. Because the gas is colder than the CMB, the 21cm signal is seen in absorption. However,
the absorption depth is more than twice the maximal value expected in the standard cosmological
model, at $\approx 3.8\sigma$ significance. Here, we propose an explanation for this depth based
on "early dark energy" (EDE), a scenario in which an additional component with equation of state
$w=-1$ contributes to the cosmological energy density at early times, before decaying rapidly
at a critical redshift, $z_c$. For $20 \lesssim z_c \lesssim 1000$, the accelerated expansion due
to the EDE can produce an earlier decoupling of the gas temperature from the radiation temperature
than that in the standard model, giving the gas additional time to cool adiabatically before the
first luminous sources form. We show that the EDE scenario can successfully explain the large amplitude
of the EDGES signal. However, such models are strongly ruled out by observations of the CMB temperature
power spectrum. Moreover, the EDE models needed to explain the EDGES signal exacerbate the current
tension in low- and high-redshift measurements of the Hubble constant. We conclude that non-finely-tuned
modifications of the background cosmology are unlikely to explain the EDGES signal while remaining
consistent with other cosmological observations.
