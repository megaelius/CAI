In the core-accretion formation scenario of gas giants, most of the gas accreting onto a planet is
processed through an accretion shock. In this series of papers we study this shock since it is key
in setting the forming planet's structure and thus its post-formation luminosity, with dramatic
observational consequences. We perform one-dimensional grey radiation-hydrodynamical simulations
with non-equilibrium (two-temperature) radiation transport and up-to-date opacities. We survey
the parameter space of accretion rate, planet mass, and planet radius and obtain post-shock temperatures,
pressures, and entropies, as well as global radiation efficiencies. We find that usually, the shock
temperature T_shock is given by the "free-streaming" limit. At low temperatures the dust opacity
can make the shock hotter but not significantly. We corroborate this with an original semi-analytical
derivation of T_shock . We also estimate the change in luminosity between the shock and the nebula.
Neither T_shock nor the luminosity profile depend directly on the optical depth between the shock
and the nebula. Rather, T_shock depends on the immediate pre-shock opacity, and the luminosity
change on the equation of state (EOS). We find quite high immediate post-shock entropies (S ~ 13-20
kB/mH), which makes it seem unlikely that the shock can cool the planet. The global radiation efficiencies
are high (eta^phys > 97%) but the remainder of the total incoming energy, which is brought into the
planet, exceeds the internal luminosity of classical cold starts by orders of magnitude. Overall,
these findings suggest that warm or hot starts are more plausible.
