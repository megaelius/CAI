We study galaxy populations and search for possible merging substructures in the rich galaxy cluster
A2142. Normal mixture modelling revealed in A2142 several infalling galaxy groups and subclusters.
The projected phase space diagram was used to analyse the dynamics of the cluster and study the distribution
of various galaxy populations in the cluster and subclusters. The cluster, supercluster, BCGs,
and one infalling subcluster are aligned. Their orientation is correlated with the alignment of
the radio and X-ray haloes of the cluster. Galaxies in the centre of the main cluster at the clustercentric
distances $0.5~h^{-1}Mpc$ have older stellar populations (with the median age of $10 - 11$~Gyrs)
than galaxies at larger clustercentric distances. Star-forming and recently quenched galaxies
are located mostly in the infall region at the clustercentric distances $D_{\mathrm{c}} \approx
1.8~h^{-1}Mpc$, where the median age of stellar populations of galaxies is about $2$~Gyrs. Galaxies
in A2142 have higher stellar masses, lower star formation rates, and redder colours than galaxies
in other rich groups. The total mass in infalling groups and subclusters is $M \approx 6\times10^{14}h^{-1}M_\odot$,
approximately half of the mass of the cluster, sufficient for the mass growth of the cluster from
redshift $z = 0.5$ (half-mass epoch) to the present. The cluster A2142 may have formed as a result
of past and present mergers and infallen groups, predominantly along the supercluster axis. Mergers
cause complex radio and X-ray structure of the cluster and affect the properties of galaxies in the
cluster, especially in the infall region. Explaining the differences between galaxy populations,
mass, and richness of A2142, and other groups and clusters may lead to better insight about the formation
and evolution of rich galaxy clusters.
