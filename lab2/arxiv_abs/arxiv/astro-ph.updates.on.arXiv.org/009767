As of today ten circumbinary planets orbiting solar type main sequence stars have been discovered.
Nearly all of them orbit around the central binary very closely to the region of instability where
it is difficult to form them in situ. It is assumed that they formed further out and migrated to their
observed position. We extend previous studies to a more realistic thermal disc structure and determine
what parameter influence the final parking location of a planet around a binary star. We perform
two-dimensional numerical simulations of viscous accretion discs around a central binary that
include viscous heating and radiative cooling from the disc surfaces. We vary the binary eccentricity
as well as disc viscosity and mass. Concerning the disc evolution we find that it can take well over
100000 binary orbits until an equilibrium state is reached. As seen previously, we find that the
central cavity opened by the binary becomes eccentric and precesses slowly in a prograde sense.
Embedded planets migrate to the inner edge of the disc. In cases of lower disc viscosity they migrate
further in maintaining a circular orbit, while for high viscosity they are parked further out on
an eccentric orbit. The final location of an embedded planet is linked to its ability to open a gap
in the disc. Gap opening planets separate inner from outer disc, preventing eccentricity excitation
in the latter and making it more circular. This allows embedded planets to migrate closer to the binary,
in agreement with the observations. The necessary condition for gap opening and the final planet
position depend on the planet mass and disc viscosity.
