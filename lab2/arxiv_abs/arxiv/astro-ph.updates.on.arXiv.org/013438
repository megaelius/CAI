We present an HST Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) spectrum of the QSO SDSS J095109.12+330745.8
($z_{em} = 0.645$) whose sightline passes through the SMC-like dwarf galaxy UGC 5282 ($M_B = -16.0$,
$cz = 1577$ km s$^{-1}$ ), 1.2 kpc in projection from the central HII region of the galaxy. Damped Ly$\alpha$
(DLA) absorption is detected at the redshift of UGC 5282 with $\log$[$N$(HI) cm$^{-2}\:$] = 20.89$^{+0.12}_{-0.21}\:\:$.
Analysis of the accompanying SII, PII and OI metal lines yields a neutral gas metallicity, $Z_{HI}$,
of [S/H] $\simeq$ [P/H] $= -0.80\pm0.24$. The metallicity of ionized gas from the central HII region,
$Z_{HII}\:$, measured from its emission lines is [O/H]$= -0.37\pm0.10$, a difference of $+0.43\pm
0.26$ from $Z_{HI}\:$. This difference $\delta$ is consistent with that seen towards HII regions
in other star-forming galaxies and supports the idea that ionized gas near star forming regions
shows systematically higher metallicities than exist in the rest of a galaxy's neutral interstellar
medium (ISM). The positive values of $\delta$ found in UGC 5282 (and the other star forming galaxies)
is likely due to infalling low metallicity gas from the intergalactic medium that mixes with the
galaxy's ISM on kpc scales. This model is also consistent with broad Ly$\alpha$ emission detected
at the bottom of the DLA absorption, offset by $\sim 125$ km s$^{-1}$ from the absorption velocity.
Models of galaxy evolution that attempt to replicate population characteristics, such as the mass-metallicity
relation, may need to start with a galaxy metallicity represented by $Z_{HI}$ rather than that measured
traditionally from $Z_{HII}\:$.
