The spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background follows Planck's black body radiation formula
and shows a remarkable constant temperature of T = 2.7. About 380 000 years after the Big Bang at a temperature
of T = 3000 Kelvin in the matter dominated era the electrons combine with the protons and 4He and the
photons move freely in the neutral universe. So the temperature and distribution of the photons
give us information of the universe 380 000 years after the Big Bang. Information about earlier times
can, in principle, be derived from the Cosmic Neutrino Background (relic neutrinos). The neutrinos
decouple already about 1 second after the Big Bang at a temperature of around 1 MeV or 10^{10} Kelvin.
Today their temperature is about 1.95 Kelvin. Registration of these neutrinos is an extremely challenging
experimental problem, which can hardly be solved with the present technologies. On the other hand
it represents a tempting opportunity to check one of key elements of the Big Bang Cosmology and to
probe the early stages of the universe evolution. The search for the Cosmic Neutrino Background
with the induced beta decay: relic neutrino + 3H --> 3He + e-, is the topic of this contribution.
The signal would show up as a peak in the electron spectrum by an energy with the neutrino mass above
the Q value. We discuss the prospects of this approach and argue that it is able to set limits on the
Cosmic Neutrino density in our vicinity. We also discuss critically ways to increase with modifications
of the present KATRIN spectrometer the Tritium source intensity by a factor 100, which would yield
about 170 counts of relic neutrino captures per year. Presently such an increase of the Tritium source
intensity seems not to be possible. But one should be able to find an upper limit for the local density
of the relic neutrinos in our galaxy.
