The detection of periodic signals from transiting exoplanets is often impeded by extraneous aperiodic
photometric variability, either intrinsic to the star or arising from the measurement process.
Frequently, these variations are autocorrelated wherein later flux values are correlated with
previous ones. In this work, we present the methodology of the Autoregessive Planet Search (ARPS)
project which uses Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and related statistical
models that treat a wide variety of stochastic processes, as well as nonstationarity, to improve
detection of new planetary transits. Providing a time series is evenly spaced or can be placed on
an evenly spaced grid with missing values, these low-dimensional parametric models can prove very
effective. We introduce a planet-search algorithm to detect periodic transits in the residuals
after the application of ARIMA models. Our matched-filter algorithm, the Transit Comb Filter (TCF),
is closely related to the traditional Box-fitting Least Squares and provides an analogous periodogram.
Finally, if a previously identified or simulated sample of planets is available, selected scalar
features from different stages of the analysis -- the original light curves, ARIMA fits, TCF periodograms,
and folded light curves -- can be collectively used with a multivariate classifier to identify promising
candidates while efficiently rejecting false alarms. We use Random Forests for this task, in conjunction
with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, to define discovery criteria for new, high
fidelity planetary candidates. The ARPS methodology can be applied to both evenly spaced satellite
light curves and densely cadenced ground-based photometric surveys.
