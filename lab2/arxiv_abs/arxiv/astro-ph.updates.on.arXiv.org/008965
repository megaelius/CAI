Segmented telescopes are a possibility to enable large-aperture space telescopes for the direct
imaging and spectroscopy of habitable worlds. However, the complexity of their aperture geometry,
due to the central obstruction, support structures and segment gaps, makes high-contrast imaging
challenging. The High-contrast Imager for Complex Aperture Telescopes (HiCAT) testbed was designed
to study and develop solutions for such telescope pupils using wavefront control and coronagraphic
starlight suppression. The testbed design has the flexibility to enable studies with increasing
complexity for telescope aperture geometries: off-axis telescopes, on-axis telescopes with
central obstruction and support structures - e.g. the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST)
- to on-axis segmented telescopes, including various concepts for a Large UV, Optical, IR telescope
(LUVOIR). In the past year, HiCAT has made significant hardware and software updates to accelerate
the development of the project. In addition to completely overhauling the software that runs the
testbed, we have completed several hardware upgrades, including the second and third deformable
mirror, and the first custom Apodized Pupil Lyot Coronagraph (APLC) optimized for the HiCAT aperture,
which is similar to one of the possible geometries considered for LUVOIR. The testbed also includes
several external metrology features for rapid replacement of parts, and in particular the ability
to test multiple apodizers readily, an active tip-tilt control system to compensate for local vibration
and air turbulence in the enclosure. On the software and operations side, the software infrastructure
enables 24/7 automated experiments that include routine calibration tasks and high-contrast
experiments. We present an overview and status update of the project, on the hardware and software
side, and describe results obtained with APLC WFC.
