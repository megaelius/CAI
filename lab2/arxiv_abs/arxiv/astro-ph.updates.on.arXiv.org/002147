We present a generic inference method for inflation models from observational data by the usage
of higher-order statistics of the curvature perturbation on uniform density hypersurfaces. This
method is based on the calculation of the posterior for the primordial non-Gaussianity parameters
$f_\text{NL}$ and $g_\text{NL}$, which in general depend on specific parameters of inflation
and reheating models, and enables to discriminate among the still viable inflation models. To keep
analyticity as far as possible to dispense with numerically expensive sampling techniques a saddle-point
approximation is introduced, whose precision is validated for a numerical toy example. The mathematical
formulation is done in a generic way so that the approach remains applicable to cosmic microwave
background data as well as to large scale structure data. Additionally, we review a few currently
interesting inflation models and present numerical toy examples thereof in two and three dimensions
to demonstrate the efficiency of the higher-order statistics method. A second quantity of interest
is the primordial power spectrum. Here, we present two Bayesian methods to infer it from observational
data, the so called critical filter and an extension thereof with smoothness prior, both allowing
for a non-parametric spectrum reconstruction. These methods are able to reconstruct the spectra
of the observed perturbations and the primordial ones of curvature perturbation even in case of
non-Gaussianity and partial sky coverage. We argue that observables like $T-$ and $B-$modes permit
to measure both spectra. This also allows to infer the level of non-Gaussianity generated since
inflation.
