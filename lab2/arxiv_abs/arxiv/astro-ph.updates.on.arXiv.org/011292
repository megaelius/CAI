We present $81$ near-infrared (NIR) spectra of $30$ Type II supernovae (SNe~II) from the \textit{Carnegie
Supernova Project-II} (CSP-II), the largest such dataset published to date. We identify a number
of NIR features and characterize their evolution over time. The NIR spectroscopic properties of
SNe II fall into two distinct groups. This classification is first based on the strength of the He\,{\footnotesize
I} $\lambda1.083\,\mu$m absorption during the plateau phase; SNe~II are either significantly
above (spectroscopically \emph{strong}) or below $50$ \AA{} (spectroscopically \emph{weak})
in pseudo equivalent width. However between the two groups, other properties, such as the timing
of CO formation and the presence of Sr\,{\footnotesize II}, are also observed. Most surprisingly,
the distinct \emph{weak} and \emph{strong} NIR spectroscopic classes correspond to SNe~II with
slow and fast declining light curves, respectively. These two photometric groups match the modern
nomenclature of SNe~IIP and IIL. Including NIR spectra previously published, 18 out of 19 SNe~II
follow this slow declining-spectroscopically \emph{weak} and fast declining-spectroscopically
\emph{strong} correspondence. This is in apparent contradiction to the recent findings in the
optical that slow and fast decliners show a continuous distribution of properties. The \emph{weak}
SNe~II show a high-velocity component of helium that may be caused by a thermal excitation from a
reverse-shock created by the outer ejecta interacting with the red supergiant wind, but the origin
of the observed dichotomy is not understood. Further studies are crucial in determining whether
the apparent differences in the NIR are due to distinct physical processes or a gap in the current
data set.
