We extend the quark mean-field (QMF) model for nuclear matter and study the possible presence of
quark matter inside the cores of neutron stars. The QMF model relates consistently the dynamics
of the internal quark structure of a nucleon to the relativistic mean-fields arising in nuclear
matter, and can satisfy empirical constraints from both low-density nuclear experiments and neutron
star observations. The study on a first-order hadron-quark phase transition is performed, combining
the QMF for the hadronic phase with ``constant-speed-of-sound'' parameterization for the high-density
quark phase. The interplay of the nuclear symmetry energy slope parameter, $L$, and the dimensionless
phase transition parameters (the transition density $n_{\rm trans}/n_0$, the transition strength
$\Delta\varepsilon/\varepsilon_{\rm trans}$, and the sound speed squared in quark matter $c^2_{\rm
QM}$) are then systematically explored for the hybrid star proprieties, especially the maximum
mass $M_{\rm max}$ and the radius and the tidal deformability of a typical $1.4 M_{\odot}$ star $R_{\rm
1.4}$. We show the strong correlation between the symmetry energy slope and the typical stellar
radius, similar to that previously found for neutron stars without a phase transition. With the
inclusion of phase transition, we obtain robust limits on the maximum mass ($M_{\rm max}< 3.6 M_{\odot}$)
and the radius of $1.4 M_{\odot}$ stars ($R_{\rm 1.4}\gtrsim 9.6~\rm km$), and we find that the phase
transition should not take place below $\approx1.31$ times the nuclear saturation density. We
also demonstrate that future measurements of the radius and tidal deformability of $\sim 1.4 M_{\odot}$
stars, as well as the mass measurement of very massive pulsars, can help reveal the presence and amount
of quark matter in compact objects.
