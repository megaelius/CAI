Present-day clusters are massive halos containing mostly quiescent galaxies, while distant protoclusters
are extended structures containing numerous star-forming galaxies. We investigate the implications
of this fundamental change in a cosmological context using a set of N-body simulations and semi-analytic
models. We find that the fraction of the cosmic volume occupied by all (proto)clusters increases
by nearly three orders of magnitude from z=0 to z=7. We show that (proto)cluster galaxies are an important,
and even dominant population at high redshift, as their expected contribution to the cosmic star-formation
rate density rises (from 1% at z=0) to 20% at z=2 and 50% at z=10. Protoclusters thus provide a significant
fraction of the cosmic ionizing photons, and may have been crucial in driving the timing and topology
of cosmic reionization. Internally, the average history of cluster formation can be described
by three distinct phases: at z~10-5, galaxy growth in protoclusters proceeded in an inside-out
manner, with centrally dominant halos that are among the most active regions in the Universe; at
z~5-1.5, rapid star formation occurred within the entire 10-20 Mpc structures, forming most of
their present-day stellar mass; at z<~1.5, violent gravitational collapse drove these stellar
contents into single cluster halos, largely erasing the details of cluster galaxy formation due
to relaxation and virialization. Our results motivate observations of distant protoclusters
in order to understand the rapid, extended stellar growth during Cosmic Noon, and their connection
to reionization during Cosmic Dawn.
