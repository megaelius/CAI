The Gaia-ESO Survey is obtaining high-quality spectroscopic data for about 10^5 stars using FLAMES
at the VLT. UVES high-resolution spectra are being collected for about 5000 FGK-type stars. These
UVES spectra are analyzed in parallel by several state-of-the-art methodologies. Our aim is to
present how these analyses were implemented, to discuss their results, and to describe how a final
recommended parameter scale is defined. We also discuss the precision (method-to-method dispersion)
and accuracy (biases with respect to the reference values) of the final parameters. These results
are part of the Gaia-ESO 2nd internal release and will be part of its 1st public release of advanced
data products. The final parameter scale is tied to the one defined by the Gaia benchmark stars, a
set of stars with fundamental atmospheric parameters. A set of open and globular clusters is used
to evaluate the physical soundness of the results. Each methodology is judged against the benchmark
stars to define weights in three different regions of the parameter space. The final recommended
results are the weighted-medians of those from the individual methods. The recommended results
successfully reproduce the benchmark stars atmospheric parameters and the expected Teff-log
g relation of the calibrating clusters. Atmospheric parameters and abundances have been determined
for 1301 FGK-type stars observed with UVES. The median of the method-to-method dispersion of the
atmospheric parameters is 55 K for Teff, 0.13 dex for log g, and 0.07 dex for [Fe/H]. Systematic biases
are estimated to be between 50-100 K for Teff, 0.10-0.25 dex for log g, and 0.05-0.10 dex for [Fe/H].
Abundances for 24 elements were derived: C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu,
Zn, Y, Zr, Mo, Ba, Nd, and Eu. The typical method-to-method dispersion of the abundances varies between
0.10 and 0.20 dex.
