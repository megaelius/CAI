We report a new evaluation of the accretion properties of PDS~70b obtained with VLT/MUSE. The main
difference from previous studies in Haffert et al. (2019) and Aoyama & Ikoma (2019) is in the mass
accretion rate. Simultaneous multiple line observations, such as H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$, can
better constrain the physical properties of an accreting planet. While we clearly detected H$\alpha$
emissions from PDS~70b, no H$\beta$ emissions were detected. We estimate the line flux of H$\beta$
with a 3-$\sigma$ upper limit to be 2.3~$\times$~10$^{-16}$~erg~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$. The flux
ratio $F_{\rm H\beta}$/$F_{\rm H\alpha}$ for PDS~70b is $<$~0.28. Numerical investigations
by Aoyama et al. (2018) suggest that $F_{\rm H\beta}$/$F_{\rm H\alpha}$ should be close to unity
if the extinction is negligible. We attribute the reduction of the flux ratio to the extinction,
and estimate the extinction of H$\alpha$ ($A_{\rm H\alpha}$) for PDS~70b to be $>$~2.0~mag using
the interstellar extinction value. %The expected $A_{\rm H\alpha}$ value in the gap of the protoplanetary
disk at the PDS~70b location is 2.4~mag, which is consistent with the estimated extinction. By combining
with the H$\alpha$ linewidth and the dereddening line luminosity of H$\alpha$, %we derive the PDS~70b
dynamical mass and mass accretion rate to be \hashimotor{12~$\pm$~3~$M_{\rm Jup}$} and $\gtrsim$~5~$\times$~10$^{-7}$~$M_{\rm
Jup}$~yr$^{-1}$, respectively. we derive the PDS~70b mass accretion rate to be $\gtrsim$~5~$\times$~10$^{-7}$~$M_{\rm
Jup}$~yr$^{-1}$. The PDS~70b mass accretion rate is an order of magnitude larger than that of PDS~70.
We found that the filling factor $f_{\rm f}$ (the fractional area of the planetary surface emitting
H$\alpha$) is $\gtrsim$0.01, which is similar to the typical stellar value. The small value of $f_{\rm
f}$ indicates that the H$\alpha$ emitting areas are localized at the surface of PDS~70b.
