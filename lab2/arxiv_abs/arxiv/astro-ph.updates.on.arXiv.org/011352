In order to understand the diversity of classes observed in active galactic nuclei (AGN), a geometrically
and optically thick torus of gas and dust is required to obscure the central engine depending on the
line of sight to the observer. We perform a simultaneous fitting of X-ray and mid-infrared (mid-IR)
spectra to investigate if the same structure could produce both emissions and, if this the case,
to obtain better constraints for the physical parameters of the torus. In this case, we take advantage
of the fact that both emissions show important signatures of obscuration. We used the nearby type-2
active nucleus IC 5063 as a test object. This object is ideal because of the wealth of archival data
including some high resolution data. It also has a relatively high AGN luminosity that dominates
at both X-ray and mid-IR frequencies. We use high spectral resolution NuSTAR and IRS/Spitzer spectra.
The AGN dusty models used several physically motivated models. We found that the combination of
the smooth torus models at mid-IR by Fritz et al. (2006) and at X-rays by Balokovi\'c et al. (2018),
with the viewing and half-opening angles linked to the same value, is the best choice to fit the spectra
at both wavelengths. This allows us to determine all the parameters of its torus. This result suggests
that the structure producing the continuum emission at mid-IR and the reflection component at X-ray
is the same. Therefore, we prove that this technique can be used to infer the physical properties
of the torus, at least when AGN dust dominates the mid-IR emission and the reflection component is
significant at X-rays.
