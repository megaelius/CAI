As recent observations of the molecular discs in spiral galaxies point to the existence of a diffuse,
low-density thick molecular disc along with the prominent thin one, we investigate the observational
signatures of this thick disc by theoretically modelling two-component molecular discs in a sample
of eight nearby spiral galaxies. Assuming a prevailing hydrostatic equilibrium, we set up and solved
the joint Poisson's-Boltzmann equation to estimate the three-dimensional distribution of the
molecular gas and the molecular scale height in our sample galaxies. The molecular scale height
in a two-component molecular disc is found to vary between $50-300$ pc, which is higher than what
is found in a single-component disc. We find that this scale height can vary significantly depending
on the assumed thick disc molecular gas fraction. We also find that the molecular gas flares as a function
of the radius and follows a tight exponential law with a scale length of $\left(0.48 \pm 0.01 \right)
r_{25}$. We used the density solutions to produce the column density maps and spectral cubes to examine
the ideal observing conditions to identify a thick molecular disc in galaxies. We find that unless
the molecular disc is an edge-on system and imaged with a high spatial resolution ($\lesssim 100$
pc), it is extremely hard to identify a thick molecular disc in a column density map. The spectral
analysis further reveals that at moderate to high inclination ($i \gtrsim 40^o$), spectral broadening
can fictitiously introduce the signatures of a two-component disc into the spectral cube of a single-component
disc. Hence, we conclude that a low inclination molecular disc imaged with high spatial resolution
would serve as the ideal site for identifying the thick molecular disc in galaxies.
