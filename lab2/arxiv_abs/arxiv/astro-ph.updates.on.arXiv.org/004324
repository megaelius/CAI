Since the report of the PeV-TeV neutrinos by the IceCube Collaboration, various particle physics
models have been proposed to explain the neutrino spectrum by dark matter particles decaying into
neutrinos and other Standard Model particles.In such scenarios, simultaneous $\gamma$-ray emission
is commonly expected. Therefore, multi-messenger connections are generally important for the
indirect searches of dark matters. The recent development of $\gamma$-ray astronomy puts stringent
constraints on the properties of dark matter, especially by observations with the Fermi $\gamma$-ray
satellite in the last several years. Motivated by the lack of $\gamma$-ray as well as the shape of
the neutrino spectrum observed by IceCube, we discuss a scenario in which the DM is a PeV scale particle
which couples strongly to other invisible particles and its decay products do not contain a charged
particle. As an example to realize such possibilities, we consider a model of fermionic dark matter
that decays into a neutrino and many invisible fermions. The dark matter decay is secluded in the
sense that the emitted products are mostly neutrinos and dark fermions. One remarkable feature
of this model is the resulting broadband neutrino spectra around the energy scale of the dark matter.
We apply this model to multi-PeV dark matter, and discuss possible observable consequences in light
of the IceCube data. In particular, this model could account for the large flux at medium energies
of $\sim10-100$ TeV, possibly as well as the second peak at PeV, without violating the stringent
$\gamma$-ray constraints from Fermi and air-shower experiments such as CASA-MIA.
