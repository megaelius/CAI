After its launch, a GRB jet propagates through a dense medium prior to its breakout. The interaction
of the jet with the medium gives rise to the formation of a complex structured outflow, often referred
to as a "structured jet". This structure is essential for our understanding of GRBs as it ultimately
dictates their emission signatures. However, to date, the underlying physics which sets the post-breakout
jet morphology remained unexplored, and its modeling has been mainly done by assuming ad-hoc functions.
Here, using a set of 3D simulations we follow the evolution of hydrodynamic long and short GRB jets
after breakout and provide a physically motivated post-breakout outflow structure of GRB jets
(the structure of weakly magnetized jets is underway). Our simulations feature Rayleigh-Taylor
fingers, which grow from the cocoon into the jet and destabilize it. The mixing of jet-cocoon material
gives rise to a previously unidentified region between the two, which we denote the jet-cocoon interface
(JCI). In lGRBs the mixing is strong, leading to most of the outflow energy to drift into the JCI. In
sGRBs, where the medium is lighter, the mixing is weaker, and the JCI and the jet core hold a comparable
amount of energy. Remarkably, the jet structure (core and JCI) in all systems can be characterized
by simple angular power-law distributions of power and velocity, with power-law indices that depend
solely on the level of mixing. This result supports the commonly used power-law angular distribution,
and disfavors a Gaussian jet modeling. At larger angles, where the cocoon dominates, the structure
is more complex including both an angular and a radial structure. The mixing shapes the prompt light
curve and implies that typical afterglows of lGRBs are different from those of sGRBs. The predictions
that we provide can be used to infer jet characteristics from prompt and afterglow observations.
