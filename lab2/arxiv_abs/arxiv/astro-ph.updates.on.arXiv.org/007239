Many round or nearly roundish Planetary Nebulae (PNe) show multiple shells and halo structures
during their evolutionary stage near the maximum temperature of their central star. Controversial
debate is currently ongoing if these structures are recombination halos, as suggested by hydrodynamic
modelling efforts, or ionized material. Recently we discovered a halo with even somewhat unusual
structures around the sparsely studied PN IC~5148 and present for the first time spectroscopy going
out to the halo of such a PN.} resolution spectroscopy is used to derive dust chemistry and mineralogy.
We investigate the spatial distribution of material and its ionization state from the center of
the nebula up to the very outskirts of the halo. We obtained long-slit low resolution spectroscopy
(FORS2@VLT) of the nebula in two position angles, which we used to investigate the nebular structure
and its halo in the optical range from 450 to 880\,nm. In addition we used medium resolution spectra
taken with X-SHOOTER@VLT ranging from 320 nm to 2.4 mu to derive atmospheric parameters for the central
star. We obtained the distance and position in the Galaxy from various methods combined with GAIA
DR2 data. We also applied Cloudy models to the nebula in order to derive physical parameters of the
various regions. We obtained spatially resolved structures and detailed descriptions of the outrunning
shock front and a set of unusual halo structures denoted to further shock. The halo structures appears
clearly as hot ionized material. Furthermore we derived a reliable photometric value for the central
star at a GAIA distance of D=1.3kpc. Considering the large distance $z=1.0$\,kpc from the galactic
plane together to its non-circular motion in the galaxy and, a metallicity only slightly below that
of typical disk PNe, most likely IC 5148 originates from a thick disk population star.
