We report radial speed evolution of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) detected by
the SOHO/LASCO coronagraph, interplanetary scintillation (IPS) at 327 MHz, and in-situ observations.
In this study, we analyze solar wind disturbance factor (g-value) data derived from IPS observations
during 1997-2009 covering nearly whole period of Solar Cycle 23. By comparing observations from
the SOHO/LASCO, IPS, and in-situ, we then identify 39 ICMEs that could be analyzed carefully. Here,
we define two speeds VSOHO and Vbg that are initial speed of ICME and the speed of background solar
wind, respectively. Examinations for them yield the following results; 1) Fast ICMEs (with VSOHO
- Vbg > 500 km/s) rapidly decelerate, moderate ICMEs (with 0 km/s < VSOHO - Vbg < 500 km/s)
show either gradually decelerating or uniform motion, and slow ICMEs (with VSOHO - Vbg < 0 km/s)
accelerate. The radial speeds converge on the speed of background solar wind during their outward
propagation. We subsequently find; 2) both the acceleration and deceleration are nearly complete
by 0.79 (+- 0.04)AU, and those are ended when the ICME speed reaches a given speed. We find the value
of that to be 480 (+- 21) km/s. 3) For the fast and moderate ICMEs, a linear equation with a constant
coefficient is more appropriate than a quadratic equation to describe the kinematics of them, because
the chi-square for the linear equation satisfies the statistical significance level of 0.05, while
the quadratic one is not. These results support the hypothesis that the radial motion of ICMEs is
governed by a drag force due to interaction with the background solar wind. These findings also suggest
that ICMEs propagating faster than background solar wind are controlled mainly by the hydrodynamic
Stokes' drag.
