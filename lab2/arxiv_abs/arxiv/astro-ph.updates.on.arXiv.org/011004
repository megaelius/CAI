We introduce a new method for evaluating the oscillatory integrals which describe natural interference
patterns. As an illustrative example of contemporary interest, we consider astrophysical plasma
lensing of coherent sources like pulsars and fast radio bursts in radioastronomy. Plasma lenses
are known to occur near the source, in the interstellar medium, as well as in the solar wind and the
earth's ionosphere. Such lensing is strongest at long wavelengths hence it is generally important
to go beyond geometric optics and into the full wave optics regime. Our computational method is a
spinoff of new techniques two of us, and our collaborators, have developed for defining and performing
Lorentzian path integrals. Cauchy's theorem allows one to transform a computationally fragile
and expensive, highly oscillatory integral into an exactly equivalent sum of absolutely and rapidly
convergent integrals which can be evaluated in polynomial time. We require only that it is possible
to analytically continue the lensing phase, expressed in the integrated coordinates, into the
complex domain. We give a first-principles derivation of the Fresnel-Kirchhoff integral, starting
from Feynman's path integral for a massless particle in a refractive medium. We then demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method by computing the interference patterns of Thom's caustic catastrophes,
both in their "normal forms" and within a variety of more realistic, local lens models, over all wavelengths.
Our numerical method, implemented in a freely downloadable code, provides a fast, accurate tool
for modeling interference patterns in radioastronomy and other fields of physics.
