The formation process of high-mass stars (>8M$_\odot$) is poorly constrained, particularly,
the effects of clump fragmentation creating multiple systems and the mechanism of mass accretion
onto the cores. We study the fragmentation of dense gas clumps, and trace the circumstellar rotation
and outflows by analyzing observations of the high-mass (~500M$_\odot$) star-forming region
IRAS 23033+5951. Using the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) in three configurations
and the IRAM 30-m single-dish telescope at 220GHz, we probe the gas and dust emission at an angular
resolution of ~0.45arcsec, corresponding to 1900au. In the mm continuum emission, we identify
a protostellar cluster with at least four mm-sources, where three of them show a significantly higher
peak intensity well above a signal-to-noise ratio of 100. Hierarchical fragmentation from large
to small spatial scales is discussed. Two fragments are embedded in rotating structures and drive
molecular outflows, traced by $^{13}$CO (2-1) emission. The velocity profiles across two of the
cores are similar to Keplerian but are missing the highest velocity components close to the center
of rotation, which is a common phenomena from observations like these, and other rotation scenarios
are not excluded entirely. Position-velocity diagrams suggest protostellar masses of ~6 and 19M$_\sun$.
Rotational temperatures from fitting CH$_3$CN ($12_K-11_K$) spectra are used for estimating
the gas temperature and by that the disk stability against gravitational fragmentation, utilizing
Toomre's $Q$ parameter. [We] identify only one candidate disk to be unstable against gravitational
instability caused by axisymmetric perturbations. The dominant sources cover different evolutionary
stages within the same maternal gas clump. The appearance of rotation and outflows of the cores are
similar to those found in low-mass star-forming regions.
