One of the main goals of solar physics is the timely identification of eruptive active regions. Space
missions such as Solar Orbiter or future Space Weather forecasting missions would largely benefit
from this achievement. Our aim is to produce a relatively simple technique that can provide real
time indications or predictions that an active region will produce an eruption. We expand on the
theoretical work of \citet{Pagano2019fp} that was able to distinguish eruptive from non-eruptive
active regions. From this we introduce a new operational metric that uses a combination of observed
line-of-sight magnetograms, 3D data-driven simulations and the projection of the 3D simulations
forward in time. Results show that the new metric correctly distinguishes active regions as eruptive
when observable signatures of eruption have been identified and as non-eruptive when there are
no observable signatures of eruption. After successfully distinguishing eruptive from non-eruptive
active regions we illustrate how this metric may be used in a "real-time" operational sense were
three levels of warning are categorised. These categories are: high risk (red), medium risk (amber)
and low risk (green) of eruption. Through considering individual cases we find that the separation
into eruptive and non-eruptive active regions is more robust the longer the time series of observed
magnetograms used to simulate the build up of magnetic stress and free magnetic energy within the
active region. Finally, we conclude that this proof of concept study delivers promising results
where the ability to categorise the risk of an eruption is a major achievement.
