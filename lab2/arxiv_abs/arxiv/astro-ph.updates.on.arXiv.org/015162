The partial ionization of the solar plasma causes several nonideal effects such as the ambipolar
diffusion, the Hall effect, and the Biermann battery effect. Here we report on the first three-dimensional
realistic simulations of solar local dynamo where all three effects were taken into account. The
simulations started with a snapshot of already saturated battery-seeded dynamo, where two new
series were developed: one with solely ambipolar diffusion and another one also taking into account
the Hall term in the generalized Ohm's law. The simulations were then run for about 4 hours of solar
time to reach the stationary regime and improve the statistics. In parallel, a purely MHD dynamo
simulation was also run for the same amount of time. The simulations are compared in a statistical
way. The results show that, with the inclusion of the ambipolar diffusion, the amplitudes of the
incompressible perturbations related to Alfven waves are reduced, and the Poynting flux is absorbed,
with a frequency dependence. The Hall effect causes the opposite action: significant excess of
incompressible perturbations is generated and an excess of the Poynting flux is observed in the
chromospheric layers. The model with ambipolar diffusion shows, on average, sharper current sheets
and slightly more abundant fast magneto-acoustic shocks in the chromosphere. The model with the
Hall effect has higher temperatures at the lower chromosphere and stronger and more vertical magnetic
field concentrations all over the chromosphere. The study of high-frequency waves reveals that
significant power of incompressible perturbations is associated with areas with intense and more
vertical magnetic fields and larger temperatures. We find a positive correlation between the magnitude
of the ambipolar heating and the temperature increase at the same location after a characteristic
time of 10^2 sec.
