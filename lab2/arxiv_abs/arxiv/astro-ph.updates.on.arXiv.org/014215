We explore how to mitigate the clustering distortions in Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) samples
caused by the miss-identification of the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) wavelength in their Ly$\alpha$
line profiles. We use the Ly$\alpha$ line profiles from our previous LAE theoretical model that
includes radiative transfer in the interstellar and intergalactic mediums. We introduce a novel
approach to measure the systemic redshift of LAEs from their Ly$\alpha$ line using neural networks.
In detail, we assume that, for a fraction of the whole LAE population their systemic redshift is determined
precisely through other spectral features. We then use this subset to train a neural network that
predicts the Ly$\alpha$ wavelength given a Ly$\alpha$ line profile. We test two different training
sets: i) the LAEs are selected homogeneously and ii) only the brightest LAEs are selected. In comparison
with previous approaches in the literature, our methodology improves significantly both accuracy
and precision in determining the Ly$\alpha$ wavelength. In fact, after applying our algorithm
in ideal Ly$\alpha$ line profiles, we recover the clustering unperturbed down to 1cMpc/h. Then,
we test the performance of our methodology in realistic Ly$\alpha$ line profiles by downgrading
their quality. The machine learning techniques work well even if the Ly$\alpha$ line profile quality
is decreased considerably. We conclude that LAE surveys such as HETDEX would benefit from determining
with high accuracy the systemic redshift of a subpopulation and applying our methodology to estimate
the systemic redshift of the rest of the galaxy sample.
