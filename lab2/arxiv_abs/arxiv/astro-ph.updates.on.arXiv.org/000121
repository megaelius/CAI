We describe a morphological imprint of magnetization found when considering the relative orientation
of the magnetic field direction with respect to the density structures in simulated turbulent molecular
clouds. This imprint was found using the Histogram of Relative Orientations (HRO): a new technique
that utilizes the gradient to characterize the directionality of density and column density structures
on multiple scales. We present results of the HRO analysis in three models of molecular clouds in
which the initial magnetic field strength is varied, but an identical initial turbulent velocity
field is introduced, which subsequently decays. The HRO analysis was applied to the simulated data
cubes and mock-observations of the simulations produced by integrating the data cube along particular
lines of sight. In the 3D analysis we describe the relative orientation of the magnetic field with
respect to the density structures, showing that: 1.The magnetic field shows a preferential orientation
parallel to most of the density structures in the three simulations. 2.The relative orientation
changes from parallel to perpendicular in regions with density over a critical density $n_{T}$
in the highest magnetization case. 3.The change in the relative orientation is largest for the highest
magnetization and decreases in the lower magnetization cases. This effect is also present in the
projected maps, where we consider the relative orientation of column density structures and polarization
pseudovectors. The described change in the relative orientation of the magnetic field is potentially
measurable using submillimeter polarization observations of molecular clouds and can be used
to complement the estimates of magnetic field strength found with techniques based on the Chandrasekhar-Fermi
method.
