We present the detection and characterization of the full-orbit phase curve and secondary eclipse
of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-33b at optical wavelengths, along with the pulsation spectrum of
the host star. We analyzed data collected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) during
Sector 18. WASP-33b belongs to a very short list of highly irradiated exoplanets that were discovered
from the ground and were afterwards visited by TESS. WASP-33b's host star, of delta Scuti type, shows
non-radial pulsations in the milli-magnitude regime, with periods comparable to that of the primary
transit. Carrying out a detailed determination of the pulsation spectrum of the host star, we find
29 pulsation frequencies with a signal-to-noise ratio higher than 4. After cleaning the light curve
for the stellar pulsations we confidently report a secondary eclipse depth of 305.8 +/- 35.5 parts-per-million
(ppm), along with an amplitude of the phase curve of 100.4 +/- 13.1 ppm and a corresponding westward
offset between the region of maximum brightness and the substellar point of 28.7 +/- 7.1 degrees,
making WASP-33b one of the few planets with such an offset found so far. Our derived Bond albedo, A_B
= 0.369 +/- 0.050, and heat recirculation efficiency, epsilon = 0.189 +/- 0.014, reconfirm WASP-33b
to be similar in behaviour to other hot Jupiters, despite the high irradiation received from its
host star. Connecting the amplitude of the phase curve to the primary transit and secondary eclipse
depths, we determine the day and night side brightness temperatures of WASP-33b to be 3014 +/- 60
K and 1605 +/- 45 K, respectively. From the detection of photometric variations due to gravitational
interactions, we estimated a planet mass of M_P = 2.81 +/- 0.53 M_Jup. Analyzing the stellar pulsations
in the frame of the planetary orbit, we find no signals of star-planet interactions.
