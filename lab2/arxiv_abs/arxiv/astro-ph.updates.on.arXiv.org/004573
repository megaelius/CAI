The study of polarized dust emission has become entwined with the analysis of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) polarization. We use new Planck maps to characterize Galactic dust emission as
a foreground to the CMB polarization. We present Planck EE, BB, and TE power spectra of dust polarization
at 353 GHz for six nested sky regions covering from 24 to 71 % of the sky. We present power-law fits to
the angular power spectra, yielding evidence for statistically significant variations of the
exponents over sky regions and a difference between the values for the EE and BB spectra. The TE correlation
and E/B power asymmetry extend to low multipoles that were not included in earlier Planck polarization
papers. We also report evidence for a positive TB dust signal. Combining data from Planck and WMAP,
we determine the amplitudes and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of polarized foregrounds,
including the correlation between dust and synchrotron polarized emission, for the six sky regions
as a function of multipole. This quantifies the challenge of the component separation procedure
required for detecting the reionization and recombination peaks of primordial CMB B modes. The
SED of polarized dust emission is fit well by a single-temperature modified blackbody emission
law from 353 GHz to below 70 GHz. For a dust temperature of 19.6 K, the mean spectral index for dust polarization
is $\beta_{\rm d}^{P} = 1.53\pm0.02 $. By fitting multi-frequency cross-spectra, we examine the
correlation of the dust polarization maps across frequency. We find no evidence for decorrelation.
If the Planck limit for the largest sky region applies to the smaller sky regions observed by sub-orbital
experiments, then decorrelation might not be a problem for CMB experiments aiming at a primordial
B-mode detection limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r\simeq0.01$ at the recombination peak.
