Cosmological observations such as structure formation, CMB, and cosmic distance ladder set tight
constraints to the amount and nature of dark matter (DM). In particular structure formation strongly
constraints not only the amount of energy density, but also the time when DM became non-relativistic,
anr. Standard cold and thermic warm DM particles have a smooth transition from being relativistic
at high energies to a non-relativistic regime since the mass of these particles is constant while
the velocity redshifts with the expansion of the universe. However, here we explore the possibility
that the DM particle acquires a non-perturbative mass at a phase transition scale and a scale factor
ac. This transition acquired a more fundamental meaning for the Bound Dark Matter (BDM) model because
they describe a particle getting its mass through a non-perturbative process. These BDM particles
may go from being relativistic to non-relativistic at ac, which implies an abrupt transition of
the velocity of the particles vc at that time, affecting the equation of state and the cosmological
evolution. Here we study the cosmological impact of the values of vc and the scale transition ac and
they by reducing the free-streaming scale and therefore the small scale structure. Using CMB Plank,
Supernovae SNIa, and BAO data, we constrain the valid region in the parameter space ac-vc putting
upper bounds to ac but not restricting vc. For instance, the transition must be ac<$2.66\times10^{-6}$
for vc = 0. We also find that the free-streaming and the Jeans mass of the dark matter particle is highly
influenced by the velocity vc, for example, a 3 keV WDM have a Jeans mass of Mfs=$1.97\times10^7$
Msun/h^3 but an equivalent BDM with the same anr but an abrupt transition in the velocity, vc~0 would
have a Jeans mass of Mfs=$2.08x10^4$ Msun/h^3 which significantly changes the large scale structure
formation.
