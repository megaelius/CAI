The statistical analysis of large sample of strong lensing events can be a powerful tool to extract
astrophysical and/or cosmological valuable information. However, the number of such events is
still relatively low, mostly because of the lengthily observational validation process on individual
events. In this work we propose a new methodology with a statistical selection approach in order
to increase by a factor of $\sim 5$ the number of such events. Although the methodology can be applied
to address several selection problems, it has particular benefits in the case of the identification
of strongly lensed galaxies: objectivity, minimal initial constrains in the main parameter space,
preservation of the statistical properties. The proposed methodology is based on the Bhattacharyya
distance as a measure of the similarity between probability distributions of properties of two
different cross-matched galaxies. The particular implementation for the aim of this work is called
SHALOS and it combines the information of four different properties of the pair of galaxies: angular
separation, luminosity percentile, redshift and optical/sub-mm flux density ratio. The SHALOS
method provided a ranked list of strongly lensed galaxies. The number of candidates for the final
associated probability, $P_{tot}>0.7$, is 447 with an estimated mean amplification factor of
3.12 for an halo with a typical cluster mass. Additional statistical properties of the SHALOS candidates,
as the correlation function or the source number counts, are in agreement with previous results
indicating the statistical lensing nature of the selected sample.
