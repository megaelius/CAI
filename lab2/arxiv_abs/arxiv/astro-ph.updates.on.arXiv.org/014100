The true nature of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) remains largely unknown, and as survey statistics
increase, the question of astrophysical systematic uncertainties rises, notably that of the SN
Ia population evolution. In this paper, we study the dependence with redshift of the SN Ia SALT2.4
lightcurve stretch, a purely intrinsic SN property, to probe its potential redshift drift. The
SN stretch has been shown to strongly correlate with the SN environment, notably with stellar age
tracers. We model the underlying stretch distribution as a function of redshift, using the evolution
of fraction of young and old SNe Ia as predicted by Rigault et al. (2018), and assuming constant underlying
stretch distribution for each age population made of Gaussian mixtures. We test our prediction
against published samples chosen to have negligible magnitude selection effects, so that any observed
change is indeed of astrophysical and not observational origin. We clearly demonstrate that the
underlying SN Ia stretch distribution is evolving as a function of redshift, and that the young/old
drifting model is a much better description of the data than any time-constant model, including
the sample-based asymmetric distributions usually used to correct Malmquist bias. The favored
underlying stretch model is the bimodal one derived from Rigault et al. (2018): a high-stretch mode
shared by both young and old environments, and a low-stretch mode exclusive to old environments.
The precise impact of the redshift evolution of the SN Ia population intrinsic properties on cosmology
remains to be studied. Yet,the astrophysical drift of the SN stretch distribution does affect current
Malmquist bias corrections and thereby distances derived from SN affected by selection effects.
We highlight that such a bias will increase with surveys covering increasingly larger redshift
ranges, which is particularly important for LSST.
