The LIGO discoveries have rekindled suggestions that primordial black holes (BHs) may constitute
part to all of the dark matter (DM) in the Universe. Such suggestions came from 1) the observed merger
rate of the BHs, 2) their unusual masses, 3) their low/zero spins, and 4) also from the independently
uncovered cosmic infrared background (CIB) fluctuations signal of high amplitude and coherence
with unresolved cosmic X-ray background (CXB). Here we summarize the prospects to resolve this
important issue with electromagnetic observations using the instruments and tools expected in
the 2020's. These prospects appear promising to make significant, and potentially critical, advances.
We demonstrate that in the next decade, new space- and ground-borne electromagnetic instruments,
combined with concurrent theoretical efforts, should shed critical light on the long-considered
link between primordial BHs and DM. Specifically the new data and methodologies under this program
will involve: I) Probing with high precision the spatial spectrum of source-subtracted CIB with
Euclid and WFIRST, and its coherence with unresolved cosmic X-ray background using eROSITA and
Athena, II) Advanced searches for microlensing of Galactic stars by the intervening Galactic Halo
BHs with OGLE, Gaia, LSST and WFIRST, III) Supernovae (SNe) lensing in the upcoming surveys with
WFIRST, LSST and also potentially with Euclid and JWST, IV) Advanced theoretical work to understand
the details of PBH accretion and evolution and their influence on cosmic microwave background (CMB)
anisotropies in light of the next generation CMB experiments, V) Better new samples and theoretical
understanding involving stability and properties of ultra faint dwarf galaxies, pulsar timing,
and cosmological quasar lensing.
