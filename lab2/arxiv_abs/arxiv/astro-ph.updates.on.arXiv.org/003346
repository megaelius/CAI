Discs around young planets, so-called circumplanetary discs (CPDs), are essential for planet
growth, satellite formation, and planet detection. We study the millimetre and centimetre emission
from accreting CPDs by using the simple $\alpha$ disc model. We find that it is easier to detect CPDs
at shorter radio wavelengths (e.g. $\lambda\lesssim$ 1 mm). For example, if the system is 140 pc
away from us, deep observations (e.g. 5 hours) at ALMA Band 7 (0.87 mm) are sensitive to as small as
0.03 lunar mass of dust in CPDs. If the CPD is around a Jupiter mass planet 20 AU away from the host star
and has $\alpha\lesssim 0.001$, ALMA can detect this disc when it accretes faster than $10^{-10}
M_{\odot}/yr$. ALMA can also detect the "minimum mass sub-nebulae" disc if such a disc exists around
a young planet in YSOs. However, to distinguish the embedded compact CPD from the circumstellar
disc material, we should observe circumstellar discs with large gaps/cavities using the highest
resolution possible. We also calculate the CPD fluxes at VLA bands, and discuss the possibility
of detecting radio emission from jets/winds launched in CPDs. Finally we argue that, if the radial
drift of dust particles is considered, the drifting timescale for millimetre dust in CPDs can be
extremely short. It only takes 10$^2$-10$^{3}$ years for CPDs to lose millimetre dust. Thus, for
CPDs to be detectable at radio wavelengths, mm-sized dust in CPDs needs to be replenished continuously,
or the disc has a significant fraction of micron-sized dust or a high gas surface density so that the
particle drifting timescale is long, or the radial drift is prevented by other means (e.g. pressure
traps).
