The development of two-dimensional (2D) bulge-to-disk decomposition techniques has shown their
advantages over traditional one-dimensional (1D) techniques, especially for galaxies with non-axisymmetric
features. However, the full potential of 2D techniques has yet to be fully exploited. Secondary
morphological features in nearby disk galaxies, such as bars, lenses, rings, disk breaks, and spiral
arms, are seldom accounted for in 2D image decompositions, even though some image-fitting codes,
such as GALFIT, are capable of handling them. We present detailed, 2D multi-model and multi-component
decomposition of high-quality $R$-band images of a representative sample of nearby disk galaxies
selected from the Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey, using the latest version of GALFIT. The sample
consists of five barred and five unbarred galaxies, spanning Hubble types from S0 to Sc. Traditional
1D decomposition is also presented for comparison. In detailed case studies of the 10 galaxies,
we successfully model the secondary morphological features. Through a comparison of best-fit
parameters obtained from different input surface brightness models, we identify morphological
features that significantly impact bulge measurements. We show that nuclear and inner lenses/rings
and disk breaks must be properly taken into account to obtain accurate bulge parameters, whereas
outer lenses/rings and spiral arms have a negligible effect. We provide an optimal strategy to measure
bulge parameters of typical disk galaxies, as well as prescriptions to estimate realistic uncertainties
of them, which will benefit subsequent decomposition of a larger galaxy sample.
