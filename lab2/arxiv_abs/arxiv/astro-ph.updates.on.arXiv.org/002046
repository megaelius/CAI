We present cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) observations
obtained by the SDSS-II and SNLS collaborations. The data set includes several low-redshift samples
(z<0.1), all 3 seasons from the SDSS-II (0.05 < z < 0.4), and 3 years from SNLS (0.2 <z
< 1) and totals \ntotc spectroscopically confirmed type Ia supernovae with high quality light
curves. We have followed the methods and assumptions of the SNLS 3-year data analysis except for
the following important improvements: 1) the addition of the full SDSS-II spectroscopically-confirmed
SN Ia sample in both the training of the SALT2 light curve model and in the Hubble diagram analysis
(\nsdssc SNe), 2) inter-calibration of the SNLS and SDSS surveys and reduced systematic uncertainties
in the photometric calibration, performed blindly with respect to the cosmology analysis, and
3) a thorough investigation of systematic errors associated with the SALT2 modeling of SN Ia light-curves.
We produce recalibrated SN Ia light-curves and associated distances for the SDSS-II and SNLS samples.
The large SDSS-II sample provides an effective, independent, low-z anchor for the Hubble diagram
and reduces the systematic error from calibration systematics in the low-z SN sample. For a flat
LCDM cosmology we find Omega_m=0.295+-0.034 (stat+sys), a value consistent with the most recent
CMB measurement from the Planck and WMAP experiments. Our result is 1.8sigma (stat+sys) different
than the previously published result of SNLS 3-year data. The change is due primarily to improvements
in the SNLS photometric calibration. When combined with CMB constraints, we measure a constant
dark-energy equation of state parameter w=-1.018+-0.057 (stat+sys) for a flat universe. Adding
BAO distance measurements gives similar constraints: w=-1.027+-0.055.
