During their dynamical evolution, Galactic open clusters (OCs) gradually lose their stellar content
mainly because of internal relaxation and tidal forces. In this context, the study of dynamically
evolved OCs is necessary to properly understand such processes. We present a comprehensive Washington
$CT_1$ photometric analysis of six sparse OCs, namely: ESO 518-3, Ruprecht 121, ESO 134-12, NGC
6573, ESO 260-7 and ESO 065-7. We employed Markov chain Monte-Carlo simulations to robustly determine
the central coordinates and the structural parameters and $T_1\times(C-T_1)$ colour-magnitude
diagrams (CMDs) cleaned from field contamination were used to derive the fundamental parameters.
ESO 518-03, Ruprecht 121, ESO 134-12 and NGC 6573 resulted to be of nearly the same young age (8.2 $\leq\textrm{log}(t
\textrm{yr}^{-1})\leq$ 8.3); ESO 260-7 and ESO065-7 are of intermediate age (9.2 $\leq\textrm{log}(t
\textrm{yr}^{-1})\leq$ 9.4). All studied OCs are located at similar Galactocentric distances
(R$_{G}\sim6-6.9 $kpc), considering uncertainties, except for ESO 260-7 ($R_{G}=8.9 $kpc).
These OCs are in a tidally filled regime and are dynamically evolved, since they are much older than
their half-mass relaxation times ($t/t_{rh}\gtrsim30$) and present signals of low-mass star
depletion. We distinguished two groups: those dynamically evolving towards final disruptions
and those in an advanced dynamical evolutionary stage. Although we do not rule out that the Milky
Way potential could have made differentially faster their dynamical evolutions, we speculate
here with the possibility that they have been mainly driven by initial formation conditions.
