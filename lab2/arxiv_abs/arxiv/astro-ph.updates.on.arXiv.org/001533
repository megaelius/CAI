Our aim is to show how variable Doppler boosting of an intrinsically variable jet can explain the
long-term modulation of 1667 \pm 8 days observed in the radio emission of LSI+61303. The physical
scenario is that of a conical, magnetized plasma jet having a periodical (P1) increase of relativistic
particles, Nrel, at a specific orbital phase, as predicted by accretion in the eccentric orbit of
LSI+61303. Jet precession (P2) changes the angle, eta, between jet axis and line of sight, thereby
inducing variable Doppler boosting. The problem is defined in spherical geometry, and the optical
depth through the precessing jet is calculated by taking into account that the plasma is stratified
along the jet axis. The synchrotron emission of such a jet was calculated and we fitted the resulting
flux density Smodel(t) to the observed flux density obtained during a 6.5-year monitoring of LSI+61303
by the Green Bank radio interferometer. Our physical model for the system LSI+61303 is not only able
to reproduce the long-term modulation in the radio emission, but it also reproduces all the other
observed characteristics of the radio source, the orbital modulation of the outbursts, their orbital
phase shift, and their spectral index properties. Moreover, a correspondence seems to exist between
variations in the ejection angle induced by precession and the rapid rotation in position angle
observed in VLBA images. We conclude that the peak of the long-term modulation occurs when the jet
electron density is around its maximum and the approaching jet is forming the smallest possible
angle with the line of sight. This coincidence of maximum number of emitting particles and maximum
Doppler boosting of their emission occurs every 1667 days and creates the long-term modulation
observed in LSI+61303.
