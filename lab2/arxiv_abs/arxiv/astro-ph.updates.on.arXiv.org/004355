We present the study of the dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity and stellar mass in the
redshift range 2$<$z$<$3.5 using 3236 galaxies with robust spectroscopic redshifts from the VIMOS
Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS). We measure the two-point real-space correlation function $w_p(r_p)$
for four volume-limited stellar mass and four luminosity, M$_{UV}$ absolute magnitude selected,
sub-samples. We find that the scale dependent clustering amplitude $r_0$ significantly increases
with increasing luminosity and stellar mass indicating a strong galaxy clustering dependence
on these properties. This corresponds to a strong relative bias between these two sub-samples of
$\Delta$b/b$^*$=0.43. Fitting a 5-parameter HOD model we find that the most luminous and massive
galaxies occupy the most massive dark matter haloes with $\langle$M$_h$$\rangle$ = 10$^{12.30}$
h$^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$. Similar to the trends observed at lower redshift, the minimum halo mass M$_{min}$
depends on the luminosity and stellar mass of galaxies and grows from M$_{min}$ =10$^{9.73}$ h$^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$
to M$_{min}$=10$^{11.58}$ h$^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$ from the faintest to the brightest among our galaxy
sample, respectively. We find the difference between these halo masses to be much more pronounced
than is observed for local galaxies of similar properties. Moreover, at z~3, we observe that the
masses at which a halo hosts, on average, one satellite and one central galaxy is M$_1$$\approx$4M$_{min}$
over all luminosity ranges, significantly lower than observed at z~0 indicating that the halo satellite
occupation increases with redshift. The luminosity and stellar mass dependence is also reflected
in the measurements of the large scale galaxy bias, which we model as b$_{g,HOD}$($>$L)=1.92+25.36(L/L$^*$)$^{7.01}$.
We conclude our study with measurements of the stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR).
