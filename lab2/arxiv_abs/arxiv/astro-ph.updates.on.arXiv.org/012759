Supernovae (SNe) drive multiphase galactic outflows, impacting galaxy formation; however, cosmological
simulations mostly use \textit{ad hoc} feedback models for outflows, making outflow-related
predictions from first principles problematic. Recent small-box simulations resolve individual
SNe remnants in the interstellar medium (ISM), naturally driving outflows and permitting a determination
of the wind loading factors of energy $\eta_E$, mass $\eta_m$, and metals $\eta_Z$. In this Letter,
we compile small-box results, and find consensus that the hot outflows are much more powerful than
the cool outflows: (i) hot outflows generally dominate the energy flux, and (ii) their specific
energy $e_{s,h}$ is 10-1000 times higher than cool outflows. Moreover, the properties of hot outflows
are remarkably simple: $e_{s,h} \propto \eta_{E,h}/\eta_{m,h}$ is almost invariant over four
orders of magnitude of star formation surface density. Also, we find tentatively that $\eta_{E,h}/\eta_{Z,h}
\sim$ 0.5. If corroborated by more simulation data, these correlations reduce the three hot phase
loading factors into one. Finally, this one parameter is closely related to whether the ISM has a
"breakout" condition. The narrow range of \esh\ indicates that hot outflows cannot escape dark
matter halos with log $M_{\rm{halo}}\ [M_\odot] \gtrsim 12$. This mass is also where the galaxy
mass-metallicity relation reaches its plateau, implying a deep connection between \textit{hot}
outflows and galaxy formation. We argue that hot outflows should be included explicitly in cosmological
simulations and (semi-)analytic modeling of galaxy formation.
