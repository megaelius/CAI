We present ALMA observations of rest-frame far-infrared continuum and [CII] line emission in two
z=6.4 quasars with black hole masses of ~10^8 M_sun. CFHQS J0210-0456 is detected in the continuum
with a 1.2 mm flux of 120+/-35 microJy, whereas CFHQS J2329-0301 is undetected at a similar noise
level. J2329-0301 has a star formation rate limit of <40 M_sun/yr, considerably below the typical
value at all redshifts for this bolometric luminosity. By comparison with hydro simulations, we
speculate that this quasar is observed at a relatively rare phase where quasar feedback has effectively
shut down star formation in the host galaxy. [CII] emission is also detected only in J0210-0456.
The ratio of [CII] to far-infrared luminosity is similar to that of low redshift galaxies of comparable
luminosity, suggesting the previous finding of an offset in the relationships between this ratio
and far-infrared luminosity at low- and high-redshift may be partially due to a selection effect
from the limited sensitivity of previous observations. The [CII] line of J0210-0456 is relatively
narrow (FWHM=189+/-18 km/s), indicating a dynamical mass substantially lower than expected from
the local black hole - velocity dispersion correlation. The [CII] line is marginally resolved at
0.7" resolution with the blue and red wings spatially offset by 0.5" (3 kpc) and a smooth velocity
gradient of 100 km/s across a scale of 6 kpc, possibly due to rotation of a galaxy-wide disk. These
observations are consistent with the idea that stellar mass growth lags black hole accretion for
quasars at this epoch with respect to more recent times.
