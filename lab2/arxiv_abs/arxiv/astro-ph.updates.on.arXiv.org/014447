Most efforts to detect signatures of dynamical dark energy are focused on late times, $z \lesssim
2$, where the dark energy component begins to dominate the cosmic energy density. Many theoretical
models involving dynamical dark energy exhibit a 'freezing' equation of state however, where $w
\to -1$ at late times, with a transition to a 'tracking' behaviour at earlier times (with $w \gg -1$
at sufficiently high redshift). In this paper, we study whether large-scale structure surveys
in the post-reionisation matter-dominated regime, $2 \lesssim z \lesssim 6$, are sensitive to
this behaviour, on the basis that the dark energy component should remain detectable (despite being
strongly subdominant) in this redshift range given sufficiently precise observations. Using
phenomenological models inspired by parameter space studies of Horndeski (generalised scalar-tensor)
theories, we show how existing CMB and large-scale structure measurements constrain the dark energy
equation of state in the matter-dominated era, and examine how forthcoming galaxy surveys and 21cm
intensity mapping instruments can improve constraints in this regime. We also find that the combination
of existing CMB and LSS constraints with DESI will already come close to offering the best possible
constraints on $H_0$ using BAO/galaxy power spectrum measurements, and that either a spectroscopic
follow-up of the LSST galaxy sample (e.g. along the lines of MegaMapper or SpecTel) or a Stage 2/PUMA-like
intensity mapping survey, both at $z \gtrsim 2$, would offer better constraints on the class of dark
energy models considered here than a comparable cosmic variance-limited galaxy survey at $z \lesssim
1.5$.
