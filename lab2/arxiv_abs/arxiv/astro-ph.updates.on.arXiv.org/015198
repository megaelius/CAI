Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) which reside at the centres of galaxies can inject vast amounts
of energy into the surrounding gas and are thought to be a viable mechanism to quench star-formation
in massive galaxies. Here we study the $10^{9\textrm{--}12.5}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ stellar mass
central galaxy population of the IllustrisTNG simulation, specifically the TNG100 and TNG300
volumes at \zeq{0}, and show how the three components -- SMBH, galaxy, and circumgalactic medium
(CGM) -- are interconnected in their evolution. We find that gas entropy is a sensitive diagnostic
of feedback injection. In particular, we demonstrate how the onset of the low-accretion BH feedback
mode, realised in the IllustrisTNG model as a kinetic, BH-driven wind, leads not only to star-formation
quenching at stellar masses $\gtrsim10^{10.5}\mathrm{M_\odot}$ but also to a change in thermodynamic
properties of the (\emph{non}-star-forming) gas, both within the galaxy and beyond. The IllustrisTNG
kinetic feedback from SMBHs increases the average gas entropy, within the galaxy and in the CGM,
lengthening typical gas cooling times from $10\textrm{--}100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ to $1\textrm{--}10\,\mathrm{Gyr}$,
effectively ceasing ongoing star-formation and inhibiting radiative cooling and future gas accretion.
In practice, the same AGN feedback channel is simultaneously `ejective' and `preventative' and
leaves an imprint on the temperature, density, entropy, and cooling times also in the outer reaches
of the gas halo, up to distances of several hundred kiloparsecs. In the IllustrisTNG model, a long-lasting
quenching state can occur for a heterogeneous CGM, whereby the hot and dilute CGM gas of quiescent
galaxies contains regions of low-entropy gas with short cooling times.
