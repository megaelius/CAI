We present a combined optical and X-ray analysis of the rich cluster Abell 1882 with the aim of identifying
merging substructure and understanding the recent assembly history of this system. Our optical
data consist of spectra drawn from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, which lends itself
to this kind of detailed study thanks to its depth and high spectroscopic completeness. We use 283
spectroscopically confirmed cluster members to detect and characterize substructure. We complement
the optical data with X-ray data taken with both Chandra and XMM. Our analysis reveals that A1882
harbors two main components, A1882A and A1882B, which have a projected separation of 2Mpc and a line
of sight velocity difference of v_{los}=-428km/s. The primary system, A1882A, has velocity dispersion
sigma_v=500km/s and Chandra (XMM) temperature kT=3.57keV (3.31keV) while the secondary, A1882B,
has sigma_v=457km/s and Chandra (XMM) temperature kT=2.39keV (2.12keV). The optical and X-ray
estimates for the masses of the two systems are consistent within the uncertainties and indicate
that there is twice as much mass in A1882A (M_{500}=1.5-1.9x10^{14}Msolar) when compared with
A1882B (M_{500}=0.8-1.0x10^{14}Msolar). We interpret the A1882A/A1882B system as being observed
prior to a core passage. Supporting this interpretation is the large projected separation of A1882A
and A1882B and the dearth of evidence for a recent (<2Gyr) major interaction in the X-ray data.
Two-body analyses indicate that A1882A and A1882B form a bound system with bound incoming solutions
strongly favored. We compute blue fractions of f_b=0.28 and 0.18 for the spectroscopically confirmed
member galaxies within r_{500} of the centers of A1882A and A1882B, respectively. These blue fractions
do not differ significantly from the blue fraction measured from an ensemble of 20 clusters with
similar mass and redshift.
