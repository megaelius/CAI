The assessment of the frequency of planetary systems reproducing the Solar System's architecture
is still an open problem. Detailed study of multiplicity and architecture is generally hampered
by limitations in quality, temporal extension and observing strategy, causing difficulties in
detecting low-mass inner planets in the presence of outer giant planetary bodies. We present the
results of high-cadence and high-precision HARPS observations on 20 solar-type stars known to
host a single long-period giant planet in order to search for additional inner companions and estimate
the occurence rate $f_p$ of scaled Solar System analogs, i.e. systems featuring lower-mass inner
planets in the presence of long-period giant planets. We carry out combined fits of our HARPS data
with literature radial velocities using differential evolution MCMC to refine the literature
orbital solutions and search for additional inner planets. We then derive the survey detection
limits to provide preliminary estimates of $f_p$. We generally find better constrained orbital
parameters for the known planets than those found in the literature. While no additional inner planet
is detected, we find evidence for previously unreported long-period massive companions in systems
HD 50499 and HD 73267. We finally estimate the frequency of inner low mass (10-30 M$_\oplus$) planets
in the presence of outer giant planets as $f_p<9.84\%$ for P<150 days. Our preliminary estimate
of $f_p$ is significantly lower than the values found in the literature; the lack of inner candidate
planets found in our sample can also be seen as evidence corroborating the inward migration formation
model for super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. Our results also underline the need for high-cadence
and high-precision follow-up observations as the key to precisely determine the occurence of Solar
System analogs.
