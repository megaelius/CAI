Luminosity of GRB 170817A is much lower than that of other sGRBs. The measurement of the superluminal
movement of the radio afterglow emission confirms the presence of the relativistic jet, and the
emission features can be well explained by the structured jet model. In this paper, we calculate
the luminosity distribution of sGRBs and its evolution with redshift based on the structured (Gaussian)
jet model, and find that the typical luminosity increase with redshift, for nearby sGRBs (such as
for luminosity distance less than 200 Mpc) the typical gamma-ray luminosity is just around 10^47-10^48
erg s-1, which naturally explains the very low radiation luminosity of GRB 170817A. We derived the
detection probability of sGRBs by Fermi-GBM and found that the expected detection rate of sGRBs
is only about 1 yr-1 within the distance of several hundred Mpc. We explored the effect of the power-law
index {\alpha} of the merger time distribution on the observed characteristics and found that it
had little effect on the observed luminosity and viewing-angle distributions. However, it is very
interesting that, for different values of {\alpha}, the distributions of the number of observed
sGRBs are quite different, so it is possible to determine the value of {\alpha} through observed
distributions of the number of sGRBs. We used the Bayesian method to make a quantitative analysis
and found that the value of {\alpha} may be identified when the number of observed sGRBs with known
redshifts is more than 200. Finally, we compare our results of gamma-ray luminosity distribution
with sGRBs with known redshifts, and found that our results are consistent with the observation,
which implies that our simulation results can reproduce the observed luminosity distribution
well.
