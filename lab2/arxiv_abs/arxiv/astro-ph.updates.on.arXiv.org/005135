Wolf-Rayet star's winds can be so dense and so optically thick that the photosphere appears in the
highly supersonic part of the outflow, veiling the underlying subsonic part of the star, and leaving
the initial acceleration of the wind inaccessible to observations. We investigate the conditions
and the structure of the subsonic part of the outflow of Galactic WR stars, in particular of the WNE
subclass; our focus is on the conditions at the sonic point. We compute 1D hydrodynamic stellar structure
models for massive helium stars adopting outer boundaries at the sonic point. We find that the outflows
of our models are accelerated to supersonic velocities by the radiative force from opacity bumps
either at temperatures of the order of 200kK by the Fe opacity bump or of the order of 50kK by the HeII
opacity bump. For a given mass-loss rate, the conditions in the subsonic part of the outflow are independent
from the detailed physical conditions in the supersonic part. The close proximity to the Eddington
limit at the sonic point allows us to construct a Sonic HR diagram, relating the sonic point temperature
to the L/M ratio and the stellar mass-loss rate, thereby constraining the sonic point conditions,
the subsonic structure, and the stellar wind mass-loss rates from observations. The minimum mass-loss
rate necessary to have the flow accelerated to supersonic velocities by the Fe opacity bump is derived.
A comparison of the observed parameters of Galactic WNE stars to this minimum mass-loss rate indicates
that their winds are launched to supersonic velocities by the radiation pressure arising from the
Fe-bump. Conversely, models which do not show transonic flows from the Fe opacity bump form inflated
envelopes. We derive an analytic criterion for the appearance of envelope inflation in the subphotospheric
layers.
