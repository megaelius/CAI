Methanol is a key species in astrochemistry since it is the most abundant organic molecule in the
ISM and is thought to be the mother molecule of many complex organic species. Estimating the deuteration
of methanol around young protostars is of crucial importance because it highly depends on its formation
mechanisms and the physical conditions during its moment of formation. We analyse dozens of transitions
from deuterated methanol isotopologues coming from various existing observational datasets
from the IRAM-PdBI and ALMA sub-mm interferometers to estimate the methanol deuteration surrounding
three low-mass protostars on Solar System scales. A population diagram analysis allows us to derive
a [CH$_2$DOH]/[CH$_3$OH] abundance ratio of 3-6 % and a [CH$_3$OD]/[CH$_3$OH] ratio of 0.4-1.6
% in the warm inner protostellar regions. These values are ten times lower than those derived with
previous single-dish observations towards these sources but they are 10-100 times higher than
the methanol deuteration measured in massive hot cores. Dust temperature maps obtained from Herschel
and Planck observations show that massive hot cores are located in warmer molecular clouds than
low-mass sources, with temperature differences of $\sim$10 K. Comparison with the predictions
of the gas-grain astrochemical model GRAINOBLE shows that such a temperature difference is sufficient
to explain the different deuteration observed in low- to high-mass sources, suggesting that the
physical conditions of the molecular cloud at the origin of the protostars mostly govern the present
observed deuteration of methanol. The methanol deuteration measured in this work is higher by a
factor of 5 than the upper limit in methanol deuteration estimated in comet Hale-Bopp, implying
that an important reprocessing of the organic material would have occurred in the solar nebula during
the formation of the Solar System.
