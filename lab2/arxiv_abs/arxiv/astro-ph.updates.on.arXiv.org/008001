The galactic halo likely grew over time in part by assembling smaller galaxies, the so-called building
blocks. We investigate if the properties of these building blocks are reflected in the halo white
dwarf (WD) population in the Solar neighborhood. Furthermore, we compute the halo WD luminosity
functions (WDLFs) for four major building blocks of five cosmologically motivated stellar haloes.
We couple the SeBa binary population synthesis model to the Munich-Groningen semi-analytic galaxy
formation model, applied to the high-resolution Aquarius dark matter simulations. Although the
semi-analytic model assumes an instantaneous recycling approximation, we model the evolution
of zero-age main sequence stars to WDs, taking age and metallicity variations of the population
into account. Although the majority of halo stars is old and metal-poor and therefore the WDs in the
different building blocks have similar properties (including present-day luminosity), we find
in our models that the WDs originating from building blocks that have young and/or metal-rich stars
can be distinguished from WDs that were born in other building blocks. In practice however, it will
be hard to prove that these WDs really originate from different building blocks, as the variations
in the halo WD population due to binary WD mergers result in similar effects. The five joined stellar
halo WD populations that we modelled result in WDLFs that are very similar to each other. We find that
simple models with a Kroupa or Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) fit the observed luminosity
function slightly better, since the Chabrier IMF is more top-heavy, although this result is dependent
on our choice of the stellar halo mass density in the Solar neighborhood.
