We analyse new SCUBA-2 submillimeter and archival SPIRE far-infrared imaging of a z=1.62 cluster,
Cl0218.3-0510, which lies in the UKIDSS/UDS field of the SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey. Combining
these tracers of obscured star formation activity with the extensive photometric and spectroscopic
information available for this field, we identify 31 far-infrared/submillimeter-detected probable
cluster members with bolometric luminosities >1e12 Lo and show that by virtue of their dust content
and activity, these represent some of the reddest and brightest galaxies in this structure. We exploit
Cycle-1 ALMA submillimeter continuum imaging which covers one of these sources to confirm the identification
of a SCUBA-2-detected ultraluminous star-forming galaxy in this structure. Integrating the total
star-formation activity in the central region of the structure, we estimate that it is an order of
magnitude higher (in a mass-normalised sense) than clusters at z~0.5-1. However, we also find that
the most active cluster members do not reside in the densest regions of the structure, which instead
host a population of passive and massive, red galaxies. We suggest that while the passive and active
populations have comparable near-infrared luminosities at z=1.6, M(H)~-23, the subsequent stronger
fading of the more active galaxies means that they will evolve into passive systems at the present-day
which are less luminous than the descendants of those galaxies which were already passive at z~1.6
(M(H)~-20.5 and M(H)~-21.5 respectively at z~0). We conclude that the massive galaxy population
in the dense cores of present-day clusters were already in place at z=1.6 and that in Cl0218.3-0510
we are seeing continuing infall of less extreme, but still ultraluminous, star-forming galaxies
onto a pre-existing structure.
