We examine the thermodynamic state and cooling of the low-$z$ Circum-Galactic Medium (CGM) in five
FIRE-2 galaxy formation simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies. We find that the CGM in these simulations
is generally multiphase and dynamic, with a wide spectrum of largely nonlinear density perturbations
sourced by the accretion of gas from the IGM and winds from both the central and satellite galaxies.
We investigate the origin of the multiphase structure of the CGM with a particle tracking analysis
and find that most of the low entropy gas has cooled from the hot halo as a result of thermal instability
triggered by these perturbations. The ratio of cooling to free-fall timescales $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm
ff}$ in the hot component of the CGM spans a wide range $\sim 1-100$ at a given radius, but exhibits
approximately constant median values $\sim 5-20$ at all radii $0.1 R_{\rm vir} < r < R_{\rm vir}$.
These are similar to the $\approx 10-20$ value typically adopted as the thermal instability threshold
in "precipitation" models of the ICM. Consequently, a one-dimensional model based on the assumption
of a constant $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$ and hydrostatic equilibrium approximately reproduces
the simulation number density and entropy profiles, but only if it assumes the metallicity profiles
taken directly from the simulations. We explicitly show that the $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$ value
of a gas parcel in the hot component of the CGM does not predict its probability of cooling and subsequently
accreting onto the central galaxy. This suggests that the value of $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$ is
a poor predictor of thermal stability in gaseous halos in which large-amplitude density perturbations
are prevalent.
