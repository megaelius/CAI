This study aims at investigating the ability of strong interactions between magnetic field concentrations
during their rise through the convection zone to produce complex active regions at the solar surface.
To do so, we perform numerical simulations of buoyant magnetic structures evolving and interacting
in a model solar convection zone. We first produce a 3D model of rotating convection and then introduce
idealized magnetic structures close to the bottom of the computational domain. These structures
possess a certain degree of field line twist and they are made buoyant on a particular extension in
longitude. The resulting twisted $\Omega$-loops will thus evolve inside a spherical convective
shell possessing large-scale mean flows. We present results on the interaction between two such
loops with various initial parameters (mainly buoyancy and twist) and on the complexity of the emerging
magnetic field. In agreement with analytical predictions, we find that if the loops are introduced
with opposite handedness and same axial field direction or same handedness but opposite axial field,
they bounce against each other. The emerging region is then constituted of two separated bipolar
structures. On the contrary, if the loops are introduced with the same direction of axial and peripheral
magnetic fields and if sufficiently close, they merge while rising. This more interesting case
produces complex magnetic structures, with a high degree of non-neutralized currents, especially
when the convective motions act significantly on the magnetic field. This indicates that those
interactions could be good candidates to produce eruptive events like flares or CMEs.
