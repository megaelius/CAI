The formation of shocks within the solar atmosphere remains one of the few observable signatures
of energy dissipation arising from the plethora of magnetohydrodynamic waves generated close
to the solar surface. Active region observations offer exceptional views of wave behavior and its
impact on the surrounding atmosphere. The stratified plasma gradients present in the lower solar
atmosphere allow for the potential formation of many theorized shock phenomena. In this study,
using chromospheric Ca II 854.2nm spectropolarimetric data of a large sunspot, we examine fluctuations
in the plasma parameters in the aftermath of powerful shock events that demonstrate polarimetric
reversals during their evolution. Modern inversion techniques are employed to uncover perturbations
in the temperatures, line-of-sight velocities, and vector magnetic fields occurring across a
range of optical depths synonymous with the shock formation. Classification of these non-linear
signatures is carried out by comparing the observationally-derived slow, fast, and Alfv\'en shock
solutions to the theoretical Rankine-Hugoniot relations. Employing over 200,000 independent
measurements, we reveal that the Alfv\'en (intermediate) shock solution provides the closest
match between theory and observations at optical depths of log(tau) = -4, consistent with a geometric
height at the boundary between the upper photosphere and lower chromosphere. This work uncovers
first-time evidence of the manifestation of chromospheric intermediate shocks in sunspot umbrae,
providing a new method for the potential thermalization of wave energy in a range of magnetic structures,
including pores, magnetic flux ropes, and magnetic bright points.
