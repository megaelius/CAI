The galaxy M 87 harbors a kiloparsec-scale relativistic jet, whose origin coincides with a supermassive
black hole. Observational mm-VLBI campaigns are capable of resolving the jet-launching region
at the scale of the event horizon. In order to provide a context for interpreting these observations,
realistic general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (GRMHD) models of the accretion flow
are constructed. The characteristics of the observed spectral-energy distribution (SED) depend
on the shape of the electrons' energy-distribution function (eDF). The dependency on the eDF is
omitted in the modeling of the first Event Horizon Telescope results. In this work, we aim to model
the M 87 SED from radio up to NIR/optical frequencies using a thermal-relativistic Maxwell- J\"uttner
distribution, as well as a relativistic $\kappa$-distribution function. The electrons are injected
based on sub-grid, particle-in-cell parametrizations for sub-relativistic reconnection. A
GRMHD simulation in Cartesian-Kerr-Schild coordinates, using eight levels of adaptive mesh refinement
(AMR), forms the basis of our model. To obtain spectra and images, the GRMHD data is post-processed
with the ray-tracing code RAPTOR, which is capable of ray tracing through AMR GRMHD simulation data.
We obtain radio spectra in both the thermal-jet and $\kappa$-jet models consistent with radio observations.
Additionally, the $\kappa$-jet models also recover the NIR/optical emission. The models recover
the observed source sizes and core shifts and obtain a jet power of $\approx 10^{43}$ ergs/s. In the
$\kappa$-jet models, both the accretion rates and jet powers are approximately two times lower
than the thermal-jet model. The frequency cut-off observed at $\nu \approx 10^{15}$ Hz is recovered
when the accelerator size is $10^6$ - $10^8$ cm, this could potentially point to an upper limit for
plasmoid sizes in the jet of M 87.
