The anisotrpy of the redshift space bispectrum $B^s(\mathbf{k_1},\mathbf{k_2},\mathbf{k_3})$,
which contains a wealth of cosmological information, is completely quantified using multipole
moments $\bar{B}^m_{\ell}(k_1,\mu,t)$ where $k_1$, the length of the largest side, and $(\mu,t)$
respectively quantify the size and shape of the triangle $(\mathbf{k_1},\mathbf{k_2},\mathbf{k_3})$.
We present analytical expressions for all the multipoles which are predicted to be non-zero ($\ell
\le 8, m \le 6$ ) at second order perturbation theory. The multipoles also depend on $\beta_1,b_1$
and $\gamma_2$, which quantify the linear redshift distortion parameter, linear bias and quadratic
bias respectively. Considering triangles of all possible shapes, we analyse the shape dependence
of all of the multipoles holding $k_1=0.2 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}, \beta_1=1, b_1=1$ and $\gamma_2=0$
fixed. The monopole $\bar{B}^0_0$, which is positive everywhere, is minimum for equilateral triangles.
$\bar{B}_0^0$ increases towards linear triangles, and is maximum for linear triangles close to
the squeezed limit. Both $\bar{B}^0_{2}$ and $\bar{B}^0_4$ are similar to $\bar{B}^0_0$, however
the quadrupole $\bar{B}^0_2$ exceeds $\bar{B}^0_0$ over a significant range of shapes. The other
multipoles, many of which become negative, have magnitudes smaller than $\bar{B}^0_0$. In most
cases the maxima or minima, or both, occur very close to the squeezed limit. $\mid \bar{B}^m_{\ell}
\mid $ is found to decrease rapidly if $\ell$ or $m$ are increased. The shape dependence shown here
is characteristic of non-linear gravitational clustering. Non-linear bias, if present, will
lead to a different shape dependence.
