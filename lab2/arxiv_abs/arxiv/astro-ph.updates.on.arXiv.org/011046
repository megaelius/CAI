(Abridged) ASHES has been designed to systematically characterize the earliest stages and to constrain
theories of high-mass star formation. A total of 12 massive (>500 $M_{\odot}$), cold (<15 K), 3.6-70
$\mu$m dark prestellar clump candidates, embedded in IRDCs, were carefully selected in the pilot
survey to be observed with ALMA. We mosaiced each clump (~1 arcmin^2) in dust and line emission with
the 12m/7m/TP arrays at 224 GHz, resulting in ~1.2" resolution (~4800 AU). As the first paper of the
series, we concentrate on the dust emission to reveal the clump fragmentation. We detect 294 cores,
from which 84 (29%) are categorized as protostellar based on outflow activity or 'warm core' line
emission. The remaining 210 (71%) are considered prestellar core candidates. The number of detected
cores is independent of the mass sensitivity range of the observations. On average, more massive
clumps tend to form more cores. We find a large population of low-mass (<1 M) cores and no high-mass
(>30 $M_{\odot}$) prestellar cores. The most massive prestellar core has a mass of 11 $M_{\odot}$.
From the prestellar CMF, we derive a power law index of 1.17+-0.1, slightly shallower than Salpeter
(1.35). We use the MST technique to characterize the separation between cores and their spatial
distribution, and derive mass segregation ratios. While there is a range of core masses and separations
detected in the sample, the mean separation and mass of cores are well explained by thermal fragmentation
and are inconsistent with turbulent Jeans fragmentation. The core spatial distribution is well
described by hierarchical subclustering rather than centrally peaked clustering. There is no
conclusive evidence of mass segregation. We test several theoretical conditions, and conclude
that overall, competitive accretion and global hierarchical collapse scenarios are favored over
the turbulent core accretion scenario.
