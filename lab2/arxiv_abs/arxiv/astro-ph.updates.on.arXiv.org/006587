The paper analyzes the structure and dynamics of a quiescent prominence that occurred on October
22, 2013. We aim to determine the physical characteristics of the observed prominence using MgII
k and h, CII (1334 and 1336 A), and SiIV (1394 A) lines observed by IRIS. We employed the 1D non-LTE modeling
of MgII lines assuming static isothermal-isobaric slabs. We selected a large grid of models with
realistic input parameters and computed synthetic MgII lines. The method of Scargle periodograms
was used to detect possible prominence oscillations. We analyzed 2160 points of the observed prominence
in five different sections along the slit averaged over ten pixels due to low signal to noise ratio
in the CII and SiIV lines. We computed the integrated intensity for all studied lines, while the central
intensity and reversal ratio was determined only for both MgII and CII 1334 lines. We plotted several
correlations: time evolution of the integrated intensities and central intensities, scatter
plots between all combinations of line integrated intensities, and reversal ratio as a function
of integrated intensity. We also compared MgII observations with the models. Results show that
more than two-thirds of MgII profiles and about one-half of CII 1334 profiles are reversed. Profiles
of SiIV are generally unreversed. The MgII and CII lines are optically thick, while the SiIV line
is optically thin. The studied prominence shows no global oscillations in the MgII and CII lines.
Therefore, the observed time variations are caused by random motions of fine structures with velocities
up to 10 km/s. The observed average ratio of MgII k to MgII h line intensities can be used to determine
the prominence's characteristic temperature. Certain disagreements between observed and synthetic
line intensities of MgII lines point to the necessity of using more complex 2D multi-thread modeling
in the future.
