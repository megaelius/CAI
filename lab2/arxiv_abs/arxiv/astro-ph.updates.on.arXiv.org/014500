Due to differing gravitational potentials and path lengths, gravitational lensing induces time
delays between multiple images of a source which, for solar mass objects, is of order $\sim10^{-5}$
seconds. If an astrophysically compact source, such as a Fast Radio Burst (FRB), is observed through
a region with a high optical depth of such microlensing masses, this gravitational lensing time
delay can be imprinted on short timescale transient signals. In this paper, we consider the impact
of the parity of the macroimage on the resultant microlensing time delays. It is found that this parity
is directly imprinted on the microlensing signal, with macroimages formed at minima of the time
arrival surface beginning with the most highly magnified microimages and then progressing to the
fainter microimages. At macroimages at the maxima of the time arrival surface, this situation is
reversed, with fainter images observed first and finishing with the brightest microimages. For
macroimages at saddle-points, the signal again begins with fainter images, followed by brighter
images before again fading through the fainter microimages. The growing populations of cosmologically
distant bursty transient sources will undoubtedly result in the discovery of strong lensed, multiply
imaged FRBs, which will be susceptible to microlensing by compact masses. With the temporal resolution
being offered my modern and future facilities, the detection of microlensing induced time delays
will reveal the parities of the gravitational lens macroimages, providing additional constraints
on macrolensing mass models and improving the efficacy of these transient sources as a cosmological
probes.
