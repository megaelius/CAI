The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is an electronically steered low frequency ($<300$\,MHz)
radio interferometer, with a `slew' time less than 8seconds. Low frequency ($\sim 100$\,MHz) radio
telescopes are ideally suited for rapid-response follow-up of transients due to their large field
of view, the inverted spectrum of coherent emission, and the fact that the dispersion delay between
a 1GHz and 100MHz pulse is on the order of $1-10$\,min for dispersion measures of $100-2000$\,pc/cm$^3$.
The MWA has previously been used to provide fast follow up for transient events including gamma-ray
bursts, fast radio bursts, and gravitational waves, using systems that respond to gamma-ray coordinates
network (GCN) packet-based notifications. We describe a system for automatically triggering
MWA observations of such events, based on VOEvent triggers, which is more flexible, capable, and
accurate than previous systems. The system can respond to external multi-messenger triggers,
which makes it well-suited to searching for prompt coherent radio emission from gamma-ray bursts,
the study of fast radio bursts and gravitational waves, single pulse studies of pulsars, and rapid
follow-up of high-energy superflares from flare stars. The new triggering system has the capability
to trigger observations in both the regular correlator mode (limited to $\geq 0.5$\,s integrations)
or using the Voltage Capture System (VCS, $0.1$\,ms integration) of the MWA, and represents a new
mode of operation for the MWA. The upgraded standard correlator triggering capability has been
in use since MWA observing semester 2018B (July-Dec 2018), and the VCS and buffered mode triggers
will become available for observing in a future semester.
