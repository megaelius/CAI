Liquid water oceans are at the center of our search for life on exoplanets because water is a strict
requirement for life as we know it. However, oceans are dynamic habitats---and some oceans may be
better hosts for life than others. In Earth's ocean, circulation transports essential nutrients
such as phosphate and is a first-order control on the distribution and productivity of life. Of particular
importance is upward flow from the dark depths of the ocean in response to wind-driven divergence
in surface layers. This `upwelling' returns essential nutrients that tend to accumulate at depth
via sinking of organic particulates back to the sunlit regions where photosynthetic life thrives.
Ocean dynamics are likely to impose constraints on the activity and atmospheric expression of photosynthetic
life in exo-oceans as well, but we lack an understanding of how ocean dynamics may differ on other
planets. We address this issue by exploring the sensitivity of ocean dynamics to a suite of planetary
parameters using ROCKE-3D, a fully coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM. Our results suggest that planets
that rotate slower and have higher surface pressure than Earth may be the most attractive targets
for remote life detection because upwelling is enhanced under these conditions, resulting in greater
nutrient supply to the surface biosphere. Seasonal deepening of the mixed layer on high obliquity
planets may also enhance nutrient replenishment from depth into the surface mixed layer. Efficient
nutrient recycling favors greater biological activity, more biosignature production, and thus
more detectable life. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of considering oceanographic
phenomena for exoplanet life detection and motivate future interdisciplinary contributions
to the emerging field of exo-oceanography.
