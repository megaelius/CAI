We explore the possibility that Dark Matter (DM) may be explained by a non-uniform background of
approximately stellar-mass clusters of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs), by simulating the evolution
them from recombination to the present with over 5000 realisations using a Newtonian $ N $-body code.
We compute the cluster rate of evaporation, and extract the binary and merged sub-populations along
with their parent and merger tree histories, lifetimes and formation rates; the dynamical and orbital
parameter profiles, the degree of mass segregation and dynamical friction, and power spectrum
of close encounters. Overall, we find that PBHs can constitute a viable DM candidate, and that their
clustering presents a rich phenomenology throughout the history of the Universe. We show that binary
systems constitute about 9.5% of all PBHs at present, with mass ratios of $ \bar{q}_{\mathrm{B}}
= 0.154 $, and total masses of $ \bar{m}_{\mathrm{T},\mathrm{B}} = 303 \mathrm{M_\odot}$. Merged
PBHs are rare, about 0.0023% of all PBHs at present, with mass ratios of $ \bar{q}_{\mathrm{M}} =
0.965 $ with total and chirp masses of $ \bar{m}_{\mathrm{T},\mathrm{M}} = 1670 \mathrm{M_\odot}
$ and $ \bar{m}_{c,\mathrm{M}} = 642 \mathrm{M_\odot} $ respectively. We find that cluster puffing
up and evaporation leads to bubbles of these PBHs of order 1 kpc containing at present times about
36% of objects and mass, with hundred pc sized cores. We also find that these PBH sub-haloes are distributed
in wider PBH haloes of order hundreds of kpc, containing about 63% of objects and mass, coinciding
with the sizes of galactic halos. We find at last high rates of close encounters of massive Black Holes
($ M \sim 1000 \mathrm{M_\odot} $), with $ \Gamma^{\mathrm{S}} = (1.2 \substack {+5.9 \\ -0.9})
\times 10^{7} \mathrm{yr^{-1} Gpc^{-3}}$ and mergers with $\Gamma^{\mathrm{M}} = 1337 \pm 41
\mathrm{yr^{-1} Gpc^{-3}} $.
