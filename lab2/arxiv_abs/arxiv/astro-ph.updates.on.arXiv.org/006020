In previous papers, we introduced our method for measuring chemical abundances from integrated-light
spectra of globular clusters and applied it to a variety of extragalactic star clusters. Here we
extend our analysis technique to the infrared. We simultaneously analyse an optical spectrum of
the massive globular cluster G280 in M31, obtained with the HIRES spectrograph on the Keck I telescope,
and an H-band spectrum obtained with NIRSPEC on Keck II. We discuss the sensitivity of our results
to various modifications of the input assumptions, such as different line lists and isochrones
and the possible presence of a metallicity spread in G280. When using the most recent version of the
Kurucz line list, we measure iron abundances of [Fe/H]=-0.68+/-0.02 from the optical spectrum
and [Fe/H]=-0.60+/-0.07 from the infrared spectrum. These values agree well with previous spectroscopic
determinations of the metallicity of G280. While the small difference between the optical and infrared
measurements is insignificant given the uncertainties, it is also consistent with a metallicity
spread similar to that observed in massive GCs such as Omega Cen and G1, and also hinted at by the colour-magnitude
diagram of G280. The optical and infrared spectra both indicate an alpha-enhancement of about 0.3-0.4
dex relative to solar-scaled abundances, as typically also observed in Milky Way GCs. It appears
that our integrated-light analysis technique also performs well in the H-band. However, complications
due to the presence of molecular bands and telluric contamination are more severe in the infrared,
and accurate modelling of the coolest giants is more critical.
