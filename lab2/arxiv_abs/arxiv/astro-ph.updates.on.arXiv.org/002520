Dust properties are very likely affected by the environment in which dust grains evolve. For instance,
some analyses of cold clumps (7 K- 17 K) indicate that the aggregation process is favored in dense
environments. However, studying warm (30 K-40 K) dust emission at long wavelength ($\lambda$$>$300
$\mu$m) has been limited because it is difficult to combine far infared-to-millimeter (FIR-to-mm)
spectral coverage and high angular resolution for observations of warm dust grains. Using Herschel
data from 70 to 500 $\mu$m, which are part of the Herschel infrared Galactic (Hi-GAL) survey combined
with 1.1 mm data from the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS), we compared emission in two types
of environments: ultra-compact HII (UCHII) regions, and cold molecular clumps (denoted as cold
clumps). With this comparison we tested dust emission models in the FIR-to-mm domain that reproduce
emission in the diffuse medium, in these two environments (UCHII regions and cold clumps). We also
investigated their ability to predict the dust emission in our Galaxy. We determined the emission
spectra in twelve UCHII regions and twelve cold clumps, and derived the dust temperature (T) using
the recent two-level system (TLS) model with three sets of parameters and the so-called T-$\beta$
(temperature-dust emissvity index) phenomenological models, with $\beta$ set to 1.5, 2 and 2.5.
We tested the applicability of the TLS model in warm regions for the first time. This analysis indicates
distinct trends in the dust emission between cold and warm environments that are visible through
changes in the dust emissivity index. However, with the use of standard parameters, the TLS model
is able to reproduce the spectral behavior observed in cold and warm regions, from the change of the
dust temperature alone, whereas a T-$\beta$ model requires $\beta$ to be known.
