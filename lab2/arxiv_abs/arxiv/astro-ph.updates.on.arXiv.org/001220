Identifying galaxy clustering at high redshift (i.e. z > 1) is essential to our understanding
of the current cosmological model. However, at increasing redshift, clusters evolve considerably
in star-formation activity and so are less likely to be identified using the widely-used red sequence
method. Here we assess the viability of instead identifying high redshift clustering using actively
star-forming galaxies (SMGs associated with over-densities of BzKs/LBGs). We perform both a 2-
and 3-D clustering analysis to determine whether or not true (3D) clustering can be identified where
only 2D data are available. As expected, we find that 2D clustering signals are weak at best and inferred
results are method dependant. In our 3D analysis, we identify 12 SMGs associated with an over-density
of galaxies coincident both spatially and in redshift - just 8% of SMGs with known redshifts in our
sample. Where an SMG in our target fields lacks a known redshift, their sightline is no more likely
to display clustering than blank sky fields; prior redshift information for the SMG is required
to identify a true clustering signal. We find that the strength of clustering in the volume around
typical SMGs, while identifiable, is not exceptional. However, we identify a small number of highly
clustered regions, all associated with an SMG. The most notable of these, surrounding LESSJ033336.8-274401,
potentially contains an SMG, a QSO and 36 star-forming galaxies (a > 20sig over-density) all
at z~1.8. This region is highly likely to represent an actively star-forming cluster and illustrates
the success of using star-forming galaxies to select sites of early clustering. Given the increasing
number of deep fields with large volumes of spectroscopy, or high quality and reliable photometric
redshifts, this opens a new avenue for cluster identification in the young Universe.
