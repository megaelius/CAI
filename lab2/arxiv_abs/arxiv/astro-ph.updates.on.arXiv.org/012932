The OTELO survey is a very deep, blind exploration of a selected region of the Extended Groth Strip
and is designed for finding emission-line sources (ELSs). The survey design, observations, data
reduction, astrometry, and photometry, as well as the correlation with ancillary data used to obtain
a final catalogue, including photo-z estimates and a preliminary selection of ELS, were described
in a previous contribution. Here, we aim to determine the main properties and luminosity function
(LF) of the [O III] ELS sample of OTELO as a scientific demonstration of its capabilities, advantages,
and complementarity with respect to other surveys. The selection and analysis procedures of ELS
candidates obtained using tunable filter (TF) pseudo-spectra are described. We performed simulations
in the parameter space of the survey to obtain emission-line detection probabilities. Relevant
characteristics of [O III] emitters and the LF([O III]), including the main selection biases and
uncertainties, are presented. A total of 184 sources were confirmed as [O III] emitters at a mean
redshift z=0.83. The minimum detectable line flux and equivalent width (EW) in this ELS sample are
$\sim$5 $\times$ 10$^{-19}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{2}$ and $\sim$6 \AA, respectively. We are able to
constrain the faint-end slope ($\alpha = -1.03\pm0.08$) of the observed LF([O III]) at z=0.83.
This LF reaches values that are approximately ten times lower than those from other surveys. The
vast majority (84\%) of the morphologically classified [O III] ELSs are disc-like sources, and
87\% of this sample is comprised of galaxies with stellar masses of M$_\star$ $<$ 10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$.
