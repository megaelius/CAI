Stellar post asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) evolution can be completely altered by a final
thermal pulse (FTP) which may occur when the star is still leaving the AGB (AFTP), at the departure
from the AGB at still constant luminosity (late TP, LTP) or after the entry to the white-dwarf cooling
sequence (very late TP, VLTP). Then convection mixes the He-rich material with the H-rich envelope.
According to stellar evolution models the result is a star with a surface composition of $\mathrm{H}\approx\,20\,$%
by mass (AFTP), $\approx 1\,$% (LTP), or (almost) no H (VLTP). Since FTP stars exhibit intershell
material at their surface, spectral analyses establish constraints for AGB nucleosynthesis and
stellar evolution. We performed a spectral analysis of the so-called hybrid PG 1159-type central
stars (CS) of the planetary nebulae Abell 43 and NGC7094 by means of non-local thermodynamical equilibrium
models. We confirm the previously determined effective temperatures of $T_\mathrm{eff} = 115\,000\pm
5\,000\,$K and determine surface gravities of $\log (g\,/\,\mathrm{cm/s^2}) = 5.6\pm 0.1$ for
both. From a comparison with AFTP evolutionary tracks, we derive stellar masses of $0.57^{+0.07}_{-0.04}\,M_\odot$
and determine the abundances of H, He, and metals up to Xe. Both CS are likely AFTP stars with a surface
H mass fraction of $0.25 \pm 0.03$ and $0.15 \pm 0.03$, respectively, and a Fe deficiency indicating
subsolar initial metallicities. The light metals show typical PG 1159-type abundances and the
elemental composition is in good agreement with predictions from AFTP evolutionary models. However,
the expansion ages do not agree with evolution timescales expected from the AFTP scenario and alternatives
should be explored.
