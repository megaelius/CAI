Extremely metal-poor star-forming galaxies (XMPs) represent one of our only laboratories for
study of the low-metallicity stars we expect to encounter at early epochs. But as our understanding
of the $z>6$ universe has improved, it has become clear that the majority of known XMPs within 100
Mpc host significantly less prominent massive star populations than their reionization-era counterparts,
severely limiting their utility as testbeds for interpreting spectral features found at the highest
redshifts. Here we present a new photometric selection technique designed to identify nearby XMPs
dominated by young stellar populations comparable to those expected in the reionization era. We
apply our technique to uncover candidate XMPs in SDSS imaging at magnitudes $16<i<23$, extending
significantly below the completeness limits of the SDSS spectroscopic survey. Spectroscopic
observations with the MMT confirm that 32 of the 53 uniformly metal-poor and vigorously star-forming
targets we observed present gas-phase oxygen abundances $12+\log\mathrm{O/H}<7.7$ ($Z/Z_\odot<0.1$),
including two in the range of the lowest-metallicity galaxies known, $Z/Z_\odot < 0.05$. Our observations
shed new light onto the longstanding mystery of He II emission in star-forming galaxies: we find
that the equivalent width of the He II $\lambda 4686$ high-ionization emission line does not scale
with that of H$\beta$ in our sample, suggesting that binary evolution or other processes on $>10$
Myr timescales contribute substantially to the $\mathrm{He^+}$-ionizing photon budget in this
metallicity regime. Applying such selection techniques coupled with deep spectroscopy to next-generation
photometric surveys like LSST may eventually provide a basis for an empirical understanding of
metal-poor massive stars.
