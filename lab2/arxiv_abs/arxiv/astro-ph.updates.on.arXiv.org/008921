Modern astronomy has finally been able to observe protoplanetary disks in reasonable resolution
and detail, unveiling the processes happening during planet formation. These observed processes
are understood under the framework of disk-planet interaction, a process studied analytically
and modeled numerically for over 40 years. Long a theoreticians' game, the wealth of observational
data has been allowing for increasingly stringent tests of the theoretical models. Modeling efforts
are crucial to support the interpretation of direct imaging analyses, not just for potential detections
but also to put meaningful upper limits on mass accretion rates and other physical quantities in
current and future large-scale surveys. This white paper addresses the questions of what efforts
on the computational side are required in the next decade to advance our theoretical understanding,
explain the observational data, and guide new observations. We identified the nature of accretion,
ab initio planet formation, early evolution, and circumplanetary disks as major fields of interest
in computational planet formation. We recommend that modelers relax the approximations of alpha-viscosity
and isothermal equations of state, on the grounds that these models use flawed assumptions, even
if they give good visual qualitative agreement with observations. We similarly recommend that
population synthesis move away from 1D hydrodynamics. The computational resources to reach these
goals should be developed during the next decade, through improvements in algorithms and the hardware
for hybrid CPU/GPU clusters. Coupled with high angular resolution and great line sensitivity in
ground based interferometers, ELTs and JWST, these advances in computational efforts should allow
for large strides in the field in the next decade.
