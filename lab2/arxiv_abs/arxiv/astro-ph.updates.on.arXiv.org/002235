Infrared fine-structure emission lines from trace metals are powerful diagnostics of the interstellar
medium in galaxies. We explore the possibility of studying the redshifted far-IR fine-structure
line emission using the three-dimensional (3-D) power spectra obtained with an imaging spectrometer.
The intensity mapping approach measures the spatio-spectral fluctuations due to line emission
from all galaxies, including those below the individual detection threshold. The technique provides
3-D measurements of galaxy clustering and moments of the galaxy luminosity function. Furthermore,
the linear portion of the power spectrum can be used to measure the total line emission intensity
including all sources through cosmic time with redshift information naturally encoded. Total
line emission, when compared to the total star formation activity and/or other line intensities
reveals evolution of the interstellar conditions of galaxies in aggregate. As a case study, we consider
measurement of [CII] autocorrelation in the 0.5 < z < 1.5 epoch, where interloper lines are
minimized, using far-IR/submm balloon-borne and future space-borne instruments with moderate
and high sensitivity, respectively. In this context, we compare the intensity mapping approach
to blind galaxy surveys based on individual detections. We find that intensity mapping is nearly
always the best way to obtain the total line emission because blind, wide-field galaxy surveys lack
sufficient depth and deep pencil beams do not observe enough galaxies in the requisite luminosity
and redshift bins. Also, intensity mapping is often the most efficient way to measure the power spectrum
shape, depending on the details of the luminosity function and the telescope aperture.
