Atmospheric xenon is strongly mass fractionated, the result of a process that apparently continued
through the Archean and perhaps beyond. Previous models that explain Xe fractionation by hydrodynamic
hydrogen escape cannot gracefully explain how Xe escaped when Ar and Kr did not, nor allow Xe to escape
in the Archean. Here we show that Xe is the only noble gas that can escape as an ion in a photo-ionized
hydrogen wind, possible in the absence of a geomagnetic field or along polar magnetic field lines
that open into interplanetary space. To quantify the hypothesis we construct new 1-D models of hydrodynamic
diffusion-limited hydrogen escape from highly-irradiated CO$_2$-H$_2$-H atmospheres. The
models reveal three minimum requirements for Xe escape: solar EUV irradiation needs to exceed $10\times$
that of the modern Sun; the total hydrogen mixing ratio in the atmosphere needs to exceed 1% (equiv.
to 0.5% CH$_4$); and transport amongst the ions in the lower ionosphere needs to lift the Xe ions to
the base of the outflowing hydrogen corona. The long duration of Xe escape implies that, if a constant
process, Earth lost the hydrogen from at least one ocean of water, roughly evenly split between the
Hadean and the Archean. However, to account for both Xe's fractionation and also its depletion with
respect to Kr and primordial $^{244}$Pu, Xe escape must have been limited to small apertures or short
episodes, which suggests that Xe escape was restricted to polar windows by a geomagnetic field,
or dominated by outbursts of high solar activity, or limited to transient episodes of abundant hydrogen,
or a combination of these. Xenon escape stopped when the hydrogen (or methane) mixing ratio became
too small, or EUV radiation from the aging Sun became too weak, or charge exchange between Xe$^+$
and O$_2$ rendered Xe neutral.
