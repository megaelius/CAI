Urea, NH2C(O)NH2, is a molecule of great importance in organic chemistry and biology. Two searches
for urea in the interstellar medium were reported in the past, but neither were conclusive. We want
to take advantage of the increased sensitivity and angular resolution provided by ALMA to search
for urea toward the hot cores embedded in the high-mass star forming region Sgr B2(N). We use the new
spectral line survey ReMoCA performed toward Sgr B2(N) with ALMA in its observing cycle 4. The spectra
are analyzed under the LTE approximation. We construct a full synthetic spectrum that includes
all the molecules identified so far. We use new spectroscopic predictions for urea in its vibrational
ground state and first vibrationally excited state to search for this complex organic molecule
in the ReMoCA data set. We employ the gas-grain chemical kinetics model MAGICKAL to interpret the
astronomical observations. We report the secure detection of urea toward the hot core Sgr B2(N1)
at a position called N1S slightly offset from the continuum peak, which avoids obscuration by the
dust.. We derive a column density of 2.7x10^16 cm-2 for urea, two orders of magnitude lower than formamide,
and one order of magnitude below methyl isocyanate, acetamide, and N-methylformamide. The latter
molecule is reliably identified toward N1S with 60 clearly detected lines, confirming an earlier
claim of its tentative interstellar detection. We report the first interstellar detections of
NH2CH18O and 15NH2CHO. We also report the nondetection of urea toward the secondary hot core Sgr
B2(N2) with an abundance relative to the other four species at least one order of magnitude lower
than toward the main hot core. Our chemical model roughly reproduces the relative abundances of
formamide, methyl isocyanate, acetamide, and N-methylformamide, but it overproduces urea by
at least one order of magnitude.
