We report on the first results of the POLAMI program, a simultaneous 3.5 and 1.3mm full-Stokes-polarisation
monitoring of a sample of 36 of the brightest active galactic nuclei in the northern sky with the IRAM
30m Telescope. Through a systematic statistical study of data taken from October 2006 (from December
2009 for the case of the 1.3mm observations) to August 2014, we characterise the variability of the
total flux density and linear polarisation. We find that all sources in the sample are highly variable
in total flux density at both 3.5 and 1.3mm, as well as in spectral index, that is found to be optically
thin in general. The total flux-density variability at 1.3mm is found, in general, to be faster,
and to have larger amplitude and flatter PSD slopes than 3.5mm. The polarisation degree is on average
larger at 1.3mm than at 3.5mm, by a factor of 2.6. The variability of linear polarisation degree is
faster and has higher fractional amplitude than for total flux density, with the typical time scales
during prominent polarisation peaks being significantly faster at 1.3mm than at 3.5mm. The polarisation
angle at both 3.5 and 1.3mm is highly variable. Most of the sources show one or two excursions of >180
deg. on time scales from a few weeks to about a year during the course of our observations. The 3.5 and
1.3mm polarisation angle evolution follow rather well each other, although the 1.3mm data show
a clear preference to more prominent variability on the short time scales, i.e. weeks. The data are
compatible with multi-zone models of conical jets involving smaller emission regions for the shortest-wavelength
emitting sites. Such smaller emitting regions should also be more efficient in energising particle
populations. The data also favours the integrated emission at 1.3mm to have better ordered magnetic
fields than the one at 3.5mm.
