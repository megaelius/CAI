A comprehensive study of multifrequency correlations can shed light on the nature of variation
for blazars. In this work, we collect the long-term radio, optical and $\gamma$-ray light curves
of PKS 1502+106. After performing the localized cross-correlation function analysis, we find
that correlations between radio and $\gamma$-ray or $V$ band are beyond the $3\sigma$ significance
level. The lag of the $\gamma$-ray relative to 15 GHz is $-60^{+5}_{-10}$ days, translating to a
distance $3.18^{+0.50}_{-0.27}$ parsec (pc) between them. Within uncertainties, the locations
of the $\gamma$-ray and optical emitting regions are roughly the same, and are away from the jet base
within $1.2$ pc. The derived magnetic field in optical and $\gamma$-ray emitting regions is about
$0.36$ G. The logarithm of $\gamma$-ray flux is significantly linearly correlated with that of
$V$ band fluxes, which can be explained by the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) process, the external
Compton (EC) processes, or the combination of them. We find a significant linear correlation in
the plot of $\log\prod$ (polarization degree) versus $\log \nu F_{\nu}$ at $V$ band, and use the
empirical relation $\Pi \sim \sin^n \theta'$ ($\theta'$ is the observing angle in the comoving
frame blob) to explain it. The behaviors of color index (generally redder when brighter at the active
state) and $\gamma$-ray spectral index (softer when brighter) could be well explained by the twisted
jet model. These findings suggest that the curvature effect (mainly due to the change of the viewing
angle) is dominant in the variation phenomena of fluxes, spectral indices, and polarization degrees
for PKS 1502+106.
