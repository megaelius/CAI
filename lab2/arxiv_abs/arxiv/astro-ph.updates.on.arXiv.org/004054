The mechanism behind angular momentum transport in protoplanetary disks, and whether this transport
is turbulent in nature, is a fundamental issue in planet formation studies. Recent ALMA observations
have suggested that turbulent velocities in the outer regions of these disks are less than ~0.05-0.1
times the local sound speed, contradicting theoretical predictions of turbulence driven by the
magnetorotational instability (MRI). These observations have generally been interpreted to
be consistent with a large-scale laminar magnetic wind driving accretion. Here, we carry out local,
shearing box simulations with varying ionization levels and background magnetic field strengths
in order to determine which parameters produce results consistent with observations. We find that
even when the background magnetic field launches a strong largely laminar wind, significant turbulence
persists and is driven by localized regions of vertical magnetic field that are unstable to the MRI.
The only conditions for which we find turbulent velocities below the observational limits are weak
background magnetic fields and ionization levels well below that usually assumed in theoretical
studies. We interpret these findings within the context of a new model in which a large scale magnetic
field, confined to the inner disk, hinders ionizing sources from reaching large radial distances.
Thus, in addition to a wind launched from this large scale field, this new model predicts that for
disks with weakly turbulent outer regions, the outer disk will have significantly reduced ionization
levels compared to standard models and will harbor only a weak vertical magnetic field.
