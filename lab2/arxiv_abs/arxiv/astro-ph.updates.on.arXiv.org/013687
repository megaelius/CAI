High spectral resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio optical spectra of red giants in the globular
cluster Omega Centauri are analysed for stellar parameters and chemical abundances of 15 elements
including helium by either line equivalent widths or synthetic spectrum analyses. The simultaneous
abundance analysis of MgH and Mg lines adopting theoretical photospheres and a combination of He/H$-$ratios
proved to be the only powerful probe to evaluate helium abundances of red giants cooler than 4400
K, wherein otherwise helium line transitions (He {\scs I} 10830 and 5876 \AA) present for a direct
spectral line analysis. The impact of helium-enhanced model photospheres on the resulting abundance
ratios are smaller than 0.15 dex, in agreement with past studies. The first indirect spectroscopic
helium abundances measured in this paper for the most metal-rich cluster members reveal the discovery
of seven He-enhanced giants ($\Delta$$Y=+$0.15$\pm$0.04), the largest such sample found spectroscopically
to date. The average metallicity of $-$0.79$\pm$0.06 dex and abundances for O, Na, Al, Si, Ca, Ti,
Ni, Ba, and La are consistent with values found for the red giant branch (RGB-a) and subgiant branch
(SGB-a) populations of Omega Centauri, suggesting an evolutionary connection among samples.
The He-enhancement in giants is associated with larger $s$-process elemental abundances, which
correlate with Al and anticorrelate with O. These results support the formation of He-enhanced,
metal-rich population of Omega Centauri out of the interstellar medium enriched with the ejecta
of fast rotating massive stars, binaries exploding as supernovae and asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars.
