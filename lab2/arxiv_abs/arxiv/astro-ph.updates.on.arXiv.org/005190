We present a detailed analysis of the stacked frequency spectrum of a large sample of galaxy clusters
using Planck data, together with auxiliary data from the AKARI and IRAS missions. Our primary goal
is to search for the imprint of relativistic corrections to the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect
(tSZ) spectrum, which allow to measure the temperature of the intracluster medium. We remove Galactic
and extragalactic foregrounds with a matched filtering technique, which is validated using simulations
with realistic mock data sets. The extracted spectra show the tSZ signal at high significance and
reveal an additional far-infrared (FIR) excess, which we attribute to thermal emission from the
galaxy clusters themselves. This excess FIR emission from clusters is accounted for in our spectral
model. We are able to measure the tSZ relativistic corrections at $2.2\sigma$ by constraining the
mean temperature of our cluster sample to $4.4^{+2.1}_{-2.0} \, \mathrm{keV}$. We repeat the same
analysis on a subsample containing only the 100 hottest clusters, for which we measure the mean temperature
to be $6.0^{+3.8}_{-2.9} \, \mathrm{keV}$, corresponding to $2.0\sigma$. The temperature of
the emitting dust grains in our FIR model is constrained to $\simeq 20 \, \mathrm{K}$, consistent
with previous studies. Control for systematic biases is done by fitting mock clusters, from which
we also show that using the non-relativistic spectrum for SZ signal extraction will lead to a bias
in the integrated Compton parameter $Y$, which can be up to 14% for the most massive clusters. We conclude
by providing an outlook for the upcoming CCAT-prime telescope, which will improve upon Planck with
lower noise and better spatial resolution.
