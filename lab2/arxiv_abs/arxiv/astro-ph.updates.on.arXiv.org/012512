The {\Lambda} cold dark matter ({\Lambda}CDM) paradigm of galaxy formation predicts that dense
spheroidal stellar structures invariably grow at early cosmic time. These primordial spheroids
evolve toward a virialized dynamical status as they finally become today's elliptical galaxies
and large bulges at the center of disk galaxies. However, observations reveal that small bulges
in spiral galaxies are common in the nearby universe. The prevailing belief that all small bulges
form at later times from internal processes occurring in the disk represents a challenge for the
{\Lambda}CDM scenario. Notably, the coevolution of bulges and central supermassive black holes
(SMBHs) at early phases of galaxy evolution is also at stake. However, observations have so far not
provided conclusive evidence against their possible early origin. Here, we report new observations
of small bulges showing that they follow the mass-velocity dispersion relation expected for virialized
systems. Contrary to previous claims, small bulges bridge the gap between massive ellipticals
and globular clusters. This dynamical picture supports a scenario where systems over seven orders
of magnitude in stellar mass form at early cosmic time. These results alleviate the tension between
{\Lambda}CDM simulations and observations at galactic scales. We hypothesize that these small
bulges are actually the low-mass descendants of compact objects observed at high redshift, also
known as red nuggets, which are consistently produced in cosmological {\Lambda}CDM simulations.
Therefore, this also suggests that the established coevolution of SMBHs and large bulges naturally
extends to spheroids in the low-mass regime.
