The diffuse plasma inside clusters of galaxies has X-ray emitting temperatures of a few keV. The
physical mechanisms that heat this intracluster medium (ICM) to such temperatures include the
accretion shock at the periphery of a galaxy cluster, the shocks driven by merger events, as well
as a somewhat overlooked mechanism -- the dissipation of intracluster turbulent motions. We study
the relative role of these heating mechanisms using galaxy clusters in Lagrangian tracer particle
re-simulations of the Omega500 cosmological simulation. We adopt a novel analysis method of decomposing
the temperature increase at each time step into the contribution from dissipative heating and that
from adiabatic heating. In the high-resolution spatial-temporal map of these heating rates, merger
tracks are clearly visible, demonstrating the dominant role of merger events in heating the ICM.
The dissipative heating contributed by each merger event is extended in time and also occurs in the
rarefaction regions, suggesting the importance of heating by the dissipation of merger-induced
turbulence. Quantitative analysis shows that turbulence heating, rather than direct heating
at merger shocks, dominates the temperature increase of the ICM, especially at inner radii $r < r_{\rm
500c}$. In addition, we find that many merger shocks can propagate with almost constant velocity
to very large radii $r \gg r_{\rm 500c}$, some even reach and join with the accretion shock and becoming
the outer boundary of the ICM. Altogether, these results suggest that the ICM is heated more in an
`inside-out' fashion rather than `outside-in' as depicted in the classical smooth accretion picture.
