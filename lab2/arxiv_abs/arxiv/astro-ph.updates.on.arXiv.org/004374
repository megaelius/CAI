We present ALMA 2-mm continuum and CO (2-1) spectral line imaging of the gravitationally lensed
z=0.654 star-forming/quasar composite RX J1131-1231 at 240-400 mas angular resolution. The continuum
emission is found to be compact and coincident with the optical emission, whereas the molecular
gas forms a complete Einstein ring, which shows strong differential magnification. The de-lensed
source structure is determined on 400-pc resolution using a visibility-fitting lens modelling
technique. The reconstructed molecular gas velocity-field is consistent with a rotating disk
with a maximum rotational velocity of 280 km/s. From dynamical model fitting we find an enclosed
mass M(r<5 kpc)=(1.46+/-0.31)*10^11 M_sol. The molecular gas distribution is highly structured,
with clumps that are co-incident with higher gas velocity dispersion regions 40-50 km/s and with
the intensity peaks in the optical emission, which are associated with sites of on-going turbulent
star-formation. The peak in the CO (2-1) distribution is not co-incident with the AGN, where there
is a paucity of molecular gas emission, possibly due to radiative feedback from the central engine.
The intrinsic molecular gas luminosity is L'_CO=(1.2+/-0.3)*10^10 K km/s pc^2 and the inferred
gas mass is M(H2)=(8.3+/-3.0)*10^10 M_sol, which given its dynamical mass is consistent with a
CO-H2 conversion factor of alpha = 5.5+/-2.0 M_solar(K km/s pc^2)^-1. This suggests that the star-formation
efficiency is dependent on the host galaxy morphology as opposed to the nature of the AGN. The far-infrared
continuum spectral energy distribution shows evidence for heated dust, equivalent to an obscured
star-formation rate of SFR=69^(+41)_(-25)*(7.3/u_IR)M_sol/yr, which demonstrates the composite
star-forming/AGN nature of this system. RX J1131-1231
