Uranus and Neptune, and their diverse satellite and ring systems, represent the least explored
environments of our Solar System, and yet may provide the archetype for the most common outcome of
planetary formation throughout our galaxy. Ice Giants will be the last remaining class of Solar
System planet to have a dedicated orbital explorer, and international efforts are under way to realise
such an ambitious mission in the coming decades. In 2019, the European Space Agency released a call
for scientific themes for its strategic science planning process for the 2030s and 2040s, known
as Voyage 2050. We used this opportunity to review our present-day knowledge of the Uranus and Neptune
systems, producing a revised and updated set of scientific questions and motivations for their
exploration. This review article describes how such a mission could explore their origins, ice-rich
interiors, dynamic atmospheres, unique magnetospheres, and myriad icy satellites, to address
questions at the heart of modern planetary science. These two worlds are superb examples of how planets
with shared origins can exhibit remarkably different evolutionary paths: Neptune as the archetype
for Ice Giants, whereas Uranus may be atypical. Exploring Uranus' natural satellites and Neptune's
captured moon Triton could reveal how Ocean Worlds form and remain active, redefining the extent
of the habitable zone in our Solar System. For these reasons and more, we advocate that an Ice Giant
System explorer should become a strategic cornerstone mission within ESA's Voyage 2050 programme,
in partnership with international collaborators, and targeting launch opportunities in the early
2030s.
