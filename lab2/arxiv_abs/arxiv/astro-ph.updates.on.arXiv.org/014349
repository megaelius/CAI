Context. Massive stars are predicted to excite internal gravity waves (IGWs) by turbulent core
convection and from turbulent pressure fluctuations in their near-surface layers. These IGWs
are extremely efficient at transporting angular momentum and chemical species within stellar
interiors, but remain largely unconstrained observationally. Aims. We aim to characterise the
photometric detection of IGWs across a large number of O and early-B stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram, and explain the ubiquitous detection of stochastic variability in the photospheres of
massive stars. Methods. We combine high-precision time-series photometry from the NASA Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite with high-resolution ground-based spectroscopy of 70 stars with spectral
types O and B to probe the relationship between the photometric signatures of IGWs and parameters
such as spectroscopic mass, luminosity and macroturbulence. Results. A relationship is found
between the location of a star in the spectroscopic Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and the amplitudes
and frequencies of stochastic photometric variability in the light curves of massive stars. Furthermore,
the properties of the stochastic variability are statistically correlated with macroturbulent
velocity broadening in the spectral lines of massive stars. Conclusions. The common ensemble morphology
for the stochastic low-frequency variability detected in space photometry and its relationship
to macroturbulence is strong evidence for IGWs in massive stars, as such waves are unique in providing
the dominant tangential velocity field required to explain the observed spectroscopy.
