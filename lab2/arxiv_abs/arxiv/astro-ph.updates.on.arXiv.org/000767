Un-evolved, very metal-poor stars are the most important tracers of the cosmic abundance of lithium
in the early universe. Combining the standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis model with Galactic production
through cosmic ray spallation, these stars at [Fe/H]<-2 are expected to show an undetectably
small 6Li/7Li isotopic signature. Evidence to the contrary may necessitate an additional pre-galactic
production source or a revision of the standard model of Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We revisit the
isotopic analysis of four halo stars, two with claimed 6Li-detections in the literature, to investigate
the influence of improved model atmospheres and line formation treatment. For the first time, a
combined 3D, NLTE (non-local thermodynamic equilibrium) modelling technique for Li, Na, and Ca
lines is utilised to constrain the intrinsic line-broadening and to determine the Li isotopic ratio.
We discuss the influence of 3D NLTE effects on line profile shapes and assess the realism of our modelling
using the Ca excitation and ionisation balance. By accounting for NLTE line formation in realistic
3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres, we can model the Li resonance line and other neutral lines
with a consistency that is superior to LTE, with no need for additional line asymmetry caused by the
presence of 6Li. Contrary to the results from 1D and 3D LTE modelling, no star in our sample has a significant
2-sigma detection of the lighter isotope in NLTE. Over a large parameter space, NLTE modelling systematically
reduces the best-fit Li isotopic ratios by up to five percentage points. As a bi-product, we also
present the first ever 3D NLTE Ca and Na abundances of halo stars, which reveal significant departures
from LTE. The observational support for a significant and non-standard 6Li production source in
the early universe is substantially weakened by our findings.
