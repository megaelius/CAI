Chemically tagging groups of stars born in the same birth cluster is a major goal of spectroscopic
surveys. To investigate the feasibility of such strong chemical tagging, we perform a blind chemical
tagging experiment on abundances measured from APOGEE survey spectra. We apply a density-based
clustering algorithm to the eight dimensional chemical space defined by [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], [Si/Fe],
[K/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [Mn/Fe], [Fe/H], and [Ni/Fe], abundances ratios which together span multiple
nucleosynthetic channels. In a high quality sample of 182,538 giant stars, we detect twenty-one
candidate clusters with more than fifteen members. Our candidate clusters are more chemically
homogeneous than a population of non-member stars with similar [Mg/Fe] and [Fe/H], even in abundances
not used for tagging. Group members are consistent with having the same age and fall along a single
stellar-population track in logg vs. Teff space. Each group's members are distributed over multiple
kpc, and the spread in their radial and azimuthal actions increases with age. We qualitatively reproduce
this increase using N-body simulations of cluster dissolution in Galactic potentials that include
transient winding spiral arms. Observing our candidate birth clusters with high-resolution spectroscopy
in other wavebands to investigate their chemical homogeneity in other nucleosynthetic groups
will be essential to confirming the efficacy of strong chemical tagging. Our initially spatially-compact
but now widely dispersed candidate clusters will provide novel limits on chemical evolution and
orbital diffusion in the Galactic disc, and constraints on star formation in loosely-bound groups.
