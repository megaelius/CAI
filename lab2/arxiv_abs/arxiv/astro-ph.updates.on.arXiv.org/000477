Pre-transitional disks are protoplanetary disks with a gapped disk structure, potentially indicating
the presence of young planets in these systems. In order to explore the structure of these objects
and their gap-opening mechanism, we observed the pre-transitional disk V1247 Orionis using the
Very Large Telescope Interferometer, the Keck Interferometer, Keck-II, Gemini South, and IRTF.
This allows us spatially resolve the AU-scale disk structure from near- to mid-infrared wavelengths
(1.5 to 13 {\mu}m), tracing material at different temperatures and over a wide range of stellocentric
radii. Our observations reveal a narrow, optically-thick inner-disk component (located at 0.18
AU from the star) that is separated from the optically thick outer disk (radii >46 AU), providing
unambiguous evidence for the existence of a gap in this pre-transitional disk. Surprisingly, we
find that the gap region is filled with significant amounts of optically thin material with a carbon-dominated
dust mineralogy. The presence of this optically thin gap material cannot be deduced solely from
the spectral energy distribution, yet it is the dominant contributor at mid-infrared wavelengths.
Furthermore, using Keck/NIRC2 aperture masking observations in the H, K', and L' band, we detect
asymmetries in the brightness distribution on scales of about 15-40 AU, i.e. within the gap region.
The detected asymmetries are highly significant, yet their amplitude and direction changes with
wavelength, which is not consistent with a companion interpretation but indicates an inhomogeneous
distribution of the gap material. We interpret this as strong evidence for the presence of complex
density structures, possibly reflecting the dynamical interaction of the disk material with sub-stellar
mass bodies that are responsible for the gap clearing.
