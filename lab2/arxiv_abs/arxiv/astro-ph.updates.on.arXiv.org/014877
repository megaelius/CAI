A magnetic disc wind is an important mechanism that may be responsible for driving accretion and
structure formation in protoplanetary discs. Recent numerical simulations have shown that these
winds can take either the traditional `hourglass' symmetry about the mid-plane, or a `slanted'
symmetry dominated by a mid-plane toroidal field of a single sign. The formation of this slanted
symmetry state has not previously been explained. We use radially local 1D vertical shearing box
simulations to assess the importance of large-scale MRI channel modes in influencing the formation
and morphologies of these wind solutions. We consider only Ohmic resistivity and explore the effect
of different magnetisations, with the mid-plane $\beta$ parameter ranging from $10^5$ to $10^2$.
We find that our magnetic winds go through three stages of development: cyclic, transitive and steady,
with the steady wind taking a slanted symmetry profile similar to those observed in local and global
simulations. We show that the cycles are driven by periodic excitation of the $n=2$ or $3$ MRI channel
mode coupled with advective eviction, and that the transition to the steady wind is caused by a much
more slowly growing $n=1$ mode altering the wind structure. Saturation is achieved through a combination
of advective damping from the strong wind, and suppression of the instability due to a strong toroidal
field. A higher disc magnetisation leads to a greater tendency towards, and more rapid settling
into the slanted symmetry steady wind, which may have important implications for mass and flux transport
processes in protoplanetary discs.
