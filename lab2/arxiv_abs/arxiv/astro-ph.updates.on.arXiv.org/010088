The chemical composition of high-mass protostars reflects the physical evolution associated
with different stages of star formation. In this study, the molecular inventory of the forming high-mass
star AFGL 4176 is studied in detail at high angular resolution (~0.35 arcsec) using ALMA. This high
resolution makes it possible to separate the emission associated with the inner hot envelope and
disk around the forming star from that of its cool outer envelope. In addition, the high sensitivity
of ALMA makes it possible to identify weak and optically thin lines and allows for many isotopologues
to be detected, providing a more complete and accurate inventory of the source. A total of 23 different
molecular species and their isotopologues are detected in the spectrum towards AFGL 4176. The most
abundant species is methanol (CH3OH), remaining species are present at levels between 0.003 % and
15 % with respect to CH3OH. Hints that N-bearing species peak slightly closer to the location of the
peak continuum emission than the O-bearing species are seen. AFGL 4176 comprises a rich chemical
inventory including many complex species present on disk-scales. On average, the derived column
density ratios with respect to methanol of O-bearing species are higher than those derived for N-bearing
species by a factor of three. This may indicate that AFGL 4176 is a relatively young source since nitrogen
chemistry generally takes longer to evolve in the gas-phase. Taking methanol as a reference, the
composition of AFGL 4176 more closely resembles that of the low-mass protostar IRAS 16293-2422B
than that of high-mass star-forming regions located near the Galactic centre. This similarity
hints that the chemical composition of complex species is already set in the cold cloud stage and
implies that AFGL 4176 is a young source whose chemical composition has not yet been strongly processed
by the central protostar.
