We report the discovery of a putative radio relic, 830 kpc in length and found toward the outskirts
of galaxy cluster Abell 1697 ($z=0.181$), using the LOFAR Two Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS) at 144 MHz.
With an X-ray-inferred mass of $M_{500}^{X-ray}=2.9^{+0.8}_{-0.7}\times10^{14}~\rm{M_{\odot}}$,
this places Abell 1697 among the least massive relic hosts. The relic is also detected at 325 MHz in
the Westerbork Northern Sky Survey (WENSS) and at 1.4 GHz in the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) with an
average spectral index of $\alpha(144,325,1400~\rm{MHz})=-0.98\pm0.01$ and magnetic field
of $B_{eq}\sim0.6~\mu$G. This relic, located in the northeast periphery of the cluster, is 300
kpc wide, exhibits a gradual spectral steepening across the width ($\alpha_{144 \rm{MHz}}^{1.4\rm{GHz}}(inj)=-0.70\pm0.11$
to $\alpha_{144 \rm{MHz}}^{1.4\rm{GHz}}(edge)=-1.19\pm0.15$), as well as indications of a
co-spatial X-ray (ROSAT) shock and the radio relic emission. The radio power of the relic is $P_{1.4GHz}=8.5\pm1.1\times10^{23}~\rm{W\;Hz^{-1}}$,
which is found to be in good agreement with the expected empirical correlation between the radio
power and Largest Linear Size (LLS) of relics. The relic is trailed by extended ($790\times550$
kpc) diffuse radio emission towards the cluster center, that is likely an ultra-steep spectrum
($\alpha_{144 \rm{MHz}}^{1.4\rm{GHz}}<-1.84$) radio source. This structure is also found to
be older by at least 190 Myrs, has a very low surface brightness of $0.3~\mu$Jy arcsec$^{-2}$ and
magnetic field $B_{eq}\sim0.8~\mu$G, similar to that of a radio phoenix. Finally, we discuss the
possible mechanisms responsible for the relic and the trailing diffuse radio emission, invoking
re-acceleration due to wake turbulence, as well as the revival of fossil electrons from an old AGN
activity by the cluster merger shocks.
