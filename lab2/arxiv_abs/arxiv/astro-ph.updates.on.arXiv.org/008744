Inelasticity--the fraction of a neutrino's energy transferred to hadrons--is a quantity of interest
in the study of astrophysical and atmospheric neutrino interactions at multi-TeV energies with
IceCube. In this work, a sample of contained neutrino interactions in IceCube is obtained from 5
years of data and classified as 2650 tracks and 965 cascades. Tracks arise predominantly from charged-current
$\nu_{\mu}$ interactions, and we demonstrate that we can reconstruct their energy and inelasticity.
The inelasticity distribution is found to be consistent with the calculation of Cooper-Sarkar
et al. across the energy range from $\sim$ 1 TeV to $\sim$ 100 TeV. Along with cascades from neutrinos
of all flavors, we also perform a fit over the energy, zenith angle, and inelasticity distribution
to characterize the flux of astrophysical and atmospheric neutrinos. The energy spectrum of diffuse
astrophysical neutrinos is well-described by a power-law in both track and cascade samples, and
a best-fit index $\gamma=2.62\pm0.07$ is found in the energy range from 3.5 TeV to 2.6 PeV. Limits
are set on the astrophysical flavor composition that are compatible with a ratio of $\left(\frac{1}{3}:\frac{1}{3}:\frac{1}{3}\right)_{\oplus}$.
Exploiting the distinct inelasticity distribution of $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ interactions,
the atmospheric $\nu_{\mu}$ to $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ flux ratio in the energy range from 770 GeV to
21 TeV is found to be $0.77^{+0.44}_{-0.25}$ times the calculation by Honda et al. Lastly, the inelasticity
distribution is also sensitive to neutrino charged-current charm production. The data are consistent
with a leading-order calculation, with zero charm production excluded at $91\%$ confidence level.
Future analyses of inelasticity distributions may probe new physics that affects neutrino interactions
both in and beyond the Standard Model.
