Most of the massive star-forming galaxies are found to have `inside-out' stellar mass growth modes,
which means the inner parts of the galaxies mainly consist of the older stellar population, while
the star forming in the outskirt of the galaxy is still ongoing. The high-resolution HST images from
Hubble Deep UV Legacy Survey (HDUV) and Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy
Survey (CANDELS) projects with the unprecedented depth in both F275W and F160W bands are the perfect
data sets to study the forming and formed stellar distribution directly. We selected the low redshift
($0.05 < z_{\rm spec} < 0.3$) galaxy sample from the GOODS-North field where the HST F275W and F160W
images are available. Then we measured the half light radius in F275W and F160W bands, which are the
indicators of the star formation and stellar mass. By comparing the F275W and F160W half light radius,
we find the massive galaxies are mainly follow the `inside-out' growth which is consistent with
the previous results. Moreover, the HST F275W and F160W images reveal that some of the low-mass galaxies
($<10^8M_\odot$) have the `outside-in' growth mode: their images show a compact UV morphology,
implying an ongoing star formation in the galaxy centre, the stars in the outskirts of the galaxies
are already formed. The two modes transit smoothly at stellar mass range about $10^{8-9}M_\odot$
with a large scatter. We also try to identify the possible neighbour massive galaxies from the SDSS
data, which represent the massive galaxy sample. We find that all of the spec-z selected galaxies
have no massive galaxy nearby. Thus the `outside-in' mode we find in the low-mass galaxies are not
likely originated from the environment.
