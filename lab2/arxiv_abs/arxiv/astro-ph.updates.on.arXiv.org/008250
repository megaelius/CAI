The Sun features on its surface typical flow patterns called the granulation, mesogranulation,
and supergranulation. These patterns arise due to convective flows transporting energy from the
interior of the Sun to its surface. In this paper we will shed light on the interaction between the
convective flows in large-scale cells as well as the large-scale magnetic fields in active regions,
and investigate in detail the statistical distribution of flow velocities during the evolution
and formation of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) active region 11190.
To do so, we employed local correlation tracking methods on data obtained by the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO) spacecraft in the continuum as well as on processed line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms. We
find that the flow fields in an active region can be modelled by a two-component distribution. One
component is very stable, follows a Rayleigh distribution, and can be assigned to the background
flows, whilst the other component is variable in strength and velocity range and can be attributed
to the flux emergence visible both in the continuum maps as well as magnetograms. Generally, the
plasma flows, as seen by the distribution of the magnitude of the velocity, follow a Rayleigh distribution
even through the time of formation of active regions. However, at certain moments of large-scale
fast flux emergence, a second component featuring higher velocities is formed in the velocity magnitudes
distribution. The plasma flows are generally highly correlated to the motion of magnetic elements
and vice versa except during the times of fast magnetic flux emergence as observed by rising magnetic
elements. At these times, the magnetic fields are found to move faster than the corresponding plasma.
