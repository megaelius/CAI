We explore the connection between the ultra-violet (UV) luminosity functions (LFs) of high-$z$
galaxies and the distribution of stellar masses and star-formation histories (SFHs) in their host
dark matter halos. We provide a baseline for a redshift-independent star-formation efficiency
model to which observations and models can be compared. Our model assigns a star-formation rate
(SFR) to each dark matter halo based on the growth rate of the halo and a redshift-independent star-formation
efficiency. The dark matter halo accretion rate is obtained from a high-resolution $N$-body simulation
in order to capture the stochasticity in accretion histories and to obtain spatial information
for the distribution of galaxies. The halo mass dependence of the star-formation efficiency is
calibrated at $z=4$ by requiring a match to the observed UV LF at this redshift. The model then correctly
predicts the observed UV LF at $z=5-10$. We present predictions for the UV luminosity and stellar
mass functions, JWST number counts, and SFHs. In particular, we find a stellar-to-halo mass relation
at $z=4-10$ that scales with halo mass at $M_{\rm h}<10^{11}~M_{\odot}$ as $M_{\star}\propto
M_{\rm h}^2$, with a normalization that is higher than the relation inferred at $z=0$. The average
SFRs increase as a function of time to $z=4$, although there is significant scatter around the average:
about 4% of the $z=4$ galaxies show no significant mass growth. Using these SFHs, we present redshift-dependent
UV-to-SFR conversion factors, mass return fractions and mass-to-light ratios for different IMFs
and metallicities, finding that current estimates of the cosmic SFR density at $z\sim10$ may be
overestimated by $\sim0.1-0.2~\mathrm{dex}$.
