RX~J1604.3-2130A is a young, dipper-type, variable star in the Upper Scorpius association, suspected
to have an inclined inner disk with respect to its face-on outer disk. We study the eclipses to constrain
the inner disk properties.We use time-resolved photometry from the Rapid Eye Mount telescope and
Kepler2 data to study the multi-wavelength variability, and archival optical and IR data to track
accretion, rotation, and changes in disk structure. The observations reveal details of the structure
and matter transport through the inner disk. The eclipses show 5d quasi-periodicity, with the phase
drifting in time and some periods showing increased/decreased eclipse depth and frequency. Dips
are consistent with extinction by slightly processed dust grains in an inclined, irregularly-shaped
inner disk locked to the star through two relatively stable accretion structures. The grains are
located near the dust sublimation radius ($\sim$0.09 au) at the corotation radius, and can explain
the shadows observed in the outer disk. The total mass (gas and dust) required to produce the eclipses
and shadows is a few % of a Ceres mass. Such amount of mass is accreted/replenished by accretion in
days to weeks, which explains the variability from period to period. Spitzer and WISE variability
reveal variations in the dust content in the innermost disk on a few years timescale, which is consistent
with small imbalances (compared to the stellar accretion rate) in the matter transport from the
outer to the inner disk. A decrease in the accretion rate is observed at the times of less eclipsing
variability and low mid-IR fluxes, confirming this picture. The v$sini$=16km/s confirms that
the star cannot be aligned with the outer disk, but is likely close to equator-on and to be aligned
with the inner disk. This anomalous orientation is a challenge for standard theories of protoplanetary
disk formation.
