We present the MARD-Y3 catalog of between 1086 and 2171 galaxy clusters produced using multi-component
matched filter (MCMF) followup in $5000 ~\mathrm{deg}^2$ of DES-Y3 optical data of the ~20000 2RXS
X-ray sources. MCMF is used to identify optical counterparts as peaks in galaxy richness as a function
of redshift along the line of sight toward each 2RXS source within a search region informed by an X-ray
prior. All peaks are assigned a probability $f_\mathrm{cont}$ of being a random superposition
$f_\mathrm{cont}$ is extracted from the galaxy richness distributions along large numbers of
random lines of sight, and the catalog size depends on the $f_\mathrm{cont}$ cuts. The catalog covers
a redshift range of 0.02<z<1.1 with more than 100 clusters at $z>0.5$, and it has residual contamination
of between 2.6% and 9.6% for the cuts adopted here. For each cluster we present the optical center,
redshift, rest frame X-ray luminosity, $M_{500}$ mass and estimators of dynamical state. The cluster
photometric redshifts are high quality with $\sigma_{\Delta z/(1+z)}=0.0046$. Using coincidence
with NWAY infrared sources, we develop a method for excluding ~50% of remaining random superpositions
from the catalog and show that ~1% of clusters exhibit evidence of X-ray luminosity boosting from
emission by cluster AGN. Extensive comparison with other cluster catalogs (MCXC, RM, SPT-SZ, Planck)
is performed to test consistency. We measure the cluster X-ray luminosity function and compare
it to the expectation from a fiducial cosmology and externally calibrated luminosity- and richness-mass
relations with intrinsic scatter. Agreement is good, providing evidence that the MARD-Y3 sample
has low contamination and can be understood as a simple two step selection-- X-ray and then optical--
of an underlying cluster population described by the halo mass function.
