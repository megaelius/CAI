In order to better understand the relationship between feedback and galactic chemical evolution,
we have developed a new model for stellar feedback at grid resolutions of only a few parsecs in global
disk simulations, using the adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code Enzo. For the first time
in galaxy scale simulations, we simulate detailed stellar feedback from individual stars including
asymptotic giant branch winds, photoelectric heating, Lyman-Werner radiation, ionizing radiation
tracked through an adaptive ray-tracing radiative transfer method, and core collapse and Type
Ia supernovae. We furthermore follow the star-by-star chemical yields using tracer fields for
15 metal species: C, N, O, Na, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Mn, Fe, Ni, As, Sr, Y, and Ba. We include the yields ejected
in massive stellar winds, but greatly reduce the winds' velocities due to computational constraints.
We describe these methods in detail in this work and present the first results from 500~Myr of evolution
of an isolated dwarf galaxy with properties similar to a Local Group, low-mass dwarf galaxy. We demonstrate
that our physics and feedback model is capable of producing a dwarf galaxy whose evolution is consistent
with observations in both the Kennicutt-Schmidt relationship and extended Schmidt relationship.
Effective feedback drives outflows with a greater metallicity than the ISM, leading to low metal
retention fractions consistent with observations. Finally, we demonstrate that these simulations
yield valuable information on the variation in mixing behavior of individual metal species within
the multi-phase interstellar medium.
