Context: TESS has been successfully launched and has begin data acquisition. To expedite the science
that may be performed with the resulting data it is necessary to gain a good understanding of planetary
yields. Given the observing strategy employed by TESS the probability of detecting single transits
in long period systems is increased. These systems require careful consideration. Aims: To simulate
the number of TESS transit detections during its 2 year mission with a particular emphasis on single
transits. Additionally, to determine the feasibility of ground-based follow-up observations
from a single site. Methods: A distribution of planets is simulated around the $\sim$ 4 million stars
in the TESS Candidate Target List. These planets are tested for detectable transits and characterised.
Based on simulated parameters the single transit detections are further analysed to determine
which are amenable to ground-based follow-up. Results: TESS will discover an approximate lower
bound of 4700 planets with around 460 being single transits. A large fraction of these will be observable
from a single ground-based site. This paper finds that, in a single year, approximately 1000 transit
events of around 320 unique TESS single transit detections are theoretically observable. Conclusions:
As we consider longer period exoplanets the need for exploring single transit detections increases.
For periods $\gtrsim45$ days the number of single transit detections outnumber multitransits
by a factor of 3 (82$\pm$18 and 25$\pm$7 respectively) a factor which only grows as longer period
detections are considered. Therefore, it is worth expending the extra effort required to follow-up
these more challenging, but potentially very rewarding, discoveries. Additionally, we conclude
that a large fraction of these targets can be theoretically observed from just a single ground-based
site.
