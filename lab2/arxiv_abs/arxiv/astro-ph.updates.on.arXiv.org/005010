Clusters or associations of early-type stars are often associated with a 'superbubble' of hot gas.
The formation of such superbubbles is caused by the feedback from massive stars. The complex N206
in the Large Magellanic Cloud exhibits a superbubble and a rich massive star population. We observed
these massive stars using the FLAMES multi-object spectrograph at ESO-VLT. Available UV spectra
from HST, IUE, and FUSE are also used. The spectral analysis is performed with Potsdam Wolf-Rayet
(PoWR) model atmospheres. We present the stellar and wind parameters of the OB stars and the two WR
binaries in the N206 complex. Twelve percent of the sample show Oe/Be type emission lines, although
most of them appear to rotate far below critical. We found eight runaway stars based on their radial
velocity. The wind-momentum luminosity relation of our OB sample is consistent with the expectations.
The HRD of the OB stars reveals a large age spread (1-30 Myr), suggesting different episodes of star
formation in the complex. The youngest stars are concentrated in the inner part of the complex, while
the older OB stars are scattered over outer regions. We derived the present day mass function for
the entire N206 complex as well as for the cluster NGC2018. Three very massive Of stars are found to
dominate the feedback among 164 OB stars in the sample. The two WR winds alone release about as much
mechanical luminosity as the whole OB star sample. The cumulative mechanical feedback from all
massive stellar winds is comparable to the combined mechanical energy of the supernova explosions
that likely occurred in the complex. Accounting also for the WR wind and supernovae, the mechanical
input over the last five Myr is ~$2.3\times10^{52}$ erg, which exceeds the current energy content
of the complex by more than a factor of five. The morphology of the complex suggests a leakage of hot
gas from the superbubble.
