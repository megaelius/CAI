Solar flares are associated with intense soft X-ray emission generated by the hot flaring plasma.
Kink unstable twisted flux-ropes provide a source of magnetic energy which can be released impulsively
and account for the flare plasma heating. We compute the temporal evolution of the thermal X-ray
emission in kink-unstable coronal loops using MHD simulations and discuss the results of with respect
to solar flare observations. The model consists of a highly twisted loop embedded in a region of uniform
and untwisted coronal magnetic field. We let the kink instability develop, compute the evolution
of the plasma properties in the loop (density, temperature) without accounting for mass exchange
with the chromosphere. We then deduce the X-ray emission properties of the plasma during the whole
flaring episode. During the initial phase of the instability plasma heating is mostly adiabatic.
Ohmic diffusion takes over as the instability saturates, leading to strong and impulsive heating
(> 20 MK), to a quick enhancement of X-ray emission and to the hardening of the thermal X-ray spectrum.
The temperature distribution of the plasma becomes broad, with the emission measure depending
strongly on temperature. Significant emission measures arise for plasma at temperatures T >
9 MK. The magnetic flux-rope then relaxes progressively towards a lower energy state as it reconnects
with the background flux. The loop plasma suffers smaller sporadic heating events but cools down
conductively. The total thermal X-ray emission slowly fades away during this phase, and the high
temperature component of emission measure distribution converges to the power-law distribution
$EM\propto T^{-4.2}$. The amount of twist deduced directly from the X-ray emission patterns is
considerably lower than the maximum magnetic twist in the simulated flux-ropes.
