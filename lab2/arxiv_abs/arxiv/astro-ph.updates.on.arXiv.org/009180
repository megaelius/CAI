Two fundamental properties of stellar magnetic fields have been determined by observations for
a significant number of F, G and K stars with different Rossby numbers (Ro), namely, the magnetic
field strength and the magnetic cycle period. The field strength exhibits two regimes: 1) for fast
rotation it is independent of Ro, 2) for slow rotation the field decays with Ro following a power law.
For the magnetic cycle period two regimes of activity, the so called active and inactive branches,
also have been identified. For both of them, the longer the rotation period, the longer the activity
cycle. Using global dynamo simulations of solar like stars with Rossby numbers between ~0.4 and
~2, this paper explores the relevance of rotational shear layers in determining these observational
properties. Our results are consistent with non-linear alpha^2-Omega dynamos with different
modes and levels of complexity. They show that the total magnetic field strength is independent
of the rotation period. Yet at surface levels, the origin of the magnetic field is determined by Ro.
While for Ro <~ 1 it is generated in the convection zone, for Ro >~ 1 strong toroidal fields are generated
at the tachocline and are rapidly transported to the surface. In agreement with the observations,
the magnetic cycle period increases with the rotational period. All the periods are consistent
with the active branch of activity. However, a bifurcation is observed for Ro ~ 1, separating a regime
where the oscillatory dynamo operates mainly in the convection zone, from the regime where the tachocline
has a predominant role. In the latter the periods are believed to result from the periodic energy
exchange between the dynamo and the magneto-shear instabilities developing in the bottom of the
convection zone and in the radiative interior.
