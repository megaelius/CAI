In the work, we explore the role of jet properties in the spectral evolution for a sample of Fermi-LAT
bright blazars composed primarily by flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). We introduce a near-equipartition
log-parabola (NELP) model to fit the quasi-simultaneous multi-waveband spectral energy distributions
(SEDs). The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is employed to determine the best values of spectral
parameters and its errors. The correlations of synchrotron peak luminosity $L_{pk}^*$ and its
peak frequency $\nu_{pk}^*$, SSC-dominant factor $\xi_s$ and $\nu_{pk}^*$, and their implications
as to the spectral evolution were studied. The statistical analysis and the comparison with theoretical
approximation indicate that: (1)the spectral evolution in $L_{pk}^*-\nu_{pk}^*$ plane may not
only ascribed to variation of the characteristic energy $\gamma_{br}^\prime$ of the employed
electron energy distribution (EED), but that other quantities must be varying as well.(2) for the
spectral evolution in $\xi_s-\nu_{pk}^*$ plane the magnetic field $B^\prime$ may play the dominant
role, and $\gamma_{br}^\prime$ may be considered to be the subdominant role. (3) Variation of the
beaming factor $\delta_b$ may be mainly responsible for the absence of a possible correlation,
since $B^\prime$ is strongly anti-correlated with the size of radiation zone $R_b^\prime$. The
relation is agreement with that derived from the analytical theory, and should be self-consistent
with the underling acceleration mechanism of the employed EED. By assuming a conical jet with opening
angle $\theta_{op}\sim1/\Gamma_b$, we find that the $\gamma$-ray emission site being located
at a distance $\sim10^{17}-10^{19}$ cm.
