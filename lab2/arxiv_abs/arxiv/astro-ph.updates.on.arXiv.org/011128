The magnetic field outside the earth is in good approximation a harmonic vector field determined
by its values at the earth's surface. The direction problem seeks to determine harmonic vector fields
vanishing at infinity and with prescribed direction of the field vector at the surface. In general
this type of data does neither guarantee existence nor uniqueness of solutions of the corresponding
nonlinear boundary value problem. To determine conditions for existence, to specify the non-uniqueness,
and to identify cases of uniqueness is of particular interest when modeling the earth's (or any other
celestial body's) magnetic field from these data. Here we consider the case of {\em axisymmetric}
harmonic fields $\BB$ outside the sphere $S^2 \subset \real^3$. We introduce a rotation number
$\ro \in \ints$ along a meridian of $S^2$ for any axisymmetric H\"older continuous direction field
$\DD \neq 0$ on $S^2$ and, moreover, the (exact) decay order $3 \leq \de \in \ints$ of any axisymmetric
harmonic field $\BB$ at infinity. Fixing a meridional plane and in this plane $\ro - \de +1 \geq 0$
points $z_n$ (symmetric with respect to the symmetry axis and with $|z_n| > 1$, $n = 1,\ldots,\rho-\de
+1$), we prove the existence of an (up to a positive constant factor) unique harmonic field $\BB$
vanishing at $z_n$ and nowhere else, with decay order $\de$ at infinity, and with direction $\DD$
at $S^2$. The proof is based on the global solution of a nonlinear elliptic boundary value problem,
which arises from a complex analytic ansatz for the axisymmetric harmonic field in the meridional
plane. The coefficients of the elliptic equation are discontinuous and singular at the symmetry
axis, which requires solution techniques that are adapted to this special situation.
