Modern observations of the interstellar medium (ISM) in galaxies detect a variety of atomic and
molecular species. The goal is to connect these observations to the astrochemical properties of
the ISM. 3D hydro-chemical simulations attempt this but due to extreme computational cost, they
have to rely on simplified chemical networks and are bound to individual case studies. We present
an alternative approach which models the ISM at larger scales by an ensemble of pre-calculated 1D
thermo-chemical photodissociation region (PDR) calculations that determine the abundance and
excitation of atomic and molecular species. We adopt lognormal distributions of column density
(\avpdf s) for which each column density is linked to a volume density as derived by hydrodynamical
simulations. We consider two lognormal {\avpdf}s: a diffuse, low density medium with average visual
extinction of $\overline{{\rm A}_V}=0.75\,{\rm mag}$ and dispersion of $\sigma=0.5$ and a denser
giant molecular cloud with $\overline{{\rm A}_V}=4\,{\rm mag}$ and $\sigma=0.8$. We treat the
UV radiation field, cosmic-ray ionization rate and metallicity as free parameters. We find that
the low density medium remains fully HI- and CII-dominated under all explored conditions. The denser
cloud remains almost always molecular (i.e. H$_2$-dominated) while its carbon phase (CO, CI and
CII) is sensitive to the above free parameters, implying that existing methods of tracing H$_2$-rich
gas may require adjustments depending on environment. Our numerical framework can be used to estimate
the PDR properties of large ISM regions and quantify trends with different environmental parameters
as it is fast, covers wide parameter space, and is flexible for extensions.
