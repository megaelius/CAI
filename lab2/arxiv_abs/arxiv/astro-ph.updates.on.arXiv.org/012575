Rotation period measurements of stars observed with the Kepler mission have revealed a lack of stars
at intermediate rotation periods, accompanied by a decrease of photometric variability. Whether
this so-called dearth region is a peculiarity of stars in the Kepler field, or reflects a general
manifestation of stellar magnetic activity, is still under debate. Our goal is to measure stellar
rotation periods and photometric variabilities for tens of thousands of K2 stars, located in different
fields along the ecliptic plane, to shed light on the relation between stellar rotation and photometric
variability. We use Lomb-Scargle periodograms, auto-correlation and wavelet functions to determine
consistent rotation periods. Stellar brightness variability is assessed by computing the variability
range from the light curve. We further apply Gaussian mixture models to search for bimodality in
the rotation period distribution. Combining measurements from all K2 campaigns, we detect rotation
periods in 29,860 stars. For effective temperatures below 6000K, the variability range shows a
local minimum at different periods, consistent with an isochrone age of 750 Myr. Additionally,
the K2 rotation period distribution shows evidence for bimodality, although the dearth region
is less pronounced compared to the Kepler field. The period at the dip of the bimodal distribution
shows good agreement with the period at the local variability minimum. We conclude that the period
bimodality is present in different fields of the sky, and is hence a general manifestation of stellar
magnetic activity. The reduced variability in the dearth region is interpreted as a cancelation
between dark spots and bright faculae. Our results strongly advocate that the role of faculae has
been underestimated so far, suggesting a more complex dependence of the brightness variability
on the rotation period.
