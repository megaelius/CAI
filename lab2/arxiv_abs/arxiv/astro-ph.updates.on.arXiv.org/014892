Telescope and detector developments continuously enable deeper and more detailed studies of astronomical
objects. Larger collecting areas, improvement in dispersion and detector techniques, and higher
sensitivities allow detection of more molecules in a single observation, at lower abundances,
resulting in better constraints of the targets physical and chemical conditions. Improvements
on current telescopes, and not to mention future observatories, both in space and on the ground,
will continue this trend, ever improving our understanding of the Universe. Planetary exploration
missions carry instrumentation to unexplored areas, and reveal details impossible to observe
from the Earth by performing in-situ measurements. Space based observatories allow observations
of object at wavelength ranges absorbed by the Earths atmosphere. The depth of understanding from
all of these studies can be greatly enhanced by combining observations: ground-based and space-based,
low-resolution and high-resolution, local and global-scale, similar observations over a broader
or different spectra range, or by providing temporal information through follow-ups. Combined
observations provide context and a broader scope of the studied object, and in this white paper,
we outline a number of studies where observations are synergistically applied to increase the scientific
value of both datasets. Examples include atmospheric studies of Venus, Mars, Titan, comets, Jupiter,
as well as more specific cases describing synergistic studies in the Juno mission, and ground-based
radar studies for near Earth objects. The examples aim to serve as inspiration for future synergistic
observations, and recommendations are made based on the lessons learned from these examples.
