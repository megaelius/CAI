Context. Differential rotation has a strong influence on stellar internal dynamics and evolution,
notably by triggering hydrodynamical instabilities, by interacting with the magnetic field,
and more generally by inducing transport of angular momentum and chemical elements. Moreover,
it modifies the way waves propagate in stellar interiors and thus the frequency spectrum of these
waves, the regions they probe, and the transport they generate. Aims. We investigate the impact
of a general differential rotation (both in radius and latitude) on the propagation of axisymmetric
gravito-inertial waves. Methods. We use a small-wavelength approximation to obtain a local dispersion
relation for these waves. We then describe the propagation of waves thanks to a ray model that follows
a Hamiltonian formalism. Finally, we numerically probe the properties of these gravito-inertial
rays for different regimes of radial and latitudinal differential rotation. Results. We derive
a local dispersion relation that includes the effect of a general differential rotation. Subsequently,
considering a polytropic stellar model, we observe that differential rotation allows for a large
variety of resonant cavities that can be probed by gravito-inertial waves. We identify that for
some regimes of frequency and differential rotation, the properties of gravito-inertial rays
are similar to those found in the uniformly rotating case. Furthermore, we also find new regimes
specific to differential rotation, where the dynamics of rays is chaotic. Conclusions. As a consequence,
we expect modes to follow the same trend. Some parts of oscillation spectra corresponding to regimes
similar to those of the uniformly rotating case would exhibit regular patterns, while parts corresponding
to the new regimes would be mostly constituted of chaotic modes with a spectrum rather characterised
by a generic statistical distribution.
