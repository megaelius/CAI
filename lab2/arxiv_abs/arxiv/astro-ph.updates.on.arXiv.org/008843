Large surveys of galaxy clusters with the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes, including CLASH
and the Frontier Fields, have demonstrated the power of strong gravitational lensing to efficiently
deliver large samples of high-redshift galaxies. We extend this strategy through a wider, shallower
survey named RELICS, the Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey. This survey, described here, was
designed primarily to deliver the best and brightest high-redshift candidates from the first billion
years after the Big Bang. RELICS observed 41 massive galaxy clusters with Hubble and Spitzer at 0.4-1.7um
and 3.0-5.0um, respectively. We selected 21 clusters based on Planck PSZ2 mass estimates and the
other 20 based on observed or inferred lensing strength. Our 188-orbit Hubble Treasury Program
obtained the first high-resolution near-infrared images of these clusters to efficiently search
for lensed high-redshift galaxies. We observed 46 WFC3/IR pointings (~200 arcmin^2) with two orbits
divided among four filters (F105W, F125W, F140W, and F160W) and ACS imaging as needed to achieve
single-orbit depth in each of three filters (F435W, F606W, and F814W). As previously reported by
Salmon et al., we discovered 322 z ~ 6 - 10 candidates, including the brightest known at z ~ 6, and the
most distant spatially-resolved lensed arc known at z ~ 10. Spitzer IRAC imaging (945 hours awarded,
plus 100 archival) has crucially enabled us to distinguish z ~ 10 candidates from z ~ 2 interlopers.
For each cluster, two HST observing epochs were staggered by about a month, enabling us to discover
11 supernovae, including 3 lensed supernovae, which we followed up with 20 orbits from our program.
We delivered reduced HST images and catalogs of all clusters to the public via MAST and reduced Spitzer
images via IRSA. We have also begun delivering lens models of all clusters, to be completed before
the JWST GO call for proposals.
