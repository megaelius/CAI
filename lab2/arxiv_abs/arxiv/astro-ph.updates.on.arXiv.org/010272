We test the ability of Schwarzschild's orbit superposition method in measuring the mass content,
scale radius and shape of a flattened dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Until now, most dynamical model efforts
have assumed that dwarf spheroidal galaxies and their host halos are spherical. We use an Evans model
(1993) to construct an isothermal mock galaxy whose properties somewhat resemble those of the Sculptor
dwarf spheroidal galaxy. This mock galaxy contains flattened luminous and dark matter components,
resulting in a logarithmic profile for the global potential. We have tested how well our Schwarzschild
method could constrain the characteristic parameters of the system for different sample sizes,
and also if the functional form of the potential was unknown. When assuming the true functional form
of the potential, the Schwarzschild modelling technique is able to provide an accurate and precise
measurement of the characteristic mass parameter of the system and reproduces well the light distribution
and the stellar kinematics of our mock galaxy. When assuming a different functional form for the
potential, such as a flattened NFW profile, we also constrain the mass and scale radius to their expected
values. However in both cases, we find that the flattening parameter remains largely unconstrained.
This is likely because the information content of the velocity dispersion on the geometric shape
of the potential is too small, since $\sigma$ is constant across our mock dSph. Our results using
Schwarzschild's method indicate that the mass enclosed can be derived reliably, even if the flattening
parameter is unknown, and already for samples containing 2000 line-of-sight radial velocities,
such as those currently available. Further applications of the method to more general distribution
functions of flattened systems are needed to establish how well the flattening of dSph dark halos
can be determined.
