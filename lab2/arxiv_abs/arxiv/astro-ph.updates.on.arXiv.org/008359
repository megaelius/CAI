Solar observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) provide us with
direct measurements of the brightness temperature in the solar chromosphere. We study the temperature
distributions obtained with ALMA Band 6 (in four sub-bands at 1.21, 1.22, 1.29, and 1.3 mm) for various
areas at, and in the vicinity of, a sunspot, comprising quasi-quiet and active regions with different
amounts of underlying magnetic fields. We compare these temperatures with those obtained at near-
and far-ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths (and with the line-core intensities of the optically-thin
far-UV spectra), co-observed with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) explorer.
These include the emission peaks and cores of the Mg II k 279.6 nm and Mg II h 280.4 nm lines as well as
the line cores of C II 133.4 nm, O I 135.6 nm, and Si IV 139.4 nm, sampling the mid-to-high chromosphere
and the low transition region. Splitting the ALMA sub-bands resulted in an slight increase of spatial
resolution in individual temperature maps, thus, resolving smaller-scale structures compared
to those produced with the standard averaging routines. We find that the radiation temperatures
have different, though somewhat overlapping, distributions in different wavelengths and in the
various magnetic regions. Comparison of the ALMA temperatures with those of the UV diagnostics
should, however, be interpreted with great caution, the former is formed under the local thermodynamic
equilibrium (LTE) conditions, the latter under non-LTE. The mean radiation temperature of the
ALMA Band 6 is similar to that extracted from the IRIS C II line in all areas with exception of the sunspot
and pores where the C II poses higher radiation temperatures. In all magnetic regions, the Mg II lines
associate with the lowest mean radiation temperatures in our sample. These will provide constraints
for future numerical models.
