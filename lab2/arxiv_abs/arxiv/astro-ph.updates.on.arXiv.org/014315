Early science observations from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) have
revealed clear signals of diffuse radio emission associated with two clusters detected by the South
Pole Telescope via their Sunyaev Zel'dovich signal. SPT CLJ0553-3342 (MACSJ0553.4-3342) and
SPT CLJ0638-5358 (Abell S0592) are both high-mass lensing clusters that have undergone major mergers.
To improve the data products of these ASKAP early science observations and create science-fidelity
images of the galaxy clusters, we performed direction-dependent (DD) calibration and imaging
using state-of-the-art software {\sc killMS} and {\sc DDFacet}. We find that artefacts in the ASKAP
images are greatly reduced after directional calibration. Here we present our DD calibrated ASKAP
radio images of both clusters showing unambiguous giant radio halos with largest linear scales
of $\sim1$~Mpc. The halo in MACSJ0553.4-3342 was previously detected with GMRT observations at
323 MHz, but appears more extended in our ASKAP image. Although there is a shock detected in the thermal
X-ray emission of this cluster, we find that the particle number density in the shocked region is
too low to allow for the generation of a radio shock. The radio halo in Abell S0592 is a new discovery,
and the Southwest border of the halo coincides with a shock detected in X-rays. We discuss the origins
of these halos considering both the hadronic and turbulent re-acceleration models as well as sources
of \textit{seed} electrons. This work gives a positive indication of the potential of ASKAP's Evolutionary
Map of the Universe (EMU) survey in detecting intracluster medium radio sources, and showcases
the improvement in data products after utilising third-generation calibration techniques.
