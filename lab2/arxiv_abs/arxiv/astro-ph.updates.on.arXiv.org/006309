We present the detection analysis of a diffuse molecular cloud at z$_{abs}$=2.4636 towards the
quasar SDSS J1513+0352(z$_{em}\,\simeq$ 2.68) observed with the X-shooter spectrograph(VLT).
We measure very high column densities of atomic and molecular hydrogen, with log N(HI,H$_2$)$\simeq$21.8,21.3.
This is the highest H$_2$ column density ever measured in an intervening damped Lyman-alpha system
but we do not detect CO, implying log N(CO)/N(H$_2$) < -7.8, which could be due to a low metallicity
of the cloud. From the metal absorption lines, we derive the metallicity to be Z $\simeq$ 0.15 Z$_{\odot}$
and determine the amount of dust by measuring the induced extinction of the background quasar light,
A$_V$ $\simeq$ 0.4. We also detect Ly-$\alpha$ emission at the same redshift, with a centroid located
at a most probable impact parameter of only $\rho\,\simeq$ 1.4 kpc. We argue that the line of sight
is therefore likely passing through the ISM of a galaxy as opposed to the CGM. The relation between
the surface density of gas and that of star formation seems to follow the global empirical relation
derived in the nearby Universe although our constraints on the star formation rate and on the galaxy
extent remain too loose to be conclusive. We study the transition from atomic to molecular hydrogen
using a theoretical description based on the microphysics of molecular hydrogen. We use the derived
chemical properties of the cloud and physical conditions (T$_k\,\simeq$90 K and n$\simeq$250
cm$^{-3}$ derived through the excitation of H$_2$ rotational levels and neutral carbon fine structure
transitions to constrain the fundamental parameters that govern this transition. By comparing
the theoretical and observed HI column densities, we are able to bring an independent constraint
on the incident UV flux, which we find to be in agreement with that estimated from the observed star
formation rate.
