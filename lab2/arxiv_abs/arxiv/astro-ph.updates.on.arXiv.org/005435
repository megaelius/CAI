The observed convective flows on the photosphere (e.g., supergranulation, granulation) play
a key role in the Babcock-Leighton (BL) process to generate large-scale polar fields from sunspots
fields. In most surface flux transport (SFT) and BL dynamo models, the dispersal and migration of
surface fields is modeled as an effective turbulent diffusion. Recent SFT models have incorporated
explicit, realistic convective flows in order to improve the fidelity of convective transport
but, to our knowledge, this has not yet been implemented in previous BL models. Since most Flux-Transport
(FT)/BL models are axisymmetric, they do not have the capacity to include such flows. We present
the first kinematic 3D FT/BL model to explicitly incorporate realistic convective flows based
on solar observations. Though we describe a means to generalize these flows to 3D, we find that the
kinematic small-scale dynamo action they produce disrupts the operation of the cyclic dynamo.
Cyclic solution is found by limiting the convective flow to act only on the vertical radial component
of the magnetic field. The results obtained are generally in good agreement with the observed surface
flux evolution and with non-convective models that have a turbulent diffusivity on the order of
$3 \times 10^{12}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ (300 km$^2$ s$^{-1}$). However, we find that the use of a turbulent
diffusivity underestimates the dynamo efficiency, producing weaker mean fields and shorter cycle
than in the convective models. Also, the convective models exhibit mixed polarity bands in the polar
regions that have no counterpart in solar observations. Also, the explicitly computed turbulent
electromotive force (emf) bears little resemblance to a diffusive flux. We also find that the poleward
migration speed of poloidal flux is determined mainly by the meridional flow and the vertical diffusion.
