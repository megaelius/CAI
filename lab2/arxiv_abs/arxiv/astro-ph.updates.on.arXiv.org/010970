Extracting accurate cosmological information from galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-matter correlation
functions on non-linear scales ($\lesssim 10 h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}$) requires cosmological simulations.
Additionally, one has to marginalise over several nuisance parameters of the galaxy-halo connection.
However, the computational cost of such simulations prohibits naive implementations of stochastic
posterior sampling methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) that would require of order $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$
samples in cosmological parameter space. Several groups have proposed surrogate models as a solution:
a so-called emulator is trained to reproduce observables for a limited number of realisations in
parameter space. Afterwards, this emulator is used as a surrogate model in an MCMC analysis. Here,
we demonstrate a different method called Cosmological Evidence Modelling (CEM). First, for each
simulation, we calculate the Bayesian evidence marginalised over the galaxy-halo connection
by repeatedly populating the simulation with galaxies. We show that this Bayesian evidence is directly
related to the posterior probability of cosmological parameters. Finally, we build a physically
motivated model for how the evidence depends on cosmological parameters as sampled by the simulations.
We demonstrate the feasibility of CEM by using simulations from the Aemulus simulation suite and
forecasting cosmological constraints from BOSS CMASS measurements of redshift-space distortions.
Our analysis includes an exploration of how galaxy assembly bias affects cosmological inference.
Overall, CEM has several potential advantages over the more common approach of emulating summary
statistics, including the ability to easily marginalise over highly complex models of the galaxy-halo
connection and greater accuracy, thereby reducing the number of simulations required.
