Observations of 170 local (z<0.08) galaxy clusters have been obtained with the Wendelstein Telescope
Wide Field Imager. We correct for PSF broadening, foreground stars contamination, relative bias
offsets and charge persistence. Scattered light induced background inhomogeneities are reduced
down to a surface brightness (SB) of >31 g' mag arcsec$^{-2}$ by large dithering and subtraction
of night-sky flats. Residual background inhomogeneities brighter than SB<27.6 g' mag arcsec$^{-2}$
caused by galactic cirrus are detected in front of 23% of the clusters. Accretion signatures appear
in form of tidal streams in 22%, shells in 9.4%, multiple nuclei in 47% and two Brightest Cluster Galaxies
(BCGs) in 7% of the clusters/BCGs. We measure SB profiles of the BCGs and their surrounding Intracluster
Light (ICL) down to a limiting SB of 30 g' mag arcsec$^{-2}$. We find that 71% of the BCG+ICL systems
have SB profiles that are well described by a single S\'ersic (SS) function whereas 29% require a
double S\'ersic (DS) function to obtain a good fit. SS BCGs, having more symmetric isophotal shapes
and fewer detected accretion signatures than DS BCGs, appear to have slightly more relaxed morphology
than their DS counterparts. We argue that the outer S\'ersic component is unlikely to trace the dynamically
hot ICL. We find that BCGs have scaling relations that differ markedly from those of normal ellipticals,
likely due to their indistinguishable embedding in the ICL. The most extended BCG+ICL systems have
luminosities and radii comparable to whole clusters. On average, the ICL is better aligned than
the BCG with the host cluster in position angle and centering. That makes it a potential Dark Matter
tracer. We find positive correlations between BCG+ICL brightness and cluster mass, -radius, -richness
and integrated satellite brightness, confirming that BCG/ICL growth is indeed coupled with cluster
growth.
