RW Aur is a binary system composed of two young, low-mass stars. The primary, RW Aur A, has undergone
visual dimming events ($\Delta V =2-3$~mag) in 2011, 2014-16, and 2017-2018. Visual and IR observations
indicate a gray absorber that moved into the line-of-sight. This dimming is also associated with
changes in the outflow. In 2017, when the optical brightness was almost 2~mag below the long-term
average we triggered a Chandra observation to measure the absorbing column density $N_\mathrm{H}$
and to constrain dust properties and the gas-to-dust ratio of the absorber. In 2017, the X-ray spectrum
is more absorbed than it was in the optically bright state ($N_\mathrm{H} = (4\pm 1) \times 10^{23}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$)
and shows significantly more hot plasma than in X-ray observations taken before. Also, a new emission
feature at $6.63\pm0.02$ keV (statistic) $\pm0.02$ keV (systematic) appeared indicating an Fe
abundance an order of magnitude above Solar, in contrast with previous sub-Solar Fe abundance measurements.
Comparing X-ray absorbing column density $N_\mathrm{H}$ and optical extinction $A_V$, we find
that either the gas-to-dust ratio in the absorber is orders of magnitude higher than in the ISM or
the absorber has undergone significant dust evolution. Given the high column density coupled with
changes in the X-ray spectral shape, this absorber is probably located in the inner disk. We speculate
that a break-up of planetesimals or a terrestrial planet could supply large grains causing gray
absorption; some of these grains would be accreted and enrich the stellar corona with iron which
could explain the inferred high abundance.
