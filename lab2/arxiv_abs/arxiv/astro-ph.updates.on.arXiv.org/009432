We address the spatial scale, ionization structure and metal content of gas at the Milky Way disk-halo
interface detected as absorption in the foreground of seven halo blue horizontal branch stars (BHBs).
The closely-spaced, high-latitude BHB sightlines reach to different heights above the disk, ranging
from z = 3 - 14 kpc in the direction of the Northern Galactic Pole. With our high-resolution, S/N > 14,
HST/COS and Keck/HIRES spectra, we constrain the distances, velocities, sizes, and carbon content
of infalling, intermediate-velocity gaseous structures (IV gas; -90 < v_LSR [km s^-1] < -25 ). We
detect transitions that trace multiple ionization states (e.g. CaII, FeII, SiIV, CIV) with column
densities that remain constant with height from the disk, indicating that the gas most likely lies
within z < 3.4 kpc. The intermediate ionization state gas traced by CIV and SiIV is strongly correlated
over the full range of transverse separations probed by our sightlines, indicating large, coherent
structures greater than 500 pc in size. The low ionization state material traced by CaII and FeII
neither exhibits a correlation with N_HI nor transverse separation, implying cloudlets or clumpiness
on scales less than 10 pc. We find that the observed ratio log(N_SiIV/ N_CIV), with a median value
of -0.69+/-0.04, is sensitive to the total carbon content of the ionized gas under the assumption
of either photoionization or collisional ionization. Our data directly support a physical scenario
in which the Milky Way is fed by complex, multiphase processes at its disk-halo interface that involve
kpc-scale ionized envelopes or streams containing pc-scale, cool clumps. (Abridged)
