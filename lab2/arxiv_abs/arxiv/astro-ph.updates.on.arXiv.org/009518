The first detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from the binary neutron star (NS) inspiral GW170817
has opened a unique channel for probing the fundamental properties of matter at supra-nuclear densities
inaccessible elsewhere in the Universe. This observation yielded the first constraints on the
equation of state (EoS) of NS matter from the GW imprint of tidal interactions. Tidal signatures
in the GW arise from the response of a matter object to the spacetime curvature sourced by its binary
companion. They crucially depend on the EoS and are predominantly characterised by the tidal deformability
parameters $\Lambda_{\ell}$, where $\ell=2,3$ denotes the quadrupole and octupole respectively.
As the binary evolves towards merger, additional dynamical tidal effects become important when
the orbital frequency approaches a resonance with the stars' internal oscillation modes. Among
these modes, the fundamental ($f_\ell$-)modes have the strongest tidal coupling and can give rise
to a cumulative imprint in the GW signal even if the resonance is not fully excited. Here we present
the first direct constraints on fundamental oscillation mode frequencies for GW170817 using an
inspiral GW phase model with an explicit dependence on the $f$-mode frequency and without assuming
any relation between $f_\ell$ and $\Lambda_\ell$. We rule out anomalously small values of $f_\ell$
and, for the larger companion, determine a lower bound on the $f_2$-mode ($f_3$-mode) frequency
of $\geq 1.39$ kHz ($\geq 1.86$ kHz) at the 90\% credible interval (CI). We then show that networks
of future GW detectors will be able to measure $f$-mode frequencies to within tens of Hz from the inspiral
alone. Such precision astroseismology will enable novel tests of fundamental physics and the nature
of compact binaries.
