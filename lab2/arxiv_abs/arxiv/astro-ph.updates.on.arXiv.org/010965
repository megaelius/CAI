(abridged) The far-UV wavelength range (912-2000A) provides access to atomic and molecular transitions
of many species the interstellar medium (ISM), circumgalactic medium (CGM), and intergalactic
medium, within phases spanning a wide range of ionization, density, temperature, and molecular
gas fraction. Far-UV space telescopes have enabled detailed studies of the ISM in the Milky Way thanks
to absorption features appearing in the UV spectra of hot stars and yielding fundamental insights
into the composition and physical characteristics of all phases of the ISM along with the processes
that influence them. However, we have yet to design a spectrometer able to observe the full UV domain
at resolving power R>10^5 with a signal-to-noise ratio SNR>500. Such a resolution is necessary
to resolve lines from both the cold molecular hydrogen and the warm metal ions with a turbulent velocity
of about 1 km s-1, and to differentiate distinct velocity components. Future UV spectroscopic studies
of the Milky Way ISM must revolutionize our understanding of the ISM as a dynamical, unstable, and
magnetized medium, and rise to the challenge brought forward by current theories. Another interesting
prospect is to transpose the same level of details that has been reached for the Milky Way to the ISM
in external galaxies, in particular in metal-poor galaxies, where the ISM chemical composition,
physical conditions, and topology change dramatically, with significant consequences on the
star-formation properties. Finally, we need to be able to perform statistical analyses of background
quasar lines of sight intersecting the CGM of galaxies at various redshifts and to comprehend the
role of gas exchanges and flows for galaxy evolution.
