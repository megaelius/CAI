We examine X-ray scaling relations for massive halos ($M_{500}>10^{12.3}M_\odot$) in the Simba
galaxy formation simulation. The X-ray weighted luminosity, $L_X$ vs. $M_{500}$ has power-law
slopes $\approx\frac{5}{3}$ and $\approx\frac{8}{3}$ above and below $10^{13.5} M_{\odot}$,
deviating from the self-similarity increasingly to low masses. $T_X-M_{500}$ is self-similar
above this mass, and slightly shallower below it. Comparing Simba to observed $T_X$ scalings, we
find that $L_X$, $L_X$-weighted [Fe/H], and entropies at $0.1 R_{200}$ ($S_{0.1}$) and $R_{500}$
($S_{500}$) all match reasonably well. $S_{500}-T_X$ is consistent with self-similar expectations,
but $S_{0.1}-T_X$ is shallower at lower $T_X$, suggesting the dominant form of heating moves from
gravitational shocks in the outskirts to non-gravitational feedback in the cores of smaller groups.
Simba matches observations of $L_X$ versus central galaxy stellar mass $M_*$, predicting the additional
trend that star-forming galaxies have higher $L_X(M_*)$. The electron density profiles for $M_{500}>10^{14}M_\odot$
halos show a $\sim 0.1R_{200}$ core, but at lower masses the profiles are flat at all radii. $T_X$
profiles are flat for $M_{500}<10^{13}M_{\odot}$, and increasingly centrally peaked with mass.
The resulting entropy profiles are centrally depressed for the highest and lowest mass halos but
flatter for intermediate-mass halos, with $S_{\rm core}\approx200-400$ keV cm$^2$. Simba's
[Fe/H] profile matches observations in the core but over-predicts at larger radii, suggesting
overly widespread metal distribution. We show that Simba's bipolar jet AGN feedback is most responsible
for increasingly evacuating lower-mass halos, thereby suppressing core densities and raising
core entropies to improve agreement with X-ray scaling relations.
