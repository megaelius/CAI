The processes taking place in the outermost reaches of spiral disks (the 'proto-disk') are intimately
connected to the build-up of mass and angular momentum in galaxies. The thinness of spiral disks
suggests that the activity is mostly quiescent and presumably this region is fed by cool flows coming
into the halo from the intergalactic medium. While there is abundant evidence for the presence of
a circumgalactic medium (CGM) around disk galaxies as traced by quasar absorption lines, it has
been very difficult to connect this material to the outer gas disk. This has been a very difficult
transition region to explore because baryon tracers are hard to observe. In particular, HI disks
have been argued to truncate at a critical column density N(H) $\approx 3\times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$
at 30 kpc for an L* galaxy where the gas is vulnerable to the external ionizing background. But new
deep observations of nearby L* spirals (e.g. Milky Way, NGC 2997) suggest that HI disks may extend
much further than recognised to date, up to 60 kpc at N(H) $\approx 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$. Motivated
by these observations, here we show that a clumpy outer disk of dense clouds or cloudlets is potentially
detectable to much larger radii and lower HI column densities than previously discussed. This extended
proto-disk component is likely to explain some of the MgII forest seen in quasar spectra as judged
from absorption-line column densities and kinematics. We fully anticipate that the armada of new
radio facilities and planned HI surveys coming online will detect this extreme outer disk (scree)
material. We also propose a variant on the successful 'Dragonfly' technique to go after the very
weak H$\alpha$ signals expected in the proto-disk region.
