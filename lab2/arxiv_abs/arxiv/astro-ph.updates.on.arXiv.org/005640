One of the main challenges of current tidal disruption events (TDEs) studies is that emission arising
from AGN activity may potentially mimic the expected X-ray emission of a TDE. Here we compare the
X-ray properties of TDEs and AGN to determine a set of characteristics which would allow us to discriminate
between flares arising from these two objects. We find that at peak, TDEs are brighter than AGN found
at similar redshifts. However, compared to preflare upperlimits, highly variable AGN can produce
flares of a similar order of magnitude as those seen from X-ray TDEs. Nevertheless, TDEs decay significantly
more monotonically, and their emission exhibits little variation in spectral hardness as a function
of time. We also find that X-ray TDEs are less absorbed, and their emission is much softer than the
emission detected from AGN found at similar redshifts. We derive the X-ray luminosity function
(LF) for X-ray TDEs using the events from Auchettl et al. (2017). Interestingly, our X-ray LF matches
closely the theoretically derived LF by Milosavljevi\'c et al. (2006). which assumes a higher TDE
rate currently estimated from observations. Using our results and the results of Stone & Metzger
(2016), we estimate a TDE rate of $(0.7-4.7)\times10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$ per galaxy, higher than current
observational estimates. We find that TDEs can contribute significantly to the LF of AGN for $z\lesssim0.4$,
while there is no evidence that TDEs influence the growth of $10^{6-7}M_{\odot}$ BHs. However,
BHs $<10^{6}M_{\odot}$ can grow from TDEs arising from super-Eddington accretion without contributing
significantly to the observed AGN LF at $z=0$.
