Using a sample of $\simeq$144,000 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 14 we investigate
the outflow properties, evident both in absorption and emission, of high-ionization Broad Absorption
Line (BAL) and non-BAL quasars with redshifts 1.6 $\lesssim z \leq$ 3.5 and luminosities 45.3 $<
\log_{10}(L_{bol}) < $ 48.2 erg s$^{-1}$. Key to the investigation is a continuum and emission-line
reconstruction scheme, based on mean-field independent component analysis, that allows the kinematic
properties of the CIV$\lambda$1550 emission line to be compared directly for both non-BAL and BAL
quasars. CIV-emission blueshift and equivalent-width (EW) measurements are thus available for
both populations. Comparisons of the emission-line and BAL-trough properties reveal strong systematic
correlations between the emission and absorption properties. The dependence of quantitative
outflow indicators on physical properties such as quasar luminosity and luminosity relative to
Eddington-luminosity are also shown to be essentially identical for the BAL and non-BAL populations.
There is an absence of BALs in quasars with the hardest spectral energy distributions (SEDs), revealed
by the presence of strong HeII$\lambda$1640 emission, large CIV$\lambda$1550-emission EW and
no measurable blueshift. In the remainder of the CIV-emission blueshift versus EW space, BAL and
non-BAL quasars are present at all locations; for every BAL-quasar it is possible to identify non-BAL
quasars with the same emission-line outflow properties and SED-hardness. The co-location of BAL
and non-BAL quasars as a function of emission-line outflow and physical properties is the key result
of our investigation, demonstrating that (high-ionization) BALs and non-BALs represent different
views of the same underlying quasar population.
