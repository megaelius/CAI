We construct a sample of 70 clusters using data from XMM-Newton and Planck to investigate the $Y_{\rm
SZ,Planck}-Y_{\rm SZ, XMM}$ scaling relation and the cool-core influences on the relation. $Y_{\rm
SZ,XMM}$ is calculated by accurate de-projected temperature and electron number density profiles
derived from XMM-Newton. $Y_{\rm SZ,Planck}$ is the latest Planck data restricted to our precise
X-ray size $\theta_{\rm 500}$. To study the cool-core influences on$Y_{\rm SZ,Planck}-Y_{\rm
SZ, XMM}$ scaling relation, we apply two criteria, limits of central cooling time and classic mass
deposition rate, to distinguish cool-core clusters (CCCs) from non-cool-core clusters (NCCCs).
We also use $Y_{\rm SZ,Planck}$ from other papers, which are derived from different methods, to
confirm our results. The intercept and slope of the$Y_{\rm SZ,Planck}-Y_{\rm SZ, XMM}$ scaling
relation are $A=-0.86 \pm 0.30$, $B=0.83 \pm 0.06$. The intrinsic scatter is $\sigma_{\rm ins}=
0.14 \pm 0.03$. The ratio of \mbox{$Y_{\rm SZ,Planck}/Y_{\rm SZ, XMM}$} is $1.03 \pm 0.05$, which
is perfectly agreed with unity. Discrepancies of $Y_{\rm SZ,Planck}-Y_{\rm SZ, XMM}$ scaling
relation between CCCs and NCCCs are found in observation. They are independent of cool-core classification
criteria and $Y_{\rm SZ,Planck}$ calculation methods, although discrepancies are more significant
under the classification criteria of classic mass deposition rate. The intrinsic scatter of CCCs
(0.04) is quite small compared to that of NCCCs (0.27). The ratio of $Y_{\rm SZ,Planck}/Y_{\rm SZ,
XMM}$ for CCCs is $0.89 \pm 0.05$, suggesting that CCCs' $Y_{\rm SZ,XMM}$ may overestimate SZ signal.
By contrast, the ratio of $Y_{\rm SZ,Planck}/Y_{\rm SZ, XMM}$ for NCCCs is $1.14 \pm 0.12$, which
indicates that NCCCs' $Y_{\rm SZ,XMM}$ may underestimate SZ signal.
