The diffuse, atomic interstellar medium is observed to be full of thin, linear structures, usually
referred to as "fibers". Fibers exhibit similar properties to linear structures found in molecular
clouds, termed striations. Suggestive of a similar formation mechanism, both striations and fibers
appear to be ordered, well-aligned with the magnetic field and exhibit quasi-periodicity. The
prevailing formation mechanism for striations involves the excitation of fast magnetosonic waves.
Based on the theory of fast magnetosonic waves, and through a combination of velocity centroids
and column density maps, Tritsis et al. (2018) developed a method for estimating the plane-of-sky
(POS) magnetic field from molecular cloud striations. Here we apply this method in two H\textsc{I}
clouds with fibers along the same line-of-sight (LOS) towards the ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray
hotspot, at the boundaries of Ursa Major. For the cloud located closer to Earth, where Zeeman observations
from the literature were also available, we find general agreement in the distributions of the LOS
and POS components of the magnetic field. We find relatively large values for the total magnetic
field (ranging from $\sim$$\rm{10}$ to $\sim$$\rm{20} ~\rm{\mu G}$) and an average projection
angle with respect to the LOS of $\sim$ 50$^\circ$. For the cloud located further away, we also find
a large value for the POS component of the magnetic field of $15^{+8}_{-3}~\rm{\mu G}$. We discuss
the potential of our new magnetic-field tomography method for large-scale application. We also
consider the implications of our findings in this specific direction on the accuracy of current
reconstructions of the Galactic magnetic field and on the propagation of the highest-energy cosmic
rays through the interstellar medium.
