There is growing evidence that a clear distinction between magnetars and radio pulsars may not exist,
implying the population of neutron stars that exhibit both radio pulsations and bursting activities
could be potentially large. In this situation, new insights into the burst mechanism could be gained
by combining the temporal behavior of radio pulsations. We present a general model for radio suppression
by relativistic $e^{\pm}$ plasma outflows at the onset of magnetar flares. A sudden ejection of
magnetic energy into the magnetosphere would generate a fireball plasma, which is promptly driven
to expand at relativistic speed. This would make the plasma cutoff frequency significantly higher
than the rest frame radio frequency, resulting in the suppression of radio waves. We analytically
show that any GHz radio emission arising from the magnetosphere is suppressed for $\sim100\ {\rm
s}$, depending on the total fireball energy. On the other hand, thermal radiation is expected from
the hot spot(s) on the stellar surface created by an inflow of dense plasma, which could be the origin
of short bursts. Since our hypothesis predicts radio suppression in coincidence with short bursts,
this could be an indirect method to constrain the occurrence rate of short bursts at the faint end
that remain undetected by X-ray detectors. Furthermore, ultra-fast gamma-ray flashes from the
fireball photosphere is also expected as a smoking gun, although the onboard detection is challenging
due to its extremely short duration $\sim\mu$s. Finally, our model is applied to the radio pulsar
with magnetar-like activities, PSR J1119-6127 in light of recent observations. Implications
for fast radio bursts and the possibility of plasma lensing are also discussed.
