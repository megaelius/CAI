SMC X-1 is an X-ray pulsar showing a superorbital modulation with an unstable cycle length in X-ray
band. We present its timing behaviors, including the spin, orbital, and superorbital modulations,
beyond the end of the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer mission. The time-frequency maps derived by the
wavelet Z-transform and the Hilbert-Huang transform suggest a new superorbital period excursion
event occurred in ~MJD 57100 (Mar. 2015). This indicates the excursion is recurrent and probably
(quasi-)periodic. The hardness ratio obtained with the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) suggests
increased absorption during the transition from high- to low-state in the superorbital cycle.
Compared to the regular epochs, the superorbital profile during the excursion epochs has a shallower
and narrower valley, likely caused by a flatter warp. By tracking the spin period evolution with
MAXI GSC in 2-20 keV, we derive an averaged spin-up rate as $\dot{\nu}=2.515(3)\times10^{-11}$
s$^{-2}$ during the period between MJD 55141 (Nov. 2009) and 58526 (Feb. 2019). We obtain no positive
correlation between the spin frequency residual and the superorbital frequency but a torque change
accompanies with the superorbital period excursion is possible. We suggest the accretion torque
on the neutron star could be changed by various mechanisms, including the change of mass accretion
rate and the warp angle. We update the value of the orbital decay as $\dot{P}_{\rm{orb}}/P_{\rm{orb}}=-3.380(6)\times10^{-6}$
yr$^{-1}$. Finally, we reconfirm the detection of the superorbital modulation in the optical band
and its coherence in phase with the X-ray modulation.
