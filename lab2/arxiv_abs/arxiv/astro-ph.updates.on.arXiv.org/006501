We present a catalogue of 73,221 white dwarf candidates extracted from the astrometric and photometric
data of the recently published Gaia DR2 catalogue. White dwarfs were selected from the Gaia Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram with the aid of the most updated population synthesis simulator. Our analysis shows that
Gaia has virtually identified all white dwarfs within 100 pc from the Sun. Hence, our sub-population
of 8,555 white dwarfs within this distance limit and the colour range considered, $-\,0.52<(G_{\rm
BP}-G_{\rm RP})<0.80$, is the largest and most complete volume-limited sample of such objects
to date. From this sub-sample we identified 8,343 CO-core and 212 ONe-core white dwarf candidates
and derived a white dwarf space density of $4.9\pm0.4\times10^{-3}\,{\rm pc^{-3}}$. A bifurcation
in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for these sources, which our models do not predict, is clearly
visible. We used the Virtual Observatory tool VOSA to derive effective temperatures and luminosities
for our sources by fitting their spectral energy distributions, that we built from the UV to the NIR
using publicly available photometry through the Virtual Observatory. From these parameters,
we derived the white dwarf radii. Interpolating the radii and effective temperatures in hydrogen-rich
white dwarf cooling sequences, we derived the surface gravities and masses. The Gaia 100 pc white
dwarf population is clearly dominated by cool ($\sim$ 8,000 K) objects and reveals a significant
population of massive ($M \sim 0.8 M_{\odot}$) white dwarfs, of which no more than $\sim$ $30-40
\%$ can be attributed to hydrogen-deficient atmospheres, and whose origin remains uncertain.
