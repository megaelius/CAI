Mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at TeV energies and has been extensively studied since its
first VHE detection in 1996. Our goal is to characterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission,
together with the radio-to-X-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is less
often studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. We organized a multiwavelength (MW)
campaign on Mrk 501 between March and May 2008. This multi-instrument effort included the most sensitive
VHE gamma-ray instruments in the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov
telescopes MAGIC and VERITAS, as well as Swift, RXTE, the F-GAMMA, GASP-WEBT, and other collaborations
and instruments. Mrk 501 was found to be in a low state of activity during the campaign, with a VHE flux
in the range of 10%-20% of the Crab nebula flux. Nevertheless, significant flux variations were
detected with various instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. The broadband
spectral energy distribution during the two different emission states of the campaign can be adequately
described within the homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model, with the (slightly)
higher state described by an increase in the electron number density. This agrees with previous
studies of the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states. We report
for the first time a tentative X-ray-to-VHE correlation during a low VHE activity. Although marginally
significant, this positive correlation between X-ray and VHE, which has been reported many times
during flaring activity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the X-ray/VHE emission during
non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that are responsible for the
emission during flaring activity.
