The nature of dark matter remains one of the biggest open questions in physics. Intriguingly, it
has been suggested that dark matter may be explained by another recently observed phenomenon: the
detection of gravitational waves by LIGO. LIGO's detection of gravitational waves from merging
stellar mass black holes renewed attention toward the possibility that dark matter consists solely
of black holes created in the very early universe and that these primordial black holes are what LIGO
is presently observing. Subsequent work on this topic has ruled out the possibility that dark matter
could consist solely of black holes similar to those that LIGO has detected with masses above 10 solar
masses. However, LIGO's connection to dark matter remains an open question and in this work we consider
a distribution of primordial black holes that accounts for all of the dark matter, is consistent
with LIGO's observations arising from primordial black hole binaries, and resolves tension in
previous surveys of microlensing events in the Milky Way halo. The primordial black hole mass distribution
that we consider offers an important prediction--LIGO may detect black holes smaller than have
ever been observed with ~1% of the black holes it detects having a mass less than the mass of our Sun.
Approximately one year of operating advanced LIGO at design sensitivity should be adequate to begin
to see a hint of a primordial black hole mass distribution. Detecting primordial black hole binaries
below a solar mass will be readily distinguishable from other known compact binary systems, thereby
providing an unambiguous observational window for advanced LIGO to pin down the nature of dark matter.
