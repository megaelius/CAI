We use 2D particle-in-cell simulations to study the effect of the saturated whistler instability
on the viscous heating and nonthermal acceleration of electrons in a shearing, collisionless plasma
with a growing magnetic field, $\vec{B}$. If $|\vec{B}|$ grows, an electron pressure anisotropy
with $p_{\perp,e} > p_{||,e}$ naturally arises due to the adiabatic invariance of the electron
magnetic moment ($p_{||,e}$ and $p_{\perp,e}$ are the electron pressure parallel and perpendicular
to $\vec{B}$). If this anisotropy is large enough, the whistler instability is triggered, producing
efficient electron pitch-angle scattering, which regulates the extent to which the anisotropy
can grow. In this context, the pressure anisotropy taps into the velocity shear of the plasma, giving
rise to electron heating by the so called anisotropic viscosity. In our simulations, we permanently
drive the growth of $|\vec{B}|$ by externally imposing a shear motion in the plasma, allowing us
to self-consistently capture the long-term, saturated stage of the whistler instability. We find
that besides the overall viscous heating, the whistler mode scattering can stochastically accelerate
electrons to nonthermal energies. The acceleration is most prominent when initially $\beta_e\sim
1$, gradually decreasing its efficiency for larger values of $\beta_e$ ($\equiv 8\pi p_e/|\vec{B}|^2$).
If initially $\beta_e \sim 1$, the final electron energy distribution (measured when $\beta_e\sim
0.1$, due to the field amplification) can be fairly well described by a thermal component, plus a
power-law tail with spectral index $\sim 3.7$. In these cases, the nonthermal tail accounts for
$\sim 5\%$ of the electrons, and for $\sim 15\%$ of their kinetic energy. We discuss the implications
of our results for electron heating and acceleration in low-collisionality astrophysical environments,
such as low-luminosity accretion flows.
