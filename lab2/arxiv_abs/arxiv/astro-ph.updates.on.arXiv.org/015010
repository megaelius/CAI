Negotiations began 1n 1968 for a telescope facility at Perth Observatory for NASA's International
Planetary Patrol Network. 1,000 days later the telescope saw first light. The facility bears no
resemblance to other observatories. Inside a dome, the telescope sits on a 42 ft tall concrete pier
with a wrap-around staircase and concrete legs. Surrounding forest is similar in height to the dome,
the design of which is counter intuitive. This study investigated why, at the risk of compromising
performance, there was a departure from standard design, and to to identify drivers for the decision
making. Observatory visitors learn of a government architect, Tadeusz Andrzejaczek who made whimsical,
successive increases to the height of the structure. Though designed in collaboration with Acting
Government Astronomer, Bertrand Harris, it is improbable that a public servant architect would
have such influence over a scientific installation. Vibration amelioration was met by designing
massive strength and rigidity into the structure. Thermal expansion and wind stresses were reduced
using features such as shade fins and protective walls, and ground thermal disturbance was addressed
by simply making it tall. Seeing measurements were not a significant design consideration. The
facility exists with its current floor height because of successive approvals for modification.
The initial design was by Harris and requests for redesigns came from him but in close negotiation
the Andrzejaczek who desired a structure of futuristic shape and proportions. Harris's designs
were influenced by his personal English background and the Old Perth Observatory where he worked
as an astronomer. Andrzejaczek's design was influenced by an observatory in his birth city, his
alignment with contemporary designers and his artistic flair.
