We present the analysis of the first NuSTAR observations ($\sim 220$ ks), simultaneous with the
last SUZAKU observations ($\sim 50$ ks), of the active galactic nucleus of the bright Seyfert 1 galaxy
Mrk 509. The time-averaged spectrum in the $1-79$ keV X-ray band is dominated by a power-law continuum
($\Gamma\sim 1.8-1.9$), a strong soft excess around 1 keV, and signatures of X-ray reflection in
the form of Fe K emission ($\sim 6.4$ keV), an Fe K absorption edge ($\sim 7.1$ keV), and a Compton hump
due to electron scattering ($\sim 20-30$ keV). We show that these data can be described by two very
different prescriptions for the soft excess: a warm ($kT\sim 0.5-1$ keV) and optically thick ($\tau\sim10-20$)
Comptonizing corona, or a relativistically blurred ionized reflection spectrum from the inner
regions of the accretion disk. While these two scenarios cannot be distinguished based on their
fit statistics, we argue that the parameters required by the warm corona model are physically incompatible
with the conditions of standard coronae. Detailed photoionization calculations show that even
in the most favorable conditions, the warm corona should produce strong absorption in the observed
spectrum. On the other hand, while the relativistic reflection model provides a satisfactory description
of the data, it also requires extreme parameters, such as maximum black hole spin, a very low and compact
hot corona, and a very high density for the inner accretion disk. Deeper observations of this source
are thus necessary to confirm the presence of relativistic reflection, and to further understand
the nature of its soft excess.
