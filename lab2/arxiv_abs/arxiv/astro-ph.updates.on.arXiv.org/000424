We analyse the distribution of CO brightness temperature and integrated intensity in M51 at ~40
pc resolution using new CO data from the Plateau de Bure Arcsecond Whirlpool Survey (PAWS). We present
probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the CO emission within the PAWS field, which covers
the inner 11 x 7 kpc of M51. We find variations in the shape of CO PDFs within different M51 environments,
and between M51 and M33 and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Globally, the PDFs for the inner disk
of M51 can be represented by narrow lognormal functions that cover 1 to 2 orders of magnitude in CO
brightness and integrated intensity. The PDFs for M33 and the LMC are narrower and peak at lower CO
intensities. However, the CO PDFs for different dynamical environments within the PAWS field depart
from the shape of the global distribution. The PDFs for the interarm region are approximately lognormal,
but in the spiral arms and central region of M51, they exhibit diverse shapes with a significant excess
of bright CO emission. The observed environmental dependence of the shape of the CO PDFs is qualitatively
consistent with changes that would be expected if molecular gas in the spiral arms has a larger range
of average densities, gas temperatures and velocity fluctuations, though further work is required
to disentangle the importance of large-scale dynamical effects versus star formation feedback
in regulating these properties. We show that the shape of the CO PDFs for different M51 environments
is only weakly related to global properties of the CO emission, but is strongly correlated with some
properties of the local giant molecular cloud (GMC) and young stellar cluster populations. For
galaxies with strong spiral structure such as M51, our results indicate that galactic-scale dynamical
processes play a significant role in the formation and evolution of GMCs and stellar clusters.(abridged)
