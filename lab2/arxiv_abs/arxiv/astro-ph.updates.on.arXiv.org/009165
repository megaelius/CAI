The reduced speed of light approximation is used in a variety of simulations of the epoch of reionization
and galaxy formation. Its popularity stems from its ability to drastically reduce the computing
cost of a simulation, by allowing the use of larger, and therefore fewer timesteps to reach a solution.
It is physically motivated by the fact that ionization fronts rarely propagate faster than some
fraction of the speed of light. However, no global proof of the physical validity of this approach
is available, and possible artefacts resulting from this approximation therefore need to be identifited
and characterized to allow its proper use. In this paper we investigate the impact of the reduced
speed of light approximation on the predicted properties of the intergalactic medium. To this end
we use fully coupled radiation-hydrodynamics RAMSES-CUDATON simulations of the epoch of reionization.
We find that reducing the speed of light by a factor 5 (20, 100) leads to overestimating the post-reionization
volume-weighted $x_{HI}$ by a similar factor ~5 (20, 100) with respect to full speed of light simulations.
We show that the error is driven by the hydrogen - photon chemistry. In photo-ionization equilibrium,
reducing the speed of light has the same effect as artificially reducing the photon density or the
reaction cross-section and leads to an underestimated ionizing flux. We confirm this interpretation
by running additional simulations using a reduced speed of light in the photon propagation module,
but keeping this time the true speed of light in the chemistry module. With this setup, the post-reionization
neutral hydrogen fractions converge to the true value, which validates our explanation. Our resolution
study suggests that increasing spatial resolution may yield lower ionizing halo escape fractions,
which in turn would result in higher post-overlap volume-averaged neutral fractions.
