Context. HD13724 is a nearby solar-type star at 43.48 $\pm$ 0.06 pc hosting a long-period low-mass
brown dwarf detected with the CORALIE echelle spectrograph as part of the historical CORALIE radial-velocity
search for extra-solar planets. The companion has a minimum mass of $26.77^{+4.4}_{-2.2} M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$
and an expected semi-major axis of $\sim$ 240 mas making it a suitable target for further characterisation
with high-contrast imaging, in particular to measure its inclination, mass, and spectrum and thus
establish its substellar nature. Aims. Using high-contrast imaging with the SPHERE instrument
on the Very Large Telescope (VLT), we are able to directly image a brown dwarf companion to HD13724
and obtain a low-resolution spectrum. Methods. We combine the radial-velocity measurements of
CORALIE and HARPS taken over two decades and high contrast imaging from SPHERE to obtain a dynamical
mass estimate. From the SPHERE data we obtain a low resolution spectrum of the companion from Y to
J band, as well as photometric measurements from IRDIS in the J, H and K bands. Results. Using high-contrast
imaging with the SPHERE instrument at the VLT, we report the first images of a brown dwarf companion
to the host star HD13724. It has an angular separation of 175.6 $\pm$ 4.5 mas and H-band contrast of
$10.61\pm0.16$ mag and, using the age estimate of the star to be $\sim$1 Gyr, gives an isochronal
mass estimate of $\sim$44 $M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$. By combining radial-velocity and imaging data
we also obtain a dynamical mass of $50.5^{+3.3}_{-3.5} M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$. Through fitting an
atmospheric model, we estimate a surface gravity of $\log g = 5.5$ and an effective temperature of
1000K. A comparison of its spectrum with observed T dwarfs estimates a spectral type of T4 or T4.5,
with a T4 object providing the best fit.
