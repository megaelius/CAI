We explore the connection between dust and star formation, in the context of environmental effects
on galaxy evolution. In particular, we exploit the susceptibility of dust to external processes
to assess the influence of dense environment on star-forming galaxies. We have selected cluster
Abell 1758 from the Local Cluster Substructure Survey (LoCuSS). Its complex dynamical state is
an ideal test-bench to track dust removal and destruction in galaxies due to merger and accretion
shocks. We present a systematic panchromatic study (from 0.15 $\rm \mu$m with GALEX to 500 $\rm \mu$m
with Herschel) of spectroscopically confirmed star-forming cluster galaxies at intermediate
redshift. We observe that the main subclusters (A1758N and A1758S) belong to two separate large-scale
structures, with no overlapping galaxy members. Star-forming cluster members are distributed
preferentially outside cluster central regions, and are not grouped in substructures. Rather,
these galaxies are being funneled towards the main subclusters along separate accretion filaments.
Additionally, we present the first study of dust-to-stellar (DTS) mass ratio used as indicator
for local environmental influence on galaxy evolution. Star-forming cluster members show lower
mean values (32% at 2.4$\rm \sigma$) of DTS mass ratio and lower levels of infrared emission from
birth clouds with respect to coeval star-forming field galaxies. This picture is consistent with
the majority of star-forming cluster members infalling in isolation. Upon accretion, star-formation
is observed to decrease and warm dust is destroyed due to heating from the intracluster medium radiation,
ram-pressure stripping and merger shocks.
