Context. Over the past decades, several interplanetary missions have studied small bodies in situ,
leading to major advances in our understanding of their geological and geophysical properties.
These missions, however, have had a limited number of targets. Among them, the NASA Dawn mission
has characterised in detail the topography and albedo variegation across the surface of asteroid
(4) Vesta down to a spatial resolution of approximately 20 m/pixel scale. Aims. Here our aim was to
determine how much topographic and albedo information can be retrieved from the ground with VLT/SPHERE
in the case of Vesta, having a former space mission (Dawn) providing us with the ground truth that
can be used as a benchmark. Methods. We observed Vesta with VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL as part of our ESO large
programme (ID 199.C-0074) at six different epochs, and deconvolved the collected images with a
parametric point spread function (PSF). We then compared our images with synthetic views of Vesta
generated from the 3D shape model of the Dawn mission, on which we projected Vesta's albedo information.
Results. We show that the deconvolution of the VLT/SPHERE images with a parametric PSF allows the
retrieval of the main topographic and albedo features present across the surface of Vesta down to
a spatial resolution of approximately 20-30 km. Contour extraction shows an accuracy of approximately
1 pixel (3.6 mas). The present study provides the very first quantitative estimate of the accuracy
of ground-based adaptive-optics imaging observations of asteroid surfaces. Conclusions. In
the case of Vesta, the upcoming generation of 30-40m telescopes (ELT, TMT, GMT) should in principle
be able to resolve all of the main features present across its surface, including the troughs and
the north-south crater dichotomy, provided that they operate at the diffraction limit.
