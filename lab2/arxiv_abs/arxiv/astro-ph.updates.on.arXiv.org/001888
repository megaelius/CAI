The scientific mission of ESTCube-1, launched in May 2013, is to measure the Electric solar wind
sail (E-sail) force in orbit. The experiment is planned to push forward the development of E-sail,
a propulsion method recently invented at the Finnish Meteorological Institute. E-sail is based
on extracting momentum from the solar wind plasma flow by using long thin electrically charged tethers.
ESTCube-1 is equipped with one such tether, together with hardware capable of deploying and charging
it. At the orbital altitude of ESTCube-1 (660--680~km) there is no solar wind present. Instead,
ESTCube-1 shall observe the interaction between the charged tether and the ionospheric plasma.
The ESTCube-1 payload uses a 10-meter, partly two-filament E-sail tether and a motorized reel on
which it is stored. The tether shall be deployed from a spinning satellite with the help of centrifugal
force. An additional mass is added at the tip of the tether to assist with the deployment. During E-sail
experiment the tether shall be charged to 500~V potential. Both positive and negative voltages
shall be experimented with. The voltage is provided by a dedicated high voltage source and delivered
to the tether through a slip ring contact. When the negative voltage is applied to the tether, the
satellite body is expected to attract electron flow capable of compensating for the ion flow, which
runs to the tether from the surrounding plasma. With the positive voltage applied, onboard cold
cathode electron guns are used to remove excess electrons to maintain the positive voltage of the
tether. In this paper we present the design and structure of the tether payload of ESTCube-1.
