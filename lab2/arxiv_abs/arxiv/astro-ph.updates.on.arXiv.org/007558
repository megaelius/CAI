Multi-messenger astrophysics is undergoing a transition towards low-latency searches based
on signals that could not individually be established as discoveries. The rapid identification
of signals is important in order to initiate timely follow-up observations of transient emission
that is only detectable for short time periods. Joint searches for gravitational waves and high-energy
neutrinos represent a prime motivation for this strategy. Both gravitational waves and high-energy
neutrinos are typically emitted over a short time frame of seconds to minutes during the formation
or evolution of compact objects. In addition, detectors searching for both messengers observe
the whole sky continuously, making observational information on potential transient sources
rapidly available to guide follow-up electromagnetic surveys. The direction of high-energy neutrinos
can be reconstructed to sub-degree precision, making a joint detection much better localized than
a typical gravitational wave signal. Here we present a search strategy for joint gravitational
wave and high-energy neutrino events that allows the incorporation of astrophysical priors and
detector characteristics following a Bayesian approach. We aim to determine whether a multi-messenger
correlated signal is a real event, a chance coincidence of two background events or the chance coincidence
of an astrophysical signal and a background event. We use an astrophysical prior that is model agnostic
and takes into account mostly geometric factors. Our detector characterization in the search is
mainly empirical, enabling detailed realistic accounting for the sensitivity of the detector
that can depend on the source properties. By this means, we will calculate the false alarm rate for
each multi-messenger event which is required for initiating electromagnetic follow-up campaigns.
