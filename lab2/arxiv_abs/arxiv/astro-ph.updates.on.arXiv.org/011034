We compare the molecular and ionized gas kinematics of two strongly lensed galaxies at $z\sim1$
based on observations from ALMA and MUSE. We derive the CO and [OII] rotation curves and dispersion
profiles of these two galaxies. We find a difference between the observed molecular and ionized
gas rotation curves for one of the galaxies, the Cosmic Snake, for which we obtain a spatial resolution
of few hundred parsecs along the major axis. The rotation curve of the molecular gas is steeper than
the rotation curve of the ionized gas. In the second galaxy, A521, the molecular and ionized gas rotation
curves are consistent, but the spatial resolution is only of few kpc on the major axis. Using simulations,
we investigate the effect of the thickness of the gas disk and effective radius on the observed rotation
curves and find that a more extended and thicker disk smooths the curve. We also find that the presence
of a strongly inclined thick disk (>1 kpc) can smooth the rotation curve because it degrades the spatial
resolution along the line of sight. By building a model using a stellar disk and two gas disks, we reproduce
the rotation curves of the Cosmic Snake with a molecular gas disk that is more massive and more radially
and vertically concentrated than the ionized gas disk. Finally, we also obtain an intrinsic velocity
dispersion in the Cosmic Snake of 18.5+-7 km/s and 19.5+-6 km/s for the molecular and ionized gas,
respectively, which is consistent with a molecular disk with a smaller and thinner disk. For A521,
the intrinsic velocity dispersion values are 11+-8 km/s and 54+-11 km/s, with a higher value for
the ionized gas. This could indicate that the ionized gas disk is thicker and more turbulent in this
galaxy. These results highlight the different spatial distribution of the molecular and ionized
gas disks at $z\sim1$ and suggest the presence of thick ionized gas disks at this epoch.
