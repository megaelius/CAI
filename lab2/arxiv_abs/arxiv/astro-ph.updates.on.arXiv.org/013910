We present initial results from the Cosmic Ultraviolet Baryon Survey (CUBS). CUBS is designed to
map diffuse baryonic structures at redshift z<~1 using absorption-line spectroscopy of 15 UV-bright
QSOs with matching deep galaxy survey data. CUBS QSOs are selected based on their NUV brightness
to avoid biases against the presence of intervening Lyman Limit Systems (LLSs) at zabs<1. We report
five new LLSs of log N(HI)/cm^-2 >~ 17.2 over a total redshift survey pathlength of dz=9.3, and a number
density of n(z)=0.43 (-0.18, +0.26). Considering all absorbers with log N(HI)/cm^-2 > 16.5 leads
to n(z)=1.08 (-0.25, +0.31) at z<1. All LLSs exhibit a multi-component structure and associated
heavy ions from multiple ionization states such as CII, CIII, MgII, SiII, SiIII, OVI absorption.
Differential chemical enrichment levels as well as ionization states are directly observed across
individual components in three LLSs. We present deep galaxy survey data obtained using the VLT-MUSE
integral field spectrograph and the Magellan Telescopes, reaching sensitivities necessary for
detecting galaxies fainter than 0.1L* at d<~300 physical kpc (pkpc) in all five fields. A diverse
range of galaxy properties are seen around these LLSs, from a low-mass dwarf galaxy pair, a co-rotating
gaseous halo/disk, a star-forming galaxy, a massive quiescent galaxy, to a galaxy group. The closest
galaxies have projected distances ranging from d=15 to 72 pkpc and intrinsic luminosities from
~0.01L* to ~3L*. Our study shows that LLSs originate in a variety of galaxy environments and trace
gaseous structures with a broad range of metallicities.
