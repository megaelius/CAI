A knowledge of the particle escape time from the acceleration regions of many space and astrophysical
sources is of critical importance in the analysis of emission signatures produced by these particles
and in the determination of the acceleration and transport mechanisms at work. This paper addresses
this general problem, in particular in solar flares, where in addition to scattering by turbulence,
the magnetic field convergence from the acceleration region towards its boundaries also influences
the particle escape. We test an (approximate) analytic relation between escape and scattering
times, and the field convergence rate, based on the work of Malyshkin and Kulsrud (2001), valid for
both strong and weak diffusion limits and isotropic pitch angle distribution of the injected particles,
with a numerical model of particle transport. To this end, a kinetic Fokker-Planck transport model
of particles is solved with a stochastic differential equation scheme assuming different initial
pitch angle distributions. This approach enables further insights into the phase-space dynamics
of the transport process, which would otherwise not be accessible. We find that in general the numerical
results agree well with the analytic equation for the isotropic case, however, there are significant
differences weak diffusion regime for non-isotopic cases, especially for distributions beamed
along the magnetic field lines. The results are important in the interpretation of observations
of energetic particles in solar flares, and other similar space and astrophysical acceleration
sites and for the determination of acceleration-transport coefficients, commonly used in Fokker-Planck
type kinetic equations.
