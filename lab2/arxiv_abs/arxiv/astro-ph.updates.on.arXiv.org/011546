Lead (Pb) is predominantly produced by the slow neutron-capture process (s process) in asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) stars. In contrast to significantly enhanced Pb abundances predicted by low-mass,
low-metallicity AGB-models, observations of Magellanic post-AGB stars show incompatibly low
Pb abundances. Observations of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars whose s-process enrichments
are accompanied by heavy elements traditionally associated with the rapid neutron-capture process
(r process) have raised the need for a neutron-capture process operating at neutron densities intermediate
to the s and r process: the so-called i process. We study i-process nucleosynthesis with single-zone
nuclear-network calculations. Our i-process models can explain the heavy-element abundance
patterns measured in Magellanic post-AGB stars including their puzzlingly low Pb abundances.
Furthermore, the heavy-element enhancements in the post-AGB and CEMP-i stars, particularly their
Pb abundance, allow us to characterise the neutron densities and exposures of the i process that
produced the observed abundance patterns. We find that the lower-metallicity CEMP-i stars ($\left[
\mathrm{Fe} / \mathrm{H} \right] \approx -2.5$) have heavy-element abundances best matched by
models with higher neutron densities and exposures ($\tau > 2.0 \, \mathrm{mbarn}^{-1}$) compared
to the higher-metallicity post-AGB stars ($\left[ \mathrm{Fe} / \mathrm{H} \right] \approx -1.3$,
$\tau < 1.3 \, \mathrm{mbarn}^{-1}$). This offers new constraints and insights regarding the properties
of i-process sites and demonstrates that the responsible process operates on time scales of the
order of a few years or less.
