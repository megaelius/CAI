Gamma-ray blazars have been suggested as promising contributors to the diffuse flux of high-energy
neutrinos detected by IceCube. After the identification of the gamma-ray blazar TXS 0506+056 as
the first compelling IceCube neutrino source candidate, a systematic analysis of all high-energy
neutrino events satisfying the IceCube realtime trigger criteria was performed. One additional
known gamma-ray source, the blazar GB6 J1040+0617, was found to be in spatial coincidence with a
neutrino in this sample. The chance probability of this coincidence is 30$\%$ after trials correction.
For the first time, we present a systematic study of the gamma-ray flux, spectral and optical variability
and multi-wavelength behavior of GB6 J1040+0617 and compare it to TXS 0506+056. We discuss a possible
source confusion with a new emerging gamma-ray source, the blazar 4C+06.41. We find that TXS 0506+056
shows strong flux variability in the $\textit{Fermi}$-LAT gamma-ray band, being in an active state
around the arrival of IceCube-170922A, but in a low state during the archival IceCube neutrino flare
in 2014/15. In both cases the spectral shape is statistically compatible ($\leq 2\sigma$) with
the average spectrum. Assuming the reported redshift estimate of z=0.73, GB6 J1040+0617 has an
average gamma-ray luminosity comparable with that of TXS 0506+056. It shows a bright optical flare
recorded by ASAS-SN accompanied by modest gamma-ray activity at the neutrino arrival time. While
the association with the neutrino is consistent with background expectations, GB6 J1040+0617
appears to be a plausible neutrino source candidate based on its energetics and multi-wavelength
features. Finding one or two neutrinos originating from gamma-ray blazars in the given sample of
high-energy neutrinos is consistent with previously derived limits of neutrino emission from
gamma-ray blazars.
