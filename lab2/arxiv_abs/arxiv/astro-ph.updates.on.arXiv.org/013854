We investigate the shape of the Rotation Curves (RCs) of $z\sim 1$ star-forming galaxies and compare
them with the local star-forming galaxies. For this purpose, we have used $409$ galaxies from the
K-band Multi-Object Spectrograph (KMOS) for Redshift One Spectroscopic Survey (KROSS). This
sample covers the redshift range $0.57\leq z \leq 1.04$, effective radii $0.69 \leq R_e \left[kpc
\right] \leq 7.73$, absolute H-band magnitude $-24.46 \leq M_H \leq -18.85$ with median stellar
mass $log\left(M_* \ \left[M_\odot \right]\right)=9.95$ and median total star-formation rate
$log\left(SFR_{tot} \ \left[M_\odot \ yr^{-1} \right]\right)=1.49$. Using $^{3D}$BAROLO (Barolo),
we extract $H\alpha$ kinematic maps and corresponding Rotation Curves (RCs). The main advantage
of Barolo is that it incorporates the beam smearing in the 3D observational space, which provide
us with the intrinsic rotation velocity even in the low spatial resolution data. Using Asymmetric
Drift Correction (ADC), we have corrected the RCs for the pressure gradient effect, which seems
to be a more dominant effect than beam smearing in high-z galaxies. Nearly all objects ($0.1 <v/ \sigma<
15$) are affected by the pressure gradient, and we noticed that ADC improves the rotation velocity
of these systems by $\sim 10-87\%$. Only a combination of the three techniques (3D-kinematic modelling
+ 3D-Beamsmearing correction + ADC ) yields the intrinsic RC of an individual galaxy. Further, we
present the co-added RCs constructed out of 237 high-quality objects to obtain intrinsic RC shapes
out to 6.4 $\times$ disk scale length. We do not see any change in the shape of RCs with respect to the
local star-forming disk-type galaxies. In contrast, we do find a significant evolution in the stellar-disk
length ($R_D$) of the galaxies. Therefore, we conclude stellar disk evolves over cosmic time while
total mass distribution stays constant.
