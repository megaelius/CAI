We report on a search for artificial narrowband signals of 20 stars within the restricted Earth Transit
Zone as a part of the ten-year Breakthrough Listen (BL) search for extraterrestrial intelligence.
The restricted Earth Transit Zone is the region of the sky from which an observer would see the Earth
transit the Sun with an impact parameter of less than 0.5. This region of the sky is geometrically
unique, providing a potential way for an extraterrestrial intelligence to discover the Solar System.
The targets were nearby (7-143 pc) and the search covered an electromagnetic frequency range of
3.95-8.00 GHz. We used the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope to perform these observations with
the standard BL data recorder. We searched these data for artificial narrowband ($\sim$Hz) signals
with Doppler drift rates of $\pm 20$ Hz s$^{-1}$. We found one set of potential candidate signals
on the target HIP 109656 which was then found to be consistent with known properties of anthropogenic
radio frequency interference. We find no evidence for radio technosignatures from extraterrestrial
intelligence in our observations. The observing campaign achieved a minimum detectable flux which
would have allowed detections of emissions that were $10^{-3}$ to $0.88$ times as powerful as the
signaling capability of the Arecibo radar transmitter, for the nearest and furthest stars respectively.
We conclude that at least $8\%$ of the systems in the restricted Earth Transit Zone within 150 pc do
not possess the type of transmitters searched in this survey. To our knowledge, this is the first
targeted search for extraterrestrial intelligence of the restricted Earth Transit Zone. All data
