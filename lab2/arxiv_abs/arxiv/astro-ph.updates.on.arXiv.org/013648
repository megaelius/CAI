Colors of Type Ia supernovae in the first few days after explosion provide a potential discriminant
between different models. In this paper, we present $g-r$ colors of 65 Type Ia supernovae discovered
within 5 days from first light by the Zwicky Transient Facility in 2018, a sample that is about three
times larger than that in the literature. We find that $g-r$ colors are intrinsically rather homogeneous
at early phases, with about half of the dispersion attributable to photometric uncertainties ($\sigma_\mathrm{noise}\sim\sigma_\mathrm{int}\sim$
0.18 mag). Colors are nearly constant starting from 6 days after first light ($g-r\sim-0.15$ mag),
while the time evolution at earlier epochs is characterized by a continuous range of slopes, from
events rapidly transitioning from redder to bluer colors (slope of $\sim-0.25$ mag day$^{-1}$)
to events with a flatter evolution. The continuum in the slope distribution is in good agreement
both with models requiring some amount of $^{56}$Ni mixed in the outermost regions of the ejecta
and with "double-detonation" models having thin helium layers ($M_\mathrm{He}=0.01\,M_\odot$)
and varying carbon-oxygen core masses. At the same time, six events show evidence for a distinctive
"red bump" signature predicted by "double-detonation" models with larger helium masses. We finally
identify a significant correlation between the early-time $g-r$ slopes and supernova brightness,
with brighter events associated to flatter color evolution (p-value=0.006). The distribution
of slopes, however, is consistent with being drawn from a single population, with no evidence for
two components as claimed in the literature based on $B-V$ colors.
