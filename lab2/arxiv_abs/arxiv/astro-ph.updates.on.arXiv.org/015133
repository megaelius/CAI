We present new observations of Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) Blob 1 (LAB1) in the SSA22 protocluster
region ($z$ = 3.09) using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) and the Keck Multi-object Spectrometer
for Infrared Exploration (MOSFIRE). By applying matched filtering to the KCWI datacube, we have
created a narrow-band Ly$\alpha$ image and identified several prominent features. By comparing
the spatial distributions and intensities of Ly$\alpha$ and H$\beta$, we find that recombination
of photo-ionized HI gas followed by resonant scattering is sufficient to explain all the observed
Ly$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratios. We further decode the spatially-resolved Ly$\alpha$ profiles using
both moment maps and Monte-Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) modeling. By fitting a set of multiphase,
'clumpy' models to the observed Ly$\alpha$ profiles, we are able to reasonably constrain many parameters,
namely the HI number density in the inter-clump medium (ICM), the cloud volume filling factor, the
random velocity and outflow velocity of the clumps, the HI outflow velocity of the ICM and the local
systemic redshift. Our model has successfully reproduced the diverse Ly$\alpha$ morphologies
at different locations, and the main results are: (1) The observed Ly$\alpha$ spectra require relatively
few clumps per line-of-sight as they have significant fluxes at the line center; (2) The velocity
dispersion of the clumps yields a significant broadening of the spectra as observed; (3) The clump
bulk outflow can also cause additional broadening if the HI in the ICM is optically thick; (4) The
HI in the ICM is responsible for the absorption feature close to the Ly$\alpha$ line center.
