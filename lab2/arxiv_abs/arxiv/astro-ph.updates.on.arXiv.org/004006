We analyze the early X-ray flares in the GRB "flare-plateau-afterglow" (FPA) phase observed by
Swift-XRT. The FPA occurs only in one of the seven GRB subclasses: the binary-driven hypernovae
(BdHNe). This subclass consists of long GRBs with a carbon-oxygen core and a neutron star (NS) binary
companion as progenitors. The hypercritical accretion of the supernova (SN) ejecta onto the NS
can lead to the gravitational collapse of the NS into a black hole. Consequently, one can observe
a GRB emission with isotropic energy $E_{iso}\gtrsim10^{52}$~erg, as well as the associated GeV
emission and the FPA phase. Previous work had shown that gamma-ray spikes in the prompt emission
occur at $\sim 10^{15}$--$10^{17}$~cm with Lorentz gamma factor $\Gamma\sim10^{2}$--$10^{3}$.
Using a novel data analysis we show that the time of occurrence, duration, luminosity and total energy
of the X-ray flares correlate with $E_{iso}$. A crucial feature is the observation of thermal emission
in the X-ray flares that we show occurs at radii $\sim10^{12}$~cm with $\Gamma\lesssim 4$. These
model independent observations cannot be explained by the "fireball" model, which postulates
synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation from a single ultra relativistic jetted emission extending
from the prompt to the late afterglow and GeV emission phases. We show that in BdHNe a collision between
the GRB and the SN ejecta occurs at $\simeq10^{10}$~cm reaching transparency at $\sim10^{12}$~cm
with $\Gamma\lesssim4$. The agreement between the thermal emission observations and these theoretically
derived values validates our model and opens the possibility of testing each BdHN episode with the
corresponding Lorentz gamma factor.
