The joint use of accurate near- and mid-infrared photometry from the 2MASS and WISE catalogues has
allowed the variations of the extinction law and the dust grain size distribution in high Galactic
latitudes (|b|>50) at distances up to 3 kpc from the Galactic midplane to be analyzed. The modified
method of extrapolation of the extinction law applied to clump giants has turned out to be efficient
for separating the spatial variations of the sample composition, metallicity, reddening, and
properties of the medium. The detected spatial variations of the coefficients E(H-W1)/E(H-Ks),
E(H-W2)/E(H-Ks), and E(H-W3)/E(H-Ks) are similar for all high latitudes and depend only on the
distance from the Galactic midplane. The ratio of short-wavelength extinction to long-wavelength
one everywhere outside the Galactic disk has been found to be smaller than that in the disk and, accordingly,
the mean dust grain size is larger, while the grain size distribution in the range 0.5-11 microns
is shifted toward coarse dust. Specifically, the mean grain size initially increases sharply with
distance from the Galactic midplane, then decreases gradually, approaching a value typical of
the disk at $|Z|\approx2.4$ kpc, and, further out, stabilizes or may increase again. The coefficients
under consideration change with coordinate $Z$ with a period of about 1312\pm40 pc, coinciding
every 656\pm20 pc to the south and the north and showing a significant anticorrelation between their
values in the southern and northern hemispheres at intermediate Z. Thus, there exists a unified
large-scale periodic structure of the interstellar medium at high latitudes within at least 5 kpc.
The same periodic variations have also been found for the extinction coefficient Rv within 600 pc
of the Galactic midplane through the reduction of different photometric data for stars of different
classes.
