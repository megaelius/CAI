Filaments and coronal holes, two principal features observed in the solar corona are sources of
space weather variations. Filament formation is closely associated with polarity inversion lines
(PIL) on the solar photosphere which separate positive and negative polarities of the surface magnetic
field. The origin of coronal holes is governed by large-scale unipolar magnetic patches on the photosphere
from where open magnetic field lines extend to the heliosphere. We study properties of filaments,
PILs and coronal holes in solar cycles 20, 21, 22 and 23 utilizing the McIntosh archive. We detect
a prominent cyclic behavior of filament length, PIL length, and coronal hole area with significant
correspondence with the solar magnetic cycle. The spatio-temporal evolution of the geometric
centers of filaments shows a butterfly-like structure and distinguishable pole-ward migration
of long filaments during cycle maxima. We identify this rush to the poles of filaments to be co-temporal
with the initiation of polar field reversal as gleaned from Mount Wilson and Wilcox Solar Observatory
polar field observations and quantitatively establish their temporal correspondence. We analyze
the filament tilt angle distribution to constrain their possible origins. Majority of the filaments
exhibit negative and positive tilt angles in the northern and the southern hemispheres, respectively
-- strongly suggesting that their formation is governed by the overall large-scale magnetic field
distribution on the solar photosphere and not by the small-scale intra-active region magnetic
field configurations. We also investigate the hemispheric asymmetry in filaments, PILs, and coronal
holes. We find that the hemispheric asymmetry in filaments and PILs are positively correlated --
whereas coronal hole asymmetry is uncorrelated -- with sunspot area asymmetry.
