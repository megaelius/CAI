We present detections of [OIII]$\lambda$4363 and direct-method metallicities for star-forming
galaxies at $z=1.7-3.6$. We combine new measurements from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF)
survey with literature sources to construct a sample of 18 galaxies with direct-method metallicities
at $z>1$, spanning $7.5<1$2+log(O/H$)<8.2$ and log(M$_*$/M$_{\odot})=7-10$. We find that strong-line
calibrations based on local analogs of high-redshift galaxies reliably reproduce the metallicity
of the $z>1$ sample on average. We construct the first mass-metallicity relation at $z>1$ based
purely on direct-method O/H, finding a slope that is consistent with strong-line results. Direct-method
O/H evolves by $\lesssim0.1$ dex at fixed M$_*$ and SFR from $z\sim0-2.2$. We employ photoionization
models to constrain the ionization parameter and ionizing spectrum in the high-redshift sample.
Stellar models with super-solar O/Fe and binary evolution of massive stars are required to reproduce
the observed strong-line ratios. We find that the $z>1$ sample falls on the $z\sim0$ relation between
ionization parameter and O/H, suggesting no evolution of this relation from $z\sim0$ to $z\sim2$.
These results suggest that the offset of the strong-line ratios of this sample from local excitation
sequences is driven primarily by a harder ionizing spectrum at fixed nebular metallicity compared
to what is typical at $z\sim0$, naturally explained by super-solar O/Fe values at high redshift
caused by rapid formation timescales. Given the extreme nature of our $z>1$ sample, the implications
for representative $z\sim2$ galaxy samples at $\sim10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ are unclear, but similarities
to $z>6$ galaxies suggest that these conclusions can be extended to galaxies in the epoch of reionization.
