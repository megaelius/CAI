Pillars and globules are present in many high-mass star-forming regions, such as the Eagle nebula
(M16) and the Rosette molecular cloud, and understanding their origin will help characterize triggered
star formation. The formation mechanisms of these structures are still being debated. Recent numerical
simulations have shown how pillars can arise from the collapse of the shell in on itself and how globules
can be formed from the interplay of the turbulent molecular cloud and the ionization from massive
stars. The goal here is to test this scenario through recent observations of two massive star-forming
regions, M16 and Rosette. The column density structure of the interface between molecular clouds
and H ii regions was characterized using column density maps obtained from far-infrared imaging
of the Herschel HOBYS key programme. Then, the DisPerSe algorithm was used on these maps to detect
the compressed layers around the ionized gas and pillars in different evolutionary states. Finally,
their velocity structure was investigated using CO data, and all observational signatures were
tested against some distinct diagnostics established from simulations. The column density profiles
have revealed the importance of compression at the edge of the ionized gas. The velocity properties
of the structures, i.e. pillars and globules, are very close to what we predict from the numerical
simulations. We have identified a good candidate of a nascent pillar in the Rosette molecular cloud
that presents the velocity pattern of the shell collapsing on itself, induced by a high local curvature.
Globules have a bulk velocity dispersion that indicates the importance of the initial turbulence
in their formation, as proposed from numerical simulations. Altogether, this study re-enforces
the picture of pillar formation by shell collapse and globule formation by the ionization of highly
turbulent clouds.
