One of the main science motivations for the ESA PLAnetary Transit and Oscillations (PLATO) mission
is to measure exoplanet transit radii with 3% precision. In addition to flares and starspots, stellar
oscillations and granulation will enforce fundamental noise floors for transiting exoplanet
radius measurements. We simulate light curves of Earth-sized exoplanets transiting continuum
intensity images of the Sun taken by the HMI instrument aboard SDO to investigate the uncertainties
introduced on the exoplanet radius measurements by stellar granulation and oscillations. After
modeling the solar variability with a Gaussian process, we find that the amplitude of solar oscillations
and granulation is of order 100 ppm -- similar to the depth of an Earth transit -- and introduces a fractional
uncertainty on the depth of transit of 0.73% assuming four transits are observed over the mission
duration. However, when we translate the depth measurement into a radius measurement of the planet,
we find a much larger radius uncertainty of 3.6%. This is due to a degeneracy between the transit radius
ratio, the limb-darkening, and the impact parameter caused by the inability to constrain the transit
impact parameter in the presence of stellar variability. We find that surface brightness inhomogeneity
due to photospheric granulation contributes a lower limit of only 2 ppm to the photometry in-transit.
The radius uncertainty due to granulation and oscillations, combined with the degeneracy with
the transit impact parameter, accounts for a significant fraction of the error budget of the PLATO
mission, before detector or observational noise is introduced to the light curve. If it is possible
to constrain the impact parameter or to obtain follow-up observations at longer wavelengths where
limb-darkening is less significant, this may enable higher precision radius measurements.
