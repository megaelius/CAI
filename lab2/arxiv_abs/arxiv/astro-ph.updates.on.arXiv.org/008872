Recently, relations connecting the SMBH mass and global properties of the hosting galaxy cluster,
such as temperature and mass, were observed. We investigate the correlation between SMBH mass and
cluster mass and temperature, their establishment and evolution. We compare their scatter to that
of the classical $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm BCG}$ relation. Moreover, we study how gas accretion and BH-BH
mergers contribute to SMBH growth across cosmic time. We employ 135 groups and clusters with a mass
range $1.4\times 10^{13}M_{\odot}-2.5\times 10^{15} M_{\odot}$ extracted from a set of 29 zoom-in
cosmological hydro-dynamical simulations where the baryonic physics is treated with various
sub-grid models, including feedback by active galactic nuclei. In our simulations we find that
$M_{\rm BH}$ well correlates with $M_{500}$ and $T_{500}$, with the scatter around these relations
compatible within $2\sigma$ with the scatter around $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm BCG}$ at $z=0$. The $M_{\rm
BH}-M_{500}$ relation evolves with time, becoming shallower at lower redshift as a direct consequence
of hierarchical structure formation. In our simulations, SMBHs mainly grow by gas accretion at
redshift $z>2$. At redshift $z<1$ the main growth channel is instead the BH-BH merging. During this
last process, substructures hosting BHs are disrupted in the merger process with the BCG and the
unbound stars enrich the diffuse stellar component rather than contribute to increase BCG mass.
From the results obtained in our simulations with simple sub-grid models we conclude that the scatter
around the $M_{\rm BH}-T_{500}$ relation is comparable to the scatter around the $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm
BCG}$ relation and that, given the observational difficulties related to the estimation of the
BCG mass, clusters temperature and mass can be a useful proxy for the SMBHs mass, especially at high
redshift.
