The Canada France Hawaii Telescope Corporation (CFHT) plans to repurpose its observatory on the
summit of Maunakea and operate a new wide field spectroscopic survey telescope, the Maunakea Spectroscopic
Explorer (MSE). MSE will upgrade the observatory with a larger 11.25m aperture telescope and equip
it with dedicated instrumentation to capitalize on the site, which has some of the best seeing in
the northern hemisphere, and offer its user community the ability to do transformative science.
The knowledge and experience of the current CFHT staff will contribute greatly to the engineering
of this new facility. MSE will reuse the same building and telescope pier as CFHT. However, it will
be necessary to upgrade the support pier to accommodate a bigger telescope and replace the current
dome since a wider slit opening of 12.5 meters in diameter is needed. Once the project is completed
the new facility will be almost indistinguishable on the outside from the current CFHT observatory.
MSE will build upon CFHT's pioneering work in remote operations, with no staff at the observatory
during the night, and use modern technologies to reduce daytime maintenance work. This paper describes
the design approach for redeveloping the CFHT facility for MSE including the infrastructure and
equipment considerations required to support and facilitate nighttime observations. The building
will be designed so existing equipment and infrastructure can be reused wherever possible while
meeting new requirement demands. Past experience and lessons learned will be used to create a modern,
optimized, and logical layout of the facility. The purpose of this paper is to provide information
to readers involved in the MSE project or organizations involved with the redevelopment of an existing
observatory facility for a new mission.
