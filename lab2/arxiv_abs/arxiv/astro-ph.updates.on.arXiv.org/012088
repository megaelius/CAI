We present a novel retrieval technique that attempts to model phase curve observations of exoplanets
more realistically and reliably, which we call the 2.5-dimension (2.5-D) approach. In our 2.5-D
approach we retrieve the vertical temperature profile and mean gaseous abundance of a planet at
all longitudes and latitudes \textbf{simultaneously}, assuming that the temperature or composition,
$x$, at a particular longitude and latitude $(\Lambda,\Phi)$ is given by $x(\Lambda,\Phi) = \bar{x}
+ (x(\Lambda,0) - \bar{x})\cos^n\Phi$, where $\bar{x}$ is the mean of the morning and evening terminator
values of $x(\Lambda,0)$, and $n$ is an assumed coefficient. We compare our new 2.5-D scheme with
the more traditional 1-D approach, which assumes the same temperature profile and gaseous abundances
at all points on the visible disc of a planet for each individual phase observation, using a set of
synthetic phase curves generated from a GCM-based simulation. We find that our 2.5-D model fits
these data more realistically than the 1-D approach, confining the hotter regions of the planet
more closely to the dayside. We then apply both models to WASP-43b phase curve observations of HST/WFC3
and Spitzer/IRAC. We find that the dayside of WASP-43b is apparently much hotter than the nightside
and show that this could be explained by the presence of a thick cloud on the nightside with a cloud
top at pressure $< 0.2$ bar. We further show that while the mole fraction of water vapour is reasonably
well constrained to $(1-10)\times10^{-4}$, the abundance of CO is very difficult to constrain
with these data since it is degenerate with temperature and prone to possible systematic radiometric
differences between the HST/WFC3 and Spitzer/IRAC observations. Hence, it is difficult to reliably
constrain C/O.
