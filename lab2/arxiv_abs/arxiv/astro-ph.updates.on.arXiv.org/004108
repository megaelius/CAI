We study a dark matter (DM) model offering a very natural explanation of two (naively unrelated)
problems in cosmology: the observed relation $\Omega_{\rm DM}\sim\Omega_{\rm visible}$ and
the observed asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the Universe, known as the "baryogenesis"
problem. In this framework, both types of matter (dark and visible) have the same QCD origin, form
at the same QCD epoch, and both proportional to one and the same dimensional parameter of the system,
$\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$, which explains how these two, naively distinct, problems could be intimately
related, and could be solved simultaneously within the same framework. More specifically, the
DM in this model is composed by two different ingredients: the (well- studied) DM axions and (less-studied)
the quark nuggets made of matter or antimatter. The focus of the present work is the quantitative
analysis of the relation between these two distinct components contributing to the dark sector
of the theory determined by $\Omega_{\rm DM}\equiv [\Omega_{\rm DM}(\rm nuggets)+ \Omega_{\rm
DM}(\rm axion)]$. We argue that the nugget's DM component always traces the visible matter density,
i.e. $\Omega_{\rm DM}(\rm nuggets)\sim\Omega_{\rm visible}$ and this feature is not sensitive
to the parameters of the system such as the axion mass $m_a$ or the misalignment angle $\theta_0$.
It should be contrasted with conventional axion production mechanism due to the misalignment when
$\Omega_{\rm DM}(\rm axion)$ is highly sensitive to the axion mass $m_a$ and the initial misalignment
angle $\theta_0$. We also discuss the constraints on this model related to the inflationary scale
$H_I$, non-observation of the isocurvature perturbations, $r_T < 0.12$, and also, varies axions
search experiments.
