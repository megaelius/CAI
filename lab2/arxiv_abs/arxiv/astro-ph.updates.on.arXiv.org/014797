We present nebular spectra of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2019yvq, which had a bright flash of
blue and ultraviolet light after exploding, after which it rose in a manner similar to other SNe Ia.
Although SN 2019yvq displayed several other rare characteristics such as persistent high ejecta
velocity near peak brightness, it was not especially peculiar and if the early "excess" emission
were not observed, it would likely be included in cosmological samples. The excess flux can be explained
by several different physical models linked to the details of the progenitor system and explosion
mechanism. Each has unique predictions for the optically thin emission at late times. In our nebular
spectra, we detect strong [Ca II] $\lambda\lambda$7291, 7324 and Ca NIR triplet emission, consistent
with a double-detonation explosion. We do not detect H, He, or [O I] emission, predictions for some
single-degenerate progenitor systems and violent white dwarf mergers. The amount of swept-up
H or He is <2.8 x 10^-4 and 2.4 x 10^-4 Msun, respectively. Aside from strong Ca emission, the SN 2019yvq
nebular spectrum is similar to those of typical SNe Ia with the same light-curve shape. The nebular
lines are blueshifted relative to their rest-frame wavelengths, which is atypical for a high-velocity
SN Ia like SN 2019yvq. Comparing to theoretical spectra of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf
undergoing a double-detonation, we find close agreement with a model with a total progenitor mass
of 1.15 Msun. The unique properties of SN 2019yvq suggest that thick He-shell double-detonations
only account for $1.1^{+2.1}_{-1.1}\%$ of the total "normal" SN Ia rate. SN 2019yvq is one of the
best examples yet that multiple progenitor channels appear necessary to reproduce the full diversity
of "normal" SNe Ia.
