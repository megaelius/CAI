[Shortened] CONTEXT: [...] AIMS: To identify and verify the BdHNe I properties in the additional
sources GRB160509A, GRB160625B and GRB1340427A, and compare and contrast the results with the
ones of a BdHN II source GRB180728A. We have also identified in all four sources, following the analysis
GRB 130427A in the companion paper, the GeV radiation during and following the UPE phase. Also in
all the four sources, we describe the spectral properties of their afterglow emission, including
the mass estimate of the $\nu$NS, following the results presented in the companion paper. METHODS:
[...] RESULTS: The results of the spectral analysis have validated the common properties in all
BdHNe I: the three Episodes as well as the self-similar structures and the associated power-laws
in the UPE phase. The profound similarities of the results have made a significant step forward in
the taxonomy of GRBs and in evidencing a standard composition of the BdHN I. This opens the opportunity
of a vaster inquire of the astrophysical nature of their components in the population synthesis
approach: e.g., the BH formation in all BdHN I occurs due to accretion of the SN ejecta in a tight binary
system with a neutron star companion which reaches its critical mass, leading to the formation of
the BH. The SN-rise in all five BdHNe are compare and contrasted. CONCLUSIONS: The most far reaching
discovery of self-similarities and power-laws here extensively confirmed, thanks also to the
conclusions presented in the companion papers, leads to the existence of a discrete quantized repetitive
polarized emission, both in the GeV and MeV observed by {\it Fermi}-GBM and {\it Fermi}-LAT, on a
timescale as short as $10^{-14}$s. These results open new paths in the discovery of fundamental
physical laws.
