Using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space Telescope, we measured the abundances
of six ions (C III, C IV, Si III, Si IV, N V, O VI) in the low-redshift (z < 0.4) intergalactic medium
and explored C and Si ionization corrections from adjacent ion stages. Both C IV and Si IV have increased
in abundance by a factor of ~10 from z = 5.5 to the present. We derive ion mass densities, (rho_ion)
= (Omega_ion)(rho_cr) with Omega_ion expressed relative to closure density. Our models of the
mass-abundance ratios, (Si III / Si IV) = 0.67(+0.35,-0.19), (C III / C IV) = 0.70(+0.43,-0.20),
and (Omega_CIII + Omega_CIV) / (Omega_SiIII + Omega_SiIV) = 4.9(+2.2,-1.1), are consistent with
a hydrogen photoionization rate Gamma_H = (8 +/- 2) x 10^{-14} s^{-1} at z < 0.4 and specific intensity
I_0 = (3 +/- 1) x 10^{-23} erg/(cm^2 s Hz sr) at the Lyman limit. We find mean photoionization parameter
log U = -1.5 +/- 0.4, baryon overdensity Delta_b = 200 +/- 50, and Si/C enhanced to three times its solar
ratio (enhancement of alpha-process elements). We compare these metal abundances to the expected
IGM enrichment and abundances in higher photoionized states of carbon (C V) and silicon (Si V, Si
VI, Si VII). Our ionization modeling infers IGM metal densities of (5.4 +/- 0.5) x 10^5 M_sun / Mpc^3
in the photoionized Lya forest traced by the C and Si ions and (9.1 +/- 0.6) x 10^5 M_sun / Mpc^3 in hotter
gas traced by O VI. Combining both phases, the heavy elements in the IGM have mass density rho_Z = (1.5
+/- 0.8) x 10^6 M_sun / Mpc^3 or Omega_Z = 10^{-5}. This represents 10 +/- 5 percent of the metals produced
by (6 +/- 2) x 10^8 M_sun / Mpc^3 of integrated star formation with yield y_m = 0.025 +/- 0.010. The missing
metals at low redshift may reside within galaxies and in undetected ionized gas in galaxy halos and
circumgalactic medium.
