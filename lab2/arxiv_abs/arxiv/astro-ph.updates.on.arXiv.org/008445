We present Hubble Space Telescope WFC3-IR imaging in the fields of six apparently bright dusty star-forming
galaxies (DSFGs) at $z$ = 2-4 identified by their rest-frame far-infrared colors using the Planck
and Herschel space facilities. We detect near-infrared counterparts for all six submillimeter
sources, allowing us to undertake strong-lensing analyses. One field in particular stands out
for its prominent giant arcs, PLCK G165.7+67.0 (G165). After combining the color and morphological
information, we identify 11 sets of image multiplicities in this one field. We construct a strong-lensing
model constrained by this lensing evidence, which uncovers a bimodal spatial mass distribution,
and from which we measure a mass of $(2.6 \pm 0.11)$ $\times$ $10^{14}$ $M_{\odot}$ within $\sim$250
kpc. The bright ($S_{350}$ $\approx$ 750 mJy) DSFG appears as two images: a giant arc with a spatial
extent of 4.5" that is merging with the critical curve, and a lower-magnification counterimage
that is detected in our new longer-wavelength ground- and space-based imaging data. Using our ground-based
spectroscopy, we calculate a dynamical mass of $1.3^{+0.04}_{-0.70} \times 10^{15}$ $M_{\odot}$
to the same fixed radius, although this value may be inflated relative to the true value if the velocity
distribution is enhanced in the line-of-sight direction. We suggest that the bimodal mass taken
in combination with the weak X-ray flux and low SZ decrement may be explained as a pre-merger for which
the intracluster gas is diluted along the line of sight, while the integrated surface mass density
is supercritical to strong-lensing effects.
