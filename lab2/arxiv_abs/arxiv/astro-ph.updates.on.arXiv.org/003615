The Cherenkov Telescope Array, CTA, will be the major global observatory for very high energy gamma-ray
astronomy over the next decade and beyond. The scientific potential of CTA is extremely broad: from
understanding the role of relativistic cosmic particles to the search for dark matter. CTA is an
explorer of the extreme universe, probing environments from the immediate neighbourhood of black
holes to cosmic voids on the largest scales. Covering a huge range in photon energy from 20 GeV to 300
TeV, CTA will improve on all aspects of performance with respect to current instruments. The observatory
will operate arrays on sites in both hemispheres to provide full sky coverage and will hence maximize
the potential for the rarest phenomena such as very nearby supernovae, gamma-ray bursts or gravitational
wave transients. With 99 telescopes on the southern site and 19 telescopes on the northern site,
flexible operation will be possible, with sub-arrays available for specific tasks. CTA will have
important synergies with many of the new generation of major astronomical and astroparticle observatories.
Multi-wavelength and multi-messenger approaches combining CTA data with those from other instruments
will lead to a deeper understanding of the broad-band non-thermal properties of target sources.
The CTA Observatory will be operated as an open, proposal-driven observatory, with all data available
on a public archive after a pre-defined proprietary period. Scientists from institutions worldwide
have combined together to form the CTA Consortium. This Consortium has prepared a proposal for a
Core Programme of highly motivated observations. The programme, encompassing approximately
40% of the available observing time over the first ten years of CTA operation, is made up of individual
Key Science Projects (KSPs), which are presented in this document.
