We study the impact of the host on dwarf galaxy properties using four new Milky Way-like, ultra high-resolution
simulations, ($N_{\rm part} >10^7$) from the NIHAO project. We split our sample in satellite ($R<R_{200}$),
nearby ($1<R/R_{200}<2.5$), and field ($R>2.5 R_{\rm 200}$) galaxies. Simulated galaxies from
all three groups are in excellent agreement with Local Group dwarf galaxies in terms of: stellar
mass-velocity dispersion, stellar mass-metallicity relation, star formation histories, and
stellar mass functions. Satellites and nearby galaxies show lower velocity dispersions and gas
fractions compared to field galaxies. While field galaxies follow global abundance matching relations,
satellites and nearby galaxies deviate from them, showing lower dark matter masses for given stellar
mass. The reason for this deficit in dark matter mass is substantial mass loss experienced by satellites
and $\sim80$\% of the nearby galaxies, while orbiting inside $R_{200}$ at earlier times. However,
both satellites and nearby objects fall back onto the relation for field galaxies if we use the maximum
of their virial mass instead of the present-day value. This allows us to provide estimates for the
peak masses of observed Local Group galaxies. Finally, using radial velocities, distances, and
the velocity dispersion-stellar mass relation from our simulations, we derive a metric to distinguish
between galaxies harassed by the central object and unaffected ones. Applying this metric to observed
objects we find that even far away dwarf galaxies like Eri II ($D\approx$ 370 kpc) have a strong probability
($\approx 83$\%) of having been affected by the Milky Way in the past. This naturally explains the
lack of gas and recent star formation seen in Eri II.
