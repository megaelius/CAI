The Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) survey is a large-scale stellar spectroscopic survey
of the Milky Way and designed to deliver chemical information complementary to a large number of
stars covered by the $Gaia$ mission. We present the GALAH second public data release (GALAH DR2)
containing 342,682 stars. For these stars, the GALAH collaboration provides stellar parameters
and abundances for up to 23 elements to the community. Here we present the target selection, observation,
data reduction and detailed explanation of how the spectra were analysed to estimate stellar parameters
and element abundances. For the stellar analysis, we have used a multi-step approach. We use the
physics-driven spectrum synthesis of Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME) to derive stellar labels ($T_\mathrm{eff}$,
$\log g$, $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$, $\mathrm{[X/Fe]}$, $v_\mathrm{mic}$, $v \sin i$, $A_{K_S}$) for
a representative training set of stars. This information is then propagated to the whole survey
with the data-driven method of $The~Cannon$. Special care has been exercised in the spectral synthesis
to only consider spectral lines that have reliable atomic input data and are little affected by blending
lines. Departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) are considered for several key elements,
including Li, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, and Fe, using 1D MARCS stellar atmosphere models. Validation tests
including repeat observations, Gaia benchmark stars, open and globular clusters, and K2 asteroseismic
targets lend confidence in our methods and results. Combining the GALAH DR2 catalogue with the kinematic
information from $Gaia$ will enable a wide range of Galactic Archaeology studies, with unprecedented
detail, dimensionality, and scope.
