The Argentine Institute of Radio astronomy (IAR) is equipped with two single-dish 30mts radio antennas
capable of performing daily observations of pulsars and radio transients in the southern hemisphere
at 1.4 GHz. We aim to introduce to the international community the upgrades performed and to show
that IAR observatory has become suitable for investigations in numerous areas of pulsar radio astronomy,
such as pulsar timing arrays, targeted searches of continuous gravitational waves sources, monitoring
of magnetars and glitching pulsars, and studies of short time scale interstellar scintillation.
We refurbished the two antennas at IAR to achieve high-quality timing observations. We gathered
more than $1\,000$ hours of observations with both antennas to study the timing precision and sensitivity
they can achieve. We introduce the new developments for both radio telescopes at IAR. We present
observations of the millisecond pulsar J0437$-$4715 with timing precision better than 1~$\mu$s.
We also present a follow-up of the reactivation of the magnetar XTE J1810--197 and the measurement
and monitoring of the latest (Feb. 1st. 2019) glitch of the Vela pulsar (J0835--4510). We show that
IAR is capable of performing pulsar monitoring in the 1.4 GHz radio band for long periods of time with
a daily cadence. This opens the possibility of pursuing several goals in pulsar science, including
coordinated multi-wavelength observations with other observatories. In particular, observations
of the millisecond pulsar J0437$-$4715 will increase the gravitational wave sensitivity of the
NANOGrav array in their current blind spot. We also show IAR's great potential for studying targets
of opportunity and transient phenomena such as magnetars, glitches, and fast-radio-burst sources.
