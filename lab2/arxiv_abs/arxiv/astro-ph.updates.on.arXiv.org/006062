Solar supergranulation presents us with many mysteries. For example, previous studies in spectral
space found that supergranulation has wave-like properties. Here we study, in real space, the wave-like
evolution of the average supergranule over a range of spatial scales (from 10 to 80 Mm). We complement
this by characterizing the evolution of the associated network magnetic field. We use one year of
data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) to measure horizontal near-surface flows
near the solar equator by applying time-distance helioseismology on Dopplergrams and granulation
tracking on intensity images. The average supergranule outflow (or inflow) is constructed by averaging
over 10000 individual outflows (or inflows). The contemporaneous evolution of the magnetic field
is studied with HMI line-of-sight observations. We confirm and extend previous measurements of
the supergranular wave dispersion relation to angular wavenumbers in the range 50<kR<270. We find
a plateau for kR>120. In real space, larger supergranules undergo oscillations with longer periods
and lifetimes than smaller cells. We find excellent agreement between TD and LCT and obtain wave
properties that are independent of the tracking rate. The observed network magnetic field follows
the oscillations of the supergranular flows with a six-hour time lag. This behavior can be explained
by computing the motions of corks carried by the supergranular flows. Signatures of supergranular
waves in surface horizontal flows near the solar equator can be observed in real space. These oscillatory
flows control the evolution of the network magnetic field, in particular they explain the recently
discovered east-west anisotropy of the magnetic field around the average supergranule. Background
flow measurements that we obtain from Doppler frequency shifts do not favor shallow models of supergranulation.
