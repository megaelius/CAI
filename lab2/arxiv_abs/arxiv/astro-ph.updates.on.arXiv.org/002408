The database of intermediate mass rotating stellar models presented in the past years by the Geneva
Stellar Evolution Group can be used to build synthetic stellar populations that fully account for
the effects of stellar rotation. However, up to now we still lacked stellar evolutionary tracks
that rotate close to the critical limit during the whole MS phase. This occurs because the flat internal
profile of rotation imposed at the Zero-Age MS (ZAMS) is modified by the action of meridional currents
immediately after the ZAMS, causing the surface rotational velocity to decrease abruptly until
it reaches a quasi-stationary state. We compute stellar models with non-solid rotation at the ZAMS
to obtain stellar evolutionary tracks with a larger content of angular momentum, that attain rotational
equatorial velocities close to the critical limit throughout their MS phase. These models have
a longer MS lifetime and a higher surface chemical enrichment already at the end of the MS, particularly
at Z=0.002. Stellar models with solid rotation at the ZAMS adequately represent the overall characteristics
and evolution of differentially rotating models of identical angular momentum content, but with
a lower initial surface rotational velocity. For these models we recommend to use as the initial
rotational rate the values derived once the quasi-stationary state is reached, after the abrupt
decrease in surface velocity. Interestingly, the initial equatorial rotational velocities are
virtually metallicity independent for the stellar models we computed with the same mass and angular
momentum content at the ZAMS. If, as some observational evidence indicates, B-type stars at Z=0.002
rotate with a higher equatorial velocity at the ZAMS than stars with Z=0.014, our finding would indicate
that the angular momentum content of B-type stars in the SMC is higher than their Galactic counterparts.
