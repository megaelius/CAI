Our current insights into the circumstellar chemistry of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are
largely based on studies of carbon-rich stars and stars with high mass-loss rates. In order to expand
the current molecular inventory of evolved stars we present a spectral scan of the nearby, oxygen-rich
star R Dor, a star with a low mass-loss rate ($\sim2\times10^{-7}M_{\odot}$/yr). We carried out
a spectral scan in the frequency ranges 159.0-321.5GHz and 338.5-368.5 GHz (wavelength range 0.8-1.9mm)
using the SEPIA/Band-5 and SHeFI instruments on the APEX telescope and we compare it to previous
surveys, including one of the oxygen-rich AGB star IK Tau, which has a high mass-loss rate ($\sim5\times10^{-6}M_{\odot}$/yr).
The spectrum of R Dor is dominated by emission lines of SO$_2$ and the different isotopologues of
SiO. We also detect CO, H$_2$O, HCN, CN, PO, PN, SO, and tentatively TiO$_2$, AlO, and NaCl. Sixteen
out of approximately 320 spectral features remain unidentified. Among these is a strong but previously
unknown maser at 354.2 GHz, which we suggest could pertain to H$_2$SiO, silanone. With the exception
of one, none of these unidentified lines are found in a similarly sensitive survey of IK Tau performed
with the IRAM 30m telescope. We present radiative transfer models for five isotopologues of SiO
($^{28}$SiO, $^{29}$SiO, $^{30}$SiO, Si$^{17}$O, Si$^{18}$O), providing constraints on their
fractional abundance and radial extent. We derive isotopic ratios for C, O, Si, and S and estimate
that R Dor likely had an initial mass in the range 1.3-1.6$M_{\odot}$, in agreement with earlier
findings based on models of H$_2$O line emission. From the presence of spectral features recurring
in many of the measured thermal and maser emission lines we tentatively identify up to five kinematical
components in the outflow of R Dor, indicating deviations from a smooth, spherical wind.
