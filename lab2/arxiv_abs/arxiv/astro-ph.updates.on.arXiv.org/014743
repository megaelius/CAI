Potential evidence for primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) is expected to lie in the largest scales
mapped by cosmological surveys. Forthcoming 21cm intensity mapping experiments will aim to probe
these scales by surveying neutral hydrogen (HI) within galaxies. However, foreground signals
dominate the faint 21cm emission, meaning foreground cleaning is required to recover the cosmological
signal. The effect this has is to damp the HI power spectrum on the largest scales, especially along
the line-of-sight. Whilst there is agreement that this contamination is potentially problematic
for probing PNG, it is yet to be fully explored and quantified. In this work we carry out the first forecasts
on $f_\text{NL}$ that incorporate simulated foreground maps that are removed using techniques
employed in real data. Using an MCMC analysis, we demonstrate that foreground cleaned data recovers
hugely biased values ($f_\text{NL} = -102.1_{-7.96}^{+8.39}$ [68% CL]) on our $f_\text{NL}=0$
fiducial input. Introducing a model with fixed parameters for the foreground contamination allows
us to recover unbiased results ($f_\text{NL} = -2.94_{-11.9}^{+11.4}$). However, it is not clear
that we will have sufficient understanding of foreground contamination to allow for such rigid
models. Treating the main parameter $k_\parallel^\text{FG}$ in our foreground model as a nuisance
parameter and marginalizing over it, still recovers unbiased results but at the expense of much
larger errors ($f_\text{NL} = 0.75^{+40.2}_{-44.5}$), that can only be reduced by imposing the
Planck 2018 prior. Our results show that significant progress on understanding and controlling
foreground removal effects is necessary in order to study PNG with HI intensity mapping.
