We explore the basic parameters that drive the evolution of the fundamental properties of star forming
galaxies within the gas regulator model, or bathtub-model. We derive the general analytic form
of the evolution of the key galaxy properties, i.e. gas mass, star formation rate (SFR), stellar
mass, specific SFR, gas fraction, gas phase metallicity and stellar metallicity, without assuming
that galaxies live in the equilibrium state. We find that the timescale required to reach equilibrium,
tau_eq, which is determined by the product of star-formation efficiency and mass-loading factor,
is the central parameter in the gas regulator model that is essentially in control of the evolution
of all key galaxy properties. The scatters in most of the key scaling relations are primarily governed
by tau_eq. Most strikingly, the predicted sSFR evolution is controlled solely by tau_eq (apart
from the cosmic time). Although the precise evolution of the sSFR depends on tau_eq, the sSFR history
is largely insensitive to different values of tau_eq. The difference between the minimum and maximum
sSFR at any epoch is less than a factor of four. The shape of the predicted sSFR history simply mimics
that of the specific mass increase rate of the dark matter halos (sMIR_DM) with the typical value
of the sSFR around 2*sMIR_DM. The predicted sSFR from the gas regulator model is in good agreement
with typical Semi-Analytic Models (SAMs), but both are fundamentally different from the observed
sSFR history. This clearly implies that some key process is missing in both typical SAMs and gas regulator
model, and we hint at some possible culprit. We emphasize the critical role of tau_eq in controlling
the evolution of the galaxy population, especially for gas rich low mass galaxies that are very unlikely
to live around the equilibrium state at any epoch and this has been largely ignored in many similar
studies.
