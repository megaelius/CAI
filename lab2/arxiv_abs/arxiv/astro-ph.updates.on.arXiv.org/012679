We have developed observation control software for the Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer
(IGRINS) slit-viewing camera module, which maintains the position of an astronomical target on
the spectroscopic slit. It is composed of several packages that monitor and control the system,
acquire the images, and compensate for the tracking error by sending tracking feedback information
to the telescope control system. For efficient development and maintenance of each software package,
we have applied software engineering methods, i.e., a spiral software development with model-based
design. It is not trivial to define the shape and center of astronomical object point spread functions
(PSFs), which do not have symmetric Gaussian profiles in short exposure (<4 s) guiding images. Efforts
to determine the PSF centroid are additionally complicated by the core saturation of bright guide
stars. We have applied both a two-dimensional Gaussian fitting algorithm (2DGA) and center balancing
algorithm (CBA) to identify an appropriate method for IGRINS in the near-infrared K-band. The CBA
derives the expected center position along the slit-width by referencing the spillover flux ratio
of the PSF wings on both sides of the slit. In this research, we have compared the accuracy and reliability
of the CBA to the 2DGA by using data from IGRINS commissioning observations at McDonald Observatory.
We find that the performance of each algorithm depends on the brightness of the targets and the seeing
conditions, with the CBA performing better in typical observing scenarios. The algorithms and
test results we present can be utilized with future spectroscopic slit observations in various
observing conditions and for a variety of spectrograph designs.
