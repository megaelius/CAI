A unified numerically solvable framework for dispersion relations with arbitrary number of species
drifting at arbitrary directions and with Krook collision is derived for linear uniform/homogenous
kinetic plasma, which largely extended the standard one [say, T. Stix, {\em Waves in Plasmas}, AIP
Press, 1992]. The purpose of this work is to provide a kinetic plasma dispersion relation tool not
only the physical model but also the numerical approach be as general/powerful as possible. As a
very general application example, we give the final dispersion relations which assume further
the equilibrium distribution function be bi-Maxwellian and including parallel drift, two directions
of perpendicular drift (i.e., drift across magnetic field), ring beam and loss-cone. Both electromagnetic
and electrostatic versions are provided, with also the Darwin (a.k.a., magnetoinductive or magnetostatic)
version. The species can be treated either magnetized or unmagnetized. Later, the equations are
transformed to the matrix form be solvable by using the powerful matrix algorithm [H. S. Xie and Y.
Xiao, Plasma Science and Technology, 18, 2, 97, 2016], which is the first approach can give all the
important solutions of a linear kinetic plasma system without requiring initial guess for root
finding and thus can be extremely useful to the community. To our knowledge, the present model would
be the most comprehensive one in literature for the distribution function constructed bases on
Maxwellian, which thus can be applied widely for study waves and instabilities in space, astrophysics,
fusion and laser plasma. We limit the present work to non-relativistic case.
