We present the star formation histories of 39 galaxies with high quality rest-frame optical spectra
at 0.5<z<1.3 selected to have strong Balmer absorption lines and/or Balmer break, and compare to
a sample of spectroscopically selected quiescent galaxies at the same redshift. Photometric selection
identifies a majority of objects that have clear evidence for a recent short-lived burst of star
formation within the last 1.5 Gyr, i.e. "post-starburst" galaxies, however we show that good quality
continuum spectra are required to obtain physical parameters such as burst mass fraction and burst
age. Dust attenuation appears to be the primary cause for misidentification of post-starburst
galaxies, leading to contamination in spectroscopic samples where only the [OII] emission line
is available, as well as a small fraction of objects lost from photometric samples. The 31 confirmed
post-starburst galaxies have formed 40-90% of their stellar mass in the last 1-1.5 Gyr. We use the
derived star formation histories to find that the post-starburst galaxies are visible photometrically
for 0.5-1 Gyr. This allows us to update a previous analysis to suggest that 25-50% of the growth of
the red sequence at z~1 could be caused by a starburst followed by rapid quenching. We use the inferred
maximum historical star formation rates of several 100-1000 Msun/yr and updated visibility times
to confirm that sub-mm galaxies are likely progenitors of post-starburst galaxies. The short quenching
timescales of 100-200 Myr are consistent with cosmological hydrodynamic models in which rapid
quenching is caused by the mechanical expulsion of gas due to an AGN.
