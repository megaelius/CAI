Black hole masses are found to correlate with several global properties of their host galaxies,
suggesting that black holes and galaxies have an intertwined evolution and that active galactic
nuclei (AGN) have a significant impact on galaxy evolution. Since the large-scale environment
can also affect AGN, this work studies how their formation and properties depend on the environment.
We use a reconstructed three-dimensional high-resolution density field obtained from a Bayesian
large-scale structure reconstruction method applied to the 2M++ galaxy sample. A web-type classification
relying on the shear tensor is used to identify different structures on the cosmic web, defining
voids, sheets, filaments, and clusters. We confirm that the environmental density affects the
AGN formation and their properties. We found that the AGN abundance is equivalent to the galaxy abundance,
indicating that active and non-active galaxies reside in similar dark matter halos. However, occurrence
rates are different for each spectral type and accretion rate. These differences are consistent
with the AGN evolutionary sequence suggested by previous authors, Seyferts and Transition objects
transforming into LINERs (Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission Line Regions), the weaker counterpart
of Seyferts. We concluded that AGN properties depend on the environmental density more than on the
web-type. More powerful starbursts and younger stellar populations are found in high densities,
where interactions and mergers are more likely. AGN hosts show smaller masses in clusters for Seyferts
and Transition objects, which might be due to gas stripping. In voids, the AGN population is dominated
by the most massive galaxy hosts.
