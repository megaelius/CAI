Galaxy clusters are the largest virialized structures in the observable Universe. The knowledge
of their properties provides many useful astrophysical and cosmological information. Our aim
is to derive the luminosity and stellar mass profiles of the nearby galaxy clusters of the Omega-WINGS
survey and to study the main scaling relations valid for such systems. We have merged the data of the
WINGS and Omega-WINGS databases, sorted the sources according to the distance from the brightest
cluster galaxy (BCG) and calculated the integrated luminosity profiles in the $B$ and $V$ bands,
taking into account extinction, photometric and spatial completeness, K-correction and background
contribution. Then, by exploiting the spectroscopic sample we derived the stellar mass profiles
of the clusters. We got the luminosity profiles of 46 galaxy clusters, reaching $r_{200}$ in 30 cases,
and the stellar mass profiles of 42 of our objects. We successfully fitted all the integrated luminosity
growth profiles with one or two embedded S\'ersic components, deriving the main clusters parameters.
Finally, we checked the main scaling relation among the clusters parameters in comparison with
those obtained for a selected sample of early-type galaxies (ETGs) of the same clusters. We found
that the nearby galaxy clusters are non-homologous structures like ETGs and exhibit a color-magnitude
(CM) red-sequence relation very similar to that observed for galaxies in clusters. These properties
are not expected in the current cluster formation scenarios. In particular the existence of a CM
relation for clusters, shown here for the first time, suggests that the baryonic structures grow
and evolve in a similar way at all scales.
