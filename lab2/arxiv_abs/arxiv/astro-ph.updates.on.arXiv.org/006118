We present ALMA observations of the circumnuclear disk (CND) and the environment around Sgr A*.
The images unveil the presence of small spatial scale 12CO (J=3-2) molecular "cloudlets" within
the central parsec of the Milky Way and moving at high speeds, up to 300 km/s along the line-of-sight.
The 12CO-emitting structures show intricate morphologies: extended and filamentary at high-negative
velocities (v_LSR<-150 km/s), more localized and compact at extreme-positive velocities (v_LSR>+200
km/s). Based on the pencil-beam 12CO absorption spectrum toward Sgr A* synchrotron emission we
also present evidence for a diffuse molecular gas component producing absorption features at more
extreme-negative velocities (v_ LSR<-200 km/s). The CND shows a clumpy spatial distribution.
Its motion requires a bundle of non-uniformly rotating streams of slightly different inclinations.
The inferred gas density peaks, a few 10^5 cm-3, are lower than the local Roche limit, supporting
that the CND is a transient structure. We apply the two standard orbit models (spirals vs. ellipses)
invoked to explain the kinematics of the ionized gas streamers around Sgr A*. The location and velocities
of the extreme-velocity 12CO cloudlets |v_LSR|>200 km/s are inconsistent with the spiral model,
and only two of them are consistent with the Keplerian ellipse model. Most cloudlets, however, show
similar high velocities that are incompatible with the motion of the ionized streamers or with gas
bounded to the central gravity. We interpret them as the leftovers of massive molecular clouds that
fall into the cavity and are tidally disrupted and fragmented. These observations imply that molecular
cloudlets, all together with a mass of several 10 M_Sun, exist around Sgr A*. Most of them must be short-lived
(<10^4 yr): photoevaporated by the intense stellar radiation field or disrupted by strong gravitational
shears. (abridged)
