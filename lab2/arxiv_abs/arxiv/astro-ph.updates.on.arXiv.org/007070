This work investigates the alignment of galactic spins with the cosmic web across cosmic time using
the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Horizon-AGN. The cosmic web structure is extracted
via the persistent skeleton as implemented in the DISPERSE algorithm. It is found that the spin of
low-mass galaxies is more likely to be aligned with the filaments of the cosmic web and to lie within
the plane of the walls while more massive galaxies tend to have a spin perpendicular to the axis of
the filaments and to the walls. The mass transition is detected with a significance of 9 sigmas. This
galactic alignment is consistent with the alignment of the spin of dark haloes found in pure dark
matter simulations and with predictions from (anisotropic) tidal torque theory. However, unlike
haloes, the alignment of low-mass galaxies is weak and disappears at low redshifts while the orthogonal
spin orientation of massive galaxies is strong and increases with time, probably as a result of mergers.
At fixed mass, alignments are correlated with galaxy morphology: the high-redshift alignment
is dominated by spiral galaxies while elliptical centrals are mainly responsible for the perpendicular
signal. These predictions for spin alignments with respect to cosmic filaments and unprecendently
walls are successfully compared with existing observations. The alignment of the shape of galaxies
with the different components of the cosmic web is also investigated. A coherent and stronger signal
is found in terms of shape at high mass. The two regimes probed in this work induce competing galactic
alignment signals for weak lensing, with opposite redshift and luminosity evolution. Understanding
the details of these intrinsic alignments will be key to exploit future major cosmic shear surveys
like Euclid or LSST.
