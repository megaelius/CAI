We present constraints on Horndeski gravity from a combined analysis of cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy
lensing and galaxy clustering from $450\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) and
the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, including all cross-correlations. The Horndeski class
of dark energy/modified gravity models includes the majority of universally coupled extensions
to $\Lambda$CDM with one scalar degree of freedom in addition to the metric. We study the functions
of time that fully describe the evolution of linear perturbations in Horndeski gravity, and set
constraints on parameters that describe their time evolution. Our results are compatible throughout
with a $\Lambda$CDM model. Assuming proportionality of the Horndeski functions $\alpha_B$ and
$\alpha_M$ (describing the braiding of the scalar field with the metric and the Planck mass run rate,
respectively) to the dark energy density fraction $\Omega_{\mathrm{DE}}(a) = 1 - \Omega_{\mathrm{m}}(a)$,
we find for the proportionality coefficients $\hat{\alpha}_B = 0.20_{-0.33}^{+0.20} \,$ and
$\, \hat{\alpha}_M = 0.25_{-0.29}^{+0.19}$. Our value of $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.3}$
is in better agreement with the $Planck$ estimate when measured in the enlarged Horndeski parameter
space than in a pure $\Lambda$CDM scenario. In our Horndeski gravity analysis of cosmic shear alone,
we report a downward shift of the $S_8$ best fit value from the $Planck$ measurement of $\Delta S_8
= 0.048_{-0.056}^{+0.059}$, compared to $\Delta S_8 = 0.091_{-0.045}^{+0.046}$ in $\Lambda$CDM.
In the joint three-probe analysis, we find $\Delta S_8 = 0.016_{-0.046}^{+0.048}$ in Horndeski
gravity and $\Delta S_8 = 0.059_{-0.039}^{+0.040}$ in $\Lambda$CDM. Our likelihood code for multi-probe
analysis in both $\Lambda$CDM and Horndeski gravity is made publicly available.
