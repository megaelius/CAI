Multiple stellar populations are observed in almost all globular-clusters, but the origin of this
phenomenon is still debated. We investigate the role cool supergiants may have played. To do this,
we combine two investigative methods: state-of-the-art massive stellar evolution and calculations
of the hydrodynamic structure of the cluster-gas. This approach allows us to study how star-formation
in young massive clusters depends on the energy- and mass-input of the first-generation of stars,
while predicting the chemical composition of the second-generation. We find that the presence
of massive (9-500 M$_{\odot}$) metal-poor supergiants in the young cluster leads to a star-formation
episode within the first 4 Myr of the cluster's lifetime, that is, before the first core-collapse
supernovae explode or the gas is expelled. The stellar winds accumulate in the cluster center, forming
the second-generation there. Its composition is predicted to show variations in O & Na abundances,
consistently with observations. The abundance of helium is, similarly to other scenarios involving
massive stars, higher than what is referred from observations. Supposing dynamical removal of
stars from the outskirts of the cluster, or applying a top-heavy initial-mass-function, we can
predict a number ratio of the second-generation as high as 20-80%. The effect of metallicity is shown
to be important, as the most luminous supergiants are only predicted at low-metallicity, thus limiting
$-$ but not excluding $-$ the extent of a polluted second-generation at high-metallicity. These
massive stars becoming black-holes suggests globular-clusters hosting gravitational-wave
progenitors. Our scenario predicts a correlation between the mass of the cluster and the extent
of the multiple population phenomenon.
