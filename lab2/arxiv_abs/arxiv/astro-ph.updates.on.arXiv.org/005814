We present a determination of precise fundamental physical parameters of twenty detached, double-
lined, eclipsing binary stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) containing G- or early K-type
giant stars. Eleven are new systems, the remaining nine are systems already analyzed by our team
for which we present updated parameters. The catalogue results from our long-term survey of eclipsing
binaries in the Magellanic Clouds suitable for high-precision determination of distances (the
Araucaria project). The V-band brightnesses of the systems range from 15.4 mag to 17.7 mag and their
orbital periods range from 49 days to 773 days. Six systems have favorable geometry showing total
eclipses. The absolute dimensions of all eclipsing binary components are calculated with a precision
of better than 3% and all systems are suitable for a precise distance determination. The measured
stellar masses are in the range 1.4 to 4.6 M_sun and comparison with the MESA isochrones gives ages
between 0.1 and 2.1 Gyr. The systems show some weak age-metallicity relation. Two systems have components
with very different masses: OGLE LMC-ECL-05430 and OGLE LMC-ECL-18365. Neither system can be fitted
by single stellar evolution isochrone, explained by a past mass transfer scenario in the case of
ECL-18365 and a gravitational capture or a hierarchical binary merger scenario in the case of ECL-05430.
The longest period system OGLE LMC SC9 230659 shows a surprising apsidal motion which shifts the
apparent position of the eclipses. In one spectrum of OGLE LMC-ECL-12669 we noted a peculiar dimming
of one of the components by 65% well outside of the eclipses. We interpret this observation as arising
from an extremely rare occultation event as a foreground Galactic object covers only one component
of an extragalactic eclipsing binary.
