We analyse the properties of strongly barred disc galaxies using the TNG100 simulation, a cosmological
hydrodynamical realisation of the IllustrisTNG suite. We identify 270 disc galaxies at $z=0$ in
the stellar mass range $M_{*}=10^{10.4-11}M_{\odot}$, of which 40 per cent are barred. Of the detected
bars, more than half are strong. We find that the fraction of barred galaxies increases with stellar
mass, in agreement with observational results. Strongly barred galaxies exhibit, overall, lower
gas-to-stellar mass ratios compared to unbarred galaxies. The majority of barred galaxies are
quenched (sSFR $\sim10^{-11.7} $yr$^{-1}$), whereas unbarred galaxies continue to be active
(sSFR $\sim10^{-10.3}$yr$^{-1}$) on the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. We explore the
evolution of strongly barred and unbarred galaxies to investigate their formation and quenching
histories. We find that strong bars form between $0.5< z< 1.5$, with more massive galaxies hosting
older bars. Strong bars form in galaxies with an early-established prominent disc component, undergoing
periods of enhanced star formation and black hole accretion, possibly assisted by cosmological
inflows. Unbarred galaxies, on the other hand, assemble most of their mass and disc component at
late times. The nuclear region of strongly barred galaxies quenches shortly after bar formation,
while unbarred galaxies remain active across time. Our findings are indicative of bar quenching,
possibly assisted by nuclear feedback processes. We conclude that the cosmological environment,
together with small scale feedback processes, determine the chances of a galaxy to form a bar and
to rapidly quench its central region.
