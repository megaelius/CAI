Scanamorphos is public software initially developed to post-process scan observations performed
with the Herschel photometer arrays. This post-processing mainly consists in subtracting the
total low-frequency noise (both its thermal and non-thermal components), masking cosmic ray hits,
and projecting the data onto a map. Building upon the results obtained for P-ArT\'eMiS (the prototype
of ArT\'eMiS), Herschel and then NIKA2 (a resident camera of the IRAM 30-m telescope operating at
1.25 and 2 mm), it has now been tailored to the ArT\'eMiS camera, an ESO and OSO P.I. instrument installed
at the APEX 12-m telescope, demonstrating our initial claim that the software principles were directly
transposable to scan observations made with other instruments, including from the ground, provided
they entail sufficient redundancy. This document explains how the algorithm was modified to cope
with the specificities of ArT\'eMiS observations and with the atmospheric emission at 350 and 450
$\mu$m, far dominating the instrumental drifts that were the only low-frequency noise component
in Herschel data. Like in the original software, this was accomplished without assuming any noise
model and without applying any Fourier-space filtering, by exploiting the redundancy built in
the observations - taking advantage of the fact that each portion of the sky is sampled at multiple
times by multiple bolometers. It remains an interactive software in the sense that the user is allowed
to optionally visualize and control results at each intermediate step, but the processing is fully
automated. It has been grafted onto the ArT\'eMiS pipeline, in charge of the formatting, calibration
and projection of the data, that is described elsewhere.
