The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is the most extreme star-forming environment in the Milky Way in
terms of gas pressures, densities, temperatures, and dynamics. It acts as a critical test bed for
developing star formation theories applicable to the (high-redshift-like) conditions under
which most stars in the Universe formed. We present a set of numerical simulations of molecular clouds
orbiting on the 100-pc stream that dominates the molecular gas reservoir of the CMZ, with the goal
of characterising their morphological and kinematic evolution in response to the external gravitational
potential and their eccentric orbital motion. These simulations capture the evolution of single
clouds in a strong and plausibly dominant background potential. We find that the evolution of the
clouds is closely coupled to the orbital dynamics and their arrival on the 100-pc stream marks a transformative
event in their lifecycle. The clouds' sizes, aspect ratios, position angles, filamentary structure,
column densities, velocity dispersions, line-of-sight velocity gradients, angular momenta,
and overall kinematic complexity are controlled by the background potential and their passage
through the orbit's pericentre. We compare these predictions of our simulations to observations
of clouds on the Galactic Centre `dust ridge' and find that the inclusion of galactic dynamics naturally
reproduces a surprisingly wide variety of key observed morphological and kinematic features.
We argue that the accretion of gas clouds onto the central regions of galaxies, where the rotation
curve turns over and the tidal field becomes fully compressive, is likely to lead to their collapse
and associated star formation. This can generate an evolutionary progression of cloud collapse
with a common zero point. Together, these processes may naturally give rise to the synchronised
starbursts observed in numerous galactic nuclei.
