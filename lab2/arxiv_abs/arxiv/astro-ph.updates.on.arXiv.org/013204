Context: Solar-like protostars are known to be chemically rich, but it is not yet clear how much their
chemical composition can vary and why. So far, two chemically distinct types of Solar-like protostars
have been identified: hot corinos, which are enriched in interstellar Complex Organic Molecules
(iCOMs), such as methanol (CH$_3$OH) or dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$), and Warm Carbon Chain
Chemistry (WCCC) objects, which are enriched in carbon chain molecules, such as butadiynyl (C$_4$H)
or ethynyl radical (CCH). However, none of these have been studied so far in environments similar
to that in which our Sun was born, that is, one that is close to massive stars. Aims: In this work, we
search for hot corinos and WCCC objects in the closest analogue to the Sun's birth environment, the
Orion Molecular Cloud 2/3 (OMC-2/3) filament located in the Orion A molecular cloud. Methods: We
obtained single-dish observations of CCH and CH$_3$OH line emission towards nine Solar-like protostars
in this region. As in other, similar studies of late, we used the [CCH]/[CH$_3$OH] abundance ratio
in order to determine the chemical nature of our protostar sample. Results: Unexpectedly, we found
that the observed methanol and ethynyl radical emission (over a few thousands au scale) does not
seem to originate from the protostars but rather from the parental cloud and its photo-dissociation
region, illuminated by the OB stars of the region. Conclusions: Our results strongly suggest that
caution should be taken before using [CCH]/[CH$_3$OH] from single-dish observations as an indicator
of the protostellar chemical nature and that there is a need for other tracers or high angular resolution
observations for probing the inner protostellar layers.
