Episodic accretion plays an important role in the evolution of young stars. Although it has been
under investigation for a long time, the origin of such episodic accretion events is not yet understood.
We investigate the dust and gas emission of a sample of young outbursting sources in the infrared
to get a better understanding of their properties and circumstellar material, and we use the results
in a further work to model the objects. We used Herschel data, from our PI program of 12 objects and
complemented with archival observations to obtain the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and
spectra of our targets. We report here the main characteristics of our sample, focussing on the SED
properties and on the gas emission lines detected in the PACS and SPIRE spectra. The SEDs of our sample
show the diversity of the outbursting sources, with several targets showing strong emission in
the far-infrared from the embedded objects. Most of our targets reside in a complex environment,
which we discuss in detail. We detected several atomic and molecular lines, in particular rotational
CO emission from several transitions from J=38-37 to J=4-3. We constructed rotational diagrams
for the CO lines, and derived in three domains of assumed local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE)
temperatures and column densities, ranging mainly between 0-100 K and 400-500K. We confirm correlation
in our sample between intense CO $J=16-15$ emission and the column density of the warm domain of CO,
N(warm). We notice a strong increase in luminosity of HH 381 IRS and a weaker increase for PP 13 S, which
shows the beginning of an outburst.
