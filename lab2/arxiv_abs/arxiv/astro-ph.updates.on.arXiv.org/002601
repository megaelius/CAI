Following Paper I we investigate the properties of atmospheres that form around small protoplanets
embedded in a protoplanetary disc by conducting hydrodynamical simulations. These are now extended
to three dimensions, employing a spherical grid centred on the planet. Compression of gas is shown
to reduce rotational motions. Contrasting the 2D case, no clear boundary demarcates bound atmospheric
gas from disc material; instead, we find an open system where gas enters the Bondi sphere at high latitudes
and leaves through the midplane regions, or, vice versa, when the disc gas rotates sub-Keplerian.
The simulations do not converge to a time-independent solution; instead, the atmosphere is characterized
by a time-varying velocity field. Of particular interest is the timescale to replenish the atmosphere
by nebular gas, $t_\mathrm{replenish}$. It is shown that the replenishment rate, $M_\mathrm{atm}/t_\mathrm{replenish}$,
can be understood in terms of a modified Bondi accretion rate, $\sim$$R_\mathrm{Bondi}^2\rho_\mathrm{gas}v_\mathrm{Bondi}$,
where $v_\mathrm{Bondi}$ is set by the Keplerian shear or the magnitude of the sub-Keplerian motion
of the gas, whichever is larger. In the inner disk, the atmosphere of embedded protoplanets replenishes
on a timescale that is shorter than the Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction (or cooling) timescale. As
a result, atmospheric gas can no longer contract and the growth of these atmospheres terminates.
Future work must confirm whether these findings continue to apply when the (thermodynamical) idealizations
employed in this study are relaxed. But if shown to be broadly applicable, replenishment of atmospheric
gas provides a natural explanation for the preponderance of gas-rich but rock-dominant planets
like super-Earths and mini-Neptunes.
