The reionization of cosmic hydrogen marks a critical juncture in the history of structure formation
in the universe. Here we present a new formulation of the standard reionization equation for the
evolution of the volume-averaged HII fraction that is more consistent with the accepted conceptual
model of inhomogeneous intergalactic absorption. The revised equation retains the basic terminology
and simplicity of the classic calculation but explicitly accounts for the presence of the optically
thick "Lyman-limit systems" that are known to determine the mean free path of ionizing radiation
after overlap. Integration of this equation provides a better characterization of the timing of
reionization by smoothly linking the pre-overlap with the post-overlap phases of such process.
We confirm the validity of the quasi-instantaneous approximation as predictor of reionization
completion/maintenance, and discuss new insights on the sources of cosmic reionization using
the improved formalism. A constant emission rate into the intergalactic medium (IGM) of 3 Lyman
continuum (LyC) photons per atom per Gyr leads to a reionization history that is consistent with
a number of observational constraints on the ionization state of the z=5-9 universe and with the
reduced Thomson scattering optical depth recently reported by the Planck Collaboration. While
star-forming galaxies can dominate the reionization process if the luminosity-weighted fraction
of LyC photons that escape into the IGM, f_esc, exceeds 15% (for a faint magnitude cut-off of the galaxy
UV luminosity function of M_lim=-13 and a LyC photon yield per unit 1500 AA luminosity of xi_ion=10^{25.3}
Hz/erg, simple models where the product of the two unknowns f_esc xi_ion is not evolving with redshift
fail to reproduce the changing neutrality of the IGM observed at these epochs.
