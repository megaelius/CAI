Deep Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) imaging of the most powerful lensing clusters provides access
to the most magnified distant galaxies. It is a challenge to construct lens models capable of describing
these complex massive, merging clusters so that the intrinsic source properties can be meaningfully
derived. Here we apply our general free-form lensing method (WSLAP+) to A2744, providing a model
independent map of the cluster magnification and geometric distance estimates to multiply-lensed
sources. We solve simultaneously for a smooth cluster component on a pixel grid, together with local
deflections by the observed member galaxies. Our solution is sufficiently accurate to securely
identify 18 multiply-lensed systems behind A2744 totaling 56 images, spanning 1.0<z<7.5.
Our model corrects and complete several systems recently claimed using the same data. The reconstructed
mass shows a small enhancement in the direction where significant amounts of hot plasma can be seen
in X-rays. We compare photometric redshift estimates with "geometric redshifts", derived from
the relative angles between the multiple images, finding tight agreement and consistency with
the standard cosmological parameters. Predicted and observed magnitudes were found to agree with
each other in general, but further refinement in the lens model is required such that the magnification
can be accurately corrected. Intriguingly, no multiply-lensed galaxy is detected beyond z=7.5,
despite the high magnification and the limiting redshift of z=11.5 permitted by the HFF filters.
With the additional HFF clusters we can better examine the plausibility of any pronounced high-z
deficit, averaging over clustering noise, with potentially important implications for the epoch
of reionization and the nature of dark matter.
