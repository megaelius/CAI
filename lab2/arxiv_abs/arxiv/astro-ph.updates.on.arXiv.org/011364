Context: White Dwarfs (WDs) are important and abundant tools to study the structure and evolution
of the Galactic environment. However, the multiplicity of WD progenitors is generally neglected.
Specifically, a merger in a binary systems can lead to a single WD, which could result in wrongly inferred
quantities if only single stellar evolution (SE) is considered. These mergers are linked to transients
such as luminous red novae and Type Ia supernovae. Aims: We investigate the impact of binary evolution
(BE) upon observable single WDs, and compare their properties to WDs formed through SE. We assess
the evolutionary channels, as well as age and mass distributions of the resulting single WDs. Methods:
We employ SeBa to model the evolution of single star and binary populations. We synthesize the observable
single WD population within $100$ pc, including cooling and observational selection effects.
Additionally, we construct models with different evolution and primordial population properties
to study the effects on the properties of the resulting single WDs. Results: WDs from binary mergers
make up about $10-30\%$ of all observable single WDs, and $30-50\%$ of massive WDs. On average, individual
WDs take $3.1-5$ times longer to form through BE than SE, and so appear ${\sim} 1$ Gyr younger than
they are if BE is ignored. In all models, the effect of mergers on the age distribution is clearly noticeable.
The median age typically increases by $85-430$ Myr, and $200-390$ Myr for massive WDs. Although
abundant, we do not find evidence that WDs from mergers significantly alter the shape of the WD mass
distribution. Conclusions: Assuming single stellar evolution for inferring properties of single
WDs gives rise to intrinsic errors as single WDs can also be formed following a binary merger. Strategies
for mitigating the effect of mergers on the WD age distributions are discussed.
