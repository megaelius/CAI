Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) are a promising probe of the large-scale structure at high redshift,
$z\gtrsim 2$. In particular, the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment aims at observing
LAEs at 1.9 $<z<$ 3.5 to measure the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale and the Redshift-Space
Distortion (RSD). However, Zheng et al. (2011) pointed out that the complicated radiative transfer
(RT) of the resonant Lyman-$\alpha$ emission line generates an anisotropic selection bias in the
LAE clustering on large scales, $s\gtrsim 10$ Mpc. This effect could potentially induce a systematic
error in the BAO and RSD measurements. Also, Croft et al. (2016) claims an observational evidence
of the effect in the Lyman-$\alpha$ intensity map, albeit statistically insignificant. We aim
at quantifying the impact of the Lyman-$\alpha$ RT on the large-scale galaxy clustering in detail.
For this purpose, we study the correlations between the large-scale environment and the ratio of
an apparent Lyman-$\alpha$ luminosity to an intrinsic one, which we call the `observed fraction',
at $2<z<6$. We apply our Lyman-$\alpha$ RT code by post-processing the full Illustris simulations.
We simply assume that the intrinsic luminosity of the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission is proportional
to the star formation rate of galaxies in Illustris, yielding a sufficiently large sample of LAEs
to measure the anisotropic selection bias. We find little correlations between large-scale environment
and the observed fraction induced by the RT, and hence a smaller anisotropic selection bias than
what was claimed by Zheng et al. (2011). We argue that the anisotropy was overestimated in the previous
work due to the insufficient spatial resolution: it is important to keep the resolution such that
it resolves the high density region down to the scale of the interstellar medium, $\sim1$ physical
kpc. (abridged)
