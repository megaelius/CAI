The most general case of self-induced neutrino flavor evolution is described by a set of kinetic
equations for a dense neutrino gas evolving both in space and time. Solutions of these equations
have been typically worked out assuming that either the time (in the core-collapse supernova environment)
or space (in the early universe) homogeneity in the initial conditions is preserved through the
evolution. In these cases one can gauge away the homogeneous variable and reduce the dimensionality
of the problem. In this paper we investigate if small deviations from an initial postulated homogeneity
can be amplified by the interacting neutrino gas, leading to a new flavor instability. To this end,
we consider a simple two flavor isotropic neutrino gas evolving in time, and initially composed
by only $\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_e$ with equal densities. In the homogeneous case, this system shows
a bimodal instability in the inverted mass hierarchy scheme, leading to the well studied flavor
pendulum behavior. This would lead to periodic pair conversions $\nu_e \bar\nu_e \leftrightarrow
\nu_x \bar\nu_x$. To break space homogeneity, we introduce small amplitude space-dependent perturbations
in the matter potential. By Fourier transforming the equations of motion with respect to the space
coordinate, we then numerically solve a set of coupled equations for the different Fourier modes.
We find that even for arbitrarily tiny inhomogeneities, the system evolution runs away from the
stable pendulum behavior: the different modes are excited and the system evolves towards flavor
equilibrium. We finally comment on the role of a time decaying neutrino background density in weakening
these results.
