Understanding the nature of dark energy is one of the most outstanding problems in cosmology at present.
In last twenty years, cosmological observations related to SNIa, Cosmic Microwave Background
Radiation, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations etc, have put stringent constraints on the the dark energy
evolution, still there is enough uncertainty in our knowledge about dark energy that demands new
generation of cosmological observations. Post-reionization neutral hydrogen 21 cm intensity
mapping surveys are one of the most promising future cosmological observations that have the potential
to map the cosmological evolution from dark ages till present time with unprecedented accuracy
and Square Kilometer Array (SKA) is one of the most sensitive instruments to measure the post-reionization
21 cm signal. In this work, we study the future dark energy constraints using post-reionization
21 cm intensity mapping power spectra with SKA1-mid specifications. We use three different parametrizations
for dark energy equation of state (EoS) including the widely used CPL one. To generate simulated
data, we use to two fiducial models: the concordance $\Lambda$CDM and the best fit CPL model for Planck+SNIa+BAO+HST.
Our study shows that SKA1-mid alone has the potential to reach the present accuracy for combined
Planck+SNIa+BAO+HST to constrain the dark energy behaviour. Whether dark energy is phantom or
non-phantom or whether it exhibits phantom crossing, we may potentially address such questions
with SKA1-mid. We also show that it is crucial to choose the correct parametrization for dark energy
equation of state as some parametrizations are better than others to constrain the dark energy behaviour.
Specifically, as observed in this study, the widely used CPL parametrization may not give the best
constraint for dark energy behaviour.
