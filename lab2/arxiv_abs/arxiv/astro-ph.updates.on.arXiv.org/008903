Locating the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) still remains a difficult puzzle
for modern astrophysics. A major hurdle in the search for the sources is the fact that UHECRs are deflected
by the Galactic magnetic field (GMF). Current knowledge of the GMF is limited, as most experimental
measurements track line-of-sight--integrated quantities that are used to obtain best-fit parameters
for global models including a large random component. The advent, however, of the Gaia era, with
measurements of $\sim 10^9$ stellar parallaxes, in combination with upcoming large polarimetric
surveys, make, for the first time, a 3D measurement of the GMF possible in principle. Such measurements
can then be used to attempt a reconstruction of the trajectories of individual UHECRs through the
Galaxy, in order to correct for their deflection. Motivated by these developments, in the present
work, we study the limits of such a correction, by examining how its effectiveness depends on the
uncertainty of any such future magnetic field measurements. To that end, we simulate attempts to
reconstruct the trajectory of the cosmic ray by using hypothetical measurements of the GMF, based
on values received from two recently updated GMF models. To simulate the uncertainty of a 3D measurement,
random errors to these values are introduced separately for the plane-of-the-sky (POS) magnitude,
the line-of-sight (LOS) magnitude and the POS direction. Our results highlight the conditions
under which an effective correction is achievable. We find that the effectiveness is dependent
on the particle rigidity and arrival direction, and can vary significantly depending on the GMF
model used.
