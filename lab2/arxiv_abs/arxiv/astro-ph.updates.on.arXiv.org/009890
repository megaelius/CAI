We present improved mass models of three CLASH/HFF massive clusters, MACS J1206.2-0847, MACS J0416.1-0403,
Abell S1063. We reconstruct the subhalo mass component with robust stellar kinematics of cluster
galaxies, coupled with precise strong lensing models from large samples of spectroscopically
confirmed multiple images. We use VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy in the cluster cores to
measure the stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma$ of 40-60 member galaxies per cluster, covering
4-5 magnitudes to $m_{F160W}\simeq 21.5$. We test the accuracy of velocity dispersion measurements
on mock spectra, thus quantifying the limiting signal-to-noise and minimum velocity ($\sigma>80$\,\vel)
for the depth of the spectra presented here. With these data, we determine the normalization and
slope of the Faber-Jackson relation in each cluster and use it a prior for the scaling relations of
the sub-halo population in the lensing mass models. Compared to our previous lens models, the inclusion
of stellar kinematics yields a similar precision in the predicted positions of the multiple images.
However, the inherent degeneracy between the central effective velocity dispersion, $\sigma_0$,
and truncation radius, $r_{cut}$, of subhalos is strongly reduced, significantly alleviating
systematics in the measurements of subhalo masses. The three independent determinations of the
$\sigma_0\mbox{-}r_{cut}$ relation in each cluster are fully consistent, enabling a statistical
determination of subhalo sizes at given $\sigma_0$ or mass. Finally, we derive the galaxy central
velocity dispersion functions of the three clusters projected within 16\% of their virial radii,
finding that they are well in agreement with each other. This methodology, when applied to high-quality
kinematics and strong lensing data, allows the subhalo mass functions to be determined and compared
with predictions from cosmological simulations.
