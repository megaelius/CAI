Hydrodynamical instabilities in disks around young stars depend on the thermodynamic stratification
of the disk and on the local rate of thermal relaxation. Here, we map the spatial extent of unstable
regions for the Vertical Shear Instability (VSI), the Convective OverStability (COS), and the
amplification of vortices via the Subcritical Baroclinic Instability (SBI). We use steady state
accretion disk models, including stellar irradiation, accretion heating and radiative transfer.
We determine the local radial and vertical stratification and thermal relaxation rate in the disk,
in dependence of the stellar mass, disk mass and mass accretion rate. We find that passive regions
of disks - i.e. the midplane temperature dominated by irradiation - are COS unstable about one pressure
scale height above the midplane and VSI unstable at radii $> 10 \, \text{au}$. Vortex amplification
via SBI should operate in most parts of active and passive disks. For active parts of disks (midplane
temperature determined by accretion power) COS can become active down to the midplane. Same is true
for the VSI because of the vertically adiabatic stratification of an internally heated disk. If
hydro instabilities or other non-ideal MHD processes are able to create $\alpha$-stresses ($>
10^{-5}$) and released accretion energy leads to internal heating of the disk, hydrodynamical
instabilities are likely to operate in significant parts of the planet forming zones in disks around
young stars, driving gas accretion and flow structure formation. Thus hydro-instabilities are
viable candidates to explain the rings and vortices observed with ALMA and VLT.
