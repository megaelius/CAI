Rapid advancement in the observation of cosmic strings has been made in recent years placing increasingly
stringent constraints on their properties, with $G\mu\lesssim 10^{-11}$ from Pulsar Timing Array
(PTA). Cosmic string loops with low string tension clump in the Galaxy due to slow loop decay and low
gravitational recoil, resulting in great enhancement to loop abundance in the Galaxy. With an average
separation of down to just a fraction of a kpc, and the total power of gravitational wave (GW) emission
dominated by harmonic modes spanning a wide angular scale, resolved loops located in proximity
are powerful, persistent, and highly monochromatic sources of GW with a harmonic signature not
replicated by any other sources, making them prime targets for direct detection by the upcoming
Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), whose frequency range is well-matched. Unlike detection
of bursts where the detection rate scales with loop abundance, the detection rate for harmonic signal
is the result of a complex interplay between the strength of GW emission, loop abundance, and other
sources of noise, and is most suitably studied through numerical simulations. We develop a robust
and flexible framework for simulating loops in the Galaxy for predicting direct detection of harmonic
signal from resolved loops by LISA. Our simulation reveals that the most accessible region in the
parameter space consists of large loops $\alpha=0.1$ with low tension $10^{-21}\lesssim G\mu\lesssim
10^{-19}$. Direct detection of field theory cosmic strings is unlikely, with the detection probability
$p_{\mathrm{det}}\lesssim 2\%$ for a 1-year mission. An extension suggests that direct detection
of cosmic superstrings with a low intercommutation probability is very promising. Searching for
harmonic GW signal from resolved loops through LISA observations will potentially place physical
constraints on string theory.
