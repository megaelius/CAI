[abridged] Demographic surveys of protoplanetary disks, mainly with ALMA, have provided access
to a large range of disk dust masses ($M_{\rm{dust}}$) around stars with different stellar types
and for different star-forming regions. These surveys found a linear relation in logarithmic scale
between $M_{\rm{dust}}$ and $M_{\star}$ that steepens with time, but that is flatter for transition
disks (TDs). We perform dust evolution models and include perturbations to the gas surface density
with different amplitudes to investigate the effect of particle trapping on the $M_{\rm{dust}}-M_{\star}$
relation. These perturbations aim to mimic pressure bumps originated by planets. We focus on the
effect caused by different stellar and disk masses because exoplanet statistics show a dependence
of planet mass with stellar mass and metallicity. We find that models of dust evolution can reproduced
the observed $M_{\rm{dust}}-M_{\star}$ relation in different star-forming regions when strong
pressure bumps are included and when the disk mass scales with stellar mass (case of $M_{\rm{disk}}=0.05\,M_\star$
in our models). This result arises from dust trapping and dust growth beyond centimeter-size grains
inside pressure bumps. However, the flatter relation of $M_{\rm{dust}}-M_{\star}$ for TDs and
disks with substructures cannot be reproduced by the models, unless the formation of boulders is
inhibited inside pressure bumps. In the context of planets originating pressure bumps, our results
agree with the current exoplanet statistics about giant planet occurrence increasing with stellar
mass, but we cannot conclude about the type of planets needed in the case of low mass stars. This is
because for $M_\star<1\,M_\odot$, the observed $M_{\rm{dust}}$ obtained from models is very
low due to the efficient growth of dust particles beyond centimeter sizes (boulders) inside pressure
bumps.
