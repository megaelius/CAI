Sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs accreting a helium shell on a carbon-oxygen core are potential
progenitors of normal Type Ia supernovae. This work focuses on the details of the onset of the carbon
detonation in the double detonation sub-Chandrasekhar model. In order to simulate the influence
of core-shell mixing on the carbon ignition mechanism, the helium shell and its detonation are followed
with an increased resolution compared to the rest of the star treating the propagation of the detonation
wave more accurately. This significantly improves the predictions of the nucleosynthetic yields
from the helium burning. The simulations were carried out with the AREPO code. A carbon-oxygen core
with a helium shell was set up in one dimension and mapped to three dimensions. We ensured the stability
of the white dwarf with a relaxation step before the hydrodynamic detonation simulation started.
Synthetic observables were calculated with the radiative transfer code ARTIS. An ignition mechanism
of the carbon detonation was observed, which received little attention before. In this "scissors
mechanism", the impact the helium detonation wave has on unburnt material when converging opposite
to its ignition spot is strong enough to ignite a carbon detonation. This is possible in a carbon enriched
transition region between the core and shell. The detonation mechanism is found to be sensitive
to details of the core-shell transition and our models illustrate the need to consider core-shell
mixing taking place during the accretion process. Even though the detonation ignition mechanism
differs form the converging shock mechanism, the differences in the synthetic observables are
not significant. Though they do not fit observations better than previous simulations, they illustrate
the need for multi-dimensional simulations.
