Galaxy morphology is a fundamental quantity, that is essential not only for the full spectrum of
galaxy-evolution studies, but also for a plethora of science in observational cosmology. While
a rich literature exists on morphological-classification techniques, the unprecedented data
volumes, coupled, in some cases, with the short cadences of forthcoming 'Big-Data' surveys (e.g.
from the LSST), present novel challenges for this field. Large data volumes make such datasets intractable
for visual inspection (even via massively-distributed platforms like Galaxy Zoo), while short
cadences make it difficult to employ techniques like supervised machine-learning, since it may
be impractical to repeatedly produce training sets on short timescales. Unsupervised machine
learning, which does not require training sets, is ideally suited to the morphological analysis
of new and forthcoming surveys. Here, we employ an algorithm that performs clustering of graph representations,
in order to group image patches with similar visual properties and objects constructed from those
patches, like galaxies. We implement the algorithm on the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Subaru-Strategic-Program
Ultra-Deep survey, to autonomously reduce the galaxy population to a small number (160) of 'morphological
clusters', populated by galaxies with similar morphologies, which are then benchmarked using
visual inspection. The morphological classifications (which we release publicly) exhibit a high
level of purity, and reproduce known trends in key galaxy properties as a function of morphological
type at z<1 (e.g. stellar-mass functions, rest-frame colours and the position of galaxies on the
star-formation main sequence). Our study demonstrates the power of unsupervised machine learning
in performing accurate morphological analysis, which will become indispensable in this new era
of deep-wide surveys.
