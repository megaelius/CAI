We currently know about 30 magnetars: seemingly isolated neutron stars whose properties can be
(in part) comprehended only acknowledging that they are endowed with magnetic fields of complex
morphology and exceptional intensity-at least in some components of the field structure. Although
magnetars represent only a small percentage of the known isolated neutron stars, there are almost
certainly many more of them, since most magnetars were discovered in transitory phases called outbursts,
during which they are particularly noticeable. In outburst, in fact, a magnetar can be brighter
in X-rays by orders of magnitude and usually emit powerful bursts of hard-X/soft-gamma-ray photons
that can be detected almost everywhere in the Galaxy with all-sky monitors such as those on board
the Fermi satellite or the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Magnetars command great attention because
the large progress that has been made in their understanding is proving fundamental to fathom the
whole population of isolated neutron stars, and because, due to their extreme properties, they
are relevant for a vast range of different astrophysical topics, from the study of gamma-ray bursts
and superluminous supernovae, to ultraluminous X-ray sources, fast radio bursts, and even to sources
of gravitational waves. Several excellent reviews with different focuses were published on magnetars
in the last few years: among others, Israel and Dall'Osso (2011); Rea and Esposito (2011); Turolla
and Esposito (2013); Mereghetti et al. (2015); Turolla et al. (2015); Kaspi and Beloborodov (2017).
Here, we quickly recall the history of these sources and travel through the main observational facts,
trying to touch some recent and sometimes little-discussed ramifications of magnetars.
