Following the recent identification of the prototypical short GRB 090227B originating from a binary
neutron star (NS) merger and forming a black hole (BH), we present here a new example of such sources,
GRB 140619B. The time-resolved spectral analysis of the early ~0.2s of the Fermi-GBM data, allows
for the identification of the characteristic features of the e^+e^- plasma at transparency (P-GRB):
i.e., a thermal spectrum with an observed temperature kT=(324+/-33)keV which represents ~40%
of the total source fluence. The subsequent emission, with no thermal spectrum, is identified with
the prompt emission. We consequently deduce a theoretical redshift of z=2.67+/-0.37, a total burst
energy E+/-=(6.03+/-0.79)x10^{52}erg, a baryon load B=(5.52+/-0.73)x10^{-5}, and a Lorentz
factor at transparency Gamma=(1.08+/-0.08)x10^4. From the simulation of the prompt emission
we determine the average density of the circumburst medium (CBM), n_CBM=(4.7+/-1.2)x10^{-5}cm^{-3},
typical of the galactic halo environment. These low CBM density and baryon load, confirm the identification
of the GRB progenitor as a NS-NS merger. By assuming symmetric NS masses (M_NS=1.34Msun), the inferred
baryon load corresponds to ~3% of the total crustal mass, i.e. M_2c=7.26x10^{-5}Msun. The corresponding
emission of gravitational waves, in the inspiral phase up to the merger, corresponds to 7.42x10^{52}erg.
We also show that the gravitational waves signal from this NS binary progenitor, in view of the large
cosmological distance, is undetectable by the Advanced LIGO. Novel is the presence of an observed
emission at energies >0.1 GeV lasting ~5s, with a total energy of E_LAT=(2.02+/-0.52)x10^{53}erg.
We estimate the energy requirements of E_LAT in terms of accretion of a fraction of M_2c on the BH.
From GRBs 090227B and 140619B, we estimate the rate of such short GRBs to be 1.7(+3.7)(-1.4)x10^{-4}/(Gpc^3yr).
