We investigate how the scaling relations between central black hole mass (Mbh) and host galaxy properties
(velocity dispersion, bulge stellar mass and bulge luminosity) depend on the large scale environment.
For each of a sample of 69 galaxies with dynamical black hole measurements we compile four environmental
measures (nearest neighbor distance, fixed aperture number density, total halo mass, and central/satellite).
We find that central and satellite galaxies follow distinctly separate scalings in each of the three
relations we have examined. The Mbh - sigma relation of central galaxies is significantly steeper
(6.38 +/- 0.49) than that of satellite galaxies (4.91 +/- 0.49), but has a similar intercept. This
behavior remains even after restricting to a sample of only early type galaxies or after removing
the 8 brightest cluster galaxies. The Mbh - sigma relation shows more modest differences when splitting
the sample based on the other environmental indicators, suggesting that they are driven by the underlying
satellite/central fractions. Separate relations for centrals and satellites are also seen in
the power law scaling between black hole mass and bulge stellar mass or bulge luminosity. We suggest
that gas rich, low mass galaxies undergo a period of rapid black hole growth in the process of becoming
satellites. If central galaxies on the current Mbh - sigma relation are representative progenitors
of the satellite population, the observations imply that a sigma = 120 km/s galaxy must nearly triple
its central black hole mass. The elevated black hole masses of massive central galaxies are then
a natural consequence of the accretion of satellites.
