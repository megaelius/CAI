Magnetic star-planet interactions (SPI) provide a detection method and insight into exoplanet
magnetic fields and, in turn, exoplanet interiors and atmospheric environments. These signatures
can be sporadic and difficult to confirm for single-epoch observations of a system due to inhomogeneous
stellar magnetospheres and periodic variability in stellar magnetism. Thus an ideal SPI search
consists of multiple epochs containing observations on consecutive nights spanning at least one
complete planetary orbit. Such data sets are rare but do exist for some of the most intensely studied
hot Jupiter systems. One such system is HD 189733 for which six suitable SPI data sets exist, the result
of spectroscopic monitoring to perform some of the first SPI searches and also to study the star's
magnetic field. Here we perform a uniform analysis of six archival Ca II K data sets for HD 189733,
spanning 2006 June through 2015 July, in order to search for magnetic SPI signatures in the chromospheric
line variations. We find significant evidence for modulations of Ca II K with a $2.29\pm0.04$ day
period in the 2013 August data, which is consistent with the planet's orbital period. The peak in
the orbital variations occurs at $\phi_\text{orb} \approx 0.9$, which corresponds to the SPI emission
leading the planet with a phase difference of $\Delta\phi \approx 40^\circ$ from the sub-planetary
point. This is consistent with the phase lead predictions of non-linear force-free magnetic field
SPI models. The stellar magnetic field strength at the planet's orbit is greatest in 2013 August
which, due to the energy released in magnetic SPI scaling with $B_*$, lends strength to the SPI interpretation.
