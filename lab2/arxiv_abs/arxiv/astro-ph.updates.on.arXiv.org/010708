Context. The origin of water in the stratospheres of Giant Planets has been an outstanding question
ever since its first detection by ISO some 20 years ago. Water can originate from interplanetary
dust particles, icy rings and satellites and large comet impacts. Analysis of Herschel Space Observatory
observations have proven that the bulk of Jupiter's stratospheric water was delivered by the Shoemaker-Levy
9 impacts in 1994. In 2006, the Cassini mission detected water plumes at the South Pole of Enceladus,
placing the moon as a serious candidate for Saturn's stratospheric water. Further evidence was
found in 2011, when Herschel demonstrated the presence of a water torus at the orbital distance of
Enceladus, fed by the moon's plumes. Finally, water falling from the rings onto Saturn's uppermost
atmospheric layers at low latitudes was detected during the final orbits of Cassini's end-of-mission
plunge into the atmosphere. Aims. In this paper, we use Herschel mapping observations of water in
Saturn's stratosphere to identify its source. Methods. Several empirical models are tested against
the Herschel-HIFI and -PACS observations, which were collected on December 30, 2010, and January
2nd, 2011 (respectively). Results. We demonstrate that Saturn's stratospheric water is not uniformly
mixed as a function of latitude, but peaking at the equator and decreasing poleward with a Gaussian
distribution. We obtain our best fit with an equatorial mole fraction 1.1 ppb and a half-width at
half-maximum of 25{\deg}, when accounting for a temperature increase in the two warm stratospheric
vortices produced by Saturn's Great Storm of 2010-2011. Conclusions. This work demonstrates that
Enceladus is the main source of Saturn's stratospheric water.
