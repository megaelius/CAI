We present a search for helium in the upper atmospheres of three sub-Neptune size planets to investigate
the origins of these ubiquitous objects. The detection of helium for a low density planet would be
strong evidence for the presence of a primary atmosphere accreted from the protoplanetary nebula
because large amounts of helium are not expected in the secondary atmospheres of rocky planets.
We used Keck+NIRSPEC to obtain high-resolution transit spectroscopy of the planets GJ1214b, GJ9827d,
and HD97658b around the 10,833 Ang He triplet feature. We did not detect helium absorption for any
of the planets despite achieving a high level of sensitivity. We used the non-detections to set limits
on the planets' thermosphere temperatures and atmospheric loss rates by comparing grids of 1D models
to the data. We also performed coupled interior structure and atmospheric loss calculations, which
suggest that the bulk atmospheres (winds) of the planets would be at most modestly enhanced (depleted)
in helium relative to their primordial composition. Our lack of detections of the helium triplet
for GJ1214b and GJ9827d are inconsistent with the predictions of models for the present day mass
loss on these planets at more than 5 sigma confidence. Higher signal-to-noise data would be needed
to detect the helium feature predicted for HD97658b. We identify uncertainties in the EUV fluxes
of the host stars and the lack of detailed mass loss models specifically for cool and metal-enhanced
atmospheres as the main limitations to the interpretation of our results. Ultimately, our results
suggest that the upper atmospheres of sub-Neptune planets are fundamentally different than those
of gas giant planets.
