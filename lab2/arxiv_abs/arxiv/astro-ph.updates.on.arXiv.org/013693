We use a compilation of disc galaxy rotation curves to assess the role of the luminous component ("baryons")
in the rotation curve diversity problem. As in earlier work, we find that rotation curve shape correlates
with baryonic surface density: high surface density galaxies have rapidly-rising rotation curves
consistent with cuspy cold dark matter halos; slowly-rising rotation curves (characteristic
of galaxies with inner mass deficits or "cores") occur only in low surface density galaxies. The
correlation, however, seems too weak to be the main driver of the diversity. In addition, dwarf galaxies
exhibit a clear trend, from "cuspy" systems where baryons are unimportant in the inner mass budget
to "cored" galaxies where baryons actually dominate. This trend constrains the various scenarios
proposed to explain the diversity, such as (i) baryonic inflows and outflows during galaxy formation;
(ii) dark matter self-interactions; (iii) variations in the baryonic mass structure coupled to
rotation velocities through the "mass discrepancy-acceleration relation" (MDAR); or (iv) non-circular
motions in gaseous discs. Together with analytical modeling and cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations, our analysis shows that each of these scenarios has promising features, but none seems
to fully account for the observed diversity. The MDAR, in particular, is inconsistent with the observed
trend between rotation curve shape and baryonic importance; either the trend is caused by systematic
errors in the data or the MDAR does not apply. The origin of the dwarf galaxy rotation curve diversity
and its relation to the structure of cold dark matter halos remains an open issue.
