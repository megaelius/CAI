Modeling the Point Spread Function (PSF) of wide-field surveys is vital for many astrophysical
applications and cosmological probes including weak gravitational lensing. The PSF smears the
image of any recorded object and therefore needs to be taken into account when inferring properties
of galaxies from astronomical images. In the case of cosmic shear, the PSF is one of the dominant sources
of systematic errors and must be treated carefully to avoid biases in cosmological parameters.
Recently, forward modeling approaches to calibrate shear measurements within the Monte-Carlo
Control Loops ($MCCL$) framework have been developed. These methods typically require simulating
a large amount of wide-field images, thus, the simulations need to be very fast yet have realistic
properties in key features such as the PSF pattern. Hence, such forward modeling approaches require
a very flexible PSF model, which is quick to evaluate and whose parameters can be estimated reliably
from survey data. We present a PSF model that meets these requirements based on a fast deep-learning
method to estimate its free parameters. We demonstrate our approach on publicly available SDSS
data. We extract the most important features of the SDSS sample via principal component analysis.
Next, we construct our model based on perturbations of a fixed base profile, ensuring that it captures
these features. We then train a Convolutional Neural Network to estimate the free parameters of
the model from noisy images of the PSF. This allows us to render a model image of each star, which we
compare to the SDSS stars to evaluate the performance of our method. We find that our approach is able
to accurately reproduce the SDSS PSF at the pixel level, which, due to the speed of both the model evaluation
and the parameter estimation, offers good prospects for incorporating our method into the $MCCL$
framework.
