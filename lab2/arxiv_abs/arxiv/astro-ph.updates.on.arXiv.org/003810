This paper shows how the dips and secular dimming in the KIC8462852 light curve can originate in circumstellar
material distributed around a single elliptical orbit (e.g., exocomets). The expected thermal
emission and wavelength dependent dimming is derived for different orbital parameters and geometries,
including dust that is optically thick to stellar radiation, and for a size distribution of dust
with realistic optical properties. We first consider dust distributed evenly around the orbit,
then show how to derive its uneven distribution from the optical light curve and to predict light
curves at different wavelengths. The fractional luminosity of an even distribution is approximately
the level of dimming times stellar radius divided by distance from the star at transit. Non-detection
of dust thermal emission for KIC8462852 thus provides a lower limit on the transit distance to complement
the 0.6au upper limit imposed by 0.4day dips. Unless the dust distribution is optically thick, the
putative 16% century-long secular dimming must have disappeared before the WISE 12micron measurement
in 2010, and subsequent 4.5micron observations require transits at >0.05au. However, self-absorption
of thermal emission removes these constraints for opaque dust distributions. The passage of dust
clumps through pericentre is predicted to cause infrared brightening lasting 10s of days and dimming
during transit, such that total flux received decreases at wavelengths <5micron, but increases
to potentially detectable levels at longer wavelengths. We suggest that lower dimming levels than
seen for KIC8462852 are more common in the Galactic population and may be detected in future transit
surveys.
