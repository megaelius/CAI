The MASER (Measurements, Analysis, and Simulation of Emission in the Radio range) project provides
a comprehensive infrastructure dedicated to low frequency radio emissions (typically below 50
to 100 MHz). The main radio sources observed in this frequency are the Earth, the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn,
and our Galaxy. They are observed either from ground (down to 10 MHz) or from space. Ground observatories
are more sensitive than space observatories and capture high resolution data streams (up to a few
TB per day for modern instruments). Conversely, space-borne instruments can observe below the
ionospheric cut-off (10 MHz) and can be placed closer to the studied object. Several tools have been
developed in the last decade for sharing space physics data. Data visualization tools developed
by, e.g., The CDPP (this http URL, Centre de Donn\'ees de la Physique des Plasmas, in Toulouse, France)
or the University of Iowa (Autoplot, this http URL) are available to display and analyze space physics
time series and spectrograms. Other tools include ExPRES (Exoplanetary and Planetary Radio Emission
Simulator) developed at LESIA. The VESPA (Virtual European Solar and Planetary Access) which provides
a search interface that allows the discovery of data of interest for scientific users, and is based
on IVOA standards (astronomical International Virtual Observatory Alliance). The University
of Iowa has developed the Das2 server that allows the distribution of data with adjustable temporal
resolution. MASER is making use of all these tools and standards to distribute datasets from space
and ground radio instruments available from the Observatoire de Paris, the Station de Radioastronomie
de Nancay and the CDPP deep archive. MASER also includes a Python software library for reading raw
data from agency archives.
