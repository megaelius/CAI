We present the analysis of the galaxy structural parameters from Halpha3, an Halpha narrow-band
imaging follow-up survey of ~800 galaxies selected from the HI ALFALFA Survey in the Local and Coma
Superclusters. Taking advantage of Halpha3 which provides the complete census of the recent star-forming,
HI-rich galaxies in the local universe, we aim to investigate the structural parameters of both
the young (<10 Myr) and the old (>1 Gyr) stellar populations. By comparing the sizes of these
stellar components we investigated the spatial scale on which galaxies are growing at the present
cosmological epoch and the role of the environment in quenching the star-formation activity. We
computed the concentration, asymmetry, and clumpiness structural parameters. To quantify the
sizes we computed half-light radii and a new parameter dubbed EW/r. The concentration index computed
in the r band depends on the stellar mass and on the Hubble type, these variables being related since
most massive galaxies are bulge dominated thus most concentrated. Going toward later spirals and
irregulars both the concentration index and the stellar mass decrease. Blue Compact dwarfs represent
an exception since they have similar stellar mass but they are more concentrated than dwarf irregulars.
The asymmetry and the clumpiness increase along the spiral sequence then they decrease going into
the dwarf regime, where the light distribution is smooth and more symmetric. When measured on Halpha
images, the CAS parameters do not exhibit obvious correlations with Hubble type. We found that the
concentration index is the main parameter that describes the current growth of isolated galaxies
but, for a fixed concentration, the stellar mass plays a second order role. At the present epoch,
massive galaxies are growing inside-out, conversely the dwarfs are growing on the scale of their
already assembled mass.
