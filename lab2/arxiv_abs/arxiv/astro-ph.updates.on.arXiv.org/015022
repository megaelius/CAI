We use a high-resolution cosmological dark matter-only simulation to study the orbital trajectories
of haloes and subhaloes in the environs of isolated hosts. We carefully tally all apsis points and
use them to distinguish haloes that are infalling for the first time from those that occupy more evolved
orbits. We find that roughly 21 per cent of subhaloes within a host's virial radius are currently
on first infall, and have not yet reached their first orbital pericentre; roughly 44 per cent are
still approaching their first apocentre after infall. For the range of host masses studied, roughly
half of all accreted systems were pre-processed prior to infall, and about 20 per cent were accreted
in groups. We confirm that the entire population of accreted subhaloes -- often referred to as "associated"
subhaloes -- extend far beyond the virial radii of their hosts, with roughly half currently residing
at distances that exceed $\approx 1.2\times r_{200}$. Many of these backsplash haloes have gained
orbital energy since infall, and occupy extreme orbits that carry them well past their initial turnaround
radii. Such extreme orbits are created during the initial accretion and dissolution of loosely
bound groups, but also through penetrating encounters between subhaloes on subsequent orbits.
The same processes may also give rise to unexpectedly abrupt losses of orbital energy. These effects
combine, giving rise to a large variation in the ratio of sequent apocentres for accreted systems.
We find that, within 2 virial radii from host centres, the concentrations of first-infall halos
are remarkably similar those of isolated field halos, whereas backsplash haloes, as well as systems
that were pre-processed, are considerably more concentrated.
