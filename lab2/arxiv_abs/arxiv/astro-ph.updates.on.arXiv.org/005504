We present an ALMA high-resolution observation of the 840 um continuum and [CII] line emission in
the WISE-SDSS selected hyper-luminous (WISSH) QSO J1015+0020 at z~4.4.We reveal an exceptional
overdensity of [CII]-emitting companions with a very small (<150 km/s) velocity shift with respect
to the QSO redshift. We report the discovery of the closest companion observed so far in sub-mm observations
of high-z QSOs, distant only 2.2 kpc and merging with J1015+0020, while two other [CII] emitters
are found at 8 and 17 kpc. Two strong continuum emitters are also detected at <3.5 arcsec. They are
likely associated to the same overdense structure of J1015+0020, as they exceed by a factor of 100
the number of expected sources, considering the Log(N)-Log(S) at 850 um. The host galaxy of J1015+0020
shows a SFR of about 100 Msun/yr while the total SFR of the QSO and its companion galaxies is a factor
of 10 higher, indicating that substantial stellar mass assembly at early epochs may have taken place
in the QSO satellites. For J1015+0020 we compute a SMBH mass MBH~6E9 Msun and a dynamical mass Mdyn~4E10
Msun . This translates into an extreme ratio Mdyn/MBH~7. The total stellar mass of the QSO host galaxy
plus the [CII] emitters already exceeds 1E11 Msun at z~4.4. They will likely merge and develop into
a giant galaxy of 1.3E12 Msun. By comparing the black hole accretion rate and the SFR, and assuming
that local relations between the mass outflow rate and the QSO bolometric luminosity hold at the
observed redshift, we conclude that J1015+0020 is potentially able to drive a massive molecular
outflow affecting the SFR in the QSO host galaxy, similarly to what observed for 47 QSOs at z>4.5.
Under the assumption of constant mass or Eddington accretion rate equal to the observed ones, we
find that the growth timescale of the host galaxy is comparable or even shorter than the one inferred
for the SMBH.
