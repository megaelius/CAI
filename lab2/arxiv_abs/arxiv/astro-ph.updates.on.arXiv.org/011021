In this paper we report on $\sim10$ years of observations of PSR J2051$-$0827, at radio frequencies
in the range 110--4032 MHz. We investigate the eclipse phenomena of this black widow pulsar using
model fits of increased dispersion and scattering of the pulsed radio emission as it traverses the
eclipse medium. These model fits reveal variability in dispersion features on timescales as short
as the orbital period, and previously unknown trends on timescales of months--years. No clear patterns
are found between the low-frequency eclipse widths, orbital period variations and trends in the
intra-binary material density. Using polarisation calibrated observations we present the first
available limits on the strength of magnetic fields within the eclipse region of this system; the
average line of sight field is constrained to be $10^{-4}$ G $\lesssim B_{||} \lesssim 10^2$ G, while
for the case of a field directed near-perpendicular to the line of sight we find $B_{\perp} \lesssim
0.3$ G. Depolarisation of the linearly polarised pulses during the eclipse is detected and attributed
to rapid rotation measure fluctuations of $\sigma_{\text{RM}} \gtrsim 100$ rad m$^{-2}$ along,
or across, the line of sights averaged over during a sub-integration. The results are considered
in the context of eclipse mechanisms, and we find scattering and/or cyclotron absorption provide
the most promising explanation, while dispersion smearing is conclusively ruled out. Finally,
we estimate the mass loss rate from the companion to be $\dot{M}_{\text{C}} \sim 10^{-12} M_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$, suggesting that the companion will not be fully evaporated on any reasonable timescale.
