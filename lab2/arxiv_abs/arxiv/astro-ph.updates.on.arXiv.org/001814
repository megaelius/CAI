It is likely that nearly all central galactic massive and supermassive black holes are nonradiative:
their accretion luminosities are orders of magnitude below what can be explained by efficient black
hole accretion within their ambient environments. These objects, of which Sagittarius A* is the
best-known example, are also dilute (mildly collisional to highly collisionless) and optically
thin. In order for accretion to occur, magnetohydrodynamic instabilities must develop that not
only transport angular momentum, but also gravitational energy generated through matter infall,
outwards. A class of new magnetohydrodynamical fluid instabilities -- the magnetoviscous-thermal
instability (MVTI) (Islam12) -- was found to transport angular momentum and energy along magnetic
field lines through large (fluid) viscosities and thermal conductivities. This paper describes
the collisionless and mildly collisional analogue to the MVTI, the collisional magnetothermal
instability (CMTI), that similarly transports energy and angular momentum outwards, expected
to be important in describing the flow properties of hot, dilute, and radiatively inefficient accretion
flows around black holes. In this paper we derive a form of the collisionless drift-kinetic equation
appropriate for accretion physics. We construct a local equilibrium for MHD stability analysis
in this differentially rotating disk. We then find and characterize specific instabilities expected
to be important in describing the flow properties of hot, dilute, and radiatively inefficient accretion
flows around black holes, and show their qualitative similarities to instabilities derived using
a fluid formalism (Islam12). We conclude with further work needed in modeling this class of accretion
flow.
