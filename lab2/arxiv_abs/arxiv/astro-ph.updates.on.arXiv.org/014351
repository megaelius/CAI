In 2016, the first strongly lensed Type Ia supernova, iPTF16geu at redshift $z=0.409$ with four
resolved images arranged symmetrically around the lens galaxy at $z=0.2163$, was discovered.
Here, refined observations of iPTF16geu, including the time delay between images, are used to decrease
uncertainties in the lens model, including the the slope of the projected surface density of the
lens galaxy, $\Sigma\propto r^{1-\eta}$, and to constrain the universal expansion rate $H_0$.
Imaging with HST provides an upper limit on the slope $\eta$, in slight tension with the steeper density
profiles indicated by imaging with Keck after iPTF16geu had faded, potentially due to dust extinction
not corrected for in host galaxy imaging. Since smaller $\eta$ implies larger magnifications,
we take advantage of the standard candle nature of Type Ia supernovae constraining the image magnifications,
to obtain an independent constraint of the slope. We find that a smooth lens density fails to explain
the iPTF16geu fluxes, regardless of the slope, and additional sub-structure lensing is needed.
The total probability for the smooth halo model combined with star microlensing to explain the iPTF16geu
image fluxes is maximized at $12\,\%$ for $\eta\sim 1.8$, in excellent agreement with Keck high
spatial resolution data, and flatter than an isothermal halo. It also agrees perfectly with independent
constraints on the slope from lens velocity dispersion measurements. Combining with the observed
time delays between the images, we infer a lower bound on the Hubble constant, $H_0 \gtrsim 40\,{\rm
km \ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ at $68.3\,\%$ confidence level.
