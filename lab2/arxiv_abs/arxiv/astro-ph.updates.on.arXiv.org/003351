Follow-up observations at high-angular resolution of submillimeter galaxies showed that the
single-dish sources are comprised of a blend of several galaxies. Consequently, number counts
derived from low and high angular resolution observations are in disagreement. This demonstrates
the importance of resolution effects and the need to have realistic simulations to explore them.
We built a new 2deg^2 simulation of the extragalactic sky from the far-infrared to the submillimeter.
It is based on an updated version of the two star-formation mode galaxy evolution model. Using global
galaxy properties, we use the abundance matching technique to populate a dark-matter lightcone
and thus simulate the clustering. We produce maps and extract the sources, and show that the limited
angular resolution of single-dish instruments have a strong impact on (sub)millimeter continuum
observations. Taking into account these resolution effects, we are reproducing a large set of observables,
including number counts, redshift distributions, and cosmic infrared background power spectra.
Our simulation describes consistently the number counts from single-dish telescopes and interferometers.
In particular, at 350 and 500 um, we find that number counts measured by Herschel between 5 and 50 mJy
are biased towards high values by a factor 2, and that redshift distributions are biased towards
low z. We also show that the clustering has an important impact on the Herschel pixel histogram used
to derive number counts from P(D) analysis. Finally, we demonstrate that the large number density
of red Herschel sources found in observations but not in models could be an observational artifact
caused by the combination of noise, resolution effects, and the steepness of color and flux density
distributions. Our simulation (SIDES) is available at this http URL
