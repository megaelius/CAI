The discovery of planets in close orbits around binary stars raises questions about their formation.
It is believed that these planets formed in the outer regions of the disc and then migrated through
planet-disc interaction to their current location. Considering five different systems (Kepler-16,
-34, -35, -38 and -413) we model planet migration through the disc, with special focus on the final
orbital elements of the planets. We investigate how the final orbital parameters are influenced
by the disc and planet masses. Using 2D, locally isothermal, viscous hydrodynamical simulations
we first model the disc dynamics for all five systems, followed by a study of the migration properties
of embedded planets with different masses. For all systems we find that the discs become eccentric
and precess slowly. We confirm the bifurcation feature in the precession period -- gap-size diagram
for different binary mass ratios. The Kepler-16, -35, -38 and -413 systems lie on the lower branch
and Kepler-34 on the upper one. For systems with small binary eccentricity we find a new non-monotonic,
loop-like feature. In all systems the planets migrate to the inner edge of the disc cavity. Depending
on the planet-disc mass ratio we observe two different regimes. Massive planets can significantly
alter the disc structure by compressing and circularising the inner cavity and they remain on nearly
circular orbits. Lower mass planets are strongly influenced by the disc, their eccentricity is
exited to high values, and their orbits are aligned with the inner disc in a state of apsidal corotation.
In our simulations the final locations of the planets are typically too large with respect to the
observations because of the large inner gaps of the discs. The migrating planets in the most eccentric
discs (around Kepler-34 and -413) show the largest final eccentricity in agreement with the observations.
