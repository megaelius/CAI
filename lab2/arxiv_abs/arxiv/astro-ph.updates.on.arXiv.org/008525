We examine the accuracy of spatial derivatives computed from numerical simulations of supersonic
turbulence. Two sets of simulations, carried out using a finite-volume code that evolves the hydrodynamic
equations with an approximate Riemann solver and a finite-difference code that solves the Navier-Stokes
equations, are tested against a number of criteria based on the continuity equation, including
exact results at statistically steady state. We find that the spatial derivatives in the Navier-Stokes
runs are accurate and satisfy all the criteria. In particular, they satisfy our exact results that
the conditional mean velocity divergence, $\langle \nabla \cdot {\bs u}|s\rangle$, where $s$
is the logarithm of density, and the conditional mean of the advection of $s$, $\langle {\bs u} \cdot
\nabla s|s\rangle$, vanish at steady state for all density values, $s$. On the other hand, the Riemann
solver simulations fail all the tests that require accurate evaluation of spatial derivatives,
resulting in apparent violation of the continuity equation, even if the solver enforces mass conservation.
In particular, analysis of the Riemann simulations may lead to the incorrect conclusion that the
$\pdv$ work tends to preferentially convert kinetic energy into thermal energy, inconsistent
with the exact result that the energy exchange by $\pdv$ work is symmetric in barotropic supersonic
turbulence at steady state. The inaccuracy of spatial derivatives is a general problem in the post-processing
of simulations of supersonic turbulence with Riemann solvers. Solutions from such simulations
must be used with caution in post-processing studies concerning the spatial gradients.
