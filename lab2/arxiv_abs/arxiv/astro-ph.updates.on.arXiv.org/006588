We introduce a new modelling framework called FLiTs to simulate infrared line emission spectra
from protoplanetary discs. This paper focuses on the mid-IR spectral region between 9.7 um to 40
um for T Tauri stars. The generated spectra contain several tens of thousands of molecular emission
lines of H2O, OH, CO, CO2, HCN, C2H2, H2 and a few other molecules, as well as the forbidden atomic emission
lines of SI, SII, SIII, SiII, FeII, NeII, NeIII, ArII and ArIII. In contrast to previously published
works, we do not treat the abundances of the molecules nor the temperature in the disc as free parameters,
but use the complex results of detailed 2D ProDiMo disc models concerning gas and dust temperature
structure, and molecular concentrations. FLiTs computes the line emission spectra by ray tracing
in an efficient, fast and reliable way. The results are broadly consistent with R=600 Spitzer/IRS
observational data of T Tauri stars concerning line strengths, colour, and line ratios. In order
to achieve that agreement, however, we need to assume either a high gas/dust mass ratio of order 1000,
or the presence of illuminated disc walls at distances of a few au. The molecules in these walls cannot
be photo-dissociated easily by UV because of the large densities in the walls which favour their
re-formation. Most observable molecular emission lines are found to be optically thick, rendering
a standard analysis with column densities difficult. We find that the difference between gas and
dust temperatures in the disc surface is important for the line formation. We briefly discuss the
effects of C/O ratio and choice of chemical rate network on these results. Our analysis offers new
ways to infer the chemical and temperature structure of T Tauri discs from future JWST/MIRI observations,
and to possibly detect secondary illuminated disc walls based on their specific mid-IR molecular
signature.
