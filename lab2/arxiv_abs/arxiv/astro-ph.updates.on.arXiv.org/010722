Planetary-scale waves at the Venusian cloud-top cause periodic variations in both winds and ultraviolet
(UV) brightness. While the wave candidates are the 4-day Kelvin wave and 5-day Rossby wave with zonal
wavenumber 1, their temporal evolutions are poorly understood. Here we conducted a time series
analysis of the 365-nm brightness and cloud-tracking wind variations, obtained by the UV Imager
onboard the Japanese Venus Climate Orbiter Akatsuki from June to October 2017, revealing a dramatic
evolution of planetary-scale waves and corresponding changes in planetary-scale UV features.
We identified a prominent 5-day periodicity in both the winds and brightness variations, whose
phase velocities were slower than the dayside mean zonal winds (or the super-rotation) by >35 m s$^{-1}$.
The reconstructed planetary-scale vortices were nearly equatorially symmetric and centered
at ~35{\deg} latitude in both hemispheres, which indicated that they were part of a Rossby wave.
The amplitude of winds variation associated with the observed Rossby wave packet were amplified
gradually over ~20 days and attenuated over ~50 days. Following the formation of the Rossby wave
vortices, brightness variation emerges to form rippling white cloud belts in the 45{\deg}-60{\deg}
latitudes of both hemispheres. ~3.8-day periodic signals were observed in the zonal wind and brightness
variations in the equatorial region before the Rossby wave amplification. Although the amplitude
and significance of the 3.8-day mode were relatively low in the observation season, this feature
is consistent with a Kelvin wave, which may be the cause of the dark clusters in the equatorial region.
