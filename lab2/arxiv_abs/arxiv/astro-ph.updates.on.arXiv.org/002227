The 3D-HST and CANDELS programs have provided WFC3 and ACS spectroscopy and imaging over ~900 sq.
arcmin in five fields: AEGIS, COSMOS, GOODS-North, GOODS-South, and the UKIDSS UDS field. All these
fields have a wealth of publicly available imaging datasets in addition to the HST data, which makes
it possible to construct the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of objects over a wide wavelength
range. In this paper we describe a photometric analysis of the CANDELS and 3D-HST HST imaging and
the ancillary imaging data at wavelengths 0.3um -8um. Objects were selected in the WFC3 near-IR
bands, and their SEDs were determined by carefully taking the effects of the point spread function
in each observation into account. A total of 147 distinct imaging datasets were used in the analysis.
The photometry is made available in the form of six catalogs: one for each field, as well as a master
catalog containing all objects in the entire survey. We also provide derived data products: photometric
redshifts, determined with the EAZY code, and stellar population parameters determined with the
FAST code. We make all the imaging data that were used in the analysis available, including our reductions
of the WFC3 imaging in all five fields. 3D-HST is a spectroscopic survey with the WFC3 and ACS grisms,
and the photometric catalogs presented here constitute a necessary first step in the analysis of
these grism data. In a companion paper (I. Momcheva et al., in preparation) we present line diagnostics
and improved redshifts from an analysis of the combination of the photometry with the grism spectra.
All the data presented in this paper are available through the 3D-HST website.
