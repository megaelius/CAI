The SHINE program is a large high-contrast near-infrared survey of 600 young, nearby stars. It is
aimed at searching for and characterizing new planetary systems using VLT/SPHERE's unprecedented
high-contrast and high-angular resolution imaging capabilities. It also intends at placing statistical
constraints on the occurrence and orbital properties of the giant planet population at large orbits
as a function of the stellar host mass and age to test planet formation theories. We use the IRDIS dual-band
imager and the IFS integral field spectrograph of SPHERE to acquire high-constrast coronagraphic
differential near-infrared images and spectra of the young A2 star HIP65426. It is a member of the
~17 Myr old Lower Centaurus-Crux association. At a separation of 830 mas (92 au projected) from the
star, we detect a faint red companion. Multi-epoch observations confirm that it shares common proper
motion with HIP65426. Spectro-photometric measurements extracted with IFS and IRDIS between
0.95 and 2.2um indicate a warm, dusty atmosphere characteristic of young low surface-gravity L5-L7
dwarfs. Hot-start evolutionary models predict a luminosity consistent with a 6-12 MJup, Teff=1300-1600
K and R=1.5 RJup giant planet. Finally, the comparison with Exo-REM and PHOENIX BT-Settl synthetic
atmosphere models gives consistent effective temperatures but with slightly higher surface gravity
solutions of log(g)=4.0-5.0 with smaller radii (1.0-1.3 RJup). Given its physical and spectral
properties, HIP65426b occupies a rather unique placement in terms of age, mass and spectral-type
among the currently known imaged planets. It represents a particularly interesting case to study
the presence of clouds as a function of particle size, composition, and location in the atmosphere,
to search for signatures of non-equilibrium chemistry, and finally to test the theory of planet
formation and evolution.
