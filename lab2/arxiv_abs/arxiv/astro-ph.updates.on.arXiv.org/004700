The cloud formation process starts with the formation of seed particles, after which, surface chemical
reactions grow or erode the cloud particles. We investigate which materials may form cloud condensation
seeds in the gas temperature and pressure regimes (T$_{\rm gas}$ = 100-2000 K, p$_{\rm gas}$ = 10$^{-8}$-100
bar) expected to occur in planetary and brown dwarf atmospheres. We apply modified classical nucleation
theory which requires surface tensions and vapour pressure data for each solid species, which are
taken from the literature. We calculate the seed formation rates of TiO$_{2}$[s] and SiO[s] and
find that they efficiently nucleate at high temperatures of T$_{\rm gas}$ = 1000-1750 K. Cr[s],
KCl[s] and NaCl[s] are found to efficiently nucleate across an intermediate temperature range
of T$_{\rm gas}$ = 500-1000 K. We find CsCl[s] may serve as the seed particle for the water cloud layers
in cool sub-stellar atmospheres. Four low temperature ice species, H$_{2}$O[s/l], NH$_{3}$[s],
H$_{2}$S[s/l] and CH$_{4}$[s], nucleation rates (T$_{\rm gas}$ = 100-250 K) are also investigated
for the coolest sub-stellar/planetary atmospheres. Our results suggest a possibly, (T$_{\rm
gas}$, p$_{\rm gas}$) distributed hierarchy of seed particle formation regimes throughout the
sub-stellar and planetary atmospheric temperature-pressure space. In order to improve the accuracy
of the nucleation rate calculation, further research into the small cluster thermochemical data
for each cloud species is warranted. The validity of these seed particle scenarios will be tested
by applying it to more complete cloud models in the future.
