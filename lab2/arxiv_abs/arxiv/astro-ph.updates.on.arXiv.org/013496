Recently, gas disks have been discovered around main sequence stars well beyond the usual protoplanetary
disk lifetimes (i.e., > 10 Myrs), when planets have already formed. These gas disks, mainly composed
of CO, carbon, and oxygen seem to be ubiquitous in systems with planetesimal belts (similar to our
Kuiper belt), and can last for hundreds of millions of years. Planets orbiting in these gas disks
will accrete a large quantity of gas that will transform their primordial atmospheres into new secondary
atmospheres with compositions similar to that of the parent gas disk. Here, we quantify how large
a secondary atmosphere can be created for a variety of observed gas disks and for a wide range of planet
types. We find that gas accretion in this late phase is very significant and an Earth's atmospheric
mass of gas is readily accreted on terrestrial planets in very tenuous gas disks. In slightly more
massive disks, we show that massive CO atmospheres can be accreted, forming planets with up to sub-Neptune-like
pressures. Our new results demonstrate that new secondary atmospheres with high metallicities
and high C/O ratios will be created in these late gas disks, resetting their primordial compositions
inherited from the protoplanetary disk phase, and providing a new birth to planets that lost their
atmosphere to photoevaporation or giant impacts. We therefore propose a new paradigm for the formation
of atmospheres on low-mass planets, which can be tested with future observations (JWST, ELT, ARIEL).
We also show that this late accretion would show a very clear signature in Sub-Neptunes or cold exo-Jupiters.
Finally, we find that accretion creates cavities in late gas disks, which could be used as a new planet
detection method, for low mass planets a few au to a few tens of au from their host stars.
