As our closest cluster-neighbor, the Virgo cluster of galaxies is intensely studied by observers
to unravel the mysteries of galaxy evolution within clusters. At this stage, cosmological numerical
simulations of the cluster are useful to efficiently test theories and calibrate model. However,
it is not trivial to select the perfect simulacrum of the Virgo cluster to fairly compare in detail
its observed and simulated galaxy populations that are affected by the type and history of the cluster.
Determining precisely the properties of Virgo for a later selection of simulated clusters becomes
essential. It is still not clear how to access some of these properties such as the past history of
the Virgo cluster from current observations. Therefore, directly producing effective simulacra
of the Virgo cluster is inevitable. Efficient simulacra of the Virgo cluster can be obtained via
simulations that resemble the local Universe down to the cluster scale. In such simulations, Virgo-like
halos form in the proper local environment and permit assessing the most probable formation history
of the cluster. Studies based on these simulations have already revealed that the Virgo cluster
has had a quiet merging history over the last seven gigayears and that the cluster accretes matter
along a preferential direction. This paper reveals that in addition such Virgo halos have had on
average only one merger larger than about a tenth of their mass at redshift zero within the last four
gigayears. This second branch (by opposition to main branch) formed in a given sub-region and merged
recently (within the last gigayear). These properties are not shared with a set of random halos within
the same mass range. This study extends [truncated]
