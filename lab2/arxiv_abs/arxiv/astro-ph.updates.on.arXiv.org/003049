Eos family was created during a catastrophic impact about 1.3 Gyr ago. Rotation states of individual
family members contain information about the history of the whole population. We aim to increase
the number of asteroid shape models and rotation states within the Eos collision family, as well
as to revise previously published shape models from the literature. Such results can be used to constrain
theoretical collisional and evolution models of the family, or to estimate other physical parameters
by a thermophysical modeling of the thermal infrared data. We use all available disk-integrated
optical data (i.e., classical dense-in-time photometry obtained from public databases and through
a large collaboration network as well as sparse-in-time individual measurements from a few sky
surveys) as input for the convex inversion method, and derive 3D shape models of asteroids together
with their rotation periods and orientations of rotation axes. We present updated shape models
for 15 asteroids and new shape model determinations for 16 asteroids. Together with the already
published models from the publicly available DAMIT database, we compiled a sample of 56 Eos family
members with known shape models that we used in our analysis of physical properties within the family.
Rotation states of asteroids smaller than ~20 km are heavily influenced by the YORP effect, whilst
the large objects more or less retained their rotation state properties since the family creation.
Moreover, we also present a shape model and bulk density of asteroid (423) Diotima, an interloper
in the Eos family, based on the disk-resolved data obtained by the Near InfraRed Camera (Nirc2) mounted
on the W.M. Keck II telescope.
