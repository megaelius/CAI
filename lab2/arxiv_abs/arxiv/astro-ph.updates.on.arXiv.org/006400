Young radio AGN are pivotal for our understanding of many of the still-debated aspects of AGN feedback.
In this paper we present a study of the interstellar medium in the compact, peaked-spectrum radio
galaxy PKSB1934-63 using X-shooter observations. Most of the warm ionized gas resides within a
circum-nuclear disk with a radius of about 200pc that is likely to constitute the gas reservoir from
which the central black hole feeds. On the other hand, we find a biconical outflow of warm ionized
gas with an estimated radius of 59+/-12pc. This matches the radial extent of the radio source and
suggests that the outflow is jet driven. Thanks to the superior wavelength coverage of the data,
we can estimate the density of the warm ionized gas using the trans-auroral line technique, and we
find that the outflowing gas has remarkably high density, up to n_e~10^5.5cm^-3 . The estimated
mass outflow rate is low (M_dot=10^-3 - 10^-1 M_solar/yr) and the AGN feedback operates at relatively
low efficiency (E_dot/L_bol~10^-4 - 10^-3 %), in contrast to predictions of theoretical models.
In addition, optical and near-IR line ratios show that the expansion of the radio source drives fast
shocks (with velocities v>500km/s) that ionize and accelerate the outflowing gas. At odds with
the properties of other compact, peaked-spectrum radio sources hosting warm ionized gas outflows,
we do not find signs of kinematically disturbed or outflowing gas in phases colder than the warm ionized
gas. We argue that this is due to the young age of our source and thus to the recent nature of the AGN-ISM
interaction, and suggest that cold gas forms within the outflowing material and the shock-ionized
outflowing gas of PKSB1934-63 did not have enough time to cool down, and accumulate in a colder phase.
This scenario is also supported by the multi-phase outflows of other compact and young radio sources
in the literature.
