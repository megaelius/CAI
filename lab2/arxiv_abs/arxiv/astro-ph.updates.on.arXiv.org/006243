Diffuse synchrotron radio emission has been observed in a number of cool-core clusters on scales
comparable to that of the cooling region. These radio sources are called `mini-halos'. In order
to understand their origin, which is still unclear, joint radio/X-ray statistical studies of large
cluster samples are necessary to investigate the radio mini-halo properties and their connection
with the cluster thermodynamics. In this work we extend our previous explorative study (Gitti et
al. 2015) and investigate the perspectives offered by surveys in the radio continuum with LOFAR
and SKA, in particular examining for the first time the effect of the intra-cluster magnetic field
in the mini-halo region. By considering the minimum flux detectable in radio surveys and exploiting
the $P_{radio}-L_X$ correlation observed for known mini-halos, we estimate the detection limits
achievable by future radio observational follow-up of X-ray cluster samples, such as HIFLUGCS
and eROSITA. This allows us to estimate the maximum number of radio mini-halos that can potentially
be discovered in future surveys as a function of redshift and magnetic field strength. We show that
future radio surveys with LOFAR and SKA1 (at 140 MHz and 1.4 GHz) have the potential to discover ~1,000-10,000
radio mini-halo candidates up to redshift z=1. We further note that future SKA1 radio surveys at
redshift z>0.6 will allow us to discriminate between different magnetic fields in the mini-halo
region, because higher magnetic fields are expected to produce more powerful mini-halos, thus
implying a larger number of mini-halo detected at high redshift. For example, the non-detection
with SKA1 of mini-halos at z>0.6 will suggest a low magnetic field (B < few $\mu$G). The synergy of
these radio surveys with future X-ray observations and theoretical studies is essential in establishing
the radio mini-halo physical nature. [abridged]
