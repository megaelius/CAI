Large numbers of low-to-medium resolution spectra of M-type dwarf stars from both the local Galactic
disk and halo are available from various surveys. In order to fully exploit these data, we develop
a template-fit method using a set of empirically assembled M dwarf/subdwarf classification templates,
based on the measurements of the TiO and CaH molecular bands, to classify M dwarfs/subdwarfs by spectral
type and metallicity class. We further present a pipeline to automatically determine the effective
temperature, metallicity ([M/H]), alpha-element to iron abundance ratio ([alpha/Fe]), and surface
gravity of M dwarfs/subdwarfs using the latest version of BT-Settl model atmospheres. We apply
these methods to a set of low-to-medium resolution optical spectra of 1,544 high proper-motion
(> 0.4"/yr) M dwarfs/subdwarfs. Our metallicity estimates appear to be consistent with the expected
color-magnitude variation of stars relative to atmospheric composition, as our sample shows a
clear stratification with respect to metallicity in the Gaia H-R diagram. Furthermore, the measured
chemical parameters of the two components in 48 binary systems are in a good agreement with each other,
which suggest a precision of 0.22 dex in [M/H], 0.08 dex in [alpha/Fe], and 0.16 dex in the combined
index [alpha/Fe]+[M/H]. There is also a good consistency between metallicity class, obtained
from the empirical classification templates, and the index [alpha/Fe]+[M/H] (~ [alpha/H]), obtained
from model-fitting, which means that the more easily measured metallicity class can be used as a
relatively reliable indicator of absolute alpha-element abundance, [alpha/H], in low-mass stars.
Finally, we examine the distribution of our stars in the [alpha/Fe] vs. [M/H] diagram, which shows
evidence of clustering in chemical abundance makeup, suggestive of discrete populations among
the local disk and halo stars.
