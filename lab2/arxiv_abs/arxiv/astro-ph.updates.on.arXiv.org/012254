We report the results of the first $\sim4\,\rm{years}$ of spectroscopic and photometric monitoring
of the Type IIn supernova SN 2015da (aka PSN J13522411+3941286, or iPTF16tu). The supernova exploded
in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 5337, in a relatively highly extinguished environment. SN 2015da
shows prominent Balmer lines in emission with narrow components at all times and a slow rise to maximum.
In addition, early observations performed by amateur astronomers give a very well-constrained
explosion epoch. The observables are consistent with continuous interaction between the supernova
ejecta and a dense and extended H-rich circumstellar medium. The presence of such an extended and
dense medium is difficult to reconcile with standard stellar evolution models, since the metallicity
at the position of SN 2015da seems to be slightly sub-solar. Interaction is likely the mechanism
powering the light curve, as confirmed by the analysis of the pseudo bolometric light curve, which
gives a total radiated energy $\gtrsim10^{51}\,\rm{erg}$. Modeling the light curve in the context
of a supernova shock breakout through a dense circumstellar medium allowed us to infer the mass of
the pre-existing gas to be $\simeq8\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$, with an extreme mass-loss rate for the progenitor
star $\simeq0.6\,\rm{M_{\odot}}\,\rm{yr^{-1}}$, suggesting that most of the circumstellar
gas was produced during multiple eruptive events. Near- and mid-infrared observations reveal
a flux excess in these domains, similar to those observed in SN 2010jl and other interacting transients,
likely due to pre-existing radiatively-heated dust surrounding the supernova. By modeling the
infrared excess, we infer a mass $\gtrsim0.4\times10^{-3}\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ for the dust.
