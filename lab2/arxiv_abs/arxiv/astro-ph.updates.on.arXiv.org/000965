The Kepler mission discovery of candidate transiting exoplanets (KOIs) enables a plethora of ensemble
analysis of the architecture and properties of exoplanetary systems. We compare the observed transit
durations of KOIs to a synthetic distribution generated from the known eccentricities of radial
velocity (RV) discovered exoplanets. We find that the Kepler and RV distributions differ at a statistically
significant level. We identify three related systematic trends that are likely due to errors in
stellar radii, which in turn affect the inferred exoplanet radii and the distribution thereof,
and prevent a valid analysis of the underlying ensemble eccentricity distribution. First, 15%
of KOIs have transit durations >20% longer than the transit duration expected for an edge-on
circular orbit, including 92 KOIs with transit durations >50% longer, when only a handful of
such systems are expected. Second, the median transit duration is too long by up to ~25%. Random errors
of <50% in the stellar radius are not adequate to account for these two trends, and they are present
for all spectral types in the Kepler sample. We identify that incorrect estimates of stellar metallicity
and extinction could account for these anomalies, rather than astrophysical effects such as eccentric
exoplanets improbably transiting near apastron. Third, we find that the median transit duration
is correlated with stellar radius, when no such trend is expected. All three effects are still present,
although less pronounced, when considering only multiple transiting KOI systems which are thought
to have a low false positive rate. Improved stellar parameters for KOIs are necessary for the validity
of future ensemble tests of exoplanetary systems found by Kepler.
