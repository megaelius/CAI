(Abridged) Blue compact galaxies (BCG) are gas-rich, low-mass, small systems that form stars at
unusually high rates. This makes them excellent laboratories for investigating the process of
star-formation (SF) at galactic scales and the effects of massive stellar feedback on the interstellar
(and intergalactic) medium. We analyzed the BCG Tololo 1937-423 using optical integral field spectroscopy
with VIMOS at the Very Large Telescope to probe its morphology, stellar content, nebular excitation
and ionization properties, and the kinematics of its warm ionized gas. We found that Tololo 1937-423
is currently undergoing an extended starburst, with nine major $H\alpha$ clumps. The galaxy presents
a single continuum peak that is not cospatial with any knot in emission lines, indicating at least
two relatively recent episodes of SF. The inhomogeneous dust distribution reaches its maximum
roughly at the position of the continuum peak. We found shocked regions in the galaxy outer regions
and at the edges of the SF knots. The oxygen abundance is similar in all the SF regions, suggesting
a chemically homogeneous ionized interstellar medium over spatial scales of several kpc. The ionized
gas kinematics displays an overall regular rotation around a northwest-southeast axis. The morphology
of the galaxy and the two different episodes of SF suggest a scenario of triggered (induced by supernova
shock waves) SF acting in Tololo 1937-423. The inferred ages for the different SF episodes (~13-80
Myr for the central post-starburst and 5-7 Myr for the ongoing SF) are consistent with triggered
SF, with the most recent SF episode caused by the collective effect of stellar winds and supernova
explosions from the central post-starburst. The velocity dispersion pattern, with higher velocity
dispersions found at the edges of the SF regions, and shocked regions in the galaxy, also favor this
scenario.
