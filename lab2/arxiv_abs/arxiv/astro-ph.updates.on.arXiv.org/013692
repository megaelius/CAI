We explore the chemodynamical properties of a sample of barred galaxies in the Auriga magneto-hydrodynamical
cosmological zoom-in simulations, which form boxy/peanut (b/p) bulges, and compare these to the
Milky Way (MW). We show that the Auriga galaxies which best reproduce the chemodynamical properties
of stellar populations in the MW bulge have quiescent merger histories since redshift $z\sim3.5$:
their last major merger occurs at $t_{\rm lookback}>12\,\rm Gyrs$, while subsequent mergers have
a stellar mass ratio of $\leq$1:20, suggesting an upper limit of a few percent for the mass ratio of
the recently proposed Gaia Sausage/Enceladus merger. These Auriga MW-analogues have a negligible
fraction of ex-situ stars in the b/p region ($<1\%$), with flattened, thick disc-like metal-poor
stellar populations. The average fraction of ex-situ stars in the central regions of all Auriga
galaxies with b/p's is 3% -- significantly lower than in those which do not host a b/p or a bar. While
the central regions of these barred galaxies contain the oldest populations, they also have stars
younger than 5Gyrs (>30%) and exhibit X-shaped age and abundance distributions. Examining the
discs in our sample, we find that in some cases a star-forming ring forms around the bar, which alters
the metallicity of the inner regions of the galaxy. Further out in the disc, bar-induced resonances
lead to metal-rich ridges in the $V_{\phi}-r$ plane -- the longest of which is due to the Outer Lindblad
Resonance. Our results suggest the Milky Way has an uncommonly quiet merger history, which leads
to an essentially in-situ bulge, and highlight the significant effects the bar can have on the surrounding
disc.
