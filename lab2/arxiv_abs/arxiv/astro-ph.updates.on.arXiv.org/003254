To gain a better understanding of the inner disc region that comprises active galactic nuclei it
is necessary to understand the pattern in which the disc is illuminated (the emissivity profile)
by X-rays emitted from the continuum source above the black hole (corona). The differences in the
emissivity profiles produced by various corona geometries are explored via general relativistic
ray tracing simulations. Through the analysis of various parameters of the geometries simulated
it is found that emissivity profiles produced by point source and extended geometries such as cylindrical
slabs and spheroidal coronae placed on the accretion disc are distinguishable. Profiles produced
by point source and conical geometries are not significantly different, requiring an analysis
of reflection fraction to differentiate the two geometries. Beamed point and beamed conical sources
are also simulated in an effort to model jet-like coronae, though the differences here are most evident
in the reflection fraction. For a point source we determine an approximation for the measured reflection
fraction with the source height and velocity. Simulating spectra from the emissivity profiles
produced by the various geometries produce distinguishable differences. Overall spectral differences
between the geometries do not exceed 15 per cent in the most extreme cases. It is found that emissivity
profiles can be useful in distinguishing point source and extended geometries given high quality
spectral data of extreme, bright sources over long exposure times. In combination with reflection
fraction, timing, and spectral analysis we may use emissivity profiles to discern the geometry
of the X-ray source.
