Tidal heating is the prime suspect behind Enceladus's south polar heating anomaly and global subsurface
ocean. No model of internal tidal dissipation, however, can explain at the same time the total heat
budget and the focusing of the energy at the south pole. I study here whether the non-uniform icy shell
thickness can cause the north-south heating asymmetry by redistributing tidal heating either
in the shell or in the core. Starting from the non-uniform tidal thin shell equations, I compute the
volumetric rate, surface flux, and total power generated by tidal dissipation in shell and core.
If the shell is laterally uniform, the thin shell approach predicts shell dissipation with a few
percent error while the error on core dissipation is negligible. Variations in shell thickness
strongly increase the shell dissipation flux where the shell is thinner. For a hard shell with long-wavelength
variations, the shell dissipation flux can be predicted by scaling with the inverse local thickness
the flux for a laterally uniform shell. If Enceladus's shell is in conductive thermal equilibrium
with isostatic thickness variations, the nominal shell dissipation flux at the south pole is about
three times its value for a shell of uniform thickness, which remains negligible compared to the
observed flux. The shell dissipation rate should be ten times higher than nominal in order to account
for the spatial variations of the observed flux. Dissipation in an unconsolidated core can provide
the missing power, but does not generate any significant heating asymmetry as long as the core is
homogeneous. Non-steady state models, though not investigated here, face similar difficulties
in explaining the asymmetries of tidal heating and shell thickness.
