We searched the light curves of over 40000 stars in the 2MASS calibration database, spanning approximately
4 years, for objects that have significant day long dimming events. We also searched the multi-color
light curves for red dimming events that could be due to transient extinction. In the color independent
sigma-limited search, we found 46 previously unknown eclipsing binaries, 6 periodic variable
stars likely to be intrinsic pulsators and 21 young stellar objects in the $\rho$ Ophiucus star formation
region previously studied by Parks et al. 2013. An additional 11 objects exhibited dimming events
and most of these are unclassified. The search for red dimming events primarily reveals a population
of low luminosity active galaxies that become bluer when they are brighter, and variable young stellar
objects exhibiting high cross-correlation coefficients between color and brightness. The young
stellar objects exhibit brightness and color variations in the direction of interstellar extinction
whereas the active galaxies can have a bowed distribution in color and magnitude with reduced variation
in color when the object is brightest. Among the objects that are usually quiescent (not strongly
variable), we failed to find any dimming events deeper than 0.2 magnitude and lasting longer than
a day. Two of the least embedded young stellar objects, however, dimmed by 0.2 mag for longer than
a day without strong color variation. Having failed to find new exotic objects, we explored ways
to eliminate commonly found objects so that a larger number of objects may be searched. We find that
all but one eclipsing binary are excluded by requiring moderate color variation during a dimming
event and most of the active galaxies and young stellar objects are excluded by placing a limit on
the standard deviation of the magnitude distribution in the light curve.
