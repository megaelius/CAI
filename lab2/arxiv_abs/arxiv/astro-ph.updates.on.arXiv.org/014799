Although the search for extra-solar co-orbital bodies has not had success so far, it is believed
that they must be as common as they are in the Solar System. Co-orbital systems have been widely studied,
and there are several works on stability and even on formation. However, for the size and location
of the stable regions, authors usually describe their results but do not provide a way to find them
without numerical simulations, and, in most cases, the mass ratio value range is small. In the current
work, we study the structure of co-orbital stable regions for a wide range of mass ratio systems and
built empirical equations to describe them. It allows estimating the size and location of co-orbital
stable regions from a few system's parameters. Thousands of massless particles were distributed
in the co-orbital region of a massive secondary body and numerically simulated for a wide range of
mass ratios ($\mu$) adopting the planar circular restricted three-body problem. The results show
that the horseshoe regions upper limit is between $9.539 \times 10^{-4} < \mu < 1.192 \times 10^{-3}$,
which correspond to a minimum angular distance from the secondary to the separatrix between $27.239^{o}
$ and $27.802^{o} $. We also found that the limit to exist stability in the co-orbital region is about
$\mu = 2.3313 \times 10^{-2}$, much smaller than the value predicted by the linear theory. Polynomial
functions to describe the stable region parameters were found, and they represent estimates of
the angular and radial widths of the co-orbital stable regions for any system with $9.547 \times
10^{-5} \leq \mu \leq 2.331 \times 10^{-2}$.
