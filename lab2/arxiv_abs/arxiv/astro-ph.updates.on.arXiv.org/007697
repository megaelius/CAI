A challenging requirement posed by next-generation observations is a firm theoretical grasp of
the impact of baryons on structure formation. Cosmological hydrodynamic simulations modeling
gas physics are vital in this regard. A high degree of modeling flexibility exists in this space making
it important to explore a range of methods in order to gauge the accuracy of simulation predictions.
We present results from the first cosmological simulation using Conservative Reproducing Kernel
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (CRK-SPH). We employ two simulations: one evolved purely under
gravity and the other with non-radiative hydrodynamics. Each contains 2x2304^3 cold dark matter
plus baryon particles in an 800 Mpc/h box. We compare statistics to previous non-radiative simulations
including power spectra, mass functions, baryon fractions, and concentration. We find self-similar
radial profiles of gas temperature, entropy, and pressure and show that a simple analytic model
recovers these results to better than 40% over two orders of magnitude in mass. We quantify the level
of non-thermal pressure support in halos and demonstrate that hydrostatic mass estimates are biased
low by 24% (10%) for halos of mass 10^15 (10^13) Msun/h. We compute angular power spectra for the thermal
and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects and find good agreement with the low-l Planck measurements.
Finally, artificial scattering between particles of unequal mass is shown to have a large impact
on the gravity-only run and we highlight the importance of better understanding this issue in hydrodynamic
applications. This is the first in a simulation campaign using CRK-SPH with future work including
subresolution gas treatments.
