Previous XMM-Newton observations of the thermally emitting isolated neutron star RX J1605.3+3249
provided a candidate for a shallow periodic signal and evidence of a fast spin down, which suggested
a high dipolar magnetic field and an evolution from a magnetar. We obtained a large programme with
XMM-Newton to confirm its candidate timing solution, understand the energy-dependent amplitude
of the modulation, and investigate the spectral features of the source. We performed extensive
high-resolution and broadband periodicity searches in the new observations, using the combined
photons of the three EPIC cameras and allowing for moderate changes of pulsed fraction and the optimal
energy range for detection. A deep $4\sigma$ upper limit of $1.33(6)\%$ for modulations in the relevant
frequency range conservatively rules out the candidate period previously reported. Blind searches
revealed no other periodic signal above the $1.5\%$ level $(3\sigma$) in any of the four new observations.
While theoretical models fall short at physically describing the complex energy distribution
of the source, best-fit X-ray spectral parameters are obtained for a fully or partially ionized
neutron star hydrogen atmosphere model with $B=10^{13}$ G, modified by a broad Gaussian absorption
line at $385\pm10$ eV. The deep limits from the timing analysis disfavour equally well-fit double
temperature blackbody models where both the star surface and small hotspots contribute to the X-ray
flux of the source. We identified a low significance ($1\sigma$) temporal trend on the parameters
of the source in the analysis of RGS data dating back to 2002, which may be explained by unaccounted
calibration issues and spectral model uncertainties. The new dataset also shows no evidence of
the previously reported narrow absorption feature at $\sim570$ eV, whose possible transient nature
disfavours an atmospheric origin.
