We present synthetic dust polarization maps of simulated molecular clouds (MCs) with the goal to
systematically explore the origin of the relative orientation of the magnetic field ($\bf{B}$)
with respect to the MC sub-structures identified in density ($n$; 3D) and column density ($N$; 2D).
The polarization maps are generated with the radiative transfer code POLARIS, including self-consistently
calculated efficiencies for radiative torque alignment. The MCs are formed in two sets of 3D MHD
simulations: in (i) colliding flows (CF), and (ii) the SILCC-Zoom simulations. In 3D, for the CF
simulations with an initial field strength below $\sim$5 $\mu$G, $\bf{B}$ is oriented parallel
or randomly with respect to the $n$-structures. For CF runs with stronger initial fields and all
SILCC-Zoom simulations, which have an initial field strength of 3 $\mu$G, a flip from parallel to
perpendicular orientation occurs at high densities of $n_\text{trans}$ $\simeq$ 10$^2$ - 10$^3$
cm$^{-3}$. We suggest that this flip happens if the MC's mass-to-flux ratio, $\mu$, is close to or
below the critical value of 1. This corresponds to a field strength around 3 - 5 $\mu$G. In 2D, we use
the Projected Rayleigh Statistics (PRS) to study the orientation of $\bf{B}$. If present, the flip
in orientation occurs at $N_\text{trans}$ $\simeq$ 10$^{21 - 21.5}$ cm$^{-2}$, similar to the
observed transition value from sub- to supercritical magnetic fields in the ISM. However, projection
effects can reduce the power of the PRS method: Depending on the MC or LOS, the projected maps of the
SILCC-Zoom simulations do not always show the flip, although expected from the 3D morphology. Such
projection effects can explain the variety of recently observed field configurations, in particular
within a single MC. Finally, we do not find a correlation between the observed orientation of $\bf{B}$
and the $N$-PDF.
