We present $81$ near-infrared (NIR) spectra of $30$ Type II supernovae (SNe II) from the Carnegie
Supernova Project-II (CSP-II), the largest such dataset published to date. We identify a number
of NIR features and characterize their evolution over time. The NIR spectroscopic properties of
SNe II fall into two distinct groups. This classification is first based on the strength of the He
I $\lambda1.083\,\mu$m absorption during the plateau phase; SNe II are either significantly above
(spectroscopically strong) or below $50$ angstroms (spectroscopically weak) in pseudo equivalent
width. However between the two groups, other properties, such as the timing of CO formation and the
presence of Sr II, are also observed. Most surprisingly, the distinct weak and strong NIR spectroscopic
classes correspond to SNe II with slow and fast declining light curves, respectively. These two
photometric groups match the modern nomenclature of SNe IIP and IIL. Including NIR spectra previously
published, 18 out of 19 SNe II follow this slow declining-spectroscopically weak and fast declining-spectroscopically
strong correspondence. This is in apparent contradiction to the recent findings in the optical
that slow and fast decliners show a continuous distribution of properties. The weak SNe II show a
high-velocity component of helium that may be caused by a thermal excitation from a reverse-shock
created by the outer ejecta interacting with the red supergiant wind, but the origin of the observed
dichotomy is not understood. Further studies are crucial in determining whether the apparent differences
in the NIR are due to distinct physical processes or a gap in the current data set.
