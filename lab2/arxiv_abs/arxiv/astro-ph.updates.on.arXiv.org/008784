We present results from a quantitative spectroscopic analysis conducted on archival Keck/HIRES
high-resolution spectra from the California-$Kepler$ Survey (CKS) sample of transiting planetary
host stars identified from the $Kepler$ mission. The spectroscopic analysis was based on a carefully
selected set of Fe I and Fe II lines, resulting in precise values for the stellar parameters of effective
temperature (T$_{\rm eff}$) and surface gravity (log $g$). Combining the stellar parameters with
$Gaia$ DR2 parallaxes and precise distances, we derived both stellar and planetary radii for our
sample, with a median internal uncertainty of 2.8$\%$ in the stellar radii and 3.7$\%$ in the planetary
radii. An investigation into the distribution of planetary radii confirmed the bimodal nature
of this distribution for the small radius planets found in previous studies, with peaks at: $\sim$1.47
$\pm$ 0.05 R$_{\oplus}$ and $\sim$2.72 $\pm$ 0.10 R$_{\oplus}$, with a gap at $\sim$ 1.9R$_{\oplus}$.
Previous studies that modeled planetary formation that is dominated by photo-evaporation predicted
this bimodal radii distribution and the presence of a radius gap, or photo-evaporation valley.
Our results are in overall agreement with these models. The high internal precision achieved here
in the derived planetary radii clearly reveal the presence of a slope in the photo-evaporation valley
for the CKS sample, indicating that the position of the radius gap decreases with orbital period;
this decrease was fit by a power law of the form R$_{pl}$ $\propto$ P$^{-0.11}$, which is consistent
with photo-evaporation and Earth-like core composition models of planet formation.
