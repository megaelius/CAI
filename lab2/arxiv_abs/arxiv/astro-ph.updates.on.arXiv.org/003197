In June 2015, the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar 3C 279 underwent an extremely bright gamma-ray flare,
with an increase of the flux above 100 MeV by a factor 10 in less than 1 day, revealing an intrinsic variability
timescale of 2 minutes as detected by the Fermi-LAT. We present results of target of opportunity
observations with the H.E.S.S. experiment on this source over the nights around the peak of the outburst.
The H.E.S.S. data were analysed with mono and stereo chains. Thanks to the extreme brightness of
the source at GeV energies, it was possible to obtain data from Fermi-LAT, strictly simultaneous
to the H.E.S.S. observation. Simultaneous and quasi-simultaneous observations at optical and
X-ray energies were gathered to reconstruct the multi-wavelength spectrum helping to constrain
theoretical models describing the flare. The H.E.S.S. observation during the second night, using
H.E.S.S. II MONO data, lead to a clear detection of the source in about 3 hours of live-time. The H.E.S.S.
results were also used to derive limits on the Quantum Gravity scale under the assumption of Lorentz
Invariance Violation. Furthermore, since FSRQs possess intense optical photon fields surrounding
the central region near the black hole, the VHE data allows constraints on the location of the emitting
region to be derived in order that internal absorption be avoided. The detection of VHE emission
from the powerful flare of the FSRQ 3C 279 by H.E.S.S. II can provide unique insights into the physical
properties of this class of blazar, thanks in part to the presence of simultaneous and quasi-simultaneous
datasets at other wavelengths. Due to the high redshift of the source (z=0.54), it was also possible
to derive strong constraints on the Quantum Gravity mass scale.
