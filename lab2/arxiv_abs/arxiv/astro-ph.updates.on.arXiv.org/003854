Using infrared data from the Herschel Space Observatory and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA)
3 GHz observations in the COSMOS field, we investigate the redshift evolution of the infrared-radio
correlation (IRRC) for star-forming galaxies (SFGs) we classify as either spheroid- or disc-dominated
based on their morphology. The sample predominantly consists of disc galaxies with stellar mass
${\gtrsim}10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$, and residing on the star-forming main sequence (MS). After the
removal of AGN using standard approaches, we observe a significant difference between the redshift-evolution
of the median IR/radio ratio $\overline{q}_{\mathrm{TIR}}$ of (i) a sample of ellipticals, plus
discs with a substantial bulge component (`spheroid-dominated' SFGs) and, (ii) virtually pure
discs and irregular systems (`disc-dominated' SFGs). The spheroid-dominated population follows
a declining $\overline{q}_{\mathrm{TIR}}$ vs. $z$ trend similar to that measured in recent evolutionary
studies of the IRRC. However, for disc-dominated galaxies, where radio and IR emission should be
linked to star formation in the most straightforward way, we measure very little change in $\overline{q}_{\mathrm{TIR}}$.
This suggests that low-redshift calibrations of radio emission as an SFR-tracer may remain valid
out to at least $z\,{\simeq}\,1\,{-}\,1.5$ for pure star-forming systems. We find that the different
redshift-evolution of $q_{\rm TIR}$ for the spheroid- and disc-dominated sample is mainly due
to an increasing radio excess for spheroid-dominated galaxies at $z\,{\gtrsim}\,$0.8, hinting
at some residual AGN activity in these systems. This finding demonstrates that in the absence of
AGN the IRRC is independent of redshift, and that radio observations can therefore be used to estimate
SFRs at all redshifts for genuinely star-forming galaxies.
