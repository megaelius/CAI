Anisotropy in the arrival direction distribution of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) produced
by powerful sources is numerically evaluated. Nondetection of significant anisotropy at $\approx
10^{19}$ eV at present and in future experiments imposes upper limits on UHECR proton luminosity
of steady sources as a function of source redshift. The upper limits constrain the existence of typical
sources in the local universe and provide strong limits on the local density $\gtrsim 10^{-2.5}$
Mpc$^{-3}$ of $10^{19}$ eV UHECR sources, assuming average intergalactic magnetic field less
than $10^{-9}$ G. This isotropy, which is stronger than measured at the highest energies, may indicate
the transient generation of UHECRs. Our anisotropy calculations are applied for extreme high-frequency-peaked
BL Lac objects 1ES 0229+200, 1ES 1101-232, and 1ES 0347-121, to test the UHECR-induced cascade model,
in which beamed UHECR protons generate TeV radiation in transit from sources. The isotropy constraints
on the UHECR-induced cascade model are stronger than the cosmic-ray luminosity bounds obtained
from $\gamma$-ray observations, depending on the magnetic-field structure surrounding the Milky
Way. The effects of the Galactic and local extragalactic magnetic fields to the UHECR anisotropy
are investigated. If extragalactic magnetic fields are weak enough for UHECRs to remain beamed,
significant UHECR anisotropy from these blazars should be detectable by the Pierre Auger Observatory
unless the maximum energy of UHECRs is well below $10^{19}$ eV. If these are the sources of UHECRs
above $10^{19}$ eV, a local magnetic structure surrounding the Milky Way would have to produce the
observed isotropy at $\sim 10^{19}$ eV.
