We present the analysis of optical and near-infrared spectra of the only four z>6.5 quasars known
to date, discovered in the UKIDSS-LAS and VISTA-VIKING surveys. Our data-set consists of VLT/X-Shooter
and Magellan/FIRE observations of the z>6.5 quasars, and includes new deep VLT/X-Shooter observations
of the highest redshift quasar known to date (z=7.1). These are the best optical/NIR spectroscopic
data that are likely to be obtained for the z>6.5 sample using current 6-10 m facilities. We estimate
the black hole mass, the Eddington ratio, and the SiIV/CIV, CIII]/CIV, and FeII/MgII emission-line
flux ratios. We perform spectral modeling using a procedure that allows us to derive a probability
distribution for the continuum components and to obtain the quasar properties weighted upon the
underlying distribution of continuum models. The z>6.5 quasars show the same emission properties
as their counterparts at lower redshifts. The z>6.5 quasars host black holes with masses of ~10^9
M_sun that are accreting close to the Eddington luminosity (<log(L_Bol/L_Edd)>= -0.4+/-0.2),
in agreement with what has been observed for a sample of 4.0<z<6.5 quasars. By comparing the
SiIV/CIV and CIII]/CIV flux ratios with the results obtained from luminosity-matched samples
at z~6 and 2<z<4.5, we find no evidence of evolution of the line ratios with cosmic time. We
compare the measured FeII/MgII flux ratios with those obtained for a sample of 4.0<z<6.4
sources. The two samples are analyzed using a consistent procedure. The FeII/MgII flux ratio does
not show any evolution in the 4.0<z<7.1 redshift range. Under the assumption that the FeII/MgII
traces the Fe/Mg abundance ratio, this implies the presence of major episodes of chemical enrichment
in the quasar hosts in the first ~0.8 Gyr after the Big Bang.
