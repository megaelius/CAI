The eruptive cycles of dwarf novae (DN) are thought to be due to a thermal-viscous instability in
the accretion disk surrounding the white dwarf (WD). This model has long been known to imply a stress
to pressure ratio \alpha ~0.1 in outburst compared to \alpha ~ 0.01 in quiescence. Such an enhancement
in $\alpha$ has recently been observed in simulations of turbulent transport driven by the magneto-rotational
instability (MRI) when convection is present, without requiring a net magnetic flux. We independently
recover this result by carrying out PLUTO MHD simulations of vertically stratified, radiative,
shearing boxes with the thermodynamics and opacities appropriate to DN. The results are robust
against the choice of vertical boundary conditions. The thermal equilibrium solutions found by
the simulations trace the well-known S-curve in the density-temperature plane. We confirm that
the high values of \alpha ~ 0.1 occur near the tip of the hot branch of the S-curve, where convection
is active. However, we also present thermally-stable simulations at lower temperatures that have
standard values of \alpha ~ 0.03 despite the presence of vigorous convection. We find no simple relationship
between \alpha and the strength of the convection, as measured by the ratio of convective to radiative
flux. The cold branch is only very weakly ionized so, in the second part of this work, we studied the
impact of non-ideal MHD effects on transport. We include resistivity in the simulations and find
that the MRI-driven transport is quenched (\alpha ~ 0) below the critical density at which the magnetic
Reynolds number R_m \leq 10^4. This is problematic as X-ray emission observed in quiescent systems
requires ongoing accretion onto the WD. We verify that these X-rays cannot self-sustain MRI-driven
turbulence by photo-ionizing the disk and discuss possible solutions to the issue of accretion
in quiescence.
