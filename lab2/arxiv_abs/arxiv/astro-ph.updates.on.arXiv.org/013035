Aims. To demonstrate that INDICATE is a powerful spatial analysis tool which when combined with
kinematic data from Gaia DR2 can be used to robustly probe a cluster's star formation history. Methods.
We compare the dynamic and spatial distributions of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) at different evolutionary
stages in NGC 2264 using Gaia DR2 proper motion data and INDICATE. Results. Both the dynamic and spatial
behaviour of YSOs at different evolutionary stages are distinct. Dynamically, Class IIs predominately
have non-random trajectories which are consistent with known substructures, whereas Class IIIs
have random trajectories with no clear expansion or contraction patterns. Spatially, there is
a correlation between evolutionary stage and source concentration, with 69.4% (Class 0/I), 27.9%
(Class II) and 7.7% (Class III) found to be clustered. The proportion of YSOs clustered with objects
of the same class follows this trend also. Class 0/Is are found to be both more tightly clustered with
the general populous/ objects of the same class than Class IIs and IIIs by a factor of 1.2/ 4.1 and 1.9/
6.6 respectively. An exception to these findings is within 0.05 degrees of S Mon where Class IIIs
mimic the behaviours of Class IIs across the wider cluster region. Our results suggest (i) current
YSOs distributions are a result of dynamical evolution, (ii) prolonged star formation has been
occurring sequentially, (iii) stellar feedback from S Mon is causing YSOs to appear as more evolved
sources. Conclusions. INDICATE is a powerful tool with which to perform rigorous spatial analyses
as it - crucially - provides a quantitative measure of clustering behaviours. Our findings are consistent
with what is known about NGC 2264, effectively demonstrating that when combined with kinematic
data from Gaia DR2 INDICATE can be used to robustly study the star formation history of a cluster.
