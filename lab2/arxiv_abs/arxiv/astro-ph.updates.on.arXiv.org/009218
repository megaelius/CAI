The origin of sub-TeV gamma rays detected by the \textit{Fermi}-Large Area Telescope (LAT) from
the \textit{Fermi} Bubbles (FBs) at the Galactic center is still uncertain. In a hadronic model,
acceleration of protons and/or nuclei and their subsequent interactions with gas in the bubble
volume can produce the observed gamma rays. Recently the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory
reported an absence of gamma-ray excess from the Northern FB at $b\gtrsim 6^\circ$ Galactic latitude,
which resulted in flux upper limits in the energy range of $1.2-126$ TeV. These upper limits are consistent
with the gamma-ray spectrum measured by \textit{Fermi}-LAT at $|b|\ge 10^\circ$, where an exponential
cutoff at energies $\gtrsim 100$ GeV is evident. However, the FB gamma-ray spectrum at $|b|\le 10^\circ$,
without showing any sign of cutoff up to around 1 TeV in the latest results, remains unconstrained.
The upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will perform a Galactic center survey with unprecedented
sensitivity in the energy between 20 GeV and 300 TeV. In this work, we perform both morphological
and classic on/off analyses with planned CTA deep central and extended survey and estimate the sensitivity
of CTA to the FB hadronic gamma-ray flux models that best fit the spectrum at $|b|\le 10^\circ$ and
whose counterpart neutrino flux model best fits the optimistic neutrino spectrum from IceCube
Neutrino Observatory. We also perform sensitivity analysis with a future ground-based Cherenkov
detector the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). We find that CTA will be able to
discover or constrain the FB gamma-ray flux at $|b|\le 10^\circ$ in the $\approx$ 200 GeV -- 100 TeV
range with planned observation strategy, while LHAASO may constrain emission in the $\approx 100$~GeV
-- 100~TeV range if $\lesssim 10\%$ systematic uncertainties can be achieved.
