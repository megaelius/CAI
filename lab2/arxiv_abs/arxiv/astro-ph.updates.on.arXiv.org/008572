The near-Earth asteroid population suggests the existence of an inner Main Belt source of asteroids
that belongs to the spectroscopic X-complex and has moderate albedos. The identification of such
a source has been lacking so far. We argue that the most probable source is one or more collisional
asteroid families that escaped discovery up to now. We apply a novel method to search for asteroid
families in the inner Main Belt population of asteroids belonging to the X-complex with moderate
albedo. Instead of searching for asteroid clusters in orbital elements space, which could be severely
dispersed when older than some billions of years, our method looks for correlations between the
orbital semimajor axis and the inverse size of asteroids. This correlation is the signature of members
of collisional families, which drifted from a common centre under the effect of the Yarkovsky thermal
effect. We identify two previously unknown families in the inner Main Belt among the moderate-albedo
X-complex asteroids. One of them, whose lowest numbered asteroid is (161) Author, is ~3 Gyrs-old,
whereas the second one, whose lowest numbered object is (689) Zita, can be as old as the Solar System.
Members of this latter family have orbital eccentricities and inclinations that spread them over
the entire inner Main Belt, which is an indication that this family could be primordial, i.e. it formed
before the giant planet orbital instability. The vast majority of moderate-albedo X-complex asteroids
of the inner-Main Belt are genetically related, as they can be included into few asteroid families.
Only nine X-complex asteroids with moderate albedo of the inner Main Belt cannot be included in asteroid
families. We suggest that these bodies formed by direct accretion of the solids in the protoplanetary
disk, and are thus surviving planetesimals.
