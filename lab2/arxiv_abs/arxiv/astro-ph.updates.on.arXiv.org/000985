We present a catalog of the 26 currently known magnetars and magnetar candidates. We tabulate astrometric
and timing data for all catalog sources, as well as their observed properties at all wavelengths
from radio to gamma ray, particularly the spectral parameters of the quiescent X-ray emission.
We show histograms of the spatial and timing properties of the magnetars, comparing them with the
known pulsar population, and we investigate and plot possible correlations between their timing,
X-ray, and multiwavelength properties. We find best-fit values for the scale height of magnetars,
assuming they are exponentially distributed, to be 20-30 pc, with uncertainties of ~20%. These
values are smaller than those measured for OB stars, providing evidence that magnetars are born
from the most massive O stars. From the same fits, we find that the Sun lies ~13-20 pc above the Galactic
plane, consistent with previous measurements. We confirm previously identified correlations
between quiescent X-ray luminosity L_X and magnetic field B, as well as X-ray spectral power-law
index Gamma and B, and show evidence for an excluded region in a plot of L_X vs. Gamma. We also present
an updated kT versus characteristic age plot, showing magnetars and high-B radio pulsars are hotter
than lower-B neutron stars of similar age. Finally, we observe a striking difference between magnetars
detected in the the hard X-ray and radio bands; there is a clear correlation between the hard and soft
X-ray flux, whereas the radio-detected magnetars all have low soft X-ray flux suggesting, if anything,
that the two bands are anti-correlated. An online version of the catalog is located at this http URL
