How is mass distributed in the Universe? How does it compare with the distribution of light and stars?
We address these questions by examining the distribution of mass, determined from weak lensing
observations, and starlight, around $>10^5$ SDSS MaxBCG groups and clusters as a function of
environment and scale, from deep inside clusters to large cosmic scales of $22 h^{-1}$ Mpc. The observed
cumulative mass-to-light profile, $M/L (< r)$, rises on small scales, reflecting the increasing
$M/L$ of the central bright galaxy of the cluster, then flattens to a nearly constant ratio on scales
above $\sim 300 h^{-1}$ kpc, where light follows mass on all scales and in all environments. A trend
of slightly decreasing $M/L (r)$ with scale is shown to be consistent with the varying stellar population
following the morphology-density relation. This suggests that stars trace mass remarkably well
even though they represent only a few percent of the total mass. We determine the stellar mass fraction
and find it to be nearly constant on all scales above $\sim 300 h^{-1}$ kpc, with $M_{*}/M_{tot} \simeq
1.0\pm0.4\%$. We further suggest that most of the dark matter in the Universe is located in the large
halos of individual galaxies ($\sim 300$ kpc for $L^{*}$ galaxies); we show that the entire $M/L
(r)$ profile -- from groups and clusters to large-scale structure -- can be accounted for by the aggregate
masses of the individual galaxies (whose halos may be stripped off but still remain in the clusters),
plus gas. We use the observed mass-to-light ratio on large scales to determine the mass density of
the Universe: $\Omega_{m} = 0.24 \pm 0.02 \times b_{M/L}^{2} = 0.26 \pm 0.02.$
