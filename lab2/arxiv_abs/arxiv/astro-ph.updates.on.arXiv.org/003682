Context. The ability to automatically select scientifically-important transient events from
an alert stream of many such events, and to conduct follow-up observations in response, will become
increasingly important in astronomy. With wide-angle time domain surveys pushing to fainter limiting
magnitudes, the capability to follow-up on transient alerts far exceeds our follow-up telescope
resources, and effective target prioritization becomes essential. The RoboNet-II microlensing
program is a pathfinder project which has developed an automated target selection process (RoboTAP)
for gravitational microlensing events which are observed in real-time using the Las Cumbres Observatory
telescope network. Aims. Follow-up telescopes typically have a much smaller field-of-view compared
to surveys, therefore the most promising microlens- ing events must be automatically selected
at any given time from an annual sample exceeding 2000 events. The main challenge is to select between
events with a high planet detection sensitivity, aiming at the detection of many planets and characterizing
planetary anomalies. Methods. Our target selection algorithm is a hybrid system based on estimates
of the planet detection zones around a microlens. It follows automatic anomaly alerts and respects
the expected survey coverage of specific events. Results. We introduce the RoboTAP algorithm,
whose purpose is to select and prioritize microlensing events with high sensitivity to planetary
companions. In this work, we determine the planet sensitivity of the RoboNet follow-up program
and provide a working example of how a broker can be designed for a real-life transient science program
conducting follow-up observations in response to alerts, exploring the issues that will confront
similar programs being developed for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and other time
domain surveys.
