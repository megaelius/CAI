When creating asteroid regolith simulant, it is necessary to have a model of asteroid regolith to
guide and to evaluate the simulant. We created a model through evaluation and synthesis of the available
data sets including (1) the returned sample from Itokawa by the Hayabusa spacecraft, (2) imagery
from the Hayabusa and NEAR spacecraft visiting Itokawa and Eros, respectively, (3) thermal infrared
observations from asteroids, (4) the texture of meteorite regolith breccias, and (5) observations
and modeling of the ejecta clouds from disrupted asteroids. Comparison of the Hayabusa returned
sample with other data sets suggest the surficial material in the smooth regions of asteroids is
dissimilar to the bulk regolith, probably due to removal of fines by photoionization and solar wind
interaction or by preferential migration of mid-sized particles into the smooth terrain. We found
deep challenges interpreting and applying the thermal infrared data so we were unable to use those
observations in the model. Texture of regolith breccias do not agree with other data sets, suggesting
the source regolith on Vesta was coarser than typical asteroid regolith. The observations of disrupted
asteroids present a coherent picture of asteroid bulk regolith in collisional equilibrium, unlike
lunar regolith, HED textures, and the Itokawa returned sample. The model we adopt consists of power
laws for the bulk regolith in unspecified terrain (differential power index -3.5, representing
equilibrium), and the surficial regolith in smooth terrain (differential power index -2.5, representing
disequilibrium). Available data do not provide adequate constraints on maximum and minimum particle
sizes for these power laws, so the model treats them as user-selectable parameters for the simulant.
