We study the modelling of the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) for the eBOSS DR16 Emission Line
Galaxies (ELGs). Motivated by previous theoretical and observational studies, we consider different
physical effects that can change how ELGs populate haloes. We explore the shape of the average HOD,
the fraction of satellite galaxies, their probability distribution function (PDF), and their
density and velocity profiles. Our baseline HOD shape was fitted to a semi-analytical model of galaxy
formation and evolution, with a decaying occupation of central ELGs at high halo masses. We consider
Poisson and sub/super-Poissonian PDFs for satellite assignment. We model both NFW and particle
profiles for satellite positions, also allowing for decreased concentrations. We model velocities
with the virial theorem and particle velocity distributions. Additionally, we introduce a velocity
bias and a net infall velocity. We study how these choices impact the clustering statistics while
keeping the number density and bias fixed to that from eBOSS ELGs. The projected correlation function,
$w_p$, captures most of the effects from the PDF and satellites profile. The quadrupole, $\xi_2$,
captures most of the effects coming from the velocity profile. We find that the impact of the mean
HOD shape is subdominant relative to the rest of choices. We fit the clustering of the eBOSS DR16 ELG
data under different combinations of the above assumptions. The catalogues presented here have
been analysed in companion papers, showing that eBOSS RSD+BAO measurements are insensitive to
the details of galaxy physics considered here. These catalogues are made publicly available.
