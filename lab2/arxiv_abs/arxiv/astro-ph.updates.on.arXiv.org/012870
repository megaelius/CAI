We have studied the pressure and temperature dependence of solubility of nitrogen in methane and
ethane using vapor-liquid equilibrium simulations of binary mixtures of nitrogen in methane and
ethane for a range of pressures between 1.5 atm and 3.5 atm and temperatures between 90 K and 110 K,
thermodynamic conditions that may exist on the Saturn's moon, Titan. We find that the solubility
of nitrogen in methane increases linearly with pressure while the solubility of nitrogen in ethane
increases exponentially with pressure at temperature 90 K. Solubility of nitrogen in both methane
and ethane exhibits an exponential decrease with temperature at a pressure of 3 atm. The solubility
of nitrogen in methane is much larger compared to that in ethane in the range of pressure and temperature
studied here. Our results are in quantitative agreement with the available experimental measurements
of the solubility of nitrogen in methane and ethane. Furthermore, we find that the surface adsorption
of nitrogen increases with increasing pressure at temperature 90 K, while the adsorption free energy
increases with increasing pressure. Moreover, we find that the surface tension decreases linearly
with pressure for both nitrogen-methane and nitrogen-ethane systems. The rate of decrease of surface
tension with pressure for nitrogen-ethane system is much larger as compared to the nitrogen-methane
system. Finally, we find that the absorption of a nitrogen molecule into the liquid-phase from the
interface is diffusive and does not involve any appreciable energy barrier. Our results suggest
that homogeneous nucleation of bubbles is unlikely on Titan and the bubble formation in the lakes
on Titan must arise from heterogeneous nucleation of bubbles.
