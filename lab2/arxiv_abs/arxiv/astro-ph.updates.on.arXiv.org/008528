We present the results from new deep {\it Chandra} ($\sim410$~ks) and {\it Suzaku} ($\sim180$ ks)
observations of the merging galaxy cluster ZwCl\,0008.8+5215 ($z=0.104$). Previous radio observations
revealed the presence of a double radio relic located diametrically west and east of the cluster
center. Using our new {\it Chandra} data, we find evidence for the presence of a shock at the location
of the western relic, RW, with a Mach number $\mathcal{M}_{S_X}=1.48^{+0.50}_{-0.32}$ from the
density jump. We also measure $\mathcal{M}_{T_X}=2.35^{+0.74}_{-0.55}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{T_X}=2.02^{+0.74}_{-0.47}$
from the temperature jump, with {\it Chandra} and {\it Suzaku} respectively. These values are consistent
with the Mach number estimate from a previous study of the radio spectral index, under the assumption
of diffusive shock acceleration ($\mathcal{M}_{\rm RW}=2.4^{+0.4}_{-0.2}$). Interestingly,
the western radio relic does not entirely trace the X-ray shock. A possible explanation is that the
relic traces fossil plasma from nearby radio galaxies which is re-accelerated at the shock. For
the eastern relic we do not detect an X-ray surface brightness discontinuity, despite the fact that
radio observations suggest a shock with $\mathcal{M}_{\rm RE}=2.2^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$. The low surface
brightness and reduced integration time for this region might have prevented the detection. {\it
Chandra} surface brightness profile suggests $\mathcal{M}\lesssim1.5$, while {\it Suzaku}
temperature measurements found $\mathcal{M}_{T_X}=1.54^{+0.65}_{-0.47}$. Finally, we also
detect a merger induced cold front on the western side of the cluster, behind the shock that traces
the western relic.
