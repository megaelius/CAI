We report the discovery of a young (${\rm age} \sim 130~{\rm Myr}$), low-mass ($M \sim 1200~{\rm
M}_\odot$), metal-poor ($[{\rm Fe}/{\rm H}] \sim -1.1$) stellar association at a heliocentric
distance $D \approx 29~{\rm kpc}$, placing it far into the Milky Way halo. At its present Galactocentric
position $(R, z) \sim (23, 15)~{\rm kpc}$, the association is (on the sky) near the leading arm of
the gas stream emanating from the Magellanic cloud system, but is located $\approx 60^\circ$ from
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) center on the other side of the Milky Way disk. If we assume that the
cluster is co-located with HI gas in the stream, we directly measure the distance to the leading arm
of the Magellanic stream. The measured distance is inconsistent with stream predictions from models
of the LMC/SMC interaction and infall into the Milky Way that do not account for ram pressure and gas
interaction with Milky Way disk. The estimated age of the cluster is consistent with the time of last
passage of the leading arm gas through the Galactic midplane, and we therefore speculate that this
star-formation event was triggered by its the last disk midplane passage. Most details of this idea
remain a puzzle: the Magellanic stream has low column density, the Milky Way disk at this large radius
has low gas density, and the relative velocity of the leading arm gas and Milky Way gas is large. However
it formed, the discovery of a young stellar cluster in the Milky Way halo presents an interesting
opportunity for study. This cluster was discovered with Gaia astrometry and photometry alone,
but folow-up DECam photometry was crucial for measuring its properties.
