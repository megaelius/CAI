The bright star $\pi$ Men was chosen as the first target for a radial velocity follow-up to test the
performance of ESPRESSO, the new high-resolution spectrograph at the ESO's Very-Large Telescope
(VLT). The star hosts a multi-planet system (a transiting 4 M$_\oplus$ planet at $\sim$0.07 au,
and a sub-stellar companion on a $\sim$2100-day eccentric orbit) which is particularly appealing
for a precise multi-technique characterization. With the new ESPRESSO observations, that cover
a time span of 200 days, we aim to improve the precision and accuracy of the planet parameters and search
for additional low-mass companions. We also take advantage of new photometric transits of $\pi$
Men c observed by TESS over a time span that overlaps with that of the ESPRESSO follow-up campaign.
We analyse the enlarged spectroscopic and photometric datasets and compare the results to those
in the literature. We further characterize the system by means of absolute astrometry with Hipparcos
and Gaia. We used the spectra of ESPRESSO for an independent determination of the stellar fundamental
parameters. We present a precise characterization of the planetary system around $\pi$ Men. The
ESPRESSO radial velocities alone (with typical uncertainty of 10 cm/s) allow for a precise retrieval
of the Doppler signal induced by $\pi$ Men c. The residuals show an RMS of 1.2 m/s, and we can exclude
companions with a minimum mass less than $\sim$2 M$_\oplus$ within the orbit of $\pi$ Men c). We improve
the ephemeris of $\pi$ Men c using 18 additional TESS transits, and in combination with the astrometric
measurements, we determine the inclination of the orbital plane of $\pi$ Men b with high precision
($i_{b}=45.8^{+1.4}_{-1.1}$ deg). This leads to the precise measurement of its absolute mass
$m_{b}=14.1^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ M$_{Jup}$, and shows that the planetary orbital planes are highly
misaligned.
