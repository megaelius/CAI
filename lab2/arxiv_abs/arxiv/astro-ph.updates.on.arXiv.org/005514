We present a comparison of two samples of z>0.8 galaxy clusters selected using different wavelength-dependent
techniques and examine the physical differences between them. We consider 18 clusters from the
X-ray selected XMM-LSS distant cluster survey and 92 clusters from the optical-MIR selected SpARCS
cluster survey. Both samples are selected from the same approximately 9 square degree sky area and
we examine them using common XMM-Newton, Spitzer-SWIRE and CFHT Legacy Survey data. Clusters from
each sample are compared employing aperture measures of X-ray and MIR emission. We divide the SpARCS
distant cluster sample into three sub-samples: a) X-ray bright, b) X-ray faint, MIR bright, and
c) X-ray faint, MIR faint clusters. We determine that X-ray and MIR selected clusters display very
similar surface brightness distributions of galaxy MIR light. In addition, the average location
and amplitude of the galaxy red sequence as measured from stacked colour histograms is very similar
in the X-ray and MIR-selected samples. The sub-sample of X-ray faint, MIR bright clusters displays
a distribution of BCG-barycentre position offsets which extends to higher values than all other
samples. This observation indicates that such clusters may exist in a more disturbed state compared
to the majority of the distant cluster population sampled by XMM-LSS and SpARCS. This conclusion
is supported by stacked X-ray images for the X-ray faint, MIR bright cluster sub-sample that display
weak, centrally-concentrated X-ray emission, consistent with a population of growing clusters
accreting from an extended envelope of material.
