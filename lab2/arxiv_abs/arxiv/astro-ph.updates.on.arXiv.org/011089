The deuterium fractionation of water can serve as a tracer for the chemical and physical evolution
of water during star formation and can constrain the origin of water in Solar System bodies. We determine
the HDO/H$_2$O ratio in the inner warm gas toward three low-mass Class 0 protostars selected to be
in isolated cores, i.e., not associated with any cloud complexes. Previous sources for which the
HDO/H$_2$O ratio have been established were all part of larger star-forming complexes. Targeting
these isolated protostars allows comparison of the water chemistry in isolated and clustered regions
to determine the influence of local cloud environment. We present ALMA observations of the HDO $3_{1,2}$-$2_{2,1}$
and $2_{1,1}$-$2_{1,2}$ transitions at 225.897 GHz and 241.562 GHz along with the H$_2^{18}$O
$3_{1,3}$-$2_{2,0}$ transition at 203.407 GHz. The high angular resolution (0\farcs3-1\farcs3)
allow the study of the inner warm envelope gas. Model-independent estimates for the HDO/H$_2$O
ratios are obtained and compared with previous determinations in the warm gas toward low-mass protostars.
We detect the targeted water transitions toward the three sources with S/N > 5. We determine the HDO/H$_2$O
ratio toward L483, B335 and BHR71-IRS1 to be ($2.2\pm0.4$)$\times 10^{-3}$, ($1.7\pm0.3$)$\times
10^{-3}$, and ($1.8\pm0.4$)$\times 10^{-3}$, respectively, assuming $T_\mathrm{ex} = 124$
K. The degree of water deuteration of these isolated protostars are a factor of 2-4 higher relative
to Class 0 protostars that are members of known nearby clustered star-forming regions. The results
indicate that the water deuterium fractionation is influenced by the local cloud environment.
This effect can be explained by variations in either collapse timescales or temperatures, which
depends on local cloud dynamics and could provide a new method to decipher the history of young stars.
