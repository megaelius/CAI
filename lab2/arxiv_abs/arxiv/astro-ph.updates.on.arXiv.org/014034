Persistent tension between low-redshift observations and the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation
(CMB), in terms of two fundamental distance scales set by the sound horizon $r_d$ and the Hubble constant
$H_0$, suggests new physics beyond the Standard Model or residual systematics. We examine recently
updated distance calibrations from Cepheids, gravitational lensing time-delay observations,
and the Tip of the Red Giant Branch. Calibrating the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Type
Ia supernovae with combinations of the distance indicators, we obtain a joint and self-consistent
measurement of $H_0$ and $r_d$ at low redshift, independent of cosmological models and CMB inference.
In an attempt to alleviate the tension between late-time and CMB-based measurements, we consider
four extensions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The sound horizon from our different measurements
is $r_d=(137\pm3^{stat.}\pm2^{syst.})$~Mpc. Depending on the adopted distance indicators,
the $combined$ tension in $H_0$ and $r_d$ ranges between 2.3 and 5.1 $\sigma$. We find that modifications
of $\Lambda$CDM that change the physics after recombination fail to solve the problem, for the reason
that they only resolve the tension in $H_0$, while the tension in $r_d$ remains unchanged. Pre-recombination
extensions (with early dark energy or the effective number of neutrinos $\rm{N}_{\rm{eff}}=3.24
\pm 0.16$) are allowed by the data, unless the calibration from Cepheids is included. Results from
time-delay lenses are consistent with those from distance-ladder calibrations and point to a discrepancy
between absolute distance scales measured from the CMB (assuming the standard cosmological model)
and late-time observations. New proposals to resolve this tension should be examined with respect
to reconciling not only the Hubble constant but also the sound horizon derived from the CMB and other
cosmological probes.
