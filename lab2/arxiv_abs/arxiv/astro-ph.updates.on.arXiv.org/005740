Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) provides a unique all-sky catalog of 550'737 variable stars, of which 151'761
are Long Period Variable (LPV) candidates with G variability amplitudes larger than 0.2 mag. About
one fifth of the LPV candidates are Mira candidates, the majority of the rest being semi-regular
variable candidates. For each source, G, BP and RP photometric time series are published, together
with some LPV-specific attributes for the subset of 89'617 candidates with periods in G larger than
60 days. We describe this first Gaia catalog of LPV candidates, give an overview of its content, and
present various validation checks. Various samples of LPVs are used to validate the catalog: a sample
of well-studied very bright LPVs having AAVSO light curves concomitant with Gaia light curves,
a sample of Gaia LPV candidates with good parallaxes, the ASAS_SN all-sky catalog of LPVs, and the
OGLE-III catalogs of LPVs towards the Magellanic Clouds and the Galactic Bulge. The analyses of
these samples show a good agreement between Gaia DR2 and literature periods. The same is globally
true for bolometric corrections of M-type stars. The main contaminant to our DR2 catalog comes from
Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) in the Solar vicinity (within ~1 kpc), their number in the whole catalog
being only at the percent level. A cautious note is provided about parallax-dependent LPV attributes
published in the catalog. This first Gaia catalog of LPVs about doubles the number of known LPVs with
amplitudes larger than 0.2 mag, despite the conservative candidate selection criteria in order
to prioritize low contamination over high completeness, and despite the limited DR2 time coverage
compared to the long periods characteristic of LPVs. It also contains a small set of YSO candidates,
which offers the serendipitous opportunity to study these objects at an early stage of the Gaia data
releases.
