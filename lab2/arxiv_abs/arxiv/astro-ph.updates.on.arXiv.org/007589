We study an EUV confined ejection observed on 09 May 2012 in active region (AR) NOAA 11476. For the
analysis we use observations in multiple wavelengths (EUV, X-rays, H$\alpha$, and magnetograms)
from a variety of ground-based and space instruments. The magnetic configuration showed the presence
of two rotating bipoles, with decreasing magnetic flux, within the following polarity of the AR.
This evolution was present along some tens of hours before the studied event and continued even later.
A minifilament with a length of $\approx 30 \arcsec$ lay along the photospheric inversion line of
the largest bipole. The minifilament was observed to erupt accompanied by an M4.7 flare (SOL20120509T12:23:00).
Consequently, dense material, as well as twist, was injected along closed loops in the form of a very
broad ejection whose morphology resembles that of typical H$\alpha$ surges. We conclude that the
flare and eruption can be explained as due to two reconnection processes, one occurring below the
erupting minifilament and another one above it. This second process injects the minifilament plasma
within the reconnected closed loops linking the main AR polarities. Analyzing the magnetic topology
using a force-free model of the coronal field, we identify the location of quasi-separatix layers
(QSLs), where reconnection is prone to occur, and present a detailed interpretation of the chromospheric
and coronal eruption observations. In particular, this event, contrary to what has been proposed
in several models explaining surges and/or jets, is not originated by magnetic flux emergence but
by magnetic flux cancellation accompanied by the rotation of the bipoles. In fact, the conjunction
of these two processes, flux cancellation and bipole rotations, is at the origin of a series of events,
homologous to the one we analyze in this article, that occurred in AR 11476 from 08 to 10 May 2012.
