This paper continues a series in which we predict the main observable characteristics of exoplanets
based on their formation. In Paper I we described our global planet formation and evolution model.
In Paper II we studied the planetary mass-radius relationship. Here we present an extensive study
of the statistics of planetary luminosities during both formation and evolution. Our results can
be compared with individual directly imaged (proto)planets as well as statistical results from
surveys. We calculated three synthetic planet populations assuming different efficiencies of
the accretional heating by gas and planetesimals. We describe the temporal evolution of the planetary
mass-luminosity relation. We study the shock and internal luminosity during formation. We predict
a statistical version of the post-formation mass versus entropy "tuning fork" diagram. We find
high nominal post-formation luminosities for hot and cold gas accretion. Individual formation
histories can still lead to a factor of a few spread in the post-formation luminosity at a given mass.
However, if the gas and planetesimal accretional heating is unknown, the post-formation luminosity
may exhibit a spread of as much as 2-3 orders of magnitude at a fixed mass covering cold, warm, and hot
states. As a key result we predict a flat log-luminosity distribution for giant planets, and a steep
increase towards lower luminosities due to the higher occurrence rate of low-mass planets. Future
surveys may detect this upturn. During formation an estimate of the planet mass may be possible for
cold gas accretion if the gas accretion rate can be estimated. Due to the "core-mass effect" planets
that underwent cold gas accretion can still have high post-formation entropies. Once the number
of directly imaged exoplanets with known ages and luminosities increases, the observed distributions
may be compared with our predictions.
