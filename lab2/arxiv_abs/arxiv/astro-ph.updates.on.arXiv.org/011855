The grand-design spiral galaxy M~51 was observed at 40pc resolution in CO(1--0) by the PAWS project.
A large number of molecular clouds were identified and we search for velocity gradients in two high
signal-to-noise subsamples, containing 682 and 376 clouds. The velocity gradients are found to
be systematically prograde oriented, as was previously found for the rather flocculent spiral
M~33. This strongly supports the idea that the velocity gradients reflect cloud rotation, rather
than more random dynamical forces, such as turbulence. Not only are the gradients prograde, but
their $\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}$ coefficients follow
galactic shear in sign, although with a lower amplitude. No link is found between the orientation
of the gradient and the orientation of the cloud. The values of the cloud angular momenta appear to
be an extension of the values noted for galactic clouds despite the orders of magnitude difference
in cloud mass. Roughly 30\% of the clouds show retrograde velocity gradients. For a strictly rising
rotation curve, as in M~51, gravitational contraction would be expected to yield strictly prograde
rotators within an axisymmetric potential. In M~51, the fraction of retrograde rotators is found
to be higher in the spiral arms than in the disk as a whole. Along the leading edge of the spiral arms,
a majority of the clouds are retrograde rotators. While this work should be continued on other nearby
galaxies, the M~33 and M~51 studies have shown that clouds rotate and that they rotate mostly prograde,
although the amplitudes are not such that rotational energy is a significant support mechanism
against gravitation. In this work, we show that retrograde rotation is linked to the presence of
a spiral gravitational potential.
