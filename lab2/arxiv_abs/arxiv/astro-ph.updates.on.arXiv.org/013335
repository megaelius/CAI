Recent observations of neutron stars with radio, X-rays and gravitational waves have begun to constrain
the equation of state for nuclear matter beyond the nuclear saturation density. To one's surprise,
there exist approximate universal relations connecting certain bulk properties of neutron stars
that are insensitive to the underlying equation of state and having important applications on probing
fundamental physics including nuclear and gravitational physics. To date, analytic works on universal
relations for realistic neutron stars are lacking, which may lead to a better understanding of the
origin of the universality. Here, we focus on the universal relations between the compactness (C),
the moment of inertia (I), and the tidal deformability (related to the Love number), and derive analytic,
approximate I-Love-C relations. To achieve this, we construct slowly-rotating/tidally-deformed
neutron star solutions analytically starting from an extended Tolman VII model that accurately
describes non-rotating realistic neutron stars, which allows us to extract the moment of inertia
and the tidal deformability on top of the compactness. We solve the field equations analytically
by expanding them about the Newtonian limit and keeping up to 6th order in the stellar compactness.
Based on these analytic solutions, we can mathematically demonstrate the O(10%) equation-of-state
variation in the I-C and Love-C relations and the O(1%) variation in the I-Love relation that have
previously been found numerically. Our new analytic relations agree more accurately with numerical
results for realistic neutron stars (especially the I-C and Love-C ones) than the analytic relations
for constant density stars derived in previous work. Our results provide a mathematical explanation
of the amount of universality for realistic neutron stars in the above universal relations.
