A key challenge in origins-of-life studies is estimating the abundances of species relevant to
the chemical pathways proposed to have contributed to the emergence of life on early Earth. Dissolved
nitrogen oxide anions (NO$_{X}^{-}$), in particular nitrate (NO$_{3}^{-}$) and nitrite (NO$_{2}^{-}$),
have been invoked in diverse origins-of-life chemistry, from the oligomerization of RNA to the
emergence of protometabolism. Recent work has calculated the supply of NO$_{X}^{-}$ from the prebiotic
atmosphere to the ocean, and reported steady-state [NO$_{X}^{-}$] to be high across all plausible
parameter space. These findings rest on the assumption that NO$_{X}^{-}$ is stable in natural waters
unless processed at a hydrothermal vent. Here, we show that NO$_{X}^{-}$ is unstable in the reducing
environment of early Earth. Sinks due to UV photolysis and reactions with reduced iron (Fe$^{2+}$)
suppress [NO$_{X}^{-}$] by several orders of magnitude relative to past predictions. For pH$=6.5-8$
and $T=0-50^\circ$C, we find that it is most probable that NO$_{X}^{-}$]$<1~\mu$M in the prebiotic
ocean. On the other hand, prebiotic ponds with favorable drainage characteristics may have sustained
[NO$_{X}^{-}$]$\geq 1~\mu$M. As on modern Earth, most NO$_{X}^{-}$ on prebiotic Earth should
have been present as NO$_{3}^{-}$, due to its much greater stability. These findings inform the
kind of prebiotic chemistries that would have been possible on early Earth. We discuss the implications
for proposed prebiotic chemistries, and highlight the need for further studies of NO$_{X}^{-}$
kinetics to reduce the considerable uncertainties in predicting [NO$_{X}^{-}$] on early Earth.
