We report multi-color optical imaging and polarimetry observations of the afterglow of the first
TeV- detected gamma-ray burst, GRB 190114C, using RINGO3 and MASTER II polarimeters. Observations
begin 31 s after the onset of the GRB and continue until $\sim 7000\,$s post-burst. The light curves
reveal a chromatic break at $\sim 400- 500\,$s, with initial temporal decay $\alpha = 1.669 \pm 0.013$
flattening to $\alpha \sim 1$ post-break, which we model as a combination of reverse and forward-shock
components, with magnetization parameter $R_{\rm B} \sim 70$. The observed polarization degree
decreases from $7.7 \pm 1.1\%$ to $2-4\%$ during $52-109\,$s post-burst and remains steady at this
level for the subsequent $\sim 2000$-s, at constant position angle. Broadband spectral energy
distribution modeling of the afterglow confirms GRB 190114C is highly obscured (A$_{\rm v, HG}
= 1.49 \pm 0.12 \,$mag; N$_{\rm H, HG}= (9.0 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{22}\,$cm$^{-2}$). We interpret
the measured afterglow polarization as intrinsically low and dominated by dust, in contrast to
${\rm P} >10\%$ measured previously for other GRB reverse shocks, with a small contribution from
polarized prompt photons in the first minute. We test whether 1st and higher-order inverse Compton
scattering in a magnetized reverse shock can explain the low optical polarization and the sub-TeV
emission but conclude neither is explained in the reverse shock Inverse Compton model. Instead,
the unexpectedly low intrinsic polarization degree in GRB 190114C can be explained if large-scale
jet magnetic fields are distorted on timescales prior to reverse shock emission.
