We present results from a 12-orbit, 2-epoch HST H$\alpha$ emission line survey of the Andromeda
Galaxy that overlaps the footprint of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey.
Out of $\sim$2 million sources detected in each epoch, we find 552 (542) classical Be stars and 8429
(8556) normal B-type stars in epoch # 1 (epoch # 2), yielding an overall fractional Be content of 6.15%
$\pm$0.26% (5.96% $\pm$0.25%). Using PHAT photometry, we find that the fractional Be content decreased
with spectral sub-type from $\sim$23.6% $\pm$2.0% ($\sim$23.9% $\pm$2.0%) for B0-type stars
to $\sim$3.1% $\pm$0.34% ($\sim$3.4% $\pm$0.35%) for B8-type stars in epoch # 1 (epoch # 2). Compared
to the SMC, Be stars are 2.8x rarer in M31 for the earliest sub-types. Our data provide confirmation
that the fractional Be content in more metal rich environments (the Milky Way and M31) is lower than
that observed in metal poor environments (LMC and SMC). We observe a clear population of cluster
Be stars at early fractional main sequence lifetimes, indicating that a subset of Be stars emerge
onto the ZAMS as rapid rotators. Our data indicate no clear change in the frequency of early-type
Be stars in M31 and Milky Way, despite their different metallicity, which may reflect that the Be
phenomenon is enhanced with evolutionary age. Interestingly, the rate of disk-loss or disk-regeneration
episodes we observe between our two epoch Be sample, 22% $\pm$ 2% yr$^{-1}$, is similar to observed
for NGC 3766 (17.3 $\pm$ 3% yr$^{-1}$) and 6 other Galactic clusters (20.5 $\pm$ 4.5% yr$^{-1}$),
assuming these latter transient fractions scale by a linear rate. Finally, we observed a similar
number of disk-loss events (57) as disk-renewal events (43), which was unexpected as disk dissipation
time-scales can be $\sim$2x the typical time-scales for disk build-up phases.
