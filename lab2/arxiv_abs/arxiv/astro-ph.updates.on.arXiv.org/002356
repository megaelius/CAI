We present the first magnetohydrodynamic model of the stellar chromospheric heating and acceleration
of the outer atmospheres of cool evolved stars, using alpha Tau as a case study. We used a 1.5D MHD code
with a generalized Ohm's law that accounts for the effects of partial ionization in the stellar atmosphere
to study Alfven wave dissipation and wave reflection. We have demonstrated that due to inclusion
of the effects of ion-neutral collisions in magnetized weakly ionized chromospheric plasma on
resistivity and the appropriate grid resolution, the numerical resistivity becomes 1-2 orders
of magnitude smaller than the physical resistivity. The motions introduced by non-linear transverse
Alfven waves can explain non-thermally broadened and non-Gaussian profiles of optically thin
UV lines forming in the stellar chromosphere of alpha Tau and other late-type giant and supergiant
stars. The calculated heating rates in the stellar chromosphere due to resistive (Joule) dissipation
of electric currents, induced by upward propagating non-linear Alfven waves, are consistent with
observational constraints on the net radiative losses in UV lines and the continuum from alpha Tau.
At the top of the chromosphere, Alfven waves experience significant reflection, producing downward
propagating transverse waves that interact with upward propagating waves and produce velocity
shear in the chromosphere. Our simulations also suggest that momentum deposition by non-linear
Alfven waves becomes significant in the outer chromosphere at 1 stellar radius from the photosphere.
The calculated terminal velocity and the mass loss rate are consistent with the observationally
derived wind properties in alpha Tau.
