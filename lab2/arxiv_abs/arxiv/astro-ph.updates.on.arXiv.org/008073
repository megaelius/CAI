We show that the integral method used to prove the no-hair theorem for Black Holes (BH's) in spherically
symmetric and static spacetimes within the framework of general relativity with matter composed
by a complex-valued scalar-field does not lead to a straightforward conclusion about the absence
of hair in the stationary and rotating (axisymmetric) scenario. We argue that such a failure can
be used to justify in a simple and heuristic way the existence of non-trivial boson clouds or hair
found numerically by Herdeiro and Radu [1,2] and analytically by Hod in the test field limit [3-5].
This is due to the presence of a contribution that is negative when rotation exists which allows for
an integral to vanish even when a non-trivial boson hair is present. The presence of such a negative
contribution that depends on the rotation properties of the BH is perfectly correlated with the
eigenvalue problem associated with the boson-field equation. Conversely, when the rotation is
absent the integral turns to be composed only by non negative (i.e. positive semidefinite) terms
and thus the only way it can vanish is when the hair is completely absent. This analysis poses serious
challenges and obstructions towards the elaboration of no-hair theorems for more general spacetimes
endowed with a BH region even when including matter fields that obey the energy conditions. Thus
rotating boson stars, if collapsed, may lead indeed to a new type of rotating BH, like the ones found
in [1,2]. In order to achieve this analysis we solve numerically the eigenvalue problem for the boson
field in the Kerr-BH background by imposing rigorous regularity conditions at the BH horizon for
the non-extremal case ($0<a<M$) which include the near extremal one in the limit $M\rightarrow
a$, as well as the small BH limit $M\rightarrow a\rightarrow 0$.
