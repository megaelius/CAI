Be stars are rapidly rotating B main sequence stars, which show line emission due to an outflowing
disc. By studying the evolution of rotating single star models, we can assess their contribution
to the observed Be star populations. We identify the main effects which are responsible for single
stars to approach critical rotation as functions of initial mass and metallicity, and predict the
properties of populations of rotating single stars. We perform population synthesis with single
star models of initial masses ranging between 3 and 30 solar masses, initial equatorial rotation
velocities between 0 and 600 kms$^{-1}$ at compositions representing the Milky Way, Large and Small
Magellanic Clouds. These models include efficient core-envelope coupling mediated by internal
magnetic fields and correspond to the maximum efficiency of Be star production. We predict Be star
fractions and the positions of fast rotating stars in the colour-magnitude diagram. We identify
stellar wind mass-loss and the convective core mass fraction as the key parameters which determine
the time dependance of the stellar rotation rates. Using empirical distributions of initial rotational
velocities,our single star models can reproduce the trends observed in Be star fractions with mass
and metallicity. However,they fail to produce a significant number of stars rotating very close
to critical. We also find that rapidly rotating Be stars in the Magellanic Clouds should have significant
surface nitrogen enrichments, which may be in conflict with abundance determinations of Be stars.
Single star evolution may explain the high number of Be stars if 70 to 80% of critical rotationwould
be sufficient to produce the Be phenomenon. However even in this case, the unexplained presence
of many Be stars far below the cluster turn-off indicates the importance of the binary channel for
Be star production.
