We study the orientations of satellite galaxies in redMaPPer clusters constructed from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey at $0.1<z<0.35$ to determine whether there is any preferential tendency for
satellites to point radially toward cluster centers. We analyze the satellite alignment (SA) signal
based on three shape measurement methods (re-Gaussianization, de Vaucouleurs, and isophotal
shapes), which trace galaxy light profiles at different radii. The measured SA signal depends on
these shape measurement methods. We detect the strongest SA signal in isophotal shapes, followed
by de Vaucouleurs shapes. While no net SA signal is detected using re-Gaussianization shapes across
the entire sample, the observed SA signal reaches a statistically significant level when limiting
to a subsample of higher luminosity satellites. We further investigate the impact of noise, systematics,
and real physical isophotal twisting effects in the comparison between the SA signal detected via
different shape measurement methods. Unlike previous studies, which only consider the dependence
of SA on a few parameters, here we explore a total of 17 galaxy and cluster properties, using a statistical
model averaging technique to naturally account for parameter correlations and identify significant
SA predictors. We find that the measured SA signal is strongest for satellites with the following
characteristics: higher luminosity, smaller distance to the cluster center, rounder in shape,
higher bulge fraction, and distributed preferentially along the major axis directions of their
centrals. Finally, we provide physical explanations for the identified dependences, and discuss
the connection to theories of SA.
