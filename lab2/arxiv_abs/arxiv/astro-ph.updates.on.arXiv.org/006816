Context. Open clusters are very good tracers of the evolution of the Galactic disc. Thanks to Gaia,
their kinematics can be investigated with an unprecedented precision and accuracy. Aims. The distribution
of open clusters in the 6D phase space is revisited with Gaia DR2. Methods. The weighted mean radial
velocity of open clusters was determined, using the most probable members available from a previous
astrometric investigation that also provided mean parallaxes and proper motions. Those parameters,
all derived from Gaia DR2 only, were combined to provide the 6D phase space information of 861 clusters.
The velocity distribution of nearby clusters was investigated, as well as the spatial and velocity
distributions of the whole sample as a function of age. A high quality subsample was used to investigate
some possible pairs and groups of clusters sharing the same Galactic position and velocity. Results.
For the high quality sample that has 406 clusters, the median uncertainty of the weighted mean radial
velocity is 0.5 km/s. The accuracy, assessed by comparison to ground-based high resolution spectroscopy,
is better than 1 km/s. Open clusters nicely follow the velocity distribution of field stars in the
close Solar neighbourhood previously revealed by Gaia DR2. As expected, the vertical distribution
of young clusters is very flat but the novelty is the high precision to which this can be seen. The dispersion
of vertical velocities of young clusters is at the level of 5 km/s. Clusters older than 1 Gyr span distances
to the Galactic plane up to 1 kpc with a vertical velocity dispersion of 14 km/s, typical of the thin
disc. Five pairs of clusters and one group with five members are possibly physically related. Other
binary candidates previously identified turn out to be chance alignment.
