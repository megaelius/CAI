We describe the methodologies that, taking advantage of Gaia-DR1 and the Gaia-ESO Survey data,
enable the comparison of observed open star cluster sequences with stellar evolutionary models.
The final, long-term goal is the exploitation of open clusters as age calibrators. We perform a homogeneous
analysis of eight open clusters using the Gaia-DR1 TGAS catalogue for bright members, and information
from the Gaia-ESO Survey for fainter stars. Cluster membership probabilities for the Gaia-ESO
Survey targets are derived based on several spectroscopic tracers. The Gaia-ESO Survey also provides
the cluster chemical composition. We obtain cluster parallaxes using two methods. The first one
relies on the astrometric selection of a sample of bona fide members, while the other one fits the
parallax distribution of a larger sample of TGAS sources. Ages and reddening values are recovered
through a Bayesian analysis using the 2MASS magnitudes and three sets of standard models. Lithium
depletion boundary (LDB) ages are also determined using literature observations and the same models
employed for the Bayesian analysis. For all but one cluster, parallaxes derived by us agree with
those presented in Gaia Collaboration et al. (2017), while a discrepancy is found for NGC 2516; we
provide evidence supporting our own determination. Inferred cluster ages are robust against models
and are generally consistent with literature values. The systematic parallax errors inherent
in the Gaia DR1 data presently limit the precision of our results. Nevertheless, we have been able
to place these eight clusters onto the same age scale for the first time, with good agreement between
isochronal and LDB ages where there is overlap. Our approach appears promising and demonstrates
the potential of combining Gaia and ground-based spectroscopic datasets.
