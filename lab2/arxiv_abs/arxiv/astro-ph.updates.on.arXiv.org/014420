We explored a suite of high-resolution cosmological simulations from the First Billion Years Project
(FiBY) at $z \geq 6$. All substructures within the simulations have been identified with the SUBFIND
algorithm. From our analysis, two distinct groups of objects emerge. We hypothesise that the substructures
in the first group, which appear to have a high baryon fraction ($f_{\rm b} \geq 0.95$), are possible
infant GC candidates. Objects belonging to the second group have a high stellar fraction ($f_{\rm
star} \geq 0.95$) and show a potential resemblance to infant ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. The high
baryon fraction objects identified in this study are characterised by a stellar content similar
to the one observed in present-day GCs, but they still contain a high gas fraction ($f_{\rm gas} \sim
0.95$) and a relatively low amount of dark matter. They are compact, dense systems. Their sizes are
consistent with recent estimates based on the first observations of possible proto-GCs at high
redshifts. These types of infant GC candidates appear to be more massive and more abundant in massive
host galaxies, indicating that the assembly of galaxies via mergers may play an important role in
building several GC-host scaling relations. Specifically, we express the relation between the
mass of the most massive infant GC and its host stellar mass as $\log(M_{\rm cl}) = (0.31\pm0.15)\log(M_{\rm
*,gal} + (4.17\pm1.06)$. We also report a new relation between the most massive infant GC and the
parent specific star formation rate of the form $\log(M_{\rm cl}) = (0.85\pm0.30)\log(sSFR) +
\alpha$ that describes the data at both low and high redshift. Finally, we assess the present-day
GC mass (GC number) -- halo mass relation offers a satisfactory description of the behaviour of our
infant GC candidates at high redshift, suggesting that such a relation may be set at formation.
