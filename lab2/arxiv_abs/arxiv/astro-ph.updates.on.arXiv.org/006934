The neutral hydrogen (HI) gas is an important barometer of recent star formation and metal enrichment
activities in galaxies. We develop a novel statistical method for predicting the HI-to-stellar
mass ratio $f_{\mathrm{gas}}$ of galaxies from their stellar mass and optical colour, and apply
it to a volume-limited galaxy sample jointly observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Arecibo
Legacy Fast ALFA survey. We eliminate the impact of the Malmquist bias against HI-deficient systems
on the $f_{\mathrm{gas}}$ predictor by properly accounting for the HI detection probability of
each galaxy in the analysis. The best-fitting $f_{\mathrm{gas}}$ predictor, with an estimated
scatter of $0.272$ dex, provides excellent description to the observed HI mass function. After
defining an HI excess parameter as the deviation of the observed $f_{\mathrm{gas}}$ from the expected
value, we confirm that there exists a strong secondary dependence of the mass-metallicity relation
on HI excess. By further examining the 2D metallicity distribution on the specific star formation
rate vs. HI excess plane, we demonstrate that the metallicity dependence on HI is more fundamental
than that on specific star formation rate. In addition, we show that the environmental dependence
of HI in the local Universe can be effectively described by the cross-correlation coefficient between
HI excess and the red galaxy overdensity $\rho_{cc}{=}-0.18$. This weak anti-correlation also
successfully explains the observed dependence of HI clustering on $f_{\mathrm{gas}}$. Our method
provides a useful framework for learning HI gas evolution from the synergy between future HI and
optical galaxy surveys.
