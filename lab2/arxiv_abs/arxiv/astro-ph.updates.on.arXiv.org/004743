This is the second in a series of papers on preheating in inflationary models comprised of multiple
scalar fields coupled nonminimally to gravity. In this paper, we work in the rigid-spacetime approximation
and consider field trajectories within the single-field attractor, which is a generic feature
of these models. We construct the Floquet charts to find regions of parameter space in which particle
production is efficient for both the adiabatic and isocurvature modes, and analyze the resonance
structure using analytic and semi-analytic techniques. Particle production in the adiabatic
direction is characterized by the existence of an asymptotic scaling solution at large values of
the nonminimal couplings, $\xi_I \gg 1$, in which the dominant instability band arises in the long-wavelength
limit, for comoving wavenumbers $k \rightarrow 0$. However, the large-$\xi_I$ regime is not reached
until $\xi_I \geq {\cal O} (100)$. In the intermediate regime, with $\xi_I \sim {\cal O}(1 - 10)$,
the resonance structure depends strongly on wavenumber and couplings. The resonance structure
for isocurvature perturbations is distinct and more complicated than its adiabatic counterpart.
An intermediate regime, for $\xi_I \sim {\cal O} (1 - 10)$, is again evident. For large values of $\xi_I$,
the Floquet chart consists of densely spaced, nearly parallel instability bands, suggesting a
very efficient preheating behavior. The increased efficiency arises from features of the nontrivial
field-space manifold in the Einstein frame, which itself arises from the fields' nonminimal couplings
in the Jordan frame, and has no analogue in models with minimal couplings. Quantitatively, the approach
to the large-$\xi_I$ asymptotic solution for isocurvature modes is slower than in the case of the
adiabatic modes.
