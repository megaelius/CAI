We present the reconstruction of the hydrostatic mass profiles in 13 X-ray luminous galaxy clusters
that have been mapped in their X-ray and SZ signal out to $R_{200}$ for the XMM Cluster Outskirt Project
(X-COP). Using profiles of the gas temperature, density and pressure that have been spatially resolved
out to $0.9 R_{500}$, $1.8 R_{500}$, and $2.3 R_{500}$, respectively, we are able to recover the
hydrostatic gravitating mass profile with several methods and using different mass models. The
hydrostatic masses are recovered with a relative (statistical) error of 3% at $R_{500}$ and 6% at
$R_{200}$. We evaluate some of the systematic uncertainties to be in the order of 5% at both $R_{500}$
and $R_{200}$. A Navarro-Frenk-White profile provides the best-fit in 9 cases, with the remaining
four cases that do not show a statistically significant tension with it. The distribution of the
mass concentration follows the correlations with the total mass predicted from numerical simulations
with a scatter of 0.18 dex. We compare them with the estimates of the total gravitational mass obtained
through X-ray scaling relations, and from weak lensing and galaxy dynamics techniques, and measure
a substantial agreement with the results from scaling laws, from WL at both $R_{500}$ and $R_{200}$,
from cluster velocity dispersions, but a significant tension with the caustic masses that tend
to underestimate the hydrostatic masses by 40% at $R_{200}$. We also compare these measurements
with predictions from alternative models to CDM, like the Emergent Gravity and MOND scenarios,
confirming that the latter underestimates the hydrostatic masses by 40% at $R_{1000}$, with a decreasing
tension as the radius increases, and reaches $\sim$15% at $R_{200}$, whereas the former reproduces
$M_{500}$ within 10%, but overestimates $M_{200}$ by about 20%.
