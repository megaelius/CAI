Jupiter Family Comets (JFCs) are the evolutionary products of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs)
that evolve through the giant planet region as Centaurs and into the inner solar system. Through
numerical orbital evolution calculations following a large number of TNO test particles that enter
the Centaur population, we have identified a short-lived dynamical Gateway, a temporary low-eccentricity
orbit exterior to Jupiter through which the majority of Centaurs that become JFCs pass. We apply
an observationally-derived size distribution function to our modeled Centaur population and
an empirical fading law to our simulated JFCs to estimate the population in this Gateway region;
this produces results that are consistent with the observed number of objects in the Gateway. Currently,
the most notable occupant of the Gateway region is Centaur 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 (SW1), a
highly active, regularly outbursting Centaur; its present-day, very low eccentricity orbit was
established after a 1975 Jupiter conjunction and will continue until a 2038 Jupiter conjunction
doubles its eccentricity and pushes its semi-major axis out to its current aphelion. Within the
next 10,000 years, SW1 will likely evolve out of the Gateway region to become the largest JFC. The
JFC Gateway region coincides with a heliocentric distance range where the activity of all observed
cometary bodies increases significantly, so SW1's activity may be typical of the early evolutionary
processing experienced by most JFCs. Thus, the Gateway region, and its most notable occupant SW1,
is critical to both the dynamical and physical transition between Centaurs and JFCs.
