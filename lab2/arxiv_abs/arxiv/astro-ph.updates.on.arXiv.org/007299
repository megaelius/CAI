We use Dataflow Engines (DFE) to construct an efficient Wiener filter of noisy and incomplete image
data, and to quickly draw probabilistic samples of the compatible true underlying images from the
Wiener posterior. Dataflow computing is a powerful approach using reconfigurable hardware, which
can be deeply pipelined and is intrinsically parallel. The unique Wiener-filtered image is the
minimum-variance linear estimate of the true image (if the signal and noise covariances are known)
and the most probable true image (if the signal and noise are Gaussian distributed). However, many
images are compatible with the data with different probabilities, given by the analytic posterior
probability distribution referred to as the Wiener posterior. The DFE code also draws large numbers
of samples of true images from this posterior, which allows for further statistical analysis. Naive
computation of the Wiener-filtered image is impractical for large datasets, as it scales as $n^3$,
where $n$ is the number of pixels. We use a messenger field algorithm, which is well suited to a DFE
implementation, to draw samples from the Wiener posterior, that is, with the correct probability
we draw samples of noiseless images that are compatible with the observed noisy image. The Wiener-filtered
image can be obtained by a trivial modification of the algorithm. We demonstrate a lower bound on
the speed-up, from drawing 10$^5$ samples of a 128$^2$ image, of 11.3 ${\pm}$ 0.8 with 8 DFEs in a 1U
MPC-X box when compared with a 1U server presenting 32 CPU threads. We also discuss a potential application
in astronomy, to provide better dark matter maps and improved determination of the parameters of
the Universe.
