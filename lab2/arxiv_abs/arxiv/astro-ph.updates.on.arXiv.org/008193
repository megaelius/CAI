Early Mars climate research has well-defined goals (Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group 2018).
Achieving these goals requires geologists and climate modelers to coordinate. Coordination is
easier if results are expressed in terms of well-defined parameters. Key parameters include the
following quantitative geologic constraints. (1) Cumulative post-3.4 Ga precipitation-sourced
water runoff in some places exceeded 1 km column. (2) There is no single Early Mars climate problem:
the traces of $\ge$2 river-forming periods are seen. Relative to rivers that formed earlier in Mars
history, rivers that formed later in Mars history are found preferentially at lower elevations,
and show a stronger dependence on latitude. (3) The duration of the longest individual river-forming
climate was >(10$^2$-10$^3$) yr, based on paleolake hydrology. (4) Peak runoff production was
>0.1 mm/hr. However, (5) peak runoff production was intermittent, sustained (in a given catchment)
for only <10% of the duration of river-forming climates. (6) The cumulative number of wet years during
the valley-network-forming period was >10$^5$ yr. (7) Post-Noachian light-toned, layered sedimentary
rocks took >10$^7$ yr to accumulate. However, (8) an "average" place on Mars saw water for <10$^7$
yr after the Noachian, suggesting that the river-forming climates were interspersed with long
globally-dry intervals. (9) Geologic proxies for Early Mars atmospheric pressure indicate pressure
was not less than 0.012 bar but not much more than 1 bar. A truth table of these geologic constraints
versus currently published climate models shows that the late persistence of river-forming climates,
combined with the long duration of individual lake forming climates, is a challenge for most models.
