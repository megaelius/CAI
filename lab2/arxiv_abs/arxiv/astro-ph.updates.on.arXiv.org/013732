The molecular gas content of normal galaxies at z>4 is poorly constrained, because the commonly
used molecular gas tracers become hard to detect. We use the [CII]158um luminosity, recently proposed
as a molecular gas tracer, to estimate the molecular gas content in a large sample of main-sequence
star-forming galaxies at z=4.4-5.9, with a median stellar mass of 10^9.7 Msun, drawn from the ALMA
Large Program to INvestigate [CII] at Early times (ALPINE) survey. The agreement between molecular
gas masses derived from [CII] luminosity, dynamical mass, and rest-frame 850um luminosity, extrapolated
from the rest-frame 158um continuum, supports [CII] as a reliable tracer of molecular gas in our
sample. We find a continuous decline of the molecular gas depletion timescale from z=0 to z=5.9,
which reaches a mean value of (4.6+/-0.8)x10^8 yr at z~5.5, only a factor of 2-3 shorter than in present-day
galaxies. This suggests a mild enhancement of star formation efficiency toward high redshifts,
unless the molecular gas fraction significantly increases. Our estimates show that the rise in
molecular gas fraction as reported previously, flattens off above z~3.7 to achieve a mean value
of 63%+/-3 over z=4.4-5.9. This redshift evolution of the gas fraction is in line with the one of the
specific star formation rate. We use multi-epoch abundance matching to follow the gas fraction
evolution over cosmic time of progenitors of z=0 Milky Way-like galaxies in 10^13 Msun halos and
of more massive z=0 galaxies in 10^14 Msun halos. Interestingly, the former progenitors show a monotonic
decrease of the gas fraction with cosmic time, while the latter show a constant gas fraction from
z=5.9 to z~2 and a decrease at z<2. We discuss three possible effects, namely outflows, halt of gas
supplying, and over-efficient star formation, which may jointly contribute to the gas fraction
plateau of the latter massive galaxies.
