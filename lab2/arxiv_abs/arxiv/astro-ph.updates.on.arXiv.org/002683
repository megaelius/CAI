The Einstein spontaneous rates (A-coefficients) of Fe^+ lines have been computed by several authors,
with results that differ from each other up to 40%. Consequently, models for line emissivities suffer
from uncertainties which in turn affect the determination of the physical conditions at the base
of line excitation. We provide an empirical determination of the A-coefficient ratios of bright
[Fe II] lines, which would represent both a valid benchmark for theoretical computations and a reference
for the physical interpretation of the observed lines. With the ESO-VLT X-shooter instrument between
3,000 A, and 24,700 A, we obtained a spectrum of the bright Herbig-Haro object HH1. We detect around
100 [Fe II] lines, some of which with a signal-to-noise ratio > 100. Among these latter, we selected
those emitted by the same level, whose de-reddened intensity ratio is a direct function of the Einstein
A-coefficient ratios. From the same X-shooter spectrum, we got an accurate estimate of the extinction
toward HH1 through intensity ratios of atomic species, HI, recombination lines and H_2 ro-vibrational
transitions. We provide seven reliable A-ooefficient ratios between bright [Fe II] lines, which
are compared with the literature determinations. In particular, the A-coefficient ratios involving
the brightest near-infrared lines (12570A/16440A and 13209A/16440A) are better in agreement
with the predictions by Quinet et al. (1996) Relativistic Hartree-Fock model. However, none of
the theoretical models predicts A-coefficient ratios in agreement with all our determinations.
We also show that literature data of near-infrared intensity ratios better agree with our determinations
than with theoretical expectations.
