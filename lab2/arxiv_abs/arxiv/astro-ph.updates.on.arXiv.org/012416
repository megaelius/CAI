Observations of the Sun as a star have been key to guiding models of stellar atmospheres and additionally
provide useful insights on the effects of granulation and stellar activity on radial velocity measurements.
Most high resolution solar atlases contain telluric lines that span the optical and limit the spectral
regions useful for analysis. We present here a telluric-corrected solar atlas covering 0.5-1.0
micron derived from solar spectra taken with a Fourier Transform Spectrograph (FTS) at the Institut
f\"ur Astrophysik, G\"ottingen. This atlas is the highest resolution spectrum with a wavelength
calibration precise to +/-10 m/s across this 500 nm spectral window. We find that the atlas matches
to within 3% of the telluric-corrected Kitt Peak atlas in regions containing telluric absorption
weaker than 50% in transmission. The telluric component of the spectral data is fit with a semi-empirical
model composed of Lorentz profiles initialized to the HITRAN parameters for each absorption feature.
Comparisons between the best-fit telluric parameters describing the Lorentz profile for each
absorption feature to the original HITRAN values in general show excellent agreement considering
the effects atmospheric pressure and temperature have on our final parameters. However, we identify
a small subset of absorption features with larger offsets relative to the catalogued line parameters.
We make our final solar atlas available online. We additionally make available the telluric spectra
extracted from the data that, given the high resolution of the spectrum, would be useful for studying
the time evolution of telluric line shapes and their impact on Doppler measurements.
