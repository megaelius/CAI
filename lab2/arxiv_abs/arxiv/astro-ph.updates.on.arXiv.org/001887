We study particle dynamics in self-gravitating gaseous discs with a simple cooling law prescription
via two-dimensional simulations in the shearing sheet approximation. It is well known that structures
arising in the gaseous component of the disc due to a gravitational instability can have a significant
effect on the evolution of dust particles. Previous results have shown that spiral density waves
can be highly efficient at collecting dust particles, creating significant local over-densities
of particles. The degree of such concentrations has been shown to be dependent on two parameters:
the size of the dust particles and the rate of gas cooling. We expand on these findings, including
the self-gravity of dust particles, to see how these particle over-densities evolve. We use the
PENCIL CODE to solve the local shearing sheet equations for gas on a fixed grid together with the equations
of motion for solids coupled to the gas through an aerodynamic drag force. We find that the enhancements
in the surface density of particles in spiral density wave crests can reach levels high enough to
allow the solid component of the disc to collapse under its own self-gravity. This produces many
gravitationally bound collections of particles within the spiral structure. The total mass contained
in bound structures appears nearly independent of the cooling time, suggesting that the formation
of planetesimals through dust particle trapping by self-gravitating density waves may be possible
at a larger range of radii within a disc than previously thought. So, density waves due to gravitational
instabilities in the early stages of star formation may provide excellent sites for the rapid formation
of many large, planetesimal-sized objects.
