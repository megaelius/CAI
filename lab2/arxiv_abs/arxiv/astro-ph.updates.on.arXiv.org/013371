Redshift-space clustering distortions provide one of the most powerful probes to test the gravity
theory on the largest cosmological scales. We perform a systematic validation study of the state-of-the-art
statistical methods currently used to constrain the linear growth rate from redshift-space distortions
in the galaxy two-point correlation function. The numerical pipelines are tested on mock halo catalogues
extracted from large N-body simulations of the standard cosmological framework. We consider both
the monopole and quadrupole multipole moments of the redshift-space two-point correlation function,
as well as the radial and transverse clustering wedges, in the comoving scale range $10<r[$\Mpch$]<55$.
Moreover, we investigate the impact of redshift measurement errors on the growth rate and linear
bias measurements due to the assumptions in the redshift-space distortion model. Considering
both the dispersion model and two widely-used models based on perturbation theory, we find that
the linear growth rate is underestimated by about $5-10\%$ at $z<1$, while limiting the analysis
at larger scales, $r>30$ \Mpch, the discrepancy is reduced below $5\%$. At higher redshifts, we
find instead an overall good agreement between measurements and model predictions. Though this
accuracy is good enough for clustering analyses in current redshift surveys, the models have to
be further improved not to introduce significant systematics in RSD constraints from next generation
galaxy surveys. The effect of redshift errors is degenerate with the one of small-scale random motions,
and can be marginalised over in the statistical analysis, not introducing any statistically significant
bias in the linear growth constraints, especially at $z\geq1$.
