Observations of different molecular lines in protoplanetary disks provide valuable information
on the gas kinematics, as well as constraints on the radial density and temperature structure of
the gas. With ALMA we have detected H13CO+ (J=4-3) and HC15N (J=4-3) in the HD97048 protoplanetary
disk for the first time. We compare these new detections to the ringed continuum mm-dust emission
and the spatially resolved CO (J=3-2) and HCO+ (J=4-3) emission. The radial distributions of the
H13CO+ and HC15N emission show hints of ringed sub-structure whereas, the optically thick tracers,
CO and HCO+, do not. We calculate the HCO+/H13CO+ intensity ratio across the disk and find that it
is radially constant (within our uncertainties). We use a physio-chemical parametric disk structure
of the HD97048 disk with an analytical prescription for the HCO+ abundance distribution to generate
synthetic observations of the HCO+ and H13CO+ disk emission assuming LTE. The best by-eye fit models
require radial variations in the HCO+/H13CO+ abundance ratio and an overall enhancement in H13CO+
relative to HCO+. This highlights the need to consider isotope selective chemistry and in particular
low temperature carbon isotope exchange reactions. This also points to the presence of a reservoir
of cold molecular gas in the outer disk (T < 10K, R > 200au). Chemical models are required to confirm
that isotope-selective chemistry alone can explain the observations presented here. With these
data, we cannot rule out that the known dust substructure in the HD97048 disk is responsible for the
observed trends in molecular line emission, and higher spatial resolution observations are required
to fully explore the potential of optically thin tracers to probe planet-carved dust gaps. We also
report non-detections of H13CO+ and HC15N in the HD100546 protoplanetary disk.
