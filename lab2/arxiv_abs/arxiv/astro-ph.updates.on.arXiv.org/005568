We report new interferometric images of cyclopropenylidene, c-C$_3$H$_2$, towards the young
protocluster OMC-2 FIR\,4. The observations were performed at 82 and 85 GHz with the NOrthern Extended
Millimeter Array (NOEMA) as part of the project Seeds Of Life In Space (SOLIS). In addition, IRAM-30m
data observations were used to investigate the physical structure of OMC-2 FIR\,4. We find that
the c-C$_3$H$_2$ gas emits from the same region where previous SOLIS observations showed bright
HC$_5$N emission. From a non-LTE analysis of the IRAM-30m data, the c-C$_3$H$_2$ gas has an average
temperature of $\sim$40K, a H$_2$ density of $\sim$3$\times$10$^{5}$~cm$^{-3}$, and a c-C$_3$H$_2$
abundance relative to H$_2$ of ($7\pm1$)$\times$10$^{-12}$. In addition, the NOEMA observations
provide no sign of significant c-C$_3$H$_2$ excitation temperature gradients across the region
(about 3-4 beams), with T$_{ex}$ in the range 8$\pm$3 up to 16$\pm$7K. We thus infer that our observations
are inconsistent with a physical interaction of the OMC-2 FIR\,4 envelope with the outflow arising
from OMC-2 FIR\,3, as claimed by previous studies. The comparison of the measured c-C$_3$H$_2$
abundance with the predictions from an astrochemical PDR model indicates that OMC-2 FIR\,4 is irradiated
by a FUV field $\sim$1000 times larger than the interstellar one, and by a flux of ionising particles
$\sim$4000 times larger than the canonical value of $1\times10^{-17}$~s$^{-1}$ from the Galaxy
cosmic rays, which is consistent with our previous HC$_5$N observations. This provides an important
and independent confirmation of other studies that one or more sources inside the OMC-2 FIR\,4 region
emit energetic ($\geq10$~MeV) particles.
