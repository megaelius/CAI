We present a method for comparing the H$\beta$ emission-line profiles of observed supermassive
black hole (SBHB) candidates and models of sub-parsec SBHBs in circumbinary disks. Using the approach
based on principal component analysis we infer the values of the binary parameters for the spectroscopic
SBHB candidates and evaluate the parameter degeneracies, representative of the uncertainties
intrinsic to such measurements. We find that as a population, the SBHB candidates favor the average
value of the semimajor axis corresponding to $\log(a/M) \approx 4.20\pm 0.42$ and comparable mass
ratios, $q>0.5$. If the SBHB candidates considered are true binaries, this result would suggest
that there is a physical process that allows initially unequal mass systems to evolve toward comparable
mass ratios (e.g., accretion that occurs preferentially onto the smaller of the black holes) or
point to some, yet unspecified, selection bias. Our method also indicates that the SBHB candidates
equally favor configurations in which the mini-disks are coplanar or misaligned with the binary
orbital plane. If confirmed for true SBHBs, this finding would indicate the presence of a physical
mechanism that maintains misalignment of the mini-disks down to sub-parsec binary separations
(e.g., precession driven by gravitational torques). The probability distributions of the SBHB
parameters inferred for the observed SBHB candidates and our control group of AGNs are statistically
indistinguishable, implying that this method can in principle be used to interpret the observed
emission-line profiles once a sample of confirmed SBHBs is available but cannot be used as a conclusive
test of binarity.
