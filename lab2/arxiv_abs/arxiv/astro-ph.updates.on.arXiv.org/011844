We present and release the full dataset for the Mass Assembly of Stellar Systems and their Evolution
with the SMA (MASSES) survey. This survey used the Submillimeter Array (SMA) to image the 74 known
protostars within the Perseus molecular cloud. The SMA was used in two array configurations to capture
outflows for scales $>$30$^{\prime\prime}$ ($>$9000 au) and to probe scales down to $\sim$1$^{\prime\prime}$
($\sim$300 au). The protostars were observed with the 1.3 mm and 850 $\mu$m receivers simultaneously
to detect continuum at both wavelengths and molecular line emission from CO(2-1), $^{13}$CO(2-1),
C$^{18}$O(2-1), N$_2$D$^+$(3-2), CO(3-2), HCO$^+$(4-3), and H$^{13}$CO$^+$(4-3). Some of
the observations also used the SMA's recently upgraded correlator, SWARM, whose broader bandwidth
allowed for several more spectral lines to be observed (e.g., SO, H$_2$CO, DCO$^+$, DCN, CS, CN).
Of the main continuum and spectral tracers observed, 84% of the images and cubes had emission detected.
The median C$^{18}$O(2-1) linewidth is $\sim$1.0 km s$^{-1}$, which is slightly higher than those
measured with single-dish telescopes at scales of 3000-20000 au. Of the 74 targets, six are suggested
to be first hydrostatic core candidates, and we suggest that L1451-mm is the best candidate. We question
a previous continuum detection toward L1448 IRS2E. In the SVS13 system, SVS13A certainly appears
to be the most evolved source, while SVS13C appears to be hotter and more evolved than SVS13B. The
MASSES survey is the largest publicly available interferometric continuum and spectral line protostellar
survey to date, and is largely unbiased as it only targets protostars in Perseus. All visibility
($uv$) data and imaged data are publicly available at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/full_MASSES/.
