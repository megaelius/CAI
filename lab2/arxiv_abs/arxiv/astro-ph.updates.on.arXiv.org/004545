This work demonstrates the possibility of magnetic field topology investigations using microwave
polarimetric observations. We study a solar flare of GOES M1.7 class that occurred on 11 February,
2014. This flare revealed a clear signature of spatial inversion of the radio emission polarization
sign. We show that the observed polarization pattern can be explained by nonthermal gyrosynchrotron
emission from the twisted magnetic structure. Using observations of the Reuven Ramaty High Energy
Solar Spectroscopic Imager, Nobeyama Radio Observatory, Radio Solar Telescope Network, and Solar
Dynamics Observatory, we have determined the parameters of nonthermal electrons and thermal plasma
and identified the magnetic structure where the flare energy release occurred. To reconstruct
the coronal magnetic field, we use nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) and potential magnetic field
approaches. Radio emission of nonthermal electrons is simulated by the GX Simulator code using
the extrapolated magnetic field and the parameters of nonthermal electrons and thermal plasma
inferred from the observations; the model radio maps and spectra are compared with observations.
We have found that the potential magnetic field approach fails to explain the observed circular
polarization pattern; on the other hand, the Stokes $V$ map is successfully explained by assuming
nonthermal electrons to be distributed along the twisted magnetic structure determined by the
NLFFF extrapolation approach. Thus, we show that the radio polarization maps can be used for diagnosing
the topology of the flare magnetic structures where nonthermal electrons are injected.
