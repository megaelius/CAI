The gas dynamics of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is largely controlled by non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) effects including Ohmic resistivity, Hall effect and ambipolar diffusion, among which the
role of Hall effect is the least explored and most poorly understood. In this series, we have included
all three non-ideal MHD effects in a self-consistent manner to investigate the role of Hall effect
on the PPD gas dynamics using local shearing-box simulations. In this first paper, we focus on the
inner region of PPDs where previous studies without including the Hall effect have revealed that
the inner disk up to ~10 AU is largely laminar with accretion driven by magnetocentrifugal wind.
We confirm this basic picture and show that the Hall effect introduces modest modifications to the
wind solutions, depending on the polarity of the large scale poloidal magnetic field B_0 threading
the disk. When B_0.Omega>0, horizontal magnetic field is further amplified, leading to stronger
disk wind (by ~50% or less in terms of wind-driven accretion rate). The enhanced horizontal field
also leads to much stronger large-scale Maxwell stress that contributes to a considerable fraction
of the wind-driven accretion rate. When B_0.Omega<0, horizontal magnetic field is reduced,
leading to weaker disk wind (by ~20%). More importantly, we find that when B_0.Omega>0, the range
of stability is enlarged, and one expects the laminar region to extend further to ~15 AU before the
magneto-rotational instability sets in, while for B_0.Omega<0, the laminar region extends
only to ~3 AU for typical PPD accretion rates. Scaling relations for the wind properties, especially
wind-driven accretion rate are provided for aligned and anti-aligned field geometries. Implications
for global disk evolution and planet formation are also briefly discussed.
