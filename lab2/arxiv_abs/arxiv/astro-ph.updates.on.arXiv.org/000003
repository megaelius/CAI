We present HST-COS spectra of ten quasars located behind M31, selected to investigate the properties
of gas associated with its extended disk and high velocity clouds (HVCs). The sightlines have impact
parameters ranging between b= 13 kpc and 112 kpc. No absorption is detected in the four sightlines
beyond b=57 kpc. Of the six remaining sightlines, all of which lie at b<32 kpc and within the N(HI)=
2E18 cm^{-2} boundary of the HI disk of M31, we detect low-ionization absorption at M31 velocities
along four of them (three of which include MgII absorption). We also detect MgII absorption from
an HVC. We find that along sightlines where both are detected, the velocity location of the low-ion
gas tracks the peak in 21 cm emission. High-ionization absorption is detected along the three inner
sightlines, but not along the three outer sightlines, for which CIV data exist. As inferred from
21 cm emission line maps, only one sightline may have a damped Ly-alpha system. This sightline has
b= 17.5 kpc, and we detect both low- and high-ion absorption lines associated with it. It is the strongest
single MgII2796 absorption line that we detect, with W_0(2796)=0.63 A. The impact parameters through
M31 are similar to the impact parameters of galaxies identified with MgII absorbers at redshifts
0.1<z<1.0 in a 2011 study by Rao et al. However, the M31 MgII2796 rest equivalent width values
are significantly smaller. In comparison, moderate-to-strong MgII absorption from Milky Way
gas is detected along all ten sightlines. Thus, this study indicates that M31 does not present itself
as an absorbing galaxy which is typical of higher-redshift galaxies inferred to give rise to moderate-strength
quasar absorption lines. M31 also appears not to possess an extensive large gaseous cross section,
at least not along the direction of its major axis. (Abridged.)
