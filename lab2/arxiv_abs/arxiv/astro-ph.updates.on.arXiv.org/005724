Nearly every massive galaxy harbors a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in its nucleus. SMBH masses
are millions to billions $M_{\odot}$, and they correlate with properties of spheroids of their
host galaxies. While the SMBH growth channels, mergers and gas accretion, are well established,
their origin remains uncertain: they could have either emerged from massive "seeds" ($10^5-10^6
M_{\odot}$) formed by direct collapse of gas clouds in the early Universe or from smaller ($100 M_{\odot}$)
black holes, end-products of first stars. The latter channel would leave behind numerous intermediate
mass black holes (IMBHs, $10^2-10^5 M_{\odot}$). Although many IMBH candidates have been identified,
none is accepted as definitive, thus their very existence is still debated. Using data mining in
wide-field sky surveys and applying dedicated analysis to archival and follow-up optical spectra,
we identified a sample of 305 IMBH candidates having masses $3\times10^4<M_{\mathrm{BH}}<2\times10^5
M_{\odot}$, which reside in galaxy centers and are accreting gas that creates characteristic signatures
of a type-I active galactic nucleus (AGN). We confirmed the AGN nature of ten sources (including
five previously known objects which validate our method) by detecting the X-ray emission from their
accretion discs, thus defining the first bona fide sample of IMBHs in galactic nuclei. All IMBH host
galaxies possess small bulges and sit on the low-mass extension of the $M_{\mathrm{BH}}-M_{\mathrm{bulge}}$
scaling relation suggesting that they must have experienced very few if any major mergers over their
lifetime. The very existence of nuclear IMBHs supports the stellar mass seed scenario of the massive
black hole formation.
