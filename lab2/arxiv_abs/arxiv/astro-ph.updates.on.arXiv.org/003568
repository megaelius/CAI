New and more reliable distances and proper motions of a large number of stars in the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric
Solution (TGAS) catalogue allow to calculate the local matter density distribution more precisely
than earlier. We devised a method to calculate the stationary gravitational potential distribution
perpendicular to the Galactic plane by comparing the vertical probability density distribution
of a sample of observed stars with the theoretical probability density distribution computed from
their vertical coordinates and velocities. We applied the model to idealised test stars and to the
real observational samples. Tests with two mock datasets proved that the method is viable and provides
reasonable results. Applying the method to TGAS data we derived that the total matter density in
the Solar neighbourhood is $0.09\pm 0.02 \text{M}_\odot\text{pc}^{-3}$ being consistent with
the results from literature. The matter surface density within $|z|\le 0.75 \text{kpc}$ is $42\pm
4 \text{M}_\odot\text{pc}^{-2}$. This is slightly less than the results derived by other authors
but within errors is consistent with previous estimates. Our results show no firm evidence for significant
amount of dark matter in the Solar neighbourhood. However, we caution that our calculations at $|z|
\leq 0.75$ kpc rely on an extrapolation from the velocity distribution function calculated at $|z|
\leq 25$ pc. This extrapolation can be very sensitive to our assumption that the stellar motions
are perfectly decoupled in R and z, and to our assumption of equilibrium. Indeed, we find that $\rho
(z)$ within $|z|\le 0.75$ kpc is asymmetric with respect to the Galactic plane at distances $|z|
= 0.1-0.4$ kpc indicating that the density distribution may be influenced by density perturbations.
