Interstellar grain mantles present in dense interstellar clouds are in constant exchange with
the gas phase via accretion and desorption mechanisms such as UV, X-ray photodesorption, cosmic
ray induced sputtering, grain thermal fluctuations, and chemical reaction energy release. The
relative importance of the various desorption mechanisms is of uttermost importance for astrophysical
models to constrain the chemical evolution in such high density dense cloud regions. In this experimental
work we investigated the sputtering yield as a function of ice mantle thickness, exposed to Xe ions
at 95MeV. The ion induced ice phase transformation and the sputtering yield were simultaneously
monitored by IR spectroscopy and mass spec- trometry, respectively. The sputtering yield is constant
above a characteristic ice layer thickness and starts to decrease below this thickness. An estimate
of the sputtering depth corresponding to this length can be evaluated. In these experiments the
measured desorption depth corresponds to 30 ice layers. Assuming an effective cylindrical shape
for the volume of sputtered molecules, the aspect ratio is close to unity; in the semi-infinite ice
film case this ratio is the diameter to height of the cylinder. This result shows that most ejected
molecules arise from a rather compact volume. The measured infinite thickness sputtering yield
for water ice mantles scales as the square of the ion electronic stopping power (Se). We expect that
the desorption depth dependence varies with Se^a , where a=0.5. Astrophysical models should take
into account the thickness dependence constraints of these ice mantles in the interface regions
when ices are close to their extinction threshold. In the very dense cloud regions, most of the water
ice mantles are above this limit for the bulk of the cosmic rays.
