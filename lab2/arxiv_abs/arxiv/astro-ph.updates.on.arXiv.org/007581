Quasars whose broad emission lines show temporal, bulk radial velocity (RV) shifts have been proposed
as candidate sub-parsec (sub-pc), binary supermassive black holes (BSBHs). We identified a sample
of 16 BSBH candidates based on two-epoch spectroscopy among 52 quasars with significant RV shifts
over a few rest-frame years. The candidates showed consistent velocity shifts independently measured
from two broad lines (H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ or Mg${\rm \,II}$) without significant changes in
the broad-line profiles. Here in the third paper of the series, we present further third- and fourth-epoch
spectroscopy for 12 of the 16 candidates for continued RV tests, spanning $\sim$5--15 yr in the quasars'
rest frames. Cross-correlation analysis of the broad H$\beta$ calibrated against [O${\rm\,III}]\,\lambda
5007$ suggests that 5 of the 12 quasars remain valid as BSBH candidates. They show broad H$\beta$
RV curves that are consistent with binary orbital motion without significant changes in the broad
line profiles. Their broad H$\alpha$ (or Mg${\rm \,II}$) lines display RV shifts that are either
consistent with or smaller than those seen in broad H$\beta$. The RV shifts can be explained by a $\sim$0.05--0.1
pc BSBH with an orbital period of $\sim$40--130 yr, assuming a mass ratio of 0.5--2 and a circular
orbit. However, the parameters are not well constrained given the few epochs that sample only a small
portion of the hypothesized binary orbital cycle. The apparent occurrence rate of sub-pc BSBHs
is $\lesssim$13$\pm$5% among all SDSS quasars, with no significant difference in the subsets with
and without single-epoch broad line velocity offsets. Dedicated long-term spectroscopic monitoring
is still needed to further confirm or reject these BSBH candidates.
