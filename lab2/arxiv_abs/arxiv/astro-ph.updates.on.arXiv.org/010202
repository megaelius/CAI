We present the discovery from TESS data of LTT 1445Ab. At a distance of 6.9 parsecs, it is the second
nearest transiting exoplanet system found to date, and the closest one known for which the primary
is an M dwarf. The host stellar system consists of three mid-to-late M dwarfs in a hierarchical configuration,
which are blended in one TESS pixel. We use follow-up observations from MEarth and the centroid offset
analysis in the TESS data validation report to determine that the planet transits the primary star
in the system. The planet has a radius 1.35 R_Earth, an orbital period of 5.35882 days, and an equilibrium
temperature of 428 K. With radial velocities from HARPS, we place a three-sigma upper mass limit
of 8.4 M_Earth on the candidate. The planet provides one of the best opportunities to date for the
spectroscopic study of the atmosphere of a terrestrial world. The presence of stellar companions
of similar spectral type may facilitate such ground-based studies by providing a calibration source
to remove telluric variations. In addition, we present a detailed characterization of the host
stellar system. We use high-resolution spectroscopy and imaging to rule out the presence of any
other close stellar or brown dwarf companions. Nineteen years of photometric monitoring of A and
BC indicates a moderate amount of variability, in agreement with the observed low-level, short-term
variability in the TESS light curve data. We derive a preliminary astrometric orbit for the BC pair
that reveals an edge-on and eccentric configuration. The presence of a transiting planet in this
system raises the possibility that the entire system is co-planar, which implies that the system
may have formed from the early fragmentation of an individual protostellar core.
