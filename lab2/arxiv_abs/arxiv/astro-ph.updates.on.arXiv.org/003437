The substellar companion HD206893b has recently been discovered by direct imaging of its disc-bearing
host star with the SPHERE instrument. We investigate the atypical properties of the companion,
which has the reddest near-infrared colours among all known substellar objects, either orbiting
a star or isolated, and we provide a comprehensive characterisation of the host star-disc-companion
system. We conducted a follow-up of the companion with adaptive optics imaging and spectro-imaging
with SPHERE, and a multiinstrument follow-up of its host star. We obtain a R=30 spectrum from 0.95
to 1.64 micron of the companion and additional photometry at 2.11 and 2.25 micron. We carried out
extensive atmosphere model fitting for the companions and the host star in order to derive their
age, mass, and metallicity. We found no additional companion in the system in spite of exquisite
observing conditions resulting in sensitivity to 6MJup (2MJup) at 0.5" for an age of 300 Myr (50 Myr).
We detect orbital motion over more than one year and characterise the possible Keplerian orbits.
We constrain the age of the system to a minimum of 50 Myr and a maximum of 700 Myr, and determine that
the host-star metallicity is nearly solar. The comparison of the companion spectrum and photometry
to model atmospheres indicates that the companion is an extremely dusty late L dwarf, with an intermediate
gravity (log g 4.5-5.0) which is compatible with the independent age estimate of the system. Though
our best fit corresponds to a brown dwarf of 15-30 MJup aged 100-300 Myr, our analysis is also compatible
with a range of masses and ages going from a 50 Myr 12MJup planetary-mass object to a 50 MJup Hyades-age
brown dwarf...
