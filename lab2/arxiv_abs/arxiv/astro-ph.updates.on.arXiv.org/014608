Dwarf galaxies (M*<10^9 Msun) are key drivers of mass assembly in high mass galaxies, but relatively
little is understood about the assembly of dwarf galaxies themselves. Using the New Horizon cosmological
simulation (40 pc spatial resolution), we investigate how mergers and fly-bys drive the mass assembly
and structural evolution of around 1000 field and group dwarfs up to z=0.5. We find that, while dwarf
galaxies often exhibit disturbed morphologies (30 and 50 per cent are disturbed at z=1 and z=3 respectively),
only a small proportion of the morphological disturbances seen in dwarf galaxies are driven by mergers
at any redshift (for 10^9 Msun, mergers drive only 20 per cent morphological disturbances). They
are instead primarily the result of interactions that do not end in a merger (e.g. fly-bys). Given
the large fraction of apparently morphologically disturbed dwarf galaxies which are not, in fact,
merging, this finding is particularly important to future studies identifying dwarf mergers and
post-mergers morphologically at intermediate and high redshifts. Dwarfs typically undergo one
major and one minor merger between z=5 and z=0.5, accounting for 10 per cent of their total stellar
mass. Mergers can also drive moderate star formation enhancements at lower redshifts (up to 5 times
at z=1), but this only accounts for 5 per cent of stellar mass in the dwarf regime given their infrequency.
Non-merger interactions drive significantly smaller star formation enhancements (around two
times), but their preponderance relative to mergers means they account for 10 per cent of stellar
mass in the dwarf regime.
