Although there is currently a debate over the significance of the claimed large scale anomalies
in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), their existence is not totally dismissed. In parallel
to the debate over their statistical significance, recent work has also focussed on masks and secondary
anisotropies as potential sources of these anomalies. In this work we investigate simultaneously
the impact of masked regions as well the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, the secondary anisotropy
most likely to affect these anomalies. Our work is an update of both Francis & Peacock 2010 and
Kim et al. 2012. We aim to identify trends in CMB data from different years and with different masks
treatments. We reconstruct the ISW signal due to 2MASS and NVSS galaxies, effectively reconstructing
the low-z ISW signal out to z ~ 1. We account for missing data using sparse inpainting techniques of
Abrial et al. 2008, Starck, Murtagh & Fadili 2010 and Starck, Fadili & Rassat 2013. We test
sparse inpainting of the CMB, Large Scale Structure and ISW and find it constitutes a bias-free reconstruction
method suitable to study large-scale statistical isotropy and the ISW effect. We focus on three
large-scale CMB anomalies: the low quadrupole, the quadrupole/octopole alignment and the octopole
planarity. After sparse inpainting, the low quadrupole becomes more anomalous, whilst the quadrupole/octopole
alignment becomes less anomalous. After subtraction of the ISW, the trend is that both the low quadrupole
and the quadrupole/octopole alignment have reduced significance, yet other hypotheses remain
possible as well (e.g. exotic physics). Our results also suggest that both of these previous anomalies
may be due to the quadrupole alone. The octopole planarity significance is reduced after inpainting
and after ISW subtraction, though it was not very anomalous to start with.
