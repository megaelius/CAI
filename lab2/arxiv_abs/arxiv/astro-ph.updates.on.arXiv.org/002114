Using our photometric observations taken between April 1996 and January 2013 and other published
data, we derive properties of the binary near-Earth asteroid (175706) 1996 FG3 including new measurements
constraining evolution of the mutual orbit with potential consequences for the entire binary asteroid
population. We also refined previously determined values of parameters of both components, making
1996 FG3 one of the most well understood binary asteroid systems. We determined the orbital vector
with a substantially greater accuracy than before and we also placed constraints on a stability
of the orbit. Specifically, the ecliptic longitude and latitude of the orbital pole are 266{\deg}
and -83{\deg}, respectively, with the mean radius of the uncertainty area of 4{\deg}, and the orbital
period is 16.1508 +\- 0.0002 h (all uncertainties correspond to 3sigma). We looked for a quadratic
drift of the mean anomaly of the satellite and obtained a value of 0.04 +\- 0.20 deg/yr^2, i.e., consistent
with zero. The drift is substantially lower than predicted by the pure binary YORP (BYORP) theory
of McMahon and Scheeres (McMahon, J., Scheeres, D. [2010]. Icarus 209, 494-509) and it is consistent
with the theory of an equilibrium between BYORP and tidal torques for synchronous binary asteroids
as proposed by Jacobson and Scheeres (Jacobson, S.A., Scheeres, D. [2011]. ApJ Letters, 736, L19).
Based on the assumption of equilibrium, we derived a ratio of the quality factor and tidal Love number
of Q/k = 2.4 x 10^5 uncertain by a factor of five. We also derived a product of the rigidity and quality
factor of mu Q = 1.3 x 10^7 Pa using the theory that assumes an elastic response of the asteroid material
to the tidal forces. This very low value indicates that the primary of 1996 FG3 is a 'rubble pile',
and it also calls for a re-thinking of the tidal energy dissipation in close asteroid binary systems.
