Radio sources are expected to have formed at high redshifts, producing an excess radiation background
above the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at low frequencies. Their effect on the redshifted
21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen is usually neglected, as it is assumed that the associated background
is small. Recently, an excess radio background above the level of the CMB has been proposed as one
of the possible explanations for the unusually strong 21-cm signal from redshift $z\sim 17$ reported
by the EDGES collaboration. As a result, the implications of a smooth and extremely strong excess
radio background on both the sky-averaged (global) 21-cm signal and its fluctuations have been
considered. Here we take into account the inhomogeneity of the radio background created by a population
of high-redshift galaxies, and show that it adds a new type of 21-cm fluctuations to the well-known
contributions of density, velocity, Ly-${\alpha}$ coupling, heating and reionization. We find
that a population of high-redshift galaxies even with a moderately-enhanced radio efficiency
(unrelated to the EDGES result) can have a significant effect on the 21-cm power spectrum and global
signal in models with weak X-ray heating. For models that can explain the EDGES data, we conduct a
large parameter survey to explore their signatures. We show that in such models the 21-cm power spectrum
at $z\sim 17$ is enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude compared to the CMB-only standard case,
and the shape and time evolution of the power spectrum is significantly modified by the radio fluctuations.
These fluctuations are within reach of upcoming radio interferometers. We also find that these
models can be significantly constrained by current and future observations of radio sources.
