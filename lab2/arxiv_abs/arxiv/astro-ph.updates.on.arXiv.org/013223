We investigate the ionised gas kinematics, physical properties and chemical abundances of $J142947$,
a Green Pea galaxy at $z\sim 0.17$ with strong, double-peak Ly$\alpha$ emission and indirect evidence
of Lyman continuum (LyC) escape. Using deep high-dispersion long-slit spectroscopy, we perform
a multi-component Gaussian analysis of optical emission-line profiles. Our model consistently
fits all relevant emission lines as a narrow component with intrinsic velocity dispersion $\sigma\sim
40\ kms^{-1}$, and two broader blue-shifted components with $\sigma\sim 90\ kms^{-1}$ and $\sim
250\ kms^{-1}$. Emission-line ratios are used to find electron densities and temperatures, excitation
and ionisation conditions, and direct O/H and N/O abundances for each component. A highly ionised
([OIII]/[OII] $\sim 10$), metal-poor, young and compact starburst dominates narrow emission,
showing evidence of hard radiation fields and elevated N/O. The blue-shifted broader components
are consistent with highly turbulent, possibly clumpy ionised gas at the base of a strong photoionised
outflow, which accounts for $\gtrsim$ 50% of the integrated emission-line fluxes. The outflow
is dense and metal-enriched compared to the HII regions, with expansion velocities larger than
those obtained from UV interstellar absorption lines and the escape velocity under standard assumptions.
Some of these metals may be able to escape, with mass- and metal-loading factors of the outflow in
line with those found in high-$z$ galaxies of similar $\Sigma_{SFR}$. Our findings depict a two-stage
starburst picture; hard radiation fields from the younger star clusters illuminate a turbulent
and clumpy ISM that has been eroded by SNe feedback. We propose that ionising LyC photons are able
to escape into the halo through low HI density channels or filaments in the ISM approaching density-bounded
conditions, traced by outflowing gas.
