(abridged) Our aim is to determine the radial abundance profile of SiO and HCN throughout the stellar
outflow of R Dor, an oxygen-rich AGB star with a low mass-loss rate. We have analysed molecular transitions
of CO, SiO, and HCN measured with the APEX telescope and all three instruments on the Herschel Space
Observatory, together with literature data. Photometric data and the infrared spectrum measured
by ISO-SWS were used to constrain the dust component of the outflow. Using both continuum and line
radiative transfer methods, a physical envelope model of both gas and dust was established. We have
performed an analysis of the SiO and HCN molecular transitions in order to calculate their abundances.
We have obtained an envelope model that describes the dust and the gas in the outflow, and determined
the abundance of SiO and HCN throughout the region of the outflow probed by our molecular data. For
SiO, we find that the initial abundance lies between $5.5 \times 10^{-5}$ and $6.0 \times 10^{-5}$
w.r.t. H$_2$. The abundance profile is constant up to $60\ \pm 10\ R_*$, after which it declines following
a Gaussian profile with an $e$-folding radius of $3.5 \pm 0.5 \times 10^{13}$ cm. For HCN, we find
an initial abundance of $5.0 \times 10^{-7}$ w.r.t. H$_2$. The Gaussian profile that describes
the decline starts at the stellar surface and has an $e$-folding radius $r_e$ of $1.85 \pm 0.05 \times
10^{15}$ cm. We cannot to unambiguously identify the mechanism by which SiO is destroyed at $60\
\pm 10\ R_*$. The initial abundances found are larger than previously determined (except for one
previous study on SiO), which might be due to the inclusion of higher-$J$ transitions. The difference
in abundance for SiO and HCN compared to high mass-loss rate Mira star IK Tau might be due to different
pulsation characteristics of the central star and/or a difference in dust condensation physics.
