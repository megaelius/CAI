Post-shock regions (PSR) of polar cataclysmic variables produce most of their luminosity and give
rise to high circular polarization in optical wavelengths and strong variability on the white dwarf
rotation period, which are distinctive features of these systems. To investigate the polar candidate
V348 Pav, we obtained a comprehensive observational set including photometric, polarimetric,
and spectroscopic data, which was used to constrain the post-shock properties of the system. The
object presents high circular polarization ($\sim30$ per cent) and high He II 4686A to H$~\beta$
line ratio, confirming it is a polar. From both radial velocities and light curves, we determined
an orbital period of 79.98~min, close to the orbital period minimum of CVs. The H$~\beta$ radial
velocity curve has a semi-amplitude of $141.4\pm1.5$ km s$^{-1}$. Doppler tomography showed that
most of the spectral line emission in this system is originated in the region of the companion star
facing the WD, possibly irradiated by the emission related to the PSR. We modelled the PSR using the
Cyclops code. The PSR density and temperature profiles, obtained by a proper solution of the hydro-thermodynamic
equations, were used in a 3D radiative transfer solution that takes into account the system geometry.
We could reproduce the V348 Pav \textit{B, V, R}, and \textit{I} photometric and polarimetric data
using a model with a WD magnetic field of $\sim28$ MG, a WD mass of $\sim0.85$~M$_{\odot}$ and a low
($\sim25^{\circ}$) orbital inclination. These values for the WD mass and orbital inclination
are consistent with the measured radial velocities.
