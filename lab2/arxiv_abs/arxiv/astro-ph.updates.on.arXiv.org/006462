Recent detections of high-energy $\gamma$-rays by \emph{Fermi} from behind-the-limb (BTL) solar
flares pose a puzzle on the particle acceleration/transport mechanisms in such events. Due to the
large separation between the flare site and the location of $\gamma$-ray emission, it is suggested
that the associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) play an important role in accelerating and subsequently
transporting particles back to the Sun to produce the observed $\gamma$-rays. We explore this scenario
by simulating the CME associated with a BTL flare that occurred on 2014 September 1 about 40$\arcdeg$
behind the east solar limb. The flare was well observed by {\it Fermi}, {\it RHESSI}, {\it SDO}, and
{\it STEREO}. \emph{Fermi}/LAT detected a substantial flux of $>$100 MeV $\gamma$-rays for more
than an hour with an emission centroid located near the east limb but about 300$\arcsec$ north of
the centroid of the \emph{RHESSI} HXR source. We utilize a data-driven global magnetohydrodynamics
model (AWSoM: Alfv\'{e}n-wave Solar Model) and initiate the CME by the Gibson-Low flux rope to track
the dynamic evolution of the global magnetic field during the event and investigate the magnetic
connectivity between the CME/CME-driven shock and the \emph{Fermi}/LAT emission region. Moreover,
we derive the time-varying shock parameters over the area that becomes magnetically connected
to \emph{Fermi} $\gamma$-ray emission region on the visible solar disk. Our simulations show that
the CME/CME-driven shock develops connections both to the flare region and the visible solar disk
during the eruption, indicating that the CME's interaction with the global solar corona is critical
for \emph{Fermi} BTL events and the associated long duration $\gamma$-ray emission.
