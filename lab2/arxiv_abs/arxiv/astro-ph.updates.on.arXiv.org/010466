Freely-propagating global waves in the solar atmosphere are commonly observed using Extreme UltraViolet
passbands (EUV or "EIT waves"), and less regularly in H-alpha (Moreton-Ramsey waves). Despite
decades of research, joint observations of EUV and Moreton-Ramsey waves remain rare, complicating
efforts to quantify the connection between these phenomena. We present observations of four homologous
global waves originating from the same active region between 28-30 March 2014 and observed using
both EUV and H-alpha data. Each global EUV wave was observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory, with
the associated Moreton-Ramsey waves identified using the Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG)
network. All of the global waves exhibit high initial velocity (e.g., 842-1388 km s$^{-1}$ in the
193A passband) and strong deceleration (e.g., -1437 - -782 m s$^{-2}$ in the 193A passband) in each
of the EUV passbands studied, with the EUV wave kinematics exceeding those of the Moreton-Ramsey
wave. The density compression ratio of each global wave was estimated using both differential emission
measure and intensity variation techniques, with both indicating that the observed waves were
weakly shocked with a fast magnetosonic Mach number slightly greater than one. This suggests that,
according to current models, the global coronal waves were not strong enough to produce Moreton-Ramsey
waves, indicating an alternative explanation for these observations. Instead, we conclude that
the evolution of the global waves was restricted by the surrounding coronal magnetic field, in each
case producing a downward-angled wavefront propagating towards the north solar pole which perturbed
the chromosphere and was observed as a Moreton-Ramsey wave.
