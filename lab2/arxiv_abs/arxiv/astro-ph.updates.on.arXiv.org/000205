While the possible roles of GRBs' progenitors as Gravitational Waves (GW) sources have been extensively
studied, little attention has been given to the GRB jet itself as a GW source. We expect the acceleration
of the jet to produce a Gravitational Wave Memory signal. While all relativistic jet models display
anti-beaming of GW radiation away from the jet axis, thus radiating away from directions of GRBs'
gamma radiation, this effect is not overwhelming. The decrease of the signal amplitude towards
the cone of gamma-ray detectability is weak, and for some models and parameters the GW signal reaches
a significant amplitude for much of the gamma-ray cone. Thus both signals may be jointly detected.
We find different waveforms and fourier signatures for uniform jets and structured jet models -
thus offering a method of using GW signatures to probe the internal structure and acceleration of
GRB jets. The GW signal peaks just outside the jet (core) of a uniform (structuted) jet. Within the
jet (core) the GW signal displays wiggles, due to a polarization effect; thus for a uniform jet, the
peak amplitude accompanies a smoother signal than the peak of a structured jet. For the most probable
detection angle and for typical GRB parameters, we expect frequencies < ~600Hz and amplitudes
h~10^-25. Our estimates of the expected signals suggest that the signals are not strong enough for
a single cluster of DECIGO nor for aLIGO's sensitivities. However, DECIGO's 2-clusters mode should
detect such signals from most detected GRBs, as well as from events whose GRB's are beamed away from
us (including orphan afterglows).
