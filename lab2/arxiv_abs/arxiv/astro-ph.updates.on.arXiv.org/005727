In this paper we review the operational definition of the so-called main sequence knee (MS-knee),
a feature in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) occurring at the low-mass end of the MS. The magnitude
of this feature is predicted to be independent of age at fixed chemical composition. For this reason,
its difference in magnitude with respect to the MS turn-off (MS-TO) point has been suggested as a
possible diagnostic to estimate absolute globular cluster (GC) ages. We first demonstrate that
the operational definition of the MS-knee currently adopted in the literature refers to the inflection
point of the MS (that we here more appropriately named MS-saddle), a feature that is well distinct
from the knee and that cannot be used as its proxy. The MS-knee is only visible in near-infrared CMDs,
while the MS-saddle can be also detected in optical-NIR CMDs. By using different sets of isochrones
we then demonstrate that the absolute magni- tude of the MS-knee varies by a few tenths of a dex from
one model to another, thus showing that at the moment stellar models may not capture the full systematic
error in the method. We also demonstrate that while the absolute magnitude of the MS-saddle is almost
coincident in different models, it has a systematic dependence on the adopted color combinations
which is not predicted by stellar models. Hence, it cannot be used as a reliable reference for absolute
age determination. Moreover, when statistical and systematic uncertainties are properly taken
into ac- count, the difference in magnitude between the MS-TO and the MS-saddle does not provide
absolute ages with better accuracy than other methods like the MS-fitting.
