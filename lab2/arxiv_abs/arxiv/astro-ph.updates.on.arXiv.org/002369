We investigate the use of type Ic Super Luminous Supernovae as standardizable candles and distance
indicators. Their appeal as cosmological probes stems from their remarkable peak luminosities,
hot blackbody temperatures and bright restframe ultraviolet emission. We present a sample of sixteen
published SLSN, from redshifts 0.1 to 1.2 and calculate accurate K-corrections to determine uniform
magnitudes in two synthetic rest-frame filters with central wavelengths at 400nm and 520nm. At
400nm, we find a low scatter in their uncorrected, raw mean magnitudes with M(400)=-21.86 for the
full sample of sixteen objects. We investigate the correlation between their decline rates and
peak magnitude and find that the brighter events appear to decline more slowly. We define a $\Delta
M(20)$ decay relation. This correlates peak magnitude and decline over 20 days and can reduce the
scatter to 0.22. We further show that M(400) appears to have a strong colour dependence. Using this
colour rate decay relation, a low scatter of between 0.08 and 0.13 can be found depending on sample
selection. However we caution that only eight to ten objects currently have enough data to test this
colour rate decline relation. We conclude that SLSN Ic are promising distance indicators at high
redshift in regimes beyond those possible with SNe Ia. Although the empirical relationships are
encouraging, the unknown progenitor systems and how they may evolve with redshift are of some concern.
The two major measurement uncertainties are the limited numbers of low redshift objects to test
these relationships and internal dust extinction in the host galaxies.
