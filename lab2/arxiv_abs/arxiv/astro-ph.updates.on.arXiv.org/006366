We present Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope 610 MHz observations of 14 Atacama Cosmology Telescope
(ACT) equatorial clusters, including new data for nine. The sample includes 11 of 15 ACT equatorial
clusters (i.e., 73\%) with $M_{500} > 5 \times 10^{14}\;M_\odot$, and in three of 11 (27$^{+20}_{-14}$\%)
we detect diffuse emission. We detect a $S_{610} = 2.1\;\pm\;0.2$ mJy radio mini-halo in ACT-CL
J0022.2$-$0036 at $z=0.8$, making it the highest-redshift mini-halo known. We detect potential
radio relic emission in ACT-CL J0014.9$-$0057 ($z=0.533$), and confirm the presence of a radio
halo in the low-mass cluster ACT-CL J0256.5+0006, with flux $S_{610} = 6.3\;\pm\;0.4$ mJy. We also
detect residual diffuse emission in ACT-CL J0045.9$-$0152 ($z=0.545$), which we cannot conclusively
classify. For systems lacking diffuse radio emission, we determine radio halo upper limits in two
ways and find via survival analysis that these limits do not significantly affect radio power scaling
relations. Several clusters with no diffuse emission detection are known or suspected mergers,
based on archival X-ray and/or optical measures; given the limited sensitivity of our observations
(median central map noise 44 $\mu$Jy/beam), deeper observations are required to determine if diffuse
radio emission is present in these disturbed systems. In parallel with our diffuse emission results,
we present catalogs of individual radio sources, including a few interesting extended sources.
Our study represents the first probe of the occurrence of diffuse emission in high-redshift ($z
\gtrsim 0.5$) clusters, and serves as a pilot for statistical studies of larger cluster samples
with the new radio telescopes available in the pre-SKA era.
