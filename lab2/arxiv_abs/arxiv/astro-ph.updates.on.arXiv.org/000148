Aims: To investigate a possible dependence between age and metallicity in the Magellanic Clouds
(MCs) from a study of small open star clusters, using Str\"{o}mgren photometry. Our goal is to trace
evidence of an age metallicity relation (AMR) and correlate it with the mutual interactions of the
two MCs. Our aim is also to correlate the AMR with the spatial distribution of the clusters. In the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the majority of the selected clusters are young (up to 1 Gyr) and our
aim is to search for an AMR at this epoch which has not been much studied. Methods: We report on results
for 15 LMC and 8 Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) clusters, scattered all over the area of these galaxies,
to cover a wide spatial distribution and metallicity range. The selected LMC clusters were observed
with the 1.54m Danish Telescope in Chile, using the Danish Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera
(DFOSC) with a single 2kx2k CCD, whereas the SMC clusters were observed with the ESO 3.6m Telescope
also in Chile with the ESO Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (EFOSC). The obtained frames were
analysed with the conventional DAOPHOT and IRAF software. We used Str\"{o}mgren filters in order
to achieve reliable metallicities from photometry. Isochrone fitting was used in order to determine
the ages and metallicities. Results: The AMR for the LMC displays a metallicity gradient, with higher
metallicities for the younger ages. The AMR for LMC-SMC star clusters shows a possible jump in metallicity
and a considerable increase at about 6x10^8 yr. It is possible that this is connected to the latest
LMC-SMC interaction. The AMR for the LMC also displays a metallicity gradient with distance from
the centre. The metallicities in SMC are lower, as expected for a metal poor host galaxy.
