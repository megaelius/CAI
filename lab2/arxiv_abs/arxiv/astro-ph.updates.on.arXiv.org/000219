We present yields from stars of mass in the range Mo<M<8Mo of metallicities Z=0.0003 and Z=0.008,
thus encompassing the chemistry of low- and high-Z Globular Clusters. The yields are based on full
evolutionary computations, following the evolution of the stars from the pre-Main Sequence through
the Asymptotic Giant Branch phase, until the external envelope is lost. Independently of metallicity,
stars with M<3Mo are dominated by Third Dredge-Up, thus ejecting into their surroundings gas
enriched in carbon and nitrogen. Conversely, Hot Bottom Burning is the main responsible for the
modification of the surface chemistry of more massive stars, whose mass exceeds 3Mo: their gas shows
traces of proton-capture nucleosynthesis. The extent of Hot Bottom Burning turns out to be strongly
dependent on metallicity. In this paper we analyze the consequences of this fact. These results
can be used to understand the role played by intermediate mass stars in the self-enrichment scenario
of globular clusters: the results from spectroscopic investigations of stars belonging to the
second generation of clusters with different metallicity will be used as an indirect test of the
reliability of the present yields. The treatment of mass loss and convection are confirmed as the
main uncertainties affecting the results obtained in the context of the modeling of the thermal
pulses phase. An indirect proof of this comes from the comparison with other investigations in the
literature, based on a different prescription for the efficiency of convection in transporting
energy and using a different recipe to determine the mass loss rate.
