Collisions between large, similar-sized bodies are believed to shape the final characteristics
and composition of terrestrial planets. Their inventories of volatiles such as water, are either
delivered or at least significantly modified by such events. Besides the transition from accretion
to erosion with increasing impact velocity, similar-sized collisions can also result in hit-and-run
outcomes for sufficiently oblique impact angles and large enough projectile-to-target mass ratios.
We study volatile transfer and loss focusing on hit-and-run encounters by means of Smooth Particle
Hydrodynamics simulations, including all main parameters: impact velocity, impact angle, mass
ratio, and also the total colliding mass. We find a broad range of overall water losses, up to 75% in
the most energetic hit-and-run events, and confirm the much more severe consequences for the smaller
body also for stripping of volatile layers. Transfer of water between projectile and target inventories
is found to be mostly rather inefficient, and final water contents are dominated by pre-collision
inventories reduced by impact losses, for similar pre-collision water mass fractions. Comparison
with our numerical results shows that current collision outcome models are not accurate enough
to reliably predict these composition changes in hit-and-run events. To also account for non-mechanical
losses we estimate the amount of collisionally vaporized water over a broad range of masses, and
find that these contributions are particularly important in collisions of ~Mars-sized bodies,
with sufficiently high impact energies, but still relatively low gravity. Our results clearly
indicate that the cumulative effect of several (hit-and-run) collisions can efficiently strip
protoplanets of their volatile layers, especially the smaller body, as it might be common e.g. for
Earth-mass planets in systems with Super-Earths.
