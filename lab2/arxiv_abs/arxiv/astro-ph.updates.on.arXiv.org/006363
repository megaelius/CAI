We investigate the evolution of a well-observed, long-lived, low-latitude coronal hole (CH) over
10 solar rotations in the year 2012. By combining EUV imagery from STEREO-A/B and SDO we are able to
track and study the entire evolution of the CH having a continuous 360$\deg$ coverage of the Sun.
The remote sensing data are investigated together with in-situ solar wind plasma and magnetic field
measurements from STEREO-A/B, ACE and WIND. From this we obtain how different evolutionary states
of the CH as observed in the solar atmosphere (changes in EUV intensity and area) affect the properties
of the associated high-speed stream measured at $1$AU. Most distinctly pronounced for the CH area,
three development phases are derived: a) growing, b) maximum, and c) decaying phase. During these
phases the CH area a) increases over a duration of around three months from about $1 \cdot 10^{10}
\mathrm{km}^{2}$ to $6 \cdot 10^{10} \mathrm{km}^{2}$, b) keeps a rather constant area for about
one month of $> 9 \cdot 10^{10} \mathrm{km}^{2}$, and c) finally decreases in the following three
months below $1 \cdot 10^{10} \mathrm{km}^{2}$ until the CH cannot be identified anymore. The three
phases manifest themselves also in the EUV intensity and in in-situ measured solar wind proton bulk
velocity. Interestingly, the three phases are related to a different range in solar wind speed variations
and we find for the growing phase a range of $460-600$~km~s$^{-1}$, for the maximum phase $600-720$~km~s$^{-1}$,
and for the decaying phase a more irregular behavior connected to slow and fast solar wind speed of
$350-550$~km~s$^{-1}$.
