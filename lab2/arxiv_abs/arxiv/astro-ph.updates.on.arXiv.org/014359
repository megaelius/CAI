The nucleus of the planetary nebula Hen2-428 is a short orbital-period (4.2h), double-lined spectroscopic
binary, whose status as a potential supernova type Ia progenitor has raised some controversy in
the literature. With the aim of resolving this debate, we carried out an in-depth reanalysis of the
system. Our approach combines a refined wavelength calibration, thorough line-identifications,
improved radial-velocity measurements, non-LTE spectral modeling, as well as multi-band light-curve
fitting. Our results are then discussed in view of state-of-the-art stellar evolutionary models.
Besides systematic zero-point shifts in the wavelength calibration of the OSIRIS spectra which
were also used in the previous analysis of the system, we found that the spectra are contaminated
with diffuse interstellar bands. Our Voigt-profile radial velocity fitting method, which considers
the additional absorption of these diffuse interstellar bands, reveals significantly lower masses
($M_1=0.66\pm0.11M_\odot$ and $M_2=0.42\pm0.07M_\odot$) than previously reported and a mass
ratio that is clearly below unity. Our spectral and light curve analyses lead to consistent results,
however, we find higher effective temperatures and smaller radii than previously reported. Moreover,
we find that the red-excess that was reported before to prove to be a mere artifact of an outdated reddening
law that was applied. Our work shows that blends of HeII 5412A with diffuse interstellar bands have
led to an overestimation of the previously reported dynamical masses of Hen2-428. The merging event
of Hen2-428 will not be recognised as a supernova type Ia, but most likely leads to the formation of
a H-deficient star. We suggest that the system was formed via a first stable mass transfer episode,
followed by common envelope evolution, and it is now composed of a post-early AGB star and a reheated
He-core white dwarf.
