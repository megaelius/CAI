AX J0049.4-7323 is a Be/X-ray binary that shows an unusual and poorly understood optical variability
that consists of periodic and bright optical outbursts, simultaneous with X-ray outbursts, characterised
by a highly asymmetric profile. The periodicity of the outbursts is thought to correspond to the
orbital period of the neutron star. To understand the behaviour shown by this source, we performed
the first multi-wavelength monitoring campaign during the periastron passage of December 2017.
The monitoring lasted for ~37 days and consisted of X-ray, near-ultraviolet, and optical data from
the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, the optical I band from the OGLE survey, and spectroscopic observations
of the H-alpha line performed with the 3.9 m Anglo-Australian Telescope. These observations revealed
AX J0049.4-7323 during an anomalous outburst having remarkably different properties compared
to the previous ones. In the I band, it showed a longer rise timescale (~60 days instead of 1-5 days)
and a longer decay timescale. At the peak of the outburst, it showed a sudden increase in luminosity
in the I band, corresponding to the onset of the X-ray outburst. The monitoring of the H-alpha emission
line showed a fast and highly variable profile composed of three peaks with variable reciprocal
brightness. We interpreted these results as a circumstellar disc warped by tidal interactions
with the neutron star in a high eccentricity orbit during its periastron passage. The fast jump in
optical luminosity at the peak of the outburst and the previous asymmetric outbursts might be caused
by the reprocessing of the X-ray photons in the circumstellar disc or the tidal displacement of a
large amount of material from the circumstellar disc or the outer layers of the donor star during
the periastron passage of the neutron star, which led to an increase in size of the region emitting
in the I band.
