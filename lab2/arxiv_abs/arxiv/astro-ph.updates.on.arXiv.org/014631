Rapid variability before and near the maximum brightness of supernovae has the potential to provide
a better understanding of nearly every aspect of supernovae, from the physics of the explosion up
to their progenitors and the circumstellar environment. Thanks to modern time-domain optical
surveys, which are discovering supernovae in the early stage of their evolution, we have the unique
opportunity to capture their intraday behavior before maximum. We present high-cadence photometric
monitoring (on the order of seconds-minutes) of the optical light curves of three Type Ia and two
Type II SNe over several nights before and near maximum light, using the fast imagers available on
the 2.3~m Aristarchos telescope at Helmos Observatory and the 1.2~m telescope at Kryoneri Observatory
in Greece. We applied differential aperture photometry techniques using optimal apertures and
we present reconstructed light curves after implementing a seeing correction and the Trend Filtering
Algorithm(TFA). TFA yielded the best results, achieving a typical precision between 0.01-0.04~mag.
We did not detect significant bumps with amplitudes greater than 0.05~mag in any of the SNe targets
in the VR-, R-, and I- bands light curves obtained. We measured the intraday slope for each light curve,
which ranges between -0.37-0.36 mag/day in broadband VR, -0.19-0.31 mag/day in R band, and -0.13-0.10
mag/day in I band. We used SNe light curve fitting templates for SN 2018gv, SN 2018hgc and SN 2018hhn
to photometrically classify the light curves and to calculate the time of maximum. We provide values
for the maximum of SN 2018zd after applying a low-order polynomial fit and SN 2018hhn for the first
time. We suggest monitoring early supernovae light curves in hotter (bluer) bands with a cadence
of hours as a promising way of investigating the post-explosion photometric behavior of the progenitor
stars.
