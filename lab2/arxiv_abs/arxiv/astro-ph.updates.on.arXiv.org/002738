To fully understand the Be star phenomenon, one must have a reasonable degree of knowledge about
the star beneath the disk, which is often found to be rapidly rotating. Rapid rotation complicates
modelling because fundamental properties like the stellar luminosity and effective temperature
require knowledge of the angle of inclina- tion at which the star is observed. Furthermore our knowledge
of the structure of rapidly rotating stars is on a less sure foundation than for non-rotating stars.
The uncertainties in the inclination and the surface properties of a few rapidly rotating stars
have been substantially reduced by interferometric observations over the last decade, and these
stars can be used as tests of rotating stellar models, even if those stars themselves may not be Be
stars. Vega, as an MK standard, is historically a very important star because it is used for calibration
purposes. However, several studies have suggested that Vega is a rapidly rotating star viewed at
a very low inclination angle, raising questions as to how well we really know its properties. Appropriate
modelling has been challenging and there is still room for debate over the actual properties of Vega,
as opposed to its observed properties. We have previously shown that under certain conditions both
the stellar surface properties and the deduced surface properties scale from one model to another
with the same surface shape. We used this scaling algorithm with realistic 2D models to compute high-resolution
spectral energy distributions and interferometric visibilities to determine the best rotating
model fit to Vega. Detailed comparisons between the computed and observed data will be presented.
