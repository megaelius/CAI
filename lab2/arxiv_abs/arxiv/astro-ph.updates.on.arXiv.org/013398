We report on radial velocity time series for two M0.0V stars, GJ338B and GJ338A, using the CARMENES
spectrograph, complemented by ground-telescope photometry from Las Cumbres and Sierra Nevada
observatories. We aim to explore the presence of small planets in tight orbits using the spectroscopic
radial velocity technique. We obtained 159 and 70 radial velocity measurements of GJ338B and A,
respectively, with the CARMENES visible channel. We also compiled additional relative radial
velocity measurements from the literature and a collection of astrometric data that cover 200 a
of observations to solve for the binary orbit. We found dynamical masses of 0.64$\pm$0.07M$_\odot$
for GJ338B and 0.69$\pm$0.07M$_\odot$ for GJ338A. The CARMENES radial velocity periodograms
show significant peaks at 16.61$\pm$0.04 d (GJ338B) and 16.3$^{+3.5}_{-1.3}$ d (GJ338A), which
have counterparts at the same frequencies in CARMENES activity indicators and photometric light
curves. We attribute these to stellar rotation. GJ338B shows two additional, significant signals
at 8.27$\pm$0.01 and 24.45$\pm$0.02 d, with no obvious counterparts in the stellar activity indices.
The former is likely the first harmonic of the star's rotation, while we ascribe the latter to the
existence of a super-Earth planet with a minimum mass of 10.27$^{+1.47}_{-1.38}$$M_{\oplus}$
orbiting GJ338B. GJ338B b lies inside the inner boundary of the habitable zone around its parent
star. It is one of the least massive planets ever found around any member of stellar binaries. The
masses, spectral types, brightnesses, and even the rotational periods are very similar for both
stars, which are likely coeval and formed from the same molecular cloud, yet they differ in the architecture
of their planetary systems.
