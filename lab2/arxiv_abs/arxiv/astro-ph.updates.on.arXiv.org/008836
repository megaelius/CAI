The characteristic two-component blazar spectral energy distribution (SED) can be of either leptonic
and/or hadronic origins. The potential association of the high-energy neutrino event IceCube-170922A
with the flaring blazar TXS~0506+056 indicates that hadronic processes may operate in a blazar
jet. Despite multi-wavelength follow-ups of the event and extensive theoretical modelings, the
radiation mechanisms and the underlying magnetic field strength and configuration remain poorly
understood. In this paper, we consider generic leptonic and hadronic blazar spectral models with
distinct magnetic field strengths and radiation mechanisms. We analytically reproduce the SEDs
and the neutrino flux of hadronic models, and predict their X-ray to $\gamma$-ray polarization
degrees. Furthermore, by performing relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations taking
into account the polarization-dependent radiation transfer, we study the time-dependent multi-wavelength
polarization variability of the proton synchrotron model under a shock scenario. Our results suggest
that the high-energy polarization degree and the neutrino flux can be jointly used to pinpoint the
leptonic and/or hadronic blazar radiation mechanisms in the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray bands, and
to infer the magnetic field strength in the emission region. Additionally, the temporal multi-wavelength
polarization signatures in the proton synchrotron model shed light on the jet energy composition
and the dynamical importance of magnetic fields in the blazar emission region. Future multi-wavelength
polarimetry facilities such as {\it IXPE} and {\it AMEGO} together with neutrino telescopes such
as {\it IceCube} can provide unprecedented observational constraints to probe the blazar radiation
mechanisms and jet dynamics.
