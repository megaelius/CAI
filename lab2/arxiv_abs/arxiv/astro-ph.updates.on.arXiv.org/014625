The interiors of giant planets remain poorly understood. Even for the planets in the Solar System,
difficulties in observation lead to large uncertainties in the properties of planetary cores.
Exoplanets that have undergone rare evolutionary processes provide a route to understanding planetary
interiors. Planets found in and near the typically barren hot-Neptune 'desert' (a region in mass-radius
space that contains few planets) have proved to be particularly valuable in this regard. These planets
include HD149026b, which is thought to have an unusually massive core, and recent discoveries such
as LTT9779b and NGTS-4b, on which photoevaporation has removed a substantial part of their outer
atmospheres. Here we report observations of the planet TOI-849b, which has a radius smaller than
Neptune's but an anomalously large mass of $39.1^{+2.7}_{-2.6}$ Earth masses and a density of $5.2^{+0.7}_{-0.8}$
grams per cubic centimetre, similar to Earth's. Interior structure models suggest that any gaseous
envelope of pure hydrogen and helium consists of no more than $3.9^{+0.8}_{-0.9}$ per cent of the
total planetary mass. The planet could have been a gas giant before undergoing extreme mass loss
via thermal self-disruption or giant planet collisions, or it could have avoided substantial gas
accretion, perhaps through gap opening or late formation. Although photoevaporation rates cannot
account for the mass loss required to reduce a Jupiter-like gas giant, they can remove a small (a few
Earth masses) hydrogen and helium envelope on timescales of several billion years, implying that
any remaining atmosphere on TOI-849b is likely to be enriched by water or other volatiles from the
planetary interior. We conclude that TOI-849b is the remnant core of a giant planet.
