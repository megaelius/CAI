We present a recent Chandra observation of the quiescent low-mass X-ray binary containing a neutron
star, located in the globular cluster M30. We fit the thermal emission from the neutron star to extract
its mass and radius. We find no evidence of flux variability between the two observations taken in
2001 and 2017, nor between individual 2017 observations, so we analyse them together to increase
the signal to noise. We perform simultaneous spectral fits using standard light-element composition
atmosphere models (hydrogen or helium), including absorption by the interstellar medium, correction
for pile-up of X-ray photons on the detector, and a power-law for count excesses at high photon energy.
Using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo approach, we extract mass and radius credible intervals for both
chemical compositions of the atmosphere: $R_{\textrm{NS}}=7.94^{+0.76}_{-1.21}$ km and $M_{\textrm{NS}}<1.19$
M$_{\odot}$ assuming pure hydrogen, and $R_{\textrm{NS}}=10.50^{+2.88}_{-2.03}$ km and $M_{\textrm{NS}}<1.78$
M$_{\odot}$ for helium, where the uncertainties represent the 90% credible regions. For H, the
small radius is difficult to reconcile with most current nuclear physics models (especially for
nucleonic equations of state) and with other measurements of neutron star radii, with recent preferred
values generally in the 11-14 km range. Whereas for He, the measured radius is consistent with this
range. We discuss possible sources of systematic uncertainty that may result in an underestimation
of the radius, identifying the presence of surface temperature inhomogeneities as the most relevant
bias. According to this, we conclude that either the atmosphere is composed of He, or it is a H atmosphere
with a significant contribution of hot spots to the observed radiation.
