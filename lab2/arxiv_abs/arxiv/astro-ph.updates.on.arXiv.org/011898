The global Schmidt law of star formation provides a power-law relation between the surface densities
of star-formation rate (SFR) and gas, and successfully explains plausible scenarios of galaxy
formation and evolution. However, star formation being a multi-scale process, requires spatially-resolved
analysis for a better understanding of the physics of star formation. It has been shown that the removal
of a diffuse background from SFR tracers, such as H$\alpha$, far-ultraviolet (FUV), infrared,
leads to an increase in the slope of the sub-galactic Schmidt relation. We reinvestigate the local
Schmidt relations in nine nearby spiral galaxies taking into account the effect of inclusion and
removal of diffuse background in SFR tracers as well as in the atomic gas.We used multiwavelength
data obtained as part of the surveys such as SINGS, KINGFISH, THINGS, and HERACLES. Making use of
a novel split of the overall light distribution as a function of spatial scale, we subtracted the
diffuse background in the SFR tracers as well as the atomic gas. Using aperture photometry, we study
the Schmidt relations on background subtracted and unsubtracted data at physical scales varying
between 0.5--2 kpc. The fraction of diffuse background varies from galaxy to galaxy and accounts
to $\sim$34 % in H$\alpha$, $\sim$43 % in FUV, $\sim$37 % in 24 $\mu$m, and $\sim$75\% in H I on average.
We find that the inclusion of diffuse background in SFR tracers leads to a linear molecular gas Schmidt
relation and a bimodal total gas Schmidt relation. However, the removal of diffuse background in
SFR tracers leads to a super-linear molecular gas Schmidt relation. A further removal of the diffuse
background from atomic gas results in a slope $\sim$1.4 $\pm$ 0.1, which agrees with dynamical models
of star formation accounting for flaring effects in the outer regions of galaxies.
