The surface composition of S-type asteroids can be determined using band parameters extracted
from their near-infrared (NIR) spectra (0.7-2.50 $\mu$m) along with spectral calibrations derived
from laboratory samples. In the past, these empirical equations have been obtained by combining
NIR spectra of meteorite samples with information about their composition and mineral abundance.
For these equations to give accurate results, the characteristics of the laboratory spectra they
are derived from should be similar to those of asteroid spectral data (i.e., similar signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N) and wavelength range). Here we present new spectral calibrations that can be used to
determine the mineral composition of ordinary chondrite-like S-type asteroids. Contrary to previous
work, the S/N of the ordinary chondrite spectra used in this study has been decreased to recreate
the S/N typically observed among asteroid spectra, allowing us to obtain more realistic results.
In addition, the new equations have been derived for five wavelength ranges encompassed between
0.7 and 2.50 $\mu$m, making it possible to determine the composition of asteroids with incomplete
data. The new spectral calibrations were tested using band parameters measured from the NIR spectrum
of asteroid (25143) Itokawa, and comparing the results with laboratory measurements of the returned
samples. We found that the spectrally derived olivine and pyroxene chemistry, which are given by
the molar contents of fayalite (Fa) and ferrosilite (Fs), are in excellent agreement with the mean
values measured from the samples (Fa$_{28.6\pm1.1}$ and Fs$_{23.1\pm2.2}$), with a maximum difference
of 0.6 mol\% for Fa and 1.4 mol\% for Fs.
