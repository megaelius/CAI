Convection is an important physical process in astrophysics well-studied using numerical simulations
under the Boussinesq and/or anelastic approximations. However these approaches reach their limits
when compressible effects are important in the high Mach flow regime, e.g. in stellar atmospheres
or in the presence of accretion shocks. In order to tackle these issues, we propose a new high performance
and portable code, called "ARK" with a numerical solver well-suited for the stratified compressible
Navier-Stokes equations. We take a finite volume approach with machine precision conservation
of mass, transverse momentum and total energy. Based on previous works in applied mathematics we
propose the use of a low Mach correction to achieve a good precision in both low and high Mach regimes.
The gravity source term is discretized using a well-balanced scheme in order to reach machine precision
hydrostatic balance. This new solver is implemented using the Kokkos library in order to achieve
high performance computing and portability across different architectures (e.g. multi-core,
many-core, and GP-GPU). We show that the low-Mach correction allows to reach the low-Mach regime
with a much better accuracy than a standard Godunov-type approach. The combined well-balanced
property and the low-Mach correction allowed us to trigger Rayleigh-B\'enard convective modes
close to the critical Rayleigh number. Furthermore we present 3D turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard
convection with low diffusion using the low-Mach correction leading to a higher kinetic energy
power spectrum. These results are very promising for future studies of high Mach and highly stratified
convective problems in astrophysics.
