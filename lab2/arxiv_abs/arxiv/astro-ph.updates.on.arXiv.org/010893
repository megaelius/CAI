We present the measurements and modelling of the small-to-intermediate scale (0.1--25 Mpc/h)
projected and three-dimensional (3D) redshift-space two-point correlation functions (2PCFs)
of local galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7. We find a clear dependence
of galaxy clustering on luminosity in both projected and redshift spaces, generally being stronger
for more luminous samples. The measurements are successfully interpreted within the halo occupation
distribution (HOD) framework with central and satellite velocity bias parameters to describe
galaxy kinematics inside haloes and to model redshift-space distortion (RSD) effects. In agreement
with previous studies, we find that more luminous galaxies reside in more massive haloes. Including
the redshift-space 2PCFs helps tighten the HOD constraints. Moreover, we find that luminous central
galaxies are not at rest at the halo centres, with the velocity dispersion about 30% that of the dark
matter. Such a relative motion may reflect the consequence of galaxy and halo mergers, and we find
that central galaxies in lower mass haloes tend to be more relaxed with respect to their host haloes.
The motion of satellite galaxies in luminous samples is consistent with their following that of
the dark matter. For faint samples, satellites tends to have slower motion, with velocity dispersion
inside haloes about 85% that of the dark matter. We discuss possible applications of the velocity
bias constraints on studying galaxy evolution and cosmology. In the appendix, we characterize
the distribution of galaxy redshift measurement errors, which is well described by a Gaussian-convolved
double exponential distribution.
