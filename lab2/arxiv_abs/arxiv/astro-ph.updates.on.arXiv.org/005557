We describe the 44 systems discovered to be within 10 parsecs of the Sun by the RECONS team, primarily
via the long-term astrometry program at CTIO that began in 1999. The systems --- including 41 with
red dwarf primaries, 2 white dwarfs, and 1 brown dwarf --- have been found to have trigonometric parallaxes
greater than 100 milliarcseconds (mas), with errors of 0.4--2.4 mas in all but one case. We provide
updated astrometric, photometric (VRIJHK magnitudes), spectral type, and multiplicity information
here. Among these are 14 systems that are new entries to the 10 parsec sample based on parallaxes measured
at the CTIO/SMARTS 0.9m telescope. These are the first parallaxes for nine systems, while the remaining
five systems had previously measured parallaxes with errors greater than 10 mas or values placing
them beyond 10 parsecs. We also present parallaxes from URAT for seven of these systems, providing
additional evidence that they are closer than 10 parsecs. In addition, we provide new data for 22
systems that were previously known to lie within 10 parsecs and 9 systems reported to be closer than
that horizon but for which new parallaxes place them further away. In total, we provide data for 75
systems, for which 71 have new or updated parallaxes here. The 44 systems added by RECONS comprise
one of every seven systems known within 10 parsecs. We illustrate the evolution of the 10 parsec sample
from the 191 systems known when the final Yale Parallax Catalog (YPC) was published in 1995 to the
316 systems known today. Even so close to the Sun, additional discoveries of red and brown dwarfs
(and perhaps even white dwarfs) are likely, both as primaries and secondaries, although we estimate
that at least 90% of the stellar systems closer than 10 parsecs have now been identified.
