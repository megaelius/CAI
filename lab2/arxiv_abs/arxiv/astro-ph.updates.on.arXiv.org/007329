The spatial structure of the emission lines and continuum over the 50 arcsecond extent of the nearby,
O-rich, planetary nebula NGC 7009 (Saturn Nebula) have been observed with the MUSE integral field
spectrograph on the ESO Very Large Telescope. Science Verification data, in <0.6 arcsecond seeing,
have been reduced and analysed as images over the wavelength range 4750-9350A. Emission line maps
over the bright shells are presented, from neutral to the highest ionization available (He II and
[Mn V]). For collisionally excited lines (CELs), maps of electron temperature (T_e from [N II] and
[S III]) and electron density (N_e from [S II] and [Cl III]) are available and for optical recombination
lines (ORLs) temperature (from the Paschen jump and ratio of He I lines) and density (from high Paschen
lines). These estimates are compared: for the first time, maps of the differences in CEL and ORL T_e's
have been derived, and correspondingly a map of t^2 between a CEL and ORL temperature, showing considerable
detail. Total abundances of He and O were formed, the latter using three ionization correction factors.
However the map of He/H is not flat, departing by ~2% from a constant value, with remnants corresponding
to ionization structures. Ionization correction factor methods are compared for O abundance,
but none delivers a flat map. An integrated spectrum over an area of 2340 square arcseconds was also
formed and compared to 1D photoionization models. The spatial variation of a range of nebular parameters
illustrates the complexity of the ionized media in NGC 7009. These MUSE data are very rich with detections
of many lines over areas of hundreds of square arcseconds and follow-on studies are indicated. (Abridged)
