In the outer solar system, the Kuiper Belt contains dynamical sub-populations sculpted by a combination
of planet formation and migration and gravitational perturbations from the present-day giant
planet configuration. The subdivision of observed Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) into different dynamical
classes is based on their current orbital evolution in numerical integrations of their orbits.
Here we demonstrate that machine learning algorithms are a promising tool for reducing both the
computational time and human effort required for this classification. Using a Gradient Boosting
Classifier, a type of machine learning regression tree classifier trained on features derived
from short numerical simulations, we sort observed KBOs into four broad, dynamically distinct
populations - classical, resonant, detached, and scattering - with a >97 per cent accuracy for the
testing set of 542 securely classified KBOs. Over 80 per cent of these objects have a $>3\sigma$ probability
of class membership, indicating that the machine learning method is classifying based on the fundamental
dynamical features of each population. We also demonstrate how, by using computational savings
over traditional methods, we can quickly derive a distribution of class membership by examining
an ensemble of object clones drawn from the observational errors. We find two major reasons for misclassification:
inherent ambiguity in the orbit of the object - for instance, an object that is on the edge of resonance
- and a lack of representative examples in the training set. This work provides a promising avenue
to explore for fast and accurate classification of the thousands of new KBOs expected to be found
by surveys in the coming decade.
