Instabilities in compact planetary systems are generically driven by chaotic dynamics. This implies
that an instability time measured through direct N-body integration is not exact, but rather represents
a single draw from a distribution of equally valid chaotic trajectories. In order to characterize
the "errors" on reported instability times from direct N-body integrations, we investigate the
shape and parameters of the instability time distributions (ITDs) for ensembles of shadow trajectories
that are initially perturbed from one another near machine precision. We find that in the limit where
instability times are long compared to the Lyapunov (chaotic) timescale, ITDs approach remarkably
similar lognormal distributions with standard deviations ~0.43 $\pm$ 0.16 dex, despite the instability
times varying across our sample from $10^4-10^8$ orbits. We find excellent agreement between these
predictions, derived from ~450 closely packed configurations of three planets, and a much wider
validation set of ~10,000 integrations, as well as on ~20,000 previously published integrations
of tightly packed five-planet systems, and a seven-planet resonant chain based on TRAPPIST-1,
despite their instability timescales extending beyond our analyzed timescale. We also test the
boundary of applicability of our results on dynamically excited versions of our Solar System. These
distributions define the fundamental limit imposed by chaos on the predictability of instability
times in such planetary systems. It provides a quantitative estimate of the intrinsic error on an
N-body instability time imprinted by chaos, approximately a factor of 3 in either direction.
