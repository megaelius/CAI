Bose-Einstein Condensate Dark Matter (BECDM; also known as Fuzzy Dark Matter) is motivated by fundamental
physics and has recently received significant attention as a serious alternative to the established
Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model. We perform cosmological simulations of BECDM gravitationally coupled
to baryons and investigate structure formation at high redshifts ($z \gtrsim 5$) for a boson mass
$m=2.5\cdot 10^{-22}~{\rm eV}$, exploring the dynamical effects of its wavelike nature on the
cosmic web and the formation of first galaxies. Our BECDM simulations are directly compared to CDM
as well as to simulations where the dynamical quantum potential is ignored and only the initial suppression
of the power spectrum is considered -- a Warm Dark Matter-like ("WDM") model often used as a proxy
for BECDM. Our simulations confirm that "WDM" is a good approximation to BECDM on large cosmological
scales even in the presence of the baryonic feedback. Similarities also exist on small scales, with
primordial star formation happening both in isolated haloes and continuously along cosmic filaments;
the latter effect is not present in CDM. Global star formation and metal enrichment in these first
galaxies are delayed in BECDM/"WDM" compared to the CDM case: in BECDM/"WDM" first stars form at
$z\sim 13$/$13.5$ while in CDM star formation starts at $z\sim 35$. The signature of BECDM interference,
not present in "WDM", is seen in the evolved dark matter power spectrum: although the small scale
structure is initially suppressed, power on kpc scales is added at lower redshifts. Our simulations
lay the groundwork for realistic simulations of galaxy formation in BECDM.
