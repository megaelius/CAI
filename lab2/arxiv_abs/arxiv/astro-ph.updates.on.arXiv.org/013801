The European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosetta mission has returned a vast data set of measurements of
the inner gas coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. These measurements have been used by different
groups to determine the distribution of the gas sources at the nucleus surface. The solutions that
have been found differ from each other substantially and illustrate the degeneracy of this issue.
It is the aim of this work to explore the limitations that current gas models have in linking the coma
measurements to the surface. In particular, we discuss the sensitivity of Rosetta's ROSINA/COPS,
VIRTIS, and MIRO instruments to differentiate between vastly different spatial distributions
of the gas emission from the surface. We have applied a state of the art 3D DSMC gas dynamics code to
simulate the inner gas coma of different models that vary in the fraction of the surface that contains
ice and in different sizes of active patches. These different distributions result in jet interactions
that differ in their dynamical behaviour. We have found that ROSINA/COPS measurements by themselves
cannot detect the differences in our models. While ROSINA/COPS measurements are important to constrain
the regional inhomogeneities of the gas emission, they can by themselves not determine the surface
emission distribution of the gas sources to a spatial accuracy of better than a few hundred metres
(400 m). Any solutions fitting the ROSINA/COPS measurements is hence fundamentally degenerate,
be it through a forward or inverse model. Only other instruments with complementary measurements
can potentially lift this degeneracy as we show here for VIRTIS and MIRO. Finally, as a by-product,
we have explored the effect of our activity distributions on lateral flow at the surface that may
be responsible for some of the observed aeolian features.
