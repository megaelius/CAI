We investigate a sample of 152 dusty sources at 1:5 < z < 2:5 to understand the connection of enhanced
Star-Formation-Rate (SFR) and Black-Hole-Accretion-Rate (BHAR). The sources are Herschel-selected,
having stellar masses M*>10^10Msun and SFR (100-1000Msun/yr) elevated(>4?) above the star-forming
"main sequence", classifying them as Starbursts (SB). Through a multiwavelength fitting approach
(including a dusty torus component), we divided the sample into active SBs (dominated by an AGN emission,
SBs-AGN, ? 23% of the sample) and purely star-forming SBs (SBs-SFR). We visually inspected their
HST/UV-restframe maps: SBs-SFR are generally irregular and composite systems; ? 50% of SBs-AGN
are instead dominated by regular compact morphologies. We then found archival ALMA continuum counterparts
for 33 galaxies (12 SBs-AGN and 21 SBs-SFR). For these sources we computed dust masses, and, with
standard assumptions, we also guessed total molecular gas-masses. SBs turn to be gas rich systems
(fgas = Mgas=Mgas/(Mgas+M*) \sim 20%-70%), and the gas fractions of the two SB classes are very similar
(fgas = 43 +/-4% and fgas = 42+/- 2%). Our results show that SBs are consistent with a mixture of: 1)
highly star-forming merging systems (dominating the SBs-SFR), and 2) primordial galaxies, rapidly
growing their M* together with their Black Hole (mainly the more compact SBs-AGN). Anyway, feedback
effects have not reduced their fgas yet. Indeed, SBs at z = 2, with relatively low bolometric AGN luminosities
in the range 10^44 < Lbol(AGN) < 10^46 erg/s (compared to bright optical and X-ray quasars), are still
relatively far from the epoch when the AGN feedback will quench the SFR in the host and will substantially
depress the gas fractions.
