We use Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope to investigate the structural and photometric
properties of early-type dwarf galaxies and young stellar systems at the center of the M81 Group.
We have mapped resolved stars to $\sim2$ magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch over almost
6.5 square degrees, corresponding to a projected area of $160\times160 \rm{kpc}$ at the distance
of M81. The resulting stellar catalogue enables a homogeneous analysis of the member galaxies with
unprecedented sensitivity to low surface brightness emission. The radial profiles of the dwarf
galaxies are well-described by Sersic and King profiles, and show no obvious signatures of tidal
disruption. The measured radii for most of these systems are larger than the existing literature
values and we find the total luminosity of IKN ($\rm{M_{V,0}}=-14.29$) to be almost 3 magnitudes
brighter than previously-thought. We identify new dwarf satellite candidates, d1006+69 and d1009+68,
which we estimate to lie at a distance of $4.3\pm0.2$ Mpc and $3.5\pm0.5$ Mpc. With $\rm{M_{V,0}}=-8.91\pm0.40$
and $\rm{[M/H]}=-1.83\pm0.28$, d1006+69 is one of the faintest and most metal-poor dwarf satellites
currently-known in the M81 Group. The luminosity functions of young stellar systems in the outlying
tidal HI debris imply continuous star formation in the recent past and the existence of populations
as young as 30 Myr old. We find no evidence for old RGB stars coincident with the young MS/cHeB stars
which define these objects, supporting the idea that they are genuinely new stellar systems resulting
from triggered star formation in gaseous tidal debris.
