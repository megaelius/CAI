The primordial power spectrum describes the initial perturbations in the Universe which eventually
grew into the large-scale structure we observe today, and thereby provides an indirect probe of
inflation or other structure-formation mechanisms. Here, we introduce a new method to estimate
this spectrum from the empirical power spectrum of cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps. A sparsity-based
linear inversion method, coined \textbf{PRISM}, is presented. This technique leverages a sparsity
prior on features in the primordial power spectrum in a wavelet basis to regularise the inverse problem.
This non-parametric approach does not assume a strong prior on the shape of the primordial power
spectrum, yet is able to correctly reconstruct its global shape as well as localised features. These
advantages make this method robust for detecting deviations from the currently favoured scale-invariant
spectrum. We investigate the strength of this method on a set of WMAP 9-year simulated data for three
types of primordial power spectra: a nearly scale-invariant spectrum, a spectrum with a small running
of the spectral index, and a spectrum with a localised feature. This technique proves to easily detect
deviations from a pure scale-invariant power spectrum and is suitable for distinguishing between
simple models of the inflation. We process the WMAP 9-year data and find no significant departure
from a nearly scale-invariant power spectrum with the spectral index $n_s = 0.972$. A high resolution
primordial power spectrum can be reconstructed with this technique, where any strong local deviations
or small global deviations from a pure scale-invariant spectrum can easily be detected.
