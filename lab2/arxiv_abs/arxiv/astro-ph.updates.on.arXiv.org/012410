As we are heading towards the next solar cycle, presumably with a relatively small amplitude, it
is of significant interest to reconstruct and describe the past grand minima on the basis of actual
observations of the time. The Dalton Minimum is often considered one of the grand minima captured
in the coverage of telescopic observations. Nevertheless, the reconstructions of the sunspot
group number vary significantly, and the existing butterfly diagrams have a large data gap during
the period. This is partially because most long-term observations have remained unexplored in
historical archives. Therefore, to improve our understanding on the Dalton Minimum, we have located
two series of Thadd\"aus Derfflinger's observational records (a summary manuscript and logbooks)
as well as his Brander's 5.5-feet azimuthal-quadrant preserved in the Kremsm\"unster Observatory.
We have revised the existing Derfflinger's sunspot group number with Waldmeier classification
and eliminated all the existing 'spotless days' to remove contaminations from solar meridian observations.
We have reconstructed the butterfly diagram on the basis of his observations and illustrated sunspot
distributions in both solar hemispheres. Our article aims to revise the trend of Derfflinger's
sunspot group number and to bridge a data gap of the existing butterfly diagrams around the Dalton
Minimum. Our results confirm that the Dalton Minimum is significantly different from the Maunder
Minimum, both in terms of cycle amplitudes and sunspot distributions. Therefore, the Dalton Minimum
is more likely a secular minimum in the long-term solar activity, while further investigations
for the observations at that time are required.
