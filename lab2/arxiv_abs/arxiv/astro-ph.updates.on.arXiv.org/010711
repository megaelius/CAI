All 10 O1/O2 LIGO/Virgo BH-BH mergers have near zero effective spins. There are only 3 potential
explanations. If the BH spin magnitudes are large then (i) either both BH spin vectors must be nearly
in the orbital plane or (ii) the spin angular momenta of the BHs must be oppositely directed and similar
in magnitude. Or, (iii) the BH spin magnitudes are small. We test the third hypothesis within the
framework of the classical isolated binary evolution scenario. We test 3 models of angular momentum
transport in massive stars: a mildly efficient transport by meridional currents (Geneva code),
an efficient transport by the Tayler-Spruit magnetic dynamo (MESA code), and a very-efficient
transport (Fuller et al.) to calculate natal BH spins. We allow for binary evolution to increase
the BH spins through accretion and account for the potential spin-up of stars through tidal interactions.
Additionally, we update the calculations of the stellar-origin BH masses, include revisions to
the history of star formation and to the chemical evolution across cosmic time. We find that we can
match simultaneously the observed BH-BH merger rate density, BH masses, and effective spins. Models
with efficient angular momentum transport are favored. The updated stellar-mass weighted gas-phase
metallicity evolution now used in our models appears to be a key in better reproducing the LIGO/Virgo
merger rate estimate. Mass losses during the pair-instability pulsation supernova phase are likely
overestimated if the merger GW170729 hosts a BH more massive than 50 Msun. We also estimate rate of
BH-NS mergers from recent LIGO/Virgo observations. Our updated models of BH-BH, BH-NS and NS-NS
mergers are now publicly available at www.syntheticuniverse.org under the tab "StarTrack models
vs. Gravitational Wave Observations".
