We report the discovery of 59 globular clusters (GCs) and two candidate GCs in a search of the halo
of M31, primarily via visual inspection of CHFT/MegaCam imagery from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological
Survey (PAndAS). The superior quality of these data also allow us to check the classification of
remote objects in the Revised Bologna Catalogue (RBC), plus a subset of GC candidates drawn from
SDSS imaging. We identify three additional new GCs from the RBC, and confirm the GC nature of 11 SDSS
objects (8 of which appear independently in our remote halo catalogue); the remaining 188 candidates
across both lists are either foreground stars or background galaxies. Our new catalogue represents
the first uniform census of GCs across the M31 halo - we find clusters to the limit of the PAndAS survey
area at projected radii of up to R_proj ~ 150 kpc. Tests using artificial clusters reveal that detection
incompleteness cuts in at luminosities below M_V = -6.0; our 50% completeness limit is M_V ~ -4.1.
We construct a uniform set of PAndAS photometric measurements for all known GCs outside R_proj =
25$ kpc, and any new GCs within this radius. With these data we update results from Huxor et al. (2011),
investigating the luminosity function (LF), colours and effective radii of M31 GCs with a particular
focus on the remote halo. We find that the GCLF is clearly bimodal in the outer halo (R_proj > 30
kpc), with the secondary peak at M_V ~ -5.5. We argue that the GCs in this peak have most likely been
accreted along with their host dwarf galaxies. Notwithstanding, we also find, as in previous surveys,
a substantial number of GCs with above-average luminosity in the outer M31 halo - a population with
no clear counterpart in the Milky Way.
