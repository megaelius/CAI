We present the first results from our survey of intervening and proximate Lyman limit systems (LLSs)
at $z$$\sim$2.0-2.5 using the Wide Field Camera 3 on-board the Hubble Space Telescope. The quasars
in our sample are projected pairs with proper transverse separations $R_\perp$$\leq$150 kpc and
line of sight velocity separations $\lesssim$11,000 km/s. We construct a stacked ultraviolet
(rest-frame wavelengths 700-2000\AA) spectrum of pairs corrected for the intervening Lyman forest
and Lyman continuum absorption. The observed spectral composite presents a moderate flux excess
for the most prominent broad emission lines, a $\sim$30% decrease in flux at $\lambda$=800-900\AA\
compared to a stack of brighter quasars not in pairs at similar redshifts, and lower values of the
mean free path of the HI ionizing radiation for pairs ($\lambda_{\rm mfp}^{912}=140.7\pm20.2~h_{70}^{-1}$Mpc)
compared to single quasars ($\lambda_{\rm mfp}^{912}=213.8\pm28~h_{70}^{-1}$Mpc) at the average
redshift $z\simeq2.44$. From the modelling of LLS absorption in these pairs, we find a higher ($\sim$20%)
incidence of proximate LLSs with $\log N_{\rm HI}\geq17.2$ at $\delta v$$<$5,000 km/s compared
to single quasars ($\sim$6%). These two rates are different at the 5$\sigma$ level. Moreover, we
find that optically-thick absorbers are equally shared between foreground and background quasars.
Based on these pieces of evidence, we conclude that there is a moderate excess of gas absorbing Lyman
continuum photons in our closely-projected quasar pairs compared to single quasars. We argue that
this gas arises mostly within large-scale structures or partially neutral regions inside the dark
matter haloes where these close pairs reside.
