We report the discovery of a new eclipsing polar, CRTS J035010.7+323230 (hereafter CRTS J0350+3232).
We identified this cataclysmic variable (CV) candidate as a possible polar from its multi-year
Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS) optical light curve. Photometric monitoring of 22
eclipses in 2015 and 2017 was performed with the 2.1-m Otto Struve Telescope at McDonald Observatory.
We derive an unambiguous high-precision ephemeris. Strong evidence that CRTS J0350+3232 is a polar
comes from optical spectroscopy obtained over a complete orbital cycle using the Apache Point Observatory
3.5-m telescope. High velocity Balmer and He II $\lambda$4686{\AA} emission line equivalent width
ratios, structures, and variations are typical of polars and are modulated at the same period, 2.37-hrs
(142.3-min), as the eclipse to within uncertainties. The spectral energy distribution and luminosity
is found to be comparable to that of AM Herculis. Pre-eclipse dips in the light curve show evidence
for stream accretion. We derive the following tentative binary and stellar parameters assuming
a helium composition white dwarf and a companion mass of 0.2 M$_{\odot}$: inclination i = 74.68$^{o}$
${\pm}$ 0.03$^{o}$, semi-major axis a = 0.942 ${\pm}$ 0.024 R$_{\odot}$, and masses and radii of
the white dwarf and companion respectively: M$_{1}$ = 0.948 $^{+0.006}_{-0.012}$ M$_{\odot}$,
R$_{1}$ = 0.00830 $^{+0.00012}_{-0.00006}$ R$_{\odot}$, R$_{2}$ = 0.249 ${\pm}$ 0.002 R$_{\odot}$.
As a relatively bright (V $\sim$ 17-19 mag), eclipsing, period-gap polar, CRTS J0350+3232 will
remain an important laboratory for the study of accretion and angular momentum evolution in polars.
