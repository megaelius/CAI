The MYStIX project (Massive Young Star-Forming Complex Study in Infrared and X-rays) provides
a comparative study of 20 Galactic massive star-forming complexes (d = 0.4 to 3.6 kpc). Probable
stellar members in each target complex are identified using X-ray and/or infrared data via two pathways:
(1) X-ray detections of young/massive stars with coronal activity/strong winds; or (2) infrared
excess (IRE) selection of young stellar objects (YSOs) with circumstellar disks and/or protostellar
envelopes. We present the methodology for the second pathway, using Spitzer/IRAC, 2MASS, and UKIRT
imaging and photometry. Although IRE selection of YSOs is welltrodden territory, MYStIX presents
unique challenges. We combine IR spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with IR color cuts
and spatial clustering analysis to identify IRE sources and isolate probable YSO members in each
MYStIX target field from the myriad types of contaminating sources that can resemble YSOs: extragalactic
sources, evolved stars, nebular knots, and even unassociated foreground/background YSOs. Applying
our methodology consistently across 18 of the target complexes, we produce the MYStIX IRE Source
(MIRES) Catalog comprising 20,719 sources, including 8686 probable stellar members of the MYStIX
target complexes. We also classify the SEDs of 9365 IR counterparts to MYStIX X-ray sources to assist
the first pathway, the identification of X-ray detected stellar members. The MIRES catalog provides
a foundation for follow-up studies of diverse phenomena related to massive star cluster formation,
including protostellar outflows, circumstellar disks, and sequential star formation triggered
by massive star feedback processes.
