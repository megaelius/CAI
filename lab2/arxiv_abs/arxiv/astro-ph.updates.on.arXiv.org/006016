Recent observations suggest a scenario in which filamentary structures in the ISM represent the
first step towards clumps/cores and eventually star formation. The densest filaments would then
fragment into prestellar cores owing to gravitational instability. We seek to understand the roles
filamentary structures play in high-mass star formation. We mapped the integral-shaped filament
(ISF) in NH3 (1, 1) and (2, 2). The whole filamentary structure is uniformly and fully sampled. We
find that the morphology revealed by the map of velocity-integrated intensity of the NH3 (1, 1) line
is closely associated with the dust ridge. We identify 6 "clumps" related to the well known OMC-1
to 5 and 11 "sub-clumps" within the map and they are separated not randomly but in roughly equal intervals
along the ISF. The average spacing of clumps is 11.30'$\pm$1.31' (1.36$\pm$0.16 pc ) and the average
spacing of sub-clumps is 7.18'$\pm$1.19' (0.86$\pm$0.14 pc). These spacings agree well with the
predicted values of the thermal (0.86 pc) and turbulent sausage instability (1.43 pc) by adopting
a cylindric geometry of the ISF with an inclination of $60^{\circ}$ with respect to the line of sight.
We also find a velocity gradient of about 0.6 km s-1 pc-1 that runs along the ISF which likely arises
from an overall rotation of the Orion A molecular cloud. The inferred ratio between rotational and
gravitational energy is well below unity. Furthermore, fluctuations are seen in the centroid velocity
diagram along the ISF. The OMC-1 to 5 clouds are located close to the local extrema of the fluctuations,
which suggests that there exist gas flows associated with these clumps in the ISF. The derived NH3
(1, 1) and (2, 2) rotation temperatures in the OMC-1 are about 30-40 K. In OMC-2, OMC-3, and the northern
part of OMC-4, we find higher and lower temperatures at the boundaries and in the interior, respectively.
