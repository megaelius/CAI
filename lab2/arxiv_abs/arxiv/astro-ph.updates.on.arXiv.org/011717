Future space telescopes now in the concept and design stage aim to observe reflected light spectra
of extrasolar planets. Assessing whether given notional mission and instrument design parameters
will provide data suitable for constraining quantities of interest typically requires time consuming
retrieval studies in which tens to hundreds of thousands of models are compared to data with a given
assumed signal to noise ratio, thereby limiting the rapidity of design iterations. Here we present
a novel machine learning approach employing five Multilayer Perceptron's (MLP) trained on model
albedo spectra of extrasolar giant planets to estimate a planet's atmospheric metallicity, gravity,
effective temperature, and cloud properties given simulated observed spectra. The stand-alone
C++ code we have developed can train new MLP's on new training sets, within minutes to hours, depending
upon the dimensions of input spectra and desired output. After the MLP is trained, it can classify
new input spectra within a second, potentially helping speed observation and mission design planning.
Four of the MLP's were tuned to work with various levels of spectral noise. The fifth MLP was developed
for cases where the user is uncertain about the noise level. The MLP's were trained using a grid of
model spectra that varied in metallicity, gravity, temperature, and cloud properties. We tested
the MLP on noisy models and observed spectra of both Jupiter and Saturn. The root mean squared error
when applied to noisy models were on the order of the model grid intervals. The results show that a
trained MLP is a robust means for reliable in-situ estimations, providing an elegant artificial
intelligence that is simple to customize and quick to use.
