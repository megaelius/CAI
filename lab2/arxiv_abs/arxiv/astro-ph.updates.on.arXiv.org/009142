Sharpless 269 (S269) is one of a few HII regions in the outer spiral arm of the Milky Way with strong
water maser emission. Based on data from the Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Exploration
of Radio Astrometry (VERA) array, two parallax measurements have been published, which differ
by nearly $2\sigma$. Each distance estimate supports a different structure for the outer arm. Moreover,
given its large Galactocentric radii, S269 has special relevance as its proper motion and parallax
have been used to constrain the Galactic rotation curve at large radii. Using recent Very Long Baseline
Array (VLBA) observations, we accurately measure the parallax and proper motion of the water masers
in S269. We interpret the position and motion of S269 in the context of Galactic structure, and possible
optical counterparts. S269's 22 GHz water masers and two close-by quasars were observed at 16 epochs
between 2015 and 2016 using the VLBA. We measure an annual parallax for S269 of 0.241 $\pm$ 0.012 mas
corresponding to a distance from the Sun of $4.15^{+0.22}_{-0.20}$ kpc by fitting four maser spots.
The mean proper motion for S269 was estimated as $0.16\pm0.26$ mas $\rm{yr^{-1}}$ and $-0.51\pm0.26$
mas $\rm{yr^{-1}}$ for $\mu_{\alpha} \ cos \delta$ and $\mu_{\delta}$ respectively, which corresponds
to the motion expected for a flat Galactic rotation curve at large radius. This distance estimate,
Galactic kinematic simulations and observations of other massive young stars in the outer region
support the existence of a kink in the outer arm at $l \approx$ 140 degrees. Additionally, we find
more than 2,000 optical sources in the Gaia DR2 catalog within 125 pc radius around the 3D position
of the water maser emission; from those only three sources are likely members of the same stellar
association that contains the young massive star responsible for the maser emission (S269 IRS 2w).
