In the hierarchical model of structure formation, giant elliptical galaxies form through merging
processes within the highest density peaks known as protoclusters. While high-redshift radio
galaxies usually pinpoint the location of these environments, we have recently discovered at z~2-3
three Enormous (>200 kpc) Lyman-Alpha Nebulae (ELANe) that host multiple AGN and that are surrounded
by overdensities of Lyman-alpha Emitters (LAE). These regions are prime candidates of massive
protoclusters in the early stages of assembly. To characterize the star-forming activity within
these rare structures - both on ELAN and protocluster scales - we have initiated an observational
campaign with the JCMT and the APEX telescopes. In this paper we report on sensitive SCUBA-2/JCMT
850 and 450 $\mu$m observations of a 128 arcmin$^2$ field comprising the ELAN MAMMOTH-1, together
with the peak of the hosting BOSS1441 LAE overdensity at z=2.32. These observations unveil $4.0\pm1.3$
times higher source counts at 850 $\mu$m with respect to blank fields, likely confirming the presence
of an overdensity also in obscured tracers. We find a strong detection at 850 $\mu$m associated with
the continuum source embedded within the ELAN MAMMOTH-1, which - together with the available data
from the literature - allow us to constrain the spectral energy distribution of this source to be
of an ULIRG with a far-infrared luminosity of $L_{\rm FIR}^{\rm SF}=2.4^{+7.4}_{-2.1}\times10^{12}$
L$_{\odot}$, and hosting an obscured AGN. Such a source is thus able to power the hard photoionization
plus outflow scenario depicted in Cai et al. (2017b) to explain the extended Lyman-alpha, HeII$\lambda1640$
and CIV$\lambda1549$ emission, and their kinematics. In addition, the two brightest detections
at 850 $\mu$m ($f_{850}>18$ mJy) sit at the density peak of the LAEs overdensity, likely pinpointing
the core of the protocluster.
