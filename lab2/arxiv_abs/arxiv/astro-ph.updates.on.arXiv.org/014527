The nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A belongs to a class of Active Galaxies that are very luminous at
radio wavelengths. The majority of these galaxies show collimated relativistic outflows known
as jets, that extend over hundreds of thousands of parsecs for the most powerful sources. Accretion
of matter onto the central super-massive black hole is believed to fuel these jets and power their
emission, with the radio emission being related to the synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons
in magnetic fields. The origin of the extended X-ray emission seen in the kiloparsec-scale jets
from these sources is still a matter of debate, although Cen A's X-ray emission has been suggested
to originate in electron synchrotron processes. The other possible explanation is Inverse Compton
(IC) scattering with CMB soft photons. Synchrotron radiation needs ultra-relativistic electrons
($\sim50$ TeV), and given their short cooling times, requires some continuous re-acceleration
mechanism to be active. IC scattering, on the other hand, does not require very energetic electrons,
but requires jets that stay highly relativistic on large scales ($\geq$1 Mpc) and that remain well-aligned
with the line of sight. Some recent evidence disfavours inverse Compton-CMB models, although other
evidence seems to be compatible with them. In principle, the detection of extended gamma-ray emission,
directly probing the presence of ultra-relativistic electrons, could distinguish between these
options, but instruments have hitherto been unable to resolve the relevant structures. At GeV energies
there is also an unusual spectral hardening in Cen A, whose explanation is unclear. Here we report
observations of Cen A at TeV energies that resolve its large-scale jet. We interpret the data as evidence
for the acceleration of ultra-relativistic electrons in the jet, and favour the synchrotron explanation
for the X-rays.
