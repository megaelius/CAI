Identifying the compact object in ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) has to-date required detection
of pulsations or a cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF), indicating a magnetised neutron
star. However, pulsations are observed to be transient and it is plausible that accretion onto the
neutron star may have suppressed the surface magnetic field such that pulsations and CRSFs will
be entirely absent. We may therefore lack direct means to identify neutron star systems whilst we
presently lack any means to identify a black hole ULX. Here we present a possible method to begin separating
the ULX population by assuming the mHz timescale X-ray quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and
day timescale periods/QPOs are associated with Lense-Thirring precession of the inflow and outflowing
wind respectively. The precession timescales combined with the temperature of the soft X-ray component
produce planes where the accretor mass enters as a free parameter. Depending on the properties of
the wind, use of these planes may be robust to a range in the angular momentum (spin) and, for high accretion
rates, essentially independent of the neutron star's surface dipole field strength. Our model
also predicts the mHz QPO frequency and magnitude of the phase-lag imprinted due to propagation
through the optically thick wind; in the case of NGC 5408 X-1 we subsequently infer a black hole mass
and moderate-to-high spin. Finally, we note that observing secular QPO evolution over sufficient
baselines may indicate a neutron star as the precession responds to spin-up which is not readily
observable for black hole primaries.
