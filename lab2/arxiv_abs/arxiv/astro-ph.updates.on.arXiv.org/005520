Galaxy clusters at high redshifts are key targets for understanding matter assembly in the early
Universe, yet they are challenging to locate. A sample of >2000 high-z candidate structures have
been found using Planck's all-sky submm maps, and a subset of 234 have been followed up with Herschel-SPIRE,
which showed that the emission can be attributed to large overdensities of dusty star-forming (SF)
galaxies. However, the individual galaxies have not yet been resolved nor characterized, so we
do not know whether they constitute the progenitors of present-day, massive galaxy clusters. We
targeted the 8 brightest SPIRE sources in the centre of the Planck peak G073.4-57.5 using ALMA at
1.3mm, and complemented these observations with data from IRAC, WIRCam J,K, and SCUBA-2. We detect
a total of 18 millimetre galaxies brighter than 0.3mJy in 2.4arcmin^2. The ALMA source density is
8-30 times higher than average background estimates, and larger than seen in typical "proto-cluster"
fields. We are able to match all but one ALMA sources to their NIR counterparts. The most significant
(four) SCUBA-2 sources are not included in the ALMA pointings, but we find an 8sigma stacking detection
of the ALMA sources in the SCUBA-2 map at 850um. We derive photo-z, L_IR, SFR, M_*, T_dust, and M_dust
for all the ALMA galaxies; the photo-zs are concentrated around z=1.5 and the near-IR colours show
a "red" sequence, while the SFRs indicate that one third of the galaxies are "starbursts," the others
being main-sequence (MS) SF galaxies. Serendipitous CO line detections of two of the galaxies appear
to match their photo-zs, with z = 1.54. We thus find that the Planck peak G073.4-57.5 contains a proto-cluster
candidate at z=1.54, and one of the richest regions of ALMA sources known. The ALMA-detected members
are massive galaxies on the MS relation and account for a total SFR of at least 1000MSun/yr.
