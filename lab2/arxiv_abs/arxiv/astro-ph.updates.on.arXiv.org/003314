In what is being dubbed as the great American solar eclipse, on 21 August 2017, a total solar eclipse
will sweep across the continental Unites States. Given the path of the eclipse and the length of totality
available for eclipse observations, this eclipse will offer unprecedented opportunities for
observations of the Sun's coronal structure and diagnostics of the coronal magnetic field. The
Sun's coronal magnetic field is notoriously difficult to constrain and theoretical computational
models must be relied upon for gaining insight on the coronal structure. Well-constrained solar
coronal field models are crucial for understanding the origin of, and predicting solar storms that
generate severe space weather. Here we present a technique for predicting and inferring the structure
of the coronal field based on a data driven solar surface flux transport model which is forward run
to 21 August 2017 to predict the Sun's surface field distribution. The predicted solar surface field
is subsequently used as input in a potential field source surface model to generate the coronal structure
during the imminent solar eclipse. Our results -- which can be verified during the 21 August 2017
eclipse observations -- indicate the presence of two helmet streamers, one each in the eastern and
western limb on the southern solar hemisphere and significant radial open-flux at the poles indicating
the accumulation of unipolar, polar fields in the build-up to the minimum of sunspot cycle 24. The
South (open) polar flux appears to be stronger indicating an asymmetric sunspot cycle 25 with stronger
activity in the southern hemisphere. The CESSI prediction of the coronal field expected during
the 21 August, 2017 great American solar eclipse, accompanying images and data is available at the
