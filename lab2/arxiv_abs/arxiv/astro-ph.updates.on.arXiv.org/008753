The NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is about to provide full-frame images
of almost the entire sky. The amount of stellar data to be analysed represents hundreds of millions
stars, which is several orders of magnitude above the amount of stars observed by CoRoT, Kepler,
or K2 missions. We aim at automatically classifying the newly observed stars, with near real-time
algorithms, to better guide their subsequent detailed studies. In this paper, we present a classification
algorithm built to recognise solar-like pulsators among classical pulsators, which relies on
the global amount of power contained in the PSD, also known as the FliPer (Flicker in spectral Power
density). As each type of pulsating star has a characteristic background or pulsation pattern,
the shape of the PSD at different frequencies can be used to characterise the type of pulsating star.
The FliPer Classifier (FliPer$_{Class}$) uses different FliPer parameters along with the effective
temperature as input parameters to feed a machine learning algorithm in order to automatically
classify the pulsating stars observed by TESS. Using noisy TESS simulated data from the TESS Asteroseismic
Science Consortium (TASC), we manage to classify pulsators with a 98% accuracy. Among them, solar-like
pulsating stars are recognised with a 99% accuracy, which is of great interest for further seismic
analysis of these stars like our Sun. Similar results are obtained when training our classifier
and applying it to 27 days subsets of real Kepler data. FliPer$_{Class}$ is part of the large TASC
classification pipeline developed by the TESS Data for Asteroseismology (T'DA) classification
working group.
