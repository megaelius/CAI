We use synthetic sightlines drawn through snapshots of the Technicolor Dawn simulations to explore
how the statistics of neutral oxygen OI absorbers respond to hydrogen reionization. The ionization
state of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) initially roughly tracks that of the intergalactic medium,
but beginning at $z=8$ the CGM grows systematically more neutral owing to self-shielding. Weak
absorbers trace diffuse gas that lies farther from halos, hence they are ionized first, whereas
stronger systems are less sensitive to reionization. The overall OI covering fraction decreases
slowly with time owing to competition between ongoing enrichment and gradual encroachment of ionization
fronts into increasingly overdense gas. While the declining covering fraction is partially offset
by continued formation of new halos, the ionization of the diffuse gas causes the predicted line-of-sight
incidence rate of OI absorbers to decline abruptly at the overlap epoch, in qualitative agreement
with observations. In comparison to the recently-observed equivalent width (EW) distribution
at $z\approx6$, the simulations underproduce systems with $EW \geq 0.1 \unicode{x212B}$, although
they reproduce weaker systems with $EW \geq 0.05 \unicode{x212B}$. By $z\approx5$, the incidence
of $EW < 0.1 \unicode{x212B}$ systems are overproduced, consistent with previous indications
that the simulated ionizing background is too weak at $z<6$. The summed column densities of SiII
and SiIV trace the total oxygen column, and hence the ratio of the OI and SiII + SiIV comoving mass densities
traces the progress of reionization. This probe may prove particularly useful in the regime where
$x_{HI} > 10\%$
