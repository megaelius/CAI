A hotspot at a position compatible with the BL Lac object 1ES 2322-409 was serendipitously detected
with H.E.S.S. during observations performed in 2004 and 2006 on the blazar PKS 2316-423. Additional
data on 1ES 2322-409 were taken in 2011 and 2012, leading to a total live-time of 22.3h. Point-like
very-high-energy (VHE; E>100GeV) $\gamma$-ray emission is detected from a source centred on the
1ES 2322-409 position, with an excess of 116.7 events at a significance of 6.0$\sigma$. The average
VHE $\gamma$-ray spectrum is well described with a power law with a photon index $\Gamma=3.40\pm0.66_{\text{stat}}\pm0.20_{\text{sys}}$
and an integral flux $\Phi(E>200GeV) = (3.11\pm0.71_{\rm stat}\pm0.62_{\rm sys})\times10^{-12}
cm^{-2} s^{-1}$, which corresponds to 1.1$\%$ of the Crab nebula flux above 200 GeV. Multi-wavelength
data obtained with Fermi LAT, Swift XRT and UVOT, RXTE PCA, ATOM, and additional data from WISE, GROND
and Catalina, are also used to characterise the broad-band non-thermal emission of 1ES 2322-409.
The multi-wavelength behaviour indicates day-scale variability. Swift UVOT and XRT data show
strong variability at longer scales. A spectral energy distribution (SED) is built from contemporaneous
observations obtained around a high state identified in Swift data. A modelling of the SED is performed
with a stationary homogeneous one-zone synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) leptonic model. The redshift
of the source being unknown, two plausible values were tested for the modelling. A systematic scan
of the model parameters space is performed, resulting in a well-constrained combination of values
providing a good description of the broad-band behaviour of 1ES 2322-409.
