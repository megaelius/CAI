Gamma-ray burst afterglows arise from relativistic collisionless shocks in which the postshock
tangled magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is produced by the two-stream and/or Weibel instabilities on
plasma skin-depth scales $(c/\omega_p)$. The field is expected to be oriented predominantly within
the shock plane ($B_{\perp}$; transverse to the shock normal, $\hat{n}_{\rm{sh}}$), and is often
approximated to be completely within it ($B_\parallel\equiv\hat{n}_{\rm{sh}}\,\cdot\,\vec{B}=0$).
Current 2D/3D particle-in-cell simulations are limited to short timescales and box sizes $\lesssim10^4(c/\omega_p)\ll
R/\Gamma_{\rm{sh}}$ much smaller than the shocked region's comoving width, and cannot probe the
asymptotic downstream $\vec{B}$ structure. We constrain the latter using the linear polarization
upper limit, $\vert\Pi\vert<12\%$, on the radio afterglow of GW170817/GRB170817A. Afterglow
polarization depends on the jet's angular structure, our viewing angle, and the $\vec{B}$ structure.
In GW170817/GRB170817A the latter can be tightly constrained since the former two are constrained
from observations. We model $\vec{B}$ as an isotropic field in 3D that is stretched along $\hat{n}_{\rm{sh}}$
by a factor $\xi\equiv{}B_{\parallel}/B_{\perp}$, whose initial value $\xi_f\equiv{}B_{\parallel,f}/B_{\perp,f}$
describes the field that survives downstream on plasma scales $\ll{}R/\Gamma_{\rm{sh}}$. We
calculate $\Pi(\xi_f)$ by integrating over the shocked volume for core-dominated structured
jets, with a local Blandford-McKee self-similar radial profile. We find that independent of the
exact jet structure, $\vec{B}$ has a finite, but initially sub-dominant, parallel component:
$0.57\lesssim\xi_f\lesssim0.89$, making it less anisotropic. While this motivates numerical
studies of the asymptotic $\vec{B}$ structure in relativistic collisionless shocks, it may be
consistent with turbulence amplified magnetic field.
