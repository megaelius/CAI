The high quality light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) represent
a unique laboratory for the study of stellar rotation, a fundamental observable driving stellar
and planetary evolution, including planetary atmospheres and impacting on habitability conditions
and the genesis of life around stars. As of April 14th 2020, this mission delivered public light curves
for 1000 TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs), observed with 2 minute cadence during the first 20 months
of the mission. Here, we present a search for rotation signatures in these TOIs, using Fast Fourier
Transform, Lomb-Scargle, and wavelet techniques, accompanied by a rigorous visual inspection.
This effort revealed 163 targets with rotation signatures, 131 of which present unambiguous rotation
periods ranging from 0.321 and 13.219 days, whereas 32 of them present dubious rotation periodicities.
One hundred and nine of these stars show flux fluctuations whose root-cause is not clearly identified.
For 714 TOIs, the light curves show a noisy behavior, corresponding to typically low-amplitude
signals. Our analysis has also revealed 10 TOI stars with pulsation periodicities ranging from
0.049 to 2.995 days and four eclipsing binaries. With upcoming TESS data releases, our periodicity
analysis will be expanded to almost all TOI stars, thereby contributing in defining criteria for
follow-up strategy itself, and the study of star-planet interactions, surface dynamic of host
stars and habitability conditions in planets, among other aspects. In this context, a living catalog
is maintained on the Filtergraph visualization portal at the URL https://filtergraph.com/tess_rotation_tois.
