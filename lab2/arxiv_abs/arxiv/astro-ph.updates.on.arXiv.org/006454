Proxima Centauri, our closest stellar neighbour, is a low-mass M5 dwarf orbiting in a triple system.
An Earth-mass planet with an 11 day period has been discovered around this star. The star's mass has
been estimated only indirectly using a mass-luminosity relation, meaning that large uncertainties
affect our knowledge of its properties. To refine the mass estimate, an independent method has been
proposed: gravitational microlensing. By taking advantage of the close passage of Proxima Cen
in front of two background stars, it is possible to measure the astrometric shift caused by the microlensing
effect due to these close encounters and estimate the gravitational mass of the lens (Proxima Cen).
Microlensing events occurred in 2014 and 2016 with impact parameters, the closest approach of Proxima
Cen to the background star, of 1\farcs6 $\pm$ 0\farcs1 and 0\farcs5 $\pm$ 0\farcs1, respectively.
Accurate measurements of the positions of the background stars during the last two years have been
obtained with HST/WFC3, and with VLT/SPHERE from the ground. The SPHERE campaign started on March
2015, and continued for more than two years, covering 9 epochs. The parameters of Proxima Centauri's
motion on the sky, along with the pixel scale, true North, and centering of the instrument detector
were readjusted for each epoch using the background stars visible in the IRDIS field of view. The
experiment has been successful and the astrometric shift caused by the microlensing effect has
been measured for the second event in 2016. We used this measurement to derive a mass of 0.150$^{\textrm{+}0.062}_{-0.051}$
(an error of $\sim$ 40\%) \MSun for Proxima Centauri acting as a lens. This is the first and the only
currently possible measurement of the gravitational mass of Proxima Centauri.
