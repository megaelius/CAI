High-mass analogues of low-mass prestellar cores are searched for to constrain the models of high-mass
star formation. Several high-mass cores, at various evolutionary stages, have been recently identified
towards the massive star-forming region W43-MM1 and amongst them a high-mass prestellar core candidate.
We aim to characterise the chemistry in this high-mass prestellar core candidate, referred to as
W43-MM1 core #6, and its environment. Using ALMA high-spatial resolution data of W43-MM1, we have
studied the molecular content of core #6 and a neighbouring high-mass protostellar core, referred
to as #3, which is similar in size and mass to core #6. We first subtracted the continuum emission using
a method based on the density distribution of the intensities on each pixel. Then, from the distribution
of detected molecules, we identified the molecules centred on the prestellar core candidate (core
#6) and those associated to shocks related to outflows and filament formation. Then we constrained
the column densities and temperatures of the molecules detected towards the two cores. While core
#3 appears to contain a hot core with a temperature of about 190 K, core #6 seems to have a lower temperature
in the range from 20 K to 90 K from a rotational diagram analysis. We have considered different source
sizes for core #6 and the comparison of the abundances of the detected molecules towards the core
with various interstellar sources shows that it is compatible with a core of size 1000 au with $T =
20-90$ K or a core of size 500 au with $T \sim 80$ K. Core #6 of W43-MM1 remains one of the best high-mass
prestellar core candidates even if we cannot exclude that it is at the very beginning of the protostellar
phase of high-mass star formation.
