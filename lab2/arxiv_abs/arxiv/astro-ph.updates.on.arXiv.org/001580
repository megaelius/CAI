Dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies have emerged a powerful probe of small-scale dark matter clustering
and of cosmic reionization. They exhibit structural and chemical continuity with dwarf irregular
galaxies in the field and with spheroidal galaxies in high-density environments. By combining
empirical constraints derived for star formation at low gas column densities and metallicities
in the local universe with a model for dark matter and baryonic mass assembly, we provide an analytical
description of how the dwarf spheroidals acquired their stellar content. Their progenitors formed
stars until the gas content, initially reduced from the cosmic average by the thermal pressure of
the reionized intergalactic medium, was finally ram pressure stripped during the progenitors'
accretion on to the host galaxy. Dwarf spheroidal satellites of differing luminosities seem to
share very similar most massive progenitor histories that reach thresholds for gas cooling by atomic
line emission at epochs at which the Lagrangian volume of the Local Group should have been reionized.
We hypothesize that dwarf spheroidals formed the bulk of their stars in partially rotationally
supported HI disks in a reionized universe. This model provides an explanation for the "common mass
scale" relation and reproduces the empirical luminosity-size and luminosity-metallicity relations.
Explosive feedback phenomena, such as outflows driven by the concerted action of supernovae, need
not have been significant in the dwarf spheroidals' formation. We further speculate that the true
pre-reionization fossils should exhibit a structure distinct from that of the dwarf spheroidals,
e.g., in the form of dense isolated or nuclear star clusters.
