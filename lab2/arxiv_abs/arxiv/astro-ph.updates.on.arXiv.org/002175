We examine the connection between the observed "star-forming sequence" (SFR $\propto$ M$_{*}^{\alpha}$)
and the observed evolution of the stellar mass function between $0.2 < z < 2.5$. We find that
the star-forming sequence cannot have a slope $\alpha$ $\lesssim$ 0.9 at all masses and redshifts,
as this results in a much higher number density at $10 < \log(\mathrm{M}) < 11$ by $z=1$ than
is observed. We show that a transition in the slope of the star-forming sequence, such that $\alpha=1$
at $\log(M)<10.5$ and $\alpha=0.7-0.13z$ \citep{whitaker12} at $\log(M)>10.5$, greatly
improves agreement with the evolution of the stellar mass function. We then construct a star-forming
sequence which exactly reproduces the evolution of the mass function. This star-forming sequence
is also well-described by a broken-power law, with a shallow slope at high masses and a steep slope
at low masses. At $z=2$, it is offset by $\sim$0.3 dex from the observed star-forming sequence, consistent
with the mild disagreement between the cosmic SFR and the growth of the stellar mass density in recent
determinations of the mass function. It is unclear whether this problem stems from errors in stellar
mass estimates, errors in SFRs, or other effects. We show that a mass-dependent slope is also seen
in self-consistent theoretical models of galaxy evolution, including semi-analytical, hydrodynamical,
and abundance-matching models. As part of the analysis, we show that neither mergers nor an unknown
population of quiescent galaxies are likely to reconcile the evolution of the low-mass stellar
mass function and the observed star-forming sequence. These results are supported by observations
from Whitaker et al. (2014).
