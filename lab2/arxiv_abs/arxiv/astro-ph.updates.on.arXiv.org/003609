Context: In the last six years, the VVV survey mapped 562 sq. deg. across the bulge and southern disk
of the Galaxy. However, a detailed study of these regions, which includes $\sim 36$ globular clusters
(GCs) and thousands of open clusters is by no means an easy challenge. High differential reddening
and severe crowding along the line of sight makes highly hamper to reliably distinguish stars belonging
to different populations and/or systems. Aims: The aim of this study is to separate stars that likely
belong to the Galactic GC NGC 6544 from its surrounding field by means of proper motion (PM) techniques.
Methods: This work was based upon a new astrometric reduction method optimized for images of the
VVV survey. Results: Photometry over the six years baseline of the survey allowed us to obtain a mean
precision of $\sim0.51$ mas/yr, in each PM coordinate, for stars with Ks < 15 mag. In the area studied
here, cluster stars separate very well from field stars, down to the main sequence turnoff and below,
allowing us to derive for the first time the absolute PM of NGC 6544. Isochrone fitting on the clean
and differential reddening corrected cluster color magnitude diagram yields an age of $\sim$ 11-13
Gyr, and metallicity [Fe/H] = -1.5 dex, in agreement with previous studies restricted to the cluster
core. We were able to derive the cluster orbit assuming an axisymmetric model of the Galaxy and conclude
that NGC 6544 is likely a halo GC. We have not detected tidal tail signatures associated to the cluster,
but a remarkable elongation in the galactic center direction has been found. The precision achieved
in the PM determination also allows us to separate bulge stars from foreground disk stars, enabling
the kinematical selection of bona fide bulge stars across the whole survey area. Our results show
that VVV data is perfectly suitable for this kind of analysis.
