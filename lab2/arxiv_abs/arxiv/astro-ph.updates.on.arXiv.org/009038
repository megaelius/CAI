Analyses of Galactic late O dwarfs (O8-O9.5V stars) raised the `weak wind problem': spectroscopic
mass loss rates ($\dot{M}$) are up to two orders of magnitude lower than the theoretical values.
We investigated the stellar and wind properties of Galactic late O giants (O8-O9.5III stars). We
performed a spectroscopic analysis of nine O8-O9.5III stars in the ultraviolet (UV) and optical
regions using the model atmosphere code CMFGEN. From the UV region, we found $\dot{M}$ $\sim$ $10^{-8}-10^{-9}$
$\mathrm{M_\odot}$ $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ in overall. This is lower by $\approx 0.9 - 2.3$ dex than
the predicted values based on the (global) conservation of energy in the wind. $\dot{M}$ predicted
from first principles, based on the moving reversing layer theory, agrees better with our findings,
but it fails to match the spectroscopic $\dot{M}$ for the most luminous OB stars. The region of $\log(L_\star/L_\odot)
\approx 5.2$ is critical for both sets of predictions in comparison with the spectroscopic mass-loss
rates. CMFGEN models with the predicted $\dot{M}$ (the former one) fail to reproduce the UV wind
lines for all stars of our sample. We reproduce the observed H$\alpha$ profiles of four objects with
our $\dot{M}$ derived from the UV. Hence, low $\dot{M}$ values (weak winds) are favored to fit the
observations (UV + optical), but discrepancies between the UV and H$\alpha$ diagnostics remain
for some objects. Our results indicate weak winds beyond the O8-9.5V class, being the region of $\log(L_\star/L_\odot)
\approx 5.2$ indeed critical to the weak wind phenomenon. Since O8-O9.5III stars are more evolved
than O8-9.5V, evolutionary effects do not seem to play a role on the onset of the weak wind phenomenon.
These findings support that $\dot{M}$ (for low luminosity O stars) in use in the majority of modern
stellar evolution codes must be severely overestimated up to the end of H-burning phase.
